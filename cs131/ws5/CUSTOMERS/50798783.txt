US	50798783	R1P2FOOO13E7IL	0131934821	167571789	The Crisis of Church and State, 1050-1300. With Selected Documents.	Books	5	42	45	N	N	Where freedom came from.	This book contains many of the critical documents that trace the origin of Western freedoms.  Tierney prefaces the main body of his material with a few short but fascinating passages from and on people like Ambrose and Augustine.  In the following chapters, he traces the debate about the relationship between Church and State as it developed in three or four dozen key documents from 1050 to 1300.  Tierney helpfully sets context for each passage.  In some, popes and kings jockey for power; in others, thinkers offer balanced or didactically one-sided solutions.  <br />Again and again one notes key NT passages coming up, like &quot;My kingdom is not of this world,&quot; and &quot;Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.&quot;  As Tierney notes, the influence of Christianity on the proceedings are clear in two ways: first, &quot;The very existence of two power structures competing for men's allegiance greatly enhanced the possibilities for human freedom.&quot;  And second, &quot;The possibility of a continuing tension between church and state was inherent in th every beginnings of the Christian religion.&quot;  The documents eloquently demonstrate these points for themselves.  The interest is not always in big themes, however, but often in human and even humorous details.  Tierney's selection is varied.    <br />Anyone who thinks modern freedom was an escape from Medieval despotism or ex nihilo invention of the Enlightenment, or that all religions are the same, and theological differences between religions have little practical effect, should carefully read this book.  Clearly, the Grand Inquisitor is not the whole story, nor the big story, of the Middle Ages.  Donald Treadgold's Freedom: A History, also makes some good comparative points in relation to other cultures.  But there is nothing like going to the original sources for getting a feel for what people really thought, and why they thought it.  An excellent resource.	2003-02-07

The title \\"Trail of Tears\\" brings to mind a simple, dramatic outline.  Cherokees adapt to the coming of white men by borrowing \\"civilized arts,\\" but in the end are cruelly and uncivilly displaced from their homes to reservations in the West.  This book does tell that trajedy.  But Ehle gives more of a social and sometimes anthropological history, not a melodrama or sermon.  He describes Cherokee customs, tells the story of two leading Cherokee families, and also offers a series of snapshots of contemporary American culture (or cultures): frontiermen and missionary, statesmen and black slave.  Both Indians and whites come across as more complex and varied than any derivative of either the John Wayne or the Noble Savage stereotype: Ehle is a historian, not a historicist, and allows facts, events, and letters to speak for themselves without undue manipulation.  The details he selects are usually interesting, and my net impression is of meeting real human beings. <br />The contrast between missionaries and full-blooded Cherokees could easily descend to hagiography or satire, but Ehle manages instead to show something of the nobility, and the blindness, on both sides of that particular conflict.  Georgia legislators and frontiersmen come across a bit more negatively, but appear to have no one to blame for that but themselves.  Ehle does not press the point, but there is a lot of food for thought and fruitful national soul-searching here.    <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2003-02-03

Anthony Storr examines the lives of an odd assortment of nine \\"gurus\\" (with reference to others along the way): Jones, Koresh, Gurdjieff, Rajneesh, Rudolf Steiner, Jung, Freud, Loyola, and Jesus. He argues that gurus tends to share a number of characteristics, he argues: isolation as children, mental distress followed by \\"revelation,\\" intolerance of criticism, elitism, hatred of rules, love of speaking and travel, charisma, narcisism, and a delusional worldview.  Other religious leaders who fit this pattern -- Buddha, Krishnamurti, Mohammed, Hong Xiuquan -- do come to mind. But Storr does not clearly list all these characteristics in one place or clarify which are necessary. This makes his argument fuzzy around the edges. <br />The most interesting part of the book for me was the account of the lives of individual gurus. Gurdjieff believed the moon controlled human action: he was literally a \\"lunatic.\\"  Jung and Freud didn't entirely fit Storr's profile, but his take on them was fair enough, I think.  <br />Storr's discussion of my guru, Jesus, seemed contrived.  He did not seem too familiar with primary sources, but appeared to filter perception through modern skeptics, respected (Sanders) and dubious (A.N. Wilson). (Nothing from good opposing opinions like N.T. Wright.) Neglect of primary documents may be what Storr calls \\"science\\" (a word of which he is fond), but is not good historical method.  Thus, he quoted a couple Gospel passages (one very misleadingly) to argue that Jesus was hostile to families.  But the Gospels show Jesus was obedient to his parents as a child, had frequent contact with mother and siblings during his ministry (even helping Mom at a wedding) and took thought for her during his death.  And Jesus' disciples married. Storr ignores all that: he has a theory to prove. It is plausible, (though not, in my view, reasonable) to dismiss the Gospels as unreliable. But to conjecture about Jesus' psychological state based on second-hand \\"facts\\" that are explicitly denied by the primary documents -- that's not scholarship, it's witch-doctory. <br />Storr takes a similarly tunnel-visioned approach to other aspects of the Jesus question. He lamely ascribes the power of the Gospels to their position in the Western tradition. If that were so, why do many non-Westerners seem to agree with Lin Yutang, the Chinese scholar who anthologized Chinese and Indian literature, and concluded at the end of his life that \\"no one has ever taught as Jesus?\\"  Storr misses what is most obvious about the Gospels, whether because of over-familiarity, or a pandering, patronizing scientism, I'm not sure.  Storr is like a 3rd Grade grammar teacher who corrects the errors of his third graders, William Shakespeare, and Dostoevsky, all with the same confident frown on her face.    <br />Belief in a transcendent calling is delusional, hence a sign of psychic disturbance, only if one is wrong. Confucius believed he had a call from God to preserve the best in Chinese culture and teach China kindness, and that God would preserve his life in the meanwhile. Was he wrong? I would be seriously delusional to see myself as the greatest painter who ever lived.  Would Rembrandt? Storr claims to be an agnostic, but he dismisses all evidence for the supernatural without even considering it. He assumes, without argument, that anyone who thinks he has a revelation from God must be deluded, and that miracles are impossible. Then he bases a large part of his diagnosis of the most influential man in history on that assumption. It seems to me for a person claiming to be an agnostic such questions should not be considered settled apart from some mention of the evidence. <br />The book ends on two more odd notes. First, Storr repeats one of his themes: \\"morally superior individuals influence others by their private behavior rather than haranguing crowds.\\" Yet the book itself is more a harangue than private behavior. That's all right, were Storr being consistent.Good people have in fact often changed the world for the better by preaching. Secondly, Storr reminds us that \\"the wish to help is not confined to believers.\\"  Of course not.  But then, bizarrely, he ends by quoting Nietzche, who despised kind deeds, to support his point. <br />In the end, this is a difficult book to evaluate. Storr is bright, though not as bright as he obviously thinks, often sympathetic, and appears well-read in psychological literature. I found some of his ideas helpful. But somehow it seems rather tinny. Storr's level of insight is not nearly as deep as C.S.Lewis, (Four Loves and Trasposition are especially relevent), Rene Girard, or Lin Yutang. I suspect the Gnostic science vs. pre-science view from which he works is holding him back. He seems to view people from the outside, as a \\"scientist,\\" rather than from the inside, as a human being.  <br />Other readers may also find Vishal Mangalwadi's The World of the Gurus interesting. <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2002-12-19

It is not frivolous, except in the sense of parodying frivolity, nor is it flippant, nor even does it tell \\"jokes.\\"  Rather, it reveals (from the inside out) the bizarre, humorous truth about our own odd selves.  \\"How can a ghost feel otherwise toward a machine than bored?\\" \\"If (the primitologist) could converse with his chimpanzee, he would have the best of both worlds: (a) beat other scientists, and (b) have someone to talk to.\\"  \\"I am rascal, hero, craven, brave, treacherous, loyal, at once the secret hero and a-- of the universe.\\"  <br />This is the first book I've read from this author. I hope it won't be the last, though it will be if the cosmic gate crasher at the Donohue show turns up soon.  My first intuition was, \\"This man has read Pascal;\\" then I thought \\"Chesterton too.\\"  That gave me a hint as to where he was coming from, but he never did lay many cards on the table.  In fact, the whole book mostly consists of throwing cards up in the air and asking us to grab the right ones before they touch the ground.  <br />In a review of one of Chesterton's books (if you like this, see Orthodoxy and Everlasting Man in particular), I said Chesterton makes us laugh ourselves sane.  Percy pushes us in the same direction, with the cattle prod of humor.  He's more of a pessimist than Chesterton.  Sometimes he's wrong.  And once in a while he slips into mere crankiness: \\"For every Mother Theresa, there seem to be 1,800 nutty American nuns, female Clint Eastwoods who have it in for men and are out to get the Pope.\\"  He also seems to have it in for \\"fundamentalists\\" (whom he classifies with \\"chuckleheads,\\" unfairly in my perhaps minority experience) and Calvinists.  (The last line he gives John Calvin in his Donahue sketch sounds very Chestertonian.) But more like Pascal, Percy speaks the language of science as well as contemporary literature.  (And he pegs Carl Sagan just right.)<br />Think you've got life figured out?

This is how history ought to be written: witty, arising from magesterial study but focusing on telling details, sympathetic to a wide range of characters and beliefs and accomplishments (he comes close to getting both Pascal and Voltaire right), yet is also boldly partisan (of a party of one).  Barzun offers wonderful vignettes on the already-known, (Bacon, Luther, Descartes, Nietzche, and dozens more) and on characters most of us will find obscure.  Barzun gives only enough of politics and &quot;events&quot; to frame the story of western cultural life.  <br />Barzun throws the spot-light on his lesser-known subjects not for their benefit, he mostly convinces us, but for our own.  They belong closer to the center stream of Western thought than they are usually placed.  He devotes three pages to the 17th Century radical John Lilburne, whom he credits with precociously progressive views, obscure because he drew them unfashionably from St. Paul, rather than the laws of nature.  In the 20th Century, he devotes another three pages to Dorothy Sayers, bypassing orthodox co-conspirators like Lewis, Tolkien, and Chesterton.  But that provides relief: he keeps you on your toes.  Sometimes he seems to be overreaching, but his insights are usually interesting and there hardly seems to be a platitude in the book.  <br />The time frame Barzun chooses is of course arbitrary.  Some would say (and I think they're probably right) that the West was already set on the road to glory by date he chooses to open.  And the story seems to fizzle out in the end, not so much in decadence, as from the focusing effect of looking at an object that is too close to see clearly.  Also, in modern times boundaries between cultures have become porous; now we need a human story.  But within the broad frame of his work, almost every splash and dot is interesting.<br />author, True Son of Heaven	2002-12-07
US	50798783	R11UG2O98DVGBQ	0738203491	205572118	The Pleasure of Finding Things Out: The Best Short Works of Richard P. Feynman	Books	3	9	23	N	N	A grab-bag of a book.	This book is a hodge-podge of personal and professional reminiscenses and interviews.  Feynmann tells stories about building the A-bomb, his Dad, teaching his children, curiosity, learning, \\"the big picture,\\" and how he learned that different minds work differently.  I enjoyed parts of the book, particularly the parts most related to the book's title, like how his Father taught him scientific curiosity.  <br />It is obvious that a lot of people have respect for Feynman, and I don't doubt he earned it.  But as a story-teller, while he is sometimes interesting, frankly a lot of the time he is rather incoherent.  The interviews are especially inarticulate, fumbling for words.  I guess you had to be there.  Elsewhere, Feynman comes across as another famous scientist piddling in other fields in his spare time.  As an educator he is interesting, though not always fully syntactical.  What he teaches well is his own infectious enthusiasm for \\"finding things out.\\"  Like some other scientists who are not very familiar with other fields, he tends to depict that pleasure as an almost exclusively scientific one.  But of course Confucius, Origen, and Augustine knew the same pleasure, as do we in the contemporary humanities.  As a teacher myself, I agree that enthusiastic curiosity is itself the greatest lesson.  Feynman communicates that well, among other things.<br />Feynman admits that \\"in a field that is so complicated that true science is not able to get anywhere, we have to rely on a kind of old-fashioned wisdom.\\"  It would be truer to say that science is one in a continuum of epistomological methods, from the most direct (and limited), like math, to \\"hard sciences\\" like physics and chemistry, to \\"soft sciences\\" (paleontology) and up through history to psychology and finally theology.  Like many scientists, and antagonistic philosophers (Rorty), Feynman confuses epistomological \\"hardness\\" with rationality, in the sense of finding out what truly is, and being reasonably certain about it.  <br />The odd thing about Feynman's excursions into other fields is that he admits, \\"I'm still a very one-sided person and don't know a great deal.\\"  His editors think he's just being modest, I guess.  <br />Most of the time Feynman treats religion with formal respect (one gets the feeling he's been scolded before and doesn't want to pour oil on the fire).  He is, in fact, rather ignorant on the subject, refuting silly heresies, and thinking he has got to the heart of the matter.  At one point he compares the \\"Catholic religion in the Middle Ages\\" to Hitler and Stalin.  I'm not Catholic, but in my opinion that reflects poorly on his understanding of the historical roots of science and democracy.  For all Feynman's love of science, it's a pity he should be ignorant of where it came from.  <br />That such a grab-bag of a book would inspire the loyalty that is revealed in reviews below, is something I have great sympathy for.  But it also demonstrates what many observers have commented on, the priest-like status that scientists have attained in Western culture.  Books like this make me mourn for the sins of modern thought: over-specialization, the cults of celebrity and science, and philosophical confusion about how we know things.  The book did make me think about how to teach, however, and introduced me to an interesting scientist.   <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2002-11-08

This is a book I feel like applauding or booing, depending on whether I'm in the mood to count virtues or vices.  As for virtues, Sagan is not only a good writer, he comes across as a likable human being.  The book is personal and warm, passionate, thoughtful, and well-written.  It is full of interesting anecdotes, the point of which is well-stated.  One doesn't know whether to laugh or cry when reading Sagan's mail from alien abductees.  Maybe that's a test of our humanity.  (Or humility.)<br />Sagan's \\"baloney-detecting kit\\" is a useful set of principles for separating fact from fiction.  As a Christian scholar and skeptic of skepticism, I found myself breaking it out and using it, and related principles, right away.  <br />For example, when Sagan exphasizes how prone memory is to error.  \\"Our memories (like many preachers, Sagan is fond of saying \\"we\\" when he really seems to mean \\"you\\") are almost never challenged.  They can, instead, be frozen into place, no matter how flawed . . . or become a work of continual artistic revision.\\"  Some of Sagan's protegies, repeating these arguments, almost had me convinced.  (Skeptics, too, can avail themselves of the power of suggestibility.)  So I conducted an experiment with my students, and found short-term memory extremely accurate.  I also had a chance to test long-term memory on a family trip to my boyhood home, and found no evidence of \\"artistic revision\\" at all.  So it seems to me Sagan improperly generalizes about memory from fringe cases.<br />I also find myself skeptical of the priority of skepticism itself.  \\"Look at all the foolish things people fall for!\\" is the basic argument here, \\"People are so gullible, so willing to believe!\\"  Sagan gives many examples, the point of which is \\"Be skeptical!\\"  Seems a bit like stacking the deck, to me.  What about the harm that comes from an overly-critical view?  What about the admiral who can't believe the Japanese are really attacking, or the parents who refuse to buy their children's story about a trusted uncle?  Two human propensities -- foolish credulity and foolish incredulity -- are both common.  But they cancel one another, and we're left with a problem -- what's the evidence?  Sagan is against one, but hustles us towards the other -- because he buys it himself.  Thus, he writes glibly of hte \\"Copernican Insight\\" and the scientific illiteracy of those who doubt it, even as top-notch astronomers discuss the strong challenge anthropic discoveries seem to pose to that principle.  <br />Most of Sagan's arguments are directed towards the fringe -- alien abductees, satanic abuse -- but he jabs inwards towards \\"mainstream religion\\" with frequency.  Many of these jabs are directed at Christianity, but with only occasional accuracy.  About the witch trials, for example, he overstates the number of victims on the order of 10 to 100, and makes all the old mistakes in linking them closely to The Church that even one fair-minded Wiccan historian has expressed embarrassment about.  I don't think Sagan is being malicious, and often he does get his facts straight.  But he is a professional scientist, and an amateur historian or political scientist.  He simply over-estimates the intellectual magic and breadth of \\"science,\\" and under-estimates the gullibility of his own and other scientific minds.  And he clearly has not read good opposing arguments -- in science, history, or philosophy.  <br />Again, Sagan writes as if Democracy and Science, his favorite values, appeared POOF!  Like a puff of smoke during the Enlightenment.  This is historically naive.  Serious historians have traced the slow growth of free institutions and scientific thought to origins in the Middle Ages and Christian thinking.  (Treadgold, Davies, Dawson, Landes, etc.)  Sagan points out: \\"If we only know our side of the argument, we hardly know that.\\"  Good advice, but when it comes to religion, it is clear he has not taken it.  He seems only to have read very skeptical historians, and not always the best of those.  <br />Sagan encourages scientists to sail out into political waters.  He does not seem to see the danger (obvious to me, having met with many examples) that historically and politically naive scientists will play upon the prestige of their fields to muck in matters of which they know less than they think.  \\"To know what you know, and know what you don't know, this is knowledge,\\" said Confucius.  But Sagan castigates Americans for flunking an adult science test, holding up Japanese and others as models by comparison, apparently not aware that Japanese adults did far worse on the very same test.  He implies the Bible speaks of a flat earth, or the inferiority of blacks.  (It does neither.) Nor, on a more complex topic, do I think any fair historian would agree that Christianity subjugated women.  I have offered an historical argument (in Jesus and the Religions of Man) that, on the contrary, nothing has liberated women more around the world than the teachings and example of Christ.  In the spirit of Sagan's call for criticism, I welcome fair-minded rebuttal.	2002-11-05

This is my first direct aquaintance with Paul Tillich.  I found this book extremely thoughtful and interesting.  It is quite short, just ninety pages or so, but concentrated: on dwarf stars, you get more matter per teaspoon than in a herd of elephants; so here with abstract thought, compressed and weighty compared to more glib discussions.  The book is not hard to read, however.  <br />Tillich argues as follows.  First, he defines religion and \\"quasi-religions\\" such as liberal humanism and Marxism: \\"the state of being grasped by an ultimate concern . . . \\"  He differentiates \\"religions of the spirit,\\" such as original Christianity, Buddhism, and liberalism, from \\"legally organized religions,\\" such as Medieval Catholicism, Islam, and later secular faiths.  He fairly and, I think, accurately differentiates between the kind of discrimination between faiths that follows from an affirmation of the truth of one's own, from various forms of more absolute denial.  He follows this question through Christian history in an interesting way, arguing that the dominant Christian approach is not to absolutely repudiate non-Christian beliefs, as is commonly thought.   \\"They did not reject them unambiguously and of course they did not accept them unambiguously . . . they acknowledged the preparatory character of these religions and tried to show how their inner dynamics\\" should send pagans to Christ.  I have been studying this question for some years, and while I believe in God and the whole nine yards, and I'm not sure exactly what Tillich believed, I think on this point he was quite right, and insightful.  (Like the Church fathers ,I havegone further and suggested in my books -- Jesus and the Religions of Man, True Son of Heaven: How Jesus Fulfills the Chinese Culture -- that God in some way seems to have prepared world cultures for the Gospel.)  Tillich traces the various competing solutions to the question of how Christianity relates to other faiths to modern times, and his own contemporaries.  He offers names, but few details.  <br />Another point that Tillich emphasizes is that \\"religions of the spirit\\" tend to lose their character when they come into contact with more authoritarian beliefs, not so much because they lose the military contest, as that they \\"fight fire with fire,\\" and become too much like their opponents.  His examples here are Islam and Communism.  I think he is right that that is a danger, though I don't think the danger is absolute, or that it may never be necessary in fact to take up arms in defense of a free society.  But he puts the problem well.       <br />In the following chapter, Tillich discusses the encounter between Christianity and Buddhism.  I think he underestimates the success of Christian missions and overestimates the importance of Buddhism to East Asian cultures (on art, for example).  But that is a part of his tendancy to speak in big generalizations.  <br />Tillich closes with a chapter called \\"Christianity judging itself in the light of its encounter with the World Religions.\\"  Here he speaks of Christianity as the \\"negation of religion,\\" and of Christ as a \\"symbol.\\"  He suggests a hope that Christianity will become, rather than an independent, self-enclosed religion, a \\"center of crystallization for all positive religious elements after they have been subjected to the criteria implied in this center.\\"  I agree with the general concept, though I am not sure I agree with what Tillich sees as the \\"center\\" of Christian faith.  (I am also skeptical about the \\"wisdom\\" with which Tillich claims in this chapter that Islam has dealt with \\"primitive peoples.\\"  See V. S. Naiphaul.)  Tillich argues \\"not conversion, but dialogue.\\"  Then on the very last page, when I'm hoping he will explain what he thinks people should base future faith upon, Tillich  peters out into rather confused metaphors about the \\"depths\\" of a religion, a \\"point\\" of time that \\"breaks through (the) particularity\\" of a given religion and \\"elevates\\" it to freedom.  I'm not at all sure what he means by that.  But there are many interesting thoughts in this grand sweep of a little book, and I found it well worth reading.	2002-10-31

Sometimes I feel guilty for not starting at the beginning of a book like this and reading right through. Hayman removes such guilt by the curious expediant of neglecting to put his anecdotes into any coherent form. It hardly seems to matter where you start -- the author seemed to have trouble even putting individual chapters into order. One interesting theme he mentions was how Jung served as a link between pre-modern and post-modern spirituality. Neither this nor other themes were developed. But ultimately I forgave Hayman, mostly, because much of what I found was interesting, despite the mayhem. It is like dropping in on an eccentric friend at irregular and unscheduled intervals: you do get a feel for who the man is, perhaps as much because of as in spite of the disorder. <br />There were times when I found myself wondering, \\"Why did this guy write a book about a person for whom he seems to have so little respect?\\" (Being, apparently, rather skeptical of the occult side of Jung.) But in other scenes, Jung comes across as sane and sensible, and his insights perhaps of value.  The author doesn't explain those insights in way that makes it very clear to me, but of course Jung can speak for himself on that.  At one point, what appeared psychobabble -- or at least esoteria -- to an outsider like myself, flew thick and fast between Jung, Freud, wives, and girlfriends. The author tells us what the persons involved \\"really\\" had in mind. \\"What happened was they had unconsciously 'swallowed' part of one another's soul.\\" Hmmmn. At times like that, the author comes across like the friend who was supposed to stay sober at the party, but took a few sips anyway. <br />Overall, I found much fault with this book, but interesting tidbits, and kept picking it up, till I read it through. There's some interesting stuff on Freud and other early psychological persons, as well.  I am still not quite sure what to make of Jung's theories -- and have some theories of my own by which to consider them -- but Hayman has, at least, helped me to put those ideas in rough, if not entirely coherent, context.  And I enjoyed the book.  ...	2002-10-17

I enjoyed the mixture of fast-paced narrative and paranoid vision of American decline.  Crichton is intelligent and a good story-teller.  But I wouldn't read it twice, as I with a really compelling story.     <br />A haunting tale can be built upon a vision of pure paranoia, as George Orwell showed in 1984.  When we open a novel, we are entering an imaginary world, or at least the world as the author sees it in some mood, so it does not do to be too thin-skinned.  (As some below appear.  Literature must come from honest private impression, not the censored version of reality that is public convention.)  But in the best anti-utopian stories, the sermon is imbedded in the tale, and then explained by the narrator (That Hideous Strength) or some guru-like wise man (the Fishburne character in Matrix) or villain (O'brien in 1984, the cave-dweller in Well's Time Machine, )late in the story.  You feel the creapiness of the place before anyone explains it to you, and the impression it leaves comes from the images, in which exposition clothes itself.     <br />Crichton is an overly intrusive author.  His sermons about the danger of aggressive Japanese business practice and empty American self-confidence pop up so often they impede rather than add flavour to the story; I found myself skipping them.  Crichton doesn't give his characters enough life of their own: they all puppet the party line.  C. S. Lewis said of George MacDonald that his novels contained many sermons, and this was a relief because he was a poor novelist, but an excellent preacher.  Michael Crichton, by contrast, writes an exciting story, but his preaching tends to be over-wrought.  And why do nearly all his characters, professional or blue collar, male or female, swear like staff sargeants?  Enough, already.  Most people I know can get through a whole day without four-letter words, let alone a sentence.<br />As an American who lives inJapan, I think some of Crichton's points are merited -- Americans, by contrast to Japanese, can be yacky and whiny, we have too many lawyers, and service is not nearly as good.  Much of what he says about the Japanese rings true as well; I'm not totally averse to a little Japan-bashing.  On the other hand, Crichton's Japan guru, Conner, says some things that made him seem considerably less wise in my eyes.  Japanese have \\"never been guilty or embarrassed about sex.\\"  Nonsense.  He must be reading too much James Clavell.  They \\"have no problem with homosexuality.\\"  Get real.

When I read books on subjects I am not very familiar with, such as subatomic physics, I tend to access the reliability of the author by his accuracy on subjects I know more about.  That's one reason I wasn't able to work up much confidence in Goswami's physics.  He throws out too many low-wattage ideas on language, philosophy and history that distract me.  <br />To begin with, he uses \\"paradox\\" as a synonym for \\"self-contradiction.\\"    <br />According to Goswami, religions are all founded by mystics who believe in monism, a trancendant Brahma, divine play, the whole Upanishadic kit and kaboodle.  Later, disciples dumb the \\"real teachings\\" of the Master down for the masses.  This is doubtful historically in almost every actual case of which I am aware -- and I study the origins of religions for a living.  In the case of Jesus, still less Mohammed, only massive falsification or at least wishful thinking can save the paradigm.  I realize this idea is not original with Goswami.  But I am a little tired of people making a case for monism from the NT by quoting a few teachings that seem to agree with it out of context, and ignoring the rest.  <br />As for philosophy, Goswami's ideas about love seem shallower than those of theistic thinkers like C. S. Lewis, Lin Yutang, or even Scott Peck, to me.  He thinks love is best when based upon the premise of monism.  \\"How can you not love when there is one consciousness and you known that you and the other are not really separate?\\"  A silly question; there are categories of neurosis that work precisely that way.  On a philosophical level, the question is meaningless.  On a historical level, if monism is the True Path to love, and if the culture that has embraced monism the most enthusiastically is India, then why did it take a foreign religion (guess which one) to challenge the cruel and inhuman institutions of caste, widow-burning and confinement, human sacrifice, etc?  (See J.N. Farquhar, Crown of Hinduism; Vishal Mangalwadi.) Given that history, it is a bit bizarre for a Hindu to accuse Christians of a \\"world-negating\\" faith.  <br />Again, \\"If we could single out one historical concept that has propelled humans and their societies towards much violence and warfare, it is the concept of hierarchy.\\"  This kind of statement may sound good to many readers, but it strikes me as facile and historically incomplete.  (Though his idea of \\"tangled hierarchy\\" is interesting.) Actually, some of the bloodiest movements, like early Islam and Marxism, have preached radical equality.  And the Sisters of Charity are hierarchical, I believe.  Goswami makes sweeping historical generalizations that sound good, but it seems a hit-or-miss proposition whether they are in fact true.  <br />I am less qualified to debate Goswami's science.  I assume he's getting his basic facts right, and don't see any too obvious errors in that regard.  But another way to access a writer on unfamiliar topics, is to see how he engages opposing points of view.  Those who know more about physics than I do (I'm thinking of John Polkinghorne for one) have objected to the interpretation of quantum facts Goswami offers.  It doesn't appear to me that Goswami really engages such views well.  <br />Back to philosophy, when Goswami argues that, given the facts of physics, Descarte's famous statement should be re-written as, \\"I choose, therefore I am,\\" an alternative phrasing, \\"God choses, therefore I am,\\" seems to me equally valid, on Goswami's premises.  Why prefer his interpretation?  He offers no good reason.  It appears he hasn't really thought the question through from anyone else's point of view but his own.  <br />The diagrams are good; the writing clear and colloquial, the subject interesting.  I think the best thing Goswami could do would be to read a lot of good books he doesn't agree with.  The book would be more interesting to me were it part of a dialogue, rather than a monologue by Schrodinger's cat alone a box.  But maybe that's one of the dangers of monism.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2002-10-07

And the breadth of knowledge he brings to the discussion is often impressive.  But he ultimately gives what seems to me not only a largely mistaken, but a shallow and even childish reading of history.  <br />Politically, Said frankly lets us know where his sympathies lie, and where they do not lie.  He seldom misses a chance to make a snide remark about American \\"Captain Ahab\\" adventures against foreign dictators.  Desert Storm was \\"an imperial war against the Iraqi people.\\"  America fights such wars to put \\"lesser peoples, with lesser rights, morals, claims\\" in their places.  Americans \\"love to think that whatever it wanted was just what the human race wanted.\\"  Said probably changed the channel when he saw Kabul residents cheering American intervention.  While he qualifies his theories on details, one of his chief faults is to look the other way when evidence disconfirms them in big ways.  <br />Said sees himself as fighting a lonely battle.  He feels \\"outnumbered and outorganized,\\" with all the wealthy universities and media outlets taking up \\"a strident chorus of right-wing tending damnation, in which they separate what is non-white, non-Western, and non-judeo-Christian from the acceptable.\\"  Anyone who reads the Western press as a vast, right-wing conspiracy may appreciate such jeremiads.  The rest of us an only stare in awe.  <br />Human beings are not angels, and Western history is certainly not all crumpets and tea.  It is legitimate, though a bit late, to attack Western colonialism, and express disgust at pretensions that Great Powers acted solely for the benefit of those they conquered.  <br />Said exagerates without shame or limit, however.  \\"No one with any power to influence public discussion on policy demurred as to the basic superiority of the white European male, who should always retain the upper hand.\\"  This comes shortly after Said condemns Kipling (and Europeans) for over-generalizing about Indian character.  And it is bunk.  Loyalties of the 19th Century were not so neatly divided.  There were public figures whose first loyalties were not to their own state, nor even to native peoples, but to God, for example.  Christian leaders and thinkers like Wesley, Wilberforce, Booth, Carey, Farquhar, and WAP Martin often said and did all that should have been said and done, somestimes better than any armchair Marxist alive now does.  In his deathbed letter to Wilberforce, John Wesley contrasted \\"civil, reasonable, industrious\\" Africans, with \\"villainous\\" slavetraders in a way that would make a modern liberal feel sorry for the slavetraders.  (\\"Are you a man?  Then you should have a human heart.  The Great God will deal with you as you have dealt with them!\\")  Indian writer Mangalwadi notes that Wilberforce never seemed to act in England's best economic interests.  Wesley and Wilberforce were two of the most influential men who ever lived.  <br />The truth is, the period Said covers involved a long, complex battle for the soul of Western culture.  Commercial self-interest usually had the upper hand, but within nominally Christian empires, the teachings of Jesus slowly conquered self-interest in many cases to bring reform, as Mangalwadi and Farquhar have described in India.  Crusaders Against Opium tells a similiar story of how some Westerners (missionaries) unanimously fought against England's obvious commercial interests in China as well.<br />But Said, being influenced by Matthew Arnold, looks for \\"sweatness and light\\" in the world of letters, rather than among the followers of the light that really did make a difference.  Said implies feminism sprang up in non-Western cultures out of thin air.  The great Chinese skeptic, Hu Shi, said however, that missionaries \\"taught us to look at women as people.\\"  It was missionaries again who fought the first and most important battles for the elevation of women in India, China, and Japan.  While Said's \\"leading lights\\" of Western civilization were piddling around on the margins, these people not only conceived of the \\"natives\\" taking charge, they empowered them to do so, sometimes at the cost of their lives.  Said almost ignores these people, for the health of his theory.  In general, Said reveals a naive and rather petulant understanding of human nature, (as opposed to really illuminating social critics like Solzhenitsyn and Rene Girard) and overlooks the true source of the light that brings liberation.  <br />The book could also be better written.  \\"Conrad's way of demonstrating this discrepancy between the orthodox and his own views of empire is to keep drawing attention to how ideas and values are constructed (and deconstructed) through dislocations in the narrator's language.\\"  This, from a fan of George Orwell?<br />...	2002-10-04

History is told twice, it is said: as history, and as farce.  This is the revised version of the Mike Warnke story.  Trout and Hertenstein unravel the untrue tale of Warnke thread by thread: fake ex-Satan worshipper, womanizer, whiner, con, and man whose gift of gad is always welcome in a dumbed-down, feeling-over-fact church.  They do so not to gloat, farcical as events may sometimes seem, but with openness and I think compassion as well as sorrow.  Their goal is to wake the church up to the importance of telling the truth.  <br />The story is not only well-told, but carefully told.  The secondary heroes of the tale are, inescapably, the intrepid investigators, but the primary hero is Truth, with a capital T, and with personal names whose initials are J.C.  <br />It has been said that in ancient Rome, commoners saw all religions as equally true, philosophers saw them as equally false, and politicians saw them as equally useful.  The reviewer below who criticizes a book she has not read because Warnke wins people to Christ must take a very pragmatic view of things.  Does the God who created the galaxies need to run scams to get people to believe in Him?  Can we, by telling lies, convert people to the Truth?  Mike Warnke's story is taudry and sad, but by telling it, and by telling it well, with thorough research, good writing, and honest introversion, the authors give us an important wake-up call...And while we do, take heed lest we fall as well.	2002-10-04

Curtis Chang has an excellent idea: read Augustine and Aquinas, two great Christian thinkers, compare how they explained their faith to non-Christian contemporaries of their eras, and see what we in the \\"post-modern\\" world can learn.  Overall, I think he pulls it off well.  Chang is a thoughtful writer, and the book is well-organized and clearly (though not eloquently) written. (Chang seems to be one of those writers whose diction remains structured and careful even when he  gets a bit passionate.)  <br />I was happy to learn a bit about Aquinas (whom I had not read) and to bask in Chang's exposition of one aspect of the thought of Augustine (whom I have long appreciated).  He argues that the two men entered into the stories of their non-Christian opponents, deepened them, and retold them as facets of the \\"metanarrative\\" of the Gospel.  This subject particularly interests me because I am doing research on the fascinating (and long) story of how Western, Indian and Chinese Christians have related the Gospel to their cultures.  Also, I wrote a book a couple years ago, Jesus and the Religions of Man, that relates the Gospel to modern religions and ideologies in a way rather similar to Augustine's approach in City of God -- maybe more by accident than by design.  I think the period in which Augustine wrote resembled our own diverse, multi-cultural society in many ways, and we have much to learn from him.  (And, it seems, from Aquinas as well.) <br />I also learned a bit about \\"post-modernism\\" here, at last.  (The term being unnecessarily ugly, I have previously tried to avoid finding out what it referred to.  Ignore it, and it will go away!)  I don't think, as one reviewer below seems to, that Chang accepts the \\"post-modern\\" view wholeheartedly, nor ask us to.  \\"Both (A+A) . . . enter the pagan and Islamic stories still retaining their distinctive Christian identities.  They refuse to give in to some confusing syncretism or an intellectual appeasement that would changethe essence of the gospel.\\"  I don't think Chang is unconcerned about truth, just because he emphasizes story.  (Which he calls \\"narrative,\\" yikes.) Story and truth need not conflict.  The Gospel marks where the two cross and become one.  Chang's approach is to find truth in non-Christian philosophy, and show how the Gospel deepens and supplements it.  I think that is a valid, Biblical, and rational approach to any worldview that contains truth, as  \\"post-modernism\\" undoubtedly does.  <br />Chang talks about Islam in an indirect way, because he thinks Aquinas wrote Summa Contra Gentiles to help missionaries reach the educated, philosophical Muslims of his day.  Islam is of course on a lot of peoples' minds, my own included.  I think Chang is a bit hard on the Crusaders -- it would only be fair for us to enter their story, too, if we are going to enter that of the Muslims.  Not everyone has the luxury of responding to armies with words alone.  And I am not sure Aquinas was always entirely tolerant either.	2002-09-28

Coming of Age in Samoa is a pleasantly-written South Sea fantasy, heavy with the author's social agenda upon it.  If you buy the agenda, apparently you can hardly help like the book.  (See reviews below.)  Even if I bought the agenda (and it is hard for me to look at American society and say the sexuality Mead encouraged has made people entirely free of guilt or conflict), I would still choke on her dishonesty.  But as they say in the anthro business, different strokes for different folks.  <br />Some of the defenses of this book below are hilarious.  \\"Sure, it's largely untrue.  But it reads well!\\" (And here I thought it was supposed to be science.) \\"It stimulated my thinking about culture!  Mead really did interview thirty live Samoans!  (In some language or other.) \\"Besides, what scholarship from that era would not sound like fiction today?\\"  (Uh, honest scholarship?  Do you want a book list?)<br />The interesting thing about this book, to me, is the way it illustrates human self-deception, in particular the hubris of those who claim to speak for \\"Science.\\"  Being interested in such curiosities, for me personally the book was worth buying.  Mead's sexual fantasies are not the only instance in the 20th Century in which anthropologists sought to throw out \\"religious dogma\\" in favor of \\"scientific\\" new theories of their own cultivation.  As pleasant as an idyllic trip to the islands may be, those for whom such theories hold charm should remember that honest scholarship and imagination are two different things, that vacations in Fantasy Island usually cost something, and that the one who takes the vacation is not always the person who pays the bill.	2002-09-26

Light in the Shadow of Jihad is eloquent and seemingly heart-felt sermon, but a little short on substance, it seemed to me.  Zacharius' main points are that relativism is unhelpful in meeting the needs of modern man, and unprincipled absolutism -- a la bin Laden -- is no good either.  It's also kind of a patriotic crie de couer.  All right.  Rousing, but not that enlightening.  But maybe that's because I've heard the sermon before.    <br />I tend to agree with most of what Zacharius says.  But from the title I thought I might learn something about Islam here.  I did not.  The book is primarily about relativism.  Zacharius is from India, but he seems to know more about Western philosophy than about non-Western religions, which is a pity, because Americans do need to learn about other religions from a prophetic, rather than uncritically affirming or denying, perspective.  If that is what you are looking for, I recommend Paul Fregosi (Jihad), Maxime Rodinson (Mohammed), Bernard Lewis, V.S. Naipaul, or Peter Partner (God of Battles) for an honest and more informed look at Islam.  I also highly recommend the works of Vishal Mangalwadi, another Indian Christian who writes with passion, but also it seems to me broader knowledge of other religions.  If you want an eloquent sermon on the errors of relativism, this book may meet your need, however.	2002-09-22

John Grisham does not have a reputation for being a great artist, but I thought he did well in this book in going beyond simple villainy and heroics.  There are no real bad guys in The Testament -- just people like you and I, who are overcome by their passions.  Resembling great writers in this respect at least, Grisham picks up a mirror and shows us ourselves, using the story to examine the nature of good and evil.  This is a relief from a lot of modern story-telling, which would be embarrassed to admit any such bourgeois categories, or that heroism does not need a touch of the power of the Dark Side to be truly effective.  <br />Grisham's missionary hero in this book has been criticized as too good, but I recognized real female missionaries I have met in his portrait of Rachel (see The Inn of the Seventh Happiness, To a Different Drum, or Goforth of China, for real-life examples).  Anyway, what is wrong with taking as your heroine a person who is not only strong (like Dirty Harry or Arnold Schwarzeneggar, who do not resemble anyone I have met) but also a really caring and virtuous person?  <br />But Grisham's stories are primarily driven by plot, (he hasn't turned into Dostoevsky, don't worry) and the plot here is a doozy.  I planned to read a chapter or two a night, but scrapped that idea half way through the book.  All in all, I enjoyed the book very much.

This book is a well-written, fairly well-researched, and careful argument that, far from doing great harm, the Gospel has done the human race a lot of good.  No, the Nazis were not Christians: in fact many Christians played a very honorable role in opposing them, they show.  It is not a coincidence, they maintain, that modern science, democracy ,and the end of slavery began in Christian countries: there are connections.  <br />One reviewer below accuses the authors of constructing a straw man argument.  What planet is he living on?  At the head of each chapter the authors briefly summarize a common charge against Christianity, then develop it a bit before bringing contrary evidence.  I've heard all the charges, many times.  The reviewer thinks that the \\"real point\\" is that \\"the Christian Right are repugnant to thoughtful people\\" because they \\"champion prejudice and intolerance\\" bomb abortion clinics, and so on.  But the authors readily and repeatedly admit that some Christians get carried away in zeal or forget their own beliefs in the heat of passion.  And in the case of abortion, right or wrong, Christians see themselves as protecting those who cannot protect themselves -- the ultimate underdogs.  Right or wrong, that is hardly \\"selfishness.\\"  So who is attacking a straw man?   <br />The critic makes two good points, though.  First, the authors do appear ignorant of other religious traditions.  They mostly focus on Europe and the Americas.  It was gauling to me that most their (passing) references to the Chinese tradition were negative.  A fuller view would take more into account the accomplishments of other traditions.  Such an argument would only be stronger, because it would also take account of the enormous contributions of the Gospel to Asian cultures.  (See my Jesus and the Religions of Man, also books by Vishal Mangalwadi and J.N. Farquhar.  While I'm recommending authors who have interesting things to say on this topic, also check out Rene Girard -- the Scapegoat.)    <br />The critic is also right in implying that a \\"raw raw\\" argument can be spiritually dangerous.  \\"My\\" faith can easily become an ego attachment, encouraging complacency, superiority, or a defensive attitude.  The facts here are true, and therefore ought to be better known, and taken into account.  (And the quality of the book is good enough that you may feel comfortable giving a copy to your most educated cynical friend.) But the danger of pride does lurk in focusing on such facts, if done with the wrong attitude.  What the authors describe here (I remind myself) is not what \\"my\\" faith has done, but the work of the Lord: examples for meditation and emulation, in a world still in need of God's love.  Hebrews 12:1 could profitably be printed on the back cover:  \\"Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us set aside every encumbrance, and the sin that so easily besets us, and run the race that is set before us.\\"	2002-06-02

The reviewer below gives a pretty good summary of the book's contents, so I'll just add my two bits about its quality.  C&WT is well-done, balanced, and readable.  The author relates the ideas of leading Christian and non-Christian thinkers in a clear style, interjecting his own thoughtful viewpoint with about the right frequency.  He treats readers with respect, but has mercy on those of us who find a lot of philosophical discourse a bit esoteric by explaining terms and concepts.  None of the book is boring, (to me) because Brown engages his subjects with respect and interest -- this is not an archeological dig in quaint DWM thought.  Nor is the book a long editorial.  When the author gives his opinion, he sets it clearly apart, and it is cogent and reasonable.  Brown not only shows the awesome breadth of knowledge that such an undertaking requires -- charting the ideas of great and famous thinkers from 500 B. C. to 1800 in a single complex story -- he also demonstrates good taste and judgement in dealing with thinkers of such widely differing views and personalities.  I appreciated, for example, his rehabilitation of Descartes, the brackets he puts around Hume, his discussion of Pascal, and so on.  It seems to me he deals with them all pretty fairly, though of course this book is no substitute for the originals.  I hope volume II is as good. <br />It would be unfair to complain that the book is too narrow in scope.  But it may encourage an attitude among Western Christians that I think is.  Brown seems to envision \\"the West\\" almost hermetically sealed fomm the rest of the world.  (As do so many Christians.)  For instance, Brown seems to go along with the convention that the Greeks started philosophy too readily.  But weren't the Pythagoreans roughly a school of Advetic thought beamed over from India?  And don't the Vedas, the Hundred Schools of Zhou-era China, and so on, also have claims to originating philosophy?  Or more pertinently -- how about the Wisdomm literature of the Old Testament?  What is needed now that Christianity is no longer primarily a Western religion is to connect Christian thought to its roots in world rather than Western (Greek) tradition alone.

Lewis understands Middle Eastern cultures thoroughly, he expresses his ideas clearly, and (it seems to me) is commmitted to telling the truth, honestly and fairly.  <br />Islam and the West is, of course, a broad topic, and the book is only 200 pages, with some repetition from other works, I think, so I was sometimes disappointed in Lewis' choice of topics.  The book is primarily a history of intellectual understandings, and secondarily a reply to Said's attacks.  It is not a political history of the two civilizations, though it gives a bit of that history.  (Paul Fregosi's Jihad is the most enlightening book I've read on the military aspect of the relationship.)  Lewis shows how the West became interested in Islam from the Middle Ages, and how Islam much later developed an interest in the other direction.  He discusses Gibbon, colonialism, Islamic factions, and how Christians, Jews, and Muslims have seen one another.  He also offers an eloquent appeal for honest and free historical study of other cultures.  As a student of Asian cultures, I appreciated the way he emphasizes the need to understand other worldviews as they understand themselves, rather than projecting our categories  onto them.  His tone is sometimes ironic, but not, in my opinion, indulgently so.  Said mostly deserves the drubbing (verbal smart bombs) he takes, though Lewis may be a touch thorough.  (But with less collatoral damage than Said's sweeping invective.)<br />Lewis asks why Westerners have studied other cultures, and gives several answers (beyond the power grab Said suggests): spiritual links to the Middle East, fear of jihad, the prestige of Arab science.  <br />I would add another.  It seems to me Dr. Lewis is weakest when he talks about Christianity.  He assumes that Christianity claims exclusive truth in the same sense as Islam.  But a further reason that the West studied Islam I think derives from differences between the two faiths.  Missionaries like Matteo Ricci and James Legge were often at the forefront of Western understanding of Asian cultures, and even today Christian missionaries translate the Bible into thousands of remote languages.  I think this has to do with the Christian idea of the \\"word become flesh.\\"  In Christianity, God affirmed other cultures and languages by the incarnation, and underlined it with the miracle of Pentacost.  This is quite different from the Muslim idea of the Koran writen in heaven in \\"pure Arabic,\\" which can never be translated, and made a huge difference in the thought of people like Justin, Origin, Augustine, and Ricci.  <br />Lewis misunderstands why Christians reject Mohammed, I think.  The difference between the two faiths, and the reason Christians mistrust Mohammed, is not just that one is earlier and one is later.  Rather, we feel that Mohammed conforms to a type familiar in our scriptures, the \\"false prophet\\" or \\"anti-Christ:\\" the union of unscrupulous power with pretensions to divine authority.  Lewis does Islam and Christianity the courtesy of taking both seriously, however, and that is enormously refreshing.	2002-05-09

This book is a bit like a Who-Done-It written by a writer with novelistic pretensions, in which the author abandons the plot in the events and scenes leading up to the murder.  A lot of this short book is spent describing the cultural evolution of Muslim society in response to Western hegemony, down to such details as sports and time pieces.  The details are often worth reading, and Dr. Lewis does tie things together in the end a bit.  In the last chapter Ace Detective Lewis sorts through the various suspects and clues (the history he has been giving) to bring closure and lay blame -- a little vaguely, however.  Along the way Lewis has some worthwhile insights, for example, his idea of \\"harmonization\\" as the key to Western culture.  (One of the values of learning about another culture is what you learn about your own in the process.) Worth reading, but not quite what I expected from the title.<br />My prior impression was Lewis was supposed to be hard on Islam.  But it is hard to see why any reasonable person would object to this book on that ground.  He claims Medieval Islam offered \\"vastly more freedom\\" than its competitors, at least for the male, Muslim, and free minority.  (A completely different verdict from that of Donald Treadgold in Freedom, a History.)  Lewis also claims Islam didn't have \\"wars of religion\\" like the West.  Does that mean he defines Muslim civil wars, Shiite-Sunni conflicts, slave-raiding and invading, as non-religious?  It seems to me Lewis bends over backwards to be fair to Muslim civilization.  (Though he shows less patience for modern lunatics.) Overall, his approach struck me as moderate, honest, and well-considered.  He made me think a bit better of Islam than I had previously.<br />What went wrong?  Not only does the question not get answered well, as some reviewers note, I am not even sure it got thoroughly asked.  Lewis claims it would be \\"implausible\\" to blame Islam itself, considering how successful the Muslim civilization was for so long.  But it seems to me that is because he defines \\"the problem\\" as the relative weakening of Muslim culture.  After reading Paul Fregosi's Jihad, a swash-buckling and romantic (but historical) record of Muslim attacks on Europe, it seems to me Lewis defines the problem too narrowly.  Neighboring peoples might be forgiven for thinking there was already a problem before Islam began to go into relative decline, and that the decline was a partial solution to it.  The seclusion of women and the thousand-year jihad that swallowed Persia, Babylon, Nubia, India, Byzantine and a fair chunk of Europe was \\"wrong,\\" too, wasn't it?  Broaden Lewis' question to that extent, however, and it might appear that what went wrong in the first place was, to put it crudely, Mohammed.  Lewis, while too honest to be politically correct, does not however seem ready, in this book at least, to consider that answer.  But until Muslims renounce Mohammed's idea that believers have a God-given right to slaughter infidels and treat women like loot, a renewed Islamic civilization is not something that I, personally, am going to pray for.<br />Lewis touches briefly on the correlary to his title question, what can set things right in the Muslim world.  Perhaps healing might come (for us as for them) from listening more faithfully to a different Muslim prophet -- the one who, in the third century of Islam, was apocryphally quoted as saying: \\"If you desire to devote yourself entirely to God . . . Forgive those who have done you evil . . . Be kind to those who have been unkind to you.\\"  What was his name?  Oh, yes -- Jesus.for so long.

This story about a burnt-out pastor in a small farming town in Eastern Washington was the best I've read of Peretti.  He does a good job of evoking the quality of every day life in the early, \\"slow\\" parts of the book.  (I liked them the best.) He also comes close (close the shutters, put the pastor on hold) to telling the truth about church.  Evangelicals feel his heat at times: \\"God was expected to follow the printed order of service and keep quiet like everyone else.\\"  But most of his jabs come at the expense of his own, Pentacostal, wing of the church: \\"Nobody has ever taken a town for Jesus.  Not even Jesus ever took a town for Jesus.\\"  Peretti might get a job as a professional skeptic, with his mad-cap (but oh so familiar) send-up of the up-tight church in Rainier valley and of the \\"Cathedral of Life.\\"  Yet he also tells the other truth (turn out the lights) that (shhhh) God actually does answer prayer sometimes.  It's not always easy to hold two conflicting truths in one's mind at the same time, and do justice to both, but Peretti manages to be pretty real in this book.<br />The story threatens to slide into farce at one or two points.  Seventeen people die in a fireball, paranthetically.  Instead of helping the wounded, the hero and his friends run off to dig up the grave of someone who died months ago.  With hints of Voltairian absurdity, Stephen King demons, and the judgement scene from That Hideous Strength, the book threatens to go over the top, and lose the credibility it built in the early going.  But in the end, it comes down as a pretty well-told and emotionally believable story.<br />In some ways the book might even be read as a theory of (false) Messianic religion.  The anti-hero's personality reminds me in some ways of revolutionary founders like Mohammed, Hong Xiuquan, and Marx, and some Indian gurus.  The Bagwan Rajneesh, whose utopian commune was just one state down, same side of the Cascades, especially resembles these remarks.  The demon theory does not seem all that outlandish to me, in some of those cases.  But Peretti does a better job here than in his first books of keeping the focus on man and God, and that's a healthy switch.<br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Manheory does not seem all that outlandish to me, in some of those cases.

Several weeks ago I stood on the site of the palace of Hong Xiuquan, the moderately mad school-teacher who attempted to fuse Christian, Confucian, and Chinese folk ideals to overthrow the Qing Dynasty a hundred fifty years ago.  To the right of the replica of Hong's old reading desk were written, in beautiful script, these words: \\"The tiger runs a thousand li and returns to the land of the swallow,\\" and on the left, \\"The dragon flies to the ninth heaven and revives the dynasty of Yao and Xun.\\"  (Ideal ancient eemperors like Kings David or Arthur.) Clearly Hong saw the Biblical God not as doing away with Chinese ideals, but as bringing them to fruition.  <br />The desire to reconcile the \\"need for roots\\" (as Simone Weil put it) with truth that is universal, is one of the key problems of modern life.  James Legge, one of the greatest China scholars, believed Jesus could be the bridge between East and West.  <br />This book is interesting for several reasons.  The cousin of Hong Xiuquan, Hong Rengan, was a friend of James Legge.  When Hong was named (nominal) head of the rebel government, he laid plans for sweeping reform of Chinese society to make it both a modern, prosperous state -- and the land of the sparrow, a China, like that of Yao and Xun, under the rule of Heaven.  <br />Aside from the small role Legge played in Chinese history, he knew ancient Chinese thought remarkably well.  His translations of ancient Confucian and Taoist texts are a century and a half old now, but several are still standard works.  While some scholars dislike his faith, or complain of his less than eloquent style, even one fan of the Book of Changes admits his translations are \\"never wrong.\\"  He was a precise scholar with a remarkable grasp of Chinese thought.  Legge was also honest as a winter rain in Scotland.  His clear, meat-and-potatoes (or dumpling and soy sauce) approach remains a pretty good introduction to Chinese religions.  (Apart from folk religion.)  <br />In this book, Legge describes the two \\"native\\" faiths of China, and gives his thoughts on the relationship between Christianity and Chinese culture.  Like Matteo Ricci, he is less familiar with, and sympathetic towards, the Buddhist tradition.  He doesn't care for folk Taoism either, though he appeciates the Dad Dejing some.  Recently, a Chinese philosopher has called Lao Zi a \\"prophet of God\\" who foretold the coming of Christ.  Legge is too cautious for that.  But he does say, \\"The more that a man possesses the Christian spirit, the more anxious will he be to do justice to every other system of religion,\\" and he tries to be fair.  <br />Like Ricci, Hong, and even the great Kang Xi emperor, Legge believes the ancient Chinese worshipped the same God as He whom Christians pray to.  For Legge, too, acceptance of the Gospel would not mean rejecting ancient Chinese culture, but affirming its highest ideals -- including worship of the God that Yao and Shun believed in.  <br />Legge was born before the concept of being \\"politically correct\\" occured to most Europeans, and it shows.  He does not much care for Buddhism.  (It was rather corrupt in his day.) He argues, in his straightforward but undiplomatic way, that Christianity is \\"superior\\" to even the best teachings of traditional Chinese culture.  I prefer to describe the relationship in terms of completion, rather than comparison.  (True Son of Heaven: How Jesus Fulfills the Chinese Culture.)  But even some secular Chinese historians admit that missionaries of Legge's era did  (in imitation of Jesus) an enormous amount of good in China, in education, medicine, raising the status of women.  How could they have brought reform if they didn't have what they thought a worthy form on whom to model progress?  <br />Anyway, Legge found great delight in Chinese culture.  He certainly earned a right to his opinions.  For anyone interested in China, Christianity, or comparative religion, this old book is worth tracking down.  <br />Author, Jesus andthe Religions of Man	2002-04-21

Voltaire has here written a gem of a story from the unpromising material of cynicism and farce.  Don't try this at home -- apart from genius,  it will fall flat -- but Candide ripples with wit.       <br />Leibnetz, it is true, is hardly a household name today.  But I expect Candide was also meant to be a sword-thrust into the soft underbelly of theism, the \\"Problem of Pain.\\"  While orthodox Christians do not claim this to be the \\"best of all possible worlds\\" (rather, a fallen one), the chaotic and apparently senseless troubles in it seem to a lot of us, too, to be the best argument against our faith.  Voltaire twists the knife well.  I was glad to see that though he excels, and delights, in mockery, the story functions ultimately as what may be an honest question, like that of Job or of Solomon.  (In fact, ironically, the book Candide most reminds me of is Ecclesiastes.)       <br />In one regard, at least, Candide is less true to life than the Biblical point of view, however.  Thousands die here, but no one is begotten.  The insanity of life is celebrated to the full, but its beauty and wonder are not squarely faced.  The one-sidedness of Voltaire's approach lessens it as a work of philosophy, in my opinion.  I couldn't help but reflect that many in the 20th Century went into the hell-holes of communist prisons, where every horror Candide and his friends experienced occurred, and more (the atheists of the 20th Century were also, in their own ways, ingenious), yet emerged with a strong belief in God.  (Even some, like Solzhenitsyn, who went in as atheists.)  Why is that?  Philosophy, it seems to me, needs to face all sides of a question.  This Voltaire hardly pretends to do: the book is a question, not an answer.  But as satire on premature answers, it sizzles.    <br />If all Voltaire's books contain cannabalism, libel, bestiality, and philosophical arguments based on slapstick humor, I can hardly blame the authoritiesfor burning them.  Being something of a Puritan myself, I docked Voltaire a star.  Let that be a lesson.      <br />The introduction by Andre Maurois is excellent.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2002-04-02

Later I read some of the Three Musketeers, was bored, and thought maybe Dumas had been a taste of adolescence.  But the second time around, I found this story still a great read.  Monte Cristo is not a study in psychology or culture: it is an amusement park ride before Disney, an Indiana Jones film in ink: a heck of a way to spend a rainy afternoon.  (And make sure your plans for the evening are flexible.)    <br />The version I bought, Bantom, was too skinny, however. (Thus the missing star, also for typos.)  Life is too short to read half of a masterpiece.  Subvert the culture of instant gratification, and buy the unabridged version.

The first time I read this book, many years ago, I was bothered by what I took as Lewis' disrespectful approach to the OT.  One chapter of the book is called \\"Cursings,\\" and in it Lewis forthrightly notes his initial impression that \\"the Jews are much more vindictive and vitriolic than the Pagans.\\"  While he finds something of great value (even refreshing) in their honest anger at injustice, (see Rene Girard's The Scapegoat for a fascinating perspective on violence and religion) some passages he still labels \\"diabolical.\\"   In the following chapter, \\"Death in the Psalms,\\" Lewis frankly admits that most of the psalmists did not appear to know about heaven and hell.  And in his chapter on \\"Scripture,\\" he admits to the presence of \\"naivite, error, contradiction, even wickedness,\\" in the OT.  <br />I did not like this.  Nor did I know enough about nature poetry and paganism, monotheism in other cultures, or Meditteranean cultures, to appreciate all his insights.  <br />What I think I did appreciate, and still do, was the way in which Lewis explains the poetry of the Psalms, the \\"beauty of the Law,\\" (as in Psalm 119), love of nature, \\"second meanings\\" in the Psalms, and most of all, the life-enhancing chapter called \\"A Word about Praising.\\"  John Piper developed this chapter into a whole theology.  (See Confessions of a Christian Hedonist.)  But the most poetic explanation lies here:  \\"I had never noticed that all enjoyment spontaneously overflows into praise . . . I had not noticed how the humblest, and at the same time the most balanced and capacious, minds, praised most, while cranks, misfits and malconents praised least . . . Praise almost seems to be inner health made audible . . . The Psalmists in telling everyone to praise God are doing what all men do when they speak of what they care about.\\"  <br />That chapter is one of the most enlightening and enchanting (in the literal sense) series of marks that have ever been made on paper, I think.  Lewis works a powerfulcounter-spell to the curse of the reductionists, whom he soundly defeats in argument, re-enchanting the world with the glory of God.  I see Lewis' idea confirmed every day -- when my children call me to see a funny scene in a cartoon, or a beautiful sea shell on the beach, for example.<br />What I found on my first reading of this book remains with me, and grows as I learn more of life.  I've also come to appreciate Lewis' take on Scripture, though I am not sure he is completely right.  Lewis differs from both skeptic and inerracist in that he makes no a priori assumptions, either that there are no mistakes in Scripture, or that God cannot do miracles.  This allows him to be frank and take a truly empirical approach.  His conclusion is that the Bible is inspired not like the Koran is said to be, written word-for-word in heaven before time began, but as \\"the same sort of material as any other literature . . . taken into the service of God's word.\\"  Those who see only a human literature are like illiterates who see only ink blots on paper, and are unable to see a poem.  Lewis also hints that the best pagan philosophy and poetry can be \\"taken up\\" into God's revelation in a similar, though less authoritative, manner.  <br />If all that gives you the impression that Lewis covers a lot of territory, with little detailed discussion of most individual psalms, that's true.<br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2002-03-27

Rene Girard proposes to change how we think about religion and history. To do so, he takes us through history, mythology, and the New Testament, pointing out facts we may not have noticed about group violence and how it justifies itself, and the way Jesus \\"subverts the dominant paradigm,\\" as they say.  Like a geologist pointing to a piece of land we have walked across since childhood, and explaining Plate Tectonics and the volcanic origins of familiar landmarks, the ground seems to shift under our feet as we look at familiar facts from these new points of view.  <br />No doubt Girard gets carried away, and tries to explain too much. Simplicity is the curse of great intellects -- Marx thought love of money was the root of all motivation, Freud over-emphasized sex, and Ernest Becker proposed to explain all human neurosis in terms of fear of death.  Similarly, Girard claims: \\"All human language, and other cultural institutions, in fact, originated in collective murder.\\"  All?  <br />Perhaps Girard is mocking the positivists with his method.  He gives a paltry handful of examples, links them together in the most tenuous way, and tells us he's \\"proven\\" the enormous sweep of his claims.  I sympathize with the minimilist approach from an artistic standpoint, but I'm going to have to think through the data for a while to see if it really fits.  Based on what I know of Chinese history, for example, I think the theory Girard gives in this book may have definite explanatory value.  Last emperors of prior dynasties are usually depicted as villains, and the founders of new dynasties, who generally have blood on their hands, are justified, as part of Girard's theory predicts.  But I doubt even his full theory will fit everything.  <br />Girard seems to know what he's talking about, but sometimes he forgets to explain it adequately to his readers.  He occasionally blunders into sentences like this:  \\"Is it enough to justify our qualifying the interpretation that subverts the representation of persecution by revealing it as scientific?\\"  Uh. . . No!  <br />For all the book's occasional faults, however, I find it changing the way I see society.  Consider, for example, what the experts have been telling us about Islam for the last few months, and the realities of what Mohammed actually did, in light of the following sentence:  \\"Human culture is predisposed to the permanent concealment of its origins in collective violence.\\"  This is exactly what politicians, scholars, and the press have been doing in regard to early Islam.  <br />The way in which Girard explains the phenomena of scapegoating also casts a great deal of light, it seems to me, on the extreme hostility manifest not only in the Muslim world, but even in the West, towards the state of Israel, recently.  The Muslim world is in a turmoil, and the Jews have been set up, as so often before, as the scapegoats -- as Girard's theory predicts.  <br />Girard depicts evil as a second-rate, taudry, and cowardly thing, and shows true heroism in all its beauty.  His discussion of the Gospels and history is especially good.  (In my book, Jesus and the Religions of Man, I describe other scapegoat phenomena from around the world, and relate them in a different but perhaps complementary way to the Gospels.)  <br />The Scapegoat is, in short, well worth attention.  While some of Girard's ideas may be out to lunch, he certainly offers insights here of real and paradigm-shifting value about the nature of man and the work of Christ.	2002-03-19

Irving is a good writer, and at times shows signs of being able to find some action more complicated and interesting than, say, a chemically stimulated beetle might think of to anchor his story.  But in the end, he tends to solve Middle Class angst with the usual unusual permutations of sex.  (I don't mean in the end of the book; I didn't get that far.) For all his good humor and skill as a writer (and the book does flow well), one would hope he would get a life, or at least find one worth telling about, before he foists another story on the world.  It's a pity to see such talent go to waist.  <br />I would have given the book a better rating, anyway, but unfortunately read the preface.  In Irving's rambling introduction, he says he asked his son to review it for him, though he admitted a few qualms about having a 12-year old go through this manuscript.  Mostly, though, he was afraid the boy might not like the thing.  If Irving had confessed to offering his son a glass of carcinogenic chemicals, or even a cigarette, I hope people would be troubled.  Apparently it's no big deal, though, if you poison a child's mind with images of matings with old prostitutes, wife-swapping, and children coming in on their mother giving oral sex to one of her students.  This strikes me as a form of child-abuse.	2002-03-17

Did Christianity Begin with a Mythical Christ? : Challenging the Existence of an Historical Jesus	Books	1	64	157	N	N	Twelve infallible proofs that the moon is square.	Doherty wants us to believe that Jesus never lived.  He offers twelve pieces of the puzzle to establish this fact, none of which, however, are both true and relevent, still less fit together to establish his claim.  What the whole argument really establishes is how desperate and hopeless skeptical criticism is in dealing with the Gospels.       <br />Doherty's main argument is that the epistles hardly ever speak of Jesus in historical terms.  Why not?  Because he hadn't been invented yet.  Doherty spends chapter after chapter asking why Paul or James didn't mention this or that useful detail from the life of Christ, calling up rank after rank of melodramatic rhetorical questions like armies to disconcert the ranks of believers.  <br />I find myself singularly un-disconcerted.  First of all, Doherty explains away, or ignores, passages that do speak of the historical Jesus.  Secondly, even if the epistles never mentioned details from the life of Jesus, so what?  There are few details about Jesus' life in Acts, either, even though it is written as a sequel to Luke.  This fact alone shows the absurdity of the whole book.  <br />As a student of world religions, the fact that the epistles seldom mention Jesus does not surprise me.  I don't expect that from practical polemics.  I don't expect Xun Zi to quote Confucius when he wants to make a point, or Lenin to show the workers baby pictures of Marx.  Doherty does expect such things.  He tells us, &quot;If a Christian writer is urging a certain course of action . . and the founder was known to have taught that very thing, this would almost guarantee&quot; that the writer would mention that.  Yet Doherty himself fails to quote or mention any of the positivists and Humanists who taught him this historical &quot;law&quot; -- raising the question of whether he believes it himself.      <br />When Doherty writes of &quot;critical modern scholarship,&quot; he is generally referring to the Jesus Seminar.  (Like the thief asking the robber for a character reference!)  He builds his house of cards on their houses of cards.  The result is, not surprisingly,   wobbly.  For example, following the Jesus Seminar, he writes in emphatic detail of what the Gospel of &quot;Q&quot; does not contain. &quot;It is a cold, hard fact that none of the elements of the Jerusalem phase of the Gospels appear in Q.&quot;  But it is an even colder and harder fact that he hasn't got Q, and neither has anyone else.  We don't know what was in it, or even if it ever existed.  The Jesus Seminar reconstruction he so confidently bases his arguments on, gives one very wild reconstruction, popular in some circles in the U.S., contradicted in Europe in favor of other wild reconstructions.  On the subject of Q, and many other things, a few pages of a real scholar, like N. T. Wright, (Jesus and the Victory of God) scatters whole chapters of Doherty to the wind, to await the resurrection of broken toys and silly ideas in the last day.  <br />As for Josephus, fellow skeptic Jeff Lowder is superior, and comes to more reasonable (if still slightly mistaken) conclusions. <br />The biggest problem with this book is not its many fallacies, however, but the positive and overwhelming evidence to the contrary it ignores.  <br />Doherty claims, &quot;Those who derive their view of Jesus from the Gospels might be startled to realize the highly elevated nature of the Jesus preached by the early Christians.&quot;  On the contrary, I am always startled by the combination of utter realism and incredible authority of Jesus in the Gospels themselves.  As one scholar put it, we could not have invented him if we wanted to.  Many have tried, in vain.  (See, for example, Per Beskow, Strange Tales About Jesus.)  All the epistles do is translate the extraordinary picture the Gospels paint into the metaphysical images of which Doherty admits (when convenient) the people of the day were so fond. <br />The argument in this book is more hopeless than claiming the earth is flat: more like arguing the moon is square.  You don't need a space ship to see the curviture of the moon; just open your window.  In the same way, open the Gospels, and open your mind, and no amount of sophism (and there are tons of it here) will allow you to un-see the reality of whom you find there.  Unless you try really hard.  <br />Eighty years ago, J. Gresham Machen prophetically noted that materialist dogmas force skeptics into taking absurd positions.  Similarly, the Jesus Seminar strains and struggles to find a merely human Jesus in the Gospels.  But there isn't one.  There is only a supernatural, miracle-working, sin-forgiving Jesus who rises from the dead.  And so Crossan and Funk deny the undeniable, and reject accounts of an obviously historical kind that are accepted in all other contexts (for example, the life of Confucius.) Then even more radical skeptics like Doherty, with a weak understanding of how to reason historically, but a few specious arguments, launch out into the void and think they are standing on the moon, when really they are just standing on the flats of their own hard heads. <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2002-02-19

Beyond Belief is the well-written but somewhat rambling story of the author's revisit to four non-Arab Muslim countries (Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, and Malaysia).  Naipaul says in the preface, \\"This is not a book of opinion.\\"  In my view, that's too bad, because it needs some central idea to give the interesting stories it tells cohesiveness and heart.  Even when Naipaul does give opinions, while he expresses them with iconoclasm and a bit of eloquence, they lack as ideas.<br />Probably the most important theme of the book is how Muslims of other cultures look up to Arab culture and down on their own.  Naipaul describes the attitude he meets that makes invaders into heroes and encourages cultural self-loathing as a \\"dreadful mangling of history.\\"  The consequences are, perhaps, worst in \\"feudal\\" Pakistan.  The pictures he paints should make any Western liberal rethink the doctrine that all religions must, by definition, be created equal; your heart cries for the women, in particular, locked indoors for a lifetime.    <br />But instead of exploring the relationship between Mohammed and modern Islam, Naipaul cops out by generalizing (in a half-hearted way) about \\"revealed religion,\\" Judaism, Islam, and Christianity.  But in essence, I think Islam shares more affinity with Marxism and other revolutionary religions.  Naipaul seems to pick up on some of those similiarities, but doesn't follow the clues to their source. (In Mohammed and Marx.)     <br />Beyond Belief is about the need for roots -- connections with ancestors, traditions, and land.  However, Naipaul sometimes seems to forget that people also have a need for truth -- for universals that transcends the particular.  <br />Naipaul's assumed contrast between the \\"converted\\" and those whose religion is an organic growth from local traditions, while partly true, is largely a false dichotomy.  He forgets that Islam was almost as iconoclastic in regard to Arab culture as it is towards other cultures.  The alternative is for universal truth to find roots in local traditions.  (That is the topic of my research.  Jesus, by contrast to Mohammed, said he came to \\"fulfill,\\" not \\"abolish,\\" Jewish culture.  In the space of a single generation, Christianity went from being Jewish to being a Mediterranean religion.  Lately I have been researching how Indian and Chinese intellectuals have begun to describe the Gospel as the fulfillment of thousands of years of Asian culture in a way that reinvigorates, rather than suppresses, those traditions.  In Japan, by contrast, with its embrace of cold modernity, I find a sterile conformity like that Naipaul decries in Muslim countries.)  The question this book should raise is how the particular can be saved, and enhanced, within the universal -- of finding universals that encourages fitting expression of all that is most human.   <br />Not only his religious, but also his political thought needs deeper study.  He describes the \\"religious state\\" in which \\"religion was not a matter of private conscience\\" as one full of \\"simple roguery.\\"  Perhaps because his subject is Islam, and his background Hindu, he seems to have in mind two simple alternatives -- a false dichotomy between a religion that is entirely private (sanyassi) and one that takes over the state.  (As Mohammed did.) He does not consider the possibility of politics informed and enriched by a faith that is nevertheless kept distinct from the state.  <br />As my first taste of Naipaul, I enjoyed the book.  I found the stories invigorating, timely, and disturbing.  But I don't agree with whatever literary theory of is responsible for the book's lack of coherence and systematic thought.  Naipaul picks up pieces of truth here and there, and examines them with scrupulous honesty, but seems afraid to synthesize a system (at least here) or offer solutions, for fear of rigidity or forced conformity.  Perhaps that is what the title of the book means, that he thinks ideas too dangerous to deal in?  Iput the book down hoping next time Naipaul will go beyond unbelief and tell us what he thinks, but looking forward to reading him again, in any case. <br />(...)	2001-12-14

I have to admit a bias against, and consequent ignorance of, academic philosophy.  I tend to think all human beings are philosophers by nature, but suspect professional philosophers may forget they are human beings.  One measure of my ignorance is that, even though I've written a couple rather philosophical books on the truth of Christianity in relation to other religions, I had never heard of the authors of this book, aside from Plantinga, Adler, and Wolterstorff.  <br />This book seems an ideal introduction to them for someone like me.  (Or, yes, the intellectual but down-to-earth uncle you're looking for a present for.) Most of the autobios are genial and human, written with sometimes surprising honesty.  Reason is not discarded as irrelevent to the spiritual quest, nor given a naive carte blanche, but seems to integrate naturally into the whollist ic engagement with reality that our spiritual lives, with their sometimes ambivalent attitude towards truth, tend to be.  <br />Some of the stories are pretty far out; one or two a bit dull.  Frederick Suppe seems to have lived his life on the edge, and made a wild story even more dramatic by his matter-of-fact style and repressed passion -- a lonely thrill-seeker spending a life trying to choose between God and sin, apparently doing top-notch philosophy (as both vocation and avocation) all the while.  Wolterstorff's warmth and unabashed affirmation of his roots makes a good read.  I noticed a lot of parallel's between Basil Mitchell's story and C. S. Lewis' growth, as described in Surprised by Joy, and enjoyed the story.  I could also relate to Richard Swinburne's honest confession that he tended to be rather glad Christianity was a minority religion, &quot;The more clever people there were to argue against, the better!&quot;  (It reminded me of the French general who, when reminded that his unit was surrounded, replied, &quot;Great!  Then we can attack in any direction!&quot;)  <br />A book is a meeting of minds.  Ananthology arranging a common medium for that meeting to take place.  At its best, this book takes on something of the atmosphere of a campfire on the last day of camp, with the stars overhead, darkness all around, a blaze before us, lending not only light, but warmth as well, as campers of the most thoughtful possible kind through pine cones on the fire and share what they learned over the weekend.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-12-14

The core of this book is a competent, moderately well-written (but never eloquent) account of the central events, figures and movements of Islamic history.  Take the word \\"short\\" in the subtitle seriously, rather than by analogy to H. G. Well's infamously long \\"Outline of History.\\"  The book is 180 scrawny pages.  Despite the length, or lack thereof, and the vast history it presumes to abbreviate, Armstrong does seem to manage to cover the most critical happenings in a concise manner.   <br />The main stylistic problem I found was that the book tends to become top-heavy with names and Arabic words.  Armstrong introduces terms, then uses them on another page, maybe three in a sentence.  In the early going you begin to wonder if, by the end, the whole book won't be in Arabic. <br />Several readers have commented on Armstrong's agenda.  She wants to prove that Islam is not inherently uncivilized or dangerous.  Every religion allows for a variety of interpretations, and the best way to read Islam is in terms of the brotherly, open lifestyles that she proves Mohammed and his early followers followed.  <br />Actually, she doesn't prove this, or anything else, not having room for serious argument in this &quot;short history.&quot;  She claims it.  We're apparently supposed to deduce that she knows what she's talking about from the fact that she's famous, and that there are a lot of references in the back of the book.  (We're left to find out for ourselves that not all of them agree with her thesis.)  If one could parody the message of the book as, &quot;Islam is Quakerism in a hurry,&quot; then one can summarize her style by saying Armstrong is a &quot;historian in a hurry.&quot;     <br />(...) Armstrong argues that the pernicious idea that Islam is a religion of war, is based on a &quot;stereotypical and distorted image of Islam&quot; that is actually a reflexion of Western vice.  &quot;It was when Christians instigated a series of brutal holy wars against the Muslim world that Islam was described as an inherently violent and intolerent faith.&quot;  Oddly, however, it was also described that way before the Crusades -- which is why the Crusades were launched in the first place, in frank imitation of Muslim Jihad.  (See Pope Urban's speech in The First Crusade, edited by Edward Peters.) Is Armstrong suggesting, as some mystical fans of quantum physics have, that sometimes result precedes cause?  <BR>  <BR>At times Armstrong's selection of facts and interpretation of them borders on overt dishonesty.  Many of the evils she puts down to later imperialists -- such as making it a capital offense to criticize Mohammed -- were in fact initiated by the prophet himself.  Armstrong should have known that if she read the books she recommends in her bibliography.  (See, in particular, Rodinson's Mohammed.)<br />While Armstrong's post-hoc, self-indulgent arguments verge on the inane at times, fortunately most of the book is straight history. (Though sometimes even there Armstrong oversimplifies terribly.)  You might find it useful, as an outline, if you supplement it with a books that cover specific aspects of Islamic history in more depth and honesty.  A few I'd recommend are Jihad, by Paul Fregosi, (really amazing), the Crusades Through Arab Eyes, (for the Muslim side), and God of Battles: Holy Wars of Christianity and Islam.  There's a interesting chapter in the Oxford History of Islam on Islam in subSaharan Africa, though even more than Armstrong, the authors of that book tend to look the other way when Muslims are doing things that would reinforce the alleged &quot;stereotypes.&quot;  I'd also like to find a good history of Islam in India, if anyone has any recommendations.    <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-12-03

Jihad is not a work of scholarship, thank goodness.  To see why I think this a virtue, compare what the Oxford History of Islam (edited by John Esposito, whom one critic below recommends in place of Fregosi) says about the Muslim conquerer, Tamerlane. On page 352 of Esposito's book, there is a picture of Tamerlane's tomb.  &quot;His majestic blue-domed tomb epitomizes the splendour of Timurid architecture,&quot; the caption reads.  That's about all you get in 700 plus pages.  Here's Fregosi, on the other hand: &quot;Constantinople was, however, saved for another half century thanks to the intrusion of another massacrer of men, women, and children even viler than Bajazet: the Mongol Timurlane, Muslim ruler of Samarkand, who on his career of conquest across Asia . . . (left) huge piles of decapitated heads as a memento of his visit.&quot;  <br />If you think tiles more important than human beings, Esposito is the man for you, by all means. Personally, I found it refreshing to come across a historian who has less to say about art than about people.  <br />Still, the two volumes can be read as complementary.  The Oxford authors admit, for example, (let the critics below take note) that at the heart of the Ottoman theology was a &quot;divinely given mission to conquer the world.&quot;  Esposito tends to look the other way while the killing is going on, as if out of politeness, while Fregosi thinks we should take a long, hard look at what happened, and figure out why.  <br />The book may sound depressing. I bought it from duty.  But I found myself reading it for pleasure, though skipping some of the worst parts    <br />Jihad is good reading.  Fregosi sprinkles the text with poignant  anecdotes and poetic lines.  &quot;If I have to choose, I prefer to be a camel-driver in Africa rather than a swineherd in Castile.&quot;  &quot;Behold the furthest limits of Andalusia which I have trampled underfoot.&quot;  &quot;If thou wilt not this day help thy children the Christians, at least do not help those dogs the Turks.&quot;  He gives tongue-in-cheek asides on the important in history of wine, women, and song.  (Though sometimes repeats his favorite lines a bit too often -- &quot;cherchez la femme&quot; in particular.) Best of all, he knows that a story needs a hero -- and there is real-life material enough in this book for several great movies.      <br />Fregosi follows the method of Solzhenitsyn of passion directed into sardonic anger.  He is not as good as Solzhenitsyn, of course.  This is not great literature; just a good book, a romance in the old sense, and a vital piece of history.    <br />It is also about as politically incorrect as you can get.  This is not only because the author portrays Mohammed as a bloody tyrant.  (Accurately.  See Rodinson's biography for details.)  Nor is it because he describes jihad, in the military sense, as an Islamic dogma.  (Contrary to the reviewer below, even Oxford agrees, defining jihad, at least for &quot;Muslim exoterists,&quot; as &quot;war of Islamic expansion.&quot;)  Worst of all, he dares to suggest that, while &quot;Christians&quot; often fail to act like Christ, the fundamentals of Christianity and Islam are radically different, and that Jesus had a better idea than Mohammed.<BR>  <BR>I can understand why Muslims, and some sensitive Westerners, would find this offensive.  Proposing that in their essentials, religions actually differ, and that those differences really affect human history, is to many Western liberals like saying the sky is purple.  I suggest that those who believe that Islam is essentially a tolerant and peaceful religion work to bring about a situation in which free religious debate becomes possible even in places like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, and persecution of people of other faiths, and denegration of women, become a lot rarer in the Muslim world.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-11-25

From Lewis, I expected Christian fantasy or philosophy.  Who was this pagan god of the mountain who came to love Psyche?  What was going on in the confusing dream-like sequences towards the end?  Where is God in all of this?  <br />Now I love it.  I've pushed it on other people, and found most &quot;got it&quot; faster than I.  Some of my best Japanese students have read it in my first-year English reading class, and those who have, liked it.  (I recommmend it to them partly because of the brilliant way Lewis depicts ancient Greek and tribal cultures and thought.) Some appreciate the insight and sensitivity with which Lewis depicted his female leading character.  (Thanks, maybe, to his love at the time of writing for a woman of a similarly realistic and strong temperament.) One noted that &quot;This story will tell you how not just Orual but every mortal has an ugly soul.&quot;  She told me that she'd been reading a bit about Greek philosophy, and the book was interesting for that reason, too.  Another said she liked the single combat, admitting, &quot;I know it isn't the most important scene, but I just like it.&quot;  A relative, to whom I gave a copy of the book, told me she read the whole thing (it's not that short) in one sitting.  <br />So I think there's a good chance you'll like the book, too.  As for God, while He is hidden in this story, (as He often is in life) that hiddenness is another layer within the depth within depths that is this novel.  I now tend to think Lewis deserved a Nobel Prize for writing it.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-11-23

This is a remarkable and strange story, told by a person close to Krishnamurti.  A young man is taken from his family in India (seemingly at random) and trained to be a &quot;world teacher&quot; of Theosophy.  After several years of traveling around the world, having fun with his friends, meditating, and developing doubts, he has an intense and torturous mystical experience.  He comes to the conclusion that the only salvation is that we find within ourselves, and strikes out on his own.  <br />I can see why the Dalai Lama likes Krishnamurti.  His own autobiography tells a story that is similiar in many respects -- a lonely young god-king who finds himself, but also shows an attractively human side along the way.  (In the D. L.'s case, he tinkered with watches rather than cars.)<br />The author knew Krishnamurti when both were young, and she was in love with him.  She's evidently still in love, yet manages to tell Krishnamurti's story in an honest manner, including faults and errors as well as a bit of hero-worship.  While I sympathized with him and found him an attractive human being in some ways, I can't say I came away admiring K quite as much as the author clearly does.  As a youth, he seemed to me (being bourgois at heart) like a lonely and mixed up young man who needed a real job and a real family more than anything.  After a long, slow build-up, K's mystic experience is described in painful detail.  Like Mohammed gurus like Muktananda and Sai Baba, it was a painful and bizarre experience that even the principles thought might involve evil spirits.  But then the story takes an unexpected twist.  Rather than launching jihad, or founding an ashram with himself as God, K sets out to teach the world that God -- or &quot;life&quot; -- is no more (or not much more) his monopoly than that of anyone else.  <br />Given Occam's razor, where should we slice?  The author gives little reason to assume that K's grand pronouncements at this stage are true.  She points out, for example, that after his experience, he was still capable of accusing her, falsely, of having an affair with a married man.  Nor do the &quot;un-dogmas&quot; given in this book, at least, strike me as extraordinarily deep.  Truth is &quot;unconditioned&quot; and &quot;pathless,&quot; organized creeds are &quot;crystalized&quot; and &quot;dead.&quot;  &quot;There is neither good nor evil.  Good is that of which you are afraid; evil is that of which you are not afraid.&quot;  These are cliches in some circles, and strike me as the kind of sophism that is just iconoclastic enough to seem profound to mild intellectual rebels.  One can only be called bold for questioning one's own dogmas, not those of someone else.  <br />Many of K's ideas given here appear to me to have been influenced by the Dharmapada and Zen Buddhism.  People couldn't live with such an individual self-help form of Buddhism 2600 years ago.  The author seems to show (see what happens to the other characters in the book) that they can't live with it today, either.  (Even if self-salvation &quot;works&quot; -- or is the highest goal -- which I doubt, especially the latter.)  Tell myself, &quot;I am one of the strong ones.  I can save myself.&quot;  Or is that my pride speaking?  Which means, I am most lost of all?  K himself seemed to entertain similar doubts, at least early on.  His mystic experience may have assured him, while I, frankly, was left wondering why.  <br />This book is mainly the story of K's early life, not his teachings, however.  It is a well-told and touching story.  It gives an inside view of the Theosophy society, and portrays the main characters with sympathy and, most the time, kindness.  (Sometimes to the point of naivitee.)<br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-11-23

This is a beautiful book with a lot of lovely pictures and illustrations, and a great deal of useful and interesting information. I appreciated learning more about sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. The chapter on the context between Aristotilian philosophy and Arabic theology was interesting. I also learned a lot from the chapter on Islam and Christianity, which generally seemed fairly balanced. This rather hefty volume helped fill a large hole in my historical knowledge, and I am sure I will continue to find it a useful resource.<br />I have two major complaints, however. First, I bought the book hoping to learn more about the history of Islam, the religion. While I appreciate the fact that the editor chose to tell us about art and law and economics too, it often seemed like the history of Islam, the religion, got drowned out the somewhat accidental details of Islam, the civilization.<br />In particular, I came to the text with questions such as, \\"How did Islam spread? What motivated those who spread it? How did the teachings and example Mohammed, in particular, affect human history?\\" These seem like reasonable questions to ask of an \\"Oxford History of Islam.\\" But there was almost nothing about Mohammed in the book. (Fortunately, I had just read Maxime Rodinson's Mohammed, which is a good supplement to that portion of the book.) While the authors gave a great deal of information around the edges of other great expansionist periods in Islamic history, some kind of scholarly miopia seemed to prevent them from getting to the heart of the matter.<br />I wanted to know, for example, if the frequent claim that Indonesia became Muslim peacefully were true. Bruce Lawrence, in his chapter on Islam in Southeast Asia, hardly addressed the question of how the islands became Muslim, except, for example, in the following subordinate clause of one sentence: \\"Although the actual Islamic conquest of the Javanese kingdom of Majapahit took place in 1478, . . . \\"<br />That bringsme to my second complaint. On page 352, there is a photo of a tomb, identified as that of Tamerlane. \\"His majestic blue-domed tomb epitomizes the splendor of Timurid architecture,\\" the caption reads. When I read that, and leafed through the index for further references, I had to wonder: what kind of history of Islam is it that, in 750 pages, cannot find room for a single clear sentence about the greatest Muslim conquerer of all -- and less for his millions of victims?  It is like writing a history of communism and only noting, in passing, that a fellow named Stalin inspired a new movement in socialist realist painting. (Granted, however, that the tyrants of yesteryear had much better taste in art.)<br />Similiarly, Lawrence seems to completely whitewash the thousand-year history of the Islamic assault on India, that Durant describes as \\"probably the bloodiest story in human history.\\" Sultan Mahmud, the text merely notes, \\"not only pillaged and destroyed; he also built and rebuilt.\\" (As, of course, did Stalin.)<br />It is said that history is written by the winners. The authors seem to want to prove that aphorism. Mohammed's own cruel career is glossed over a few pages. Tamerlane is memorialized with a pretty tomb, his victims ignored.  Nehemia Levtizion seems to blame the Ethopians for putting up too good a fight, therefore bringing jihad down on themselves. (As opposed to other tribes that were simply swallowed.) Another writer calls the Medieval Europeans \\"xenophobic,\\" and the European idea that Islam is violent is treated as a prejudice.  Muslim armies had just conquered two thirds of the Christian world, launched attacks against Rome and Constantinople, and into France. If two out of three of your children had been kidnapped by a neighbor, would it be fair to call you \\"paranoid\\" if you locked your doors at night? (Or even in the day?)  (See Jihad for more details.)<br />One author mentions an Islamic attrocity -- discreetly, so as not to embarrass anyone -- then marches on to the dogmatic but question-begging conclusion, \\"The contest is over political authority even when it is framed as a contest over religious truth.\\" How, in a religion that does not distinguish between mosque and state, is one to tell the difference? And can we really generalize about what made Muslim conquerers tick in this way?  From what sources?<br />Ira Lapidus is more frank, and suggests perhaps a bit more sympathy with the victims, in her description of the tyrannical Ottoman empire and its \\"divinely given mission to conquer the world.\\"  Again, I would have appreciated more details on exactly how the Ottomans formulated and explained their ideology, and how they related it to the Qu'ran and the career of Mohammed. But at least she does mention the \\"losers.\\"<br />The book probably does deserve the five stars (...), in some respects. But I am getting tired of this habit of scholars whitewashing inhumanity and painting a pretty picture on top. I felt like giving it one star, in protest. But a lot of good scholarship and artistry went into the text as well, and it would be unfair not to acknowledge that.<br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-11-20

First, missions in Indian was a &quot;conspiracy&quot; for good, not, as the journalist Arun Shourie argued, for the enslavement of India.  Mangalwadi does a pretty good job of proving this point, and the book is certainly worth reading on that basis alone.  He describes, in interesting detail, the duel for the soul of England, between money-grubbing traders, old-fashioned imperialists, evangelists in the vanguard of the revival led by John Wesley, who set out to reform India and the world.  (Another good, though less readable, book on a similiar subject is Crusaders Against Opium, the story of the battle between missionaries and English traders a few decades later over the opium trade in China.)<br />Mangalwadi writes with passion, balance, and erudition, giving appropriate qualifications most of the time, such as that some missionaries really were lackeys of the Raj.  He has read widely in many fields.  Yet he criticizes secularism with a straightforward honesty that many Westerners may find bracing: &quot;Why are you unwilling to allow God to treat the cancer that corrupts our hearts?&quot;  At times he is a bit prosaic, but at other times the argument becomes a brilliant synthesis of economics, history, social analysis, raw spirituality and evangelical zeal that may baffle his more timid secular readers at first.  For those who would like to consider further how Christ influenced Indian society for the good, I recommend Mangalwadi's other books, and (for a look at Jesus and incluencial new Hindu sects) Modern Religious Movements in India, by J. N. Farquhar.<br />Mangalwadi's second thesis is that good Biblical theology (but not idolatrous or insincere Christianity) is the most important basis of freedom and progress in any society.  Here Mangalwadi may have bitten off more than he can chew.  I think a case can be made for the centrality of the Gospel in social progress.  (See my book, Jesus and the Religions of Man, chapter 7: How Jesus has Changed the World.  Also see Charles Thaxton, The Soul of Science: Christian Faith and Natural Philosophy.)  But Mangalwadi only considers history in terms of ideas: he does not consider the power of technological revolutions to raise living standards even apart from spiritual revival.  Nor does he adequately address the question of how some nations, such as Japan, have managed to modernize without becoming Christian.  (Though certainly under the influence of Christianity.)  Overall, though, this is a highly thoughtful, passionate, and interesting book, and is well worth reading.	2001-11-12

Robert Coles is the kind of guy who can get away with saying &quot;Tolstoy knew the emotions of childhood better than Freud.&quot;  One would think that would be comparing apples and oranges, or some other kind of fruit, but one of Coles' beliefs is that life is one, and the borders of &quot;social science&quot; and human experience as narrated by the great thinkers of the past, not only ought to be transcended, but are pretty much meaningless anyway.

And it is almost as rich in characters and stories within stories (here Solzhenitsyn is very like Tolstoy) as life: constancy in love, artistic integrity, the whimspy of fate, literacy in Medieval Novgorod, the prison in the Count of Monte Cristo, snow, how to sew, the law of unintended consequences.<br />A few major abiding themes run like threads throughout the book, providing unity: First, the life of the &quot;zek,&quot; the prisoner in Stalin's camps.  Second, loneliness: not just of prisoners longing for a woman or lost loved ones, or of persecuted wives trying to make lives for themselves, but ultimately of each person.  Every conversation carries a different meaning for the people involved.  The author &quot;gets inside of peoples heads&quot; in an amazing way -- from the janitor Spiridon to the &quot;Best Friend of Counter-Intelligence Operatives,&quot; Joseph Stalin himself.  Third, and on a deeper level, integrity, both artistic and moral.<br />Fourth, and I don't know if this was the conscious intent of the author or not, the book reminds us of the unity of Western civilization.  Aside from mentions of Tolstoy, Dostoevski, Pushkin, and Lermontov, (which, I might add, also describes the company Solzhenitsyn belongs in, with honor), the book is honeycombed with references to the great thinkers and artists of European civilization -- from the ancient Greeks and the Gospels, to Dante, the Holy Grail, Bach and Beethoven.  The Marxist Rubin even quotes Luther.  Primarily, no doubt this is a reflection of the fact that the prisoners in the &quot;sharashkas,&quot; the top-secret scientific work camps, were educated men, unlike, say, the hero of his shorter novel, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.  (The contrast Solzhenitsyn draws to their well-paid Neanderthal captors is just one form of the irony that is his most distinctive and powerful stylistic weapon. But even theNeanderthals, including Stalin himself, are portrayed not as cardboard villains, but with insight and imagination.)  These references also remind us that, as much as Solzhenitsyn has been accused of being a &quot;Slavophobe,&quot; as if that were an insult, the Russian culture he loves is an integral part of Western civilization.  This iconic dialogue of the ages, similiar to the works of great Chinese painters, also adds another layer of delight to the book.<br />The final and greatest thread that unifies this work is the idea of achieving humanity, of becoming what a person ought to be, of heroism.  The prisoners are poets, eccentric, and philosophers (though there are also scoundrels, and everyone is tempted that way), beaten down by life and the forces of disolution within, trying to preserve their souls, or civilization, from the barbarians who are their masters.  In describing the simple heroism of some of his characters, Solzhenitsyn achieves brilliance.  In my opinion, First Circle is the greatest of his works, and one of the most powerful pieces of writing of the 20th Century, at least.  And it is not about the Gulag, primarily: it is about what it means to be human, and the choices we all face.<br />Aside from the characters and stories, many of the scenes are wonderful (again like Tolstoy): of Rubin standing in the courtyard at night in the snow when he hears the train whistle, of the party at the prosecutor's house, of the arrest of the diplomat.  If life is sometimes too strange for fiction, (and it is) there are also pieces of fiction that seem truer than life.  First Circle is a marriage of style and substance made in heaven,  or at least, the highest circle of hell.<br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-11-04
US	50798783	R32G65I68SO7P3	0394716779	531601898	Mohammed	Books	5	7	11	N	N	Good bio of one mean dude.	If you are looking for an opinionated but fair-minded sketch of the prophet Mohammed in the context of his times, by a historian who is not out to portray his subject as the devil incarnate, but is still gamely willing to relate events and interpret them in a straightforward way that might lose him his head in some countries -- this could be the book for you.  This book is lively, surprisingly balanced for a work by a Marxist, keeps the tangents short and sweet, and strikes me as generally judicious history.  I don't share the author's materialism, and sometimes his attitude strikes me as a bit patronizing and cynical.  But the story is well-told and insightful.  And even when the author may be (in my view) wrong, his error usually consists of useful insights that are spread too thin.  <br />Politicians, the media, and academics have been diligently trying to persuade us, of late, that Islam is a religion of peace.  The terrorists are &quot;traitors to their faith,&quot; which is &quot;good and peaceful.&quot;<br />Mr. Rodinson does not set out specifically to tear down this viewpoint.  He does warn, in his straightforward way, that &quot;Muslims have every right not to read the book or to aquaint themselves with the ideas of a non-Muslim, but if they do so, they must expect to find things put forward there which are blasphemous to them.&quot;  But later he notes disapprovingly of Christian critics that &quot;the accounts given of (Mohammed) by his disciples were taken and twisted to make a hideous portrait of a cruel and lascivious individual, steeped in every kind of viciousness and crime. . . &quot;  This comment comes towards the end of the book.  He seemed not to have noticed that in the previous 200 pages, he had painted a very similar portrait.  It appears, strangely enough, that the facts themselves may have something to do with the &quot;image.&quot;  But read the book for yourself, and tell me if Mohammed was a good man or bad. <br />author, Jesus and theReligions of Man	2001-10-18

This book is a collection of sayings and stories attributed to Jesus in the Muslim community, mostly in the first few centuries of the Islamic Empire.  Many are just plain fascinating.  Some take the form of &quot;Jesus said&quot; followed by some quotable moral lesson that makes Jesus sound like a teacher of eternal truth, like Confucius.  Some prop up Quranic orthodoxy and sound more like Mohammed than Jesus (&quot;Women are the ropes of Satan&quot;).  One would even fit perfectly into the Dao Dejing (&quot;If people appoint you as their heads, be like their tales&quot;), but then some Chinese philosophers say Lao Zi and Jesus share that idea in common, anyway.  Sometimes I even spot a touch of what could be Zhuang Zi.  But in quite a few others, the Jesus of the Gospels appears, healing, doing acts of compassion, offering forgiveness, speaking in words that challenge, even bringing people back to life.  (There are some very odd twists to these stories!) Often even the sayings that do not sound like Jesus (which is most of them) are elegant and noteworthy.  I didn't find the work as a whole much more revisionist or self-serving than, say, your average Jesus Seminar Gospel.  And it sure beats the hard-core Muslim Gospel of Barnabas or the stories of Jesus going off to Tibet and studying magic and Advetic philosophy.   <br />I read the text itself first, then the introduction, and that seemed the best way to do it.  Better let &quot;Jesus,&quot; or the scholars who invent or rewrite sayings by him rather, speak for themselves.  But the Khalidi's introduction and explanations are lucid, insightful and helpful.  This is a classy bit of scholarship.<br />Edward Said, in his review on the back cover, seems to see this book as an answer to those who make &quot;bellicose and false claims about the clash of civilizations,&quot; an obvious jab at Samuel Huntington.  I don't think the book is any such thing, nor does Khalidi seem to present it as such.  Europeans who calledthemselves Christians did not see any conflict between singing the psalms of David, and persecuted David's descendents, even on the same day. (July 15, 1099, for example.) Even less does the fact that Mohammed called Jesus &quot;breath of God&quot; nullify the centuries-long war of conquest he launched against his neighbors, or the fact that in many Muslim lands today, a Muslim who chooses to go beyond what the Qur'an allows in regard to Jesus, will be in danger of his life.  In fact, the limits of that orthodoxy are defined in many passages of this book.  One should not confuse literary influence with religious tolerance.  <br />At the same time, this book reminds us that Islam allowed for more than one prophet, and that the character and teaching of one alternative, anyway, did balance the tone and substance of the other to some extent.  Some of the sayings of Jesus in this Gospel (&quot;The folds of heaven are empty of the rich;&quot; &quot;If you desire to devote yourselves entirely to God. . . be kind to those who are unkind to you;&quot;) could even be read as a rebuke to that prophet who set out to conquer the world for Allah with a sword -- or followers who seek to do the same with more high-tech weapons today. <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-10-14
US	50798783	R16K04L0IQ8OI8	0824515218	210509327	Quarks Chaos & Christianity: Questions to Science and Religion	Books	5	61	64	N	N	Honest, lucid, and persuasive.	Simplistic and erroneous thinking about &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;science&quot; is rife in our era.  John Polkinghorne sets himself the task of accurately describing the relationship between them.  He refutes the usual lazy assumption that the two belong to completely unrelated categories, like walruses and carpenters.  Polkinghorne is convinced that in fact science and religion (at least Christianity) both require a similiar method of truth-seeking.  He believes that the search for truth in science was influenced by the Christian belief in God, and that the logical connection between believing in a Creator and studying the creation still holds.  He thinks scientific metaphors shed light on theology, and vice-versa.  Thus, not only is there no conflict between being a scientist and a follower of Christ, the two disciplines inform and supplement one another.  <br />Polkinghorne's words seem to carry a special gravitus.  Part of the reason for this, of course, is that he knows his stuff: he was a first-class scientist, physics prof at Cambridge, before getting into theology.  Also, in this book, he writes with the kind of restrained simplicity that is good style for scientists writing for the masses, that strongly suggests great intellectual power, sheathed as it were.  But probably what gives his argument greatest force is his honesty.  The more I read Polkinghorne, the less believable it seems to me that his argument for Christianity might be given either in ignorance or in defiance of the evidence.  He might concede too much at times, and he tends to be cautious, but he does not seem to put more weight on an argument than the evidence can bare.  <br />I especially liked what Polkinghorne said about faith and reason.  &quot;Many people seem to think that faith involves shutting one's eyes, gritting one's teeth, and believing X impossible things before breakfast . . . Not at all!  Faith may involve a leap, but it's a leap into the light, not the dark.  THe aim of the religious quest, like that of the scientific quest, is to seek motivated belief about what is the case. . . &quot;  While a lot of people (both Christians and skeptics) seem to prefer to define faith as believing something contrary to the evidence, I don't think that is either the Biblical or the historically usual Christian point of view.  Polkinghorne's argument on this point stakes out the mainstream of Christian thought, in my opinion.  <BR>Readers who would like to think through the relationship between faith and reason, and between various faiths, in more detail, might find my book, Jesus and the Religions of Man, worth a read as well.	2001-10-01

History is often sanitized for the secular public.  One part of that sanitization is the down-playing of the impact reformist Christianity had around the world in the 19th Century, not only on the social mores of the West (slavery, prostitution, etc.) but really to the ends of the earth.  An article on feminist reforms in China need make no mention of Christian missions.  (Never mind that the great Chinese scholar Hu Shi admitted that missionaries \\"taught us . . . to look at women as people.\\")  You can read of reform movements in Hinduism without learning what spiritual influence it was that caused such movements to spring up at that particular moment. <br />This is a secret that historians don't usually let out: that Christian missions changed the world in the 19th Century.  <br />Kathleen Ludwick's book is an important and unusual contribution to the social history of our times.  Ludwick portrays the competition between two groups of foreigners in China, both of whom (as the Chinese scholar Lin Yutang put it) no doubt thought the other mad: businessmen, who came to China to enrich themselves at the expense of the Chinese by selling opium, and Christian missionaries, who came to save the souls of the Chinese, and help them in any other way as well if possible.  She argues: \\"More than any other group at the turn of the 20th Century, the Protestant missionaries in China truly understood the nature of opium addiction and had the courage to pursue their campaign against the drug until they finally convinced others of the correctness of their position.\\"  Many of the missionaries involved were of course doctors, though she shows that on this issue, at any rate, missionaries found a remarkable degree of harmony and agreement among themselves, even such different spirits as Hudson Taylor and James Legge.  She also gives some details of the arguments by which the British government (with, of course, help from the respectable drug dealers themselves) justified ruining millions of lives.  This book is full of details, some of them quite interesting, others a little dry by now.  The author's tone is fairly even-handed, though she is not so \\"scholarly\\" that she is afraid to take sides in such a clear-cut battle between right and wrong.  <br />This volume presents a small part of a tremendously important historical narrative, and thus belongs in any college library.  Chinese who have grown up hearing from their government about how closely the missionaries were implicated in imperialism, might especially find it worth reading.  I also recommend it to Christians who are involved in similiar prophetic acts of social justice today, helping drug addicts or opposing abortion, who are looking for encouragement....	2001-10-01

Few subjects are more intrinsically interesting, in my opinion, than the relationship between European and Chinese thought.  The arrival in China of the Jesuits reads, to me, a little like the old commercial for the candy bar, when the boy munching on the chocolate collides in the hall-way collides with the girl chewing the peanut butter.  &quot;Hey, you got peanut butter on my chocolate.&quot;  In my opinion, and in the opinion of many modern Chinese, Christianity and Chinese tradition really are two great tastes (kept apart for thousands of years) that taste great together.  (I've even written a book, True Son of Heaven: How Jesus Fulfills the Chinese Culture, to prove that point.)  <br />This book is a scholarly look at the history of this earliest connection between some very thoughtful Catholic missionaries and the Chinese intelligensia.  It gives the story of Ricci, Alleni, and also the story of three prominent converts to Christianity, among other things.  A good deal of the book is about Matteo Rici, who comes across as a truly remarkable individual, both intellectually and as a human being.  Historians, including those here, tend to admire him for adapting Christianity to Chinese culture, at the expense of some arrogant and ignorant missionaries who came later.  In my opinion, it was the later missionaries who were off base, in terms of Christian tradition, rather than the Jesuits, in that, in the blindness of European power, they failed to utilize principles of cultural adaptation that had been laid out by central Christian thinkers like Paul, John, Justin, Clement, and Augustine. <br />As these essays show, the Jesuits held to a policy of &quot;rejecting Buddhism and accomodating with Confucianism.&quot;  They also tended to exagerate the moral character of Western society.  In my opinion, Augustine showed that it is possible to relate Christianity in a more holistic manner to all segments of society, and to be quite frank and honest, in creating an orthodox Christian apologetic that meets the needs of a civilization.  Many modern Christian Chinese agree with the Chinese scholar Ye Xianggao in interpretting Christianity not as a rejection of Chinese culture, but rather as its fulfillment. &quot;Ordinary Confucianists do indeed talk frequently of Heaven, but they behave as if Heaven is far away.  (The Jesuits), on the other hand, speak of Heaven as connected intimately with us . . . This is most appropriate for awakening the world.&quot;  <br />My main criticism is that the scholars involved seem too focused on these particular cases, and contrasting them only to later bad examples, that they fail to relate the story to the larger context of Christian fulfillment theology, of more recent works that expand upon Ricci's excellent example, and, frankly, what God might be up to.  But I found several essays worth reading.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-09-28

Farquhar, one of a remarkable breed of missionary scholars, has here written the history of how &quot;Hinduism&quot; emerged from the confluence of traditional religion and the Gospel in modern India.  He accomplishes this by describing key thinkers and religious organizations up to the date at which he wrote (early in the 20th Century), and showing what each borrowed from Christian teaching, and what each left on the table.  The people and groups whose stories he tells include such important figures as Ram Mohan Ray and the Brahma Samaj, the Deva Samaj, Sayananda, Parahamsa, Ramakrishna and Vivekananda, the infamous Madame Blavantsky and the Theosophist Society, and others more obscure, not only in Hinduism, but also in Islam and Sikhism.  (There is, unfortunately, not much about Gandhi yet.)  As a passionate Christian, Farquhar is not writing &quot;neutral&quot; history, whatever that is, but is continuing his argument (as in Crown of Hinduism) that Christ completes what was lacking in Indian religion.  That does not mean he is unjust; he is in fact honest and fair-minded, looks for good to balance whatever criticism he offers, and never thrashing anyone who doesn't appear to deserve it.  But he also says what he really thinks.  &quot;Vivekanda has no historical conscience whatsoever.&quot; &quot;(Ramakrishna) impressed all who came in contact with him as a most sincere soul, as a God-intoxicated man, but what distinguished his message . . . was his defense of everything Hindu and his theory that all religions are true.&quot;   &quot;The depths to which Mrs. Blavatsky habitually descends in defending Hinduism will hardly be believed.  There is scarcely an exploded doctrine, scarcely a superstitious observance, which she has not defended with the silliest and most shameful arguments.&quot;  Yet even in the &quot;indescribable rubbish&quot; of Theosophical teachings Farquhar found a few things of value.  <br />J. N. Farquhar was, in short, a gentleman and a scholar.  If you want to understand the amorphous set of doctrines and practices that make up modern &quot;Hinduism,&quot; you'll want to read primary sources, of course, Indian classics and works by modern interpretters, but this book and Crown of Hinduism are excellent places to go for a fair but engaged overview.  I also recommend an equally passionate by a modern Indian Christian, Vishal Mangalwadi, called World of the Gurus.  Mangalwadi describes more recent Indian gurus, like Sai Baba and the Bagwan Rajneesh.<br />Some people claim Jesus went to India as a young man.  Farquhar makes short work of that claim (also see Per Beskow's Strange Tales about Jesus), but he also makes it clear that in a difference sense, one might say that Jesus did come to the subcontinent later on, and participated deeply in the founding of the modern Indian civilization.    <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-09-26

I received this book in the mail one day earlier this month, and finished it by about the same time the next day -- despite the fact that I had three 90 minute college classes to teach, and needed to prepare for a trip to Taiwan. It was that good, and that aweful. <br />I had devoured a good chunk of the book by the time I turned on my computer and learned the terrible news from New York. I kept reading; there seemed to be a connection. The book is an absolutely mind-blower of a story, but if we were to translate the events it describes into a thesis, one sub-point of that thesis would be: \\"Mass murder and sincere spirituality are not mutually exclusive, by any means.\\" As Ritchie put it, \\"(Ex-shaman and Yamomamo Indian Shoefoot) has no problem understanding the Columbine High School massacre or any other killing spree. The spirits of anger and hatred that own and drive a person are spirits he has known personally.\\" It occured to me that we have the same choice as confronts the \\"converted\\" village in this book: to seek justice with mercy and caution, and danger to ourselves, or to pass on forgiveness and descend to the level of our enemies. While in Taiwan, I was asked to speak about the relationship between Christianity and Islam, and found myself wishing I'd brought the book along. Jungleman puts so many things so well. <br />This is not a book you want to read your children to sleep by. It might not even work for your church (still less, coven) book-of-the-month club.  Besides being full of violence, its message will be a challenge to skeptics and those who are attracted to the occult.  But anyone who is untouched by it, by the pain, beauty, pathos, irony, and danger of being human that it reveals, of living in a spiritual jungle as responsible beings, must have a heart of stone. Jungleman reminds us that before a person is a \\"native\\" and subject of anthropological study, he is a human being -- and that \\"social scientists\\" and missionaries forget their common humanity and responsibility to Yai Pada, the Great Spirit, at their own peril.  As a student of world religions who has written a bit about the occult in Asian traditions and the idea of God in Asian belief systems, I found a great deal that was a priori credible in this inside description of the Yanomamo culture, though of course I have no means of vouching for the specific accuracy of the events it records. <br />Mark Ritchie's earlier book, God in the Pits, is also worth a read, though it is not as mind-blowning as this book.  I also recommend Peace Child, by Don Richardson, which comes close to resembling Spirit of the Rainforest, though more conventional in approach, it is also a remarkable true story of a stone-age tribe that meets Jesus. <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man // ...	2001-09-24

There are some good things in this book: the appendix, in which the author retells the story of science through the lives of Bacon, Descartes, Brahe, Pascal, Kepler, Galileo, and the rest; the illustrations, including the authors own photos and cartoons (the fossilized Spitfire was pretty funny); and even an occasion telling argument. But unfortunately, specific, detailed evidence to back up the main points is one of the things the book is short on. Broom contradicts the first principle of expository writing: show it, don't just say it. He repeatedly asserts that natural selection doesn't make sense in a materialistic world, that early life experiments are unrealistic, and so on, but gives few specifics. He blathers on with philosophy and repetition of his main points when he should be backing them up with hard scientific facts, figures, and specific evidence. His overall argument may be right, (though I'm not quite sure I know what it is, exactly) and certainly some of his points make sense to me, but they are poorly developed. <br />I wish you well, Dr. Broom.  But you'll need more than cartoons and bald assertion if you want to overthrow a theory of origins as widely accepted as Darwinism.<br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-09-10

Out of the Silent Planet is science fiction in the sense that, in order to create a fantasy for adults, Lewis had to send his hero and villains to a world far enough for a re-imagining, but near enough that they could plausibly go there from here.  Lewis not being a scientist, and this book being sixty years old, the plausibility of Lewis' idea of space travel wears quite thin by now, though of course he didn't mean to be taken seriously on that count even then.  A more serious problem Lewis set himself to solve was, &quot;What might an unfallen world look like?&quot;  And also, &quot;What might a society in harmony with God and nature look like?&quot;  or &quot;What is the nature of rationality and soulishness?&quot;  I find some of Lewis' ideas unsatisfying.  (Paradise and survival of the fittest are difficult concepts to reconcile; if the Malacandrians are all at peace, how did they evolve, as Lewis apparently thinks they did?  And how does the ecosystem avoid being overrun with critters?) Still, this book is a great fantasy with many insights, and a lot of fun to read.  No one I know combines so fertile an imagination with such philosophical depth and psychological acuity as C. S. Lewis.  All these are in evidence here.  <br />The planet is a beauty.  Among Malacandra's cauliflower highlands and tourquoise canyons, its philosopher bird-spectres and tribal seals, Lewis enacts an exciting story.  His readers will find some familiar images and themes: island paradise, the cultural dynamics of tribes and Greek philosophers living side by side (see Till We Have Faces for more), the wind-bag philosopher posing as scientist posing as philosopher.  (The passage in which Ransom translates Weston's defense of planetary imperialism and genocide into &quot;Malacandrian&quot; then, for our benefit, simple English, is a classic blend of linguistics and philosophy.  See George Orwell, Politics and the English Language, for an essay from that period that, in effect, explains what Lewis is doing with that deceptively simple passage, and why it desperately needs to be done.  See also Abolition of Man.) <br />This is the tightest and shortest of Lewis' three &quot;sci-fi&quot; novels.  You can read it in a few hours.  Lewis was probably wise to shift to frankly supernatural means of locating his heroes to other worlds, in later fantasies.  Still, don't miss this wonderful tour of Mars for the world.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-09-07

One gets the impression, as one reads the brilliant character sketches Russell draws of the scholars and lords and ladies who made up his circle of aquaintances, that the English upper class was mostly mad, scoundrels, or geniuses, with a fair amount of overlap.  (The author as an outstanding case in point.)  The keenness of Russell's insight into character, vivid descriptions, and eye for the absurd, make many passages of this book a delight.  \\"My advice to anyone who wishes to write is to know the very best literature by heart, and ignore the rest as completely as possible.\\"  \\"The past is an aweful God, though he gives life almost the whole of its haunting beauty.\\"  \\"(Plato's) austerity in matters of art pleases me, for it does not seem to be the easy condemnation that comes from the Phillistine.\\"  Reading Why I am Not a Christian ..., I got the impression that he had a gloomy outlook on life.  But here, I often found great joy in poetry, nature, and the wonder of life.  \\"I had never, till that moment, heard of Blake, and the poem affected me so much that I became dizzy and had to lean against the wall.\\" Tempered, however, by morbid thoughts, and fear of insanity.  <br />One of the odder aspects of the book to me was Russell's \\"idealism.\\"  On one page, he speaks of a mystical experience in which gave him a universal compassion for all mankind: on the very next page, he relates how he \\"fell out of love\\" with his wife, and then, how he ditched her.  Passing from the same Bodhissattva-like musings elsewhere, he relates, on the next page or so, how he tried to strangle a friend in a rage.  He can be sympathetic and even kind, but for a would-be Boddhisattva and fighter for the rights of women, he seems to have hurt a lot of ladies, in particular, rather badly.  Yet his friendships in general, with both sexes, seem warm and affectionate.  <br />I docked the book a star because the version I bought (Bantom) seemed dishonest in its packaging.  The front and back covers show an old man, though this version only covers the period to 1914.  On the back cover, it promises \\"more exciting episodes than most novels, details more intimate than most exposes, and more intensity of emotion than most fiction writers would dare ascribe to a single hero.\\"  Largely hype.  This is not Dumas, or Augustine.  It's a different kind of story.        <br />Someone else on the back cover calls Russell \\"a Genius-Saint.\\"  Genius, maybe, but the second accolade implies very low standards for sainthood.  The book did make me think Russell a more balanced figure than I thought.  But part of that balance appears to have been something like madness, and something like cruelty.  Intellectually, Russell was a brilliant man.  Emotionally, he often strikes me as a lonely and bewildered child, angry at being abandoned, not sure where to look for love, and not sure how to give it.      <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-07-09

When I read A. N. Wilson on Jesus, I closed the book and thought, \\"That's a pretty good book, about Wilson.\\"  When I read Crossan, I thought, \\"Here is the man who should have written the Book of Mormon.\\"  Wright first suggested to me the hope that historical criticism might actually have something of value to say about Jesus.  <br />Wright's approach has many virtues.  He is intimately familiar with an incredible amount of scholarly literature on the subject, and refers to it in a way that is always thoughtful.  He seldom arbitrarily discards evidence merely because it doesn't fit his theory, as many do.  His favorite critical device is what he calls the principle of \\"double similarity, double disimilarity.\\"  He shows that, while most of the synoptic material makes sense both within the Jewish community, and as the template for the new Christian religion, it also differs from both traditions in ways that strongly suggest the marks of individuality, that neither ordinary Jews nor Christians would have invented for Jesus.    <br />This is a helpful approach, in my opinion, though not so unique as Wright seems to think.  Readers with literary or psychological sensitivity have been making similiar, less systematic but sometimes even more insightful, observations for a long time.  See, for example, G. K. Chesterton (Everlasting Man), Philip Yancey (The Jesus I Never Knew), M. Scott Peck, Per Beskow (Strange Tales About Jesus) or C. S. Lewis (Fernseeds and Elephants -- an essay Wright scoffs at, but that grows in my estimation the more I read of modern Biblical criticism).  I think any reader can discern the unique style of Jesus in the Gospels.  To a certain extent, Wright is just approaching the unique character of Jesus' sayings in a more formal, and less intuitive, manner.  <br />As a scholar who studies the (often amazing) ways in which Christianity fulfills Asian cultures, I especially appreciated Wright's deep insights into the relationship between the Jewish tradition and the life of Christ.  Wright argues that these elements were not retroactively inserted in the narrative, but most probably derive directly from Jesus.  I don't recall that Wright places much emphasis on it, but in a sense, much of the argument here could be summarized by Jesus' statement: \\"Don't think I have come to do away with the Law and the Prophets . . . I have come to fulfill them.\\"  I believe that applies to more than Jewish culture, but that is another story.    <br />The greatest drawback of this book is that Wright takes himself and his colleagues too seriously, in my opinion.  When Wright says, \\"All agree that Jesus began his public work in the context of John's baptism,\\" he means, \\"all we scholars.\\"  The fact that billions of other readers usually come to the same conclusion, is, to Wright, irrelevent.  The same, when he tells us, \\"It is apparent that the authors of the synoptic gospels intended to write about Jesus, not just their own churches and theologies,\\" (really!) that \\"one of the chief gains\\" of the last 20 years of scholarship has been to link the crucifixion of Jesus to his cleansing of the temple, (my grandma could have told them that) and that when Jesus cursed the fig tree, he was acting out a parable against the Jewish religious rulers.  Biblical scholars resemble the emperor's fashion experts, who, after decades of involved debate, and several fads in nudity, make the astonishing discovery that the emperor has no clothes.  They pat themselves on their backs and complement one another for their brilliance, as the little boy, who first made the observation decades before, rocks in his chair in a retirement home nearby.  <br />Chesterton said, one of the ways to get home is to stay there.  Wright allows that Biblical criticism is taking a more circuitous route, (he himself uses the metaphor of the Prodigal Son), and he almost makes me think the view along the way might be worth it.  But if he choses to lecture about the layout of thefamily farm when he returns, he ought to acknowledge that some of his hearers have been on that ground for a while already.  Wright seems less kind to his conservative Christian \\"elder brethren\\" than to younger (separated) brethren still sowing wild oats in the far country of historical speculation.  This attitude troubles me.     <br />After hundreds of pages of argument, Wright rather abruptly asserts that \\"Jesus did not know he was God,\\" at least not as one knows one \\"ate an orange an hour ago.\\"  He thinks such self-knowledge would be unbecomingly \\"supernatural.\\"  (Though he doesn't quibble with multiplied loaves or the resurrection.)  At this point one gets the feeling that Wright's conclusion (or guess) is based less on historical evidence (which, as another reader points out below, ought to include John, Paul, and other Jewish Christians), but on a desire to keep a souvenir from the far country -- perhaps to show other scholars.  Or maybe he just doesn't want to sound too conventional -- publish novelties (\\"discoveries\\") or off with your academic head.  In any case, one wonders if his own dogmatically expressed opinion about Jesus' sub-divine mode of consciousness itself has a supernatural origin.  He offers no other sources, in this case.  <br />There seem to be two ways to \\"see\\" Jesus.  One is the scholar's approach, which is that of blind men touching an elephant -- each connecting with that which communicates, with special vividness, a focused reality.  The other method is that of the unwashed masses, who see the whole, though dimly at times, as through a fog.  To see Christ as he is, yet without reductionism, has not proven an easy task for anyone.  I do not know if it is the holiest, wisest, humblest, or just the most desperate, who come closest.  Wright shows that, if a blind man touches the elephant in enough places, and takes scholarly theories for the narrow simplifications that they tend to be, he may begin a fairly recognizable and systematic mapping of the shape before us, which, in the end, may help see the elephant once again.  It is a  brilliant and insightful work.  And, I am beginning to think, one very patient elephant, to put up with modern criticism, and not step on anyone.  <br />Pardon the long review.  The book is longer.  Be warned....	2001-07-07

The Case for Faith is a simple and readable book based on a good idea: interview top Christian thinkers about questions that many people see as roadblocks to faith.  Strobel begins with just the right tone, an empathetic and poignant interview with elderly skeptic and one-time evangelist, Charles Templeton.  <br />Some of the interviews are pretty good, and all of them have something of value, for those who are looking for it.  I doubt most of the interviewees would call themselves \\"fundamentalists,\\"  as one reviewer describes them; certainly not Catholic philosopher, Peter Kreeft!  Kreeft is generally good on the Problem of Pain, though some of his solutions may seem a bit post hoc to those who do not share Christian assumptions.  Sometimes the honest bewilderment of Job seems preferable to clever philosophical answers.  Not that Kreeft's answers are merely clever; it's a tough question, and there is a lot to what he says.  William Craig is, as always, sharp (on miracles, here) informed about contrary positions, and accustomed to fielding questions in the environment of debates with top skeptics, not just Christian pep rallies, qualifies himself appropriately.  Walter Bradley's discussion of the difficulty of life emerging from non-life was excellent.  I only noticed one lapse.  But it was a major one: he didn't mention the idea of molecular evolution, and Strobel didn't ask.  I'm not sure that's a very good solution, and Bradley's arguments may largely answer it anyway, but not bringing the question up I found rather gauling.  Ravi Zacharius did better than I expected on Jesus being the only way to God.  But while Zacharius gave good general theological answers, and he seems to know Western philosophy fairly well, I didn't see much evidence of deep and sympathetic knowledge of non-Christian religions.  <br />The chapter on church history was, in my opinion, weaker than it should have been, though for a different reason.  John Woodbridge  may be an excellent historian, but he doesn't appear to be an apologist.  He relates the conventional version of what happened, rather than putting events in philosophical and spiritual context.  For example, he mentions the Crusades without explaining the background of Muslim conquests or the reality of Turkic rule, the makeup of the \\"Christian\\" troops sent to the Middle East, or contextual facts such as that Pope Innocent's promise of salvation to fallen warriors was an echo of the Muslim promise, half a millenia earlier, that \\"the way to Paradise is lit by the flash of swords!\\"  The \\"Christianity\\" of the era, in other words, had itself become partly Muslim.  <br />I found Geisler quite disappointing.  His argument that God was being nice when he ordered genocide on the Palestinians was unsatisfactory, to put it mildly.  Better to say you don't understand, and admit perplexity, than to give lame explanations like that.  At least say \\"maybe\\" or \\"the way I see it.\\"  (Richard Wurmbrand, a Christian pastor who was tortured by the communists, writes briefly on the subject with more authority, and empathy.  See In God's Underground.)  Then Geisler claimed that the Fall of man was responsible for animal suffering.  Strobel didn't even ask, \\"What about the millions of fossils of animals we find in layers of rock untroubled by any footprint of man?  Were the effects of the Fall retroactive?\\"  The question glares from the text like a flare.  These lapses were unfortunate, because other things Geisler said could be helpful, if the whole were packaged a little more carefully, and critiqued more thoroughly.  <br />While this book is entitled \\"The Case For Faith,\\" in fact it does not mention a lot of the best evidence for the Christian faith, and is largely defensive in nature.  (Answering objections as much as giving positive arguments.)  While I disagree with some arguments, I think it may be helpful to many people.  As other readers said, it is a generally good introduction to the subject.	2001-07-06
US	50798783	R10NKXZCDD2CON	0449908070	225315262	Jesus: A Life	Books	2	33	46	N	N	Brilliant balderdash.	This book suceeds admirably in capturing is primary subject: its author, A. N. Wilson.  As for Jesus, try another book.<br />Wilson frequently adjusts facts to fit his story line.  Paul's &quot;as though I were a child abnormally born&quot; processes through his imagination and comes out as a confession that Paul's Gospel &quot;is quite different from the beliefs and practices of Jesus' own friends and family.&quot;  (Never mind that he said just the opposite.) He discovers that Jesus had a home, after all, and that Peter &quot;made a substantial profit&quot; in his fish business.  (Perhaps he found a scribal copy of his W-2 form?)<br />Wilson shows little feel for the available evidence from First Century Palestine.  Paul reports that hundreds have seen the risen Christ.  Roman historians do not mention these witnesses, therefore, Wilson deduces, Paul is making it up.  By contrast, when real historians speak of the period, they point out that even for central facts about mainstream Jewish religion, they may  need to rely on reports that are 150 years after the fact.  In such circumstances, making an argument from ignorance (&quot;No confirmation, therefore it must not be true&quot;) is like asking why none of the apostles appeared on Oprah.<br />At times Wilson appears to be competing with Bertrand Russell for who can shock people by saying the silliest bon mot.  &quot;One could name dozens of figures who have been of far greater influence on the human race than Jesus,&quot; Wilson says.  Then he names one dozen, four of whom were deeply committed followers of Jesus, four of whom reacted against Jesus, and all of whom together may or may not have equalled the influence of the Sermon on the Mount.<br />Wilson plays Sherlock Holmes.  &quot;It is a curious number, 500.&quot;  &quot;The devils didn't go out of the demoniac and into the pigs.  No, clearly, his shrieks frightened them,&quot; and they all rushed down the hill and plunged into the lake.  At times like that, he reminds me a bit of Inspector Cleauseau negotiating his way across the lobby of a Swiss hotel.  He doesn't quite know the language, his credentials are mostly bluff, and he asks questions (in a pretentious tone) that are over-clever and under-wise at the same time.  But I grant the spectacle is entertaining.<br />Not that Wilson is a stupid man.  Despite himself (as he says of the Gospel writers), on occasion a snatch of eloquence or even good sense peeps through the bluster.  He speaks of &quot;another layer in (John's) endless layers, another ingrediant in its inexhaustible richness and fascination as a literary text.&quot;  &quot;No saying or story of Jesus can be taken to its logical conclusion without being contradicted by some other saying or fact.&quot;  But then the sun drops behind another cloud of subjectivity and wild imagination.  Perhaps his atheism is partly to blame.  Trying to find a historically and psychologically explanation for the birth of Christianity that fit the materialistic paradigm was one of the great cottage industries of the 20th Century.  Wilson seems to hope that he'll be the lucky one to hit the jackpot.<br />But he lacks the scholarly tools, or temperament, to make a serious attempt.  I read this book just after finishing N. T. Wright's Jesus and the Victory of God, which is a genuine work of scholarship.  By contrast, scholars call Wilson's NT works &quot;wrongheaded and muddled&quot; (Luke Johnson) and &quot;silly and pretentious&quot; (Richard B. Hays).  Wright is also patronizing, but he has some excuse: he really knows something about 1st Century Israel.  The difference is extraordinary.  If you want to learn something about history, read Wright.  If you want a poetic interpretation of Jesus, this book has its moments, but Chesterton's Everlasting Man is superior.<br />My first Wilson biography was of C. S. Lewis.  An aquaintance of Lewis noted that for all Wilson's literary talent, his portrait of the man was &quot;almostunrecognizable.&quot;  Both men were Oxford grads, Anglican and atheist as different times, and talented writers whose native language was English.  Jesus, of course, was different on all counts.  This biography is subjective and mistaken to a corresponding degree -- unless, of course, you read it as an autobiography.<br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Manman was &quot;almost unrecognizable.&quot;  Both men were Oxford grads, Anglican and atheist as different times, and talented writers whose native language was English.

The followers of Fa Lun Gong I have met have seemed nice,(though I don't recall that their skin was &quot;delicate and reddish white&quot;), and it is unfortunate that the Chinese government has treated them with such cruelty.  I don't want to insult or belittle their beliefs, and I certainly respect their fervency.  But to be honest, Master Li strikes me as a religious huckster, selling a typical hodge-podge of Buddhism, Taoism, and folk beliefs, who happened to snag a winning ticket in the lottery of fame.  <br />There is no sign that he suffers from a confidence problem.  &quot;At present, I am the only person genuinely teaching qigong towards high levels,&quot; he claims.  He leaks amazing secrets: &quot;I made a careful investigation once and found that humankind has undergone complete annihilation eighty-one times.&quot;  He claims he &quot;eliminated&quot; a threatening rival in the qigong business, presumably by psychic power.  But I found little of merit in the book -- not that I read every word -- and nothing to make even more modest claims credible.  Master Li says a word in favor of kindness now and then, but nothing profound or challenging, such as you might expect from Confucius or Gandhi.  He offers no deep psychological insights, philosophical clarity, scientific knowledge, or even Zhuang Zi - style stories (Such as the Chinese guru I studied for my MA liked to tell), as far as I could see.  One comment he made did ring true, however:  &quot;Nowadays, sham qigong, phony qigong, and those people possessed by spirits have all made up something at will to deceive people, and their number exceeds that of genuine qigong practices by many times.&quot;  <br />There seems to be a big divide among Asian gurus between the honest and wise, who do not claim any miracles, (the present Dalai Lama even admits he has never so much as seen a miracle) and this other sort, who have nothing to offer but stories, and a few psychic benefits that tend to spring up in theirwake.  But can olives grow on a thistle bush?  When it comes to spiritual matters, stories are no substitute for character.  Reading Zhuan Fa Lun gave me grave reservations about that of Li Hongzhi.       <br />In a recent book, Jesus and the Religions of Man, I spent two chapters discussing the differences between &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic.&quot;  Master Li confirms my objections to the latter category in a striking manner, and I'll probably quote from it in the next edition.  This is a fairly interesting book, if what you want is to get a hang of the more devious sort of Chinese folk religion.	2001-06-25

Political Pilgrims is the amazing story of how Western intellectuals embraced Marxist tyrants at the very moment their colleagues were rotting in prison cells, and the common people everyone claimed to be concerned for, were starving.  The book relates how cultural and religious leaders from the West, including familiar names, visited the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, and other communist countries, and told the most appalling lies to flatter their hosts and express their contempt for Western society.  It is quite an education, as another reviewer put it.  Marx's revolutionary myth dominated history for the better part of the 20th Century, and if we are serious about not repeating the errors of that period, this book should be a part of our education.  The short story Buddha's Smile in Solzhenitsyn's masterpiece, The First Circle, brilliantly tells the same story, from the point of view of Soviet prisoners.  Lewis Feuer's Marx and the Intellectuals compares Marx and Engels themselves with the kind of people Hollander is describing.  I also recommend the writings of the Rumanian philosopher, pastor, and former prisoner, Richard Wurmbrand.<br />Hollander retells George Keenan's story of a Norwegian radical who, when asked what country he most admired, said, \\"Albania.\\"  Keenan noted that the student obviously knew nothing of Albania, but chose that country \\"simply because it seems to be a club with a particularly sharp nail at the end of it with which to beat one's own society.\\"<br />The same reactionary psychology has, it seems to me, been transferred in our day to an uncritical and naive attraction towards what is (simplistically) called \\"eastern religion.\\"  One could write an even longer book about how Westerners project their fantasies on monist ideologies: people like Joseph Campbell and Karen Armstrong \\"explaining\\" human sacrifice, the Theosophical Society standing up for caste, Arthur C. Clarke (Did he know much more of Asian history than the Albanian radical knew of Albania?) describing Buddhism as \\"the only faith that never became stained with blood.\\"  Even Hollander allowed that, \\"While the suspension of disbelief has its place in human life, it belongs more to the religious (or asthetic) than the political realm.\\"  But his book should be read, in my opinion, as a warning against all forms of ideological naivite.

Isobel Kuhn was a Canadian missionary who worked in southern Yunnan province among the Lisu people before and during the second world war.  This is the story of her conversion to Christ as a young woman, and the trials and tests through which she learned to trust in God.  It ends as she heads out to China.  <br />I've read the book several times over the years, and enjoyed it each time.  The book seems to carry a quality of purity and a love for what is good.  Her stories also interest me, I admit, because it parallels my own, geographically.  I'm also from the Northwest, and I have also spent some time in Yunnan Province; two of the most beautiful parts of the world.  The Lisu Christians, who were tested harshly by the Maoist regime, are known to this day for their faith and love, not to mention beautiful singing.  I have had the privilege of meeting some of the people who were influenced by the CIM ministry in that area, including one good friend of Isobel's.  It seems odd to read this book and see how Kuhn's own walk with God once seemed, from a natural perspective, so iffy.  Because of her honesty and willingness to reveal her weaknesses, Kuhn's book is a wonderful testimony to the truth that God has chosen the weak, and the things that are not, to overcome the things that are strong.  The Church in China, including the Lisu church Kuhn worked with, would live by this truth, and prove it true, in an amazing way.  For that story, I recommend Tony Lambert's China's Christian Millions.     <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-06-24

This is a good story.  The author is like a \\"straight man\\" who brings out the flavor of the humorous, eccentric, and poignant personalities with whom he interacts, like rice that gives curry flavor.  The overlapping themes of this book, refugee peoples meeting and finding commonality, Jewish intellectuals seeking to join universal truths to particular traditions, mysticism and the search for meaning, are individually interesting even for someone (like myself) who is neither Jewish nor Buddhist. (\\"I am human, and nothing human is strange to me\\" -- my excuse for giving my two bits.) The themes also blend well into a fascinating narrative. <br />There were points at which I wished the author had thought to ask more probing questions.  For example, the spokesman for the Tibetan government said that if people mix religion and politics, they are the greatest enemy of their own religion.  One would have liked to have someone ask him how this applies to the idea of the Dalai Lama, which has traditionally been about as close a fusion of church and state as you can get.  Kamenetz also accepts the usual black hat -- white hat stereotype of the relationship between Tibet and China.  In that long dance, however, it has often been the Tibetans who trod on Chinese feet, rather than the other way around.  <br />One rabbi compares the Tibetan kuten, or spirit medium, to the Old Testament prophet.  To me, having seen videos of possession in the Tibetan and Chinese traditions, and spirit possession itself in the Chinese tradition, this seems a facile and mistaken comparison.  But such parallels add to the story Kamenetz is telling, and he accepts them with little, if any, critical examination.  Perhaps one problem is he does not know the orthodox tradition well.  <br />Allen Ginsburg sarcastically notes, at one point, that in Asia \\"They have the intelligence to realize there's no God.\\"  Kamenetz is fair-minded enough to find this \\"insulting.\\"  But here again, a little more knowledge of Asian religion would have been helpful.  Ginsburg was even more wrong than he was rude.  Hardly a country in Asia lacks a strong tradition of a High God like Yahweh in many ways.  <br />That's a problem with spiritual tours of this sort.  One needs to be leery of generalizations about Asian religion made by anyone who has not learned the languages and lived among the people for a long time.  Otherwise what you meet is not the other religion itself, but your own culture's projections of the good or bad it would like to see in \\"the other.\\"  <br />I enjoyed this book for the light it shed on contemporary Jewish thinking, and for the story itself.  But when I want to know what Tibetan Buddhists think, I read the Dalai Lama.  Or better yet, I sometimes suspect, his mother.	2001-06-16

It is true that Crossan did not substantially engage many of Craig's arguments for the ressurection.  Instead, he offered orthodox Christians (who presumably have been sheltered from such ideas) a paradigm shift: &quot;It's metaphorical, the Gospel writers didn't really mean it that way.&quot;  True, the debate and essays following do create more of an all-star, rather than world series, atmosphere.  Yet the book does bring together some real stars, and they do put on a good display, in my opinion, baring on the most important spiritual questions we can ask.    <br />Not all of the complaints below need to be taken seriously.  &quot;Buckley was biased.  He called Crossan a puff of smoke.&quot;  Who were you expecting, Barbara Walters?  The man calls his show Firing Line: where there's fire, there's bound to be smoke.  Crossan is a big scholar; he can take care of himself.  &quot;Craig got to go first, and last, too.&quot;  Life is indeed unfair.  Still, what you get here is three top scholars on both sides, each given time to develop their ideas.  Not exactly a kangaroo court.  &quot;They spoke past each other. Crossan said the Gospels are metaphor, and Craig failed to reply.&quot;  Not so.  Crossan advanced his argument explicitly, and Craig even more explicitly refuted it.  Not that it took much refuting.  With the Gospels, it is obvious we're not dealing with Homer or Bunyan: precisely why they continue to cause such a fuss.  <br />Miller wrote an interesting essay on how different an apologetic appears to those &quot;inside&quot; a group as opposed to those &quot;outside.&quot;  I did not find the particular example he gave, of Islamic apologetics, that strong, for the simple reason that from earliest times Islam has held that conversion &quot;out&quot; ws deserving of death.  (The day before I first wrote this, I got an e-mail from a friend in Nigeria about a student of his whose uncle tried to knife him for converting to Christianity.)  In a closed society, your apologetic doesn't have to carry all the weight of persuasion.  (Can you imagine publicly debating the credibility of Muhammed in a Muslim country?)  But even in the case of Humanism, it is striking to me that this debate, in which top scholars attacked a core belief of Christianity, was held in a church, and published by a Christian publisher.  It is also striking that, as Blomberg points out, Crossan shows little or not familiarity with &quot;evangelical&quot; scholarship.  (Unlike, to his credit, Lowder and his Internet Infidel friends.)  Yet the secular media and academic worlds go to the likes of Crossan for expertise, or reassurance, as the case may be.  In which direction, then, should the force of Miller's argument about tunnel vision and self-referential apologetics be turned?  <br />In these discussions, comparative religion is usually brought in as an ally by the skeptical side, as here by Borg and Miller.  But I think it actually offers powerful arguments for the truth of the Gospel.  Those interested in the relationship between Christianity and other religions, and its implications for this discussion, might take a look at my recent book, Jesus and the Religions of Man.	2001-06-03

The Dhammapada possesses a rare quality: the critical reader finds the text he prepares to appraise, evaluating him instead.   &quot;Better than a speech of a thousand vain words is one thoughtful word that brings peace to the mind.&quot;  &quot;Like a flower, full of color but lacking in fragrance, are the words of those who do not practice what they preach.&quot;  &quot;More than those who hate you, an undisciplined mind does greater harm.&quot;  &quot;There is no fire like lust. . . &quot; Of the books I have read in Indian religion, as a Christian, I find this the most spiritually challenging in that regard.<br />I read the text first, and the introduction afterwards.  I thought later it might be good to go through the text twice before the introduction.  While Easwaran gives an eloquent explanation of and apologetic for the Buddha's teachings, he says little about this sutra.  While the Dhammapada speaks extremely well for itself, I would have liked to know more about its origin, how it places in the body of Buddhist literature, and a few other explanations.  Especially, what exactly did the author mean by &quot;selfish attachments?&quot;  Did he think there was another kind?  <br />One thing that stood out for me in this text was the contrast it showed with later Buddhism.  At one point, Easwaran writes, &quot;The joy in (Buddha's) message is the joy of knowing he has found a way for everyone, not just great sages . . . &quot;  The text, however, speaks of the wise looking &quot;upon the suffering multitude as from a mountaintop,&quot; and repeatedly stresses the difficulty of obtaining nirvana.  It stresses the necessity of raising yourself &quot;by your own efforts,&quot; of &quot;cutting down the whole forest&quot; of desire, and of going it alone, if need be, like an elephant in the woods.  How easy Buddha's followers themselves found these teachings can be seen from the later history of monasticism, tantra, Pure Land, and Zen, which incrementally broughtback so much that Buddha got rid of.  I found myself wondering, after reading this text, if anyone has ever lived up to these teachings -- any more than to the Sermon on the Mount, to which it is often compared.  (Though it reminded me more of Proverbs or James -- a clue, perhaps, to its origin.) This contrast makes it is a comfort to me that, contrary to the parallels Easwaran attempts, the early Christians were historians, the Sermon on the Mount is not the whole of their message, and the rest of what they say shows that, in the end, we do not need to save ourselves.  <br />While I disagree with the Buddha's teachings on attachments, karma, reincarnation, and self-salvation, there are many wise sayings in this text that a Christian, as well as a Buddhist, may find worthy of meditation.      <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-05-27

This book is a pretty good way to introduce yourself to many of the most influential thinkers and doers of the Christian tradition.  It's easy to nibble at this salad bar of biographies, and it's easy to become addicted to nibbling.  <br />I have two gripes.  First, a predictable complaint about the choices.  Only two scientists are included (plus Pascal, as an apologist) -- but not Neuton, Kepler, Faraday, Kelvin, or Lister.  At the same time, a few minor characters like William Miller and Aimee McPherson are, apparently to pad the &quot;denominational founders&quot; number.  It is also hard to understand why no Latin Americans, black Africans, Indians, or Chinese (Watchman Nee?  Wang Ming Dao?) made the grade.  Isn't one purpose of this book is to help us Anglo-Saxon Christians become less parochial?  <br />My other complaint is that the authors, or editors, talk down to their readers.  The back cover of the book opens, &quot;If you think history is boring. . . &quot;  Well if I thought that, I wouldn't buy the book.  The authors give less than a page and a half to Francis Bacon, clutter that little space up with irrelevent biographical detail (no doubt to make the story &quot;interesting&quot;), and never get around to telling us why he is worth knowing or what he achieved. <br />Perhaps at times the problem is they lack the necessary breadth of knowledge to tackle some of their subjects.  They give the usual caricature of Pascal as promoting &quot;faith&quot; rather than &quot;reason,&quot; in lieu of the more complex truth, that he wrote of both brilliantly, and did not agree to the conflict that we moderns read into the relationship between the two.  They claim that G. K. Chesterton had no masterpieces -- which made me wonder if they  read or understood Everlasting Man.  <br />The authors present Harriet Beecher Stowe as &quot;the author of Uncle Tom's Cabin,&quot; which they describe as &quot;contrived, unreal,&quot; and &quot;romanticized.&quot;  They fail to mention that the woman did have some real talent; perhaps they didn't notice it.  They also skipped over one of the most attractive qualities of her story, the mutual loyalties between herself, her famous father and brother, and her husband, and how out of the matrix of such personal support that Stowe began to develop, in later life, a Christian feminism rooted in respect between the sexes, that contrasted with the radical feminism of George Elliot, for example.  All that could have been fitted into the white space at the end of Stowe's third page, and made the story much richer. <br />This is a pretty good introductory reference or self-education book for a church or personal library, or as a text for homeschooling.  I did learn a little about a lot of people I wanted to know more of.  But I wish Christian editors would stop dumbing down their books.  What would have been helpful is a bibliography, so readers who catch the passion for history the authors want to promote, could go further with it.  I guess they don't want to tax their readers.<br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-05-21

It was while reading the story of Jorinda and Joringal, a tale not mentioned in this book, that I began to wonder about the spirituality of the Brothers Grimm.  Jorinda, a beautiful maiden, is transformed into a nightinggale and taken captive in a castle by a witch.  One day, her lover, a shepherd, finds a red flower with a drop of dew in the center of it.  When he touches the witch with with the flower, it deprives her of her evil power, and Joringal's beloved is set free.  I had to wonder: &quot;Did the Grimms know they were talking about Jesus?&quot;  Murphy answered this question for me: they did, indeed.  <br />If I were going to pick a word to describe the overall impression the author gives me, I think it would be &quot;kindly.&quot;  At first I sometimes got the feeling I was listening in on someone else's conversation: Murphy forgets his readers and his partners in academic dialogue are strangers, and need to be introduced.  But once everyone is seated for discussion, Murphy is generous not only to the Grimms (he sometimes tells how good a writer Wilhelm is, when he should be showing), he treats other scholars with respect (not a universal habit in academia), and describes the ironic skepticism or sexual crudities of rival versions of these tales without downplaying those approaches, yet bringing out the special depth of the Grimm's mythical imagination and spiritual feeling.  <br />The main subjects of this book are Hansel and Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Cindarella, and Sleeping Beauty.  (But don't overlook Appendix A, a closer look at Wilhelm Grimm's New Testament, or Appendix C, the story of the Cross and the Christmas tree.  It was the star on top of the latter that furnished the fifth star for this rating.) <br />The story Murphy tells is one link in a chain of grace that goes back thousands of years.  Early Christian thinkers saw classical philosophy and myth as a &quot;tutor&quot; to bring the Western world to Christ.  Dante and Michaelangelo picked up on the same theme in the Middle Ages.  G. K. Chesterton described how, as a child, he learned reason and morality, and intimations of spiritual truth, from fairy tales, naming some of the stories in this book, but without talking about Christianity in particular.  Later he wrote a book, Everlasting Man, in which he described pagan mythology in similiar sympathetic terms.  This is the book that helped C. S. Lewis, who would become the most influential Christian writer of the 20th Century, to conclude that the Gospel was the answer to the question, &quot;Where have all the hints of Paganism been fulfilled?&quot;  Later Lewis brought the story full circle with his own redemptive fairy tales, the Chronicles of Narnia.  So the story Murphy tells is of interest historically, as well as for the remarkable light it sheds on our favorite fairy tales.  It is one link in a chain of grace that no man on earth can fully know.  <br />For those interested in the bigger picture, let me recommend some good books: City of God (Augustine); Contra Celsus (Origin); Everlasting Man and Orthodoxy (Chesterton); Eternity in Their Hearts (Don Richardson); Jesus Through the Centuries (Jaroslav Pelikan); The Crown of Hinduism (J.N.Farquhar); and Discovery of Genesis.  (with reservations - see my Amazon review.)  Also, of course, my own books, Jesus and the Religions of Man, and True Son of Heaven: How Jesus Fulfills the Chinese Culture.  <br />My four year old boy spied the cover of this book, with its picture of Snow White and the owl, raven, and dove, and asked for an explanation.  &quot;The prince came and kissed Snow White and she  came back to life,&quot; I told him.  &quot;Is (the prince) God?&quot; He asked.  Murphy shows that the Brothers Grimm still have the power to solicit deep spiritual questions from people of all ages.	2001-05-01

In one of Lewis' Narnia books, he describes a quiet, restful place called The Wood Between the Worlds, where &quot;You can almost hear the trees growing.&quot;  Reading Lewis at his best, you can almost hear the spirit growing, taking up water through its roots in God.  <br />I can't say how much I've learned from this beautiful little treasure.  Reading it for the first time twenty or more years ago, each chapter struck me as a revelation, and has been a part of the &quot;spiritual furniture of my mind&quot; ever since.  (Though living up to it is more difficult.)  It gives me food for thought on &quot;like&quot; and &quot;love,&quot; how to treat animals, the beauties and dangers of friendship and romance, how they differ, the inherent riskiness of love, the disquises by which hatred can enter the soul, and what it means to love God and for God to love me.  I do not agree with Gross above that this book is a more &quot;persuasive apologetic&quot; for Christianity than his other books, but I do think that non-Christians are likely to enjoy it.  M. Scott Peck's books, Road Less Travelled and People of the Lie, (the first written as a Buddhist, the second as a Christian) can even be read as &quot;case studies&quot; of some of the points Lewis makes here.   <br />Four Loves proves that the most eloquent and deepest truths can be expressed in the simplest language.  It (they?) would be a wonderful gift for a newlywed, a young person graduating from high school or college, or anyone else to whom you wish to express your love.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-04-28

I ordered several books on the Crusades for a research project I conducted last year, and this may have been the most interesting.  Maalouf describes the book as a &quot;true life novel,&quot; and he does indeed succeed in depicting the characters, European and Middle Eastern, in all their bumbling, hopeful, fracticious, murderous, and occasionally heroic or far-seeing humanity.  The main body of the book is divided into six parts entitled &quot;invasion,&quot; &quot;occupation,&quot; &quot;riposte,&quot; &quot;victory,&quot; &quot;reprieve,&quot; and &quot;expulsion,&quot; and each section is full of freshly personal details.  In part this is the story of a religious invasion and its repulsion, in part, of the education of a group of European semi-barbarians, and in part, a mixing of two cultures both with something to learn from the other.    <br />At the end is added an interesting epilogue in which Maalouf offers lessons to be learned, about pluralism and prosperity and about openness to ideas from other societies.  As a scholar of East Asia, I immediately recognized in his arguments the contrary stories of Japan and China in the 20th Century.  <br />No one should take this book as the story of the Crusades; Maalouf is in part trying to balance the more common &quot;Western&quot; viewpoint.  He begins the story with the &quot;invasion&quot; of the &quot;Franj;&quot; but of course that invasion was, from the point of view of the Franks, a counter-offensive.  But within the limits the author has set, this is an excellent, helpful and fascinating piece of historical reconstruction.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-04-23
US	50798783	R3KO0RFXM8POPJ	1574532642	303272798	The Upanishads	Books	5	66	84	N	N	Brilliant.  Is it true?	The Upanishads are a remarkable collection of mystical literature  that represent a turning point in Indian thought.  Eswaran tranlates the most famous of them into strikingly simple and resonant language.  &quot;Freed from sin, as a snake sheds its sin, They see the Supreme Lord, who lives in all.&quot;  &quot;As the sun, who is the eye of the world, Cannot be tainted by the defects in our eyes. . . So the one self, dwelling in all, cannot be tainted by the evils of the world.&quot;  &quot;The tree of Eternity has its roots above and its branches on earth below.  Its pure root is Brahman the immortal From whom all the worlds draw their life. . . &quot; <br />Each of the main Upanishads is given a short and helpful introduction, then followed by a few pages of notes.  The text as a whole is again bracketed by eloquent essays by Easwaran and Michael Nagler, who make helpful comparisons to Augustine, Pascal, Gandhi, the Rig Veda, the Gita, and Einstein, building bridges to readers of various traditions and interests.  All in all, Easwaran has gone the extra mile to help his readers comprehends the message of the Upanishads, as he understands it.<br />It may be that clarity is sometimes achieved at the cost of strict accuracy.  Eswaran admits &quot;simplifying&quot; the text in certain ways -- cutting what he thinks repetitive, using &quot;Lord of Love&quot; dozens of times to translate a term that in a note toward the end he admits means &quot;God-self-energy.&quot;  I lost a little confidence in the translation after reading that.  Also, he translates &quot;atman&quot; as &quot;Self,&quot; a term some people seem to think is not quite right.  So while I enjoyed this version, I plan to compare it to others for scholarly purposes.<br />Nagler made a few comments both on the Upanishads and on Christianity that made me question his clarity of vision a bit.  His claim that, aside from Augustine, &quot;the shapers of early Christianity&quot; believed there was &quot;no high task of self-sacrifice left for people to perform,&quot; seemed an odd thing to say of a religion whose primary texts are full of advice like, &quot;Take up your cross and follow me,&quot; and &quot;Make your life a living sacrifice,&quot; and whose early followers have been blamed for being too eager for martyrdom.  <br />Given the fact that some experience the &quot;I am that&quot; state yet reject it as an illusion, should we believe what the mystics experienced as true?  What social, psychological, and moral affect did the &quot;inward turn&quot; that this text represents have on Indian society?  One feels a bit crass or, well, unenlightened, to pose doubtful such questions in the face of such beautiful poetry.  But I think they are also worth posing.  Anyone who would like to consider these questions from the point of view of a knowledgable and fair-minded Christian, read The Crown of Hinduism, by F. N. Farquhar, or the more critical (and passionate) books by Indian social reformer, Vishal Mangalwadi, such as Truth and Social Justice or The World of Gurus.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-04-20

I remember noticing the essay on which this book was based, in an international newspaper several years ago.  Though I knew nothing of the author at the time, I don't think it took me more than a paragraph or two to realize, first, &quot;This is a major argument,&quot; second, &quot;It has some validity,&quot; and third, &quot;This is going to make a lot of people mad.&quot;  The book is, of course, far more nuanced and detailed than the article.  I do not agree with every point Professor Huntington makes, but it certainly carries through on the promise of those first few paragraphs.  This book is one strong and rather iconoclastic model by which to understand international relations in the coming years.  Even if you disagree with it, or find it offensive, this is definitely a book worth reading, or if you're a teaching, assigning your students to read and attack or defend.  <br />I do not think some attacks below (not all really arguments) on Huntington's approach to Islam were quite fair.  I didn't see anything &quot;pathological&quot; or &quot;paranoid&quot; about his arguments, and he explicitly stated, time and time again, that Islam was not at all &quot;monolithic.&quot;  Actually, I think he is sometimes overly cautious and understated on the subject, in effect making all kinds of excuses for the militant character of Islam, and holding out the hope that it will mellow.  Anyone who knows how Islam is perceived by non-Muslims in sub-Saharan Africa, India, or China, or is aware of the military career of Mohammed, can only be amazed how prevalent p.c. attempts to deny the obvious seem to be.  (A phenomena we have seen with other absolutist idealogies.)  Instead of trying to browbeat anyone who tells the truth about Islamic militarism and lack of freedom, why don't Muslim intellectuals change the realities?  (If they can.) <br />It is true, Huntington did not clearly define what he meant by &quot;civilization.&quot;  It seems odd to designate countries that havebeen taught atheism for eighty years, &quot;Orthodox,&quot; for example.  But I think the basic categories are sound, however we quibble about semantics.  I see the relationship between China and the West as more ambivalent, though, in other words more potentially positive, than Huntington.  (I wrote a book, True Son of Heaven, which describes common links between Chinese and Christian thought.)  While Huntington discusses other variables, one of the main assumptions of this book is that powers clash.  He generally seems to avoid dogmatism on the nature or intensity of the clash.  So I agree that some tension in the relationships he describes is fairly inevitable, though I by no means ascribe to Real Politic or any deterministic or cynical view of human relations.  <br />Agree or disagree, Huntington's is a thesis that deserves careful consideration.  It contains some hard truths, but as the Preacher said, &quot;Faithful are the wounds of a friend; profuse are the kisses of an enemy.&quot;    <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man /  d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2001-04-07

A young school teacher in a small Chinese town fails an exam, has a breakdown, reads a Christian tract, tries to conquer China under the impression that he is God's second son (after Jesus), and almost overthrows the Qing Dynasty.  If you ever doubted that &quot;fact is stranger than fiction,&quot; read this story.  <br />God's Chinese Son is one of several histories of the Taiping Rebellion I read in grad school.  My personal favorite was Vincent Shih's The Taiping Ideology (which related TP thought to Confucianism, the ancient worship of Heaven, and prior ideological revolutions.  Shih was also the only &quot;major&quot; historian who didn't clumsily mistake TP for a &quot;form of Christianity,&quot; for which I was grateful.)  But probably Spence gave the best overall introduction to the movement.  I found this book fairly lively, and was fascinated by his description of popular religion in Southern China.  (Which may seem familiar in Taiwan or Fujian to this day.)   <br />Spence makes a perfunctory attempt to justify his cheeky title by linking Hong to Jesus in the introduction.  This attempt falls flat, in my opinion: Spence doesn't appear to know much about NT Christianity.  A better comparison, I think, would be to Mormonism.  I found eighteen similarities between the two movements, and my professor, a Qing historian, told me that in his classes on Qing history, Mormon students often noticed some of these things as well.  I would also argue that the TP movement had more in common with Islam and Marxism than with NT Christianity. <br />One benefit of learning about the Tai Ping Rebellion (and other such movements in China) is that it helps one understand the modern Chinese reaction to Fa Lun Gong.  Actually, there are quite a few sects in modern China that show revolutionary potential, that the government has tried to suppress -- a  traditional function of government in China.  Ironically, of course, the Marxist government itself came to power in a similar way, and with similar goals, as the TP.  So this is a good book to begin understanding a neglected, but very influential, element of Chinese history and culture.  The TP story also provides an interesting parallel to the modern spread of Christianity in China.  (&quot;Western religion&quot; does better in China when it's not being preached by Westerners.)  Finally, God's Chinese Son is a remarkable though tragic story in and of itself, and as one reviewer said, it ought to be better known.     <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man / d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2001-04-02

As a non-Catholic Christian, I was happy to find that I agree with most of this book.  (Apart from the &quot;Mother of God&quot; chapter.)  I was impressed by the intelligence, simplicity, and balance with which Pope John-Paul presented his ideas.  It seemed to me that the pope must be aware of the ideas of great Christian thinkers like Lewis, Chesterton, and Pascal, and shares the same ability to express deep truths in terms that are easy to understand.  <br />Some Buddhists, like Thich Nhat Hanh, have complained about the Pope's view of other religions.  Thich actually rebuked the Pope for misunderstanding Christianity by calling Jesus &quot;the only mediator between God and man!&quot;  Non-Christians should realize that, in this case, the Pope is only quoting Scripture.  And as he also noted, Christianity &quot;rejects nothing that is true and holy in these religions.&quot;  My own research is into what the Pope calls &quot;semina Verbi,&quot; seeds of truth, in pre-Christian cultures, (especially Asian) and I thought his approach was fair.  Of course he talks about many issues in this book: the fall of communism, abortion, the status of women, salvation, the existence of God. . . and does not go into any in great detail.  It is an excellent book to read for an overall understanding of Catholic Christianity and the thinking of one very thoughtful Catholic in particular.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-03-26

To put it bluntly, this was one of the silliest books I have ever read.  To disentangle the whole web of fallacy, error, and pure nonsense that is Freke and Gandy's argument, would be like puting a bowl of spaghetti back into the package, minus meatballs and sauce.  Let me just straighten out a few of many messes:   <br />1. First, the authors call the Nag Hammadi manuscripts a &quot;whole library&quot; of Gospels, and ask, &quot;Why hasn't every Christian rushed out to read these newly discovered words of the Master?&quot;  The obvious answer is, those of us who have read some of them, find nothing like the Gospels, or words of Christ at all.  Rather, we find weakly disguised didactic fiction.  (Very much like the alleged sayings of Confucius in the Daoist anthology called the Zhuang Zi.)  As for the Gospels themselves, it is obvious to any experienced and sensible reader that at their core, at least, they are quite unlike Gnostic or any other ancient fiction.  In reference to ancient Near Eastern literature, skeptic A. N. Wilson calls them &quot;a unique literary genre.&quot;  In reference to ancient and medieval fiction, C. S. Lewis (&quot;The best-read man of his generation&quot;) wrote of John, &quot;I have been reading poems, romances, vision-literature, legends, myths, all my life.  I know what they are like.  I know that not one of them is like this.&quot;  In my reading of Eastern religious texts, I find the same.  This book is based on the inability of Freke and Gandy to even notice the most obvious qualities of the books they attempt to refute -- the flare for reality in the Gospels.<br />2.  To maintain their skepticism, the authors stack the deck relentlessly.  They appear to have read no modern Christian writers at all.  When the text reads, &quot;scholars think,&quot; check end notes, and you find someone like Pagels or Wells.  They've probably never heard of William Lane Craig, Gary Habermas, or N. T. Wright.  John Crossan is too reactionary to gracethe pages of this masterpiece.  <br />Jesus Mysteries is kind of a geological column of arguments against Christianity from bygone eras.  No, the Dark Ages were not caused by the victory of Christianity, but by a centuries-long decline in population that early Christianity began to reverse before the barbarians invaded.  (See Stark, the Rise of Christianity.)  (The author's fantasize that, apart from Christianity, the Mysteries would have encompassed the Roman empire.  More likely, I think, we might have wound up with something like the bhakti (devotional) cults of India, amidst a sea of Advetic (or neo-Platonic) philosophy -- and then invasion and lights out.)  <br />The authors' treatment of Augustine is symptomatic.  Augustine is universally acknowledged as one of the great thinkers in human history.  The translators of the Upanishads quote his insights.  Steven Hawking and Paul Davies describe him as the first person to realize that time was created with the universe.  Many find in his writings &quot;a depth of psychological insight unsurpassed in the Western world.&quot;  But to Freke and Gandy, Augustine was just another of the bigots and simpletons of the 4th Century orthodox church.  Freke and Gandy are like men who go into a mine of diamonds and rubies, and come out with lumps of coal.  No, check the end notes, and I find out they never went into the mine at all.  They've been panning other peoples' talings, never read Augustine for themselves.  Amazing.  <br />3. Using the methods of Freke and Gandy, I could &quot;prove&quot; that Christianity arose from Vedic Hinduism, Chinese tradition, or Southeast Asian minority cultures like the Jiang, Wa, or Dai, or that Lincoln or Gandhi never lived.  (See Jesus and the Religions of Man.)<br />4. Freke and Gandy sort early Christians into two simple groups, literalists (black hats) and Gnostics (white hats).  Paul and Clement go in the Gnostic camp.  People may have been reading them for centuries without realizingthey rejected the historicity or physical resurrection of Jesus.  But Freke and Gandy have a special flare for such breakthroughs, like a magic lantern that cuts through all the scholarship.  <br />5. Finally, Freke and Gandy attack a Christianity they simply don't understand.  They take Justin Martyr's argument that similarities between Christianity and paganism were invented by the devil as the definitive Christian solution.  They never honestly deal with what I call the &quot;fulfillment model,&quot; or the Catholic church calls &quot;semina Verbi,&quot; (From Justin Martyr!  The one thing of value that I gained from this book, was that it encouraged me to read him for myself.  Don't accept anything in this book as true until you've checked original sources -- or at least real scholars!)  <br />Jesus said, &quot;I have come not to do away with the Law and the Prophets, but to fulfill.&quot;  John, Paul, Justin, Clement, Origin, Augustine, Dante, Michaelangelo, G. K. Chesterton, the present Pope, even the Brothers Grimm, all describe Christianity not as a repudiation of the best things in paganism, but as myth and dream become reality.  In Lewis' words, &quot;The question was no longer to find the one simply true religion among a thousand religions simply false. It was. . . 'Where have the hints of all Paganism been fulfilled?'&quot;  This is the orthodox Christian paradigm.  The authors never substantially engage it, and seldom show they have so much as heard of it.     <br />In relating Christianity to mystery religions, the authors have got hold a bit of the truth.  But they are like the blind men who feel the trunk of the elephant and think they have a snake.  Mohammed described Jesus as the greatest prophet. Buddhists see him as a Zen teacher or bodhisattva, Marxists as a revolutionary, Jews, a teacher of wisdom, and Hindus, the Sanatan Sadguru or an avatar like Krishna or Ram.  What do you get when you add all the pictures together?  Let me recommend threebooks that consider this question from a broader perspective:  The Crown of Hinduism, Eternity in Their Hearts, and my own book, Jesus and the Religions of Man.  <br />The authors say of early Christianity, that it would accomplish things no one &quot;could have imagined at the time.&quot;  Yet the early Christians did imagine it.  When it was still a minor Hebrew sect, they imagined it changing the world.  Isn't it just possible they knew something Freke and Gandy don't?  <br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2001-03-26
US	50798783	R217POOGDB728N	1566390818	874978260	The Case Against Christianity	Books	3	82	138	N	N	Nice try, but no cigar.	This book is a well-written and systematic argument against the Christian faith, mostly from the point of view of Biblical criticism and philosophy.  Martin's his writing is disciplined and readable, though not as lyrical as, say, Bertrand Russell.  Unlike some skeptical writers, he has done a bit of homework, quoting Plantinga, Habermas, and Kierkegaard, for example.  (Though he seems to have missed some others that he really should have read.) His tone is fairly genial.  <br />Martin's argumentative method is to throw lots of arguments up and see what sticks.  (Could the resurrection be caused by the indetermidacy principle of quantum physics?  Or by Resurrecting Finite Miracle Workers (RFMW)?) The more you know about the subjects he covers, however, the less seems to stick.  And the more slides off, the more you wonder if Martin has got some of the mud in his own eyes. <br />Martin's first main argument, against the historicity of Jesus, is so weak, and Martin appears to unconscious of that weakness, that it undermines his credibility.  He'll start an argument with, &quot;Some scholars believe. . . &quot; and end it (same sentence) &quot;clearly, then. . .&quot; What kind of argument is that?  An argument is not as strong as the sum of its dependant clauses!  A piece of speculation (often very wild) by an unnamed &quot;scholar&quot; seems to set up like concrete in Martin's mind in the space of a few clauses into fact.  If my father built houses that way, he would have gotten into a lot of trouble during the recent earthquake in Seattle!  <br />Argument from silence is another of Martin's favorite weapons.  &quot;Surely if X believed or knew Y he would have said so.&quot; Generally speaking, though, the argument from silence is a logical fallacy, because you cannot infer that an event did not happen because someone failed to mention it! Also, the epistles to which Martin appeals in this regard, are short and on other subjects. (Such as Christian living.) In any case, the Gospels do relate Jesus' life.  Many wise and literary Christian scholars (Lewis, Polkinghome, Chesterton, Per Beskow) and even many non-Christians, have repeatedly pointed out the characteristics of the Gospels that mark them as historical.  But Martin does not seem aware of these arguments, or of the qualities in the Gospel that make them credible, at the least.  <br />Martin believes that the differences among the Gospel accounts of the resurrection are a strong argument against it.  What do you think skeptics would say if they agreed on all points?  &quot;Conspiracy!&quot; And rightly so. As prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi said of the Manson case, when the killers prepared beforehand what to say, &quot;The stories tallied perfectly,&quot; But when you have honest witnesses, &quot;There will always be left over evidence that just doesn't fit.&quot; And the prosecutor in the Columbine case said, &quot;Any time you have a tramautic situation, even if only one person is killed, every testimony is different.&quot; So it appears to many that the superficial differences, but underlying agreement, of the NT records, are very impressive evidence for the truth of the resurrection.  But Martin does not even consider this possibility.<br />Martin's argument against Paul's testimony that 500 witnesses to the resurrection were mostly still alive, was breathtaking.  &quot;The fact that 500 people reported seeing a resurrected man would surely have attracted wide attention and come to the attention of. . . historians.&quot; Therefore, since we didn't have any clear secular references to that, this report must be false, and Paul an unreliable witness!  This is only a touch less ludicrous than Jesus Mysteries, that argues against the existence of Jesus since Roman historians don't mention him much, and then turns around and notes that they don't say much about Christians at all until 250 A. D.!  But if the community itself was ignored when it had hundreds of thousands of members, why should a single incident within that community be recorded when the membership was still just a few thousand?  In fact, from my studies in China I know that remarkable things can happen among a disfavored group (Christians, again) with little or no mention of those events in the press.  From many such specious arguments, Martin proves to his own satisfaction that the Gospels are unreliable, but to mine that (at least) he is out of the loop when it comes to evidence about historical matters.  <br />If you want philosophy, Martin might help a bit more, but even here I think some of his arguments rather contrived.  For example, I guess the tension Smith describes between Scripture and theory of salvation arises because he is concerned with philosophizing about salvation for others, rather than gaining it for himself.  But the Bible explicitly limits itself to aiding in the latter, not the former, enterprise.  And Martin has overlooked other Scriptural principles on this topic, such as that we are judged by the light given us, and that God, not man, is the judge.  Martin might have come to a better understanding of the issue by reading C. S. Lewis' Great Divorce.  It is a pity that he nowhere mentions the most influential Christian thinker of the 20th Century, and unfortunate for his argument. If you're in the market for arguments against Christianity, what you get here for the most part is quality in terms of style, but mostly just quantity as to substance.	2001-03-22

I.Packer, Charles Colson, George Sayer, James Houston, Don Bede Griffiths and Others	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Like a brownie: hard to resist one last crumb!	I've always been a bit surprised and suspicious of the C. S. Lewis industry:  the fact that I like reading Lewis, doesn't mean I like reading about him.  (Though, if push comes to shove, I have to admit I do.  Just no slobbering, please.) Fortunately this is a collection of essays by colleagues, students, and friends of Lewis who, even while writing about Lewis, have other things on their minds -- the purpose of English teaching, Oxford,  redemption, even (in the gardener's case) his own bad jokes.  There are even a few critical stories.  Most of the essays are well written and insightful, and gave plenty of Boswell-like anecdotes not only of Lewis, but of other peculiar denizens of Oxford as well.  Graham could have saved himself the occasional bone thrown to evangelicals, though, as far as I'm concerned.  I really don't care how Bob Jones reconciles the work of the Holy Spirit and beer.  Billy Graham and J. I. Packer didn't seem to have much to say.  Also, the editor protested a bit too much about &quot;hero worship.&quot;  There's no need to apologize for this book, otherwise.    <br />The book arrived in the mail on Friday afternoon.  By Saturday afternoon I was chewing on crumbs.  <br />To me, one of the most interest comments was the suggestion by one writer that Lewis had been influenced by the marvellous chapter &quot;The Ethics of Elfland&quot; in G. K. Chesterton's Orthodoxy.  I am beginning to suspect that Wilhelm Grimm was a very clever, and also successful, evangelist, and that there might be a secret link between the Seven Dwarves and Trumpkin.    <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-03-17

Long-winded and eloquent, tender and cynical, passionate and sane, Victor Hugo made literature by adding to life, rather than subtracting from it.  Hugo sees life from many sides.  He finds good in the revolution and the monarchy, the priest and the skeptic, but also roots of evil in each.  Hugo is Humanist and Christian, pious and scornful, lover and long-winded story-teller whose acquaintance one does well to cultivate on a rainy day.<br />He is also preachy.  This book is a series of sermons sandwiched between narrative.  He is a poet who inflicts on his readers a maddening romantic history of the Paris sewer at a critical point in the plot.  Like Dickens, his coincidences defy all plausible odds.  I felt like docking Hugo a star for all these forms of &quot;extravagence,&quot; but then decided, in the spirit of romanticism, to add an extra five and then take them away again, leaving a full complement.  Only a person who has failed to grasp this book's essential greatness would discount it on account of such failings.  Even the demerits of a work like this add something to its beauty, like the coloring in smoky quartz.<br />Hugo excells in description of character, mood, and aphorism.  Here are a few of the latter: &quot;The girl who knows herself to be pretty is less likely to become a nun, the sense of vocation varying inversely with the degree of beauty.&quot; &quot;Skepticism, that dry-rot of the intellect, had left him without a whole thought in his head.&quot; &quot;Two riches which the rich often lack -- work, which makes a man free, and thought, which makes him worthy of freedom.&quot;  &quot;They made the fatal blunder of mistaking the discipline of the soldier for the consent of the nation.  These are the delusions that destroy thrones.&quot;<br />I took Hugo with me on a trip to China, and found him a very good traveling companion...	2001-03-11

Lewis once wrote, &quot;For many healthy extroverts, self-examination first begins with conversion.  For me it was the other way around. . . I had been 'taken out of myself.'&quot;  While it would be innaccurate to call Dr. Nathanson a &quot;healthy extrovert&quot; before he became a Christian, this is the story of an abrasive and self-centered man who, coming into the presence of God, became more aware of what was within.  He is almost painfully honest in telling what he found and why it troubled, and continues to trouble, him.  The book's confessionary ending reminds the reader that the spiritual journey, like a human partnership, only begins when one steps up to the altar.  Perhaps the opposite delusion, our demand for instant gratification, pay-off without investment, is one fault behind American acceptance of cheap grace, fast food, divorce, and abortion alike.  <br />While the Hand of God is first of all a contemporary spiritual pilgrimage, it is also a book that anyone who is at all open-minded about abortion should read and carefully consider.  Dr. Nathanson has looked at abortion from both sides, now: he knows very well what he is talking about.  So it is a pity there are so few reviews of this book here, including the kind of  attacks from hostile reviewers that show a point has sunk in, or that a book has sold beyond its narrowest constituency.  This is a book more people ought to read.  I might add that it is well-written and full of surprising and sometimes rather contrarian observations.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2001-03-11

I can't believe I more-or-less read this whole book in a single day.  It's not, in the ordinary sense, a page-turner.  You would expect an English prof to makes things more interesting than this, but in fact the book is often stilted, repetitive, and a bit pompous, not to mention dry.  The author gives you little feel for place or time, or even demographic detail.  (How many people lived in these towns he's talking about?)  And all his references to the Bible seemed very ignorant.  One of the odd things about the Salem trial to me, as a Christian, is that there are no strong parallels to these events in the Bible itself.  Another interesting paradox, that the author does bring up, is that the pastors in Salem were mostly against the trials.  I was hoping to learn fomr about where the Puritans got their ideas about the devil in the first place, and how they reconciled those ideas with the Bible, but no such information was forthcoming here.<br />Still, if you want to sort out facts in regard to what happened in Salem, and why, this is a very useful resource.  The book is thoughtful, somewhat perceptive, and thoroughly researched.  (In terms of American history.)  In a book I wrote last year, Jesus and the Religions of Man, I included an appendix, &quot;Crusades, Inquisitions, Pograms, and Witch Hunts,&quot; relying on another source for the pages on the Salem witch trials.  I now discover, thanks to Professor Rosenthal, that I made a mistake or two (nothing vital) by not having read this book first.  This is not such a bad book as some of the reviewers below make out; if you skip a bit, it can be valuable and somewhat interesting.  But don't mistake it for a Stephen King novel.	2001-03-10

A leading quantum chemist said that during a trip to Australia he had been told, &quot;Everyone in Sydney has bought a copy of A Brief History of Time, and some claim to have read it.&quot;  I borrowed this book from a colleague heading back to his home in Sydney, who didn't claim to have read it.  It is an ambitious book: a cutting edge scientist explains the history of physics and the universe to ordinary folks.  Hawking more or less pulls it off: while there were a few stretches that I can only pretend to have read, overall I found it understandable and often humorous.  (I loved the 2-D dog with the bone in this stomach and the digestive tract that cuts him in two.)  It took longer to read than books twice its size, which suggests that modern physics theories themselves can warp the fabric of space-time.<br />Despite Hawking's conclusion that philosophers &quot;have not been able to keep pace&quot; with physics and have nothing left to do but play word games, some still have interesting things to say about the Big Questions.  William Lane Craig, for example, is full of suggestions about how Hawking can improve his metaphysics, if not his physics.  We're all so used to hearing strange things from physicists that when Hawking tells us we may be living in imaginary time and real time is imaginary it seems par for the course . . . But I know of at least one top physicist who finds it as far-fetched as it sounds to the naive layman.  Hawking's is a more genial and attractive agnosticism (or deism) than that of his childhood hero, Bertrand Russell.  (Who said, &quot;There is no evidence of design about the universe.&quot;)  It would be hard for a physicist to maintain that, anymore, thanks in part to Hawking's own discoveries.  So Hawking tries to slip down the rabbit hole with his watch into the Wonderland of &quot;imaginary time&quot; at the end of the book.  I have to think Somebody Up There has a sense of humor.<br />Francis Bacon, who did quite a bit to set this grand scientific enterprise in motion, was fond of quoting the Biblical passage, &quot;It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, but it is the glory of the King to find a thing out.&quot;  The history Hawking gives here is indeed glorious.  But the reader should also consider Bacon's prayer that from &quot;the increase of natural light&quot; there arise no spiritual &quot;darkness.&quot;  Hawking's understanding of the universe, while useful and instructive, seems to be, in a sense, a matter of attention strongly focused in one direction.<br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Manis grand scientific enterprise in motion, was fond of quoting the Biblical passage, &quot;It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, but it is the glory of the King to find a thing out.&quot;  The history Hawking gives here is indeed glorious.

It is a story about five Japanese, strangers to one another, who travel to India in search of something -- not quite sure of what.   <br />Endo is also addressing, in story as people like Huston Smith have in essay, one of the great questions of our time: &quot;How do the religions of mankind fit together?&quot;  The title of the book refers to the Ganges River, which as Endo describes is full of filth.  The edition I read, ironically, featured a clear mountain spring on the cover.  Endo's work has the merit, over Smith's famous descriptions of human religions, that it takes the surface ugliness and filth of religion seriously.  At the same time, the depths of the book remain somewhat murky, as in fact does the question about religions, and the existence and character of God.  <br />I was on my first and only visit to India during the period Endo describes in this novel.  We were in New Delhi at the time, when the city became a war zone between Hindus and Sikhs.  After the battle died down, I remember seeing a sign strung across a major thoroughfare:  &quot;We thank our Hindu brothers who saved the lives of their Sikh brothers.&quot;  Clearly, the Good Samaritans of this world are not limited to one tradition -- that is why Jesus made his hero a Samaritan.  Endo, in effect, retells Jesus famous story, at a place and time that adds a great deal of drama and suggestive meaning to the telling.  <br />Endo does not appear to be aware of the best and most orthodox Christian solution to how faith traditions fit together, unfortunately.  Like Smith and most modern writers, he never considers what I call the &quot;fulfillment model.&quot; Jesus said, &quot;I have not come to do away with the Law and the Prophets. . . I have come to fulfill.&quot;  Great Christian thinkers like Paul, Clement, Origin, Augustine, Dante, Chesterton, and Lewis, have applied this approach to non-Christian cultures and come up withsome amazing insights.  In the context of Hinduism, I wish in particular Endo had read J. N. Farquhar's The Crown of Hinduism.  That might have helped him see that the more one understands and loves the good things in Hindu (or Japanese or American) culture, the more one sees how Jesus becomes a &quot;fount of living water&quot; that deepens the holiest, and purifies the murkiest, of every stream of human spirituality.   <br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man<br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2001-02-11

It may take time, and bad things may happen in the interum. (Marx, Freud, Tylor, Mead, etc.) But in the end, the priests of the high religion called science often move, in crab-like fashion, towards what the rest of us knew all along.  (The universe did have a beginning!  Men and women are different!  Faith in God is good for the soul!)  This book represents a sometimes grudging but often gracious step in that direction, towards treating human beings as responsible agents, as well as victims of prior causes.<br />Peck tells the stories of a number of patients tinged with or affected by &quot;evil&quot;.  These stories are the heart of the book, and are well-told and fascinating.  The dialogues remind me of a book Peck recommends, The Great Divorce, by C. S. Lewis.  Lewis would have added that these stories are in the end about the dangers each of us face within ourselves, and Peck may have that in mind as well.<br />The reviewer from Greece who suggests that Peck is wrong to &quot;label&quot; people as &quot;evil,&quot; has, I think, missed the point.  Evil is an adjective, not a noun.  The whole purpose of the book is to find a &quot;cure&quot; for a condition, not to banish human beings like demons from our midst.  I don't know how the reader would suggest &quot;curing&quot; evil if she conceives of it as an ailment, but certainly that notion has proved dangerous, too!  To deny our ability to do wrong is to deny our humanity; it is refreshing to see someone who calls himself a scientist take human choice seriously.<br />As for a cure for evil, a fascinating companion to this book would be Underground Saints, the account by the Rumanian Messianic pastor, Richard Wurmbrand, of his years as a prisoner in Romanian prison camps.  (Especially his stories of the conversion of mass-murderers and the like.)  <br />The final chapter, where Peck goes from conclusions based on his own work with patients, to discuss exorcism (!) and &quot;group evil,&quot; are naturally the most controversial.  I am not sure what to make of his observations about demon possession, which do not exactly square with any orthodoxy, especially any scientific orthodoxy.  In chapter 7 Peck points out that &quot;we scientists&quot; are not immune to &quot;jumping to conclusions&quot; on subjects they do not know.  This statement is, ironically, sandwiched between discussions in which Peck ventures into international politics, where he clearly does not belong.  Oh well.  If Peck were not one to overreach himself, we wouldn't have the rest of the book.  And it is worth having.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2001-02-04

Lewis' skeptical biographer, A. N. Wilson, acknowledging his wit, thought Lewis' parodies cruel.  But is it cruel to warn of the corruption of the soul, in a way that might lead to healing?  We may see the characters described here in the &quot;real world&quot; around us.  Lewis is hoping, of course, that we will recognize some shadow of ourselves, and recognize our need of God's help in attaining freedom.    <br />Lewis warns in the preface that his purpose is not to promote speculation about the nature of heaven and hell.  Still, the book is very thought-provoking on that count as well.  This book might be helpful to someone who is trying to reconcile the love of God with the Christian doctrine of hell, as it was to M. Scott Peck, for example.  <br />A few days ago I saw an interview of a great character actress who, when asked what she would like to hear God say when she arrived at the gate of heaven, replied, &quot;Everybody in.&quot;  The audience applauded loudly.  Lewis, noting the remark of Milton's devil that it is &quot;better to reign in hell than serve in heaven,&quot; in effect poses the question, &quot;What if not everybody wants in?&quot;  Or as Jesus put it, what if, when the invitation to the wedding of the Lamb arrives at our door, we are busy with livestock and real estate transactions, and we decide to stay home?	2001-01-30

Don't pay any attention to the person below who thinks O'Flaherty should have translated the Rig Veda according to its &quot;spiritual&quot; meaning. As the oldest Hindu scripture, and as a book that contains a lot of symbol and mystery, people have been inclined for millenia to read things into this set of poems . . . caste, reincarnation, later ideas about God.  O'Flaherty seems to be doing her best to offer an honest selection of what the authors really intended, to &quot;get out&quot; what they put in -- though of course following her own interests to some extent.   <br />In this selection, you find creation poems, a fair but managable set of poems on sacrifice (which I believe is the dominant theme of the larger work), poems to Agni, Soma, Inda, Veruna, and other gods, and some thematic choices, on death and women, for examples.  The text is readable, though some of the footnoting seems a bit pedantic.  <br />As a Christian interested in comparative religion, I find the Rig Veda very interesting.  J. N. Farqurhar argues, in The Crown of Hinduism, that the Veda is actually closer to Christianity than to modern Hinduism in some ways, in that 1) The early idea of Varuna, as Creator, Sustainer, Ruler, and identified with the Law, is more like Yahweh than the conception of Brahman that appears in the Upanishads. 2) The theme of sacrifice.  3) The Vedic idea of heaven.  4) The unambiguous assumption that the world is a good place. 5) More social and family freedom than was allowed in the more rigid caste system that followed.  Some modern Indian Christians have said that the Vedic sacrificial ceremonies bare an uncanny resemblance to the death of Jesus on the cross.  I found partial confirmation of some of these ideas here, though of course O'Flaherty did not select her poems to illustrate them! <br />As for the person who gives the book low marks because it contains no Sanskrit, that seems rather selfish to me.  It is not fair to condemn a writer who wants to reacha general audience and keep the price down, who has lavished so much loving scholarship on her work, on that score.<br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man<br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2001-01-23

Anyone who is interested in how the religious traditions of humanity relate to one another -- one of the major questions of our time -- ought to make it a priority to read this book.  Farquhar gives a sweeping and illuminating introduction to Hinduism.  But that is just the beginning.  Sensational without being sensationalistic, he offers a steady accumulation of evidence and quotes and facts that adds up to an argument for the role Jesus can, ought to, and even ninety years ago (when this book was published) had begun to play as the &quot;crown&quot; of the Hindu tradition.  If you think Indian tradition can stand on its own, or if you think Hinduism is nothing but the work of demons, you should read this book and carefully consider what the author has to say.  &quot;One feels haunted by symbol and suggestion  . . . The missionary who fails to acknowledge the presence of these right ideas . . . does not deserve to get the ear of the educated classes.&quot;  This man does deserve our ear.   <br />In systematic fashion, the author discusses the relatively cheerful Vedic religion.  He describes the traditional Hindu family, and how gender roles became fixed. He explains the moral underpinnings and the effects of the theory of karma on Hindu society.  He discusses the theory behind caste, and how it arose.  In chapter six, he explains the relationship between the self and the universal consciousness, and the rise of different schools of thought from the time of the Upanishads.  In the next chapter, &quot;The Yellow Robe,&quot; the author describes Hindu asceticism and monasticism, and the ideas behind self-torture and renunciation.  Chapter eight explains the role of idols in Hindu worship.  The next chapter describes major sects.  Chapter ten shows how the idea of avatars became popular.  Finally, chapter eleven summarizes the author's argument.  His conclusion, strikes with a great deal of force by this time, as he has laid the foundation for it and given examples, with a great deal of detail and quotations from thoughtful Hindus, throughout the book.  &quot;Christ provides the fulfillment of each of the highest aspirations and aims of Hinduism. . . Every true motive. . . finds in Him fullest exercise in work for the downtrodden, the ignorant, the sick, and the sinful. . . He is the Crown of the faith of India.&quot;  <br />If that statement bothers you, read the book, and see if you can find a better interpretation for the facts he presents.  <br />A couple books to make the picture complete would be Vishal Mangalwadi's The World of the Gurus, and Christ in Ancient Vedas, or the material in my new book on the same subject.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man<br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2001-01-19

The author appears to have been deeply influenced by the thinking of Gandhi.  Like Gandhi, he is often up-front about what he doesn't like in Hinduism, and they are the same things -- &quot;Don't you think (Manu's) statements about women are outright nonsense?&quot; (the son asks, the father does not dispute it); &quot;the caste system is a disgrace to Hinduism.&quot;  He tries to be open-minded and relate his ideas to science.  He puts a lot of emphasis on the Bhagavad Gita.  He tries to assimilate or at least acknowledge the good points in other religions within his understanding of Hinduism.  (He actually proposes that Jesus' death on the cross cleansed his immediate followers of karma.)  At the same time, he also makes some major mistakes about Christianity; nor am I sure I agree with his understanding of the Dao Dejing.  In all these regards, his approach resembles that of Gandhi, whom he also refers to quite often.<br />The book is broken into managable but rather disordered topic-bites, giving a pointalistic portrait of the subject.  It's well-written, though the editing could be improved.  The &quot;Father-Son&quot; format is hard to swallow, since the author seems to assume that his audience knows a lot about other religions and nothing about Hinduism.  (Is this the first time the subject has come up?) But it allows the author to cover the subjects that he thinks will be of interest to most readers.   <br />As a Christian who studies comparative religion I found this book  helpful as a popular and thoughtful modern defense of Hinduism.  I just read an even better book on the same subject, however, called the Crown of Hinduism.  The author, a missionary in India about ninety years ago, granted many of Viswanathan's main premises -- that the communal search for truth is progressive, that there is something worthwhile in all religions, that you catch more flies with honey.  And he explained the various aspects of Hinduism extremely well.  But in the search for a modern integration of Indian traditions, he came to a radically different, and powerfully argued, though controversial, conclusion.  (Hint: the title refers to Jesus.)  If you are open to considering the relationship between Hinduism and other religions from a wise and informed Christian perspective, I recommend that book as well.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man<br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2001-01-19

The whole book works a strange magic on the susceptible reader, but it may take me a few more journeys to figure it out very well.   <br />MacDonald tells his story, or weaves his magic, for a deeper part of the soul than most authors attempt to reach.  There is a good kind of weird going on here: a raven who is a librarian, a moon that protects a traveler, a cat woman whose scratches heal.  The villains in this book are nasty indeed, though Macdonald shows how pain and loss (which he embodies with some ghastly images) can bring about the worst person's redemption.  (His thoughts on that subject bring to mind another image of hell, &quot;the death room&quot; of a communist prison camp where the Jewish pastor Richard Wurmbrand lived for two and a half years. &quot;Fascists, Communists, saints, murderers, thieves, priests,&quot; he said, &quot;none died without making his peace with God and man.&quot;  So there is some empirical base for his hopes; though perhaps less Scriptural.)  <br />This book is not for everyone -- it is not &quot;science fiction,&quot; but fantasy, a genre some people cannot abide.   A couple good companion volumes would be C. S. Lewis' The Great Divorce, and M. Scott Peck's The People of the Lie, both of which contain related insights into the nature of The Great Choice.

And unlike most Hollywood movies, there are some real heroes in this one.  <br />The story is extremely well-told.  The co-author seems to have done a good job of allowing Norma to speak in her own voice, and she doesn't hide her flaws, hurts, or biases, or idiosyncricies.  I think anyone who is interested in the topic of abortion, or just wants to read a fascinating spiritual pilgrimage, should read this book.  Then give it to a friend.<br />Apart from abortion, one of the most unsettling things about the story Ms. McCorvey tells is the injustice and bigotry with which the press, courts, and even the police treated Operation Rescue.  It makes you wonder if, for all our history of free speech, our American love of freedom runs as deep in our veins, and is as secure, as we would like to think.  <br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2001-01-11

This is one of the best autobiographies I have ever read.  It's like seeing history through the eyes of a very thoughtful Forrest Gump, a slightly detached observer, who observes and records what he sees in the people around him; Mao, Nehru, Zhou Enlai.  It is full of humorous details: how the Dalai Lama slid on the polished floor of his palace, the mice that came to eat the offerings in his room, how he had the footmen make toy models of tanks and airplanes out of bread dough.  He has a great sense of humor and of beauty. <br />I found several anamolies in this account, however.  For example, the Dalai Lama expresses shock at the suggestion that a Tibetan might try to assassinate him.  The idea &quot;showed how little understanding the Chinese had of the Tibetan character.&quot; &quot;The idea of killing any living creature is anathema to Buddhists.&quot;   Yet according to his mother (in Dalai Lama, My Son) his own father may have been victim of assasination.  (By a Tibetan.) On the position of women in Tibetan society, too, the Dalai Lama gives a positive spin at odds with the accessment of his Mother.  Again, he claims that Tibetan society has &quot;always been highly tolerant&quot; and that &quot;a number of Christian missions were admitted without hindrance.&quot;  In fact, a number of Christians were killed by Tibetan Buddhists, and their churches burnt to the ground.  Repeatedly, the Dalai Lama encourages the myth of Tibetan pacifism.  But in a prior incarnation, (if the theory be believed) he originally gained power by inviting foreign invasion and precipitating civil war.  <br />The depiction of Chinese-Tibetan relations before the modern era is also one-sided and unreliable.  In fact, the Chinese suffered a great deal under the thumb of Tibetan lamas during the Yuan Dynasty; surely he ought to be aware of that history.  <br />For the informed reader, such errors need not detract much from the story.  One does not expect a patriot to be objective about thetragic and cruel destruction of his homeland.  Maybe the Dalai Lama is just naive.  He was fooled by Mao, and still seems oddly upbeat about &quot;pure&quot; Marxism.  I would say such errors remind us that he is only human.  But he is a remarkable human, with a touching and well-told story that deserves to be read.     <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2001-01-04

As usual, Yancey provides his readers with searching questions, wise insights, great quotes (maybe too many), doubts that help the believer get in touch with the skeptic and the skeptic with the believer inside each of us, and scrupulous honesty.  A literary non-Christian, or anyone flaling about looking for God, might find a great deal of help here: there's some rich stuff in this book, and I appreciate Yancey's willingness to verbalize his doubts.  <br />I think Yancey's writing as a whole may have been strongest when he was teamed with Paul Brand, however.  Perhaps his restless, questioning thoughts needs to be steadied in profession, place, or outward-oriented study.  The quotations and examples in this book seem at times like sand joined with too little mortar.  A little more passion, and a little less introspection, might lend his writing more continuity.  As it is, the parts seem greater than the whole.    <br />At one point Yancey reports how God seemed to speak to him (&quot;to my great surprise&quot;) and tell him to &quot;Question your doubts as much as your faith&quot; &quot;Allow the good to penetrate as deeply as the bad&quot; and &quot;find something that allows you to feel God's pleasure,&quot; among other things.  This book seems to represent a continuing struggle towards a realization of these truths on Yancey's part. <br />If you don't understand the title of this review, read C. S. Lewis' Silver Chair.

As a Christian trying to understand Buddhism better, I found this  a clear and concise introduction to the central philosophy of Buddhism, with a strong humanistic emphasis.  (Very different from the grass-roots Buddhist spirituality I have seen in Asia.)  The Dalai Lama shows that he is not only a statesman and a leader, but also a teacher, scholar, and (most of all) a kind person.  Often he amazes me with his honesty, even doubts.  <br />This little book covers a lot of ground, and uses a lot of abstract nouns and very few anecdotes in the process, so it takes concentration to read.  I found his discussion of the third  noble truth, emptiness, frustrating.  I kept waiting for him to define exactly what he meant by &quot;empty&quot; &quot;intrinsic existence&quot; and &quot;unreal&quot; in the Madhyamaka school he follows, but I felt he never really explained how his idea of emptiness differed from the common sense observation that everything in life changes.  I wrote in the margin on page 107, &quot;'Nothing lasts.'  Have we got any further than this yet?&quot; because I found his explanation vague and extremely broad, so broad the Dalai Lama almost seemed at times to be defining me as a Buddhist.  But otherwise most of his explanations, and his discussions of the various schools, were clear and helpful.  <br />The book ends with a rather simple but touching essay on kindness.  For those who would like another perspective on self-love and compassion, try John Piper's Enjoying God: the Confessions of a Christian Hedonist, or C. S. Lewis' Four Loves.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-12-28

Russell is certainly a lively writer.  The essay that most impressed me was A Free Man's Worship.  As a Christian, I found this essay an eloquent and poetic specimen of the trajedy Russell admired.  (Though I disagree with it.)  <br />The title essay, and some of the others, however, come across to one who does not share Russell's emotional reasons for disliking Christianity, or is aware of contrary evidence, as cranky at best.  Here are a few samples: &quot;There's no reason the world could not have come into being without a cause.&quot;  &quot;The Christian church is the principle enemy of moral progress in the world.&quot;  &quot;No orthodox Christian can find any positive reason&quot; for condemning the murder of unbaptised children.  &quot;That Christianity improved the status of women. . . is one of the grossest perversions it is possible to make.&quot;  &quot;The whole concept of God is derived from the ancient Oriental despotisms.&quot;  &quot;Historically it is doubtful whether Christ existed.&quot;  <br />It is easy to understand gut-level responses to such rhetoric, as reflected in the reviews on both sides below.  Russell makes bold statements in a tone of brisk confidence that he seems to expect his readers will interpret as the certainty a truly logical approach to life can ensure.  To me, as to others, such statements often come across as flaky, dogmatic, and out of touch with reality.  <br />I have a special reason for feeling that way.  I just finished writing a book (Jesus and the Religions of Man) that argues flatly to the contrary on most of these points.  (Not that I was aiming at Russell in particular.)  I did a lot of research on these topics for my book, and give a good chunk of empirical data.  With that evidence still fresh in mind, Russell's breezy statements (accompanied by almost no evidence) come across as bombastic and a little unreal.     <br />And so I salute Russell as the poet lauriette of modern agnosticism.  But don't buy into his arguments, or rather credal statements, until you've had a chance to really look over the evidence, for both sides.  <br />Why was Russell not a Christian?  In Faith of the Fatherless, psychologist Paul Vitz proposed a different (and tragic) theory, having to do with Russell's sad and lonely childhood.  I don't want to be patronizing.  But I do find some support for Vitz' theory both in Russell's mode of argument, and in the way he sometimes wrote of life. &quot;When I contemplate the things that people do with their lives, I think (the end of the world) is almost a consolation.&quot;  &quot;(It is plausible that) this world was made by the devil when God was not looking.&quot;  It is hard for me to believe that anyone who has known deep human love, or even carefully studied the weeds in his own backyard,could say such things.  <br />And so read this book with both a critical mind and an open heart.  The barbs of Bertrand Russell should be a reminder to believers to be patient with skeptics, even or especially when they mock our faith.  And for those who are tempted to take Russell's pronouncements at face value, let me recommend a few books (besides my own, of course)to balance these ideas as written here and as echoed by modern followers:  Hugh Ross, Creator and the Cosmos; Charles Thaxton, Heart of Science; G. K. Chesterton, Everlasting Man; and Don Richardson, Eternity in Their Hearts, and maybe Gary Habermas, on the historical Jesus.     <br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-12-26

City of God is a difficult, complex, and wide-ranging book, which makes many references to persons and places that will often be obscure to most of us.  But I think anyone can learn something from the genius and wide-ranging observations of Augustine.  One of the first things I noticed when I began reading this book about twenty years ago was, &quot;Hey! I recognize that faith!&quot;  Him, a Latin-speaking north African &quot;Catholic&quot; of the 4th Century, me, a 20th Century English-speaking Norte Americano WASP.  City of God showed me that the Church of Christ is more united in its diversity than I realized.  And in a sense, Augustine is broader still; he writes not only as a Christian, but as a human being.  All of us can learn something from him, I think:<br />The skeptic.  You will find a few ideas here based on an out-dated &quot;pre-scientific worldview.&quot;  If you're looking for something to laugh at, and aren't intimidated by his intellect, you may be able to pull out a few quotes.  But if you're looking for truth, you'll find much more, in every way. Augustine's love of truth burns from the pages of this book like a flame.  The scope of his curiosity is broad, and his intellect first-rate by any standard.  <br />The missionary.  In the tradition of Paul and John, point people to a God not entirely unknown.  Remind people how their own ancestors sought God, and knew something about Him before we got there.  Quote the oracle of Apollo, or the Platonists, to prove Christ.  Expect God to do miracles. <br />The New Ager.  The period in which Augustine wrote City of God bares a striking resemblance to our own.  &quot;Many civilizations had met in one civilization,&quot; as Chesterton put it.  Augustine argues against reincarnation and channeling and other modern fads.  His solution is neither complete negation nor complete affirmation, but a more subtle synthesis that allows truths of many cultures to meet in Christ and find fulfillment; a solution that modern Christians have applied in an interesting way to redemptive truths in Buddhism, Hinduism, Marxism, and Islam.  <br />The debater and apologist.  This book is a model for those who who want to make an effective argument.  Know your opponent's arguments as well as they know them themselves.  Admit when they are on the right track.  When they wander off it, quote sources they see as authoritative to show the error of their nehs.  Love truth.  Use reason and passion in equal measure.  (But maybe, in our day, don't be quite so long-winded. . . I mean thorough.)<br />While I respect those reviewers below who read City of God cover to cover, personally I skimmed a bit.  The Penguin edition also has a useful, though concise, index.<br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-12-18

What Frazier seems to love is the ways and rhythmns of nature.  In terms of plot, the book can be faulted.  As one reader below notes, there is little sense of the movement of time or building drama -- the hero gets there when he gets there, and as to his thinking and plans and fears before then, the author is almost as terse as the characters themselves.  But Frasier gives a rich and convincing portrayal of nature, showing keen observation, added to a deeply moral, though rather anti-clerical (but you can come by that honestly) feel for life.  <br />A few quotes may help you decide if this is the book for you.  &quot;The smell of river hung in the air, about equal parts mineral and vegetable.&quot;  It is a sensual book, in the sense that it engages vision and sound and smell extremely well.  &quot;Ada had tried to love all the year equally . . . Nevertheless, she could not get over loving autumn the best.&quot;  There is an autumnal meloncholy and fruitfulness to this story, a feeling of death, but also thankfulness for life. &quot;He was a solitary pilgrim, strange in his ways and governed by no policy or creed common to flocking birds.&quot;  That is of a heron, or the hero, or the author, depending on how you interpret it.  &quot;She told Inman. . . about weather and plants and . . . All the ways life takes shape.  You could build your own life on the observation of it.&quot;  Just so has Fraser built his tale.  <br />If you like that kind of thing, read the book for its merits, even if it takes a while.  If you feel comfortable with the pace of this book, but want to try something with a little more magic and a little less grey, I found George Macdonald's Lilith a good piece of mythological deprograming.  <br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2000-12-04

I blew a Saturday reading this book; I could hardly put it down.  I wouldn't call it a utopia, like some readers; even the &quot;Golden Age,&quot; when the Overlords rule a prosperous earth, seems from the first the beginning of a horrible and fascinating nightmare.  And, I couldn't help thinking, one that might come true.  Not that our Overlords will come from space; I suspect we may build them ourselves.  Our computers won't need psychic abilities; they  may float their thoughts across the Internet and become One.  What they will do after that -- Clarke's may be as good a guess as any.<br />Clarke's other peeks at the future often seem shrewd and even inspired, but sometimes bizarre.  The cosmic leap in evolution produces a collective entity with as little in the way of scruples or love of beauty as Big Brother; yet he seems to think it a step forward.  His overlords begin their regency by ending cruelty to animals, and end it . . .  All in all, a weird, psychodelic ride.  When you get off, you might decompress by visiting the lovely utopia of C. S.

Written by Marx and Engels as a tract to stimulate the workers of Europe (in particular) to revolution, Communist Manifesto is more readable than many of Marx' other works, its style simpler and more lively.  At times the rhetoric rises to the level of eloquent.  As one of the most influential works in human history, it seems to me any person who wishes to understand the modern world will want to be somewhat familiar with its contents. <br />It is true Marx did not predict revolution in &quot;backwards&quot; countries like Russia and China, but rather in countries like America and Germany.  The fact that he made such prophecies at all shows how little his doctrines had to do with science; that they failed (at the time) shows his weaknesses as a religious oracle.  But that is the category to which this work belongs: Marx is a religious revolutionary in the tradition of Mohammed and Hong Xiuquan, the Monkey King's assault on Heaven, or Promethius' war on the gods.  (On the latter of which he wrote his doctoral dissertation.) That 150 years later society has come to resemble a few of his prophecies (though others not at all) hardly qualifies him as a respectable co-founder of social science, unless we admit that all social science is quackery and mumbo-jumbo.  (Which may be arguable.)<br />What Marxist revolutionaries captured of Marx was not so much his economic plan (which had already proven in error) but his spirit, shown more explicitly here than in his more &quot;scholarly works.&quot;  The great Marxist revolutionaries did not copy Marx to the letter in terms of economic programs -- how could they?  Nor in revolutionary strategy -- what did he know of the future?  But even when they ignored the political program Marx lays out, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Guzman, and others, were near carbon copies of their Master as revealed in terms of psychology -- ruthless, unwilling to allow disagreement, ready to &quot;abolish all morality, all eternal truths, all religion,&quot; aspectre of collective self-justifying cruelty that would haunt not just Europe, but the world.  I often wonder, reading works by Marx, how stolid academic Marxists can overlook the most obvious and truly influential element in Marx' writings: his hatred.  It is that hatred that makes this one of the less wearying of Marx's works to read, because it is fairly short.  <br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man (including Marxism)<br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-11-24

If, when you think of &quot;eastern philosophy,&quot; yourheart goes pitter-patter for esoteric revelations from AscendedMasters, stories of Jesus practicing magic in Tibet as a youngster, oreven the mind-expanding wit of Zhuang Zi, you may find Confuciusboringly prosaic.  His wisdom lies in a different direction, and ismore subtle.  The Analects is like a bowl of Chinese dumplings, or attheir most flavorful dim sum, that you pick out one at a time andlearn the taste and value of.  Few of his sayings are brilliant, butrather the kind of mundane and kindly profundity that the war-wearyChina of the late Zhou found so filling.  In modern China, too, I havefound that Confucius is very popular, probably more popular than thewitty Lao Zi.  <br />Confucius said his teachings were connected by asingle thread.  While a disciple gave a slightly different solution,the thread I suggest you follow through this otherwise ratherdisjointed collection of teachings and observations is humility.  Bythat I don't mean self-abnegation or loss of individuality in thecollective, but an ability to see clearly in all directions -- above,towards superiors (ultimately God), below, compassion for the needy,within, (&quot;To know what you know, and know what you don't know,this is knowledge&quot;) and without, to take an interest in the worldaround you.  (Confucius became China's &quot;first teacher&quot;because he himself was &quot;eager to learn.&quot;) To me, this kindof integrated humility is the starting point for any worthwhilephilosophy of life.  <br />The Analects can also be of value to peopleinterested in the critical study of the New Testament, by the way.This book greatly resembles the Gospels in terms of genre.  Bothconsist of sayings and actions of a teacher who traveled with a bandof disciples, as recorded by the early community of followers.  Fewscholars doubt the historical character of the Analects, whilecontroversy about the Gospels makes headlines on a regular basis.  Itis interesting to me that the same internal arguments scholars likeCreel and Lau use to prove the Analects, apply even more strongly tothe Gospels.  If you do read the two sets of documents together, youmight try the further experiment of comparing Confucius' ideal person,sage or &quot;Savior&quot; as Confucian scholar Chen Jingpan describeshim, to the central character of the Gospels.  Remember that Menciussaid a sage would appear once every 500 years, and Confucius lived in500 B.C. As a Christian I respect Confucius not only as a great moralteacher, but also sometimes think he might have been a kind ofprophet.  <br />Five stars for Confucius; one lost in translation.Soothill seems accurate, as far as I can tell, and the price is right,but his language is a bit archaic at times.

If you're looking for an in-depth portrait of the Dalai Lama as a child, you will probably be disappointed here.  This is not the story of &quot;Dalai Lama, My Son,&quot; but of the mother.  The first almost half of the book tells of her youth and married life in Ambo, or Qinghai Province.  A few pages in the middle do describe the Dalai Lama's early character leading to his selection.  From there on, his mother refers to him as &quot;His Holiness&quot; and says little about him, but tells her personal and family story after fate plunged them into politics.  <br />I did enjoy the book, though, especially the first part.  I've lived and traveled in the Himilayan foothills of southern China.  Reading the author's description of her familie's life style -- celebrations, marriage, story telling, being snowed in during winter -- made me want to go back and see more.    <br />A famous missionary doctor, Dr. Paul Brand, once said his ideal lifestyle, apart from a need for modern medicine, would be that of an Indian villager.  This account of the Tibetan lifestyle, and my own travels through the minority areas of Yunnan Province, confirm how much that is human and natural we lose in our surrender to technology: rhythms of the seasons, traditions, the hard pleasure of sowing and reaping, and what it means to depend on family and community.  <br />The later part of the book is interesting sometimes, but is a bit like the story of a pawn who wanders onto a chessboard by mistake and gets moved around by both sides without quite knowing what is going on.  <br />Despite the quarrel below, there is little about what Westerners call Buddhism in this book.  What most Asians call Buddhism is a mixture of polytheism, various superstitions, practical concern about evil spirits, and a cycle of annual festivals, with priests occupying a respected but mostly ceremonial position.  One of the most surprising things about this very open and simple account is that the Dalai Lama's mother is allowed to speak as a typical Asian in this respect.  <br />In fact, there may be more about ghosts here than about the author's most famous son.  Tsering blamed them for the loss of four of her children (out of sixteen), and did not seem embarrassed by the odd character of the stories she told.  Her stories set me thinking.  One of the foundational myths of Tibetan Buddhism is the tale of how the monk Phadmasambhava conquered the demons of Tibet, and having conquered them, put them to work for the forces of good.  Tsering's experiences with ghosts might cause some to reconsider the relative merits of the &quot;tolerant&quot; Buddhist approach and the more confrontational Christian approach to powers and principalities.  One also wonders, of course, what relationship these spirits bare to the diseases that marred the lifestyle of such peasants.<br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man<br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-11-19

As a young man trying to decide whether or not to believe the things I grew up in, this book was very helpful to me.  I remember reading the chapter on pride, &quot;The Great Sin,&quot; one night at a camp in Alaska where I was counseling.  The Holy Spirit showed me myself in that chapter.  I poured over this book in those days, internalized it, even learned Chinese hoping to translate it.  <br />I have since &quot;moved on&quot; to more detailed and empirically-oriented books by Christians, skeptics, and followers of other religions.  Many of these offer interesting facts and insights. But the only place I have found as much wisdom as here (outside the Bible) was G. K. Chestertons's Everlasting Man, which influenced Lewis to faith.  (As for Conversations With God, the innane &quot;revelation&quot; one reader recommends instead, a single paragraph of Lewis or Chesterton contains more wisdom than the whole first volume.)<br />Lewis has a marvelous gift for explaining things in simple terms without patronizing or talking down.  Some may find his argument difficult, and others, too simple.  In that case I recommend further reading; Lewis is not trying to be thorough.<br />I agree with the skeptic below that Lewis does not offer &quot;proof&quot; of God, or even logically-compelling evidence.  He dismisses atheism with amazing abruptness.  &quot;Atheism is too simple. . . If the universe has no meaning, we would never have found out.&quot;  (How does he know that?  Does he have a control universe in his pocket?)  But don't misunderstand.  Lewis does not really offer &quot;proof&quot; of God.  Notice he calls section one, &quot;Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe.&quot;  Lewis views our relationship with God not in scientific but in personal terms.  God does not force faith on His wayward children, but drops hints for those who are seeking, is his assumption.  Life is not an equation, but an adventure, even a romance with truth.  <br />Some also suggest a loophole in Lewis' famous &quot;Liar, Lunatic, or Lord&quot; argument for the deity of Christ.  Jesus' words were misrepresented by his followers, they say: he didn't really make the claims the Gospels say he did.  Here again, remember that Lewis is trying to be concise.  If you want his answer to that objection (still a very devastating answer, if you are familiar with Jesus Seminar material), you'll find it in his essay, Fernseed and Elephants.  The argument is also more fully developed in the first chapters of &quot;On the Man Called Christ,&quot; in part two of Everlasting Man, where I guess Lewis found it in the first place.<br />There are books with a more empirical approach to the existence of God; Hugh Ross' book on the Anthropic Principle, Creator and the Cosmos, for example, or Don Richardson's Eternity in Their Hearts, that shows how God has worked in cultures around the world.  My new book, Jesus and the Religions of Man, argues for the existence of God from comparative religion and miracles.  It also discusses the divinity of Jesus in relation to other religions.  But I don't know any modern popular author of any viewpoint who can hold a candle to Lewis or Chesterton in terms of expressing deep truths in simple words.  Reading Mere Christianity and finding only &quot;a mess of holes,&quot; would be like going into a mine full of precious jewels and coming out with bucket of coal.  There are truths here that will enrich you the rest of your life, if you lay hold of them.     <br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-11-14

This is a pretty good, fairly balanced discussion of the role of Christianity in science.  The authors discuss the influence of philosophical ideas on science, and vice-versa, from the ancient Greeks to modern DNA research.  Their approach is primarily historical, in that they discuss scientific theories in the context of the people who developed them, rather than striking out on their own into research, or even discussing much that remains scientifically controversial until the final chapter.  The history they are giving will be new to many, especially skeptics who have been trained to think that science escaped from Christianity like Odesseus from the cave of the Cyclops.  This book should be in every church library or pastor's study precisely because that argument is so popular among modern skeptics.  <br />Some of the ideas Thaxton and Pearcey introduce in this book were new to me -- the idea that there is some problem about mathematics &quot;working,&quot; for example -- and I am still mulling them over.  I suspect they may at times be obscuring the difference between &quot;What is true?&quot; and &quot;What can be proven to be true from first principles?&quot; just a little bit.  <br />I also had some problems with the last chapter.  Their discussion of information theory and the formation of the first cell was too long-winded and short on details.  They also relegated what appeared a strong counter-argument -- that primitive RNA may have been able to make use of evolution even before the cell was formed -- to part of a footnote, and then failed to answer it.  Perhaps that's what you get when historians pronounce on topics that scientists are still picking over.  Still, in that chapter they do give a healthy challenge to materialistic science: &quot;Several decades of origin-of-life experiments have already revealed consistent trends. . . Today we can say quite definitely what atoms and molecules will do when left to themselves. . . and what they will not do is spontaneously organize themselves into the complex structures of life. . . The contemporary design argument does not rest on gaps in our knowledge but rather on the growth in our knowledge . . .&quot;  This may not be the final word, but it whets my appetite to continue following the discussion.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-11-13

Reading this book from cover to cover would be educational journey, but probably most readers will skip from place to place, as I did.  Honestly, I found the 17th Century sermons, which make up a large part of the book, quite hard to follow, though I don't doubt there is much in them that will make the effort worthwhile, if I have need to look more closely.  <br />There is doubtless something to delight and offend everyone in this volume.  The editors have been fairly conscientious in taking selections from a variety of viewpoints.  Liberals may get a bit more space in the 20th Century selection, but on the other hand, J. Gresham Machen's ringing defense of the historicity of the Gospels, History and Faith, is also included.  (A work that could have been written as a reply to the Jesus Seminar of eight decades later.  A very devastating reply.) I also found Henry Ward Beecher's pre-Civil War jeremiad against slavery stirring and of more than historical interest.  (That, too, of course.  He was the brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, of Uncle Tom's Cabin fame.)  Joseph Smith's rambling funeral oration was useful in a different way, giving positive evidence for my prior feeling that the man was a bit, shall we say, close to the edge.<br />Agree or disagree, readers of every viewpoint will find something  of interest in this volume.  It would be a most valuable reference tool for any class on American history, and, I think, belongs in every school library.<br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-11-13

This book is composed of forty-three bite-sized essays by various persons who have had some relation to Harvard U.  (Taken classes, guest-lectured, fed a squirrel on campus.)  Not all are brilliant or profound, but many are, and most of the others are worth reading.  My favorites were the Solzhenitsyn and Robert Coles essays, that I had read elsewhere, Nicholas Woltershorff's classy biographical essay, Krisher Sairsingh's story of conversion to Christianity from Hinduism (he is the cousin of Rabi Maharaj, author of Death of Guru), Poh Lian Lim's essay on sexual dignity, Robert Massie's funny experience as a monk in business school, Charles Thaxton on the Christian roots of science, (his book on the subject, The Soul of Science, is great!) and John Rankin on &quot;Power and Gender at the Divinity School,&quot; which is also autobiographical and funny.  (Sorry.  I meant to end that sentence sooner, but kept remembering other good essays.)  The story by the student who later died of cancer is also moving.  As you can see, the book is diverse, even a bit scattered; but you don't have to read them all at once, or even read them all at all.  Read one per cup of hot chocolate and donut, and call your pastor in the morning.  <br />  Having myself passed through years of Humanist, Marxist and skeptical indoctrination in school, I see no need to rely on independant thought to come to materialistic conclusions; skepticism has poured in on me all my life from the ether, like background radiation.  The reason I am a Christian is that I found this &quot;ancient means of describing how the world works&quot; does in fact describe it better than modern skeptics and other anti-Christian writers.  (Of whom I have read a fair number.)  Many of the authors of these essays, at one point in their careers, shared the same blind prejudices against Christianity as this skeptic.  It was often learning to think for themselves that pulled them out of it.  The California lawyer is undoubtedly right when he implies that not everyone who goes to Harvard is open to truth.  (Whether or not that makes them &quot;morons&quot; is another question.)  But here you can read the story of some who I think were.	2000-11-12

For a volume that contains less than 200 pages, this book is certainly rich with interesting ideas.  Furthermore, the author has mulled them over until they came to intellectual ripeness.  Within an outline drawn from the Apostles' Creed, Polkinghome gives his view of the anthropic principle, the relation of body to mind, the nature of God, the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and other subjects, in a thoughtful manner.  He strikes a good balance between authority and personal opinion.  He refers frequently and in humility to what well-known thinkers on all sides of the questions at hand have said (he has obviously done his homework), but is confident, bold, and smart enough to pick his own path across the fields of fact.  He argues, at one point, that &quot;The titles assigned to Jesus play the role that models do in scientific investigation.&quot;  In other words, the New Testament does not appear as a mass of dogmas artificially superimposed upon stories of Jesus' life.  Rather, terms like &quot;Son of God&quot; show the early Christians groping for a way of coming to grips with remarkable facts.  That is the kind of &quot;bottoms up&quot; approach Polkinghome appreciates.  <br />I have three caveats.  First, Polkinghome slips into theological jargon too often.  Second, his idea that we do not have souls, but that at some point in the future, God will make copies of us from His perfect knowledge, not from the same bits of matter though, seemed weak to me.  I mean, presumably God could do the same now -- there could be copies of us running around on other planets.  But what does that have to do with you or I or the promises of Scripture?  <br />Third, what Polkinghome primarily seems to give here is a cautious explanation of his faith, rather than a strong argument for it.  His initial caution lends his ultimate conclusions about the resurrection of Jesus, for example, a great deal of weight.  But while agnostics and atheists who make this book their tokenforay into Christian apologetics could do worse, they should be aware that the author is passing over some very strong areas of evidence for Christianity.  Please do not put the book down saying, &quot;Well, I survived that; I guess I'm safe.&quot;  I suggest you also consider the psychological truths G. K. Chesterton discusses in Everlasting Man, the history Don Richardson relates in Eternity in Their Hearts, and the many testimonies of modern Christians on how God answers prayer.  (Miracles are the most &quot;bottoms-up&quot; kind of evidence for God.) You might also find my new book, Jesus and the Religions of Man, worth a read, especially if the question Polkinghome raised about spiritual alternatives to the Christian faith is of interest.<br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-11-10
US	50798783	R2X1EJBCR02ABR	0375409491	271579697	How to Know God: The Soul's Journey Into the Mystery of Mysteries (Deepak Chopra)	Books	2	56	91	N	N	How to escape God.	Chopra is a skillful writer who has read (well, skimmed) widely.  But he should have called this book, &quot;How to get away from God.&quot;  Here are some of the dodges he uses:<br />1. &quot;One bald fact stands at the beginning of any search for God.  He leaves no footprints in the material world.&quot;  This statement sets the tone for the immense subjective dogmatism of the book.  But that which you decide at the beginning of your search should not be called a &quot;fact,&quot; but a &quot;prejudice.&quot;  Before you agree on this point too quickly, read Creator and the Cosmos, by astronomer Hugh Ross.  <br />2. Chopra treats both Christianity and science as a bird searching for twigs for his own nest treats the nests of other birds.  He retells the story of Adam and Eve casting serpent as hero and God as villain; in the process overlooking all the profound subtleties and psychological insights of the passage.  He shamelessly misrepresents Christianity: &quot;None of the kings of Israel is punished for going to war.&quot;  (False.) &quot;Jesus is adamantly opposed to war.&quot;  (He never said so.) &quot;Christianity was too new to be lawful.&quot;  (No, it was too exclusive; there were lots of new religions, then as now.)  &quot;In the Bible one finds such verses as, &quot;Seek ye the kingdom of heaven within.&quot;  (Uh, no, one doesn't.)<br />3. Chopra freely picks and chooses from science as well.  He waves the words &quot;science&quot; and &quot;quantum physics&quot; before the readers like magic wands.  But like Rajneesh, who called intellect &quot;the chief villain,&quot; and Muktananda, who promised to liberate his followers from &quot;impossible webs of intellect,&quot; Chopra believes we create our own reality, and it shows in his science as well.  <br />The art in sophistry is to get your victims to believe because it is absurd: to seduce the clever into thinking themselves wise (and thus becoming fools) through confusing paradox with ordinary nonsense.  This is an art, because if you say things too directly (&quot;Jesus was a Hindu.  The Jews chose extermination.&quot;) the paradox deflates into parody, and the spell snaps.  Chopra, more than Walsch, is a master of inflated, high-sounding, ego-massaging argument, but many of his ideas reduce to such things.  If you want true paradox, as well as refreshment after all this sophistry, try G. K. Chesterton, Lao Zi, the Prayer of St. Francis, or the Beatitudes.    <br />4. Chopra grossly confuses the categories of miracle and magic.  (See my book, Jesus and the Religions of Man, for an empirical discussion of the differences.)  <br />5. Chopra is a naive about modern guruism, meditation, and the various gurus.  For more critical views, see Spiritual Tourist by Mick Brown, Avatar of Night by Tal Brooke, or Truth and Social Reform and (best of all) The World of Gurus, by Indian thinker Vishal Mangalwadi.<br />6. Chopra also passes over real common ground between Hinduism and Christianity.  One strong element in the ancient Rig Veda is the theme of sacrifice, of God who is also man who will sacrifice Himself.  (With a great deal of very interesting prophetic detail.  Again, see Jesus and the Religions of Man.)  If Chopra wanted to join the two religions, he missed a good chance here.  But of course he wants Christianity to evolve into his idea of Hinduism, not the other way around.  <br />Unlike Chopra, I do not claim to be an expert on God.  But of two things I am certain: that in His essential nature, the true God is good.  And that the path to God at every stage, for saint as much as sinner, begins in humility.  As Jesus said, &quot;No one can enter the Kingdom of Heaven unless he becomes as a little child.&quot;  Let me suggest a few books by people who came to God as children, and really met him. By Searching, by Isobel Kuhn; Confessions, by Augustine; and Goforth of China, by Rosalin Goforth.  I also recommend John Piper's Enjoying God: The Confessions of a Christian Hedonist.	2000-11-09
US	50798783	R2J2G9XBTZDB4S	0761509410	910224725	God: The Evidence: The Reconciliation of Faith and Reason in a Postsecular World	Books	4	8	11	N	N	Well -- some of it.	This book is a readable and fairly thoughtful overview of a few arguments for the existence of God based on modern scientific or medical discoveries.  I found the argument he gave for Near Death Experiences stronger than some below want to admit, but also rather baffling; I haven't heard an explanation from any quarter that really covers all the facts.  The correlation he describes between health and faith is a valid but indirect argument for the existence of God.  (The Bible does promise blessings to those who trust God, and warns that there are consequences to sin.)       <br />Glynn, I think, understands both science and religion better than Mr. Wong below.  The argument for God from the Anthropic Principle is not rendered invalid because it can't be falsifiable.  For one, as Glynn shows, non-theistic theories of the origin of the universe (bubble universes) are not falsifiable either; but that doesn't stop scientists from proposing them.  Secondly, the question is not, &quot;What is science?&quot;  It is, &quot;What is true?&quot;  And third, the Anthropic Principle is falsifiable.  If we found ourselves in a universe in which the fundamental constraints were not so temperamental, (more like what we once expected) the argument would not hold.  Also, Wong is is a little naive to think &quot;science is process&quot; in which &quot;nothing is so certain it cannot be challenged.&quot;  Is that why all biologists heartily encourage efforts to voice objections to evolution in the schools?  Would Wong agree, then, that scientists should be the first to consider the possibility that even the certainty of death was once challenged?<br />Glynn at times encourages this kind of blind worship of science -- the idea that nothing can be proven other than by test-tubes and microscopes.  I sometimes suspect apologists like Glynn and Polkinghome have worked out a secret agreement with skeptics: &quot;Let's all ignore the millions of people around the world who have seen God answer prayer in extraordinary ways.&quot;  You can't put human testimony, whether historical or judicial, in a test tube; so it doesn't count.  And yet I think such experiences (such as I have had myself) are among the strongest and most immediate evidences for God's existence.      <br />I agree with some below that Glynn's understanding of the relationship between faith and reason is a little simplistic.  He thinks 25 years ago a reasonable person would be an atheist, but now would be a theist.  Maybe Glynn wasn't looking for God 25 years ago.  There was evidence for those who were, and there are outs for people now who aren't.  But it is anti-human and illogical, as some readers suggest, to build a &quot;demilitarized zone between faith and science&quot; so that the words &quot;God&quot; and &quot;evidence&quot; cannot be linked.  As I argue in my new book, Jesus and the Religions of Man, doubt and falsification are the common language of the Gospels and of science.  (In fact, some people say science learned this language from the Gospels.)  Glynn is right to speak in terms of evidence, however Tillich and other so-called &quot;mainline&quot; theologians may disdain it.  (In the sordid tradition of the Bagwan Rajneesh, who said, &quot;Religion has nothing to do with thoughts or thinking.&quot;)  Doubt and openness to falsification are as essential to Christian faith, or to honest search for truth in any field, as in science.  Faith without reason is just pig-headed idolatry.   <br />If you want to read more about the Anthropic Principle and God, works by Hugh Ross or John Polkinghome give more detail, the first from an aggressive, the second from a cautious, stance.  If you're open to historical evidence for the existence of God, try Don Richardson's wonderful Eternity in Their Hearts. <br />I just wrote a 320 page book describing empirical evidence for the Christian faith without overlapping Glynn on almost any point.  (Perhaps I should have called it &quot;God: TheOther Evidence.&quot;)  For those interested in the relationship between faith and reason, Biblical criticism, miracles and magic, the idea of God in pagan cultures, or the influence of Jesus on world history, I guarantee you'll find food for thought.

(Like me)	Orthodoxy is written for the poet and the child in each of us (The latter being that part of us Jesus said can inherit the Kingdom).  Orthodoxy is, at the same time, one of the wisest, and funniest, books I have ever read; almost up to the level of Everlasting Man.  It seems to me he does give a logically challenging, if rather whimsical, argument for the Christian faith here.  And having read many of the most famous skeptics of our time, his argument remains no less timely, powerful, and suggestive.   <br />How do I explain the reaction of the reader below, then, who appears intelligent, but finds &quot;Little that is intellectually bearable&quot; in this book, and could not even read it through once without throwing it down in disgust?  For one thing, Chesterton's approach is not scientific, but psychological.  For those to whom science is the only god, a little prior reading might be worthwhile -- John Polkinghome or Hugh Ross on evidences for the Creator in modern cosmology, for example.  Let Scott Peck's People of The Lie search your heart.  Or even try my book, Jesus and the Religions of Man, which offers empirical evidence of a more historical nature for the truth of the Christian claims. Let the facts presented in these books take the edge of your arrogance.  <br />Then, maybe, go for a walk through Mt. Rainier National Park when the huckleberries are reddening in the fall, or skin dive in Hawaii.  Or walk through a dark forest on a clear night when the stars are out.  Observe and wonder.  Become a child again.  Laugh at your certainties and prejudices a little.  Then try reading this book again.  <br />&quot;(Skepticism) discredits supernatural stories that have some foundation, simply by telling natural stories that have no foundation.&quot;  &quot;The only fun of being a Christian was that a man was not left alone with the Inner Light, but definitely recognized an outer Light, fair as the sun. . .&quot;&quot;To be allowed to make love to the moon and thento complain that Jupiter kept his own moons in a harem seemed to me a vulgar anti-climax.&quot;  You still don't see the relevence or wisdom of such teachings?  Oh, well.  Chesterton did warn, &quot;If a man would make his world large, he must be always making himself small. . . It is impossible without humility to enjoy anything -- even pride.&quot;  This book, I guess, is no exception.	2000-10-24

In this little book, Swedish scholar Per Beskow takes on some of the most influential stories about Jesus of our time: the Book of Mormon, Life of Saint Issa, Aquarian Gospel, Gospel of Barnabas, Gospel of the Holy Twelve, and others.  He describes how each was produced, and shows why each is clearly a fraud.  He knows more about European tales than American, and skips over stories that fall outside the boundaries of his chosen subject matter.  (His approach is mostly historical, so in general he does not deal with channeled revelations.)  Also, the book was written about 20 years ago, so of course he gives no mention of more recent strange story-tellers like Elizabeth Claire Prophet, Richard Paton, or Neale Walsch.  (Though he hardly needs to.)  But within those parameters, his analysis is effective and persuasive.  Beskow is fair-minded and dispassionate, and tends to give his subjects the benefit of the doubt when he can.  At the same time, he cuts through smoke screens and malarky with precision and efficiency.  <br />While his approach is mostly historical, at the end of the book Beskow also remarks on the astonishing &quot;freshness, power, and ability to move&quot; of the N.T. Gospels, in comparison to these works.  For interesting arguments related to that point, I reommend the second half of Chesterton's Everlasting Man, and essays by Machen (History and Faith) and C. S. Lewis (Fernseed and Elephants).  <br />Also my own new book, Jesus and the Religions of Man.  In it, I add the scholarly &quot;historical Jesus&quot; and a few other Hindu and Buddhist figures, to Beskow's list of strange tales.  Just as Muslims, Hindus, Mormons, and New Agers recreate Jesus in their images to protect their view of life, so Humanists like Funk and Crossan betray scholarly principles by &quot;projecting&quot; their ideals onto First Century history.  I argue that this inability of people of various ideologies to write Gospels that match the original, suggests that the disciples not only would not but could not have made up &quot;their&quot; Jesus.<br />I bought several copies of Strange Tales from the publisher several years ago, so even though the book is out of print, it may still be available. <br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-10-20

A novelized philosophical symposium?  An illustrated Bible story?  Whatever it is, the undoubted &quot;star&quot; of the novel is the planet Perelandra.  There, Lewis creates not one world, but several distinct ecosystems: his unforgetable floating islands, (in Surprised by Joy and his autobiographical allegory Pilgrim's Regress Lewis describes how islands have been his symbol for paradise since childhood), the Fixed Lands, an undersea world of mermaids, an environment of caves, and finally the wonderfully complex world of the hero's shifting consciousness.  The inner dialogue before and during the climactic scenes falls nothing short of genius.  <br />I agree with the reviewer below that the beauty Lewis imagines brings it out and makes us notice the beauty around us.  As one of Lewis' favorite writers, G. K. Chesterton, put it, &quot;Nursery tales only echo an almost pre-natal leap of interest and amazement.  These tales make the rivers run with wine only to make us remember, for one wild moment, that they run with water.&quot;  As I walk through the bamboo groves of Japan, or remember skin-diving in Hawaii or camping in the Cascades, the effect that the bubble trees and night smells of Perelandra have on me similarly brings out the wonder of the earthly creation.  <br />As in all of Lewis' works, scene and plot are also the vehicle for the expression of philosophical ideas.  Lewis plays with speculation about the nature of primitive man, ideas about gender like the Chinese Yin Yang theory, and a scathing critique of monism.  (If, like Jim Jones or the Bagwan Rajneesh, his villain were a real person -- if that is the right term for them -- I suspect he too might be quite popular.) <br />I note with amusement the complaint below that Perelandra is overtly Christian.  Imagine that.  The famous Christian apologist allowing metaphysics to muddy up his sci-fi novel.  I wonder if people make the same complaints about Milton or Camus?  Not that I am comparing Lewis to them -- &quot;the same wave never comes twice&quot; and Lewis can stand on his own in any crowd.  Lewis may get a bit carried away at the end with his &quot;cosmic dance&quot; stuff; one of the book's few faults.  But if you are not interested in ultimate issues of right and wrong, God and human choice, why pick up a novel by C. S. Lewis?   <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-10-20

John is a man with an unusual combination of jobs.  During the day he is a bishop in the Anglican church.  At night he writes polemics against Christianity.  Thus his books satisfy a certain Jeckyl &amp; Hyde or man-bites-dog itch for the abnormal.  There are skeptics who write better, and there are Anglicans who write a whole lot better; but Spong appears to have cornered the market for Anglican skeptics at present.  <br />Generally I enjoy reading books written by skeptics and people of other religions who want to disprove Christianity.  I usually learn something, and I find the experience enhances my faith.  As Churchill said, it is exhilerating to be shot at without effect.  From that point of view, the problem with this book is, Spong's argument is so far off, I hardly got the feeling he was shooting at me to begin with.  I felt like a bungy jumper forced to jump off a coffee table.    <br />A great deal of Spong's argument is based on very simple philosophical and historical mistakes.  For example, it never seems to occur to him that one cannot refute a doctrine by refuting the imagery in which it is (inevitably) couched.  This distinction is as true of modern physics as of First Century religion.  One does not refute the existence of subatomic particles by poking fun at styrofoam balls.  But that is the level on which Spong lives, moves, and usually maintains his rhetorical being.       <br />A clue to the biggest problem with this book can be found in the index.  I could not find a single reference to any intelligent modern Christian.  Spong doesn't appear to have the slightest idea what educated Christians think, or why.  It is hard for me to take seriously the argument of a man who has not even troubled himself to read what the other side has to say, still less to respond.  Skeptics like Spong, Martin, Russell, and Armstrong almost seem too angry to think clearly, or to listen to contrary arguments.  <br />If you're looking for arguments against Christianity, there are  books that pack a wallop. Elie Wiesel's Night, for example, The Plague by Camus or Silence by Endo trouble my faith more deeply, (though Camus' caricature of Christianity was almost as bad as Spongs, and Endo was a Christian).  Those books get to the heart of my own doubts, without embarrassing me by so many contrived arguments and so much shoddy reasoning.  <br />If what you're looking for is truth, however, then I suggest you consider the argument for Christianity as presented by intelligent Christians.  C.S.Lewis, G.K.Chesterton, Vishal Mangalwadi, Richard Wurmbrand, Gary Habermas, R.C. Sproul, John Polkinghome, Hugh Ross, Don Richardson, would be a good place to start.  Lewis' essay Fernseed and Elephants, for example, ravages the whole foundation of Spong's approach to Scripture in four pages.  (Spong rather resembles two comic characters in Lewis: the Cockney skeptic in That Hideous Strength, and the hymn-humming clergyman on the bus from hell in The Great Divorce.) <br />Besides refuting many of Spong's errors, these thinkers present positive evidence for the faith that Spong appears never to have noticed.  They show that, in many ways, the case for Christianity has become stronger in the modern era.   <br />I also have a new book out, Jesus and the Religions of Man.  Among other things, the book seeks to put skeptical arguments like this one in the larger context of the approach other non-Christian religions take to the problem of Jesus.  I think skeptics may find the evidence I give in that book a stronger challenge than I, as a Christian, found here.	2000-10-19

For a lover of books who wants to know more from a critical thinker about modern Indian religion, for me finding this book was like a fisherman finding the river where the steelhead go for conventions.  Useful facts and ideas are packed head-to-tail here, so open the book with a pen handy, so you can mark where you want to cast your line on the next visit.  <br />Mangalwadi begins by describing the historical background from which the modern concept of guruism developed.  The next four parts, which make up the bulk of the book, describe eight or so gurus and the organizations they set up, including the Divine Light Mission, Hare Krishna, T.M., Sai Baba, Muktananda, and Rajneesh.  He balances a succinct discussion of each school's philosophy with the personal and moral (or, often, immoral) practices of its gurus.  There may be some troubling passages here for anyone who assumes that since monistic gurus rely upon &quot;direct revelation&quot; from a unified source of being, they therefore cannot conflict, and also for those who think that if you sense an aura of love around a person, he or she therefore has your best interests at heart.  While Vishal did not engage in mere sniping, and looked for the good in the gurus he described, I appreciated his concern for social justice and for truth that did often reveal itself in honest criticism.  I recommend this book to anyone who is attracted to the teachings of the Hindu gurus, and also to Christians who want to know more about the various schools of Hindu thought.  <br />I also found his depiction of Jesus in the last chapter as the Sanatan Sadguru a fitting and suggestive finish.  Unlike the Krishna devotee below, I did not find any problems with this book's understanding of Christian theology.  His description of Jesus as the Sanatan Sadguru is in line with the &quot;fulfillment&quot; model of Christian philosophy as expounded by Paul, John, Augustine, and modern authors such as G.K.Chesterton, C.S.Lewis, and Don Richardson.  <br />A book I just wrote, Jesus and the Religions of Man, takes a similar approach in regard to elements within Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Humanist and Marxist thought.  I also previously wrote a book about &quot;how Jesus fulfills the Chinese culture.&quot;  Whether you agree with this approach or not, it is both orthodox and has empirical justification.  I think Mangalwadi's approach is worth considering.    <br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-10-12

I had read Wilson's biographies of C.S.Lewis and Jesus before picking up this book, and found that while he was an excellent writer with an eye for telling detail, what the details told, tended to be what Wilson himself wanted to see.  He piled up non-sequitors like foot stools to reach shaky conclusions.  He mistook his own wild guesses for established fact.  And most of all, he seemed glibly unaware of threatening counter-arguments.  <br />God's Funeral is not free of such faults.  However, I can't deny the book is a good read; full of interesting character sketches and iconoclastic ideas.  You can do much worse on a rainy day.  <br />I am not sure the Victorian era was altogether the spiritual watershed Wilson portrayed it as.  For example, after depicting the loss of faith of a number of intellectuals raised in Christian homes, supposedly the greatest thinkers of the day, he alleged that even the prominent Christian Prime Minister William Gladstone toned down his faith during this period.  But it was Gladstone who noted, presumably late in his career, that, &quot;I have known 95 of the world's great men in my time, and of those, 87 were followers of the Bible.&quot;  No doubt Gladstone's definition of &quot;great&quot; was influenced by his beliefs; but so was Wilson's.  Some of the important figures Wilson describes here, like Marx, Bertrand Russell, and George Sand, have elsewhere been very convincingly described as flakes.  (See Paul Johnson, Intellectuals, for example.) Gladstone's comment reminds us that Wilson catches only a very constricted view of modern faith, like the frog in the Chinese story who looks at the sky out of a well and thinks he has seen the world.  <br />In Wilson's view, evidence against the truth of Christianity that began to accumulate in the 19th Century, such as Darwin's theory of Evolution and Biblical criticism, terminally undermined the basis for belief.  Modern Christians who ignore that evidence are, he thinks, fooling themselves with sophistry (evangelicals) or willing themselves to believe despite the evidence (liberals).  The problem with this generalization, while it may accurately describe individual cases on all sides, is that it does not take into account opposing phenomena; areas of evidence that have increased the credibility of the Christian faith as the modern era wore on.  (And which parallel the continued growth and spread of the world-wide church, about which Wilson is fairly subdued.)  Exit the well, and look in other directions, and you are likely to notice such things as: the Anthropic Principle, the failure of radical New Testament criticism (Crossan, Funk, Wilson himself) to come up with a credible materialistic explanation for the Gospels, the surprising complexity of even &quot;primitive&quot; life, (which of Darwin's atheist contemporaries thought we'd still be looking for a way for life to emerge from non-life at the turn of the millenia?), the long-prophecied return of the Jewish people to Israel, the surprisingly univeral nature of the Christian concept of God, the undermining of mechanistic models in physics, or the folly and destruction of Marxist, Nazi, sexual, and aquarian revolts against orthodox morality.  In addition, many modern believers (including myself) have seen God answer prayer in remarkable ways.  All these are among the empirical evidences that have driven many thoughtful people toward, rather than away from, belief.   <br />On the other hand, much of the prima facia evidence against God on which modern skeptics set such store, such as suffering and the regularity of natural law, have been familiar throughout history; even the apostles expressed such doubts.  So I find these generalizations from historical periods rather dubious; and I am tempted to wonder if there are really more atheists now than there were hundreds of years ago, or if they just have better jobs.<br />God's Funeral is not a bad read.  But if you find the philosophy that underliesit persuasive, let me challenge you to read a book I just wrote as well, called Jesus and the Religions of Man.  While completed just before I read God's Funeral, it gives an empirical argument for the Christian faith that I think any skeptic who sees only what Wilson sees, broadening.  If, after reading it, you don't agree, send the book back, and I'll refund what you paid for it.  <br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-10-04

I read this book (on the suggestion of an astronomer) about the same time as Bertrand Russell's Why I am Not a Christian, in which Russell baldly asserts that &quot;There is no evidence of design&quot; about the universe.  Creator and the Cosmos lays that idea to rest, with a thud.  <br />One possible loophole in Ross' argument, however, may be as follows.  In order to calculate the probability of an event, (such as the birth of life, or a bio-friendly universe) you need to be able to calculate not only all the possible outcomes (which can be done, Ross shows, producing very big numbers).  You also need to be able to calculate the number that are favorable.  (All the possible bio-scraps that can reproduce, what life might be possible under other conditions.  If other fundamental constants were different, for example, might there be more boron,?  Or might some other element attain characteristics that allowed it to take over where carbon left off?)  To calculate how all the possible outcomes might affect life in some other form, at least at this stage, seems impossible, but that does not mean the question is absurd.  When John Maddox of Nature suggests something like that, Ross dismisses him too quickly, in my opinion.  <br />Still, the evidence Ross offers is at least powerfully suggestive. He certainly does show that the old complain about a &quot;God of the gaps&quot; has now been turned on its head.  <br />I agree with reviewers who think Ross overreached in arguing for Christianity from evidence that merely suggest the existence of God.  I believe in Jesus, but not because of the Big Bang!  To a certain extent, I think Ross might be copying the error of his opponents, making &quot;new scientific evidence&quot; into a fetish, as if it cancelled out all prior human experience -- as if God's existence and character were knowable only to 21st Century astronomers and their readers!  I have found strong evidence for the existence of God, and for specific Christian doctrines, in many other sources: history, prophecy, answered prayer, (including in my own life), miracles, and even in my study of some lesser-known (yet very important) currents in so-called eastern thought and beliefs.  It seems to me a tad parochial to discuss ultimate questions about the cosmos without noting the cosmological evidence right under our noses.  (Planet earth, after all, is part of the cosmos.)  The Absent-Minded Professor syndrome, I guess.  One can't fault Ross for getting exciting about his discipline.  This is a truly amazing book about a remarkable subject; and if you can relate to the story Ross tells about his childhood, when he pointed a telescope his father gave him at the stars, and all the neighbors gathered around to look, it's even better.<br />I've just written a book, Jesus and the Religions of Man, that gives more down-to-earth, and sometimes less-familiar, evidence for the Christian faith.  For those interested in how Christianity relates to other beliefs, and some of that evidence, you may find my book a good complement to The Creator and the Cosmos.	2000-09-20

The first time I read this book, I felt almost as impatient with Chesterton's &quot;verbosity&quot; and &quot;hot air&quot; as some of the reviewers below.  In regard to the bare facts of Francis' life, one comes  to feel a bit as Chesterton said of the Troubadours' lovers: &quot;The  reader realises that the lady is the most beautiful being that can possibly  exist, only he has occasional doubts as to whether she does exist.&quot;   Moments came when I found myself thirsting for dry facts.  But I think the  problem is that Chesterton assumes his readers, as educated persons of his  period, know the story already, and only need to be enlightened as to its  meaning.  One can get facts anywhere.  Few can take us inside the thinking  of a man like Francis.  And absolutely no one I know writes with such  entertaining flair, of a healing kind so different from modern books and  movies that wound our souls with their pleasures.  <br />On second reading, I  find I enjoyed this episode about as much as the biography of Dickens --  which  was very much.  Chesterton looks at Francis, in varying cadences,  from the inside, to help us think and feel as he did, then from the  outside, as children of the Enlightenment, a two-perspective approach that  gives us a rounded figure.  Those of us who have no other knowledge of  Francis may sometimes wonder how much of that figure is Francis and how  much Chesterton, (who was, after all, probably the more rounded of the  two).  But the insights are always brilliant.  And many still cut like  daggers. (Or rather scalpels, to heal.) &quot;We read that Admiral Bangs  has been shot, which is the first intimation we have that he has ever been  born.&quot;  &quot;The moment sex ceases to be a servant it becomes a  tyrant.&quot;  &quot;All goods look better when they look like gifts.&quot;   &quot;There is only one intelligent reason why a man does not believe in  miracles and that is that he does believe in materialism.&quot;  Anyone who  finds such digressions merely &quot;hot air,&quot; would be best advised to  keep to dry-as-dust historical commentaries, or skeptical comic books, as  the case may be.  <br />This book is not so much a biography of a single man,  as an episode in Chesterton's ongoing spiritual biography of mankind.  It  is one in a series of what Solzhenitsyn called &quot;knots&quot; and Thomas  Cahill calls &quot;hinges&quot; of history.  The series continues with  Chesterton's equally subjective but enlightening biographies of Chaucer,  Dickens, Joan of Arc, and modern &quot;Heretics.&quot;  He gives the  outline of the project in the Everlasting Man, which is one of the most  brilliant and wisest books of the century. <br />As a non-Catholic Christian  (&quot;Protestant&quot; would place the emphasis in the wrong place), I  don't agree with Chesterton's take on the Albigensian Wars, and am more  ambivalent about the Crusades than he.  But he does not exactly justify the  Inquisition, as the reader below implies; he admits that in later stages it  was a &quot;horrible thing that might be haunted by demons.&quot;  How many  modern leftists admitted that much about, say, the Russian Revolution?  But  I agree he may try to &quot;understand&quot; the sins committed by his side  a little too hard.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man (July  2000)<br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-07-11

As a person who takes spirituality seriously, I found The Spiritual Tourist a fascinating romp through the occult playgrounds of the world, east and west.  Some ... praise Brown for taking a proper &quot;middle path&quot; between faith and reason.  I found, on the contrary, that he was  often frivolously gullible where clarity of thought was demanded, and  obtusely boneheaded where reason really might encourage faith, were he  willing to dig a little deeper.  (Well, a lot deeper.)  Nevertheless, most  of the book is a very enlightening and entertaining journey.  (Those who  would like to see a more thorough expose of Sai Baba, might also enjoy the  somewhat sensationalist but fascinating Avatar of Night.) <br />As one reads  through Brown's accounts of eastern gurus, and also books like Philip  Johnson's Intellectuals, which tell the stories of Western Humanist gurus  (whom Johnson compares unfavorably to witchdoctors) like Sartre, Rousseau,  Tolstoy, and Marx, it is easy to get the impression that religion is a  racket.  You find a few good people in it -- Confucius, the Dalai Lama,  Gandhi, Francis -- but even they are driven to some pretty strange  conclusions by their beliefs (an enlightened master would be someone who  would drink alcohol or urine with equal equanimity?). . . and they are  least likely to do miracles or make extreme claims.  Except one, that is,  who is the most sagely of all (the best sages call him their sage), yet  makes the most remarkable claims and revealed the greatest power.  Brown  conflates this guru with Baba, but I cannot think of two people who are  more different.  Nor do his miracles at all resemble Baba's silly and  sub-natural conjuring tricks.  <br />I am a very skeptical person by nature.   I have been a follower of that guru for 25 years, and have been studying  comparative religion for 14.  I find Buddha attractive, the Bhagavad Gita,  Lao Zi and Zhuang Zi clever, I see Marx' point, and admire Tolstoy, and  have like Browninterviewed a few modern gurus as well.  But it never  entered my head that these gurus were any more than mortal; and nothing  Brown said suggested that to me, either.  The more I see of most of this  crowd, the more startling and absolute the contrast with this other guru  seems to become.  There is one moment in Spiritual Pilgrims when Brown  meets an old Indian scholar who is a follower of Sai Baba.  He admits  himself &quot;baffled&quot; by the records of that other guru.  &quot;If he  did not exist, then it is a miracle that someone could have made up a story  like this,&quot; he says.  The people of his own time said the same:  &quot;No one ever spoke as this man,&quot; &quot;No one ever did the things  he did.&quot;<br />Brown does not follow this lead, but taking a naive and  simplistic approach to faith and reason,   still inclined to wander, comes  to a fusion conclusion somewhere between Buddha and Voltaire. Each of us  must save ourselves.  All right.  But can we really do that?  Do we love  God with all our heart, soul, and strength, and our neighbor as ourselves?   Is life without God a party?  How does death fit into the grand tour?  Can  we waterski the River Styx?  Hang glide from the Pearly Gates?  Even Indian  tradition, that teaches the gods themselves cannot change karma, encouraged  bathing in the Ganges, worship of gurus, and sacrifice, because people felt  inside themselves they could not cover their own karma, but needed help.   Brown's problem seems to be he is a tourist, and has not yet become serious  about looking for truth. <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of  Man	2000-07-11

Death of a Guru is not a systematic argument against Hinduism, despite the  impression you might get from some of the reviewers below.  Rather, it is  the story of the author's conversion from Krishna to Christ, a spiritual  biography with zip, drama, and controversy.  The only systematic part of  the book is the (very helpful) glossary of Hindu terms in the back.   <br />Admittedly, Rabi gives a very negative view of India and Hinduism.  I  would also recommend Gandhi's Autobiography, for a very different and  equally interesting picture, yet which I do not think negates anything in  this book.  Another gripping autobiography that follows the same track as  Rabi, in India itself, is Tal Brooke's Avatar of Night.  <br />My fields are  East Asian religions and Marxism; I'm not an expert on Hinduism.  But a lot  of what Rabi says rings true as far as how developed monist philosophy  filters down to the common folks.  At the same time, I am sure there are  things in Indian culture that a Christian can affirm as well.  I have just  finished writing a book called Jesus and the Religions of Man.  In that  book, I discuss briefly the idea of God in Indian culture.  I also discuss  some very startling verses in the Rig Veda that seem to point to the death  of Christ on the cross.  I think people on both sides of the &quot;review  debate&quot; below will find these passages of interest. <br />No doubt there  are other positive features and &quot;redemptive analogies&quot; within  Indian culture.  As Christians, I believe we should affirm all aspects of  truth.  Rabi's story presents a particular challenge to those who would say  that all religions lead up the same mountain.  It is natural that some  reviewers find it upsetting; but    I think Rabi give many important  aspects of the truth here.  <br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-07-10

This book comes in an unusual long, narrow shape, as if to emphasize the unorthodox character of Crossan's approach.  His argument is well-written and adorned with interesting background details, and even some good  insights.  But as a whole, I found that argument far more of a stretch than  the book itself.   <br />Crossan begins by begging the question.  Suppose, he  asks, you wanted to go behind the &quot;screen&quot; of &quot;credal  interpretation&quot; that are the Gospels for an impartial account of the  historical Jesus &quot;as distinct from the confessional Christ?&quot;   (Yes.  But what if we first ask if the two are distinct, before we ask how  they are distinct?)  Crossan dismisses academics who come to orthodox  conclusions as phoney scholars.  But if, on that account, you expect a  dispassionate and scholarly approach from Crossan, don't hold your breath.   <br />Crossan makes two assumptions in regard to Biblical material.  1) Don't  trust materials from after 60 A.D. 2) No argument should stand on the  strength of only one independent attestation.  With that, unfortunately, a  vast amount of non-Jesus seminar history slides into the abyss.  The life  of Confucius, for example, has only one near source, the Analects.  Yet the  vast majority of scholars believe, on the grounds of internal evidence of  that source, that we have a basically reliable record of Confucius' life  and teachings.  (For reasons that apply even more strongly in the case of  the Gospels.) Furthermore, the Mencius, written more than a hundred years  later, is thought to contain accurate information about his life.   <br />Unlike Confucius, Jesus died young, and his followers were no doubt  younger, and could easily have lived well past Crossan's arbitrary date.   If my grandmother, who wrote poetry to the age of 95, had been the little  girl Jesus raised from the dead, she could have written a first-hand  account of the incident in 105 A.D.  Living here in Nagasaki, Japan, wereI  to write an account of the nuclear holocaust 55 years later (=80 A.D.), I  wouldn't even have to look for eyewitnesses, still in perfect health and  with perhaps decades left to live.  So it seems to me these two assumptions  are fine pieces of nonsense.  <br />Crossan also commits gross fallacies of  classification.  For example, he says most Galilean peasants were  illiterate.  Jesus was a peasant; therefore he believes (despite Gospel  accounts to the contrary) Jesus was illiterate.  Consider what we can do  with this method.  Mohatma Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln were lawyers.  Most  lawyers are dishonest.  Therefore Lincoln and Gandhi were untruthful.  It  staggers me to think a respected professor could call such an absurd piece  of reasoning &quot;scholarship.&quot;<br />Crossan also liberally employs the  age-old method of &quot;reading between the lines&quot; that C.S.Lewis so  crushingly rebuked in his classic (and still devastating) essay, Fernseed  and Elephants.  Josephus and the Apostle John both wrote about John the  Baptist.  Crossans adds the two accounts, psychoanalyzes the principles,  assumes they were lying about whatever facts they relate that fit their  theologies, then fills the resulting holes with what he thinks they must  have been covering up.  Based on no real evidence, and denying what  evidence we have, he concludes that John the Baptist was &quot;not talking  about Jesus at all&quot; but was an &quot;apocalyptic preacher&quot;  announcing the arrival of an &quot;imperial conquerer.&quot;  &quot;We can  almost guess what John must have been doing by reading between the  lines.&quot;  Of course we can, if we are endowed with such powers as John  Crossan.  We can even deduce &quot;a huge web of apocalyptic expectations,  a network of ticking timebombs all over the Jewish homeland&quot; that was  the following of the Baptist, whether they leave trace in the historical  record or not.  Come on, John.  At least Joseph Smith had peep stonesto  work with.  <br />Such are Crossan's usual methods of reasoning.  Were I to  give all such examples, to paraphrase the apostle John, the World Wide Web  itself might not contain all the evidences of Crossan's preturnatural  powers.  I cringe to think what my professors in grad school would have  said if I had turned in arguments of the sort Crossan habitually employs.   <br />But in one sense, Crossan deserves his audience.  He has created a  useful myth with footnotes, a well-written and resourceful Humanist  apocrypha that can be hugely useful to those who share his creed.   <br />Revolutionary Biography fits into a long tradition of religious spin  doctors who sanitize Jesus for their various constituencies.  For those who  are interested in that tradition (and it is a very interesting story) my  new book Jesus and the Religions of Man discusses the Humanist  &quot;historical Jesus&quot; in the larger context of Buddhist, Muslim,  Hindu, Marxist, and Mormon tall tales about Jesus.  <br />A few reviewers  below argue that &quot;No one can know what Jesus really said or did.&quot;   I think, on the contrary, everyone can know.  I do not think anyone would  have made up the Gospel accounts as we have them. I don't think anyone  could have made them up.  Not everyone likes the Jesus who appears in them,  but then, not everyone liked Jesus in person, either.  Everyone had reason  to disbelieve.  Books like Crossan's are evidence that the world has come a  long way since then in dealing with the problem of Jesus, in terms of  scholarly refinement.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of  Man<br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-07-09

Mankind has left the planet earth, about to be engulfed by the explosion of the sun, in spaceships that fanned out around the galaxy, the passengers sleeping for hundreds of years until reaching habitable planets.  A new ship with its cargo of a million Sleeping Beautys has reached the planet  Thalassa, an island surrounded by ocean.  This civilization enjoys all the  virtues and the gentler vices of the South Sea islands, with neither God  (belief in whom had done mankind &quot;more evil than good&quot;) nor  sexual jealousy.  (Clarke goes to pains to emphasize his book is science  fiction, rather than fantasy, but when it comes to human nature he allows  himself a dose of utopian fantasy.)     <br />There is not much of a plot here  in the ordinary sense of the word.  But the pictures Clarke evokes of the  death of our planet, colonization of others in a slow-motion diaspora, of  islands in a sea of potentially hostile blue, made the book well worth the  read for me.  Clarke's planet is less exotic and more ominous than  C.S.Lewis' water-world of Perelandra; his literary and psychological  imagination less acute, but more scientifically disciplined.    <br />As a  student of comparative religion, I was interested in how faith fared in  Clarke's 27th Century.  Clarke allows vestiges of a vague deism among a  specialist or two, but the idea of a God who answers prayer has long since  been ruled out by &quot;statistical theology,&quot; which shows that good  things happen to good (and bad) people just as often as you would expect by  the laws of chance.  This seems a bit feeble to me; I personally have had  experiences that would take a tremendous number of unanswered prayers to  flatten on the statistic curve.  Another interesting touch is that one of  the refugees has brought with him a tooth of the Buddha, because he  &quot;founded the only religion that never became stained with blood.&quot;   This was a nice touch, artistically.  But I get the impression Clarke,between writing novels and doing science, had little time left to learn  much about the real religious history of East or West, as opposed to  rubber-stamping popular skeptical prejudices.

Unlike a couple readers below, I was pleasantly surprised to find this a very readable and well-written story.  I felt like I was meeting the great reformer in person, with no interpreters or spin doctors between us.  <br />Gandhi surprised me with his transparency.  He honestly expresses doubts  about (or limited awareness of) God, his own weaknesses, and the  mistreatment of women in Hinduism.  He frankly relates quarrels with his  wife (&quot;numerous bickerings&quot; that end in peace, with the wife the  victor -- I wonder about that part, though) and that his son disagreed with  his ascetic lifestyle.  I gave this book five stars not because I agree  with all of Gandhi's ideas, but because he explains them well, the stories  he tells are so interesting, because the search for truth is what life is  all about, and because Gandhi is one of the great figures of the 20th  Century.  <br />A couple years ago I did a research paper on the young Mao  Zedong.  One thing that surprised me here was to find that, despite their  very different attitudes about violence, the fathers of the world's two  biggest modern states shared much in common.  Both agreed that &quot;the  life of labor is the only life worth living,&quot; and founded communes  with friends as young men.  Both strengthened themselves through ascetic  self-disciplines.  Both were men of contemplation and action.  Both shared  an ambivalent relation to the party that was the vehicle of their success,  yet were also masters at the use of power.  Both freed their countries from  foreign domination over many decades, by use of dialectic strategy and an  appeal to the peasants.  <br />Gandhi was a man of ideas and of action, and  also I think of passion, despite his philosophical commitment to  &quot;desirelessness.&quot;  I found the book engaging on all three levels,  though I also was disappointed that it ended without relating later actions  in the history of India's movement towards independence.<br />Gandhiseemed to  live with a great deal of guilt, which he relates to the death of his  father, revealed in his attitude towards sex and eating. &quot;Renunciation  without aversion is not lasting,&quot; he quotes a pundit.  He seemed to  feel life itself was occasion for guilt.  &quot;Man cannot for a moment  live without commiting outward himsa, destruction of life.&quot;  In this  regard, of course, Gandhi and Mao were opposites, the latter embracing an  ideology that encouraged him to locate guilt in the other, the former one  by which he took on the guilt of others.  <br />As a Christian, one of the  most interesting parts of the book was his visit to the temple to Kali.  He  was horrified by the animal sacrifices he saw.  &quot;To my mind the life  of a lamb is no less precious than that of a human being,&quot; he noted.   &quot;I must go through more self-purification and sacrifice, before I can  hope to save these lambs . . . .&quot;  He said he prayed constantly that  &quot;some great spirit&quot; of a person would bring an end to these  &quot;immoral&quot; sacrifices.  Yet the people doing the sacrifices were  themselves looking for a solution to the same problem of guilt that haunted  Gandhi, as well as Tolstoy, his hero.  <br />This shows that the wisdom of  Gandhi was not all the wisdom of India, still less of humanity.  The Rig  Veda says that sacrifice is &quot;the mainstay of the world&quot; and the  only way to find forgiveness of sins.  It spoke of a God who would  sacrifice himself for the sins of the people, in prophetic imagery  remarkably similar to the events recorded in the Gospels.  And, when Jesus  died, animals were no longer sacrificed.  I wonder if it ever occurred to  Gandhi that his prayer for lambs (not to mention guilt-ridden people) had  already been answered at the cross?<br />author, Jesus and the Religions of  Man<br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-07-08

Johnson has, in these 750 pages, assigned himself a difficult task: to  step back from the era in which he lives and write a story that gives  proper proportion to events and personalities, as if from a distance.   (Like making a map of a mountainous region from sea level.)  Furthermore,  to make it interesting to a contemporary audience, many of whom will have  personal familiarity with particular aspects of that history.  I felt he  succeeded very well.  It is a work of incredible breadth and insight.  I  found this book not only good reading, but insightful and fresh even when  he talked about subjects that I am familiar with.  Of course, Johnson did  not make any pretense of stepping back from modern history in a polemic  sense: he tells 'em as he sees 'em, and sees them from a conservative  Burkian standpoint.  But his praise and censure seems more fairly  distributed here than in Intellectuals.  <br />The heart of the story,  alongside many subplots, is, it seems, the rise and fall of the great  secular religions, such as Marxism, Fascism, and Naziism.  Johnson takes  what seems to me a rather weak and unhelpful stab at relating these  political developments to concurrent scientific developments.  It is also  odd to me that, with all his talk about ideology, he says very little about  trends in religion, except for Islam.  He does not seem to have noticed the  rise of the New Age movement in the West, or of Christianity in Africa,  parts of Asia, and (in evangelical form) in Latin America.

But since I first read the book about seventeen years ago, I have  found confirmation on three levels.  First, Scriptural.  Richardson's idea  of &quot;redemptive analogies&quot; indirectly echoes the teaching of Jesus  that he came &quot;to fulfill&quot; rather than to &quot;do away with&quot;  the (Jewish) Law, and, more directly, the approach the apostles John and  Paul in speaking to Greeks about the divine &quot;Logos,&quot; or about  altars &quot;to an unknown God.&quot;  Second, historical.  In Augustine's  City of God, Christ was preached as a fulfillment of the truest elements in  Greco-Roman culture in the early church.  This is in fact a large part of   &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; to Christ, and a large part of the East,  as well.    <br />The third form of confirmation was psychological, from the  mouths of skeptics.  Humanist Huston Smith complains of Christianity that  &quot;If God is a God of love, it seems most unlikely that he would not  have revealed himself to his other children as well.&quot;  Buddhist Thich  Naht Hanh agrees: &quot;Sharing does not mean wanting others to abandon  their spiritual roots. . . People cannot be happy if they are  rootless.&quot;  Both are quite right, as far as they go.  But Richardson  shows that God has revealed himself to &quot;all his children&quot; by  planting a root for the Gospel within each culture, so when we call people  to Christ, we call them to the deepest truths within their own cultures.       I remember the first time I visited the Temple of Heaven in Beijing,  China, 16 years ago.  Who was this &quot;Heaven&quot; whom the Chinese  worshiped?  Why did the emperor come once a year, just like the high priest  in Israel, to sacrifice for the sins of the people?  As I stood in the most  sacred spot in China, it seemed as if a Voice spoke to my heart.  &quot;Do  you think I just came to China with the missionaries?  No.  I have been  here all along.  I made China.&quot;  <br />Many years of research in China  confirmed this to me.  Among the tribal cultures of southern China and  Taiwan, the Polynesians, and China itself, I came across many examples that  confirmed Richardson's thesis.  Later, I wrote a book called True Son of  Heaven: How Jesus Fulfills the Chinese Culture, and spoke around the  Pacific Rim on the subject.  People in the audience often pointed out  further examples of this thesis.  <br />Eternity in Their Hearts has been  tremendously influential among missionaries.  But I think it is a book that  everyone should read, including non-Christians who ask questions like those  of Smith and Hahn.  Read the book, and pass it on to a friend.  <br />If you  are interested in a more philosophical approach to the issue, try  Chesterton's Everlasting Man and Orthodoxy.  &quot;Redemptive  analogies&quot; are also a latent theme of many of C.S.Lewis' books:  Surprised by Joy, Mere Christianity, Pilgrims Regress, and most intriguing  of all, Till We Have Faces.  <br />I've also just finished writing a book  called Jesus and the Religions of Man.  The book is not exclusively about  redemptive analogies; mainly, it is a general argument for the Christian  faith.  But if you're interested in learning more about how persistent and  coherent the idea of God is in the pagan cultures of the world, you'll find  some interesting examples in there.  I also give more examples of  redemptive analogies that center on the person of  Jesus and on his work on  the cross.  Many of these come from the more civilized cultures of Asia,  and also Marxist, psychologist, feminist, and tribal sub-cultures of  Western civilization.<br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-07-06

Ivan Shukhov is a soldier, trademan, and prisoner in Stalin's Gulag.  One Day is the chronicle of a single, more-or-less successful winter day of his term in prison.  Ivan awakens, eats slop, runs errands for other prisoners  to supplement that slop, and works with his team to build a wall.  Among  his fellow prisoners Solzhenitsyn has placed individual representatives of  the various types that inhabited the Gulag: members of inconvenient  nationalities, intellectuals, communist hacks (unflatteringly incarnated in  the parasitical figure of Fetiukov), a few genuine criminals, and an  evangelical Christian named Alyosha.  (If the views of the latter on  suffering seem a bit different from those you hear from American  Christians, especially of the health-and-wealth variety, so much the worse  for us, perhaps.)<br />In this, his first published work, Solzhenitsyn  revealed the brilliance of a great Russian novelist.  Human nature is  tested by the most adverse conditions and comes alive.  Ironically,  tyranical policies often did have the positive effect both in Russia and in  China, of breaking down barriers between intellectuals and the plebes to  reveal the common humanity of both -- in the end, to the sorrow of the  regime.  One subtle and ironic example of Solzhenitsyn's realism is the  pleasure his presumable &quot;enemy of the working class&quot; hero finds  even in work in a Siberian slave labor camp.<br />While First Circle is my  favorite of Solzhenitsyn's books, and Gulag is one of the most powerful  works of our time, One Day is a small gem, a perfectly realized portrait.  Actually it is not a picture of slave labor, or even communism; like all  great literature, it is about life itself, and what it means to be a moral  being.  For an interesting contrast to Solzhenitsyn's bitterly ironic but  ultimately life-affirming chronicle, read One Day in tandem with The  Plague, written by fellow Nobel Prize lauriette Albert Camus.  Camus' novel  about a town thathas become prisoner to bubonic plague takes place in a  larger camp, but in my opinion a smaller universe, than the world of Ivan  Denisovich, still less of Alyosha.<br />Krushchev may have threatened us  over Cuba, and banged his shoe on the table in the UN, but he also  permitted publication of this novel.  Here's to his health, wherever he  is.<br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-07-06

In Life of Johnson, Boswell brings up the name of Johnson's one-time sparing partner, Edmund Burke.  Johnson, being quite sick, and not given to easy praise, admits, &quot;Yes, Burke is an extraordinary man.&quot;   Boswell tries to coax a more quotable reply, and Johnson, who thought  argument the sole end of conversation, finally noted, &quot;That fellow  calls forth all my powers.  Were I to see Burke now, it would kill  me.&quot;   <br />Reflections on the Revolution in France should not be a  killer read for most, but is difficult in spots.  Many of the sentences are  long and complex, written in an age when thought and rhetoric had not yet  been corroded by sound bites.  Some of the topics may seem a bit obscure  now.  But this is undoubtedly a great book, by a great man, thinking  lucidly and passionately about great issues.  It is indeed a work of great  intellectual power.  At the same time, it is also a work of moral passion,  balance, and foresight, often eloquently and sometimes simply expressed.   <br />Much of it is also remarkably timely.  Not only did Burke seem to  anticipate the extremes to which the French Revolution was tending, the  great Marxist revolutions of our times also often greatly resemble his  remarks.  &quot;It is a suffient motive to destroy an old scheme of things,  because it is an old one.&quot;  &quot;Kings will be tyrants from policy  when subjects are rebels from principle.&quot;  &quot;Criminal means once  tolerated are soon preferred. . . Justifying perfidy and murder for the  public benefit, public benefit will soon become the pretext, and perfidy  and murder the end.&quot;  Examples could be multiplied.  Reading the book,  the subsequent history not only of communism, but also of progressive  social cults in the West, becomes more comprehensible.<br />I prefer to think  of Burke primarily in moral or spiritual terms, rather than political.   Burke remarks, anticipating Rank and Becker and preempting Marx's silly  economic heresy, (and anticipating Marxist personality cults) &quot;Man is  by his constitution a religious animal.&quot;  One of the attractive things  about Burke to me is his non-sectarian faith; he spoke from a viewpoint  C.S.Lewis later described as &quot;Mere Christianity.&quot;  Some of his  insights also parallel those of the Chinese philosopher, Confucius.  What  the two men shared was intellectual accuity combined with humility that  expressed itself as a willingness to sit at the feet of teachers of the  past.  &quot;We know that we have made no discoveries; and we think that no  discoveries are to be made, in morality.&quot;  That is one pole within the  orthodox Christian approach to morality; God has &quot;placed eternity in  our hearts;&quot; the Tao is universal, as Lewis argued.<br />Burke's argument  may go too far at times; surely some of the changes wrought by the French  Revolution were for the good, and there is something to be said for the  moral passion of the revolutionary.  And not every paragraph is interesting  to me.  Still, overall, the balance and sanity of this book remain not just  as a monument to the powers of its author, but as useful resource to anyone  who thinks about the relation of power and morality.  Solomon said,  &quot;Pride comes before a fall.&quot;  This book is, in some ways, a  prophetic and wise meditation on the social consequences of that deep  truth.  <br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man (July 2000)  d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-07-05

Cannibals and headhunters, the Sawi of New Guinea little fit the old image of &quot;noble savages.&quot;  At the same time, Richardson describes them  not merely as savages, noble or otherwise, but as individuals whom he  invites us to know and recognize as fellow human beings.  He gives a  picture of them not only as headhunters, but also as naturalists,  linguists, and myth-makers.  <br />Richardson is an excellent story-teller.   In this story, of course, he is one of the protagonists.  He and his wife  believed themselves called to bring the Gospel to the Sawi people.   Richardson is an actor in this drama, potential recipient of the action of  crocodiles, tropical disease, and natives, and also (he believes)agent of  God's grace.  No second-hand outline of history, here we can read the  spiritual story of one of the thousands of tongues and tribes and races of  man, as it happens.  <br />One of the central questions of our time is how  universal truth relates to the heritage of each culture.  No evangelical  has done more to help Christians understand the Biblical answer than Don  Richardson.  Richardson introduces the concept of &quot;redemptive  analogies&quot; in this book. This is the idea that God has prepared the  cultures of the world for the Gospel by planting seeds of truth in them.   (A concept developed by John and Paul, Clement, Augustine, G.K.Chesterton,  and C.S.Lewis.)  He tells the story of how the Gospel changed the Sawi  culture from within.  Peace Child is thus both a wonderful true story, and  also introduces a paradigm-shifting mind-blowing concept of the first  order.  This is a great &quot;missions&quot; book, but I also recommend it  to non-Christians who are trying to understand how the Christian revelation  relates to other cultures.  (And also those who just want to understand  tribal cultures.)<br />Don Richardson discusses redemptive analogies in  passing again in his even more thrilling story, Lords of the Earth.  Then  he extends his argument, or story, in Eternity in Their Hearts -- and in my  opinion, you can hardly say you have considered Christianity until you have  read that book.  <br />I have also written a couple books applying the same  principles to the great Asian civilizations.  The first, True Son of  Heaven: How Jesus Fulfills the Chinese Culture, discusses the Gospel and  Chinese art, faith, philosophy, and language.  In the second, Jesus and the  Religions of Man, I show how Jesus both fulfills and challenges the ideals  of Buddhist, Hindu, Humanist, Marxist, and Muslim faiths.  This book is due  July 2000, and is available through Amazon.  <br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-07-03

I give Thich four stars not because I think he knows much aboutJesus, nor because I think he has tried very hard to understand, butbecause he gives a winning explanation of Buddhism.  (Especially in the philosophical and moral form Westerners are most likely to find attractive.)  Many of his insights are of value to anyone, including Christians, particularly in regard to mindfulness.  There is a great deal of psychological truth to be found here, though I sometimes doubt the author's commitment to ultimate truth about reality.  <br />Such doubts pull at me from the text of this book.  &quot;For a Buddhist to be attached to any doctrine, even a Buddhist one, is to betray the Buddha.&quot; Yet Thich never seems to question own &quot;non-doctrinal&quot; doctrines, including this one.  Thich defines his beliefs as &quot;insights&quot; as opposed to &quot;doctrines,&quot; and seems to embrace them all the more tightly. Perhaps that is the advantage of calling them &quot;insights.&quot; If I say &quot;I believe x,&quot; one can argue with that, but if I say, &quot;I see x,&quot; no further argument is possible.  <br />Thich also habitually interprets Christian Scripture in a way that radically changes its meaning.  &quot;Be still and know that I am God,&quot; comes to mean, not awareness of the Creator who made us, as to the Psalmist, but the opposite, an erasing of boundaries between Creator and created.  When Jesus said &quot;I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life,&quot; Thich similarly takes the bite out of his words: &quot;The I in his statement is life itself.&quot; In fact, of course, when Jesus said &quot;I,&quot; he meant himself, as do we all.  But Thich is not willing to face Jesus on his own terms, so there is a continuous undercurrent of spin-doctoring whenever Thich opens the Gospels.  He even has the gall to rebuke the Pope for misunderstanding Christianity in saying that Jesus is &quot;unique&quot; and &quot;the one mediator between God and man.&quot; Actually, of course, it is Thich who misunderstand Jesus' words on the subject, with cold premeditation.  Thich is attached to his doctrine of non-attachment, so he cannot take Christianity as is, but reduces it to one of Buddha's 80,000 paths to nirvana.  That is a perenial temptations of monism.  But the Dalai Lama, who seems more willing to allow the other to be other, seems more truly openminded to me.  <br />I agree with Thich that no mortal has a &quot;monopoly on the truth.&quot; I think it is simplistic however to say that people &quot;kill and are killed because they cling too tightly to their own beliefs.&quot; People murder for all kinds of reasons, sometimes because they have no faith, sometimes because they have faith in the wrong thing, sometimes because they have the wrong kind of faith in the right thing.  Let us not squelch our desire for truth with such sweeping and simplistic generalizations.  I think Thich understands the words of Buddha, from a particular point of view, fairly well.  But if we are really going to gain from one another's viewpoints, I think we need to listen to the words of Christ more forthrightly than Thich shows to have done here.  In the end, Thich's version of Jesus is no more honest to the Gospels than the outlandish stories of Jesus going to the Himilayas to learn magic.  G.K.Chesterton once remarked on Buddhists making the two teachings equal, &quot;especially Buddhism.&quot; He noted, by contrast: &quot;An open mind, like an open mouth,is meant to be closed on something solid.&quot; I don't fault Thich for being closed-minded, but I do fault him for not realizing it, and for closing his mind without really considering Jesus' claim to be the solid Truth whose acts in history are the goal of human seeking.  I would also dispute his assumption that Christianity has no &quot;roots&quot; in Asian culture.  In fact, (and I know this will sound absurd to most people) I argue that its roots go much deeper into many Asian cultures thanBuddhism.  <br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man (July 2000)	2000-07-03
US	50798783	R1FOMTS7C6GOM6	0898703743	59718948	Collected Works of G.K. Chesterton, Vol. 18	Books	4	21	21	N	N	Mostly about Chaucer and Stevenson.	The title is a little deceptive.  In fact, this book is mostly about Chaucer and his era, 220 pages worth.  Stevenson gets a fair shake at 106 pages.  But Carlyle gets only 12 pages, and Tolstoy only four, and those a  rather simplistic critique of his philosophy.  So only buy the book if  you're interested in the former two writers. <br />As in most of Chesterton's  biographies, the story of the subject's life is of minor interest here,  compared to a philosophical and artistic description of the subject's works  in the context of his time and &quot;modern times.&quot;  Chesterton is  interested in the writer as a thinker, as a creator, and as a moral agent.   In defending Stevenson and Chaucer, he argues for his view of Christianity,  poetry, love, and artistic humility.  If you want his religious views in a  purer form, go to the brilliant Orthodoxy or Everlasting Man. If you want a  detailed narration of the lives of the writers in question, look elsewhere.   And even for this style of biography, I think his book on Dickens was the  best I've read.  But I found his opinionated description and defense of  Chaucer and his times also very interesting.  And while he does not scatter  brilliant sayings like rose petals at a wedding, as in his best books,  (reading Everlasting Man, I wanted to copy every other sentence) a few  blossoms do flutter down, like the following, which also explain  Chesterton's method:<br />&quot;The truly impartial historian is not he who is  enthusiastic for neither side in a historical struggle. .  .The truly  impartial historian is he who is enthusiastic for both sides.  He holds in  his heart a hundred fanaticisms.&quot;<br />&quot;The greatest poets of the  world have a certain serenity, because they have not bothered to invent a  small philosophy, but have rather inherited a large philosophy.  It is,  nine times out of ten, a philosophy which very great men share with very  ordinary men.  It is therefore not a theory which attracts attention as a  theory.&quot;<br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man (July  2000)<br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-07-01

There are more things in heaven and in earth than dreamt of in Camus' philsophy; but it is a lucid dream, as far as it goes.  The story takes place in a drab town in North Africa.  There is something dreary also about  the narrator, who does not so much deny his heroism, as despise it.  (Like  an alter-ego of the narrator in Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground,  who despises his villainy.)  One does not notice flowers or taste food much  in Oran, and one gets the feeling that the buildings are gray.  One wonders  if Camus knows any other kind of town, or any other kind of life.  The book  is almost as dreary as 1984, and without the meadow where Orwell's lovers  found pleasure.  But perhaps that is part of what makes it a great mood  piece.<br />The novel's main weakness is philosophical.  It seems to me that  good philosophy, if not art, having assigned itself so sweeping a theme as  the meaning of suffering, will try to represent positions it attacks  truthfully.  Solzhenitsyn understands his Marxists, and  Dostoevsky his  atheists.  It seems to me this is one place Camus falls short.  I found  something bizarre in the attack Camus waged against what he seemed to think  was the Christian idea of suffering.  &quot;There are more things to admire  in men than to despise,&quot; he argued.  &quot;Everyone is more or less  sick of the plague.&quot;  &quot;Until my dying day I shall refuse to love  a scheme of things in which children are put to torture.&quot;  What is  bizarre is that Camus seems to think he is attacking Christianity here.  Actually, he is echoing some of the truths it has taught Western culture:  man made in the image of God, original sin that one might call a sickness,  the call of the prophets to rescue the downtrodden.<br />Camus' priest, who  says that the townspeople should not fight the disease, is at best one of  the straight men out of the book of Job, at worst a heretic.  The skeptical  doctor, on the other hand, is a figure of Christ in one dimension.  Like  Rieux, Christians have always &quot;fought against creation as we found  it,&quot; because we follow a man who risked his life to heal.  Like Rieux,  Jesus was not too heroic to show fear or doubt, and also came to a moment  of alienation from God.  In fact, some say the Gospel first caught on  largely because Christians were the only people in the Roman Empire willing  to nurse the sick during plagues.  By contrast, French existentialists come  late to the healing profession.<br />The question that never seems to occur  to anyone in this book, or in the reviews below, is, could the state of  having no illusions Camus recommends be the biggest self-delusion of all?  Considering my own life and those of people I know, the Gospels are more  realistic than the Plague, precisely because in them, tones of black and  gray fit into a larger pattern that includes more cheerful colors as well.  Miracles, the Ressurection, and the reality of a God who answers prayer,  are in my opinion truths that must be faced by any person who wants to  construct a complete picture of reality.  (Not to mention meadows with  flowers, children opening presents at Christmas, the sound of cicattas  after rain.)  Camus limits himself both by artistic design, and by  materialistic dogma, to show life from a certain, narrow angle, and does it  well.  But it would be a terrible mistake to impose that view on all of  reality, as Camus invites his readers to do.  Camus does not add to  orthodoxy, but subtracts from it -- and from life.<br />Camus discovered  death, and depicts it well.  If he had discovered life, he would have been  a more complete philosopher; but perhaps he wouldn't have won the Nobel  Prize for literature.  Read this excellent book, and let its truths sink  into your soul.  Then reach for Chesterton, Dickens, or Wu Cheng En -- or  even Solzhenitsyn, who went through worse hells than a plague and came out  more cheerful -- and see what Camus missed.  Better yet, read the Gospels,  and see more of it.<br />One minor complaint on the artistic side.  How is  it that Rieux's friends felt free to drop in on him at all hours during the  height of a plague?

This is a book that everyone ought to read two or three times at least.  It is a crime that such nonsense as Conversations With God, or better but still relatively shallow introductions to comparative religion like  Religions of Man, seem to be better known.  Here you will find a  description of Christianity and its relation to other faiths strong and  fine as aged wine.  I don't know of anyone who writes with this much class  in the modern world.  Having ordered the book for our college library, I  tried not to mark it too much, but found myself putting ink dots on  paragraph after paragraph of material I wanted to quote.  He rambles a bit,  but I think there is more wisdom, humor, and insight in a single page of  this book than in whole volumes that are better known in our days.  Imagine  if, after reading David Barry and laughing your head off, you wanted to go  out and kiss a blade of grass or be amazed by the water running in the  river instead of (say) looking up at the sky to make sure there aren't any  mackerel about to fall on you.  G.K.Chesterton makes his readers laugh  themselves sane.  And sanity is a rare and wonderful thing in the modern  world.  <br />Chesterton's archeology and contemporary references are a bit  dated, of course.  But even there, what goes around often comes around.   Chesterton leads off with a story about Grant Allen, author of a piece of  heresy of that time called &quot;Evolution of the Idea of God.&quot;  More  recently Karen Armstrong wrote a book with an almost identical title and  thesis, &quot;History of God,&quot; and was greeted in the press as a bold  thinker.  Chesterton kindly and elegantly refuted her error, and those of  many other modern skeptics, decades before they were born.  Admirers of  Bishop Spong in particular should read this book.  Chesterton was not a  scholar of comparative religions, of course, and he may have oversimplified  a few things, but I think got the big things in true proportion better than  anyone.<br />The plan of the book is simple.  In the first half, Chesterton  describes man, particularly in his religious aspect.  In particular, he  explains four universal elements of human religion: mythology, philosophy,  demonism, and an awareness of God that one finds in almost every culture  around the world. The tendency in the modern world is to ignore the last  two elements when they occur outside of Western culture.  But I have found  in my own studies of Asian cultures and religions that Chesterton's  description of human religion fit the facts extremely well.  <br />The second  half of the book is about Jesus and the movement he founded.  I like what  he says about Jesus best, and wish he had spent more time on that and  proportionally less on European culture.  A few of his racial or cultural  assumptions do not come across well in our age.  It is worth remembering  how the face of Christianity has changed over the hundred years since this  book was published.  Then Christianity was almost exclusively a Western  religion, while now two thirds of the believers in the world live in  Africa, Latin American and Asia.  <br />If you are interested in a more  detailed discussion of some of the points Chesterton brings up, I suggest  Don Richardson's Eternity in Their Hearts, another of the most overlooked  works of the 20th Century.  I have also just written a book called Jesus  and the Religions of Man, that covers in more detail (but undoubtedly with  less style) much of the same territory.       <br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-06-27

As a person who has long been interested in Asian minorities, I was looking forward to reading this book and learning about the Indian untouchables.  Unfortunately, the book is very short (about fifty pages, if  you don't count the prefaces and appendixes) and even so, the author keeps  saying the same thing over and over. He never does quite get around to  giving a very clear picture of the Dalits.  Nor do I feel certain that what  he does say is very reliable, since he has not defined his terms well or  otherwise shown himself capable of making an objectively satisfying  argument.  For example, he repeatedly claims that the Hindu Scriptures  justify racial oppression.  I keep waiting for him to quote them and prove  his point, but he never does.<br />The present edition also makes attempts  to relate the untouchables of India to the plight of African Americans.  American injustice is of course a worthwhile topic.  But as the author is  not an authority on it, and as it not the subject I wanted to learn about  when I ordered the book, I would rather the editors tell us more about the  Dalits before making parallels with other races.  Nor did I find the  author's attacks on Indian Marxists or Mahatma Gandhi persuasive or  relevent.<br />I have no fondness for Brahmidic Hinduism, and I don't doubt  that the untouchables of India have been and perhaps still are terribly  oppressed.  I wish the author well in his attempts to obtain justice for  his people.  I suggest he find a writer who can make the case for his  people more clearly and persuasively, however.

Tal Brooke has a lively style, and an imagination to match.  In fact, for the first few dozen pages, I was afraid I had purchased something like a tour  guide to India by a Christian Archie Bunker suffering the after-effects of  too many trips on LSD.  The book begins with Brooke's arrival in India, and  he doesn't have a kind word to say about anyone or anything that catches  his hyperactive glance.  But apparently these semi-psychodelic rages are  his way of describing jet lag and culture shock. When he arrives at Sai  Baba's compound, the book finds a more even keel as an imaginative and  insightful narrative of his experiences with Sai Baba and those around him.   He still may let his imagination get away from him at times, but it's a  very good read from then on.<br />As for the debate about Sai Baba, it doesn't  seem hard to me figure out.  A devote below claims that &quot;Readers who  have never seen Baba&quot; might be deceived by Brooke's slanders.  Well,  pictures and videos of Baba are abundant, in this book and elsewhere.   Compare the photo of the straight-talking missionaries on page 261 who  brought Brooke to Jesus, with one of Baba.  Pictures can be worth a  thousand words.  Tell me honestly: would you buy a used car from this man?   <br />The reviewer below who makes allowance for Brooke and  &quot;understands&quot; his diatribes against Baba and his lapse back into  &quot;fundamentalism,&quot; seems to me to be taking a more peculiar  position than the devotee who simply called him a liar.  If the bare facts  Tal Brooke relates in this book are true, no matter about his sometimes  bizarre speculations, then Sai Baba is a pervert who deceives and abuses  his followers.   <br />How does the picture Tal Brooke paints of Sai Baba  relate to mainstream Hinduism or Buddhism?  In some ways, Baba is a fair  representative of the esoteric occult tradition of these two religions.   Certainly it does not follow that all Hindu or Buddhist teachers are  abusive as he is.  I think Christians need to be careful about finding the  devil behind every bush -- much of this stuff may indeed be explained in  terms of general principles of psychology and trickery.  But of course, the  definition of the devil is &quot;the deceiver,&quot; so that only means he  may be carrying out his deception on various levels.  In my new book, Jesus  and the Religions of Man, relying on my own research of Buddhist sects and  other Asian religions, I argue that the relationship between magic and  miracles is very much what the Bible says it is; more complex that Brooke  describes, but certainly a dualistic contest between the holy and the  unholy, rather than a monistic merging of all faiths.  What Brooke says  about Sai Baba fits into the overall pattern pretty well, so I don't find  his suspicions misplaced.  I only suggest that Christian readers read the  book with caution, and make a clear separation between what Brooke observes  and what he supposes.  Of course for non-Christian readers, an open mind  and a heart that is searching for truth will also be helpful.           <br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-06-26
US	50798783	RF8D998OP6BMO	0060916575	372252081	Intellectuals:  From Marx and Tolstoy to Sartre and Chomsky	Books	2	18	27	N	N	As a philosopher, Johnson makes a good historian.	Paul Johnson is a lively writer who has chosen a an interesting group of people to portray.  As a Christian who votes mostly Republican, I am no big fan of most of these figures, except for Tolstoy and (to a lesser degree)  the author of Old Man and the Sea.  I am ready to agree that Rousseau,  Marx, and Sartre, and all,have by their words and lives helped make a mess  of the world.  (In fact, I have made the case about Marx myself more than  once.)  Furthermore, the book is entertaining.   Despite all that, I don't  much recommend it; perhaps because it is entertaining.<br />First of all, I am  not sure Johnson had enough sympathy for his subjects to really understand  them.  A few of the lives Johnson describes here are also discussed by the  psychologist Paul Vitz in his less-detailed but far better-argued study of  atheists, Faith of the Fatherless.  After reading Vitz, Bertrand Russell  seems a sad and rather lonely figure, who lost both parents as a small  child and spent his life looking for God in all the wrong places.  Johnson  portrayed him, more simply, as a devious and self-deluding hypocrit.  Maybe  so, but is the implicit invitation to contempt helpful or harmful?   Johnson's approach contrasts with the more orthodox approach of  G.K.Chesterton, who once responded to an essay contest on &quot;What is  wrong with the world?&quot; with the succcint reply, &quot;I  am.&quot;<br />Unlike Vitz, Johnson does not discuss any positive figures in  this book at any length.  After a few hundred pages of criticism, I wanted  to ask him, &quot;Whom do you admire?  Do you find anyone whom you disagee  with genuinely heroic?&quot;<br />Johnson claimed that Tolstoy's power as a  writer sprang from &quot;veneration of nature.&quot;  How can he miss, what  is obvious to everyone else (including conservatives), the moral insight  and incredible awareness of human nature Tolstoy displays?  Johnson even  tried to blame Tolstoy for the Bolshevik revolution.  Read Resurection and  the Communist Manifesto, and tell me that is not a cheap shot.       <br />Secondly, Johnson does not really give a coherent argument in this book,  as many reviewers note below.  What exactly is an intellectual?  What  relation does the term have with the word &quot;intellect?&quot;  Can we  really exclude prominent men and women of ideas like, say, C.S.Lewis,  George Orwell, or G.K.Chesterton, whom, for want of plausibility or desire,  Johnson failed to criticize?  Perhaps what he really meant by the word was  &quot;humanists,&quot; those children of the enlightenment who replace  God-centered faith with a religion of men, themselves in particular.  Jesus  said, &quot;By their fruits you will know them,&quot; so I don't think it  merely ad hominem to note when these prophets treat people like dirt.    Ideas have consequences, and I do agree that humanist ideas have most had  bad consequences.  But the argument to make this case should be more  focused and logically coherent than this one.  <br />Johnson gives us two  pieces of advice: beware of intellectuals, and people matter more than  ideas.  But he hasn't really told us what an intellectual is.  Is it those  to whom ideas matter more than people?  But it's not at all clear that many  of the worst offenders in this book really cared about ideas; in fact  Johnson often questions it himself.  And &quot;people matter more than  ideas&quot; is itself an idea.  For that matter, &quot;Love your neighbor  as yourself,&quot; and &quot;all men are created equal&quot; are ideas too,  that many men and women have thought worth more than their own lives.  It  seems to me that what Johnson should have said is, &quot;watch out for bad  intellectuals&quot; (or bad people in general) and &quot;don't listen to  bad ideas.&quot;  Truisms, of course, but he hasn't really built a case for  any more than that.  And the lives he details do show that neglect of the  obvious is one of the most harmful errors of our time. <br />Thirdly, as  interesting as other people's sexual vices might be, it does seem a tad  unfair of Johnson to complain about the dirt and wallow in it at the same  time.  In some places the book is almost pornographic.  If an author does  not approve of sexual obsessions, he should talk about them a bit less.   <br />Johnson is good at research, and an excellent writer; I learned a great  deal from Modern Times, and from this book as well.  But as far as  editorial on these sorry lives go, I think King David said about as much as  really needs saying:<br />&quot;Happy is the man who does not take the wicked  for his guide, nor walk the road that sinners tread, nor take his seat  among the scornful.  But the law of the Lord is his delight.&quot;   <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-06-26

Mel White was raised in a Christian home but found himself endowed, apparently through no fault of his own or those around him, with an interest in men rather than women.  The church told him his desires were wrong, and he needed to change.  But he found himself unable to change,and  came in the end to the conclusion that the church was wrong about  homosexuality.  Not only wrong, but bigoted, intolerant, hateful, and at  the root of a broad national intolerance that encourages thuggery against  gays.    <br />White told his story well, but left me wondering at what he  left out.  First of all, the premise of his argument seemed to be that  people are endowed with one of two distinct sexual orientations.  But there  are plenty of people who fall into some other camp.  If homosexuality is a  gift from God, what about those who only find pleasure by giving pain?  How  about people attracted to children?  They too could say, &quot;I was born  this way -- I have always had this desire -- God made me like this --  I  can't help myself.&quot; In fact, some of them do say these things.  With  these parallels in mind, White's repeated untested assumption that if one  cannot change one's orientation, it is therefore from God, seemed somewhat  hollow and anything but persuasive to me.  <br />In fact, White seems to have  forgotten the doctrine of the fall -- that not all in the world is as it  ought to be, even in our genes or instincts.  White tells us that  &quot;After decades of trying, we discovered that no one can change his  sexual orientation.&quot;  I am willing to grant that point, at least for  the sake of the argument.  But the Bible is not about orientation (which it  says in all cases is somewhat warped) but about action.  <br />White also  seemed to assume that &quot;straights&quot; are simply affirmed by  Christian morality.  But I didn't find White's account all that different  from my own life.  I also find the Bible confronting and restraining my  natural urges every day.  I married at 30.  Before and after that, I tried,  with some success and some failure (especially by Jesus' tough standards)  to stay within the constraints Scripture lays down. I am not sure it is  much easier now that I am married.  One partner gets sick, ages, loses  interest, husband and wife drift apart -- almost anyone who decides to live  as a Christian will face difficult challenges in regard to  sexuality.<br />Everyone around Mel White goes to great length to say how  honest he is.  To be frank, many of his modes of argument seem somewhat  devious to me.  He claims to bring up the name of Adolf Hitler with  reluctance when speaking of his old clients among the religious right, yet  he does so repeatedly.  He tends to paraphrase the so-called leaders of the  religious right (who cares what Jerry Falwell thinks, anyway?) when citing  such parallels, rather than using direct quotes.  Often the sting lies in  what he paraphrases, rather than the words he actually does quote.   &quot;Available studies show that those who attend church regularly. . .  tend to be more disapproving of (gay and lesbian people.)&quot;  (Did they  say people?  Or acts?)  He equivocates.  &quot;In far too many cases, those  young haters came from Christian homes.&quot;  (How many is too many?)  His  arguments are full of non-sequitors and hype.  (Did Hitler and Stalin  really quote the Bible when they &quot;created gulags and concentration  camps?&quot;  Having studied Marxism, I have yet to come across evidence of  Bible studies in the Kremlin.)  And why, having spent so much time looking  for evidence to prove that thugs who beat up on gays were inspired by the  religious right, did neither of the quotations he gave from the thugs  mention anything about religion?  <br />White shows the enthusiasm of the  convert, but also a great deal of the bitterness, and the quality of his  writing (or should I say &quot;their&quot; -- he shifts towards the  collective &quot;we&quot; of a spokesman or sectarian towards the end of  the book) suffers at times.  And yet, on his own account, all those  Christians truly close to him have loved him as best they could.  Who is he  bitter at?  And why did he mention so little of his children?  He speaks  with regret of the sexual pleasures he missed as a youth, and blames the  church.  Has it never occured to him that apart from those restrictions,  whatever we say for or against them, he might not be alive? Isn't that  worth something?  <br />As a story, I found Stranger facsinating, but as an  argument, it brought up more questions than it answered, and seemed more  than a little self-serving.   <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2000-06-23

While I wouldn't put it quite at the top of my list of Lewis' works, this guided stroll through Lewis' psyche on its dialectic course towards Christ is a pleasant and enlightening journey, full of off-beat humor and insight.  Starting from Puritanica (what modern readers might call Fundie-town) and the dread of a black pit with snakes and scorpions for those who do not obey &quot;The Landlord,&quot; the hero sets out in the other direction in search of an island paradise.  Along the way, he meets a diverse and amusingly described panoply of personalized tempters.  Some of these characters are a bit hard to finger, but many still survive as philosophical specimens.  Lewis has fun showing cultural Christians, Marxists, and bohemian artists in a Medieval landscape, alongside dragons and giants.  Reminiscent less of Bunyan than of Journey to the West at times, Lewis engages a self-depracatory and even slapstick humor to point to serious lessons.  But to me, the most poignant scene in the book was a more serious dialogue of riddles between Lady Reason and a Giant whose glance revealed the sub-human underpinnings of soul, revealing horrors in every person.  I understood that scene very well. The giant of reductionistic science still walks the land and holds many captive, and may have held me had Lady Reason not come to my rescue, too, with Lewis' help.<br />Reason defeated the monster with a few quick jabs, which go to the heart of the matter, but if you don't like allegory, Lewis develops his arguments more fully elsewhere. Those who would like to see the story of those years in prose, should read Surprised By Joy.  (Pilgrim's Regress is not meant to be entirely autobiographical, I don't think.)  For a didactic version of the confrontation with the giant, see Abolition of Man; if you want it in fairy-tale form, read Puddleglum's brilliant speech in The Silver Chair.  Lewis was nothing if not a versatile writer. <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-06-22

Some of the arguments below against Behe's thesis appear strong on some points; I'm not a biologist, and they don't give anything like the kind of detail Behe offers.  But even if Behe were wrong, I would give him four  stars.  First, for the apt metaphors, wit, and sardonic story telling by  which he makes his argument.  Second, for the excellent biology lesson he  gives along the way.  I think I would enjoy his classes, for he explains  the functions of the cell in an extraordinary way.  Far from &quot;wearing  the reader down,&quot; he illustrates biological systems in a step-by-step  manner that I think most intelligent readers will find fascinating.   (Though a few parts are difficult.)  Third, even if he's wrong,  evolutionary scientists can take his challenge as a homework assignment, a  list of &quot;some riddles that still need to solved.&quot; <br />If he's  right, five stars would be too stingy.  <br />Nor is it a serious argument to  complain, as a couple reviewers do below, that Behe talks about molecular  biology more than gross anatomy.  The former is his field, after all.     <br />Some seem upset that the scientifically illiterate masses might be led  away from the true faith by Behe. &quot;This people that knoweth not the  (natural) law -- a curse is on them!&quot;  <br />I feel a little more  detached from the argument, because my faith depends less on the  prehistoric record of the earth that on the fact that God does act in  history.  Human life itself, I think, is a kind of &quot;punctuated  equilibrium.&quot; It is clear to me that on occasion, God interfers in the  &quot;normal&quot; course of human events.  Whether or not He did so in the   past lives of animal species is, I think, a lesser question.  Behe argues  that that question is not as settled as many believe.  I think to prove him  wrong, a detailed and dispassionate refutation is in order.  And if the  counter-argument is successful, doesn't that make it all the more helpful  of Behe to have issued the challenge?  We'll all learn a great deal about  God's creation in the process.  So my advice is to read the book, and keep  an open mind.<br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man (July  2000)<br />d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-06-15

This is the kind of book that deserves five stars and one star at the same time, so you compromise and give it something in between.  The authors have a good idea, to show the difference the Gospel has had on human society.   And they've done a good amount of homework, at least from the point of view  they want to propound.  And I agree that the Gospel has influenced the  world for the better more than anything else.  But they flog their point to  death.  They overgeneralize and show a lack of generosity and understanding  towards other cultures and religions.  <br />The authors appear to be of the  &quot;total depravity&quot; school of thought.  They seem to feel that the  best way to argue for Christianity is to persuade us that no good thing  exists in the darkness outside.  They do not find it difficult to maintain  this position, because, frankly, they don't really seem to know much about  other cultures.  They argue that: without the Bible there &quot;would  likely be no hospitals.&quot;  (Have they never heard of the Buddhist  emperor Ashoka, who built hospitals across India hundreds of years before  Christ?)  There would be no universities.  (Have they never heard of the  great monastic schools of Tibet, or the academies of ancient Greece and  China?)  There would be no capitalism!  (Was it Jesus' face on that coin,  after all?) Millions would die of v.d. &quot;without any inhibition against  sexual promiscuity.&quot;  (Do the people in India, China, the Muslim  world, really show fewer inhibitions than in the West?) The Bible is the  source of great literature!  (Have the authors ever read the Journey to the  West?  Wondered over a Song landscape or been touched by a Tang poem about  the moon and one's loved one?)<br />Is it really fair to represent the Chinese  culture with a story about human beings being body lice on the god's skin?   The authors have apparently never read the ancient Chinese philosopher Mo  Zi, who wrote, hundreds of years before St. John, that God is love,and that  we should pattern our character after the universal love of God.  They  apparently don't know that the Chinese said God is the &quot;parent&quot;  of humankind.  <br />The Bible led to the invention of basketball!  The Bible  added new phrases to the English language!  All right, already!       <br />There is a lot of useful information in this book. The overall tone of  the book would be vastly improved though if the authors (1) Learned to  appreciate the good in other civilizations and belief systems.  (As  Augustine did in City of God and C.S.Lewis did in everything he wrote --  the authors praise these men so highly -- well read them and learn from  them!  And study Paul's tactful approach in Acts 17!) (2) Learned the  difference between a good argument and a bad argument, and got rid of the  bad arguments that choke this book.  (3) Try harder to be fair to people of  other religions.  (4) Read the works of non-Christians and quoted them more  often.  That makes any argument stronger.  (5) Take a closer look at evils  committed in the European &quot;age of faith&quot; such as the inquisition,  witchhunts and pogroms.  They did this briefly in the companion volume, but  if they developed such subjects more fully it would give the books more  balance, and give us a less triumphalistic and more challenging work that  would perhaps also be a more persuasive argument for the Gospel.   <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man (July 4, 2000)   d.marshall@sun.ac.jp	2000-06-13

WhileI don't remember the details of the earlier books, I do remember thefeeling I had entering her world. And the blend of moral insight, magical powers and occult dangers seems like a familiar and slightly disquieting scent.<br />Le Grin undoubtedly is a skilled myth-maker.  Her protagonist is a young man who is learning to use his magical powers. Her world is sparsely but I think rather well realized.  (Her maps are more real-looking than Tolkien's.)  The outline of the book is rather similar to the great Chinese classic Journey to the West: a hero of great power overreaches himself and is forced to set out on a journey to learn (among other things) humility and self-control.  Along the way Le Grin drops the reader thoughts to chew on for a while. &quot;Magic consists in this: the true naming of a thing.&quot; (How does that apply to modern genetics?)  &quot;The price of the game is the peril of losing one's self.&quot; (True whether the game is business, the occult, or modern science.)<br />The ease with which Le Grin's hero, Ged, works magic, I think, threatens the plot and the imaginable quality of her world sometimes.  Ged flits from island to island so easily that the world becomes rather too dream-like. He is in danger of becoming too strong to have adventures.  The story is about his taming to good, like the Monkey King. Yet one gets the feeling that in Le Grin's world, evil is ultimately stronger.  Perhaps this is why her world feels less real, and less enjoyable, to me than those of Tolkien or Lewis, based on a Christian psychology, or that of Journey to the West, based on a rather cheerful Buddhism.  Nor do I think her insight or imagination can really be compared with Tolkien in Lord of the Rings or Lewis in Till We Have Faces. And her world seems to have less humor than the other three.  While I enjoyed the creative realization of her story, and felt as if she were bringing me near to some depths of psychological insight, I felt a little dizzy from the journey, and was glad to be back on terra firma.  But I'll probably take another short visit before long.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man...	2000-06-12

I suppose there are two kinds of people who read these reviews: those ten or fifteen people who have never read Lord of the Rings, and want to know whether they should or not, and people who have visited this land many  times and, feeling nostalgia, want to hear other reports of it.  All I can  say to the first group is, if you like to stay at home, safe behind VCR and  keyboard, never read a book twice, and want managable cliches to do the  work of imagining for you when you do read a story, give this one a wide  berth.  If, on the other hand, you feel that this world is not quite your  home, beware of Middle Earth, it may enchant you.  It may not be heaven,  but for those who can feel its incantation, it may awaken a longing that  nothing on earth can quite satisfy.<br />Maybe that sounds overblown to you.  Let me just tell you, then, it's a great story, and for some, it will be  hard to find a better.  Tolkien has taken the raw material of the human  psyche and fashioned a world with it, and then put a story in that world  that will fill your imagination with unforgetable images.  I don't think I  even noticed, the first several times through, the genius he displays for  character and motivation or for linguistic invention, the story swept me  off my feet so completely.  After years of reading it, even the things I  don't much care for -- some of the poetry, Sam's overly servile attitude, a  bit of a slow beginning in Fellowship of the Ring, some rather clumsy  map-making -- have worked into the whole and become a part of its charm.  Best not pick this book up for the first time without a very long block of  free time ahead of you, in case it strikes you in the same way.	2000-05-21

Elliot Miller does a good job of giving an overview of the New Age movement.  While the book needs up-dating, I certainly found it a helpful and sane introduction to the movement from an American point of view.  (I  tend to approach New Age thinking more from the point of view of Asian  religions, so many of the names he brought up were new to me.)  He is  fairly objective, and does well to give all sides of the matter, but does  not leave any doubt where his loyalties lie.  (Jesus -- the Gospel  version.)  He finds things to praise in the New Age movement, as well as  things to criticize in some Christian critiques of it.  (A discussion of  Constance Cumbey's simplistic attacks on the movement fills a chapter, but  there too he is balanced enough to point out the good as well as the bad  that her attacks accomplished.)  Miller describes the movement, its  influence on politics and science, and channeling and other forms of the  occult within that movement, without settling for &quot;one size fits  all&quot; answers.  (i.e., &quot;The devil is taking over over the  world,&quot; as if he didn't have it already.)  Miller shows a breadth of  thinking wide enough to engage New Agers on a variety of topics, though I  don't see all of his arguments as equally valid.  The appendix in which he  tells his own story may be the most interesting part of the book.   <br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man (July 2000)	2000-05-11

I found Faith of the Fatherless readable, sympathetic, and suggestive if not absolutely persuasive.  The book is admittedly anecdotal; it would be beyond the ability of one man to run his survey to &quot;a group made up of millions,&quot; as the critic below suggests.  But it seems to me Vitz gives a good sample of the most famous theists and anti-theists of the past two centuries, and I felt summarized their stories in an interesting and empathetic manner.  I did not find his tone ad hominem, certainly not like Paul Johnson's Intellectuals.  While I think a more whollistic undertanding of the development of spirituality would discuss moral and rational reasons for atheism or theism, as well as irrational causes such as the character of one's father, Vitz is a psychologist, after all, not primarily a philosopher.  While the model he gives here may be a bit simplistic, he does not dismiss these other factors out-of-hand, as do determinists.  <br />Aside from other questionable statements, Eric Rogers' criticism below directly misrepresented Vitz on at least four points.  Vitz did not make the remark imputed to him in the first paragraph; Roger has telescoped a long quotation to make him say what he did not say.  Vitz did not &quot;assume Voltaire hated his father simply because he changed his name;&quot; he gave strong corroborative evidence for that hatred.  Nor did he &quot;assume&quot; H.G.Wells rejected his father; he quoted him directly on the subject in an exceedingly persuasive passage.  Nor, finally and most importantly, did Vitz claim that his theory determined a child's view of God.  He stated directly and repeatedly that lack of a strong father figure is only a strong influencing factor.  So the fact that siblings may choose different beliefs is no argument against Vitz' theory.  I find it ironic that Rogers should accuse Vitz, and Christians in general by implication, of determinism, ad hominem, and illogic, when Vitz specifically rejects the shoddy deterministic logic that atheists (especially Marxists and Freudians) have used against Christianity for hundreds of years.  The vehemence and inaccuracy of Roger's attack almost begs a psychological explanation itself.  <br />Faith of the Fathers should not be mistaken for an apologetic for the Christian faith, however.  An atheist could even argue that the conclusion children come to who have lost their fathers is a valid inference from personal experience to the true nature of a cruel universe.  The book adds to my sense of responsibility as I raise children of the same vulnerable age, and my concern as I see parents abandoning their responsibiities so easily in modern society.<br />How might Vitz's argument apply to non-Western cultures?  As I argue in Jesus and the Religions of Man (due June 2000), the concept of the Creator is both universal and surprisingly consistent around the world, even in &quot;Hindu,&quot; &quot;Buddhist&quot; and tribal cultures.  I find tentative corroboration of Vitz's argument in the ways Confucian thought has, for 3000 years, related duty to Heaven, as &quot;Parent&quot; of mankind, to duty to one's parents.  The early life of Mao Zedong also strongly confirms the link in a negative way. I think many readers are likely to find possible confirmation of Vitz' theory among their own circle must not forget or oversimplify the pain and the complex causes that lie behind individual cases.&quot; Nor, of course, should we assume that the Fulfills the Chinese Culture (d.marshall@sun.ac.jp) END	2000-03-19

The strongest objection to Christianity among Chinese and  Japanese has always been &quot;Christianity is a foreign religion.&quot;   Even if the authors are only letting their imaginations run wild, it seems  to me they are running in a productive direction.  But I think most readers  will feel the evidence shows there is something more to their argument than  that.<br />While I reccommend this book to anyone interested in Chinese  culture, I have three criticisms.  First, the human mind has an amazing  ability to find patterns.  If the authors were to take a slightly more  critical approach to their own ability to imagine, I would feel more free  to recommend this book to critical thinkers.  Second, some of the  characters they analyze are a stretch. Some skeptical readers might be put  off by the bad arguments and overlook the good ones.  <br />My main objection,  though, is to the author's historical framework.  I doubt the Chinese were  consciously trying to encode the Genesis record in their language.  This  for four reasons.  First, I don't think you can link the Chinese and the  Jews that closely historically or genetically.  Second, redemptive  analogies can be found in many culures.  (Polynesian, Japanese, and  American, African, and New Guinea tribes.)  They are not always related to  Genesis.  Third, many Chinese characters, like the words for  &quot;come&quot; and the old word for &quot;world,&quot; show meanings  related not to Genesis but to the death of Jesus on the cross.  And nobody  thinks the ancient Chinese had a copy of the New Testament. And fourth,  when Paul went to Athens and preached the &quot;unknown God,&quot; he  didn't need to link him historically to Jehovah to show his audience that  the God he spoke of was not a &quot;foreign God.&quot;  Neither do we.  I  think the book should be read and passed on, but with caution. But I've  heard the authors themselves have been more cautious in recent editions.        <br />I strongly disagree with the reader below who called this book  &quot;a bunch of crock&quot; and said the God the ancient Chinese worshiped  was not the Christian God.  In fact, the concept of God in ancient China  (the books of Poetry and History, for examples) described a God who was  &quot;parent&quot; of mankind, wholly good, loves mankind, rewards the good  and punishes evil, is far above all other gods, and has never been  worshiped with an idol.  Even non-Christians, like Chen Jingpan, admit,  &quot;From the very ancient days of Chinese history, down through the time  of Confucius to the present, we have records about the Chinese belief in  one supreme God, the ruler over heaven and earth.&quot;  <br />I've recently  been editing final drafts of a book, due in July, called Jesus and the  Religions of Man.  It includes a chapter called &quot;The Non-History of  God,&quot; showing the universal and changeless character of the concept of  Creator.  I'd be happy to e-mail a copy of that chapter to Jing Wang if he  contacts me.  <br />Author, True Son of Heaven: How Jesus Fulfills the Chinese  Culture  (d.marshall@sun.ac.jp)	2000-02-24

For a man who was only in China a year and doesn't speak Chinese, Helms saw a lot, and understood a surprising amount of what he saw.  His writing is top-notch, and he comes across as a warm and congenial human being.   (Granted, as Atila the Hun might, if he could write.) This poetic series of  essays is a nostalgic delight to those of us who get homesick for a China  that was never quite our home, and an excellent flow-of-conscious  introduction for those who plan to go and want to avoid being shocked or  disoriented, or at least be aware it's not just jet-lag when you are a bit  shocked and disoriented.<br />I give the book five stars on the basis of its  genre.  Helm's ecclectic travelogue should not, of course, be mistaken for  an in-depth attempt to understand the subjects he treats.  As a missionary,  I naturally also don't agree with his jibes against Christian evangelists,  and find it ironic that he tells us to &quot;eschew evangelism&quot; in one  essay, while in another admits to evangelizing himself, on behalf of his  concept of democracy.  Also he is a bit simplistic to complain that Chinese  walls are &quot;inhuman&quot; and human beings ought to &quot;tear them  down.&quot;  In fact walls are intensely human, the world being what it is,  as is Helm's irritation at them.  For those who would like to better  understand the psychology behind some of the walls China builds against the  outside world, after you finish this wonderful book, for desert I recommend  Wild Swans.

Chasing the Dragon is well-written and fast-paced, and offers a little of everything: cops, robbers, farce, trajedy, an argument or two, and most of all, lives changed by the Gospel.  Jackie has led a remarkable life, but  wears her experience lightly, with a sense of humor. Having lived in Hong  Kong, visited her church and known people who worked with her or become  Christians through her ministry, the book was especially interesting to me.  <br />I once traveled around Asia to do research on forced prostitution and  AIDs. I hope others will follow her example, in the leading of the Holy  Spirit, because there is a great need.  In my opinion, this kind of  ministry may be one of the key cross-cultural evangelistic outreaches of  our time, and this book would be valuable to anyone trying to understand  either the past or the future of missions.  Many of the most successful  Asian evangelists I have met were once drug addicts or criminals.  This  book might also be a good book to give to a non-Christian friend or to a  Christian police officer who has become cynical and forgotten how God can  change lives.<br />One caution: I think readers should beware of a  &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; attempts to emulate the exact ways in which  God's spirit works in other peoples' ministries.

Jackie has led a remarkable life, and  her sense of humor is evidence that her success hasn't gone to her head.   I've met her twice.

God has delighted in using the weak things of this world to  confound the strong, as Paul put it.  And the need is great, especially  with the spread of AIDs.  Christians going to the mission field might pray  about ministry to drug addicts and prostitutes.

A moving biography of the most successful individual missionary to China, Jonathan Goforth.  They could make a movie out of the Goforth's amazing and hair-raising escape from the Boxers alone.  The couple saw much, suffered  much, and accomplished much, with the help of God.  I put the book down  feeling a bit guilty, but greatly inspired.<br />Goforth's story is also  important for what it says about the relationship between repentance in the  church and success on the mission field.  Why has the church in China grown  so spectacularly in the past few decades?  Goforth of China represents a  missing link between the Great Awakenings in America and the spread of the  Gospel in Korea and China.  In my opinion, revival beginning with  repentance in the church has been one of the four or five keys to the  success of Christian missions around the world, and potential missionaries  could no better than to study this book for that reason.  (Others are  redemptive analogies -- read Eternity in Their Hearts for That -- what I  call &quot;Rescue Evangelism&quot; -- Chasing the Dragon -- and medicine  and education -- take your pick.)<br />The tale is told by Jonathan's wife,  Rosalin, and their affectionate and mutually-respectful partnership over  decades of working together in China makes the book something of an  understated love-story as well.  <br />Author, True Son of Heaven: How Jesus  Fulfills the Chinese Culture  (d.marshall@sun.ac.jp)	2000-02-09

I find myself agreeing with  the points both those who liked the book and those who didn't like it made.  The man makes many good ideas.  His discussion of how the Gospel transformed the role of women is itself worth  the price of the book, and his insights about the courage believers showed  during epidemics and martyrdom is also helpful.  But, at the same time, the  hubris of social science, a reliance on theories which are most persuasive  within the narrow, modern framework in which most of Stark's direct  research appears to have been conducted, often brings him to overreach  himself badly.    <br />He argues, for example, that new religious movements  are alway &quot;based on the more privileged classes.&quot;  He also argues  we do not &quot;need&quot; miracles or mass conversions to explain the  growth of the church.  Finding a growth rate over three centuries close to  the 43% that Mormonism  has maintained for the last century, he is  encouraged  to think he has discovered a scientific principle,  which  negates the need for &quot;exceptional explanations.&quot;<br />But the fact  that an explanation for a given event credible to one's apriori theories of  life can be found, or imagined, in no way renders incredible reports which  assert (with great force of eyewitness evidence) that in fact something  else happened!  Those who do not with to believe in miracles may find  comfort in Stark's theories.  But they should not be confused for a serious  argument against the events related in the Gospels and the Book of Acts.    <br />I just returned from a small town in China which, before the revolution,  had about 20 Christians, but now has over a thousand.  This is a 110%  growth rate per decade, without the advantages of higher birth and survival  rates of the Roman Christians, or of birth rates and obligatory 2-year  preaching apprenticeships of the Mormons.  In fact, for most of that time,  preaching was extremely dangerous, and martyrs were seldom allowedto be  treated as public heros as Stark described them.  Yet this growth rate has  been typical in many parts of China.  In Anhui province, the church has  grown about a hundred times (not percent) in just two decades!  However  they may confuse sociological theory, in practice miracles, mass  conversions, and the supernatural preparation of Chinese culture for the  Gospel (as Paul and Augustine found in Greco-Roman culture) seem to playing  a tremendous role in these events. I have met people involved in mass  conversions and miracles myself.  Furthermore, while intellectuals are also  converting, peasants are probably the strongest conduit for Christian faith  in China today.  And China is not alone in this respect.<br />When I first  took a social science course at the University of Washington where Stark  teaches 20 years ago, my immediate reaction was, &quot;What this man is  teaching, when translated into ordinary English, seems to reduce to either  to common sense or to nonsense.&quot;  Give Stark credit.  His ideas do not  need translating, his style is lively and his thoughts clear.  Better yet,  his &quot;discoveries&quot; lean strongly towards the first category as  opposed to the second.  But most of them are not really surprising, on  careful reading  of the Bible.  And some are simply mistaken.

Lewis Classics)	Books	5	14	16	N	N	Bio-engineers, read this book!	A timely and prophetic defense of the authority of moral absolutes.  (Prophetic not in the sense of foreseeing the future -- though a little of that too -- but of boldly speaking unpopular truths to a culture that  sorely needs to hear them.)  Just a few months ago Francis Fukuyama  actually used the phrase &quot;abolition of man&quot; in a positive way to  describe the effect of upcoming advances in genetic engineering and  computer technology on the human race.  God save us from ourselves.<br />The  Puget Sound reader who, in an otherwise cogent critique, complained that  Lewis' use of the word &quot;Tao&quot; to describe traditional morality is  &quot;presumptuous,&quot; couldn't be more wrong.  The word's original  non-metaphorical meaning (road or path) was first expanded by Confucius  (not Lao Zi), who used it in precisely that sense.  (&quot;Our Master's Tao  is simply this: conscientiousness and consideration.&quot;) In Lao Zi,  though some passages can be interpretted as antinomian (if you favor letter  over spirit), I think that as with Jesus, it was not goodness Lao Zi meant  to rebuke, but people who think they can legislate it.  Indeed, the history  of Taoism nicely illustrates Lewis' thesis about the universality of the  moral code.  By the end of the second century, mainstream Daoism was  interpreting Lao Zi's attack on moral rules to mean you need to follow the  right rules.  By the Fifth Century lists of sins appear that could have  been written by a Southern Baptist preacher with Sierra Club leanings:  &quot;The sin to throw food or drink into fresh water. . . to eat by  yourself when among a group. . . to abort children or harm the unborn . .  to be nasty to beggars. . . to worship ghosts and spirits.&quot; (!)  Yes,  there are differences, as Lewis admitted, yet the similiarities are not  &quot;superficial,&quot; but show morality is universal truth rather than  an arbitrary convention.<br />How great is the danger Lewis writes of?  I am  not sure.  But certainly this remains a  timely warning against relativism,  a reductionist approach to man and to nature, and all the sordid  machinations of realpoliticians and social engineers around the world.  My  only serious complaint is the book too  short. ....sure.

The mark of a good teacher is the degree to which his students learn even when, or especially when, he goes off on a tangent.  By that measure, Lewis ranked among the best, and the Medieval cornocopia of miscellaneous ideas  that is this book is an education.  You learn philosophy, English and Irish  topography, education, jokes, a theory of language study, a theory of  C.S.Lewis, and most of all, everything you did or did not want to know  about literature.  Actually, some of what he says on that subject assumes  more knowledge than most of us are likely to possess.<br />Yes, there is also  a story here also, about how Lewis searched for Joy and found Jesus  instead. (The title is a pun, by the way, worth five stars all by itself.)  And the  interuptions and detours tend to enhance the reader's appetite for  the story, rather than detract from it.  <br />I don't agree with the reader  below, or with the criticism in A.N.Wilson's biography which it parallels.   Reason clearly played a central role in his conversion.   In this book,  however, he describes the effect of the reasoning on him, rather than  recounting the particular arguments in detail as he has done in other  books.  He said the book was going to be subjective, even apologized for  the fact in the preface!  To speak subjectively is not to belittle the  objective facts which act on the subject; to make that equation shows a  fundamental misunderstanding of Lewis' thought and of thought in general.   For example, Lewis describes here how the &quot;most hard-boiled atheist I  ever met&quot; came into his room one day and admitted that the evidence  for the Gospels was &quot;surprisingly good.&quot;  Lewis describes his  shock, and the effect this idea had on him.  But if you want a fuller  version of Lewis' reasoning on that subject, written just a little bit  later than this book, see his brilliant and devastating little essay,  Elephants and Fernseed -- which to my mind drove a stake through the heart  of all Higher Criticism, including that written decades after his death,  such as Wilson's silly biography of Jesus.  Lewis also speaks of the effect  the arguments of his Christian friends and the books he read had in  converting him to Christianity, but again don't expect him to give you  those arguments here.  <br />My one criticism is Lewis ought not to have  subjected his father to his satirical and rather cutting brand of humor as  he does in a few passages.  <br />Author, True Son of Heaven: How Jesus  Fulfills the Chinese Culture	1999-12-21

There is nothing &quot;uncommon&quot; about the dialogue in this book.   Over the past several years I've read and heard the channeled revelations  and apocryphal Gospels of a good number of religious innovators like Mr.  Walsch.  His teachings show the typical limits of such literature.  Unlike,  say, Joseph Smith, who preached about Pilgrims on the moon, Walsch was  smart enough to avoid dishing out many hard facts, but some of the few he  did give, he got wrong.  And the philosophy he tried to build around them  is a watered-down version of all the most harmful religious theories of the  last several thousand years.<br />What Walsch appears to be trying to write is  a Socratic primer for people raised in the Christian faith who would like  to convert to Eastern thought but find the Bible getting in their way.   Apparently he thinks if he inserts enough, &quot;Thus saith the Lord&quot;  at the head of enough 90s New Age cliches, his readers will fall on their  faces before their bedroom mirrors and confess, &quot;I am God.&quot;  But  even when he lobs his &quot;God&quot; softball question after softball  question, his smart-aleck &quot;God&quot; seldom hits the ball out of the  infield of mushy monistic psychobabble.  We are all gods.  Suffering and  evil are in our minds.  There is no such thing as wrong.  You are the most  marvellous thing in creation; it was your parents who dragged you down.   Listen to your feelings; you are the authority for all truth. Hell is  ignorance.  The church is lying.  Sex is wonderful; go out and have as much  of it as you like.<br />&quot;Conversations with God&quot; is Hinduism on the  cheap (reincarnation, but no karmic debt, moral binds, or caste  obligations), or Zen Buddhism for weekend mystics. It's nothing we haven't  heard from every New Age guru and pop psychologist in the last three  decades, from Jim Jones to Bagwan Rajneesh and Shirley MacClaine.  We even  someone else is to blame, Christianity is the opiate of the people, etc. .  .<br />Walsch's God is clueless about the true history of both Western and  Asian religions, has no mature and balanced philosophy of rules and  freedom, and appears to have gotten most his ideas about the Bible from  Humanist Society comic books. His version of how the Gospels took shape,  that the New Testament writers &quot;never saw Jesus in their lives&quot;  but wrote stories &quot;passed down from elder to elder&quot; proves the  man knows nothing about the early church.  Even modern critics, though they  seldom put it in so many words, admit that the Gospels must have taken form  within the lifespan of Jesus' original followers.<br />Who was Walsch really  channeling?  The whole routine has come to sound familiar. &quot;God never  said anything nasty about death.  Just do what you like!  Take a bite! You  will not die, but will be as gods, and know good and evil.&quot;  Sometimes  I wonder if the devil is really so unimginative Then again, these lines  Chinese Culture	1999-10-29

Books	3	33	51	N	N	Yancey told one side of the story well	Well-written as are all of Yancey's books, full of passion and good ideas, What's so Amazing About Grace is also seriously out of balance, in my opinion.  The uncritical adulation heaped upon the book by the Christian  community, and Yancey's willingness to accept that adulation (see his own  comments above, and also the reviews on the cover of the book) reveals, it  seems to me, a corresponding lack of balance in contemporary Christian  thinking which accounts for a lot.<br />I found four serious problems with the  book.  First, it seemed to me the word &quot;Ungrace&quot; was left  ill-defined.  When a father spanks his son, is that ungrace?  When a judge  sentences a thief to prison, is that ungrace?  When a soldier fires on an  enemy in combat, is that ungrace?  The examples and tone of Yancey's book  lead the reader naturally to include all cases of retribution and  punishment in this category.  At the least, he set the ball rolling in that  direction and erected no clear barrier to it.  And yet in each of these  cases the person involved may be doing his duty as a Christian, may even be  exercising courage, wisdom, and yes, love that border on the heroic, in an  attempt to obey God.  Should actions which arise out of a desire to  &quot;Love God and love others&quot; be lumped with mass-murder and child  molestation in a single category?  &quot;Ungrace&quot; seems to embrace all  actions not arising specifically out of an urge towards forgiveness and  unmerited kindness.  It abstracts a single virtue out of the matrix of the  complete Christian life and makes it absolute, which, as C.S.Lewis pointed  out, is a dangerous thing to to.<br />Second, while Yancey discussed the cost  of grace to the agent of grace, he did not discuss or adequately consider  the often much greater cost to the recipient or to innocent bystanders.   Many point in the book, the question almost brought itself up, but without  eliciting the attention from the author that it deserved.  Forexample,  Yancey mentioned the murder rate in Japan, which is a tiny fraction of that  in the U.S., and ascribed it (in part) to society's ungrateous treatment of  criminals.  The obvious question, which he did not raise, might be stated  thus: is the personal cruelty the families expressed towards those  criminals too high a price for the tens of thousands of lives that the  system saves every year?  Or to put it another way, should we sacrifice the  lives of ten potential innocent victims, not to mention the freedom of  everyone to go out at night (I live in Japan) so that one actual criminal  might be shown mercy?  If Christians think the example of Jesus on the  cross provides an easy answer to that question in the affirmative, it seems  to me position at least replies a more rigorous and systematic argument.   Again, Yancey noted that since divorce has been tolerated in the United  States, the divorce rate has risen to one half.  SO then are all the  children who miss out on a father or mother an acceptable sacrifice to what  he calls grace?  <br />The example Yancey began his book with was the most  extreme, and made my blood boil.  Having myself worked in places where  girls were sold into prostitution for the sake of their parents addictions,  my reaction may have been somewhat different from that of most readers.  If  it were up to me, I would send that woman to the prison for life, or the  electric chair, in an instant, if  it would save her little girl from the  abuse she was subject to.  At the very least, I insist that the good of the  victim should be considered before that of the person who is preying upon  her, and I think the Bible says so too.  Yancey, on the other hand, didn't  seem to even think of the little girl, except as part of the shame her  mother experienced.  The woman complained that church would &quot;only make  me feel worse,&quot; he reported  What, should the thought of proximity to  the Christian God make a person who is selling her daughter into  prostitution feel better?<br />Third, the Bible does talk about judgement as  well as grace, and not just the first half.  Can Yancey ignore those  passages and still call his view Christian?  As Yancey wrote with Dr. Paul  Brand in their book on Pain, there is no substitute for physical pain for  reminding us to take care of our bodies.  Does not the threat of judgement  (ungrace) play the same role in encouraging us to see to our spiritual  health?  And what are we to do with the words of the prophets?  Has human  psychology and the character of God really changed so radically that we can  now interpret the rest of the New Testament exclusively in the light of a  few chapters in Romans?<br />It seems to me that many examples of  &quot;ungrace&quot; Yancey gave involved blue-collar workers or other  simple Christians who lack his education or subtlety of expression.  They  may lack wisdom, I agree, but I know some Christians like that who on paper  would sound equally &quot;ungracious,&quot; but in practice show true  Christian love.  I think it possible some of them were just trying to stand  up for God in the only way they knew how.<br />Finally, Yancey wrote that  &quot;some studies&quot; show that Christians are equally likely to rent  x-rated movies, divorce, and have abortions, his point being that  legalistic preaching on sex hasn't worked.  Yancey didn't argue that the  studies were accurate, and they sound suspicious to me, because I know that  the warnings of the Bible have an effect on some people, anyway.  But if in  fact Christian preaching against evil has no impact on anyone, why do we  bother with it at all?  Why does Yancey think anyone will really listen to  him, either?  <br />In any case, his conclusion here, that fundamentalist  rules have if anything an opposite effect to their design, conflicts with  his other examples, which show that Japanese legalism, for one, succeeds  very well, resulting in dramatically reduced crime.<br />Having grown up like  Yancey in a strict Christian church, it seemed to me the church is not too  strict about sex, but far and away too lax.  Even good pastors seem afraid  to bring the subject up, or maybe they don't realize how important it is to  young people.  Having listened to sermons in hundreds of churches and youth  groups, I can only vaguely recall hearing someone venture to guide  Christians on this subject a few times.  In this case, as Chesterton put it  about Christianity in general, Christian morality has not been tried and  found wanted, it has been found difficult and not tried at all -- at least  not recently.<br />We are all in need of God's grace, myself no less than  anyone.  And praise God for the wonderful examples of grace Yancey gave.   But surely we can find a way to integrate the laws of God and the love of  God in a more wholistic, and truly loving way?  Yancey is a fabulous  writer, but in my opinion he does not show a very complete grasp of the  Biblical approach or the real-life complexities of this problem.	1999-07-13
