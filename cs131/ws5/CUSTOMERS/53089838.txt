His interview \\"On Screenwriting\\" describes both the benefits and the frustrations associated with that choice. His advice is just as relevant to the would-be screenwriter today as it was when he wrote it.<br /><br />His \\"Proposed Scene for Kubrick's Rhapsody,\\" and \\"Plums and Prunes,\\" provide interesting examples of proposed movie scenes that will prove interesting to readers unfamiliar with that arcane art.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, \\"Grooving in Chi\\" is an excellent description of the Chicago riots during the Democratic National Convention in 1968.<br /><br />Finally, pieces like \\"The Beautiful-Ugly Art of Lotte Lenya,\\" \\"When Film Gets Good,\\" \\"Rolling Over Our Nerve-Endings [William Burroughs],\\" and \\"Writers at Work [Henry Green]\\" prove that he could write serious criticism.<br /><br />Through it all flows that wonderful, irreverent, sense of humor.<br /><br />Good stuff.	2005-10-10

What is missing is any kind of objective analysis, fawning praise taking its place. Terry was a good guy, but that doesn't mean he was a great writer.<br /><br />As Hill points out, it is difficult to assess Southern as a writer because so many of his collaborators claim credit for much of what he did (e.g., Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda on \\"Easy Rider\\"). Thus, his reputation has to rise or fall based upon a few major works -- \\"Flash and Filigree,\\" \\"Candy\\" (coauthored with Mason Hoffenberg, a junky), \\"The Magic Christian,\\" \\"Red Dirt Marijuana,\\" and the screenplay for \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" (for which Stanley Kubrick also claimed credit). Lee Hill concludes that \\"The Magic Christian\\" is the best of these. I generally agree, although there is a story in \\"Red Dirt Marijuana,\\" titled \\"Razor Fight,\\" that is on a par with anything Hemingway wrote.<br /><br />Terry's son, Nile, has published a collection of his shorter works, \\"Now Dig This: The unspeakable writings of Terry Southern\\" that provides additional indications of greatness and is well worth purchasing.	2005-10-10

Instead of a cohesive plot, \\"Howards End\\" consists of a series of aphorisms loosely strung together by a rambling plot. The characters themselves are not particularly interesting, and the issues that Forster chose to focus on (Socialism v. Capitalism, Women's Suffrage, etc.) are dated and of little interest today.<br /><br />The aphorisms themselves are interesting and perceptive, but reading them has a jarring effect on one's enjoyment of the novel, since they literally appear on every page, often several times.<br /><br />A far better novel is \\"A Passage to India,\\" which deals with timeless themes (although within a contemporary context), and offers a more structured plot and more interesting characters. This seems to be the generally accepted view, although the Vintage paperback edition of \\"Howards End\\" does quote Lionel Trilling (the leading expert on Forster) as being of the opinion that \\"'Howard's End' is undoubtedly Forster's masterpiece.\\" One suspects that this quote was taken out of context.<br /><br />For pure enjoyment, I liked \\"A Room With a View\\" best. It reads smoothly, and for anyone who has visited Florence, will bring back happy memories.	2005-09-14

For me, this book clears that hurdle easily, providing several such perceptions. To wit:<br /><br />1. Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court case legalizing abortion, produced a marked drop in the crime rate 20 years later because many children who came from high-risk backgrounds ended up not being born. Obvious once you think about it, but it had not occurred to me previously.<br /><br />2. Black drug dealers in Chicago, despite their limited formal education, ended up organizing themselves into the same broad-based pyramid hierarchical structure that is typical of American Big Business.<br /><br />3. Teachers in Chicago, who are rated based upon the performance of their students on standardized tests, ended up changing the students' answers before submitting them for grading to make their own performance as teachers seem better.<br /><br />4. The agent you retain to help you sell or purchase real estate generally has his or her own agenda, which usually runs counter to your interests. Anyone who has bought or sold real property knows this instinctively, but Levitt does a fine job of pointing out exactly how they screw you.<br /><br />What's interesting about all of these examples is that they are taken from the world of day-to-day business transactions, instead of the rarified economic theories that concern most academics. That Levitt is an economist at the University of Chicago, perhaps the finest economics faculty in America (certainly the one awarded the most Nobel Prizes in the subject), makes his achievement more impressive.<br /><br />The only downside to the book is that Dubner does not write particularly well, but Levitt's ideas manage to overcome that limitation.<br /><br />For readers who are interested in pursuing Levitt's ideas further, he maintains a blog that can be accessed over the Internet.	2005-07-29

He has succeeded.<br /><br />At the outset, he divides depression into two separate categories, Psychological Depressions and Biological Depressions, pointing out that the former lend themselves to self-help treatments and psychotherapy to get rid of cognitive distortions (negative thoughts), while the latter generally require medical treatment including medication. Perhaps most importantly, he provides useful checklists for quickly determining the difference between the two.<br /><br />For the majority who suffer from cognitive distortions, he provides several suggested treatments to break free from the whirlpool of despair that accompanies depression. These are designed to restore perspective to the person's life, and generally succeed.<br /><br />At the more serious end of the spectrum, Biological Depression, he discusses the relative merits of various medications and provides a useful overview of Bipolar Disorder (formerly known as Manic-Depressive Illness), which is becoming increasingly common.<br /><br />My only criticism is that he fails to say that a person who uses medication is likely to have trouble obtaining health insurance in the future because of the excessively high cost of these medications. While that information would discourage people from seeking treatment, it is a fact they should know.<br /><br />After receiving this book, I noticed that it is published by Impact Publishers, a small publisher located in Atascadero, California. I previously read another of their books (\\"Luck Is No Accident\\" by Krumholtz and Levin), which was also excellent. Judging from the listings of their other publications, they specialize in publishing high quality, clearly written, self-help and psychology books. Certainly this book fits that description.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-06-27

As in \\"The Stones of Florence,\\" McCarthy weaves a tapestry of art, history, literature, sociology and cogent observation, but this earlier effort is not as well organized as the later book, leaving the reader to dig out the gems that lay within.<br /><br />Apparently the original hardback versions of both books contained high-quality photographs, and were experiments in presenting the two modes of communication together. Depending upon which edition you buy, the paperback versions either lack photographs altogether or contain low-quality reproductions. While that obviously detracts from the experience, the text standing alone bears witness to an extraordinarily well-disciplined and fine mind at work.<br /><br />Since McCarthy was born in 1912, she would have been 44 at the time this book was written, hardly the ingenue that other reviewers suggest. In fact, after reading both books, one suspects that this woman was born mature.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that throughout this book, McCarthy refers to John Ruskin's \\"The Stones of Venice,\\" which explains her choice of title for \\"The Stones of Florence.\\"	2005-06-18

It is at such times that thoughtful people reach out for rational guides to living.<br /><br />To some extent, the Meditations provide that kind of guidance, but the reader looking for a comprehensive plan for living well is likely to be disappointed. Instead of an organized body of thought. the \\"Meditations\\" are simply haphazard thoughts that Marcus wrote down over the years as aids in developing his personal ethics. This does not mean that they are useless, simply that they are disorganized and repetitive.<br /><br />To the Stoics, everything is part of the natural order, including cruelty, pain and death. The function of the individual within this world is to suffer with dignity, restraining anger and being tolerant of the acts of others, recognizing that anything they do is in their nature and the natural order of things. The Stoic philosophy is basically pessimistic - Life's a losing battle, but in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter because we only spend a brief time here, before being recycled by nature. The human body is no more that \\"rotting meat in a bag.\\" (8.38)<br /><br />A pessimistic view, certainly, yet taken as a whole, the Meditations provide useful information for dealing with life's unpleasantries, most of which involve living the simple life - being modest and grateful for the good things that one has enjoyed, treating others politely and fairly, being indifferent to superficial honors and indicia of status, and living life honorably, simply and well during our brief moment on the stage.

He had a pleasant way of speaking, said intelligent things, and much to my delight, every time the audience would titter politely in the wrong places to show how hip they were, would ask in a perplexed voice, \\"What's funny about that?\\" (Are you listening Garrison Keillor?)<br /><br />I remembered Wilder from \\"Young Frankenstein,\\" but other than that, knew little about him, including his marriage to Gilda Radner. This was an advantage, since I approached the book without preconceived expectations.<br /><br />Having enjoyed the interview, I bought the audio CD version, and listened to it in the evening over several weeks while nursing a bad back. Audio books read by the author are usually a good buy, because the author adds meaning through pronunciation, timing, and inflection. Moreover, Wilder as an actor knows how to deliver his lines.<br /><br />He has spent his life as an intelligent misfit, and most of the book is taken up with his efforts to adjust to an outside world that proved both friendly and hostile. Thus his use of the psychiatrist Margie as a foil. One reader review suggests that Margie is merely a \\"hackneyed and lame device.\\" I disagree; it's clear to me that Wilder has undergone psychoanalysis throughout his adult life, and because he prefers women to men, I suspect that the model for Margie actually exists.<br /><br />The best parts of the book are his descriptions of various movies he worked in and people he has known. He makes a good case for at least some of the people in that world being decent, while excoriating others. I found his descriptions of dealing with racial issues to be particularly thoughtful and moving.<br /><br />As for other readers' criticisms:<br /><br />1. The book is not sufficiently serious: Wilder's previous literary experience was writing screenplays, which tend to focus on visual and auditory images, and be lean on intellectual content. So it is with this book, which is why I recommend buying the audio CD version. Anyone who has read novels by Terry Southern (also a screen writer) will recognize this phenomenon.<br /><br />2. He does not sugarcoat his relationship with Gilda Radner: Sorry folks, but successful actors make their livings pretending to be someone other than the person they really are, and so it appears to have been with Gilda.<br /><br />Henry James once observed that the only test for a novel is whether the author achieves what he set out to do. Applying that test to this book, I think Wilder meets it. Perhaps most importantly, he at least tried to be honest, and to a large extent, succeeds.with this book, which is why I recommend buying the audio CD version. Anyone who has read novels by Terry Southern (also a screen writer) will recognize this phenomenon.    2.

Henry James once observed that the only test for a novel is whether the author achieves what he set out to do. Applying that test to this book, I think Wilder meets it. Perhaps most importantly, he at least tried to be honest, and to a large extent, succeeds.	2005-06-11

Los Angeles, like New York, is a city that people either love or hate, but nobody thinks it's boring. That is, unless your only exposure to it is reading the traditional travel guide with its listing of Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Disneyland and Universal Studios.<br /><br />Stephen Brook breaks out of that mold. An English writer who came to L.A. in the early Nineties, he proceeded to criss-cross the city, visiting virtually every major neighborhood, from Pasadena to Watts, from Beverly Hills to Long Beach. Not only did he bring an Englishman's fresh eye to the city, but he somehow arranged introductions to some of the most interesting people in it. In reading the book, one gathers that his open mind resulted in their opening their minds and hearts to him. He is simply a nice person, which comes through in his writing.<br /><br />The writing is succinct. Each of the 32 chapters consists of approximately 10 to 12 pages discussing a different aspect of the city (His breakfast with Carver Mead at Caltech, in Chapter 20 is alone worth the price of the book).<br /><br />Brook's forte is architecture. Los Angeles arguably has the finest modern architecture in America, and Brook provides addresses, the name of the architect, and a brief description of each building, yet somehow avoids sounding like a cataloguer. He is also strong in describing the various museums throughout the city, many of which I was not aware of.<br /><br />At the same time, he is equally at home discussing the political, educational and gang situation in the city.<br /><br />All in all, a fine book.	2005-05-25

The translation that you choose will have an impact upon your enjoyment of any work written in a foreign language. In the case of The Decameron, the translations recommended by \\"The Oxford Guide to Literature in English Translation\\" are those by (1) G.H. McWilliams and (2) Bondanella and Musa.<br /><br />I purchased the McWilliams translation and found it to be enjoyable, although slightly wooden. There were also several howlers (e.g., addressing the women in the group as \\"Delectable Ladies.\\")<br /><br />There's a 100+ page introduction, which I found to be overly academic and tedious. This is, as far as most readers are concerned, a fun book to read; the introduction should not detract from that experience.<br /><br />This volume has extensive endnotes at the end of the book. Most of them are of little interest to the general reader and add nothing to one's enjoyment of the stories. Since they are short, and given modern editing technology, they could just as easily been included as footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear, which would have been more convenient. (Inexplicably, the notes to the Introduction are footnotes.)<br /><br />The book is bawdy, but not obscene. McWilliams, justifiably I think, is of the opinion that certain passages are misogynistic and homophobic, which seemed to me to be correct. The latter is odd, because Florence during the Renaissance was notorious throughout Europe for its large homosexual population (most of its great artists reputedly were gay). Forewarned is forearmed.<br /><br />I have not read the Bondanella and Musa translation, but McWilliams (who appears to be remarkably fair) speaks well of it in his Second Preface. Based upon the foregoing, I would choose it instead.	2005-04-18

Lewis which, like much of what one reads about the city, is generally positive.<br /><br />In searching out books on the subject, I had repeatedly come across references to \\"The Stones of Florence,\\" which I avoided because I viewed Mary McCarthy (1912 - 1989) as a sort of upscale Danielle Steel, a popular novelist incapable of perceptive insights. That assessment was wrong.<br /><br />Instead, from the first page, the reader is confronted with perceptive and knowledgeable opinions that challenge his or her own perceptions (e.g., the Florentines are a cantankerous, miserly bunch). You may not agree with her, but there is no doubt that she is highly intelligent and has seriously thought out her positions. In the end, the reader comes away with strong admiration for her intelligence, candor, and succinct writing style. For example:<br /><br />\\"Up until this time (the age of Michelangelo), sculpture and architecture had been relied on by the Florentines to affirm the strength of the Republic. That is why the Uffizi, beautiful as many of its paintings are, is only a picture gallery, while the Bargello and the Museum of the Works of the Duomo are Florence.\\" (p. 108).<br /><br />\\"The kind of vulgarity in decoration that is today thought of as middle-class seems to stem straight from Tuscany in the time of the Medici grand dukes (citing Cosimo I)... The interiors of the grand-ducal palaces and villas are sumptuously, stuffily ugly in a way that is hard to connect with a period that was contemporary, after all, with classic Palladio in the Veneto.\\" (p. 201)<br /><br />\\"Lorenzo the Magnificent was `incredibly devoted to the indulgence of an amorous passion', as Roscoe, his eighteenth-century biographer, puts it; his sexuality was uncontrollable, a perpetual bullish rut.\\" (p. 176)<br /><br />This is not a book for readers considering a first trip to Florence or for those whose sole exposure has been a whirlwind tour of the Uffizi, Duomo and David. It presupposes an in-depth knowledge of the city itself, its history and literature. Those who have that knowledge will find it thought-provoking and rewarding.<br /><br />The title of this book is explained by the fact that three years before writing \\"The Stones of Florence,\\" McCarthy wrote \\"Venice Observed,\\" in which she relied heavily on John Ruskin's masterpiece \\"The Stones of Venice.\\"<br /><br />Readers interested in an objective view of the Medici, particularly Lorenzo il Magnifico, should consider [[ASIN:0393328457 Medici Money: Banking, Metaphysics, and Art in Fifteenth-Century Florence (Enterprise)]] by Tim Parks.

The same intelligence, objectivity and goodwill that characterize his famous Essays appear in this travel journal as well, making it a joy to read. An excerpt:<br /><br />\\"On the eve of Easter I saw at Saint John Lateran the heads of Saint Paul and Saint Peter that are shown there, which still have their flesh, color, and beard, as if they were alive: Saint Peter, a white and slightly longish face, his color ruddy and inclined to the sanguine, a forked gray beard, his head covered with a papal miter; Saint Paul, dark, his face broad and stouter, the head bigger, the beard gray, thick. They are up high in a special place. The way of showing them is that they call the people by the sound of bells, and by fits and starts lower a curtain be-hind which are these heads, side by side. They Iet them be seen for the time it takes to say an Ave Maria, and immediately raise the curtain again; after that they lower it again in the same way, and this up to three times. They repeat this exhibition four or five times during the day. The place is about as high as a pike, and then there is a heavy iron grill through which you look. They light several tapers around it on the out-side; but it is hard to discern very clearly all the details. I saw them two or three times. The polish of these faces had some resemblance to our masks.\\" (p. 95)<br /><br />The heads are still in the church; unfortunately they are no longer displayed publicly.<br /><br />North Point Press' books are wonderful examples of the bookmaker's art, but the company went out of business quite a while ago. Be sure to buy their edition if you can find one. The Foreword by Guy Davenport and Introduction by Donald M. Frame are icing on the cake.	2005-02-25

As a result, they often have seen their work as \\"proving\\" the truth of the Bible where such a conclusion is unwarranted.<br /><br />Werner Keller obviously knows a great deal about archaeology, and his integration of historical movements with the Bible story is excellent, but he too falls into this trap. He fails to distinguish between fact and opinion, leaving the reader on his own to separate the two. The only way to do so is to read other books on the subject, at which point Mr. Keller's bias becomes clear. A helpful book to read in this regard is [[ASIN:006067542X Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures]]<br /><br />A separate problem with this book is that it is outdated--a fatal flaw when discussing a rapidly developing field like biblibal archaeology. As pointed out by another reviewer, Mr. Keller's acceptance of the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin is a howler that renders it difficult for the intelligent reader to accept his other conclusions.<br /><br />On a more positive note, Mr. Keller includes some interesting photographs and line drawings that illustrate many of the archaeological findings that he discusses.<br /><br />A fascinating video that discusses the interplay of archaeology and the Bible is [[ASIN:B001IBCS2S NOVA: The Bible's Buried Secrets]].

I thought it useful enough that I read it again twice at five year intervals.<br /><br />Since my copy was literally coming apart at the seams, I purchased this sixth edition, which contains most of the content of the second, but adds chapters about specific forms of writing (The Interview, The Memoir, Science and Technology, Business Writing, Sports, Humor, etc). Additionally, it includes many more examples of what Mr. Zinsser considers to be good writing, some from his own writings and many more from those of other writers.<br /><br />His selection of writers is so good that I recently purchased a copy of the book as a gift for a foreign student who asked me for list of recent quality American non-fiction.<br /><br />I like his writing enough that I have read several more of his books (\\"Writing About Your Life: A journey Into the Past,\\" \\"Writing to Learn,\\" and \\"Willie and Dwike\\"). I find him to be best in writing about memoirs, but like the rest of us he has a limited reservoir of experience, and tends to repeat himself across books. He likes \\"Willie and Dwike\\" best of all his books; so do I.<br /><br />He obviously has had a successful and happy life, which causes him to be a bit of a Pollyanna and critical of writers who write about the dark side of human nature. On the other hand, he does cite Mencken, Joseph Heller, Gary Trudeau and others of that persuasion, so not all is lost.<br /><br />It's a fine book that will make you both a better writer and a better reader.	2005-01-07

The resulting \\"Business Plan\\" is an incomplete, poorly researched, turgid description of their idea, with lots of spreadsheets attached (detailed monthly financial projections for the next ten years).<br /><br />What is overlooked is the fact that a good business plan serves as a road map for the operators of a business. The process of systematically analyzing your business and stating your plans simply in writing will force you to think through how you are going to deal with the various problems you are going to face.<br /><br />Like another reviewer of this book, after reading the descriptions of various books on the subject, I purchased three of them. This one is far and away the best of the three and of all those I've read in the past. It systematically takes you through the planning process (industry analysis, marketing and sales, the operating plan, the organization plan, and the financial plan) and provides useful and intelligent checklists at each stage.<br /><br />If you follow its guidance, you will end up with a useful plan for running your business.

Additionally, the latter two translations contain useful endnotes (footnotes would have been preferable) that explain references to people, places and things in the Moscow of the Thirties.<br />Despite these shortcomings, after reading all four translations, I found that I enjoyed the Ginsburg translation the most. Since I do not read Russian, I based that opinion on the facts that (1) for me, it read the most smoothly, and (2) the comic passages were simply funnier in her translation (Russians, justifiably consider the novel to be a comic masterpiece). I attribute these characteristics to the Ms. Ginsburg having been born and raised in the country of Byelorussia and her being a successful writer (in English!) in her own right.<br />Based upon those criteria, I rank the translations as follows:<br />1.

I chose Whittington & Pany because (1) it is succinct, (2) it presents auditing concepts clearly (although the authors do sugar coat the accounting scandals of the past 20 years and fail to give credit where credit is due by naming the firms involved in them), (3) the page layout is attractive and easy to read, and most importantly (4) my students preferred it over other texts (one student told me that she chose my class after looking through the assigned texts for all of the Auditing sections, an excellent idea).<br /><br />The current (15th ed.) has been brought up to date with a limited discussion of Sarbanes-Oxley and the PCAOB.<br /><br />The material is obviously dry, but I found that it was possible to make my classes more interesting by incorporating newspaper accounts of the more egregious audit failures in the assigned readings, and by being honest about the arrogance, greed and stupidity that are all too typical of the accounting profession today. This practice has brought complaints by the local offices of the major firms, to which my department head replied that they are welcome to come speak to the classes to explain their side of the story. To date, they have not accepted the invitation.	2004-05-18

Together they have collaborated to produce an excellent book that explains why we humans so often act in what appear to be irrational ways.<br /><br />The essence of their argument is that we human beings come from a long line of hunter gatherers, and are genetically ill-equipped to deal with many of the challenges we face in the modern world. Using specific examples, Burnham and Whelan describe how our genes drive us to make irrational decisions in the major areas of our life (work, love, friendship, sex, and consumption). Forewarned is forearmed. Once you've read this book, you'll have the necessary tools to anticipate and avoid failure.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-05-01

I read it after spending 7 days seeing what I thought were the worthwhile sights in Barcelona, and soon had a list of things I missed good for another 7 days. I recommend it to anyone planning a visit to Barcelona, since I am not aware of any other source of information about the city that is as comprehensive.<br /><br />Hughes does a fine job of describing the architectural history of the city, particularly the Modernisme (Art Nouveau) period, but wastes far too much time on Catalan music, literature and art, which even he admits are mediocre. You will do yourself a favor by skimming those chapters.<br /><br />Note that this book was written in 1993, after the city had been spruced up for the 1992 Olympics but still 11 years ago. It is an even better city today, with nice people, excellent and reasonably priced food, and plenty of things to see and do. The comparison that comes to mind is \\"Tuscany 25 years ago.\\"<br /><br />Apparently taking to heart some of the criticism of this book, Hughes wrote a revised version, \\"Barcelona the Great Enchantress\\" [ISBN: 079226794X] in 2003, a far more enjoyable read that reflects significantly better editing. Given a choice, I would read it first and only then buy \\"Barcelona\\" if I was interested in more detail.<br /><br />There is an excellent VHS tape of Barcelona [ASIN: 6303209777] that combines both ground and aerial footage. Well worth purchasing.<br /><br />Additional recommended reading: George Orwell's \\"Homage to Catalonia\\"	2004-03-21

Many other thinking Christians would consider that fact, whether true or not, irrelevant.<br />He then goes on to describe, in the WWJD [What Would Jesus Do] mold, how he thinks Jesus would have dealt with three sticky moral and ethical issues -- homosexuality (he would have been tolerant of it, if not a participant), suicide (he would allow it in appropriate circumstances), and the role of women in a male-dominated society (no real answer here). The stories in which he deals with these issues are well-written (Price is a professional writer who teaches English at Duke), but offer little insight into these issues, and little in the way of scriptural or historical support for his views.<br />The most useful thing in the book is an appendix entitled \\"Further Reading,\\" but that doesn't justify the cost.	2003-12-30

This book focuses on four aspects of that violence.<br />1. The persecution of the church in its early days, culminating in the murder of its founder, Joseph Smith;<br />2. The Mountain Meadow Massacre, the most disgraceful incident in the short history of the church, in which Mormons disguised themselves as Indians and acting upon the orders of Brigham Young, attacked and murdered 150 immigrants crossing southern Utah in a wagon train on their way to California;<br />3. The ongoing assaults and rapes perpetrated upon 12 to 14-year-old girls by men twice their age or more, often their own fathers, to perpetuate polygamy among fundamentalist Mormon sects (while the main LDS church does not officially condone bigamy, the state of Utah does little to discourage it); and<br />4. The brutal knife murders of an innocent woman and her innocent child by her brothers-in-law, Ron and Dan Lafferty, both fundamentalist Mormons.<br />Mr. Krakauer writes well and pulls no punches in writing about these events. Perhaps the most serious question that the reader comes away with is whether, given the unique background of the Mormons and their religion, they can ever be fully assimilated into American culture.<br />It is a book that you will remember.<br />Note: Mormon readers, like other religious enthusiasts, have an unfortunate habit of filling websites with recommendations for books that are little more than church propaganda, which makes it difficult to sort out the wheat from the chaff. Readers desiring more objective views of the church and its history should consider any of the following::<br />1. \\"Mormon America: The Power and the Promise\\" by Richard and Joan K. Ostling.<br />2. \\"No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith: The Mormon Prophet\\" by Fawn M.

He also writes clearly.<br />I was particularly interested in the sections on Alaska, because I was trying to figure out whether it would be interesting to me (I am not an outdoorsman), and if I do visit it, how to structure the trip.

Then I stumbled upon [[ASIN:0552146625 Class]] by Jilly Cooper, which provides a highly amusing view of the British class system, and realized that Fussell had modeled his book on hers.<br /><br />That's not to say that it's a rip-off. In fact, Fussell's genius lies in his having recognized a great concept and modified it for the American market. Additionally, he specifically credits Cooper at several points in his book.<br /><br />Having grown up in a middle-class family in Pomona, California, Fussell does not have an intuitive understanding of Northeastern snobbery, which may account for some of the weaknesses in this book. Far better in that regard are \\"Old Money\\" by Nelson Aldrich or several books on the subject by Lewis Lapham, both of whom grew up in wealthy families.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest weakness in the book is Fussell's description of Class X as the ideal class. The people he describes so favorably, including himself, appear to be little more than Aging Hippies, frozen in time.	2003-05-16

Eddy and the History of Christian Science	Books	5	35	43	N	Y	Banned in Boston	In 1906 Georgine Milmine, a newspaperwoman who had spent years assembling an enormous collection of material about Mary Baker Eddy but doubted her own ability to write on the subject, sold it to McClures Magazine. Interest in Christian Science was at its height at the time, and McClure's turned the project over to Willa Cather, who was 32 years old and had 32 published short stories to her credit, but whose days as a great novelist still lay in the future.<br />Although Ms. Cather publicly disclaimed credit for the resulting series of articles which form the basis of this book, the editors provide convincing proof that she wrote it.<br />In addition to being a highly entertaining account of the rise of one of the more fascinating characters in American religious history and the church she founded, the book provides extensive factual detail to anyone seriously interested in the history of either. While it is critical of Mrs. Eddy, it is also complimentary. Factually accurate and extensively documented., it is perhaps the most objective account available of a truly remarkable woman and her church.<br />Although the book was the subject of favorable reviews when it was published in 1910, the response of the church was, predictably, less enthusiastic. According to the afterword, even before it was published, \\"three spokesmen for the Christian Science church visited the McClure's office and tried to suppress the series of articles. Christian Scientists were said to have later bought and destroyed most copies of the book, and library copies were said to be kept out of general circulation through constant borrowings by church members... The copyright for the Milmine book was purchased by a friend of Christian Science, the plates from which the book was printed were destroyed, and the manuscript also acquired. That this happened is supported by the fact that the manuscripts for the 'Milmine' book are held in the Archives and Library of the First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston.\\" (pp. 497-498)<br />Perhaps the most important contribution that this book makes is to present Mrs. Eddy and her church in the context of their time. There is a tendency today to present her as an early oppressed feminist. That interpretation should be compared with Ms. Cather's hard-nosed assessment:: \\"The result of Mrs. Eddy's planning and training and pruning is that she has built up the largest and most powerful organization ever founded by any woman in America. Probably no other woman so handicapped-so limited in intellect, so uncertain in conduct, so tortured by hatred and hampered by petty animosities-has ever risen from a state of helplessness and dependence to a position of such power and authority... The growth of her power has been extensive as well as intensive.\\" (p. 480)<br />In fact, the only complaint in an otherwise favorable review by a student of nervous disorders in the American Historical Review (Vol 15, July 1910), was that the author did \\"not do enough to explain the abnormal psychology of the founder of Christian Science-the record of hysteria, hypochondria, and the delusion of persecution.\\" (p.498)<br />Well worth readingin Boston.\\" (pp. 497-498)<br />Perhaps the most important contribution that this book makes is to present Mrs. Eddy and her church in the context of their time.

The two notable exceptions to the rule are the Medici and the Rothschilds.<br /><br />I purchased this book thinking that the author would provide some insight into how the Rothschilds achieved their long-standing record of success. Unfortunately, Mr. Morton is merely a sycophant, apparently incapable of providing the kind of detailed analysis the question calls for. Instead, he constantly marvels at how this family of rag merchants from Jew Street in Frankfurt ended up hobnobbing with the crowned heads of Europe. That is certainly an accomplishment of sorts, but absent any kind of descriptive analysis, it is little more than fodder for People magazine. Indeed, one can argue that the recent decline in the family's fortunes is due to their emulation of European aristocracy.<br /><br />A far better book on the same topic is the two-volume set, \\"[[ASIN:0140240845 The House of Rothschild: Volume 1: Money's Prophets: 1798-1848]] and [[ASIN:0140286624 The House of Rothschild: Volume 2: The World's Banker: 1849-1999]].

They should have stayed the course, for the narrative improves as Ibn Battuta makes his way eastward to India and the Far East.<br />The reason it gets better is that Professor Dunn knows a great deal about that part of the world, and presents a fascinating discussion of its history and economics. While Europe was suffering through the Middle Ages, the Middle and Far East were the centers of civilization.<br />The interesting question is &quot;What went wrong?&quot; Why did these same countries freeze, while Europe entered the Renaissance?

He was to German tank warfare strategy what Rommel was to tactics. Adding in Mannstein, it is remarkable how much competence and intelligence surfaced among the Panzer generals, especially when compared to their counterparts in the infantry.<br />What I found most interesting about this book, however, were the insights it provided about Hitler. There has been a tendency, both during and after the war, to downplay Hitler's intelligence and abilities, which leaves the question of \\"If he was so stupid, how did he get so far?\\" What Guderian makes clear is that Hitler was exceptionally intelligent. Because Guderian was at his side at key times during the war, he provides personal insights that would not otherwise be available.<br />Perhaps the most disturbing item in the book, which was news to me, was Hitler's plan to gather the people of Germany together in the center of the country at the end of the war, destroy all bridges and other transportation links, and allow them to die of disease and starvation, a disaster that (according to Guderian) was only averted by actions that he and Albert Speer took.	2002-10-05

Given the multiple transformations that Sun has gone through (workstations, chip design, software design, servers, memory systems, enterprise hardware and software, and Java), as well as its famous feud with Microsoft and Mister Bill, that is no easy task, but they provide a succinct (225 page) and unbiased view that will be of interest to anyone who is interested in learning more about these subjects. The endnotes are particularly helpful.<br /><br />Although the authors were not able to interview McNealy (he turned down their request), they do include intelligent observations about him and Sun from knowledgeable persons both within and outside Sun. Given the shallowness of McNealy's public comments and statements in other interviews to date (one suspects that he is finally learning to put a governor on his mouth), the omission is not noticeable.<br /><br />It is rumored that Ms. Southwick is in the process of preparing a similar volume about Oracle and Larry Ellison.

Unfortunately, he is so well known for his SF writings that his reputation in that area tends to swamp recognition of his accomplishments in mathematics and computer science, as is evidenced by other reviews on this page.<br />Rucker's mathematical writings tend to focus on the more esoteric subjects of infinity and the fourth dimension. They include: (1) \\"Geometry, Relativity, and the Fourth Dimension\\" (1977); (2) \\"The Fourth Dimension: A Guided Tour of the Higher Universes\\" (1985); (3) \\"Mind Tools: The Five Levels of Mathematical Reality\\" (1988); (4) \\"Infinity and the Mind: The Science and Philosophy of the Infinite\\" by Rudy Rucker (1995); and (5) \\"Software Engineering and Computer Games\\" (To be published in Nov 2002). That he is regarded as a serious mathematician is evidenced by the fact that \\"Infinity and the Mind\\" is published by the Princeton University Press, one of the best publishers of books on mathematics, engineering and science in the world.<br />In the area of software, Rucker is known for his participation in developing \\"Chaos\\" ands \\"CA (Cellular Automata)Lab\\", two highly innovative software programs that came out about 20 years ago. Cellular automata, which produce screen images that appear to be  randomly generated patterns (in fact, the patterns are generated in accordance with simple rules) have been studied seriously by scientists (including Richard Feynman) interested in determining the patterns that underlie life. In fact, one of the earliest CA games was called \\"The Game of Life.\\"<br />Like Feynman, Rucker is a free spirit, interested in virtually everything he encounters in life. Fortunately for the rest of us, he also likes to write about it. Among the topics treated in this collection of his essays are: (1) what it's like to live in Lynchburg, VA with Jerry Falwell; (2) a visit to a semiconductor clean room; (3) his beloved dog, Arf; (4) the paintings of Peter Breughel; (5) visits to Japan, where Rucker's S/F is immensely popular; (6) a live sex show in Manhattan; (7) his life as a hippie and abuse of drugs; and of course (8) thoughts on the possible uses of cellular automata.<br />Through it all comes the impression of a very good, very open, mind at work.

Written for readers between the ages of 9 and 12, it is part of the Techies series, offering small-format books introducing significant figures in high-tech businesses. Other volumes in the series are about Marc Andreessen, Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos.<br /><br />In fact, it is far better than any other book published to date about Mr. Ellison, which range from the tedious (\\"The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison\\" by Mike Wilson) to the ridiculous (\\"The Oracle Edge\\" by Stuart Read and \\"ebusiness or Out of Business\\" by Mark Barrenechea). Note: \\"The Oracle of Oracle\\" by Florence M Stone has not yet been published as of the date of this review.<br /><br />This book is a masterpiece of simplicity, presenting clearly in 80 brief pages (small pages, large print) everything worth knowing about Larry Ellison.<br /><br />Mr. Ellison, of course, is not a particularly admirable character, which caused me to wonder why anyone would write a children's book about him. Be that as it may, the authors do not pull any punches in describing his checkered past. An example:<br /><br />\\"Occasionally, Ellison's shaky business practices caught up with him. In 1990 the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated Oracle for `pervasively inadequate accounting and billing practices.' It was a complicated way of saying that the government thought that Larry Ellison was a criminal. The investigation ended up costing the company $24 million. But the bad press was much worse. People began to doubt Oracle's honesty. The stock price plummeted, and Ellison personally lost more than $3 billion. But as he had in the past, Ellison simply refused to fail. He turned the company's image around-improving its customer support, halting the sale of `vaporware' (at least temporarily), and generally apologizing for being careless.\\"<br /><br />If only Mr. Ellison's other biographers would write so clearly, honestly and succinctly.	2001-11-27

A syndicated columnist, many of his columns about life in Hanover have been collected and published in \\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself,\\" an enjoyable book, but because of the nature of its source material (syndicated columns) also a simple and highly sanitized one. At no point is the reader confronted by complex intellectual concepts or any obscenities.<br />\\"In a Sunburned Country\\" is a different matter. Written as an integrated book, it is a wonderful introduction to the more intellectually complex aspects of Australia, as well as the funnier ones, providing fascinating anthropological, botanical, geological, historical, political and sociological insights about our friends Down Under. Prior to reading it, I had dismissed Australia as being little more than a very dull version of America in the Fifties; Like Bryson, I now view it as the most fascinating place on earth. Similarly, I had viewed Mr. Bryson as being a male Erma Bombeck; I now view him as one of the more intelligent writers I have encountered.<br />The Australian Tourism Authority should consider licensing this book and either giving it away to prospective visitors or otherwise using it to promote the country.

Jack Gourman is a former professor from the University of Michigan who compiles his rankings by calling professors in various departments at different schools and asking them which programs they think are the best in their field. Not a bad way to rank schools and programs if your sampling is statistically valid, but since Jack is vague about his methodology, we'll never know that. What we do know is that his rankings are noticeably skewed in favor of large state universities and especially the University of Michigan. For instance, most observers rank Harvard Stanford and Yale among the top three law schools, with Michigan between fifth and ninth, but Jack consistently ranks the Wolverines in the top three. (Hey! They've got a great football program, haven't they?)<br />This approach produces ludicrous results in his rankings of undergraduate institutions (a separate book), but is less of a problem with graduate programs which are (1) the province of larger universities, and (2) subject to fewer constraints in their acceptance of out-of-state residents.<br />The book is especially useful as a checklist of all of the major players in a particular discipline. Just remember to move all Big Ten schools down one to two notches, and the University of Michigan down three to four, and you'll end up with some pretty decent rankings.	2000-10-24

Unlike US News, Gourman is vague about how he weights the various factors he considers, but it appears that he weights these programs on a par with Mathematics and Physics.<br />Having said all of that, I found his lists useful as a cross-check against other rankings. For instance, Gourman lists the University of Delaware as one of the top 10 institutions in the country in Chemical Engineering. That's obvious once you think about it (Dupont is headquartered in Delaware), but I hadn't thought about it until I read his book.<br />In the meantime, Jack, if you want to be taken seriously, disclose your methodology.	2000-10-20

An egotistical liar who thinks nothing of stabbing his most  loyal followers (he has no friends) in the back, Mr. Ellison incessantly  whines about how lonely and misunderstood he is. Poor baby. As the famous  Chinese curse goes, \\"May all your wishes come true.\\"<br /><br />Although Mike Wilson  apparently likes and admires Larry, he fails to make his case. The man has  no redeeming virtue. The book suffers as a result, the reader being left  emotionally drained and disgusted. As Sophocles observed 2500 years ago, \\"I  would rather fail honorably than win by cheating.\\" Larry would rather win  by cheating.<br /><br />Since Larry is a member of the Vietnam Generation (he turned  21 in 1965), I had hoped that the author would include some discussion of  his attitude towards the military, particularly in light of the fact that  Larry recently purchased a jet fighter in which he stages mock dogfights  over the Pacific Ocean.

Frances comes across as an iron fist  inside a velvet glove, responsible for much of the success of Jimmy and the  organization, and Seaman's revelation that Frances prefers women to men  goes a long way towards explaining Jimmy's dalliances with  prostitutes.<br /><br />The Lewis-Swaggart-Gilley family is just as complex and  interesting as the Kennedys or the Bushes, and may also justifiably be described as part  of America's \\"aristocracy\\".

Prof. Zbarsky and his father, both Jewish, were treated well only until  their unusual skills (embalming bodies) could be replaced.<br />Despite that  fact, Prof. Zbarsky's description of life in Soviet Russia is remarkably  objective.

After noting that the percentage of self-employed  persons in America has declined from more than 90% in 1900 to approximately  5% today, Lapham makes the sobering observation that the key to success  today, as it was in feudal times, is to praise and fawn over the modern-day  aristocracy--our corporate and political &quot;leaders.&quot;<br />There will  be those who think that Mr. Lapham wildly overstates his case.

My students had an enormous amount of difficulty understanding it, due in large part to  gaps in the authors' logic.

Their medicine is just as  bad as the sickness it supposedly cures.<br />The people they set up as models  live well within their means, perhaps too much so. Life is a gift, meant to  be enjoyed, and the person who saves every shekel is just as sick as the  person who spends every one.<br />Very little in this book is new, despite the  fact that the authors seem to consider their &quot;findings&quot;  revolutionary. In 1966 the Federal Reserve Board commissioned a study of  who became wealthy in America. The finding was that people with their own  businesses, on average, ended up three times as wealthy as those who pull  W-2s. No surprise there--no guts, no glory.<br />During the 1970s Dr, Srully  Blotnick, a columnist for Forbes, conducted a study of 1000 people to find  out which ones became more successful, which he summarized in a book  entitled &quot;Getting Rich Your Own Way.&quot; The conclusion? That the  most successful people are those who do what they love and let the money  follow.<br />What is lacking in &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot; is any  sense of moderation. True, these people will die with lots of money and  personal security, but nothing else.	1999-05-09

The Life of Chesty Puller	Books	5	3	7	N	Y	Excellent But Biased	At the outset of this excellent biography, Burke Davis makes it clear that he is describing Chesty Puller's life from Puller's point of view, a point that seems to be lost on many readers.There is no question that General  Puller was an exceptionally brave individual, but at what cost? Much of his  early experience was gained in Haiti and Nicaragua against poorly trained  and equipped rebels who tended to fire high. Unfortunately, it did not  serve him or his men well against either the Japanese or the Chicoms--On  Peleliu, Puller's 1st Marines was the first regiment that had to be  withdrawn because of casualties. By way of contrast, the 5th Marines used  firepower more effectively and sustained fewer casualties.Unfortunately  this book came out just before the escalation in the Vietnam War, and  inspired many Marines to \\"charge the hill,\\" instead of relying on  firepower. As a result, the Corps lost many of its best officers and  noncoms early on. Overall, Marine casualties in Vietnam exceeded those in  World War II, all of which may help explain why Headquarters Marine Corps  seems to want to forget Chesty. Another factor was Chesty's immense  popularity with the troops, which came to be resented by other  generals.Burke Davis did a fine job in writing this book, but the  objective biography of Chesty Puller has yet to be written.Readers who  enjoy \\"Marine\\" should consider buying [[ASIN:034547581X We Were Soldiers Once...and Young: Ia Drang - the Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam]] by (Army) General Hal Moore, which is itself a fine study  in leadership--so much so that the Commandant placed it on the \\"must  read\\" list for all Marine officers.Semper Fi!	1999-04-03

Instead, because he is inordinately wealthy, he is viewed by his  admirers as something of a demigod.<br /><br />Mr. Lowenstein is one of those  admirers. Despite the rather clear evidence that Mr. Buffett's personal  life is a shambles, Mr. Lowenstein describes it in the most glowing terms.  Hey!

Unfortunately, you will gain nothing more by reading the first 20 chapters, which consist of undisciplined ramblings by an author who considers himself charismatic.

The criticism turned into an uproar on August 12, 1978, after an exhibition game between the Raiders and New England Patriots, in which Tatum made a vicious (but clean) tackle of Darryl Stingley that permanently paralyzed Stingley. That coupled with Tatum's unfortunate tendency to fire off his mouth, the \\"bad boy\\" image of the Raiders, and Raider Owner Al Davis' own conflict with Pete Rozelle and the NFL led to Tatum being characterized as an outlaw.<br />In his defense, Tatum responds, (1) professional football is a vicious and brutal game, (2) I was paid to hit people hard, and (3) I generally played up to but within the limits of the rules. He has a point. Half of the second book is simply a rehash (often verbatim) of the first book. The other half is taken up with stories about Tatum. Jack Tatum may have an interesting story to tell, but you won't learn it reading this book. Only the oldest die-hard Raider fans will find anything of interest in it.	1998-09-13

Marcus despises Al and is candid in describing his reasons. Anyone  who is not familiar with Al Davis might think Marcus is exaggerating, but  those who are familiar with him will find the criticism reasonable, if not  understated. Corroboration for his descriptions of Al's eccentricities may  be found in \\"Slick: The Silver and Black Life of Al Davis\\" by Mark Ribowsky  [ISBN: 0-02-602500-0], a highly entertaining biography that is now out of  print but may be available through a used-book service.<br />The other  interesting contrast is that between Marcus and his friend O.J. Simpson. As  Marcus described Nicole Simpson's death and the subsequent murder trial, I  kept asking how these two men, similar in so many ways, could have ended up  so differently. As I said at the outset, the real heroes of the book are  Marcus' parents.	1998-08-30

Ely does a fine job of describing the factors that led to the show's great popularity and the successful efforts of its creators, Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, to maintain that popularity.<br /><br />At a more sophisticated level, however, the book provides an intimate view of one of the great political events of this century, the American Civil Rights movement. Because Amos `N Andy was the only nationally popular series prior to 1960 featuring black characters, and because its creators and principal actors were both white, the show repeatedly drew both praise and criticism from the press and various organizations seeking to promote their own political agendas.<br /><br />Ely describes in detail how Gosden and Correll went to great lengths to keep the show from being viewed as racist, yet in the long run they failed. As he points out,!  that failure may have caused the major networks to shy away from shows featuring black performers and delay their introduction into television  for another 20 years.<br /><br />Having listened to Amos `N Andy on the radio as a child and subsequently watched it on TV, I like many other white Americans, was dumbfounded when the NAACP decided to attack it for being racist. For me at least, Gosden and Correll succeeded in their objective of establishing their characters as human types, not racial types. Sapphire was the spitting image of my best friend's mother, and Algonquin J. Calhoun came to typify every crooked lawyer (Is that redundant?) I later had the misfortune to meet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ely touches only peripherally on the black sitcoms of the 80s and 90s (e.g., \\"The Jeffersons\\" and \\"In Living Color\\") which I (and many other Americans) personally found to be racist.<br /><br />Despite dealing with a highly emotional topic, Ely has produced a lucid, objective and thought-provoking work! . His shortcomings consist of his failure to take into consideration the effects of the other great events of the period (the Great Depression, World War II, etc.) and his seeming assumption that all Americans cared about the Civil Rights movement. In fact, I think that more people (both black and white) cared more about putting food on the table and raising their families well.nsist of his failure to take into consideration the effects of the other great events of the period (the Great Depression, World War II, etc.) and his seeming assumption that all Americans cared about the Civil Rights movement.

Educated at St. Paul's and Harvard in the fifties, he was provided with all of the benefits that money can provide.<br /><br />Unlike the modern ultra-rich, however, he was also provided a conscience and a sense of duty to his community. This book is, in large part, his effort to justify his own existence and that of his fellows to a society that often views them as little more than leeches who had the good fortune to be born into great wealth. In my opinion, and I suspect his as well, he ultimately fails, but he does provide the best defense of inherited wealth that I have read. In the course of that defense, he provides great insight into how Old Money thinks -- F.
