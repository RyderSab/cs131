The back cover states the book is \\"packed with never-before-published advanced security techniques,\\" but I disagree with that assessment.  While I found all of the content helpful, between 1/3 and 1/2 of it is probably available in older books -- including several by publisher McGraw-Hill/Osborne.  Nevertheless, I find the strength of the network infrastructure security sections powerful enough to recommend Extreme Exploits.<br /><br />I found Extreme Exploit's most innovative material in chapter 1 (Internet Infrastructure), 2 (ISP Security Practices), 4 (Reliable Connectivity), 8 (Email Gateways, Filtering, and Redundancy), 10 (Sinkholes and Backscatter, and 14 (Performing the Assessment, Part 1).  These chapters introduced projects like RADB, IRRd, INOC-DBA (a VoIP \\"hotline\\" for ISPs), the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse (an anti-spam system), and Hashcash (to consume CPU cycles and frustrate spammers).  Subjects like questions to ask ISPs, ways to multi-home, and using anycast to improve redundancy were also welcome.  A comment that spammers are using people who register with porn sites to pass CAPTCHA tests really surprised me!  Ch 10's coverage of ISP sinkholes was clear, and I learned about triggered blackhole routing.  Advice on checking publicly announced routes was cool, especially the reference to the author's Pwhois system.<br /><br />Although the vulnerability and patch management information in ch 12 was fairly routine, I also liked the author's mention of recent industry projects like the NIAC vulnerability lifecycle and Common Vulnerability and Scoring System.<br /><br />Other chapters mainly covered topics found in other books, like Hacking Exposed, Gray Hat Hacking, or Hardening Network Security (all Osborne titles).  Most of the book contains sound advice, but I must disagree with several assertions made in ch 7 (Intrusion Detection and Prevention).  These include the \\"rejection\\" of the value of passive detection (p 116), the \\"logical transition\\" where detection and prevention converges into firewalls (p 116), the idea that intrusion prevention systems are \\"less prone to insertion and evasion attacks\\" (p 120), and \\"signature-based IDS normally do not have an understanding of the underlying protocol that they are examining and simply perform byte-by-byte pattern matching\\" (p 121).<br /><br />Almost all of the vulnerability assessment material could have been cut, aside from the BGP query and network infrastructure advice in ch 14.  The misnamed \\"exploiting digital forensics\\" chapter (16) tempts the reader into thinking it will cover anti-forensics, but really it's an overview of network-, host-, and memory forensics in 26 pages.  An excerpt from p 332 summarizes the problem with the chapter: \\"At this point, you might be asking, what do I do with the data?\\"  Still, ch 16 deserves an honorable mention for describing multiple tools with which I was not familiar or had only passing familiarity.  These included Foremost by Jesse Kornblum and Kris Kendall, Disktype, and Memdump.<br /><br />In terms of structure, I liked the fact that every chapter concluded with a \\"checklist for developing defenses\\" summarizing important points in an actionable format.  The writing is always clear, and the diagrams are excellent.  Many of the network infrastructure suggestions are supported by command-line syntax and examples, consistent with Osborne's Hacking Exposed style.<br /><br />Overall, I think most everyone will learn something by reading Extreme Exploits.  Those with a decent amount of experience or who have read books already mentioned might find some of the book repetitive.  Despite this, I learned a lot about network infrastructure and I look forward to reading Victor's upcoming book on \\"Carrier Class Network Security.\\"ade in ch 7 (Intrusion Detection and Prevention).  These include the \\"rejection\\" of the value of passive detection (p 116), the \\"logical transition\\" where detection and prevention converges into firewalls (p 116), the idea that intrusion prevention systems are \\"less prone to insertion and evasion attacks\\" (p 120), and \\"signature-based IDS normally do not have an understanding of the underlying protocol that they are examining and simply perform byte-by-byte pattern matching\\" (p 121).   <br /> <br />Almost all of the vulnerability assessment material could have been cut, aside from the BGP query and network infrastructure advice in ch 14.

It is refreshing to read a book that doesn't waste time by assuming the reader has no networking background.  IPv6 Network Administration achieves just the right balance between history, theory, and practical application to serve the needs of administrators and interested readers.  If you've been waiting for the right resource from which to learn IPv6, this book is it.<br /><br />The preface, a less than useful part of many books, offers an interesting history of IPv6 development.  Rather than assume IPv4 is worthless, ch 1 and 2 debate IPv4's merits; ch 1 is anti-IPv4 and ch 2 is pro-IPv4.  In ch 3 we learn IPv6 details, and here the authors' writing style and judgement shines.  They avoid describing every detail of IPv6, and instead summarize or present just the important parts of the protocol.  This technique could have earned the book the title \\"Practical IPv6\\".<br /><br />Another smart choice made by the authors involves relating IPv6 concepts in IPv4 terms, where possible and appropriate.  For example, ch 3 shows how neighbor solicitation fulfills a role similar to ARP.  It will be many years before any student of networking will have to ignore learning IPv4, so I appreciate authors who speak in familiar terms.<br /><br />Beginning in ch 5 and elsewhere, the authors make a third excellent decision.  Rather than just present a Linux command reference and a Windows command reference, they present syntax for many operating systems and networking devices.  This must have taken a decent amount of research, but such level of detail makes the work accessible to a wide audience.  I found the use of FreeBSD in repeated examples to be particularly appealing.<br /><br />The authors are not shy about saying what works and what doesn't when IPv6 is involved.  In ch 7 they present some novel ways to work around certain issues, e.g., using netcat6 for port forwarding IPv6 traffic.  They even show programming examples and outline new aspects of the sockets API to handle IPv6 addressing in ch 8.<br /><br />Finally, IPv6 Network Administration presents workable ways for admins to give IPv6 a try, such as 6to4 and other tunnel methods.  Almost anyone with a public IP address should be able to experiment with IPv6 thanks to the book's directions.  Given that I operate multiple IPv6-capable systems in my lab, I was able to test some of the book's commands using link-local addressing (described in the text).<br /><br />In brief, this is a must-have book for all network administrators.  Even if you never intend to deploy IPv6, you should understand it as a professional technician.  As a personal observation, I see many opportunities for intruders to exploit misconfigurations, poor coding, and various complexities in IPv6 (such as the huge variety of addresses assigned to single machines).  IPv6 Network Administration will help get an IPv6 network running, at least to the point where administrators can begin becoming familiar with this new network protocol.n show programming examples and outline new aspects of the sockets API to handle IPv6 addressing in ch 8. <br /> <br />Finally, IPv6 Network Administration presents workable ways for admins to give IPv6 a try, such as 6to4 and other tunnel methods.

I read Network Security Evaluation Using the NSA IEM (NSE) to get a better understanding of the IEM side of the equation.  I found the business process coverage of this book helpful, along with the general understanding of the goals of the IAM and IEM.  For these two reasons you may find NSE helpful too.<br /><br />The Prologue, ch 1, ch 2, and Part I (which oddly begins with ch 3 and ends with ch 6) occupies about 40% of the book.  None of the material is technical, but it helps the reader understand why the NSA IAM and IEM exist, how the methodologies help clients, and what you as a security consultant owe clients when providing an IEM-centric service.  These business issues, which largely sit outside the NSA's purview, are very helpful for those of us trying to provide good services to clients.  I found contracting advice in ch 2 to be especially useful.  Warnings about scope creep, salespeople over-promising, and setting expectations all rang true.  I also liked the legal section (ch 5), but I wished it had avoided trotting out the tiresome links to \\"cyber terror\\"; cut pages 100-103 in the second edition!  I did learn a critical legal lesson, however: consultants should avoid even the pretense of interpreting laws like SOX or HIPPA when advising clients.  This could be misconstrued as \\"practicing law,\\" which is illegal without a license!<br /><br />Part II discusses \\"on-site\\" evaluation issues, which for ch 8-10 means discussing tools to accomplish the ten IEM baseline activities.  These tool sections were fairly generic, and anyone with decent security experience will not learn anything new.  One exception for me was Ophcrack, a recent password cracker.  Ch 9 boasted of getting Unix-centric Nessus to run on Windows using Cygwin, but disappointed by providing no further details.  Ch 10 mentions network protocol analysis as the tenth IEM baseline activity, but has nothing helpful to say besides mentioning running Ethereal or EtherPeek.  If the purpose of protocol analysis is discovering insecure protocols or cleartext passwords, avoid Ethereal -- run a password grabber like dsniff or similar.<br /><br />Part III addresses tasks done in the post-evaluation phase, like report-writing and delivery.  Some of the material is superfluous and preachy, e.g. p 316 \\"Knowledge is individualistic.  It is inherent to individuals and is acquired through the natural process of experience and learning.\\"  Ch 14 finally displays the 17 IAM (not IEM) categories, which had been alluded to in previous chapters but never explained (which would have been helpful for those unaware of the IAM).  The sample Technical Evaluation Plan in Appendix B is a good way to provide concrete examples for IEM beginners.<br /><br />I would like to see a second edition of NSE after an editor reads the entire book, as I just did.  That editor should strive to remove as much extra and redundant information as possible.  For example, there are sections repeated nearly word-for-word in ch 2 (p 40-43) and ch 4 (p 74-78).  The risk triangle appears on p 246 and 383.  CVE is introduced in ch 7 and again in ch 13.  Calculating ROI is presented in ch 3 and again in the same words in ch 14.  These duplications are the result of ten people contributing to a 400 page book.<br /><br />Overall, I still recommend reading NSE.  I return to the first 170 pages of the book for its best advice, such as entire chapter on scoping an engagement (ch 4).  There are far too few security books that explain how to deliver a valuable service to a client.  NSE addresses that issue in great detail, and for that reason I commend the authors.ctivity, but has nothing helpful to say besides mentioning running Ethereal or EtherPeek.

US	49796397	RJUPWY647RC93	0596007914	140912259	Snort Cookbook: Solutions and Examples for Snort Administrators	Books	3	24	25	N	N	Good information overshadowed by outdated or poor advice	I read the Snort Cookbook because I am always trying to learn more about Snort.  I've read almost every book on the open source intrusion detection system, so I hoped the Snort Cookbook might offer advice not found elsewhere.  Unfortunately, whatever good material appears in the book is overshadowed by outdated or outright bad advice.  The best Snort book is still Syngress' Snort 2.1, so I recommend reading that title.<br /><br />The Snort Cookbook starts poorly with ch 1, which at 50 pages is the book's largest.  After repeating installation instructions covered in online resources, the book turns to dubious packet collection recommendations.  Item 1.10 suggests creating a listen-only Ethernet cable but never mentions disabling ARP traffic with ifconfig's -arp option.  Item 1.11 describes how to build a homebrew tap but doesn't address signal regeneration problems that could result in traffic loss.<br /><br />Item 1.12 gives terrible advice: \\"If your Snort machine has only one network interface, using the passive tap, run both lines to a small hub. Then from another port of the hub, run a cable to your IDS. This will combine and maybe even buffer the traffic for the IDS and give a full duplex connection.\\"  Wrong -- this is a nice way to never see traffic when full-duplex packets from the two transmit lines collide in the hub.<br /><br />Item 1.14 says \\"Snort itself is incapable of sniffing a wireless network,\\" but it ignores the fact that while Snort doesn't understand 802.11 traffic, the sensor can join a wireless network and interpret what it sees.  Item 1.15 demonstrates more ignorance of hardware issues by saying \\"Linux-compatible gigabit Ethernet cards are available with up to six ports.  Coupled with machines that have space for three or four PCI cards, you could have as many as 24 Ethernet ports.\\"  This suggestion completely ignores the fact that a single gigabit NIC will saturate a 32 bit, 33 MHz PCI bus, and many BIOS will not be able to handle interrupts from more than about 8 NICs in a PC.<br /><br />Item 1.25 says \\"two to four million records is the max for MySQL,\\" which is odd.  One MySQL database I use to collect session data on Sguil has over 31 million records.  Item 1.25 also covers the often-repeated and incredibly naive method of having Snort log directly to a database, without utilizing Barnyard as an intermediary.  Thankfully we see Barnyard covered in ch 2, but recommended for \\"high-speed network[s], such as 1 Gbps or greater.\\"  Barnyard is definitely appropriate when monitoring at less than gigabit speeds.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the obsolete ACID Web-based alert console appears.  BASE has been available since October 2004; it addresses stale code problems in ACID and should have been covered.  I was disappointed to see the Sguil suite mentioned but never given any discussion, even though the older Snort 2.1 book introduces using Sguil.  Item 4.2 mentions \\"RST scans\\" even though they are a fiction of one security researcher's imagination.  Item 6.6 claims to offer ways to test Snort by showing three programs (Snot, Sneeze, Stick) that have had little effect on modern Snort implementations (e.g., 2001 on).<br /><br />On the positive side, in many cases the Snort Cookbook properly addresses questions which frequently appear on the snort-users mailing list.  Items 2.15 and 2.16 show how to send Snort alerts to email, a pager, or cell phone using Syslog and Swatch.  Item 3.2 discusses rule updates with Oinkmaster.  Rule issues in ch 3 were generally helpful, like dynamic rules (3.4), evasion issues (3.10), optimization (3.13), and even Spade (3.18).  Perfmon coverage in items 4.6 and 7.0 help discover how well Snort is working.  I also liked the policy-based IDS ideas in item 7.5.<br /><br />The back cover of the Snort Cookbook says the book \\"can save you countless hours of sifting through dubious online advice or wordy tutorials.\\"  That online advice is frequently more correct than what appears inthis book.  While some of the book is helpful, often that material has already been introduced in online documentation or best covered in Syngress' Snort 2.1.  Perhaps a second edition will address the concerns in this review and produce a more useful cookbook for future readers.n what appears in this book.

Most people who hear about host integrity monitoring nod their heads and agree that performing it is a good idea.  These same people usually don't implement HIM, and frequently cannot count the number of hosts, operating systems, and applications working in their enterprise.  Thankfully, HIM provides a way to use open source tools to help remedy this situation.  Consistent with the Visible Ops methodology, HIM  provides guidance on how to keep track of host integrity.<br /><br />When writing HIM, author Brian Wotring could have easily concentrated on the program he coded -- Osiris.  Luckily for readers, Brian chose to address his program and another open source host integrity monitor -- Samhain.  By comparing and contrasting these two programs, readers learn more about each and understand the capabilities and limitations of each application's approach to the HIM problem.  Consistent with this dual methodology, Brian explains how to install Osiris on both Unix and Windows platforms.  (Samhain is mainly a Unix solution.)<br /><br />The first third of the book provides background information on HIM rationales and planning.  I was initially inclined to skip ahead, but I found the explanations of monitoring various system elements to be helpful.  Brian's view of security closely mirrors my own, but he approaches it from a host-centric view.  He still accepts that prevention eventually fails and that preparation for incident response is a necessity, not a luxury.  Brian also correctly uses the term \\"threat\\" and recognizes threats are not vulnerabilities.  Bravo.<br /><br />The middle third and some of the final third of the book deal exclusively with installing and configuring Osiris and Samhain.  The instructions are wise and very thorough.  I was impressed by guidance on how to compile and install Osiris on Windows from source, using MinGW and MSYS.  I also liked the book's frequent use of FreeBSD as a Unix reference platform.<br /><br />I found a few minor issues with HIM, and one major drawback that prevented a five star review.  First, I disagree with the statement on p 19 that \\"most attacks originate from within the network by authorized users.\\"  The annual CSI/FBI study has repeatedly shown this to not be true; rather, insider attacks, when they do occur, are typically more damaging that those perpetrated by outsiders.  Second, I found some minor rough editing, e.g. \\"Nimbda\\" repeatedly used in place of \\"Nimda.\\"  Third, and most important, it would have been extremely helpful to have shown case studies of Osiris and Samhain in action when detecting configuration changes and/or intrusions.  I left the book with a lot of ideas on installation and configuration, but it would have been helpful to see case studies on using host-based data to identify intrusions.<br /><br />I am adding HIM to my recommended reading list for system administrators.  HIM gives administrators the documentation and theory they need to add another critical tool to their security arsenal.  I would like to see a second edition that adds case studies, and perhaps chapters on using Radmind for open source change management.GW and MSYS.

I had not heard much about the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), but I was familiar with the problems caused by poor administration.  I perform network incident response (IR), so I am often asked to solve problems in three days that clients have been confronting for three months or years.  After reading Visible Ops, I will recommend it to every IR client who asks me to remediate intrusions.<br /><br />Simply put, Visible Ops provides four simple steps to stop the IT insanity.  The book offers a quote attributed to Albert Einstein on p 42: \\"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different result.\\"  Many organizations have unintentionally embraced this concept, continuing to pursue the same broken administration techniques and wondering when they will ever stop fighting fires.  The Visible Ops process is the answer they have been pursuing.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of the book is its narrative examples.  These contain quotes by real administrators and managers and address problems like \\"the DHCP server, running on a DNS server, built four years ago by a college intern, that no one touches nor understands.\\"  Another similarly amusing (and sad) section presents seven steps in the \\"spectrum of change\\" on p 36.  This ranges from the poor end, like \\"Oblivious to Change: 'Hey, did the switch just reboot?'\\" and \\"Aware of Change: 'Hey, who just rebooted the switch?'\\" to the most mature option, \\"Managing Change\\".<br /><br />In terms of the booklet's advice, I found it rock solid, especially this recommendation: when a problem occurs, don't log into the infrastructure and begin troubleshooting.  Rather, check to see who made the last configuration change.  Since \\"80% of IT and system outages are caused by operator and application errors,\\" and not intruders, those confronting an incident should always begin by looking at themselves, and not outside \\"hackers.\\"<br /><br />I also found Appendix A, Preparing for Audits, to be a succinct and helpful look at the worldview of the auditor.  The \\"Controls 101\\" section described preventative, detective, and corrective controls, which reminded me of the protection, detection, and response phases of the security process.  Advice on p 70 also made sense in light of the debate over intrusion detection systems vs \\"intrusion prevention systems\\": \\"Document your preventative controls, and have detective controls in place to show they work.\\"  If your IPS is both a preventative and detective control, how do you check when it has failed?<br /><br />I found few reasons to dislike Visible Ops, but I had enough issues to give only four stars.  First, the book needs to be printed in a bigger form factor.  The problem with Visible Ops is that its small size (5x7) reduces some of the fonts used in various tables to be almost illegible.  Second, the booklet is too internally repetitive.  This is especially true in the appendices, where points continue to reappear.<br /><br />Third, I fear that the book, along with all those taking an audit-centric approach to security, sees controls as the be-all, end-all of the security process.  It seems too much attention is paid to preventing incidents, with not enough resources devoted to detection and response.  Corrective controls, for example, do not receive the attention they deserve.  Rebuilding from bare metal is the recovery action of choice in Visible Ops, but rebuilding another vulnerable server strays towards the definition of insanity mentioned earlier.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend everyone associated with IT, security, operations, and audit read Visible Ops.  The booklet is small enough to read in a few hours, since the main material and Appendix A ends on p 73.  I look forward to more extensive materials from this excellent team of authors.ident should always begin by looking at themselves, and not outside \\"hackers.\\" <br /> <br />I also found Appendix A, Preparing for Audits, to be a succinct and helpful look at the worldview of the auditor.

This book delivers just what a technical Cisco book should: discussion of concepts, explanation of command syntax, and practical examples.  The author offers several ways to solve a security problem and then recommends his preferred choice.  He correctly leans towards applying cryptography when available and avoids clear-text authentication methods or control channels.  If you avoid the first chapter and keep a few minor caveats in mind, I would consider CRFS to be a five-star book.<br /><br />CRFS covers all of the major technologies I hoped to see in a book on Cisco security functions.  Though published in August 2004, it manages to provide details on the newest Cisco IOS features that contemporary books often ignore.  For example, the author emphasizes the benefits of configuring SSH access, and not only SSHv1; he explains that SSHv2 is preferred.  I found the book's coverage of access control lists to be very clear, and I appreciated the author's discussions of strengths and weaknesses of different ACL types.  Mr. Deal is also very conscious of the load placed on the router whenever higher-end security features or traffic inspection is invoked.  His warnings provide operational insights to using IOS security features.  Beginning with chapter 3, each section presented just the information I needed to implement various security features.<br /><br />I gave CRFS four stars, and not five, because I found some of the author's perceptions of security to be confusing or sometimes wrong.  He repeats at least five times the oft-quoted but never substantiated myth that \\"70 percent of network attacks\\" are internal.  This is completely backwards, according to CSI/FBI and Secret Service studies that say around 70 percent of attacks are caused by outsiders.  While some of the most devastating incidents are indeed perpetrated by insiders, the majority of attacks continue to be launched from outside the security perimeter.  While this point may not seem that significant, it is not a solid footing on which the author can justify certain security recommendations.<br /><br />While reading CRFS I also sensed that neither the author nor his technical editors were security professionals.  I do not mean that they do not or have not handled security incidents.  In fact, several of Mr. Deal's stories explicitly and properly address intrusions and other events.  Rather, I sensed the author and his team were networking professionals first, with security duties tacked on.  For example, p. 8 lists applications, the OS, and network infrastructure as \\"threats to your company's network.\\"  These have vulnerabilities -- they are not threats.  On p. 28 Mr. Deal says \\"SSL can protect only web application traffic,\\" but this is wrong.  Pages 31-33 lists \\"some of the most common\\" DoS attacks, but the explanations there of chargen and ping of death attacks are wrong.  WinNuke, a Windows DoS exploit from 1997, is also listed!  Page 94 says \\"IDS solutions are still in their infancy,\\" although they have been deployed for over 10 years.  These and related security misperceptions made me believe a person with a primary security role should have reviewed CRFS.<br /><br />It is easy to overlook these security faux pas, however.  CRFS does a better job describing some security issues than other security-focused books.  For example, I found the coverage of the effects of DoS attacks upon a router to be better than books specifically written about DoS!  Mr. Deal frequently advocates monitoring as a way to know what is happening on the network, and I found his IDS deployment guidance to be sound.<br /><br />To the extend I could evaluate Mr. Deal's discussion of Cisco features, I believe they are correct.  One notable exception involves using the established keyword with ACLs.  On p. 269 and elsewhere, the author claims \\"the established keyword looks to see if the ACK, FIN, PSH, RST, SYN, or URG TCP control flags are set.  If they are, the TCP traffic is allowed in.\\"  This is incorrect; established looks for only the ACK or RST flags.  This is not a major concern as other filtering options provide better defense anyway.<br /><br />Overall, I consider CRFS to be an excellent piece of work.  I am adding it to my recommended reading lists and I strongly suggest than anyone using Cisco routers in their perimeter read and heed this book.  Keep an eye out for Mr. Deal's next book on building VPNs with Cisco gear.SYN, or URG TCP control flags are set.

US	49796397	R2UXX5NSN3GT8R	155860913X	966310072	The Internet and Its Protocols: A Comparative Approach (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Networking)	Books	5	11	11	N	N	A modern protocols book for all networking practitioners	Adrian Farrel's 'The Internet and Its Protocols' (TIAIP) blew me away.  I read this book because it explains the Internet I know, but also how new protocols work with that Internet and make it different from the network I first encountered over a decade ago.  Farrel's amusing yet clear writing style delivers a great deal of knowledge in a hefty hardcover.  If you want to learn about the protocols that make the Internet work, you need to read TIAIP.<br /><br />One of the strongest aspects of TIAIP is the inclusion of protocol header figures for every protocol mentioned.  I considered this an absolute must for any new protocol book I purchase, and Farrel delivers.  Unlike some other books that rely on generic box line drawings, TIAIP's figures are bit-specific.  In other words, the header at the top of the figure shows where each bit lies.  The diagrams are also all in the same format, facilitating comparison between headers.<br /><br />Comparison is another strength of TIAIP.  Farrel doesn't just present protocols and leave the reader to work out their strengths and weaknesses.  In most sections he spends time helping readers choose which protocol will best suit their needs.  This is both practical and educational.<br /><br />There is a ton of information in this book, so much that it may be better used as a reference than a read-through title.  I admit to not reading every page, especially those that featured large diagrams of header options and their meanings.  This level of details is perfect when I need to understand exactly how a protocol functions, however.<br /><br />I'll mention a few topics that were fairly new to me and appeared in TIAIP.  Topics like multicast (ch 3); DiffServ and IntServ (ch 6); SCTP and RTP (ch 7); MPLS (ch 9); GMPLS (ch 10); GSMP (ch 11); and header compression (ch 15) were all well documented.  Farrel is heavily involved in MPLS issues, which is of benefit to the reader.  MPLS seems to be appearing in many places outside the ISP realm.<br /><br />I found a few issues with TIAIP, some of which author Farrel was kind enough to acknowledge via email.  P. 50 switches the ARP and InARP meanings in table 2.10.  In ch 5 on p. 118, the 172.19.168.16/28 and 172.19.168.32/28 networks can be summarized as 172.19.168.16/27, not 172.19.168.32/27.  I would have liked to have read more on EIGRP, even though it's a Cisco proprietary routing protocol.  Also, ISO does not mean 'International Standards Organization'; ISO is the 'International Organization for Standardization.'  They use ISO, derived from the Greek word for equal, to avoid international language issues.  For example, the English acronym would be IOS, and the French would be OIN.  Clearly I put these minor issues aside when I rated TIAIP five stars; the amount of value this book delivers is incredible.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that shows you real details on Internet protocols in a thorough and engaging manner, I highly suggest considering TIAIP.  I am adding it to my recommending reading lists today.ISP realm.   <br /> <br />I found a few issues with TIAIP, some of which author Farrel was kind enough to acknowledge via email.

US	49796397	R1ABYMTTEQHUZT	1555583326	425121703	Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) Security	Books	3	21	24	N	N	Did not live up to expectations	I decided to read 'VoIP Security' because I thought it would describe VoIP protocols and ways to secure them.  The table of contents looked very strong and the preface seemed to meet my goals: \\"For one to truly understand Internet telephony, the reader must have a solid understanding of digital voice, telephony, networking, Internet protocols, and, most important of all, how all of these technologies are put together.\\"  Unfortunately, the book is confusing at times and is not an improvement over earlier VoIP security books.  So-called 'reviewers' who write that this book 'goes heavily into explaining the low level mechanics of VoIP' reveal they don't read the books they purport to review.<br /><br />Chapters 1, 2, and 3 discuss reasons to use VoIP, how voice is encoding into digital form, and telephony history.  I found the wire pair discussions in ch 3 confusing; additional diagrams might have helped.  Some text in the existing figures is so small as to be nearly illegible.  Ch 4, on 'packet technologies,' is the worst in the book.  Many of the 'functional activities by layer' in figure 4.1 are wrong (e.g., routing at layer 2).  Page 89 says 'the IP identification number is mainly useful for identifying anomalous signatures.'  While IP fragmentation is mentioned, that correct function of the IP ID seems played down.<br /><br />The most frustrating part of ch 4 is the sudden discussion of the H.235 protocol, with absolutely no introduction to its purpose or what it is.  This is especially unfortunate as the preceding 20 pages were wasted describing basic IP networking.  H.235 is not explained until ch 8.  Similarly, p. 102 and elsewhere compares SIP to H.323, without explaining H.323 or SIP!  H.323 is tangentially covered in ch 8, and SIP makes an appearance in ch 5.  A chapter that should have been the core of the book -- explaining VoIP protocols -- is its weakest.  At the very best, this shows the book is poorly organized.<br /><br />After presenting generic VoIP deployment issues in ch 6, ch 7 catalogs various VoIP security risks and ch 8 offers VoIP security best practices.  I was surprised to realize that chs 7 and 8 are the only sections that really mention security at all, in a book called 'VoIP Security.'  I did not find this material compelling, as much of it delivered generic security guidance -- some of it wrong.  On p. 192 we read that 'Linux can be crashed with one pair' of fragmented IP datagrams (wrong).  On p. 193 we read 'each broadcast address can support up to 255 hosts' (wrong, only true for /24 netblocks).  On p. 263 we read 'rather than looking at one frame at a time, as with firewalls, NIDS usually don't add delay because they look across a broad collection of frames flowing in either direction' (what?).  I got the impression this book suffered due to lack of digital security experience on the part of the authors and editors; they seemed much more like telecom practitioners.<br /><br />Ch 9 presents legal issues in security (not really related to VoIP), and ch 10 concludes with a short 'future of VoIP.'  I finished this book not much more informed about VoIP security than when I started.  In fact, I turned to the older 2001 SAMS book 'Voice and Data Security' by Archer, et al, and found it covered protocols and security issues much better than 'VoIP Security.'<br /><br />If Elsevier decides to print a new edition of this book, they should encourage the authors to take a hard look at what they discuss and where they discuss it.  They should also consider what they omit.  I think a real VoIP security book should explain how to configure and deploy the open source PBX Asterix and a VoIP proxy like siproxd for SIP.  The new edition should do more than mention tools like 'voice over misconfigured internet telephones'; show them and others in action.  Avoid the generic network and security discussions and concentrate on the topic at hand.ric VoIP deployment issues in ch 6, ch 7 catalogs various VoIP security risks and ch 8 offers VoIP security best practices.

US	49796397	R23X2RIMGWA13H	1931836205	207831983	Aggressive Network Self-Defense	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Entertaining and informative fiction on digital strike-back	'Aggressive Network Self-Defense' (ANSD) is another innovative Syngress book.  It leaps beyond the theories of digital self-defense initially proposed by Tim Mullen in 2002.  Tim tried to justify using 'neutralizing agents' to disable malicious processes (like Code Red or Nimda) on infected hosts attacking one's enterprise.  ANSD does not speak of neutralizing agents in the eight fictional cases the comprise the bulk of the book, but those chapters make for thought-provoking reading.<br /><br />The first eight chapters present creative scenarios where digital strike-back may or may not be justified.  Chapter 1 explains how a PDA user retaliates against a miscreant who installs a backdoor on his Pocket PC device.  This is a highly technical section where ARM assembly language and virus creation are discussed.  In chapter 2 a rogue wireless cafe employee sets up a man-in-the-middle attack to steal customer credit card data.  Chapter 3 shows how a game developer retaliates against a software thief.  Chapter 4 demonstrates the trouble in which a system administrator can find himself when he installs an unauthorized VPN connection.  Chapter 5 -- probably my favorite -- describes hardware and software keyloggers, along with Bluetooth monitoring, to catch a college campus intruder.  In chapter 6 two over-zealous administrators decide to patch any machines which attack their honeypots.  Chapter 7 is another creative section, where attacker and defender fight for control of a network using unorthodox methods.  In chapter 8, a security audit reveals a rogue member who tries to infiltrate a government agency.<br /><br />I liked all of these chapters.  I had a slight problem following the logic in chapter 3, where it was unclear how the intruder compromised sshd to access the victim's system.  In all other cases, I found the scenarios plausible and technically accurate.  My only real concern with these chapters were many of the screen shots; most were far too small to make the text in the images legible.<br /><br />ANSD is weaker in the second half, as fiction makes way for discussions of strike-back.  All four chapters are previously published material; three are available on the Web right now.  I would have preferred more fictional case studies and fewer reprinted papers.  The book cover seemed to indicate that legal concerns would be analyzed in the text, but I found nothing authoritative beyond the fate of a few fictional perpetrators.<br /><br />I recommend those considering digital strike-back read ANSD.  Only one of the chapters is close to Tim Mullen's ideal, where neutralizing agents directly disable attacking processes on compromised systems.  In many cases the activities of the protagonists in ANSD would land them in jail.  In a few chapters, that is the explicit end result!  ANSD is a thought-provoking exploration of digital strike-back.  Its case study method would be appropriate in classes for security managers and other students.the text in the images legible. <br /> <br />ANSD is weaker in the second half, as fiction makes way for discussions of strike-back.

US	49796397	R122I5D9YLW3YL	193226647X	842550361	Intrusion Prevention and Active Response: Deploying Network and Host IPS	Books	4	2	4	N	N	A solid examination of open source solutions	'Intrusion Prevention and Active Response' (IPAAR) is a good book, as long as you confine your expectations to open source solutions.  The foreword says 'Security professionals are going to be approaching management for funding in the next year or two to procure intrusion prevention devices, especially intelligent switches from 3Com (TippingPoint), as well as host-based intrusion prevention solutions like Cisco Security Agent, Platform Logic, Ozone, or CrossTec.'  This foreword was the first time I had heard of several of these products, but unfortunately none of them receive any coverage at all in IPAAR.  Aside from a short discussion of the Enterasys Web IPS, eEye's SecureIIS, and improvements in Microsoft IIS 6.0, IPAAR squarely concentrates on open source products.  Nevertheless, the book does a better job covering so-called prevention solutions than the previous book with 'prevention' in the title, e.g., Osborne's 'Intrusion Detection and Prevention.'<br /><br />Without doubt the best part of IPAAR is chapter 6, 'Protecting Your Host Through the Operating System.'  This chapter explains memory operations and ways to protect memory contents.  The author, probably Graham Clark of Enterasys, mentions both Windows and Linux memory management.  He uses a sample C program and a custom Metasploit exploit to demonstrate buffer overflows.  Using GDB he shows how the exploit affects a target and then describes multiple ways to mitigate these attacks.<br /><br />I also enjoyed chapter 5, 'Network Inline Data Modification.'  The author makes creative use of Tcpdump traces to explain how Netfilter string replacement and Snort_inline protect vulnerable services.  His justification of this defensive strategy is tempered by a good discussion of the pros and cons of inline data modification.  Chapter 8 also skillfully leverages Tcpdump traces to show network IPS in action.<br /><br />I did not have major problems with IPAAR, aside from the lack of even a mention of almost all commercial intrusion prevention products.  This is a deficiency because it is tough to find unbiased discussions of the capabilities of network- and host-based IPSs.  On the technical front, chapter 8 presented several slight TCP sequence number problems.  On p. 317 we see packets with 'ack 358'; this means bytes of data relatively numbered 1 to 357 have been received, and the next byte of expected data is relative number 358.  The client did not receive 'all data ending at server sequence number 358,' as stated on p. 319 and elsewhere; 'ack 358' means it received 1 through 357 and is awaiting 358.<br /><br />I found it silly to call the application layer on p. 258 'layer 5' instead of layer 7, the universally recognized way to refer to the services available to applications.  I also laughed at this statement on p. 37: 'Many widely deployed mainstream products deviate from the protocol specifications.  Hopefully, new packet inspection devices that check for protocol compliance will force these vendors to update and correct any noncompliance with protocol standards.'  Sorry, any IPS component that complains about business-critical application protocols will end up turned off.  Security vendors always lose the battle with application vendors!<br /><br />In places IPAAR demonstrates a serious understanding of the limitations of so-called 'intrusion prevention systems,' which when network-based are really layer 7 firewalls.  For example, p. 75 states 'the fundamental problem with this technology is that in order to prevent an attack, it first has to be detected.  Hence, it is no surprise that the detection mechanisms employed by both active response and IPSs are borrowed from IDSs, and therefore subject to the same limitations.'  This is the fact Gartner conveniently overlooked when it pushed 'firewalls with deep packet inspection' ahead of IDSs in 2003.<br /><br />I recommend reading IPAAR if you are considering deploying open source layer 7 firewalls (aka 'IPSs') or want to augment host-based defenses.  There are few reasons not to try running a product like ModSecurity on an Apache Web server, and it helps to understand new anti-overflow features in the latest Fedora and Red Hat Linux releases.  Keep in mind most of the host-based open source solutions in IPAAR are Linux-specific, in a world where Windows is the target of the day.  If you need help evaluating IPS for Windows,  IPAAR won't be able to specifically help you.'IPSs') or want to augment host-based defenses.

Panos Lekkas' work seemed like the only book available that presented a broad, multi-vendor sweep of the network processor landscape.  While the book has plenty of information to offer, I found it did not really live up to my expectations.<br /><br />Network processors are specialized computing chips built for high performance packet processing applications.  I hoped 'Network Processors' would spend a good amount of time making the case for this technology, explaining why NPs are indispensable compared to general purpose CPUs.  Unfortunately, I felt the book did not make a compelling case.  Chapter 2, titled 'Network Processors: Justification,' is only 10 pages, with a single chart graphing bandwidth demand vs time.  I would have liked to see head-to-head comparisons of NPs against CPUs for various network applications.  The book spends a lot of time discussing technologies and concepts at the periphery of NPs; I think some of that space could have been put to better use.<br /><br />Here is an example of why I felt let down by this book.  In the preface, the author seems to assure the reader that he will answer questions others tend to ignore.  On p. xix the author writes 'In numerous industry discussions, I have encountered experienced software engineers who have implemented cutting-edge protocols, but have no idea what concepts such as scheduling, backpressure, switching fabrics, and classification mean.'  To be fair, the author does explain switching fabrics and classification.  However, he says almost nothing about backpressure, and he certainly never explicitly defines it; the only mention is on p. 274.<br /><br />Elsewhere, I thought the book was unnecessarily confusing.  It's fine to cover deep technical details, but it helps to start with clear general definitions and progress to more difficult material.  The following excerpt from p. 220, the second page of chapter 12, serves as part of the 'introduction' to content addressable memory: 'The principle of associative memory is based on the inverse mechanism of establishing a relationship between the input and a specific piece of information stored in the memory array.'  This sentence is fine if the reader knows what 'associative memory' is, understands the 'inverse mechanism,' and can relate to 'the input' and a 'memory array.'<br /><br />The layout of the book itself may have contributed to my difficulty with it.  The font is one of the smallest I have ever encountered.  The footnotes are so small as to be almost illegible.  I like the hardcover binding, though.<br /><br />Although not the author's fault, readers should be aware that many of the companies and some of the technologies in 'Network Processors' have disappeared.  Each time I encountered a new company or product I checked to see if their Web page or product line still existed.  For example, IBM's PowerNP receives an entire chapter; it was sold to Hifn in January 2004.  In many cases, however, surviving vendors have not brought too many products to market since the book's late 2002 publication date.<br /><br />I believe a second edition of 'Network Processors' would benefit from an editor who challenges the author to be more organized and generous with his audience.  The book was built on a good idea -- bringing knowledge of NPs to general readers.  A second edition should ensure that goal is met, since we do need to know more about this promising technology.material.

Over two years ago I read and reviewed 'The Art of Deception,' also by Mitnick and Simon.  I thought that book was 'original, entertaining, [and] scary.'  Those same adjectives apply to 'The Art of Intrusion' (TAOI).  While I also add 'disappointing' and 'disturbing' to the description of TAOI, sections of the new book make it an absolute must-read.  If you want to understand the consequences of systematic, long-term compromise of your enterprise, you must read and heed the lessons of TAOI.<br /><br />This book may provide the closest look inside an intruder's mind the security community has yet seen.  There is simply no substitute for understanding the methodology, goals, and determination of a skilled intruder.  Chapter 8 brings the world of the enemy to life, describing separate incidents where crackers stole intellectual property from enterprise networks.  These intruders were patient and methodical, taking months to locate, acquire, and transfer their prey.  I have encountered this sort of adversary as a real security consultant (explanation follows), but never read supposed first-hand accounts from the enemy's point of view.  Chapter 8 alone makes the book worth purchasing.<br /><br />Why is the book 'disappointing' and 'disturbing' then?  I was repeatedly disgusted to read about so-called 'security consultants' who are 'published authors on security topics' (p. 168), who describe themselves as 'white-hats' but acknowledge defacing sites 'where security was so shoddy someone needed to be taught a lesson (p. 143), and who are 'respected security professionals by day and become a black-hat hacker by night, honing the skills that pay their mortgage by hacking into the most resilient software companies on the planet' (p. 166).  Attaching the label 'security professional' to these criminals -- still active by some accounts -- is a crime itself.  At least Mitnick perpetrated his crime and did his time.  These people, however skilled, are a black mark on the security community -- they literally perform the crimes for which their 'skills' are then required.  The mitigating factor for me is that these intruders shared their stories for the benefit of the community.  For that I am grateful, but I'd also like to hear they've hung up their black hats!<br /><br />In some places Mitnick seems to close to his subjects to render a fair opinion of their skills.  Chapter 5 talks about Adrian Lamo, named by Mitnick 'The Robin Hood Hacker.' It begins with a story about rescuing a kitten from a 'dirty storm drain' that belongs in an after-school TV special, and smells of social engineering on Mr. Lamo's part.  After reading about this 'purist... the thinking man's hacker,' we learn his only real skill was 'exploiting misconfigured proxy servers.'  When asked what operating system the New York Times was running when he infiltrated it via proxy server, 'Adrian answered that he doesn't know.  'I don't analyze a network that way.'  I doubt someone who 'secured' a proxy server at Excite@Home by cutting the cat 5 cable to the box knows anything more than how to use his 'favorite tool... ProxyHunter' and his 'intellectual gift of finding misconfigured proxy servers' (p. 112).  This mischaracterization of Adrian Lamo hurts the authors' credibility, at least as far as chapter 5 goes.  I felt the same sense of being too close to the characters when reading of 'two convicted murderers' in chapter 3, although their story should catch the eyes of prison wardens everywhere.<br /><br />Besides the war stories in TAOI, I found many of the authors' insights appropriate and helpful.  In places Mitnick and Simon describe how victims never believe they are compromised, and when they are shown proof, they 'figure they just dropped the ball on this one occasion' (p. 216).  Repeatedly through the book, network security monitoring is offered as a means of incident detection and response.  I wish those who advocate the supposed defender's advantage of knowing theirnetwork would read this gem on p. 164: 'I knew their network better than anyone there knew it.  If they were having problems, I could probably have fixed them.'

This book clearly exceeds the level of knowledge to pass Cisco's entry level certification.  It is aimed more at CCNPs or CCIEs who need a deeper understanding of Cisco routing.  Nevertheless, I found the book's explanations of certain subjects to be absolutely outstanding, even for a CCNA candidate.  I recommend anyone wishing to learn Cisco router operations read 'Cisco IP Routing.'<br /><br />This book seeks to deliver the 'why' as well as the 'how' of Cisco routing.  It was published in late 2001 and uses IOS 12.1 as its reference platform.  This IOS version is recent enough to meet my expectations, so don't fear that the book may not apply to more recent Cisco software and hardware.  Remember that the 2600 series router was introduced in January 1999, and the modular 2600XM series arrived only in May 2002.<br /><br />The first compelling aspect of 'Cisco IP Routing' is its exceptionally well-written and thorough explanations of various routing topics.  Although my understanding of the subject was improved by reading Todd Lammle's Sybex CCNA books, Alex Zinin's approach assisted me immensely.  For example, he helped me understand that classful addressing offers basic subnetting, which 'was used in the real world long before VLSM [Variable-Length Subnet Masks] appeared' (p. 22).  He made it clear on p. 52 that 'when multiple matching routes are available to the same destination, routers choose the longest matching route to forward the packets.'  This allows specifying a default route that is only used when more specific routes do not match a given destination.<br /><br />Beyond very insightful routing discussions, Alex makes his point using a variety of methods.  In some cases he presents tables that compare protocols.  Elsewhere he uses diagrams or figures.  Throughout the book he demonstrates syntax and configuration, along with debugging messages showing how protocols work in real life.  His innovative use of 'pseudo-code' shows how Cisco might represent protocol information within IOS itself.  In many chapters he presents and answers frequently asked questions.  These help to dispel myths readers may have concerning Cisco routers.<br /><br />I cannot complain about any real aspect of this book.  As a minor point, Alex's thorough examinations of routing packet headers should have been augmented by real packet traces.  I would like to see a companion volume introduce topics like spanning tree, BGP, and other routing and switching issues.  Readers looking for such coverage now might like Radia Perlman's 'Interconnections, 2nd Ed' and Iljitsch van Beijnum's 'BGP.'<br /><br />If you want to truly learn what your Cisco router does when it makes forwarding decisions, you must read 'Cisco IP Routing.'

US	49796397	R35SNWL4L2W3NJ	078214392X	723981791	CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate, Deluxe Edition (640-801)	Books	5	15	16	N	N	The unquestioned leader in CCNA study materials	Last week I attended Todd Lammle's CCNA class, where I received a free copy of his 'CCNA: Cisco Certified Network Associate, Deluxe Edition (640-801), 4th Ed' (CCNADE4E).  Todd's class was excellent, and his book is almost literally Todd in written form.  There is hardly a wasted word in this book.  If Todd mentions a detail concerning a protocol or a certain default value in a configuration parameter, it's important.  If he calls out that same item in a 'Note', it's definitely important.  This is not 'teaching to the test' -- it's ensuring students and readers are familiar with material Cisco considers relevant.  Cisco started its certification program to ensure administrators could properly configure and deploy its gear.  By reading CCNADE4E, you will gain that knowledge.<br /><br />Prior to attending Todd's class and reading his book, I was familiar with networking and related topics.  I did not realize that successfully passing the CCNA meant being able to answer questions rapidly, not just accurately.  This is especially important when IP subnetting and Variable Length Subnet Masks are involved.  Todd teaches a method based on 'block sizes,' or the ranges of IP addresses associated with various subnet masks.  This technique is incredibly powerful.  I used to need pencil, paper, and at least a minute to answer subnetting questions before I learned Todd's block size method.  Now I can answer the same questions in ten seconds or less (honestly).  This is not a trick; it's a different way of looking at the problem, combined with memorizing certain key information.<br /><br />Beyond innovative approaches to learning certain topics, Todd's book is also exceptionally clear.  I did not find myself wondering what he meant by a sentence, or questioning my understanding of his explanations.  This is in stark contrast to a book on TCP/IP I read and reviewed five years ago.  CCNADE4E is chock full of good diagrams, tables, and configuration and syntax examples.<br /><br />You could read only the book's text, but you would do yourself a disservice if you seek CCNA certification.  CCNADE4E provides readers with questions and labs to test their understanding.  These help CCNA candidates understand Cisco's approach to certain issues.  Some of these questions really test the reader's comprehension of internetworking.<br /><br />I found the material to be overwhelmingly accurate.  I found a few typos that I expect to see on the Sybex errata page shortly.<br /><br />If you're looking for a reference book to guide you through the CCNA testing process, look no further than CCNADE4E.  If you work through the examples, you'll also find yourself able to perform simple to moderate configuration of Cisco routers and switches.  I blew away the configurations on the gear in my lab, then rebuilt and improved them, using the knowledge I gained from this book and Todd's class.  Isn't that what certification should be about?<br />You could read only the book's text, but you would do yourself a disservice if you seek CCNA certification.

I've always been amazed by Michael's uncanny ability to include details that matter to administrators, especially in his earlier books 'Absolute BSD' and 'Absolute OpenBSD'. CRFTD is no exception; the book is chock full of life-saving Cisco tips.  I suggest you buy one to keep by your router, just as the author recommends.<br /><br />CRFTD is not supposed to be comprehensive, but it is designed to answer many if not most of the questions facing the average small router administrator.  If you're responsible for multiple routers or have complex requirements, this book is not for you.  If you are stuck sitting if front of the router connected to your ISP, and don't know how to proceed, CRFTD is for you.<br /><br />Although this book weighs in around 120 pages, it features material seldom discussed in other Cisco-related books.  For example, Michael provides good advice on how to interact with your ISP to troubleshoot connectivity issues.  He explains WAN circuits and the equipment responsibilities of ISPs and end users.  Most impressively, he dedicates 25 pages in chapter 7 to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Cisco's Host Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) -- two topics I did not expect in a book this size.  I also appreciated mention of enabling usernames and passwords (beyond the usual 'password' and 'enable' methods) and activating secure shell services.<br /><br />I like CRFTD because it cuts to the chase and tells the reader what he or she needs to know to properly configure a router.  There is not a lot of theory here, but there are some explanations.  In some cases, the syntax is not exactly in synch with Cisco's latest expectations.  For example, the company recommends using 'copy running-config startup-config' to save the running configuration to flash memory.  This does not mean Michael's syntax is wrong, but his approach may harken to an earlier time.<br /><br />The book has some minor errors which forced me to provide a four star rating.  The first issue is the lack of recommending the 'no shutdown' command when configuring interfaces.  Having just sat through a week of Todd Lammle's CCNA class, I can personally attest to the number of times router admins forget to enable interfaces.  I did not see Michael mention this -- so remember to enter 'no shutdown' when configuring interfaces.  Second, Michael mixes up the use of the console port and the AUX port; console is usually for rolled-cable access, while AUX is typically for modem access.  At the bottom of p. 31, omit the term 'netmask' from the 'ip address' command; it's not needed.  On p. 109, 'timeout' should be 'time-out' in the syntax.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed CRFTD.  I think a second edition will easily make the necessary changes.  I heartily recommend buying a copy of this book for router admins at your corporate remote locations.  They will thank you for simplifying the administration of their routers.  Those looking for a quick, hands-on CCNA refresher will find working through Michael's examples a good way to reinforce key configuration concepts.is approach may harken to an earlier time. <br /> <br />The book has some minor errors which forced me to provide a four star rating.

US	49796397	R2BF5KPCP7WGGI	0321304543	243113582	The Art of  Computer Virus Research and Defense	Books	5	52	55	N	N	One of the best technical books I've ever read	Peter Szor's 'The Art of Computer Virus Research and Defense' (TAOCVRAD) is one of the best technical books I've ever read, and I've reviewed over 150 security and networking books during the past 5 years.  This book so thoroughly owns the subject of computer viruses that I recommend any authors seeking to write their own virus book find a new topic.  Every technical computing professional needs to read this book, fast.<br /><br />I read this book from cover to cover.  The author does not lie when he says acquiring the same amount of information requires digging in obscure virus journals and analyzing malicious code.  TAOCVRAD's single most powerful aspect is the author's persistence in naming one or more sample viruses that exemplify whatever concept he is discussing.  In other words, all of his theory is backed by, or builds on, real-life examples.  Each chapter contains moderate end-notes that provide pointers for additional research.<br /><br />A truly great book has the power to change deeply-entrenched opinions, or make readers look at old problems in a new light.  In my case, I altered my perception of the virus problem and ways to fight it.  First, I changed my concept of viruses and worms.  Peter builds on Fred Cohen's virus definition to say 'a computer virus is a program that recursively and explicitly copies a possibly evolved version of itself.'  He calls worms a 'subclass of computer viruses.'  I used to disagree with Peter; I believed a virus infects files and requires user interaction, and a worm spreads by itself via the network.  Now I agree with Peter's viewpoint: 'worms are network viruses, primarily replicating on networks... If the primary vector of the virus is the network, it should be classified as a worm.'  The distinction is subtle, but it makes sense to consider worms a subclass of viruses given Peter's extensive analysis of both types of malware.<br /><br />Second, I recognized I held an opinion Peter considers unfortunate: 'some computer security people do not seem to consider computer viruses as a serious aspect of security, or they ignore the relationship between computer security and computer viruses.'  I was guilty as charged.  I used to positively detest viruses because they seemed like mindless automated code that did little but replicate.  After reading about scores of real viruses, I have a profound appreciation for virus technology.  Viruses introduced techniques for obfuscation, stealth, and exploitation a decade earlier, in some cases, than the single-shot exploit code we see today.<br /><br />Third, Peter put a human face on the problems associated with closed-source operating systems like Microsoft Windows.  Many so-called Native API calls are undocumented, and as such make life difficult for anti-virus developers.  (Virus writers tend to know them.)  With Microsoft entering the anti-virus market, will it leverage these secrets to outperform competitors lacking this internal knowledge?<br /><br />Readers of Ed Skoudis' 'Malware' or Jose Nazario's 'Defense and Detection Strategies against Internet Worms' will find this new book greatly complements those two works.  Those wishing to get the most value from TAOCVRAD should have Intel assembly coding skills and several years of hands-on security experience.<br /><br />I had almost no issues with this book, which is striking given it is nearly 700 pages long.  In a few places I found the language a little rough, but not enough to bother me.  I believe a code listing on p. 372 should show a '&lt;=' instead of '=', but I may be wrong.  Although the author works for Symantec, I did not see an undue amount of Symantec-centric material.  Chapter 13 is somewhat of an exception, but I do not fault the author.  I felt the network section (ch 14) could have been stronger, since advice to block all IP fragments or ICMP at border routers isn't necessarily wise.  I can't personally vouch for all of the author's virus analysis as his skill level exceeds mine by an order of magnitude.<br /><br />TAOCVRAD is the must-buy security book of 2005.  You could spend weeks learning from this book.  Readers should be thankful Peter decided to share so much of his knowledge with us in an accessible and educational format.l level exceeds mine by an order of magnitude. <br /> <br />TAOCVRAD is the must-buy security book of 2005.

I am always looking for good networking books to recommend to people asking how to enter the digital security field.  I am pleased to report that CN:IPIA is an excellent, hands-on, packet-oriented introduction to networking, suitable for all entry-level analysts.  Even those with several years of experience may learn a trick or two, as I did.<br /><br />The book is very logically organized.  Section 1 is an introduction to using Ethereal to collect and inspect packets.  I was unaware of Ethereal's ability to color packets based on user-specified 'color rules'.  Section 1 also describes the various Ethereal panes and what they mean.<br /><br />Section 2 starts the hands-on packet analysis work.  The CD accompanying the book offers 30 MB of packet traces collected by the author.  She uses these traces to expertly illustrate a variety of networking concepts.  Section 2 introduces the top of the protocol stack by looking at application protocols.  I learned about HTTP Last-Modified, If-Modified-Since, Cache-Control, and ETag headers.<br /><br />Section 3 discusses transport layer protocols like TCP and UDP.  I really liked the author's exposition on TCP Selective Acknowledgement (SACK), and I was glad to see she fully understood and explained TCP sequence numbers.  I also finally grapsed the idea behind TCP time sequence graphs by reading this part.<br /><br />Section 4 covered network layer protocols.  After fairly standard material on DHCP, ping, and traceroute, I was surprised and pleased to read about routing protocols.  Both interior protocols  (RIP and OSPF) and an exterior protocol (BGP) made appearances.  Better yet, analysts can examine traffic traces to understand how these protocols work.<br /><br />Section 5 talked about link-level protocols (wired and wireless), and section 6 concludes the book with a few examples of security-related network events.<br /><br />My few problems with CN:IPIA are overshadowed by the excellent material elsewhere.  On p. 79 the author writes that a mail server involved in exchanging a message is the system which makes a DNS query.  In fact, the trace shows it's the mail client, a laptop, making the query.  Since the mail server in the example is also the sample network's DNS server, any query it makes would be answered by itself -- and wouldn't appear on the wire.  On p. 109, in the second paragraph, the last two references to 'packet 7' should be 'packet 6'.  I also think readers should have seen an example of active FTP to complement the book's discussion of passive FTP.<br /><br />If you're looking to gain a packet-oriented understanding of networking, you must buy this book.  It's a fast read, but I have not seen a better hands-on introduction to network traffic.

'Information leakage' refers to the unintentional disclosure of sensitive information to public forums, like the Web.  Security staff can use the tools and techniques outlined in Johnny Long's GHFPT to assess the degree of information leakage affecting their organizations.  They can then propose, implement, and test remedies.  When Google says they are clean, they can be reasonably assured they are.<br /><br />'Google hacking' is popular because the results are so unambiguous.  If you can locate a sensitive configuration file, mail box, registry key, etc., using Google, so can an intruder.  GHFPT thoroughly documents multiple ways to find an incredible range of sensitive information using Web searches.  Johnny Long takes care not to document how to find Social Security numbers or credit cards, although details on doing so have been posted on the Web.<br /><br />While companies have performed corporate espionage or collected 'business intelligence' against each other, I wonder how many direct their gaze inwards.  Armed with GHFPT, a security administrator should know how to search and secure his organization's Web site.  The book explains tools like Sensepost's Wikto, which automate Google-based reconnaissance and use the Google query API.  Those who wish to write their own Google query tools will like James Foster's excellent chapter 12.  There he demonstrates four implementations, in Perl, Python, C#, and C.<br /><br />GHFPT concludes with two appendices.  The first, by Pete Herzog, outlines professional penetration testing with respect to the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual.  The second, by Matt Fisher, is a brief discussion of Web application security.  Readers who want to know more about the latter subject will enjoy 'Hacking Exposed: Web Applications' by Scambray and Shema; 'Hack Proofing Your E-Commerce Site,' by Russel, et al; and 'Hack Proofing Your Web Applications,' by Forristal.  While those books are several years old, they are thorough and still relevant.<br /><br />When you hire your next penetration testing team, be sure to ask if they offer Google assessment services.  I see this as the next step in application reconnaissance.  I also highly recommend all security staff read GHFPT.  You are responsible now if an intruder compromises your Web server via an application attack.  You will soon find yourself responsible if an intruder queries Google and discovers an exposed password file that yields the same level of access.

IDOS combines sound advice with a fairly complete examination of the denial of service (DoS) problem set.  Although the authors write from the DoS point of view, as a network security monitoring advocate I found myself agreeing with many of their insights.  Since there are no other books dedicated to DoS, I was very pleased to find this one is a powerful resource for managers and technicians alike.<br /><br />IDOS features some of the best minds on DoS research available.  Everyone has heard of Dave Dittrich, but I found the work of lead author Jelena Mirkovic to be particularly valuable.  Peter Reiher and long-time DoS researcher Sven Dietrich also give the project considerable weight.  All four authors work for or with universities, and IDOS reflects this academic connection by frequently citing papers and DoS research.  For example, chapter 7 describe DoS mitigation approaches and Appendix C examines the best available data on DoS techniques.  I would encourage other authors to make similar references to the academic community and not write in a literary vacuum.<br /><br />By making references to outside works, IDOS successfully avoids repeating material published elsewhere.  Chapter 6 was probably my favorite section, including much distilled wisdom and advice on responding to DoS attacks.  I welcomed the authors' frequent recommendations to collect session and full content data.  It is often impossible to detect and respond to attacks without this sort of network-based evidence.  This point is often lost on vendors or consultants who lack experience performing incident response.<br /><br />I had minor problems with the book.  First, I would have liked more technical detail in chapter 6.  For example, it would have been nice to see examples of system metrics from nodes or routers under DoS attack.  Specific advice on host tuning techniques would also have been useful, e.g., make changes X, Y, or Z on FreeBSD or Cisco IOS to better resist DoS conditions.  I was also slightly disappointed the authors did not base their discussions of commercial products in Appendix B on hands-on evaluations.  I understand the problem with meeting this objective, however.<br /><br />I did not have any problems with the legal or concluding chapters (8 & 9).  I think the earlier three-star reviewer found himself on the wrong side of the 1999 \\"RST scan\\" controversy discussed on p. 52 and may not have been happy by the (correct) stance taken by IDOS.<br /><br />I highly recommend every security professional read IDOS.  It's a convenient and illuminating discussion of a problem that will never disappear.  This book will prepare you to do battle with DoS attacks, and for that I am thankful.hanges X, Y, or Z on FreeBSD or Cisco IOS to better resist DoS conditions.

US	49796397	RDRNTT85ZQ98Z	020163497X	561458846	Forensic Discovery	Books	5	14	17	N	N	A focused look at digital forensics by two pioneers	Farmer and Venema do for digital archaeology what Indiana Jones did for historical archaeology. 'Forensic Discovery' unearths hidden treasures in enlightening and entertaining ways, showing how a time-centric approach to computer forensics reveals even the cleverest intruder.  I highly recommend reading this book.<br /><br />I appreciate books that don't rehash previously published material.  Plenty of authors have written books with the word 'forensics' in the title, and many impart little or no useful or original information.  (Exceptions include this book, along with Mandia and Prosise's 'Incident Response and Computer Forensics, 2nd Ed' and Jones' 'Real Digital Forensics,' forthcoming.)  While 'Forensic Discovery' discusses concepts familiar to kernel developers or others with low-level operating system knowledge, the book is useful because it places such details in the concept of a security investigation.<br /><br />'Forensic Discovery' is exactly the sort of forensic book I enjoy, because it is primarily concerned with intrusions.  Broadly speaking, there are two types of 'forensic investigators:' those that know how to image a hard drive and search for pornography, and those that know how to respond to and investigate an intrusion.  Farmer and Venema are clearly in the second category, and their examples focus on intrusion scenarios rather than workplace misuse of the Internet.  Their statement regarding the conservative approach advocated by the US DoJ on p. 195 makes their stance clear.<br /><br />Chapters 6 and 8 were two of my favorites.  Ch 6 discusses virtual machines, system call and library monitoring, and debugging.  The authors also show the relationship between disassembled code and decompiled C source code.  Ch 8 offers a solid introduction to virtual memory managers.  Throughout the book Farmer and Venema give command equivalents for Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris.  Windows makes infrequent appearances,, although ch 8 presents a Windows memory dump case.<br /><br />'Forensic Discovery' is unique in that many of the author's conclusions are based on their own experiments.

The authors leave their definition of 'gray hat' unresolved until ch 3, where they claim that a 'white hat' is a person who 'uncovers a vulnerability and exploits it with authorization;' a 'black hat' is one who 'uncovers a vulnerability and illegally exploits it and/or tells others how to;' and a 'gray hat' is one who 'uncovers a vulnerability, does not illegally exploit it or tell others how to do it, but works with the vendor.'  I disagree and prefer SearchSecurity.com's definitions, where white hats find vulnerabilities and tell vendors without providing public exploit code; black hats find vulnerabilities, code exploits, and maliciously attack victims; and gray hats find vulnerabilities, publish exploits, but do not illegally use them.  According to these more common definitions, the book should have been called 'White Hat Hacking.' I doubt it would sell as well with that title!<br /><br />Content-wise, the book mixes ethical and legal advice with tool overviews and technical information.  Many reviewers note the good legal overview in ch 3, where I found the tables summarizing various laws to be helpful.  The authors provide a sound rationale for penetration testing: 'Nothing should be trusted until it is tested' (p. 13).  I enjoyed the disclosure discussion in ch 3 as well.  I liked the brief tool descriptions of Core IMPACT, Immunity Security's CANVAS, and the Metasploit Framework.  Some of the other discussions (e.g., Amap, P0f, Ettercap) didn't go deeper than already published explanations of those same tools.<br /><br />I found the technical material to be accurate albeit somewhat disorganized and in some cases far too shallow.  For example, the authors provide 6 pages on Python (ch 6), 6 pages on C (ch 7), and a single 21 page chapter (ch 10) mentioning system calls, socket programming, and assembly language.  On p 279 and several other places the authors admit their topic 'deserves a chapter to itself, if not an entire book!'  They should have trusted their instincts and required readers to have prior knowledge of programming in low- and high-level languages prior to reading GHH.  Instead, short sections that are too basic for the pros but too rushed for beginners detract from the book's focus.<br /><br />The five authors clearly know their subjects, but they should have coordinated their chapters better.  For example, ch 7 introduces using debuggers without even a description of their purpose.  Six chapters later (in ch 13), we read a description of debugging only to be followed again by another discussion of debugging in ch 14.  All of this should have been consolidated and rationalized.<br /><br />I think McGraw-Hill/Osborne's second edition of GHH should seek to differentiate itself from more focused books like 'The Shellcoder's Handbook' (by Wiley) and 'Exploiting Software' (by Addison-Wesley).  There is a market for high-end security books without sparse introductory material included for the benefit of beginners.  Authors should either commit to the beginners and give enough information to enlighten them, or tell them to read foundational references first and concentrate on the more experienced audience.  Authors like Allen Harper and Chris Eagle, winners of last year's 'Capture the Flag' contest at Def Con, can deliver the goods if not constrained by a publisher's desire to address as broad an audience as possible.

US	49796397	R1Y9P2CRR48V1H	020172152X	696822688	Building Secure Software: How to Avoid Security Problems the Right Way	Books	5	13	18	N	N	The book that launched a new security genre	'Building Secure Software' (BSS) is an excellent book.  I can't believe it was published in the fall of 2001, and I've only gotten to it now.  Negative reviewers should remember that a single book can't address every security topic under the sun.  BSS is the first of several titles by authors Viega and McGraw; those looking for additional details can peruse their later books.<br /><br />BSS has three overall strengths which merit a five star review.  First, the book contains the distilled wisdom of its two authors.  We are lucky to have two developers-turned-security-experts sharing their insights with us.  They explain many concepts in plain language suitable for coders and non-coders alike.  I especially enjoyed their ten guiding principles of ch 5 and the auditing software advice of ch 6.  In other sections, like ch 4, they argue that 'open source' does not equal 'secure.'  In ch 2 the authors explain the importance of system specifications, i.e., how is a system expected to act under a given situation?  These sorts of insights are useful for managers as well as developers.<br /><br />Second, BSS backs up its recommendations with real code examples.  The authors don't just tell you what to do -- they show you.  In many cases they begin with a 'naive' implementation fraught with errors, which they then incrementally improve.  The password material in ch 13 is an example of this technique.  A related benefit of the book was its description of attack trees in ch 6, which I find helpful.<br /><br />Third, the authors very thoroughly discuss topics mentioned in other books, but not backed up in those titles by code samples.  For example, ch 7 has a very detailed buffer overflow explanation.  If you want to follow actual code and memory locations to understand how to write a buffer overflow exploit, ch 7 will explain how to do it.<br /><br />BSS's errata doesn't seem to be available at the defunct book Web site, although I was able to retrieve it via the Internet Archive.  My main concern with the book's content was the replacement of the security principle of 'availability' by another principle, 'authentication.'  In other words, when one mentions 'the big three security goals,' (p. 22) they are 'confidentiality,' 'integrity,' and 'availability,' not 'authentication.'<br /><br />I didn't find the relative lack of Windows-specific material to be a problem.  The book's errata addresses some of the negative reviewers' concerns.  Several years after its initial publication, BSS is still a timely and relevant read that I recommend to all developers and security professionals.rnet Archive.

US	49796397	RFHYK7Q76H09H	8391665119	141952379	Building Firewalls with Openbsd and Pf, 2nd Edition	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Excellent hands-on guide to Pf on OpenBSD or other BSDs	I was an early buyer of the first edition of 'Building Firewalls with OpenBSD and PF' (BFWOAP), but I am confident my opinion applies to the second edition as well.  BFWOAP is the perfect book for anyone looking to build an firewall with Pf.  Since Pf is now part of FreeBSD, NetBSD, and DragonFly BSD, this book will be helpful to anyone looking to use Pf on those platforms.<br /><br />I like the direct approach taken by author Jacek Artymiak.  With few exceptions he ensures the reader is provided enough descriptions and working examples to implement Pf in an operational environment.  Too often authors discuss important topics but fail to follow through on implementation.  I was able to follow the author's instructions and build a variety of Pf firewalls.  I found sections describing packet normalization, packet redirection and forwarding (via 'dup-to'), and prioritization to be most helpful.<br /><br />The author's blog indicates he is working on a new firewall book that expands beyond OpenBSD and Pf.  I hope he is working with an established publisher to ensure his next book has a wider audience.<br /><br />If you're mainly interested in creating firewalls using Pf, this book is for you.  If you want to know more about OpenBSD, I recommend Michael Lucas' 'Absolute OpenBSD' or 'Secure Architectures with OpenBSD' by Brandon Palmer and Jose Nazario.	2004-12-30
US	49796397	R12FYG0ZNRVWJ1	032124656X	155815899	The Unabridged Pentium 4: IA32 Processor Genealogy	Books	4	17	18	N	N	Value depends on accepting the book's purpose	Page 1 of 'The Unabridged Pentium 4' (TUP4) claims 'there is real value in understanding how the architecture has grown over the years,' where the 'architecture' is the IA-32 register set, instruction set, and software exceptions.  If you accept this premise, you will find TUP4 to be a valuable book.  If you are looking for detail on the lowest-level of programming on IA-32, you should download Intel's free IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer s Manual.<br /><br />Readers looking for information on IA-32 architecture can first turn to three free books Intel provides in .pdf format: Volume 1: Basic Architecture (448 pp); Volumes 2A (580 pp) & 2B (416 pp): Instruction Set Reference; and Volume 3: System Programming Guide (838 pp), for a total of 2282 pp.  Volume 1 describes the basic architecture and programming environment of an IA-32 processor.  Volumes 2A & 2B are aimed at application programmers and describe the instruction set of the processor and the opcode structure. Volume 3, for OS engineers and BIOS designers, describes the OS support environment of an IA-32 processor and IA-32 processor compatibility information.<br /><br />TUP4 differs from these volumes in that TUP4 describes Intel processors from a historical and evolutionary standpoint.  Although TUP4 has 'Pentium 4' in its title, it begins with the 386 CPU and even makes comparison to 286 and prior CPUs.  TUP4 'builds' the P4 by beginning with the 386 and adding features over time.  I found this approach helpful to explain why Intel has ended up with the architecture in the P4.<br /><br />The book's descriptions tend to be thorough and detailed.  For example, there are explanations of the state of every element of a CPU upon a system reset, bit-oriented descriptions of registers and memory structures, and electrical characteristics of components like the Front Side Bus.<br /><br />TUP4 is also interesting because the author is not an Intel employee.  This leaves him free to mention items like the fact that the original (and presumably existing) Pentium M CPU is based on the PIII core, and not the newer P4.<br /><br />Reader should not ignore the additional 342 pages found on the book's CD-ROM.  I found the first three chapters most interesting, as they describe processor problems and solutions (ch 1), register (ch 2) and instruction set (ch 3) evolution; the remainder covers aspects of the P6 core.<br /><br />I have a few concerns with TUP4.  First, the quality of most of the figures and diagrams needs to be improved.  While legible, they look like they were pulled from slides used in the author's classes, and did not survive publication at high resolution.  Second, I think the book could have been thinner.  While not exactly a 'large font' book, I saw too much white space and repetition of material.  The book had 89 pages (lxxxix) of introduction to handle the table of contents, etc!  Third and most importantly, I did not get enough of an introduction to certain CPU concepts and elements.  In a 1600+ page book, I would have put more tables and similar references on the CD-ROM, and more basic CPU hardware explanation in the text.<br /><br />While I am not technically proficient enough in CPU design to critique the book's content, I found one remark odd.  On p 209 the author states that a hypothetical system with 256 MB RAM would be 'ridiculously small,' and that it would be 'amazing' if an OS would occupy 250 MB or memory or less.  Most consumer PCs ship with 128 MB RAM (admittedly too little in my opinion), so 256 MB is a good standard for modern Windows systems.  I am not sure why the author selected his figures, for they do not seem representative of modern computing.<br /><br />Overall, I strongly recommend anyone wanting to learn more about the IA-32 architecture first download and peruse Intel's three volumes.  I am fairly sure those documents will answer your questions.  If you want a more comparative discussion, with the 386, 486, Pentium, and later processors explained, give TUP4 a look.  For future editions, I would pare the book down by moving more reference material to the CD-ROM, and call the book 'Abridged.'6, Pentium, and later processors explained, give TUP4 a look.

US	49796397	R2BHDQPAGHBB67	0750659890	946029907	Introduction to Microprocessors and Microcontrollers	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Not enough of an update, but still excellent	I reviewed the 1998 edition of this book, 'Introduction to Microprocessors,' (ITM) about a year ago.  I gave that book five stars for bringing the internal workings of CPUs within the reach of the computer layman.  This new 2004 edition, 'Introduction to Microprocessors and Microcontrollers,' (ITMAM) isn't quite the update I expected, but it's still a great book.<br /><br />The major differences between ITM and ITMAM involve a few sections.  First, material on the Alpha 21164 microprocessor is replaced by a discussion of the AMD Athlon XP.  Second, two chapters on microcontrollers are added.  Author John Crisp defines a microcontroller as essentially a microprocessor with some ROM and RAM on a single chip.  Third, Crisp briefly discusses the innards of popular game consoles in ch 11.  Finally, a short discussion of writing assembly language adds another layer to the new edition.<br /><br />My expectations for ITMAM drove my four star rating.  The older ITM book was a product of its late 1990s heritage, with the Pentium II processor described as Intel's latest offering.  Unfortunately, I see many of the same references in the newer ITMAM book.  On p 174, for example, we read about 'rumours of the Pentium II running at 400 MHz.'  Although newer products, like the PIV, appear, I got the sense that the update process was not very thorough.<br /><br />The microcontroller material was a welcome addition to ITMAM, but in the future the author might want to look at products by other manufacturers.  There seems to be a vigorous community built around the Atmel AVR microcontroller, supported by plenty of open source programming tools and references.  Overall, I still recommend reading the second edition of this book.  I hope to see the third edition be a more thorough upgrade, perhaps with coverage of embedded technology and network processors?	2004-12-26

When I started, I simply read and flipped pages, thinking I wouldn't find much of deep importance.  After about 20 pages I was extremely interested in the book and started underlining the author's main points.  By chapter 5, and especially in chapter 6, the author lost my attention and I ended up giving this book a three star review.<br /><br />The valuable core of 'The Hacker Ethic' lies in its comparison with the Protestant work ethic.  The author explains that philosophy's roots in monastic life, and contrasts it with the 'hacker ethic' and its roots in academic/scientific practices.  As a history major I thought this comparison was fascinating and it made me examine my own work habits more closely.  The author's illumination of time-centric vs. task-centric work was especially interesting.<br /><br />Linux kernel inventor Linus Torvalds wrote the prologue, so the entire book approaches the free/open software world from an overtly Linux perspective.  One mention of BSD appears in a citation of Eric S. Raymond's 'Cathedral and the Bazaar.'  ESR criticizes the BSD development model ('carefully coordinated... by a relatively small, tightly knit group of people') in comparison with Linux, where 'quality was maintained not by rigid standards or autocracy but by the naively simple strategy of releasing every week and getting feedback.'  I think 'naive' is the operative word here.  Linux has certainly prospered, but companies like IBM, Novell, and others are playing increasingly bigger roles.<br /><br />If you can read Linus' prologue and the first four chapters in a book store, I recommend doing so.  I believe the author does a nice job making comparisons with the Protestant work ethic, but doesn't quite know where to go next.  Reading four chapters should take a couple of hours, and you'll walk away appreciating the keen insights author Pekka Himanen has to offer on 'The Hacker Ethic.'r Ethic.'	2004-12-20

However, we need more works like Mike Schiffman's 'Building Open Source Network Security Tools' (BOSNST).  I regret having waited so long to read BOSNST, but I'm glad I did.  Schiffman's book is for people who want to build, not break, software, and the way he describes how to create tools is enlightening.<br /><br />The major theme I captured from BOSNST was the importance of creating useful code libraries.  Six of the book's 12 chapters focus on libraries which provide functions for application programmers.  While not all have gained the same amount of fame or use, the author's approach remains sound.  Libraries are the building blocks around which numerous tools can and should be built.<br /><br />This theme helped me understand the evolution of RFP's Whisker CGI scanner, released in Oct 1999 and deprecated in May 2003.  Whisker lives on as a library, Libwhisker, in the Nikto Web server scanner.  Similarly, Schiffman's chapter on Libsf mentions the utility of creating a library offering the functionality of the popular Nmap scanning tool.  (Unfortunately, I haven't seen progress on this.  Nmap author Fyodor last mentioned 'Libnmap' in his 2003 Nmap features survey, and it's not apparent in the tool's latest version.)<br /><br />I found the six library chapters to be helpful.  Some of the code has stagnated since 2002 (Libnids, Libsf), while some has continued to evolve (Libpcap, Libdnet, OpenSSL).  Schiffman provides good explanations of buffer overflow and format string attacks in ch 10, and I thought his state machine-based port scan detector (Descry) in ch 11 was innovative.<br /><br />One of the strongest sections of BOSNST is ch 12, where the author provides a 25-page code walkthrough of his Firewalk tool.  This chapter is the model for anyone seeking to explain tool internals.  Schiffman offers flowcharts, context charts, and explanations of code snippets.  He doesn't simply dump page after page of C code in front of the reader.  (Most chapters of BOSNST do conclude with the full source code for sample tools, however.)<br /><br />I have no real complaints with BOSNST.  I found minor errors in two diagrams (p 220, 223 should show the SYN/ACK or RST reply coming from the target, not to the target).  Schiffman's writing style is clear and engaging, which makes a difference when explaining functions in code.<br /><br />Those who want to learn how to assemble their security expertise in the form code libraries should read BOSNST.  Those who wish to use the libraries found in the book, or those with similar functionality, should also read BOSNST.  I look forward to Schiffman's next book, where hopefully he will finally update his biography to say 'AFIWC' (for 'Air Force Information Warfare Center') instead of 'AFWIC' (aka the UN's 'AFrican Women In Crisis' program).anations of code snippets.

Now that I've bought and read it, I'm glad this book caught my eye.  Although EFC is somewhat dated by its use of FreeBSD 4.4 (released Sep 01), I learned more about about FreeBSD internals.  I also gained insights into what is needed to create an embedded appliance from the ground up.<br /><br />EFC describes how the Measurement Computing company used FreeBSD 4.4 to create their Digital Input-Output (DIO) server appliance,  built on a Network Engines 'Roadster' platform.  The author explains the advantages of embedded systems and why it makes sense to construct them using open source software.  He also defends the use of BSD-licensed software to build the DIO.<br /><br />The best aspect of the book was its direct nature and breadth of coverage.  EFC addresses many topics in a clear and concise manner, including processes, daemons, system calls, and library usage.  I found this direct and efficient approach a good way to become familiar with subjects covered in much greater depth by books like McKusick and Neville-Neil's 'The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System.'<br /><br />On the downside, for a reader on the eve of 2005, the book is dated in several respects.  EFC's use of FreeBSD 4.x means some of its material no longer applies to FreeBSD 5.x.  For example, 5.x uses DEVFS in place of manual device node creation.  System source code (like the cdevsw structure in bus_private.h) is often much different.  Some code, like ch 2's explanation of forking, works on 4.x but not 5.x.  The use of the Java JDK version 1.1.8 really dates the book, as well.  Finally, several typos change the meaning of parts of the text.  For example, p. 30 appears to show 'gcc -00' (two zeroes) when I believe it should be 'gcc -O0' (capital O, zero) to disable compiler optimizations.  Below on the same page, objdump should be passed the '--disassemble' or the '-d' switch, not '-disassemble'.<br /><br />Overall, I still liked reading EFC.  The book gave me plenty to consider, should I ever want to deploy an embedded appliance.  Companies like St Bernard do use FreeBSD in their appliances, so perhaps an update by one of their developers would be in order?be passed the '--disassemble' or the '-d' switch, not '-disassemble'. <br /> <br />Overall, I still liked reading EFC.

ITSC exposes spam from the point of view of the 'enemy' -- a spammer who claims 'you need to be ruthless in this industry if you want to make any money at it' (p. 132).  This book is an absolute must-read for anyone trying to combat spam, especially policy makers who think passing laws with clever names makes any difference.<br /><br />ITSC's value derives from the authenticity of the author(s).  I suspect that a lead author may have received assistance from contributors, all of whom are spammers, or in one case, a 'reformed-spammer-cum-system-administrator' (p. 320).  Some parts of the book hint at a British author (see references to 'parliament' and 'headmasters') while others hint at a New Yorker (see stories of conversing with passers-by in the city, or buying expensive goods on 5th Avenue).  ITSC pulls no punches and gives enough detail to make any semi-technically savvy user a future spammer.  Just as the Anonymous author of 1997's 'Maximum Security' brought 'hacking' to the masses, Spammer-X brings spamming to a world that only sees spam in in-boxes, not the method by which spam is sent.<br /><br />I found ITSC's discussion of tools and techniques enlightening.  Readers will learn about programs to generate and transmit spam.  They are advisted to host images at overseas 'bullet-proof' Web hosts.  Spammer-X explains how to manipulate message content for maximum effect, how to receive referrals fees from sites selling products, and how to collect payment via sometimes shady means.  The spam case studies in ch 11 were excellent, and the charts showing 'revenue vs. products sold' in ch 6 showed the author(s) treat spamming as a true business.<br /><br />The only flaws I found involved rough copy-editing and reporting  a bogus story involving RFID chips in US $20 bills.  I was  disturbed to hear spammers defend their need to break into servers to steal/trade/sell email addresses.  I was also appalled by their practice of turning innocent home users into bot net participants and spam proxy servers as part of 'the perfect spam' (ch 11).  Spamming of that sort is not an 'art form' which transmits 'masterpieces' (p. 369); it is the end result of illegal and destructive intrusions that prey on weaker elements of digital society.  Marketing is fine; unauthorized access is wrong.<br /><br />The author(s) barely mention the best way to mitigate spam (probably because it will work): changing the financial equation.  Once users charge senders before accepting their mail (and then refunding legitimate senders), spamming will be too expensive.  Until that micro-payment infrastructure is in place, I recommend we all read and heed Spammer-X's fascinating work.d their need to break into servers to steal/trade/sell email addresses.

I recommend all security professionals read this book.  You may start as a Nessus user, but the book will help you become part of the Nessus community.<br /><br />NNA features twelve contributors, but it doesn't suffer the fate of other books with similar high author counts.  NNA manages to present fairly original material in each chapter, without a lot of overlap.  I credit the lead authors and editors for keeping the contributors on track.  They could have reduced the number of crashing printer stories, however.<br /><br />Several chapters stood out from the others.  Ch 1 explains the need for conducting vulnerability assessment.  Ch 3 makes a good case for always installing from source code and not trusting precompiled binaries.  Chs 8 and 9 deliver real value with insights into Nessus internals, such as scanning architecture and the Nessus Knowledge Base.  Ch 10 presents crude albeit workable ways to measure bandwidth to alleviate loads caused by scans.  Ch 11 is an excellent rationale for the Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL) written by Nessus' creator.  I would have liked to have seen an appendix based on an actual (perhaps sanitized) scan, showing how a security admin selected tests, ran the scan, and validated results.<br /><br />NNA suffers a few problems.  A few typos are present, but nothing that distracts from the book's content.  I did find the ch 4 author's mention of the TCP \\"triple handshake\\" to be odd.  While not wrong, this process is usually called the \\"three-way handshake.\\"  The screenshots in appendix B are of poor quality and should be replaced in future editions.<br /><br />Note that the Nessus version used in NNA varies from 2.0.9 to 2.0.10a, and the current edition is 2.2.0.  Version creep is part of every technical book, and did not make a big difference at this point.  When Nessus 2.4 is released, watch for the adoption of the new BOSS GUI to clearly alter the face of the Nessus interface.<br /><br />Overall, NNA is an excellent technical resource for anyone charged with auditing network security.  I have a greater appreciation for the Nessus architecture and its ability to do more in-depth host checks.  Motivated readers can use this book to learn how to write their own NASL scripts and effectively deploy a distributed scanning architecture.atch for the adoption of the new BOSS GUI to clearly alter the face of the Nessus interface. <br /> <br />Overall, NNA is an excellent technical resource for anyone charged with auditing network security.

While HTOAC is fictional and written almost exclusively from the point of view of the 'hacker,' HTCR is mostly true and written from the law enforcement perspective.  On the strength of the cases described in the first half of the book, I recommend HTCR as an introduction to the mindset needed to pursue and prosecute cyber criminals.<br /><br />Author Steve Branigan brings a unique perspective to his book.  In 1986-7 Branigan was a patrolman in the Seaside Heights Police Department, but three years later he investigated telecom incidents for Bell Communications Research.  Later work at Lucent and Bell Labs prepared him for co-founding Lumeta in 2000.  His experience with telecom security differentiates the book from those who spend more time on Internet-centric crimes.<br /><br />I found the first half of the book more helpful than the second half, particularly when legal and criminal concepts are introduced in the context of security investigations.  Ch 1 offers insight into drafting search warrants when pursuing a rogue insider.  Ch 2 explains subpoenas and executing search warrants.  Ch 3 discusses options at trial, like plea bargains.  Ch 4 outlines an undercover sting and the role of confidential informants.  Ch 5 talks about identity theft and ch 6 describes the author's role in interviewing two 'hackers.'<br /><br />The first half of the book uses true stories to make its points, but the second shifts more to opinions with short stories added for interest.  I skimmed these later chapters as they seemed more appropriate for those without security and forensic experience.<br /><br />A few excerpts from the book are quote worthy.  On p 106 Branigan notes that during a sting operation, the cops disabled exploit tools hosted on a cop-supervised bulletin board to avoid 'facilitating the transmission of hacking tools.'  Consider that when you find a 'broken exploit.'  A footnote on p 111 says 'NetStumbler is freeware.  Why people write these things nobody knows.'  NetStumbler isn't just for wardriving by those with malicious intent; sys admins also use it to discover rogue access points.<br /><br />I agree with Thomas Duff's assessment regarding the shelf life of Branigan's stories.  Many cases, like ch 1's SS7 intrusion, were cool despite being almost 10 years old.  In other places Branigan really dated himself.  For example, p 118 states 'the main set of backdoor programs for UNIX are collectively known as rootkit, and those for Windows-based systems are Back Orifice and Netbus.'  That was mostly correct in 2000, but very dated by 2004.  I also question the 'session takeover' techniques mentioned on p 175; far too little detail is offered to make me accept this 'magic' capability.<br /><br />Overall I recommend reading HTCR.  Branigan literally has a front-row seat on several fascinating security incidents.  Few people have accompanied police when seizing evidence or performed hands-on analysis of live systems as related by HTCR.  Readers with an interest in telco security will particularly enjoy Branigan's tales, and I appreciated his use of FreeBSD as a forensic platform.hen you find a 'broken exploit.'

Rather than hire a Beltway Bandit, I recommend those planning the digital defense of this nation read HTOAC.  This book is more creative, comprehensive, and plausible than what most 'infowar' think-tanks could produce.<br /><br />HTOAC is second in the STN series, which is developing into an entertaining and effective way to train security professionals.  I was a little worried that such a large team of authors would not be able to create a cohesive book.  It's easier to assemble the series of vignettes in the original 'Stealing the Network: How to Own the Box' than it is to tie together stories by a dozen authors.  While the editing is rough is some places, the storyline explained each individual's part in the caper fairly well.  Although the end of the book hints at a certain conclusion, I would have enjoyed a more definitive epilogue, perhaps written from the law enforcement perspective.<br /><br />The strength of HTOAC derives from the expertise of its authors.  I've never seen anything in print quite like Joe Grand's chapter on switch hacking.  Ryan Russell's description of Knuth's bunker buildout would put the Discovery Channel's 'Monster House' to shame.  The attention paid to leveraging unauthorized physical and wireless attacks also seemed very realistic.<br /><br />I have no major concerns with HTOAC, but I don't think it was necessary to print a log of emails exchanged during the book development process.  The text held its own at 345 pages, so 50 pages of email add no real value.  I also question the need for authors to write 5-star 'reviews' of their own books.  Authors write books, and readers write reviews.<br /><br />I look forward to the next book in the STN series.  Syngress is doing an excellent job bringing nonstandard security topics to light by tapping niche talents.  Everyone will look at their defensive posture differently after reading HTOAC; this is the authors' greatest gift to the security community.niche talents.

US	49796397	R15EO0EHJWOTEZ	059600687X	686285753	IRC Hacks	Books	4	9	10	N	N	A good book for IRC bot developers	'IRC Hacks' is not a more recent version of Alex Charalabidis's 'The Book of IRC.'  Published by No Starch Press in 2000, 'The Book of IRC'  focuses on more introductory material, and thoroughly covers the issues facing most IRC users.  Unlike the older No Starch book, 'IRC Hacks' devotes over 200 pages to bot development.  In other words, the 'IRC Hacks' authors concentrate on more advanced ways to interact with IRC servers.  If this is your primary interest, you will enjoy 'IRC Hacks.'<br /><br />Since I am not interested in bot development, 'IRC Hacks' wasn't as useful to me as I had hoped.  I enjoyed on chapters discussing the IRC protocol (ch. 13) and setting up an IRC server (ch. 15).  Hacks about NickServ (#8) and ChanServ (#9) were interesting, and I may try the CtrlProxy hack (#93) to facilitate remote IRC access.<br /><br />'IRC Hacks' is fairly well written, although the editor should have ensured that terms were explained when first mentioned.  For example, CTCP appears on pages 10 and 48, with no expansion of the acronym or reference to hack #85 (which explains CTCP).  This is often a problem with books by teams of contributors.  I would have enjoyed more coverage of 'operational issues,' like problems associated with running an IRC server.  IRC networks have been targets of denial of service attacks and other adversarial activity for years, and the means by which IRC operators defend themselves would make good reading.<br /><br />If you need a book focused on bot development, give 'IRC Hacks' a try.  If you're more interested in IRC as a user, or even as an operator, ask Alex Charalabidis to write a second edition of 'The Book of IRC.'	2004-09-01
US	49796397	R24QM810HC7VP5	0201702452	667088525	The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System	Books	5	45	46	N	N	Hardly a wasted word in this guide to the FreeBSD kernel	I have been administering FreeBSD systems for four years, and I read 'The Design' to get a better understanding of the system 'under the hood.'  This book is definitely not for beginners, and intermediate users like myself can become quickly overwhelmed.  Nevertheless, I am very glad FreeBSD developers like McKusick and Neville-Neil took the time to document the kernel in this book.<br /><br />Before tackling 'The Design,' I recommend reading a book like 'Modern Operating Systems, 2nd Ed' by Andrew Tannenbaum.  The reader needs to be familiar with OS concepts and terms like 'mutex,' 'semaphore,' 'locking,' and so on before reading 'The Design.'  If for some reason you want to read 'The Design' but are not familiar with userland FreeBSD issues, I recommend Greg Lehey's 'Complete FreeBSD, 4th Ed.'<br /><br />I was unable to grasp all of the material in 'The Design,' since some of it will appeal only to those coding their own kernels or who are equipped to debate the FreeBSD core team's design choices.  In that respect the book is well suited for a college course (perhaps a master's level?) where the content could be discussed by a professor and students.  I was able to critically read the chapters covering networking (ch. 11-13) as I deploy FreeBSD partly for its robust TCP/IP stack.  Reading 'The Design' helped me understand some of Robert Watson's recent posts concerning removal of the GIANT lock from the networking subsystem, for example.<br /><br />There are many other parts of the book which non-kernel developers will find accessible.  Nearly every chapter features a well-written introduction to the technology at hand, such as memory management (ch. 5) or devices (ch. 7).  I found various bits of history helpful, like the development of NFS (ch. 9) or UNIX itself (ch. 1).  Those trying to understand issues concerning the new ULE scheduler will find ch. 4 enlightening.  The 38 page glossary is also excellent and the index is well-constructed.<br /><br />'The Design' is the sort of book I expect to consult when I need greater insight to a certain aspect of the FreeBSD kernel.  It's an excellent companion when one reads the freebsd-current mailing lists and needs background on the latest hot design issue.  I would be happy to see other operating systems have similar books published, so that an apples-to-apples comparison of their capabilities could be made by informed users.>'The Design' is the sort of book I expect to consult when I need greater insight to a certain aspect of the FreeBSD kernel.

'Defend IT' is the authors' response to feedback on their first book, where readers (like myself) claimed the case studies were the best aspect of 'Hack IT.' The vast majority of the new book contains 16 case studies, some of which I found very helpful.<br /><br /> My favorite chapter is 'Disaster All Around' (ch 9), where an Internet-centric insurance company suffers complete destruction of their primary data center. A fire caused by electrical problems exposes the company's lack of a disaster recovery plan and process for resuming business operations. Thanks to hard-working staff, the company was online in 72 hours -- but the CEO was fired! I was pleased to see a disaster recovery chapter in a general security book, as acts of God can be as devastating as the uber hacker who thinks he is God.<br /><br /> I commend ch 2 ('Home Architecture') for insights I find lacking in most books on intrusion detection or incident response. The authors astutely state on p. 26 and 33: 'this incident was not discovered by flashing lights and alerts set off by an IDS... In fact, there was no early indication of a network compromise.' This explains the authors' next recommendation: 'It is a good idea to keep access logs that are as detailed as possible -- at least with respect to inbound and outbound connections... Though you may not use these logs on a regular basis, for those instances when you need them, especially including investigations of network compromise, they are invaluable.&quot; Exactly!<br /><br /> 'Defend IT' suffered a few problems. Ch 3 features listing 3.1, which supposedly shows 'TCP SYN' packets part of a denial of service attack. Listing 3.1 doesn't show a single SYN packet, although many PSH ACK, UDP, and ICMP packets appear. Listing 3.2 claims to show SYN ACK packets from the DoS target, but only RST ACK packets from the victim and null TCP packets (with no flags set) from the attackers. Ch 3 also says 'DSL features fast download speeds... but slow upload speeds... ADSL features both fast upload and download speeds.' This is backwards; the 'A' in ADSL stands for 'asymmetric,' meaning faster downloads than uploads. I also found unnecessary redundancies in the forensics section, where two chapters (14 & 16) by the same author repeated material. I didn't think the conclusion matched the tone or content of the rest of the book, as it featured a hodge-podge of security technologies while the other 300 pages discussed case studies.<br /><br /> Overall, I enjoyed reading 'Defend IT.' I thought the chapters which featured network diagrams were enlightening, as information on real-world architectures can sometimes be difficult to find. I would caution the authors to ensure a second edition has slightly more current case studies. Ch 4, for example, suffers the myth that 'too few packets' on a wireless LAN is protection against cracking WEP; see the recent 'Wi-Foo' book for the real deal. Also, be careful when sanitizing data about clients. GPS coordinates and street names in screen shots might give away the farm, especially when readers have access to online business directories.) from the attackers.

'Wi-Foo' is the wireless book the security community needs. The book mixes theory, tools, and techniques in a manner helpful to those on the offensive or defensive side of the wireless equation. After reading 'Wi-Foo,' I'm glad I didn't try to cover similar topics in my 'Tao of Network Security Monitoring' -- these authors have written the definitive wireless 'hacking' text.<br /><br /> Several aspects of 'Wi-Foo' make the book a winner. First, with the exception of crypto topics in chapters 11 and 12, they tend to defer to previously published works rather than rehash old topics. For example, rather than exhaustively explain 802.11i, they refer readers to 'Real 802.11 Security,' an excellent defense-oriented wireless book. 'Wi-Foo' also assumes readers are familiar with TCP/IP and system administration, leaving out potentially redundant material.<br /><br /> Second, the authors demonstrate the degree to which they are plugged in to the wireless hacking community. They discuss developments from security conventions like Def Con, and explain tools and techniques not yet released (at time of writing) from the 'underground.' The number of tools explained by 'Wi-Foo' well exceeds that found in other wireless books, and the authors clearly explain why they prefer certain tools and discard others. This 'use what works' mentality is pervasive and effective, and I was very glad to see BSD tools featured along with the usual Linux suspects. I was particularly impressed by ch 9, where readers learn what to do next after compromising a wireless network. Other books stop at 'cracking WEP,' for example. Ch 4 and 7 also give the best advice I've seen on different aspects of wireless hardware, on a chipset-comparison level.<br /><br /> Finally, the authors complement their advice on wireless vulnerability assessment and penetration testing with sound defensive strategies. Ch 13 explains how to combine FreeRADIUS, open1x, and OpenLDAP to make an open source wireless authentication system. NoCat is discussed as an alternative. I was very happy to see an entire chapter on wireless IDS, especially the layer-based requirements listing. This serves as a good guide when checking the capabilities of commercial wireless IDS products.<br /><br /> The only drawback I see to 'Wi-Foo' is the inclusion of two chapters on crypto (ch 11 and 12). I would have preferred the authors to refer readers elsewhere, perhaps to a book like 'Cryptography Decrypted' or a heavier tome by Schneier or the like. I also noticed slightly rough English in some places, but these did not bother me like other books I've reviewed.<br /><br /> Overall, 'Wi-Foo' is the best book available for wireless assessment teams, explaining tools in an exceptional manner and smashing myths behind which security administrators hide. (Think your wireless network doesn't produce enough packets for WEP to be cracked? Read ch 8.) I'm adding 'Wi-Foo' to my 'Weapons and Tactics' Listmania List, and I recommend readers add this surprise hit to their bookshelves.tication system. NoCat is discussed as an alternative.

The publisher gained fame through its  assessment-oriented 'Hacking Exposed' series, and now it advocates preventing intrusions via configuration instead of assessment. (Those familiar with my Network Security Monitoring theories will remember I believe 'prevention eventually fails,' but I still recommend doing everything possible to make the intruder's task difficult!) HWS is a Windows security tour-de-force, and I intend to recommend it often.<br /><br /> I am blessed by not having to support Windows workstations or servers (other than my family's systems) because I run various UNIX variants at home and at work. If you're stuck defending Windows, HWS will show you how -- immediately. The book has literally one page of theory in ch 1 before advocating numerous 'do it now!' steps. This direct approach keeps the book at a manageable 500 pages or so, yet doesn't skip the details.<br /><br /> Furthermore, the term 'Windows' doesn't just mean Windows 2000, the current 'corporate standard' (despite Microsoft's best efforts to encourage upgrades). HWS actually spends time on servers like Windows NT 4, 2000, and 2003, and clients like NT 4, 2000, and XP. Even Windows 95 and 98 receive a few mentions. I was impressed by real advice for operating three sorts of 'domains' in ch 4 -- workgroups, NT 4 domains, or Active Directory forests. Too often Microsoft concentrates on the latest and greatest, but HWS recognizes corporate realities.<br /><br /> HWS includes some of the most information-packed tables I've ever seen. Table 5-3, explaining Windows services that can be disabled to improve security, is awesome. Table 9-3, recommending IE security settings, is similarly helpful. Author Bragg packs so much detail into these tables that reading them alone will help your security efforts. Screen shots are also shown to supplement the step-by-step instructions needed to configure Windows.<br /><br /> My only real criticism is the complete focus on Windows-bundled features. There is no mention of helpful third party applications, like OpenSSH, Cygwin, or Perl. A great older book on Windows security called _Securing Windows NT/2000 Servers for the Internet_ explained these and other options. Integration with non-Windows systems and services, like sending Windows Event Logs to syslog servers, would recognize the heterogeneous nature of modern enterprises. I would also like to see information on profiling Windows systems, displaying the ports and services expected to be active. This would help sys admins understand normal Windows behavior and possibly identify intruder activity.<br /><br /> I plan to add HWS to my recommended reading Listmania List, and I hope you consider this book if securing Windows systems is on your to-do list.tep-by-step instructions needed to configure Windows. <br />  <br /> My only real criticism is the complete focus on Windows-bundled features.

Excerpts from that review appear on the back cover and first page of &quot;Snort 2.1,&quot; published only 14 months later.  I still think &quot;Snort 2.1&quot; is overall the best Snort book available, but I was disappointed by signs of rushed production and lack of coverage of key Snort features.<br />The table of contents for &quot;Snort 2.1&quot; is deceiving, as it is almost exactly the same as &quot;Snort 2.0.&quot;  However, the new book is almost 200 pages larger than its predecessor, with many internal modifications.  Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 12 and 13 are either completely new or substantially new.  Chapters 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 are either partial rewrites or have some material added or dropped.  Despite all of this work, &quot;Snort 2.1&quot; fails to spend time on key subjects, which I will mention during a chapter-by-chapter examination of the book.<br />First, I recommend skipping ch 1.  Aside from some general IDS advice, it is haphazard and contributes nothing to the core Snort discussion.  Ch 2 is a quick overview of Snort capabilities, and should have been the lead chapter.  Ch 3 describes Snort installation, but suffers apparently swapped figures (3.1 and 3.2) and a wrong figure (3.5).  Ch 3 is still a nice upgrade from its counterpart in &quot;Snort 2.0,&quot; which gave hints for deploying Snort on Red Hat Linux 8.0.  The new ch 3 covers Linux, OpenBSD, and Windows.<br />Ch 4, &quot;Inner Workings,&quot; is one of the reasons &quot;Snort 2.1&quot; has an advantage over the competition.  It's tough to go wrong when Snort's developers describe the tool's operation.  Still, signs of rough editing appear on p. 170 and 191, and the &quot;-a cmg&quot; switch should be &quot;-A cmg&quot;.<br />Ch 5 covers rules, and is a big disappointment.  For most users, rules are the primary means to customize Snort.  Like &quot;Snort 2.0,&quot; ch 5 fails to help readers with some of the more important new Snort rule options, like byte_test, byte_jump, distance, and within (available since 2.0.rc1 in Mar 03).  Ch 5 implies on p. 145 that running Snort with -v is a good idea, despite every other recommendation in the book that verbose mode is a performance killer.  Also, the IP &quot;sec&quot; option mentioned on p. 205 is not &quot;IPSec&quot; -- see RFC 791.  Overall, ch 5 spends too much time restating rule information found in Snort's manual, and not enough time on features available even in Snort 2.0.<br />Ch 6's discussion of preprocessors is a solid chapter, with new material on Snort's flow module, http_inspect, and perfmonitor.  The telnet preprocessor section is one of the better examples of a &quot;code walkthrough,&quot; where the author shows code while explaining what it does.<br />Ch 7 is really showing its age.  &quot;Snort 2.0&quot; was behind the times when it said &quot;Unified logs are the future of Snort reporting,&quot; and &quot;Snort 2.1&quot; makes the same mistake.  Barnyard, a means to read unified logs, was available in Sep 01!  Ch 7 also misses the boat on XML output, calling it &quot;our favorite and relatively new logging format&quot; on p. 322.  The XML plug-in spo_xml wasn't even part of snort-2.0.0, never mind snort-2.1.0.  Basic research would have revealed Joe McAlerney's announcement of Silicon Defense's snort-idmef XML plug-in in Jun 01, followed by Sandro Poppi's assumption of the project in Aug 03.  A mention of Barnyard's &quot;XML formatting capabilities&quot; appears in ch 7 on p. 322, yet Barnyard does not offer this natively.<br />I was happy to see Sguil addressed in ch 8, but sad to see Sguil's use of session and full content data not appreciated for its true worth.  Ch 9 does a good job describing Oinkmaster and gives sound advice on avoiding the &quot;not any&quot; rule negation problem.  Ch 10 covers really old testing tools like Sneeze, whose stateless operation cannot fool stream4's stateful inspection.<br />Ch 11, explaining Barnyard, is clearly the book's shining moment. This is the reason I read &quot;Snort 2.1&quot;: Barnyard's author, Andrew Baker, describes Barnyard's history, the format of unified logs, and how best to use his contribution to Snort.  Bravo.  Ch 12 was also very good, using case studies to compare three different &quot;active response&quot; choices.  Ch 13 was new but not exceptionally helpful.<br />I would enjoy seeing three improvements in the third edition.  First, thoroughly scrub the book for old information.

This is the reason I read &quot;Snort 2.1&quot;: Barnyard's author, Andrew Baker, describes Barnyard's history, the format of unified logs, and how best to use his contribution to Snort.  Bravo.  Ch 12 was also very good, using case studies to compare three different &quot;active response&quot; choices.  Ch 13 was new but not exceptionally helpful.<br />I would enjoy seeing three improvements in the third edition.  First, thoroughly scrub the book for old information.

US	49796397	R1ZDTPGJYBCDDG	0596006799	457385134	BSD Hacks	Books	5	21	22	N	N	I was hooked by hack 10	&quot;BSD Hacks&quot; is the book I hoped to read.  I've been using FreeBSD in production and test environments for about four years (since 4.1 REL), and I've played with OpenBSD and NetBSD for about a year each.  I was looking for a book that would explore the nooks and crannies of BSD without covering the introductory issues often found elsewhere.  By hack 10 I had already learned enough to justify purchasing &quot;BSD Hacks.&quot;  Unless you're a member of the core team, you'll find enough tricks and tips to make &quot;BSD Hacks&quot;  a welcome addition to your system administration library.<br />In the first chapter on customizing the user environment, I learned multiple ways to make using BSD easier.  Simple hints proved especially helpful, like ctrl-a and ctrl-e for moving around on the command line, or 'cd -' for changing to the last directory, or 'set autolist' to bring tab completion with lists to the tcsh shell.  I wondered how I managed to navigate the command line without this keystroke-saving advice.<br />Author Dru Lavigne demonstrated a wonderful talent for finding useful tools in the BSD ports tree.  Applications like Unison, Ghost for UNIX, and ClusterIT are all waiting to be used, and &quot;BSD Hacks&quot; brings them to life in an easy-to-read manner.  There's also plenty of sound administration recommendations, like creating an emergency repair kit, automating installs, and creating scponly-based shells.  I like the tuning suggestions in hack 69 and would have liked more information on that subject.  These sorts of hacks leverage existing capabilities in the OS to enhance the administrator's ability to meet user needs.  I would probably have not considered them (even with the BSD's thorough man pages) without reading &quot;BSD Hacks.&quot;<br />My only concern with the book involves coverage of material best done elsewhere.  For example, hack 46 covers Tcpdump.  Since this is not a networking book, I didn't think Tcpdump needed its own section.  The author also needed to clarify the octet counting section for the TCP header.  By the time the TCP flags are reached in octet 13, we've already moved through 13 octets (numbered 0 to 12), not 12 as implied by the book.  Hack 59 addresses Snort, perhaps the most well-worn topic in network security.  With a half dozen books on Snort alone and another half dozen with chapters on the open source IDS, I didn't need to read more instructions on installing it.<br />Overall, I was very happy to read &quot;BSD Hacks.&quot;  It's an absolute must-buy, with its informational content easily justifying its low cover price.  I recommend readers submit hacks of their own to O'Reilly for future editions.  For example, hack 81 could have mentioned using &quot;make package-recursive&quot; to create packages of a port and its dependencies.  Hack 80 should probably have used the &quot;RELENG_5_1&quot; tag to track the security release of FreeBSD 5.1, not &quot;RELENG_5_1_0&quot;, which would make no changes whatsoever to a system already running 5.1 REL.  Hack 82 could have mentioned the portcheckout tool to build a port without access to the whole tree.  Books like &quot;BSD Hacks&quot; are an excellent way to demonstrate the power and elegance of BSD, and expand its influence to those looking for alternatives to Windows and Linux.The author also needed to clarify the octet counting section for the TCP header.

US	49796397	R37OHGB1G66BYO	0596006438	93502447	Network Security Hacks	Books	4	24	25	N	N	A handy guide when trying unfamiliar tools or techniques	&quot;Network Security Hacks&quot; (NSH) has something for nearly everyone, although it focuses squarely on Linux, BSD, and Windows, in that order of preference.  Administrators for commercial UNIX variants (Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, etc.) should be able to apply much of the book's advice to their environments, but they are not the target audience.  NSH is written for admins needing quick-start guides for common security tools, and in this respect it delivers.<br />I found NSH to be most rewarding when it avoided discussing the same topics everyone else has covered.  Lesser known tools like authpf, ftester, sniffdet, SFS, rpcapd, and Sguil caught my interest (especially as I write Sguil installation docs).  Even some ways to use familiar tools were helpful, like the -f (fork) and -N (no command) switches for SSH forwarding.  In some cases it made sense to mention well-worn topics like BIND or MySQL, with an eye towards quickly augmenting the security of those servers.<br />Elsewhere I questioned the need to cover certain tools.  With the number of Snort titles approaching double digits, and O'Reilly's own Snort books in the wings, was it really necessary to devote several hacks to Snort?  In the same respect, I felt mention of Nmap, Nessus, swatch, and ACID was not needed, nor was advice on implementing certain Windows security features.<br />In some cases the descriptions were too brief to really explain the technologies at hand.  For example, the &quot;Secure Tunnels&quot; chapter discusses a very specific IPSec scenario (wireless client to gateway) without informing the reader of the other sorts of tunnels that are possible.  I also questioned some of the content, like p. 47's statement that Windows lacks &quot;robust built-in scripting.&quot;  Brian Knittel's &quot;Windows XP Under the Hood&quot; would quickly change the author's mind.  Also, the anomaly detection preprocessor SPADE is described, even though the last version (Spade-030125.1.tgz, released Jan 03) is only available on a Polish student's Web server and no longer cleanly integrates with Snort past version 2.0.5, released in Nov 03.<br />Despite these comments, I still found NSH a great addition to my security bookshelf.  I found the coverage of Windows more than adequate, given that true security innovation in the public sphere is being done in the open source world and not in Redmond's labs.  The writing tends to be clear and the descriptions concise.  I guarantee you will find a handful of hacks which pique your curiosity and ultimately help secure your enterprise.nly available on a Polish student's Web server and no longer cleanly integrates with Snort past version 2.0.5, released in Nov 03.<br />Despite these comments, I still found NSH a great addition to my security bookshelf.

US	49796397	R33VPNKJGSWP3T	0321193660	96005573	Secure Architectures with OpenBSD	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Excellent on its own or as a companion to &quot;Absolute OpenBSD&quot;	About a year ago I read and reviewed Michael Lucas' excellent &quot;Absolute OpenBSD.&quot;  That book covered OpenBSD 3.2 and the CURRENT of that time, pre-3.3.  Palmer and Nazario's &quot;Secure Architectures with OpenBSD&quot; (SAWO) addresses OpenBSD 3.4, which at the time of writing is just behind the current release (3.5).  Lucas' book is an excellent introduction to OpenBSD by a relative outsider; SAWO is a more detailed discussion by insiders.  Each has its strengths and I highly recommend both.<br />My favorite aspect of SAWO is its coverage of the internal workings of certain aspects of OpenBSD.  Ch 4 features an enlightening walk-through of the /etc/rc script.  Ch 13 not only describes how to use the ports tree, it explains how that system of software installation works.  In some cases the authors reach beyond subjects strictly associated with OpenBSD, such as compilers (ch 21) and CVS (appendix A and elsewhere).  As OpenBSD relies heavily on widely-used open source tools for standard administration, I welcome these discussions.<br />I also congratulate the authors' decision to focus on practical aspects of OpenBSD administration or functionality.  Ch 3 gives installation advice for non-i386 hardware users.  Ch 17 explains how to enable STARTTLS.  Ch 22 shows why Pf is superior to many or most commercial firewalls.  Some of the material can even be applied to the other BSDs, like the coverage of mergemaster in ch 31 or the advice on using IPv6 in tandem with IPv4 in ch 28.<br />I only have a few critiques of SAWO.  Ch 27 (VPNs) was a little terse and hard to follow.  I didn't think the authors needed to address applications like Snort (ch 30), when entire best-selling books are written about that very topic.  I did not see a single diagram in the whole book.  A picture speaks a thousand words, especially when explaining IPSec modes!<br />The second edition of SAWO will have plenty to add, including coverage of spamd, Common Address Redundancy Protocol (CARP), and pfsync.  I suggest BSD users of all types take a close look at SAWO and consider supporting the OpenBSD project by purchasing  books like this and official OpenBSD CDs.CARP), and pfsync.

US	49796397	R2PM02DPG6AAO1	1931836019	32990326	Security Sage's Guide to Hardening the Network Infrastructure	Books	3	10	15	N	N	Disappointing lack of original material and command syntax	This is a tough review to write, since I worked with the lead authors and series editor at Foundstone, and I'm mentioned by name on p. 384.  &quot;Security Sage's Guide to Hardening the Network Infrastructure&quot; (HTNI) is mainly a collection of advice given in other security books, packaged with brochure-like commercial product descriptions.  Much of the technical defensive recommendations lack the command-level syntax to put that advice into practical use.  I was excited by the table of contents, but disappointed once I finished the book.  I can't recommend HTNI unless your library doesn't already address essential networking and security techniques.<br />Let me first address comments by earlier reviewers.  Some liked the &quot;Notes from the Underground.&quot;  These &quot;notes&quot; seem out of place when they bear titles like &quot;Novell and Ethernet Frame Types&quot; or &quot;Types of Ethernet&quot; (both ch 7); they belong in standard networking texts.  Another reviewer said &quot;the writing is witty, intelligent and doesn't condescend.&quot;  I disagree after reading this sentence on p. 141: &quot;Add to this the fact that Microsoft is certainly the 'black sheep' of the security world and you end up with one disaster of a firewall product.&quot;  Another gem appears on p. 322, regarding SOHO switches: &quot;And while you're at your favorite hardware vendor getting the switches, pick us up a pack of beef jerky.&quot;  That isn't &quot;witty&quot; -- it's an unnecessary slam on small offices who can't fork over &quot;half a million dollars&quot; in switching gear (see p. 321) but need Internet access nevertheless.<br />Another reviewer liked the &quot;hands-on and practical guidance.&quot;  This is where the book is weakest.  Why does an entire chapter on router security (ch 5) not provide any command syntax at all for securing a Cisco router?  While ch 8 gives a few helpful commands, it is hardly comprehensive.  For example, SSH is mentioned as a secure management protocol, but setup instructions for IOS are missing.  Instead of providing product screen shots with little informational content, the authors should show how to &quot;harden the network infrastructure&quot; as readers expect.<br />HTNI's coordinating author needed to apply greater consistency to the text, since it bears the signs of being written by several independent authors.  For example, some network diagrams are fairly clear, while others use completely different symbols and are not easy to follow.  Some figures convey useful ideas, like the logical network layouts in ch 10, while ch 3's figure 3.8 shows two Pix firewalls connected by a cable.  Do we need to see this figure to understand how to link two firewalls for sharing redundancy tables?  Speaking of redundancy, topics covered in one section are often repeated elsewhere; too many contributors felt compelled to explain firewall variations or the OSI model.  Some of the Web links were also incorrect, with &quot;ntomap&quot; in ch 2 attributed to NAI (rather than NT Objectives) and my own Web site given a &quot;.org&quot; TLD instead of &quot;.com&quot;.<br />I did find some aspects of HTNI useful.  I liked the stories about asset criticality in ch 1.  I thought the advice, albeit lacking implementation-level details, was sound overall.  The authors seemed to cover competitors to their own Foundstone brands fairly, although their products got more screen shots.  I also liked the &quot;mini case studies&quot; in ch 7 addressing switch deployment.<br />I came to HTNI after reading a five-star Syngress book on Ethereal, and I'm looking forward to their new book on Snort 2.1.  I thought Erik Birkholz's &quot;Special Ops&quot; (another Syngress book) was excellent, and placed it on my recommended reading list.  Other Foundstone-supported books like &quot;Hacking Exposed,&quot; &quot;Incident Response,&quot; or &quot;Anti-Hacker Tool Kit&quot; are great reads.  HTNI is full of ideas, but they are either old news or lacking the command-level syntax to implement them in the reader's enterprise.  A second edition of HTNI would be a winner if thoroughly scrubbed and suitably enhanced by actionable advice.ther old news or lacking the command-level syntax to implement them in the reader's enterprise.

US	49796397	R6J2G8ZYWRJC7	0131014056	542136605	Malware: Fighting Malicious Code	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Another tour de force from one of the community's best	I reviewed Ed's &quot;Counter Hack&quot; in Nov 2001, giving it five stars as the perfect introduction for newcomers to the security field.  2 1/2 years later I'm happy to say &quot;Malware&quot; delivers the same quality, clarity, and insight that made &quot;Counter Hack&quot; a winner.  My only regret is not having read and reviewed &quot;Malware&quot; sooner!<br />One of the impressive aspects of this book is the degree to which it is &quot;future-proofed.&quot;  Ed looks at current threats like worms, viruses, trojans, and user- and kernel-mode rootkits, like any author might.  He then takes malicious software to the next level, from the kernel to BIOS and finally to CPU microcode.  These BIOS- and microcode-level attacks are still largely theoretical (aside from BIOS-destroying code), at least as far as the public knows.  When the world sees these threats emerge, &quot;Malware&quot; will be waiting to explain their capabilities.<br />Ed writes exceptionally well, bringing coverage of Linux and Windows kernel internals to the masses.  I enjoyed learning about the trojaned Tcpdump distribution, anti-forensics, DLL injection, and API hooking.  Lenny Zeltser's chapters on malware analysis were helpful as well, and I recommend attending his reverse engineering classes.  The book also shines with respect to skillful use of tables and diagrams to explain key points.<br />The only technical inaccuracy I found was the proposition that UNIX filesystems maintain a c_time as &quot;creation time&quot; (p. 319 and elsewhere).  c_time is &quot;change of inode time,&quot; like changing permissions on a file.  Windows' NTFS &quot;c_time&quot; is indeed &quot;creation time,&quot; however.  I also found myself skipping many of the author's analogies, like the king, knights, castle, etc. story in the BIOS/microcode discussion.  Ed's writing is clear enough that anyone with some technical experience should be able to understand his points without falling back on analogies.<br />I highly recommend &quot;Malware&quot; to anyone who wants to understand the capabilities of our digital enemies.  Many other security books are vulnerability-focused, spending time explaining ways to subvert, breach, or abuse poorly designed or deployed applications.  &quot;Malware&quot; is threat-oriented, showing the capabilities of intruders and their code.  This knowledge will change the way you think about security and the trustworthiness of your systems -- especially those exposed to the harsh reality of the Internet.highly recommend &quot;Malware&quot; to anyone who wants to understand the capabilities of our digital enemies.

All three represent the lowest end of malware, with spam occupying a particularly disdainful place in the computer security hierarchy.  I wasn't very excited when a review copy of &quot;Anti-Spam Tool Kit&quot; (ASTK) arrived in the mail, but I found myself drawn in by the value of the content and tools it described.  I highly recommend anyone tasked with fighting spam read ASTK.<br />This book is the first to follow in the genre defined by &quot;Anti-Hacker Tool Kit.&quot;  While AHTK examined tools used by intruders and defenders, ASTK focuses on tools and techniques to counter unwanted email.  AHTK has slightly more coverage of Windows than UNIX applications; ASTK spends more time on Windows, especially with client configurations.  As a desktop FreeBSD user, I still found plenty of helpful information.<br />Since I'm not directly responsible for enterprise anti-spam defenses, ASTK's comparison of the many block lists was particularly enlightening.  Prior to reading ch 5 I knew of many lists but not their particular capabilities.  I found the coverage of SpamAssassin in chs 6-8 fairly thorough.  Ch 14's overview of email and headers very helpful.  I had not heard of server-based greylisting until reading ch 15.<br />I found a few of the authors' comments odd.  On p. 250 they claim &quot;most organizations do not run UNIX-based email solutions.&quot;  I find this difficult to believe, but no proof for the statement is given.  Figure 2.2 in ch 2 shows a mail sender using POP/POP-SSL/IMAP/IMAP-SSL to send email.  At least using Mozilla and Firefox on UNIX, I connect to my ISP's SMTP server to send email and then retrieve it with POP or IMAP.  In ch 3 the authors advocate IPv6 because it makes &quot;a spammer's identity known and verified even if he or she doesn't want it to be.&quot;  IPv6 should not change many, or any, spammer tactics.  Spammers aren't forging TCP sessions with IPv4 now; they forge information (headers, etc.) transferred within application layer data.  I believe some of these weird comments could have been addressed by more diligent technical editing.<br />Overall, I found ASTK enlightening and practical.  The authors give enough details on various server- and client-side tools to make implementation (at least on a trial basis) possible.  I look forward to other tool-related books in the &quot;Anti-Hacker&quot; series.(headers, etc.) transferred within application layer data.

This second edition (AHT:2E) follows only 18 months after the original was published.  I don't believe enough time has passed to warrant an update, even though tools can evolve quickly.  In certain aspects the book suffers from a lack of updates from AHT:1E author Keith Jones, who found the publisher's demands onerous.  Nevertheless, AHT:2E is a must-buy if you didn't read AHT:1E.<br />The major additions to AHT:2E include a new chapter on firewalls, which doesn't really add anything new to the common body of security knowledge.  A new chapter on host hardening covers Titan and MSec.  Tools like THC-Amap, THC-Hydra, HFNetChk, Ettercap, Wellenreiter, and Kismet make appearances as well.  Whereas Trinux was only mentioned in the first edition, it gets welcome coverage in the chapter on building live response bootable CDs.  Updated material on Nmap, NetScan Tools, SuperScan, Scanline, and commercial forensic suites is included.<br />The remainder of the book is largely the same.  Particularly, chapters on Netcat, X, VMWare, Cygwin, backdoors, source code auditing, port redirection, war dialers, and open source forensics appear very similar to AHT:1E.  Deleted from AHT:2E are Whisker, Twwwscan/Arirang, SMBGrind, and Nbaudit.  Comparisons with the first edition are somewhat complicated by the rearrangement of tools and chapters in AHT:2E, but I thought the new organization made sense.<br />Aside from the information on using Trinux, AHT:2E seemed to lack new contributions from an author with real forensic experience.  Keith Jones' original material is still present, but advancements in the forensic arena are not covered.  For example, AHT:2E should have addressed Keith's tools in the Odessa project, such as Galleta (cookie parsing), Pasco (IE history recovery), and Rifiuti (Recycle Bin examination).<br />Overall, AHT:2E is an excellent book, but I don't believe a second edition was needed 18 months after the first was published.  The AHT look and feel has spawned the &quot;Anti-Spam Tool Kit,&quot; which I plan to read and review shortly.  Perhaps future AHT books will split out various sections (assessment, forensics, etc.) into separate volumes, making it easier to manage the series.eded 18 months after the first was published.

Does the shorter gap between OS availability and book publication hurt the successor to the original hit Windows security book?  It's possible, but I don't see many contenders for the title of best Windows assessment guide.  Because this book delivers the technical goods in a proven format, I give HE:W03 four stars.<br />I gave the original HE:W2K five stars for finally breaking out Windows-specific security material into its own &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; title.  HE:W03 is mainly an update of its predecessor, a fact I confirmed with a chapter-by-chapter evaluation.  HE:W03 has a new foreword and better organization.  Ch 1 sports five more pages, and ch 2 offers a new discussion on service accounts and groups.  Ch 4 adds an RPC enumeration section while ch 5 provides info on sniffing Kerberos authentication.  Ch 6 mentions exploiting the Windows debugger but is short on details.  Ch 7 explains psexec and ch 8 explains usage of MDcrack.  Ch 10 gives new info on IIS 6, ch 11 mentions SQL Slammer and more defensive strategies, and ch 12 updates remote access methods for Windows XP and 2003.  Ch 13 presents a few recent client-side attacks and ch 16 mentions several defensive tools.  Ch 17 is mainly original, although the Windows OS roadmap appears as dated as the one first proposed in HE:W2K.  Oddly, chs 9, 10, and 16 were missing material, like talk of hiding files via streaming and the &quot;runas&quot; command.  Ch 3, 14, and 15 are mostly the same.<br />HE:W03 is still the best book available if you want to learn how to assess and compromise Windows servers using publicly available tools.  It will not teach original exploitation techniques like coding exploits, although this is usually unnecessary when admins deploy stock servers with blank administrator passwords.  The authors are experts when it comes to performing pen tests of Windows targets, even though they are unapologetic Windows fans.  (Page 195 bears the quote &quot;command-line brain damage of Linux.&quot;)  Their bias is also apparent as they question the applicability of the word &quot;monopoly&quot; to Microsoft (a legal fact); this isn't surprising given the authors' employers.  Their bias also colors their judgment in the introduction, where they propose that security is a zero sum game between security and usability.  Attitudes like that can no longer cover for Microsoft's security lapses.<br />If you're forced to run Microsoft products, it pays to understand how intruders can compromise them.  It's also helpful to know how to defend those systems.

Should NSA receive a second edition, I expect to see the book expand closer to the &quot;behemoth&quot; it seems to deride.<br />The best chapter by far was ch. 11, where the author with assistance from Michael Thumann takes the reader on a tour of exploiting vulnerable code.  The stack diagrams and code snippets were especially helpful and the explanations were clear enough.  This sort of material is a solid introduction to some of the techniques found in &quot;Security Warrior.&quot;  I also liked ch. 14, where the author explains a sample assessment using the tools already introduced.  Kudos as well for maintaining an errata page and tool archive on the publisher's Web site.<br />The advantage NSA has over HE is the variety of tools on hand.  I learned of at least a dozen tools not mentioned elsewhere.  The author seems to be thorough while listing various exploitable flaws from the last several years.  While the prose is well-written, I believe the HE series does a better job communicating fundamentals of the underlying technology.  In other words, HE gives better explanations of 'what' we are compromising, while &quot;NSA&quot; prefers to concentrate more on the compromising itself.  This technology education aspect of the HE series has always been its strong point.  For example, there's no need to read a 500 page book on Microsoft FrontPage to understand the problems with it when a quick look in a HE book explains the technology's basics as well as its security flaws.<br />It's been over a year since the 4th edition of HE was published, so I recommend buying NSA to freshen your assessment skills.  For the scenarios it does cover, which include most UNIX and Windows Internet-based attacks, it is thorough and accurate.  Combined with O'Reilly's &quot;Security Warrior,&quot; NSA presents an updated picture of the assessment scene.ying technology.

Although the user is often &quot;shielded&quot; from interacting with the database directly, it's important and sometimes crucial to know basic MySQL administration.<br />&quot;MySQL Tutorial&quot; is the perfect companion to any security tool which depends on a MySQL database.  For example, no one seriously expects to collect large amounts of data with Sguil and Snort unless a MySQL or similar database is working in the background.  &quot;MySQL Tutorial&quot; gives the right details on the right subjects for those running integrated MySQL databases.<br />This book is not for Oracle gurus.  It's for people who need basic understanding of MySQL installation, configuration, security, and administration.  I found the authors' explanations clear and relevant, hitting the high points I would expect in a 267 page book.  The text is example-driven, using a sample &quot;employee&quot; database to demonstrate various administration tasks.<br />The only real fault I found involves the scripts at the publisher's Web site.  They create a sample database whose naming convention differs from the book's description.  For example, the scripts create an &quot;employee_skills&quot; table, but the book speaks of &quot;employeeSkills&quot;.  The best answer to this problem is to manually correct the scripts prior to running them, or to type in the examples by hand.<br /><br />&quot;MySQL Tutorial&quot; met my expectations, with a page count and price far more reasonable than many tech titles available today.  I recommend this book to anyone who uses MySQL in a role supporting intrusion detection systems, Web servers, or similar applications.	2004-05-01

It's a great book to lead the way.  &quot;Ethereal&quot; is full of helpful tips and clear discussions that benefit newbies and wizards alike.<br />I've been using Ethereal for around five years, and this book still taught me a few new tricks.  The key to the new material is Ethereal's development, from 0.2 in July 1998 to 0.10.3 this year.  (The book covers 0.10.0 which is far from being outdated.)  The many improvements lend themselves to the sort of explanations found in &quot;Ethereal.&quot;  For example, my favorite material involved filters.  Although chs. 4 and 5 had minor overlap regarding this feature, I learned new ways to manipulate Ethereal's packet search and display capabilities.<br />Because the entire book focuses on a single suite of tools, it has the space to take in-depth looks at normally ignored components like stream analysis graphs.  The book spends time explaining how to write filters with bitwise AND operations, and talks about 'matches' and 'contains' search functions.  For programmers, the chapter on &quot;developing Ethereal&quot; gives clues on adding new protocol dissectors.  This reminded me of a similar chapter in Syngress' book on Snort.<br />If you want to really know how to use Ethereal, buy this book.  However, it should have been called &quot;Ethereal Packet Sniffer,&quot;  not &quot;Ethereal Packet Sniffing.&quot;  The distinction lies in the book's focus; it spends most of its time explaining functions and not analyzing packets.  Books on troubleshooting by Bardwell or Haugdahl have more insights to share than ch. 8 in &quot;Ethereal.&quot;  Nevertheless, I added this book to my recommended reading list for aspiring security engineers.  It's worth a close read.	2004-05-01

The book does a good job debunking certain myths, such as the prevalence of &quot;warchalking&quot; or the widespread use of &quot;Pringles can antennas.&quot;  I found the practical advice, like disabling the TCP/IP stack on Windows prior to wardriving, especially helpful.  The authors constantly advocate a professional mindset towards wardriving and do not suggest unethical use of insecure wireless networks.<br /><br />&quot;WarDriving&quot; suffers from several drawbacks.  The book was written by multiple authors, and the lead author failed to remove redundant material.  For example, ch. 3 repeats the advice and instructions found in ch. 1 regarding disabling Windows' TCP/IP stack.  Ch. 3 also gives virtually the same advice on assembling wireless equipment, including more screenshots of gear and discussions of NetStumbler found in ch. 2.  All of this should have been consolidated.<br />I did not find the majority of screen captures in the various &quot;installation&quot; chapters helpful.  Why take up 1/3 of a page with an essentially blank screen capture that only features the &quot;su -&quot; command?  All similar information could have been presented as inline text.  Many other screen captures offered fonts that were too small to show meaningful details.  For example, many of the Kismet shots in ch. 6 are mostly blank screens with small text stuffed into the top or corners.  The author should have resized his terminal with capturing the screen in mind.<br />Technically, I found the book accurate.  I was not happy to see MAC defined as &quot;machine access code&quot; in the first half of the book and as &quot;media access control&quot; in ch. 10.  (The second expansion is the norm, although Asante oddly uses the first.)  Although the book covered Kismet, NetStumbler, and derivatives, it did not feature bsd-airtools or defensive measures like Snort-wireless.<br />Ch. 8, &quot;Organizing WarDrives,&quot; was my favorite.  While the majority of the book offered installation and configuration guides for networking equipment, ch. 8 provided original, helpful advice on conducting formal wardrives.  It's one of the better pieces of &quot;hacker history&quot; I've seen in recent years.  Ch. 8 alone supports the idea that wardriving is a legitimate activity not solely done by &quot;black hats.&quot;<br />If you want to learn how to wardrive, this book will help you.  The book could have been half as long and half as expensive if it had consolidated redundant material and replaced many screenshots with equally relevant text.  Moving beyond advice on proper equipment configuration would take this book to the next level.  Information on detecting and responding to disassociation attacks or simple unauthorized use of the network would be welcome in a second edition.wireless.  <br />Ch. 8, &quot;Organizing WarDrives,&quot; was my favorite.

Peikari and Chuvakin offer a dark counterpart to O'Reilly classics like &quot;Practical UNIX and Internet Security&quot; (PUAIS) and &quot;Securing Windows NT/2000 Servers for the Internet.&quot;  If you've been waiting for the next good security book from O'Reilly, &quot;Security Warrior&quot; (SW) is it.<br />Part I, &quot;Software Cracking,&quot; was my favorite section.  This material is largely not for beginners, which marked a welcome change from many competing books.  Part I gave an introduction to assembly language, followed by reverse engineering exercises on Windows, Linux, and Windows CE.  I admit a good portion of the section was beyond my skill level, but I was able to &quot;patch&quot; binaries to alter program flow and even use a buffer overflow to execute previously unreachable code in a sample program.  These sorts of &quot;hands-on&quot; exercises were informative and enjoyable.<br />In the second part, &quot;Network Stalking,&quot; I was pleased to see page 181 correctly state the role played by TCP sequence numbers.  (Many authors are confused by this concept, oddly.)  An entire chapter on social engineering advice was certainly novel.  For the rest of the book, my favorite chapter (number 10) discussed techniques to frustrate forensic analysis.  A fairly brief chapter on SQL injection made good points as did an examination of mathematics' role in intrusion detection in chapter 19.<br />My only real criticism of SW centers on inclusion of generic security information.  I didn't mark the book down for chapters on securing UNIX, for example, as the material is sound.  However, if you've got PUAIS you can skip chapters 11 and 12.<br />SW has something for everyone in the security community.  It's a broad survey of current security issues, ranging from detailed analysis of assembly language to case studies on incident response.  The authors have packed a lot of value into their 500+ page work.work.	2004-02-09

(&quot;UNIX&quot; means the original OS as well as derivatives and relatives.)  Rather than discuss the filesystem, commands, or services, TAOUP explains history, culture, and rationale.  I found the book enlightening and easy to read and recommend it to all UNIX users.<br />Several reviewers critique author Eric Raymond's assessments of programming languages and the Windows OS family.  As a security engineer I see Windows continue to fail miserably, so much so that I'm beginning to agree that Windows cannot be secured.  (Almost one year ago I criticized Bellovin et al for the same judgment, but now I tend to agree.)  I would be surprised if a real Windows advocate reviewed and contributed to drafts of TAOUP, as a few strategic pro-Windows points might have made ESR's other arguments stronger.  A second way to strengthen the anti-Windows stance would be more technical discussion of Windows flaws.  The devastating &quot;shatter&quot; flaws of 2002 merit no more than a footnote on page 69, but could have a been a whole section unto themselves.<br />Regarding languages and OS comparisons, at this early point in my career I fit the &quot;fool&quot; category of p. 507.  I leave it to more experienced developers to debate programming language virtues.  It seems the author is not as current on language developments as his critics, which is regrettable but understandable given TAOUP's scope.  I personally questioned the repeated invocation of Emacs Lisp.  I found ESR's recommendation to employ interpreted languages useful and plan to take a closer look at Python.  I question ESR's claim on p. 382 that GCC is so powerful that &quot;there is effectively no proprietary UNIX compiler market left,&quot; when Sun's compiler for Solaris seems to outperform GCC.<br />I found histories of &quot;UNIX vs. UNIX&quot; and &quot;UNIX vs the world&quot; very informative.  TAOUP presents concise explanations of licensing, RFC creation, and UNIX philosophy.  I was happy to see that an open source project to which I contribute (Sguil) met many UNIX design criteria, like text-based communication between small collaborating daemons.  I plan to follow TAOUP's recommendations for documentation so helpfully discussed in chapter 18 when I release the next set of Sguil guides.<br />TAOUP offers numerous priceless quotes from UNIX pioneers, but ESR himself offers my favorite: &quot;Open source is what happens when code reuse gets a flag and an army.&quot;  I hope UNIX advocates everywhere carry TAOUP into battle against their proprietary, monopolistic OS foes.  With a few more nods to the enemy and a more balanced comparison of languages, TAOUP will be unbeatable.formative.

It has a low average score because the author posted the first review with zero stars, which could be the result of an Amazon.com error.  I loved this book.  It gets right to the heart of the matter regarding the operations of microprocessors.  Anyone who wants to really know what happens inside their CPU will love ITM too.<br />Crisp speaks in a simple matter but conveys all of the important details I craved.  What exactly is an 8-bit microprocessor?  It's an integrated circuit with data registers each capable of holding 8-bit values.  \\"8-bit\\" doesn't mean the size of the data bus or the address bus.  The Pentium family is \\"32-bit\\" because it has 32-bit registers.  (The Pentium does have a 64 bit data bus.)<br />To explain microprocessors, Crisp uses the Zilog Z80 as a reference model.  I happen to have my first two computers, both 8-bit machines, in my basement: a C64C with a MOS 8510 and a Timex-Sinclair with Z80 and Z81 chips.  Crisp shows how the microprocessor executes instructions, why assembly helps humans write better programs, and what 8-bit memory maps look like.  ITM is written from the perspective of changes in voltage levels, translating into 0 and 1 values, that mean something to the microcode in the CPU.  Readers who desire a fundamental understanding of computers will appreciate Crisp's ability to explain these concepts in a clear and enjoyable manner.<br />The only drawback to this book is its 1998 publication date.  A lot has happened since the days of the 300 MHz Pentium II, and the most advanced Pentium features Crisp mentions is the MMX extensions to the original Pentium.  I noticed a second edition was just published this month, so I hope to read and review that book soon.<br />ITM is the perfect introduction for any serious computing student.  At a little over 200 pages, the book can be read in a few sittings.  It will prepare readers for more advanced material, or serve as a foundation for learning assembly language.  ITM is a nice companion to the CPU-related material in hardware books like Scott Mueller's \\"Upgrading and Repairing PCs.\\"rve as a foundation for learning assembly language.

US	49796397	R3DNXWNHEXMUAT	0072229543	780062269	Intrusion Detection and Prevention	Books	3	11	12	N	N	Some value, but doesn't meet expectations	I had high hopes for &quot;Intrusion Detection and Prevention&quot; (IDAP) as it is the first book to devote chapters to different vendor IDS products.  It's also the first to explicitly mention the buzzword &quot;intrusion prevention&quot; in its title.  Unfortunately, the book does not deliver the value I expected.<br />IDAP suffers from several technical issues.  The OSI reference model on p. 6 lists ARP as both a layer 4 (transport) and layer 3 (network) protocol.  In reality it assists layer 2 but, as it has an EtherType, it's ok to list at layer 3; layer 4 is wrong.  Page 7 says &quot;a NIDS system is usually inline on the network,&quot; but p. 8 says &quot;this is unlike IDS, which do not sit inline.&quot;  (NIDS are usually not inline; NIPS are.)  Page 34 says &quot;most useful packets will not fit into 68 bytes, so they may need to be fragmented anyway.&quot;  All three packets of the three-way handshake and all four of a graceful close can be less than 68 bytes, and they're certainly useful.<br />Pages 36-38 and 97 have multiple errors regarding TCP sequence numbers.  Readers familiar with my earlier reviews know these errors are repeated frequently.  For data portions of a session, the TCP sequence number is the sequence number of the first byte of application data in the packet.  The TCP acknowledgement number is the sequence number of the first byte of application data expected to be sent by the other party.<br />The sections I most anticipated were the chapters on products, but only the NFR material was genuinely helpful.  First, despite the book's title, the four products were mainly intrusion detection systems and not intrusion prevention systems.  RealSecure, Cisco Secure, Snort, and NFR were covered.  RealSecure offers IPS through Proventia, but its capabilities aren't discussed.  The Cisco chapter offers a few sentences on Okena, but where were chapters on NAI IntruShield (formerly from IntruVert) or Entercept?  Snort merits a chapter, but why is Sourcefire not mentioned?  I know everything can't appear, but a book called &quot;Intrusion Detection and Prevention&quot; should cover &quot;prevention&quot; products.<br />Of the four chapters on products, the NFR material was most useful.  I kept two questions important to all analysts in mind while reading: (1) How do I modify or create signatures? (2) How do I validate what the product reports?  Only the NFR chapter gave sufficient detail to answer question 1, and only the NFR chapter showed packet data to confirm a sample Code Red II alert.  This suggests the other products aren't capable, which may be true for ISS and Cisco; it's certainly *not* true for Snort, where modification and validation via packet detail are the heart of the product.<br />I also took exception to some of the authors' conclusions.  (Keep in mind a team wrote this book.)  A cheap shot on page 187 shows the ISS chapter author doesn't understand what real analysts need to &quot;trust&quot; their IDS: &quot;These increases in product signatures have given more customers the capability to trust the comprehensive nature of RealSecure over every other product, including the freeware power player, Snort.&quot;  Analyst trust is built on transparency and validation, meaning he can see why the product generated an alert, and use additional data to confirm its validity.  Snort and NFR offer this; ISS does not.  Furthermore, if you don't like how Snort works, you can modify the source code -- try that with a proprietary system.<br />On the positive side, I liked the buffer overflow coverage in chapter 4.  The Tcpdump chapter offered some intriguing string matching capabilities through nifty bit-shifting, but I think ngrep or even Snort are more practical.  A chapter on legal issues gives readers a helpful brief on federal laws and a listing of state cybercrime laws, but fails to mention exceptions to the wiretap act which permit traffic collection.<br /><br />I think IDAP left the presses beforeit was ready to live up to its name.  I expect the second edition to cover prevention adequately and to clean up the technical and philosophical issues identified here.fore it was ready to live up to its name.

US	49796397	R268U9LPA59LVE	0201734966	663392939	Understanding Open Source Software Development	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Open source software as seen by an &quot;independent&quot; third party	&quot;Understanding Open Source Software Development&quot; (UOSSD) is the perfect introduction to OSS for those outside the community.  The book takes a fairly balanced look at the people and processes which define the open source movement.  Although some aspects of the book have grown stale over the last three years, I still recommend UOSSD to those desiring a deeper look at the open source phenomenon.<br />One of the best aspects of UOSSD is its page count: at 180 pages of text, it's a fast read.  It still packs quite a punch, drawing upon and summarizing academic and non-fiction literature on OSS.  Prior to reading the book I was unaware of the idealogical battle between the Open Source Initiative and the Free Software Foundation.  These and other historical observations were invaluable.<br /><br />UOSSD is useful for those who want to leave the Microsoft-bashing aspects of the OSS bandwagon in search of a more meaningful role in the community.  By explaining the OSS community's dynamics, readers learn that a good way to contribute is to submit patches (p. 104).  Authors Feller and Fitzgerald explain that OSS has &quot;the highest payoff for software which requires a high degree of reliability&quot; (p. 135).  This is the heart of the security debate engulfing Microsoft.<br /><br />My only criticisms relate to the passage of time.  The book's &quot;acknowledgements&quot; are dated Oct 2001.  Unfortunately, a company analyzed in several locations, CoSource, appears to have had already gone out of business by then.  Late last year Red Hat left its &quot;pure play&quot; OSS role for &quot;RHEL.&quot;  Concerns over a lack of internationalization, particularly for languages, have been completely reversed; OpenOffice supports more languages than Microsoft Office.<br />Despite these drawbacks, UOSSD is a great book for techies and managers alike.  I'm adding it to my &quot;Management and Policy&quot; Listmania List today.	2004-01-05

Although the book is only 238 pages, it contains several gems.  I read the book specifically for its coverage of the Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG), OSU's Flow Tools, and Sysmon.  By following Kretchmar's instructions, I easily installed these three applications.<br />I was able to accomplish these tasks because OSNA is a &quot;cross platform&quot; book.  The author doesn't limit himself to discussing how to run the tool.  He gives guidance on how to configure Cisco routers to export NetFlow records or enable SNMP reporting.  Sometimes these simple steps are buried in Cisco's Web site, so I appreciated getting straight to business.  I literally had these tools running in a matter of minutes thanks to Kretchmar's instructions and the FreeBSD package system (e.g. &quot;pkg_add -r &lt;package&gt;&quot;).<br />On the down side I thought coverage of old stand-bys like tcpdump, traceroute, and netstat was unnecessary.  I would have liked reading about more &quot;niche&quot; tools like MTR.  If you like this book, keep an eye out for my &quot;Tao of Network Security Monitoring&quot; in the summer.  I'll take a similar approach in several chapters by discussing security-related network monitoring tools.	2003-12-26

This book is a 231 page political rant, regardless of the author's claim on p. 31 to be &quot;nonideological.&quot;  I have the slightly odd benefit of reading this book with a master's degree in public policy on the wall, but I work as a hands-on, FreeBSD-running computer security consultant.  I imagine many readers are also members of the technical community, yet are unaware of books addressing similar topics.  &quot;The Myth of Homeland Security&quot; cannot compare to a serious book like James Q. Wilson's &quot;Bureaucracy:  What Government Agencies Do and Why They Do It.&quot;  I'll tell you why and conclude with my rationale for 4 stars, nonetheless.<br />On p. xvi Ranum accurately reports &quot;I'm making some inflammatory observations.&quot;  True enough.  He repeatedly insults the media (p. 13), the FBI (pp. 22-23, 26, elsewhere), contractors, bureaucrats, pen testers -- you name it.  He continues: &quot;I don't want you, the reader, to ignore the substance of what I have to say by getting bogged down in the details of my research.  So I didn't quote sources.&quot;  Political Science 101: quote your sources.  Wilson gives 30 pages of endnotes to back up his arguments; Ranum gives zero.<br />Some of his arguments are completely illogical.  Ranum says on p. 3: &quot;conceiving a defense against a possible threat will automatically encourage someone to make that threat a reality.&quot;  Hmm, so if someone bullet-proofs his car window, an enemy is going to buy a gun which can't possibly damage the car?  You may disagree with me, but the following sentence (p. 4) shows Ranum doesn't know what he's talking about: &quot;The information warfare scare-hype gave birth to any number of organizations that build defensive information warfare capabilities -- as well as stimulating shadowy efforts to build offensive information weapons.&quot;<br />This shows Ranum has no insight regarding national info ops capabilities.  I served four years in info ops units in the Air Force.  I can't reveal what I know (Ranum's laughing, I'm sure), but I can say the author is clueless on this topic.  We get a confirming admission of this on p. 27: &quot;I don't know about the last few years, but as recently as 1996 I know the Pentagon's backbone network was un-firewalled.&quot;  1996?  Hint: my last unit was officially created in 1999-2000.  The world changes fast.<br />So why do I give &quot;The Myth&quot; 4 stars?  At least somebody is raising important issues.  Ranum may be the crazy guy yelling crude remarks at a quiet moment during a political rally, but thank goodness he's there.  It's great to see someone realize what a mess our appropriations process has become, and decide to join the fray.  Political scientists spend their entire lives chipping away at the same problems.  Welcome to the party, Mr. Ranum, and thanks for your work.rs in info ops units in the Air Force.  I can't reveal what I know (Ranum's laughing, I'm sure), but I can say the author is clueless on this topic.  We get a confirming admission of this on p. 27: &quot;I don't know about the last few years, but as recently as 1996 I know the Pentagon's backbone network was un-firewalled.&quot;  1996?  Hint: my last unit was officially created in 1999-2000.  The world changes fast.<br />So why do I give &quot;The Myth&quot; 4 stars?  At least somebody is raising important issues.  Ranum may be the crazy guy yelling crude remarks at a quiet moment during a political rally, but thank goodness he's there.  It's great to see someone realize what a mess our appropriations process has become, and decide to join the fray.  Political scientists spend their entire lives chipping away at the same problems.  Welcome to the party, Mr. Ranum, and thanks for your work.	2003-11-01

Books	4	115	189	N	N	Informative, but a bit muddled when using security terms	\\"Beyond Fear\\" is a good book, but don't turn to it for proper definitions of security terms.  Steer clear of this book's misuse of the words \\"threat\\" and \\"risk.\\"  While I appreciate Schneier's overall discussion of security issues, I expect a book aimed at the layman to be more accurate.<br />Schneier introduces the term \\"threat\\" on p. 20 with this example: \\"Most people don't give any thought to securing their lunch in the company refrigerator.  Even though there's a threat of theft, its not a significant risk because attacks are rare and the potential loss just isn't a big deal.  A rampant lunch thief in the company changes the equation; the threat remains the same, but the risk of theft increases.\\"  That's wrong; let's start with definitions (mine, based on intel experience -- not the author's).<br />A threat is a party with the capabilities and intentions to exploit a vulnerability in an asset.  A vulnerability is a weakness in an asset which could lead to exploitation.  Risk is the possibility of suffering harm or loss. It's a measure of danger.  All of these terms were defined years ago by military intel and law enforcement types, especially those doing counter-terrorism.<br />In the lunchroom example, nobody initially \\"secures\\" their lunch, even though their \\"assets\\" are held in a \\"vulnerable\\" (unlocked, unguarded) refrigerator.  Why?  There's no \\"threat\\" -- people have the capability to steal lunches but nobody has evil intentions.  \\"Risk\\" of losing one's lunch is close to zero.  Now, add the \\"rampant lunch thief.\\"  The threat is NOT \\"the same\\"; a threat now exists for the first time.  The risk equation changes -- risk of loss is much higher.  (Countermeasures like a guard can reduce the vulnerability and bring risk of loss closer to the original low level.)<br />Another example of fuzzy thinking appears on p. 50.  \\"Just because your home hasn't been broken into in decades doesn't mean that it's secure.\\"  Says who?  If the threat the entire time was zero, the house was always perfectly secure.  Vulnerabilities are but one part of the risk equation, which is Risk = Threat X Vulnerability X Cost of Asset.  If any factor is zero, risk is zero.<br />One quick final example appears on p. 238: \\"The problem lies in the fact that the threat -- the potential damage -- is enormous.\\"  Wrong!  A threat is an agent, or party, who wants to and can inflict damage.  \\"Threat\\" in this sentence should be \\"cost,\\" meaning the replacement value of the assets at risk.<br />A hint to the source of these errors appears on p. 82: \\"examining an asset and trying to imagine all the possible threats against that asset is sometimes called 'threat analysis' or 'risk analysis.' (The terms are not well defined in the security business, and they tend to be used interchangeably.)\\"  Which security business?  Counter-terrorism and intel folks know threat analysis is performed against groups with capabilities and intentions to harm American assets.  Risk analysis calculates the potential for loss given a certain threat, an asset's vulnerabilities, and the value of that asset.  It's the digital security community that's obscuring the definitions.<br />I loved \\"Secrets and Lies,\\" and every time I see the author speak I learn something new.  Am I off base with this review?  You be the judge.  I still gave it 4 stars, since the book's vignettes are informative and its scope impressive.  Given the large number of reviewers I expected someone to challenge the author's terminology.  Yes, this is semantics, but shouldn't a book by an expert set the record straight?  I don't think my expectations are unrealistic, either; Schneier is a previously published \\"thought leader,\\" and he deserves to be held to the highest possible standards.house was always perfectly secure.

US	49796397	RICS64QB4JNEB	0672322226	489397066	C Primer Plus (4th Edition)	Books	5	11	12	N	Y	A great start for new C programmers	Stephen Prata's \\"C Primer Plus, 4th Ed\\" (CPP4E) is an excellent book.  I took a close look at the competition and even started reading O'Reilly's \\"Practical C Programming\\" before realizing CPP4E was the book for me.  I had no C programming background, but had the knowledge of C-64 BASIC, Pascal, and other languages shared by many kids born in the 1970s.  If you're looking for a well-conceived introduction to C, Prata's book is for you.<br />CPP4E impresses the reader on many levels.  First, Prata's writing is exceptionally clear.  He doesn't require you to dissect that one \\"key sentence\\" which encapsulates all the author has to say on a single topic.  Prata defines all of his terms, uses them in examples, and reintroduces them when later new ideas require background presented earlier.<br />Second, CPP4E is a \\"teach yourself\\" manual.  If you read the text, type in the examples, answer the review questions, and try at least some of the programming exercises, you will learn something.  I typed many of the examples in the book by hand and also made use of the code supplied on the publisher's Web site. CPP4E should be used in classes as an introductory C book.<br />Third, it's evident a lot of thought and work went into publishing CPP4E.  The index is thorough and applicable.  The arrangement of topics makes sense.  The diagrams are easy to decipher.  The errata available on the publisher's Web site is comprehensive.  I did find a few minor issues and submitted those to SAMS, which they acknowledged.<br />My only concern is the author's differentiation between \\"serious code\\" and \\"more relaxed programming.\\"  He says on p. 410 \\"in serious programming, you should use fgets() rather than gets(), but this book takes a more relaxed approach.\\"  Unfortunately, this relaxed approach is the reason why computers are constantly compromised.  By now programmers should realize that users deploy their code in the most hostile of environments, and intruders will blow away anything that's not bullet proof.  While Prata does show readers how to take more secure approaches, I'd like to see a security theme consistently applied throughout the fifth edition.<br />Overall, I strongly recommend CPP4E to anyone interested in an introduction to C.  If you're looking for network programming, however, you won't find it here.  Keep an eye on future reviews of mine for my picks on a socket programming guide.  Keep in mind when reading this review that I'm a beginning C programmer.  I'm not in a position to judge the author's style.  However, I doubt many experienced programmers would read this entire book!'s not bullet proof.

US	49796397	R2RDZBFYE41NA2	1578701856	731657946	Intrusion Detection	Books	5	7	8	N	N	The most underappreciated intrusion detection book available	Three years ago, as a captain in the Air Force CERT, I didn't think I had time to read books on theory and definitions like Rebecca Bace's &quot;Intrusion Detection.&quot;  If a book didn't show  packet captures, I didn't need it!  Fast forward to 2003, as I research intrusion detection history and re-discover Bace's contribution to the field.  Now, I consider her book so important that I consider most of it mandatory preparation for my own book.  If you've got the time for &quot;high level&quot; monitoring concerns, check out &quot;Intrusion Detection.&quot;<br />As a researcher, my favorite aspect of the book is Bace's readiness to &quot;lay down the law&quot; and provide numerous definitions for intrusion detection concepts.  Most of them are so clear as to be considered definitive in my eyes.  Like Paul Proctor's 2001 title &quot;The Practical Intrusion Detection Handbook,&quot; I get the sense that Bace &quot;gets it.&quot;  She doesn't show packet traces, but what she says makes sense.<br />The best aspect of the book, for my purposes, is its historical nature.  Bace covers several decades of intrusion detection concepts and products.  She cites the players and their papers, and the themes prevalent as IDS moved from the lab to the front lines.  I also found the legal issues chapter extremely valuable.  IDS operators should know their products implement wiretaps or trap and trace/pen registers, for which legal cover should be sought.  The legal chapter also featured two great case studies on capturing Kevin Mitnick and responding to the 1994 Rome Labs intrusion.<br /><br />On the negative side, I offer a few disagreements and suggestions.  First, vulnerability assessment products are not &quot;a special case of intrusion detection&quot; (ch. 6).  This association clouds the issue and confuses the layman.  Vulnerability assessment products identify vulnerabilities.  Intrusion detection products identify threats.  VA can work with IDS in an overall risk management strategy, or to provide context to improve IDS detection methods (e.g. Sourcefire RNA or Tenable NeVO), but VA is not IDS.  I also disagree the a primary goal of IDS is real-time response.  While this is a goal for science fiction writers, I still don't trust the removal of the human operator.  Minor points include a lack of discussing Snort (created in 1998, popular by 1999) and an incorrect claim regarding &quot;NSM&quot; on p. 19 -- the acronym means &quot;Network Security Monitor.&quot;<br />If you're looking for background on the history and purpose of IDS, I strongly recommend reading &quot;Intrusion Detection.&quot;  It's as relevant today as it was three years ago.

I still think &quot;Incident Response and Computer Forensics, 2nd Edition&quot; (IRCF2E) is the best forensics book on the market.  Notice I said &quot;forensics.&quot;  It's significant that the first edition's title was &quot;Incident Response: Investigating Computer Crime.&quot;  While IRCF2E contains plenty of IR material, I sense a shift away from computer security and towards the legal world in this second edition.<br /><br />Readers of the first edition will want to know what's new.  While reading IRCF2E I thumbed through the first edition and make some notes.  The following chapters appear mostly or totally new: 1 (Real-World Incidents), 3 (Preparing for Incident Response), 4 (After Detection of an Incident), 9 (Evidence Handling), 10 (Computer System Storage Fundamentals), 11 (Data Analysis Techniques), 17 (Writing Computer Forensics Reports).  Some chapters contain rewrites or new material: 2 (Intro to the IR Process), 5 (Live Data Collection from Windows), 6 (Live Data Collection from UNIX), 7 (Forensic Duplication), 8 (Collecting Network-based Evidence), and 14 (Analyzing Network Traffic).  The remainder received minor rewrites.  Some chapters from the first edition on IIS and application forensics were integrated elsewhere.<br /><br />The most informative sections for me, as a reader of both editions, appear in chapters 7, 10, and 17.  Chapter 7 lays down the law on differences between a &quot;forensic duplication,&quot; a &quot;qualified forensic duplication,&quot; and a &quot;mirror image.&quot;  Expert witnesses can turn to IRCF2E as a standard when testifying, thanks to this chapter's clarity and citations of &quot;Daubert&quot; and &quot;Kumho.&quot;  Chapter 10 nicely explains file systems and storage layers.  Chapter 17 gives desperately needed guidance on writing forensics reports -- the part of an engagement the client really wants.<br />I found a few errata items, such as p. 61's reference to the PPA; it should be &quot;Privacy Protection Act.&quot;  On pp. 97-98, all of the &quot;ps&quot; tools should list the Sysinternals home page, not Foundstone.  Despite my contribution of material to the network-oriented chapters of IRCF2E, don't believe that I advocate using laptops for monitoring duties (p. 179).  Laptops and especially their NIC drivers are not built for packet capture in high speed environments.<br />IRCF2E is one of the few books in print where the word &quot;forensics&quot; deserves to be on the cover.  Many prominent &quot;forensics&quot; titles deliver nothing useful to practitioners.  As was the case with the first edition, investigators can use IRCF2E in operational environments to do real work.  This book lays much of the groundwork for doing cases.

US	49796397	R1CE384L9QRUGG	0072225157	901480288	SQL Server Security	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Chip Andrews and crew deliver a title worthy of its lineage	&quot;SQL Server Security&quot; (SSS) is a great security book, free of the bloat the affects both operating systems and many technical volumes.  Weighing in at 322 pages, it's packed with the detail needed to securely deploy Microsoft SQL servers.  Although many people contributed to the text, it doesn't suffer from internal redundancy.  I highly recommend anyone operating SQL servers devour this book.<br />In the &quot;Acknowledgements,&quot; lead author Chip Andrews writes &quot;I wanted this book to give security and database professionals the same readability, reference ability, and red-eyed wonder that 'Hacking Exposed' gave me a few years back.&quot;  My favorite aspect of the HE line was the material's ability to explain attack and defense concepts while illuminating the internal operation of victimized systems.  SSS follows this lead by devoting entire chapters to SQL Server components, like Network-Libraries (ch. 4) and Authentication and Authorization (ch. 5).  My favorite sections appear in chapter 7, where the authors describe novel ways to leverage SQL Server's &quot;C-2 auditing&quot; features for purposes of intrusion detection.<br /><br />SSS dispenses an immense amount of useful advice, whether it's a whole chapter on secure installation (ch. 3), best practices found in most chapters, or the appendices on stored procedures and integration with other Microsoft technologies.  The only downside I found appears in chapter 2, where SQL samurai David Litchfield uses language outside the realm of most readers' understanding.  For example, &quot;the import address entry for GetProcAddress() in sqlsort.dll shifts by 12.  With no SQL Server service pack, the address of the entry is at 0x42AE1010, and on SP1 and SP2, it is at 0x42AE101C&quot; (p. 29).  The uninitiated should skim this chapter and trust the authors when they claim SQL Server can be attacked by multiple means.<br /><br />SSS is a must-buy if you operate SQL Server.  It's the manual Microsoft forgot to ship.o ship.	2003-10-12
US	49796397	R34Z7NPRMC8RKV	0750676132	470591982	Investigative Data Mining for Security and Criminal Detection	Books	4	14	14	N	N	When on-message, an excellent intro to data mining	I read \\"Investigative Data Mining for Security and Criminal Detection\\" (IDM) after attending the 2003 Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID) conference.  Researchers at RAID mentioned \\"self-organizing maps,\\" \\"neural networks,\\" \\"machine learning,\\" and other unfamiliar topics.  Mena's book helped me understand these subjects in the context of performing data mining.  If you steer clear of the author's discussion of intrusion detection in chapter 10, you'll find IDM enlightening and a little scary.<br /><br />Author Jesus Mena defines investigative data mining as \\"the visualization, organization, sorting, clustering, segmenting, and predicting of criminal behavior\\" (p.1).  His book strays from this definition, as he also covers simply discovering patterns of activity for responding to events.  Accomplishing this task requires investigative data warehousing, link analysis, software agents, text mining, neural networks, and machine learning.  Mena addresses each technique in its own chapter, offering descriptions, case studies, and tools.  Two types of data mining analysis exist: descriptive, such as a chart, graph, or decision tree; and predictive, obtained via neural networks and machine learning (p.261).  Mena also describes mining via \\"top-down\\" vs \\"bottom-up\\" approaches.  The first involves an analyst exploring data to support his theories.  The second relies on software to find patterns in data not imagined by a human analyst (p.343).<br /><br />Mena is most effective when he writes about what he knows best.  I loved chapter 9, where he explains cell phone, insurance, and financial frauds.  Much of what he wrote applied directly to my interest in network security monitoring and intrusion detection.  Chapter 10 (Intrusion Detection), however, is best ignored.  Mena does not appear to understand computer security, and neither do his editors.  He calls Snort a \\"freeware site-based system IDS,\\" in contrast with \\"network-based IDSs such as RealSecure\\" (p.306).  He labels tcpdump an \\"attack\\" tool and says \\"this is utility for eavesdropping for passwords\\" (his typos) (p.307) and describes \\"rhosts\\" in a \\"stealth\\" attack phase as \\"this utility will evaluate hosts and lists hosts and users who are trusted by the local host\\" (p.308).  Mena isn't a \\"security guy,\\" either; he lumps \\"threats and vulnerabilities\\" together as \\"weaknesses or flaws in a system, such as a hole in security or a back door\\" (p.14).  A threat is one or more entities with capabilities and intentions sufficient to exploit vulnerabilities in information resources, while a vulnerability is a weakness in design, configuration, or deployment which allow threats to abuse, subvert, or break information resources.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed IDM.  Mena makes numerous fascinating insights.  While his prose is somewhat repetitive, he explains the key points needed to get data mining newbies up to speed.  In light of the recent revelations of jetBlue sharing data with the government, the techniques Mena describes are both powerful and disturbing.ls tcpdump an \\"attack\\" tool and says \\"this is utility for eavesdropping for passwords\\" (his typos) (p.307) and describes \\"rhosts\\" in a \\"stealth\\" attack phase as \\"this utility will evaluate hosts and lists hosts and users who are trusted by the local host\\" (p.308).

They help me understand protocols I see on the wire, usually using case studies that are far more exciting than reading dry Request For Comment (RFC) documents.  &quot;TCP/IP Analysis and Troubleshooting Toolkit&quot; (TAATT) isn't a &quot;tool&quot; book like Wiley's &quot;Network Performance Open Source Toolkit.&quot;  Rather, TAATT tries to explain the operations of many popular protocols.  It does a fairly good job, and deserves a look.<br />TAATT's best material appears in ch. 8, &quot;Microsoft-Related Protocols.&quot;  While it makes little sense to include DHCP in this chapter (DHCP isn't used exclusively by Microsoft), the explanations of NetBIOS and Server Message Block (SMB) are helpful.  The author explains the right aspects of NetBIOS and SMB and leaves the rest to other sources.  (Two new books merit mention -- &quot;Implementing CIFS: The Common Internet File System&quot; and &quot;The Official Samba 3 How-To and Reference Guide.&quot;)  I also enjoyed case studies on firewalls offering artificial MAC addresses in ch. 3 and descriptions of &quot;hidden master&quot; DNS servers in ch. 7.<br />On the down side, the book has a handful of typos, plus a major error in ch. 7 regarding active vs. passive FTP modes.  Page 271 states &quot;the PASV command allows you to use what is called a passive file transfer, whereby the client initiates the port 20 connection to the server... In Frame 23, you see the server responding with the port and IP address pair for the client to use in making its port 20 connection to the server.&quot;  This is false; the traffic trace shows the passive data transfer comes from port 2392 TCP on the client to port 4293 on the server.  This may not seem like a big deal, but this is a book explaining how protocols work!<br /><br />Overall, I liked TAATT.  I found the Shockwave videos and tracefiles posted to the publisher's web site to be good references, although not all traces discussed in the book are reproduced on the Web.  Along with Haugdahl's &quot;Network Analysis and Troubleshooting&quot; and Bardwell/Oppenheimer's &quot;Troubleshooting Campus Networks,&quot; you should get a good sense of how many popular protocols operate.  Note all three books tend to sidestep the use of port 445 TCP to offer SMB directly over TCP, concentrating on SMB over NetBIOS over port 139 TCP.  Everyone still talks about primary and backup domain controllers, although Windows 2000 uses Active Directory with all domain controllers being &quot;primaries.&quot;  Windows 2000 prefers port 445 TCP, but no one shows traces of its activities.

I prefer &quot;getting to the point&quot; and telling me what works and what doesn't. R8S changed my mind. The book's lively style helped me survive fairly heavy discussion of cryptography and implementation of security protocols. The authors remarkable clarity and insights reminded me of Ross Anderson's &quot;Security Engineering,&quot; a book I respect highly. I finished R8S with a better idea of the future of wireless security and how to secure existing wireless deployments.<br />The book contains three major parts. The first part gives background of wireless technology and explains why WEP is broken. The next major section discusses the future of wireless security, 802.11i, with the &quot;Robust Security Network&quot; (RSN) as the ultimate goal and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) as a subset option for the present. 802.1x port-based access control is covered along with TKIP or AES-CCMP. The authors help readers understand how dial-up or wired technologies like RADIUS have been extended to support 802.11i. The final part of the book talks about attacks and concludes with an open-source implementation of a wireless access point, FreeRADIUS, and other elements.<br />R8S may in parts appear to be a book for designers (as the authors claim on p. 245) but implementers will find it useful. The authors have great teaching skills and offer useful analogies to explain the inner workings of wireless security. At times I felt the authors sounded a bit like &quot;sheltered academics,&quot; stating on page 25 &quot;in reality, attacking for profit is probably not that common.&quot; (They haven't dealt with organized crime on the Internet, I guess!) Their mention of &quot;ego attackers&quot; as the top of the intruder food chain seemed naive as well. Nevertheless, this outlook didn't affect the authors' ability to deliver solid security information.<br />This book could be considered the definitive guide to the future of wireless security. This isn't a book on how to break into wireless networks. It's about how wireless security failed in the past and what has been done to address those shortcomings. If you really want the scoop on 802.11i, give R8S a shot.information.<br />This book could be considered the definitive guide to the future of wireless security.

US	49796397	R3GQNYHEET5S49	0471433012	176894011	Network Performance Toolkit: Using Open Source Testing Tools	Books	5	12	12	N	N	A great tool-oriented tour of network troubleshooting	I don't have a lot to say about &quot;Network Performance Open Source Toolkit&quot; (NPOST), other than I think it's excellent.  We need more tool-oriented books to teach admins how to do real work on their networks.  NPOST delivers chapter after chapter of practical, hands-on material applicable to the networking shop in any organization.<br /><br />NPOST shines in three respects.  First, the author ensures readers can properly install each tool he discusses.  When dealing with open source tools, installation cannot be taken for granted.  (The exception is using the FreeBSD operating system's &quot;ports tree,&quot; which almost guarantees easy installation of any tool listed in the system.)  Second, the author walks readers through the use of each tool, explaining what it does and how to best deploy it.  Finally, readers are given mini-case studies demonstrating the use of each tool to solve real-world problems.  This is just the sort of approach which helps readers understand the differences between network simulators and emulators, for example.<br /><br />I found only a few minor issues.  When providing command-line tcpdump options on pages 230 and 234, I believe the author should have passed a '-s 1514' option to change the default 68-byte snaplength to something more reasonable.  I felt the FreeBSD kernel configuration advice in chapter 14 was insufficient, and didn't specify whether it applied to 4.x or 5.x FreeBSD systems.  Last, the author's tcpdump command line for capturing FTP sessions on p. 230 will only capture &quot;active&quot; FTP sessions using port 20 TCP.  It will miss any passive FTP data channels.<br />In summary, I give NPOST two thumbs up.  Since so many other open source networking tools are available, perhaps we'll see a second volume?	2003-09-13

I was pleasantly surprised to see an old version of a paper I had written several years ago cited in the bibliography, and the table of contents seemed to mention all the right subjects.  I hadn't heard any &quot;buzz&quot; about this book, but I thought I might have found a hidden gem.  I should have left the book on the shelf!<br /><br />The first aspect of PYIWID that strikes the reader is the awkward English.  The author appears to be Russian, and his editors gave him little support.  Many times where the word &quot;block&quot; should be used, &quot;lock&quot; appears!  For example: &quot;Most network devices and programs lock ICMP packets and do not pass them&quot; (p. 55).  &quot;If you detect an attack and start trying to lock it with firewalls...&quot; (p. 60).  These were followed on p. 84 by mentions of &quot;Red Code&quot; and &quot;Blue Code,&quot; instead of &quot;Code Red.&quot;  Other sections make questionable, if not totally false, claims.  For example: &quot;Agent installation is especially dangerous for open systems, such as Linux and OpenBSD, since the agent can be introduced into the OS kernel.&quot;  Ever hear of kernel mode Windows rootkits?<br /><br />Other quotes just make no sense, such as first describing hiding processes on p. 62 and then saying &quot;Using the rootkit or SunOS represents an example of this method.&quot;  I was sad to read that &quot;the White House server was blocked for tree hours and, on May 22, the server was unavailable for six hours.&quot;  (p. 42).  Some material indicated fuzzy thinking using sweeping statements, such as &quot;Intrusion detection systems can identify and block practically all propagation methods used by hybrid attacks&quot; (p. 49).  The author seems to think math will solve your problems; this quote was outrageous: &quot;Since intrusion detection technologies still lack a solid mathematical foundation, there is no possibility of developing efficient methods of detecting attacks and efficiently counteracting them.&quot;  The author also thinks vulnerability assessment products are intrusion detection systems, covering scanners and such in ch. 6.<br /><br />On the positive side, I think PYIWID has a great bibliography.  It mentions lots of useful papers, some of which are mentioned in the book.  I also liked the TAP diagram on p. 369.  I initially thought the inclusion of various security &quot;was stories&quot; was useful, until I realized they appeared at random times and were often uncited.  The exception was the heavy reliance on stories from books by Vacca.  I was sad to see the author mainly relied on other people's packet traces for this book!  &quot;Most of the listing examples provided in this and subsequent sections were taken from [the SANS Internet Storm Center], or are based on practical exercises performed within the framework of preparing for [GIAC certification]&quot; (p. 96&quot;.<br />It was my fault that I bought this book.  I should have been tipped off by the odd choice of &quot;key points&quot; on the cover: &quot;describing firewalls, indicating security policy violations, analyzing the information sources, improving the IDS security level.&quot;  These sound awkward, and PYIWID follows that theme throughout.  I give it three stars because the author did a lot of working bringing disparate sources of information together in this single volume, but he did not present it coherently.lack a solid mathematical foundation, there is no possibility of developing efficient methods of detecting attacks and efficiently counteracting them.&quot;  The author also thinks vulnerability assessment products are intrusion detection systems, covering scanners and such in ch. 6.  <BR> <BR>On the positive side, I think PYIWID has a great bibliography.

To test the book's relevance I bought an OpenBSD 3.3 CD-ROM set and installed it, following Lucas' directions.  I tried many of the procedures in the book, and found Lucas' instructions to be accurate on the whole.  (Right now I'm rebuilding a system to incorporate a security patch that needs certain static binaries to be recompiled from source.)<br /><br />Lucas provides the background and skills needed to get a working OpenBSD system.  Although some of the most basic UNIX-type material appears by necessity in both &quot;Absolute&quot; books (these are both BSDs!), Lucas knows where each OS' strength lies.  In his FreeBSD book, he spends more time on general purpose server services.  Web, FTP, email, DNS, etc. all get their own chapters.  In this OpenBSD book, Lucas devotes multiple chapters to topics that matter most to OpenBSD users -- security and packet filtering.  While lots of people run Web, etc. on OpenBSD platforms, OpenBSD offers unique features in its systrace system call access control and PF packet filtering tools.  Beyond these OpenBSD strengths, Lucas gives plenty of coverage to the routine yet crucial system administration tasks of adding and removing applications, and upgrading and patching the OS itself.<br /><br />On the downside, some have commented on &quot;rough editing.&quot;  While the book has some typos, I didn't find them all that distracting.  Beware p. 344, though -- I think &quot;tag=OPENBSD3_2&quot; should read &quot;tag=OPENBSD_3_2&quot;.  (This is subtle but could be important.)  I also found the description of network layers in ch 8 to be perplexing.  Why talk about &quot;application, logical protocol, physical protocol,  and physical layer&quot; when no one else does?  I would also have liked to have read of OpenBSD's use as a bridging firewall or as a VPN concentrator.<br /><br />The bottom line is this: Michael Lucas knows what to write to help system administrators get the job done.  I wish other authors did the same.  I'd love to see Lucas or another &quot;No Starch&quot; author write &quot;Absolute Cisco Routers,&quot; followed by &quot;Absolute Cisco Switches.&quot;  Any takers?r as a VPN concentrator.<BR> <BR>The bottom line is this: Michael Lucas knows what to write to help system administrators get the job done.

I can't say which book is better, and I recommend you buy Lucas' book as well as this one.  TCF:4E remains for me the FreeBSD user's manual; any serious FreeBSD user will have it on his or her shelf.  The two books complement each other, as Lucas is often more direct in his explanations.<BR> <BR>While in some places I find Lucas' material easier to follow, Lehey offers depth of coverage not found elsewhere.  For example, Lehey devotes the entirety of ch. 28 to low-level discussions of configuring and troubleshooting XFree86, whereas Lucas offers a few pages.  (Urban and Tiemann's &quot;FreeBSD Unleashed&quot; talks about configuring X too.)<br />Lucas' &quot;Absolute BSD&quot; focuses solely on FreeBSD.  The only &quot;straying&quot; involves mentioning applications which run on FreeBSD.  As apps like Apache and Postfix make systems useful, this makes sense.  Lehey's TCF:4E is less concentrated, as it discusses intricacies of hardware, questions to ask ISPs before signing contracts, and principles of network troubleshooting.  While I probably don't need to read such topics in a book I bought (yes, bought) for FreeBSD coverage, I didn't mind these &quot;diversions.&quot;  &quot;Grog&quot; Lehey has been around so long his insights are truly valuable.  Lehey also presents a very traditional BSD usage model, where admins check their email using &quot;mutt&quot; (ch. 26) and avoid &quot;Standard&quot; installations in favor of &quot;Custom&quot; installations.  I found this approach useful.<BR> <BR>Since TCF:4E is advertised as covering version 5.0, I hoped to see some introductory material on items brought from Robert Watson's &quot;TrustedBSD&quot; project.  These were &quot;experimental&quot; in FreeBSD 5.0, but could change the way FreeBSD systems are administered.  Overall, security didn't get as much attention in Lehey's book compared to Lucas'.  For example, Lucas walked readers through deploying a jail, while Lehey doesn't mention the subject.  I also found the chapter on Vinum confusing.  Since Lehey created Vinum, he may need someone to step back and describe the system in layman's terms.  <BR> <BR>Overall, TCF:4E is a must-buy.  I already referred to it over the weekend when installing a new FreeBSD gateway, and I expect to consult it repeatedly in the future.	2003-08-13

Since then I've joined Foundstone and contributed the case study on pages 2-7 in \\"Hacking Exposed: 4th Ed\\" (HE:4E), on a non-royalty basis.  Since my review could still be seen as being biased, I'll mainly discuss changes between HE:3E and HE:4E.<br /><br />The most noticeable change is the reorganization of the Windows-specific chapters.  HE:3E had one 25 page chapter on 9x/ME/XP and two chapters with 172 pages on NT and 2000.  HE:4E offers one 22 page chapter on 9x/ME and one 66 page chapter on the \\"NT family.\\"  The authors wisely direct readers to \\"Hacking Exposed: Windows 2000\\" and \\"Hacking Exposed: Web Applications\\" for more in-depth discussions of attacking Windows.  The material in HE:4E is still sufficient to compromise Windows boxes without having to open HE:W2K or HE:WA.  This decision allowed HE:4E to grow by only 2 pages since HE:3E.  (I criticized HE:3E with a four star review for including too much material best left in topic-specific HE editions.)  Pruning the Windows material allows room for a stand-alone wireless hacking chapter in the nitty-gritty HE style, as well as other improvements.<br /><br />Another major addition to HE:4E is a completely rewritten enumeration chapter.  While HE:3E compartmentalized techniques by operating system (Windows, Novell, UNIX), HE:4E offers port-based techniques.  For example, if port 179 is open, try BGP-based queries.  If port 524 is open or IPX is in use, try Novell attacks.  This approach reflects the methods used by assessors who find listening services, and can't be sure what OS is present.  The chapter on network devices (ch 9) offers exceptionally devious hacking tricks, such as performing a T-1 \\"man-in-the-middle\\" attack.<br /><br />HE:3E represents a significant upgrade from HE:3E, with nearly two years between the two books.  I wasn't happy with the changes between HE:2E and HE:3E, as both were published in 2001.  I would like to see HE:5E add a single chapter on attacking Cisco routers, with discussions of the overflows, tunnels, and remote sniffing pioneered by Phenoelit's FX.  A chapter on attacking embedded devices and PDAs would be helpful.  I recommend following the lead of frequently-updated hardware books like Scott Mueller's \\"Upgrading and Repairing PCs\\": print the latest and greatest, and archive the rest to CD-ROM.  I think the chapters on Win 9x/ME and Novell could make way for more exciting discussions in HE:5E.  Along with Ed Skoudis' \\"Counter Hack,\\" HE:4E is one of the books I recommend as absolutely essential reading for all security professionals.e HE:5E add a single chapter on attacking Cisco routers, with discussions of the overflows, tunnels, and remote sniffing pioneered by Phenoelit's FX.

US	49796397	RMDP06PG1MBXM	0131014153	344826483	Linux on the Mainframe	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Innovative, accessible, and visionary	&quot;Server consolidation&quot; is the latest buzzword for downsized IT staffs.  Many believe this means reducing the number of Windows servers running on Intel hardware.  &quot;Linux on the Mainframe,&quot; (LOTM) written by experts from IBM, offer an alternative: virtualization on the IBM zSeries and S/390 mainframes.  Virtualization is the process of running dozens or hundreds of operating system &quot;images,&quot; each of which thinks it is running on dedicated hardware.  LOTM explains the improvements in reliability, availability, and serviceability from implementing this sort of system.<br /><br />LOTM doesn't assume the reader has mainframe experience.  (It doesn't assume that much Linux experience, either.)  As a result, the book provides the background to understand differences between PC and mainframe architectures and designs.  LOTM frequently refers to two sample deployments (StoreCompany and ISPCompany) to show how mainframe technology can be deployed vertically (to mainly support individual applications) or horizontally (to clone similar systems).  LOTM gets its point across using numerous diagrams and tables, each clearly showing the concept behind running multiple Linux servers and network devices on a single mainframe hardware platform.  LOTM also offers a glossary to help mainframe newbies learn that &quot;storage&quot; in mainframe lingo equals &quot;memory&quot; or &quot;RAM&quot; on the PC.  Those that find the first two-thirds of the book too light on detail will enjoy the last one-third, where technicalities like the PSW and mainframe registers are explained.<br /><br />LOTM is a book which explains IBM's image of computing as an &quot;on-demand utility,&quot; like electricity.  This seems to be the only way to protect and maintain systems whose operators cannot defend themselves.  Although LOTM at times reads like an IBM commercial, I bought into the book's thesis.  It is impressive to consider an entire ISP architecture (servers, routers, etc.) running within a single mainframe.  I recommend anyone trying to understand the latest server deployment trends read LOTM.  While you may not plan to deploy this arrangement, it will definitely affect IT in the years ahead.  Expect Microsoft and Sun to continue to compete in this space as well.running within a single mainframe.  I recommend anyone trying to understand the latest server deployment trends read LOTM.

The first was Tim Crothers' \\"Implementing Intrusion Detection Systems\\" (4 stars).  I was disappointed by IDWS, since I have a high opinion of Prentice Hall and the new \\"Bruce Perens' Open Source Series.\\"  (I'm looking forward to the book on CIFS, for example.)  IDWS read poorly and doesn't deliver as much useful content as the competing Syngress book \\"Snort 2.0.\\"<br /><br />The most difficult aspect of reading IDWS is the author's grammar, particularly his avoidance of using definitive articles like \\"the\\", and other important words.  For instance, p. 3 says \\"Apache web server takes help from ACID, etc.\\"  p. 133 claims \\"However, if you are using HTTP decode preprocessor, this attempt can detected.\\"  Beyond grammar, the author demonstrates weak knowledge of the IDS field, stating on p. 1 \\"Intrusion detection methods starting appearing in the last few years.\\"  James Anderson led the way in 1980, followed by Denning and Neumann in 1983 and Todd Heberlein in 1990!  The author also repeatedly compares IDS to anti-virus signatures, which is simplistic and incorrect.<br /><br />Technical errors further hamper IDWS.  p. 89 makes the mistake of saying TCP sequence numbers count packets; they really count bytes of application data.  p. 96-97 confuses the use of standard Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) with their use in Snort, which is different.  (SF+ means SYN and FIN and zero or more other flags, not SYN AND FIN alone.)  The fuzzy diagrams don't appear professional, and acronyms like \\"PHP\\" are defined incorrectly as \\"Pretty Home Page\\" (rather than the self-referencing \\"PHP Hypertext Processor.\\")<br /><br />Coverage of important topics is lacking or outdated.  First, Snort 1.9 is the basis for the text. However, 2.0 is available and covered by the Syngress book. The output system Barnyard and unified logging receive a total of one page.  No meaningful mention is made of the effects of collecting traffic via hub, SPAN port, or tap.  The port list on pp. 87-88 shows \\"well known ports,\\" but doesn't say if they are TCP or UDP.  The author makes odd claims about Snort \\"not [being] able to analyze application layer protocols,\\" which is misleading.  Snort rules aren't designed specifically for HTTP, for example, but they can be used to inspect HTTP requests and responses.<br /><br />My favorite part of IDWS was the coverage of using the MySQL database.  Appendix B provides helpful supplemental material on this subject also.  Bottom line: I would pass on IDWS but keep an eye on the other titles in the PHPTR \\"Open Source Series.\\"mention is made of the effects of collecting traffic via hub, SPAN port, or tap.

Thanks to the technical knowledge of the author team, &quot;Snort 2.0&quot; earns the reader's appreciation by explaining how and why the open source Snort IDS works its magic.<br /><br />&quot;Snort 2.0&quot; starts well with a short history of Marty Roesch's favorite project, followed by solid explanations of the key elements of Snort's architecture in ch. 2.  The actual workings of the Snort code is expanded upon in ch. 4 (modes), 5 (rules), and 6 (packet handling and preprocessors).  One could read these sections and get a real sense of how the stream4 preprocessor works, for example.  These sections are augmented by helpful tangents on compiling source code (ch. 3) and updates via CVS (ch. 9).  This attention to detail and desire to include related information demonstrates a high level of commitment to the reader's education.<br /><br />&quot;Snort 2.0&quot; has several technical errors or typos which prevented me from giving a 5 star review.  p. 110's diagram of a TCP sessions should say &quot;SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK&quot;, not &quot;SYN, ACK, SYN-ACK&quot;.  Later on that page, the author claims &quot;The server replies with a SYN/ACK if the port is open, and a SYN/RST if the port is not listening.&quot;  The correct closed response is &quot;RST/ACK&quot;.  p. 203 implies one can scan for open ports with the ACK flag set to evade stateless packet filters.  This is wrong, as scanning with the ACK flag set only helps host discovery.  I found the reprinting of multiple pages of C code unnecessary.  I also wished the sections on building preprocessors had started from scratch, rather than explain an existing preprocessor.<br /><br />Overall, I found &quot;Snort 2.0&quot; enlightening.  The authors have a powerful understanding of the workings of Snort, and apply it in novel ways.  &quot;Policy-based IDS&quot; in ch. 12 is one example, while the &quot;rule categorization&quot; chart in ch. 10 is another.

The book does a good job of explaining many of the key concepts needed to get real work done on UNIX systems.  While readers with advanced backgrounds will prefer a book like &quot;Mastering UNIX Shell Scripting&quot; by Randal Michael, USP3E will please most UNIX scripting newbies.<br /><br />USP3E begins with a review of the basics -- working with files and directories, redirecting input/output, pipes, and the shell itself.  Chapter four's discussion of regular expressions is generally useful, although &quot;saving matched characters&quot; on p. 64 was confusing.  This made the &quot;command substitution&quot; material on p. 129 unclear.  Chapter six was devoted to the use of different sorts of quotes, which seems excessive until one realizes the significant differences between using single and double quotation marks in scripts.  Attention to detail like this, along with generous inclusion of sample scripts, helped this book earn a strong rating.<br /><br />While the book includes examples of using sed, awk is not mentioned.  Sed could have received more coverage as well.  While the authors direct interested readers to other books, perhaps a future edition might include chapters devoted to sed and awk?  While the publisher's site doesn't mention a source for errata, it is available by contacting the authors.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this book.  It is up-to-date and compares favorably to the other books I consider reading to learn more about UNIX shell scripting.  Armed with the knowledge gained from USP3E, readers should be equipped to automate some routine tasks.  They will also be able to progress to more advanced shell scripting resources.	2003-05-24

STN is similar to the \\"Hacker's Challenge\\" books published by Osborne, although the stories are not separated into evidence and resolution sections.  Rather, a collection of authors use mildly fictional tales to introduce readers to tactics and techniques used by black and white hat hackers.<br />My favorite chapter was written by FX of Phenoelit, where a female black hat battles white hat defenders.  The playing field includes HP printers, GRE tunnels between routers, and other novel tricks.  Reading both sides of the story was fun and educational.  I also liked Joe \\"Kingpin\\" Grand's insider theft case (ch 3), featuring Palm hacks and Blackberry sniffing.  The worm disassembly chapter by Ryan Russell and Tim Mullen is worth reading as well.<br /><br />This book is worth reading, but it's $... cover price is steep.  While the stories are fictional, much of it is probably based on the author's experiences either consulting or studying similar incidents.  This book can best be used by security professionals to test how they would have responded to the threats presented by the fictional adversaries profiled in STN.  There's plenty to be learned by reading STN, and I hope to see sequels.	2003-05-19

I bought \\"The Art of the Steal\\" (TAOTS) after being captivated by \\"Catch Me If You Can.\\"  TAOTS is an incredible book, but not because it is a masterpiece of English literature.  Rather, TAOTS is an amazing and personalized tour of a seedy underworld where ingenuity serves evil purposes.  In this dark economy, criminals prey on the ignorance, greed, or benevolence of their victims.  It's worth taking the time to read TAOTS, because it can help prevent you becoming a victim.<br />I simply couldn't imagine some of the scams Abagnale explains.  The audacity of the criminal mind cannot be underestimated.  The author's discussions of check fraud, embezzlement, and creative ways to cheat retailers astounded me.  His explanation of counterfeiting currency was especially prescient, as this week the US Treasury announced multicolor $20 bills.  I wonder if Abagnale was consulted?<br />Although I really enjoyed the book, I gave it four stars.  Abagnale should have included citations for his fraud stories.  Otherwise, how can one be sure the tales are fact and not fiction?  I would have also like a \\"lessons learned\\" or \\"best practices\\" summary at the end of each chapter.  Nevertheless, I echo Tom Hank's recommend that everyone who has money should read TAOTS.	2003-05-17

I sought a modern book that covered Windows XP and its server counterpart (where possible), and went beyond the batch files of the 1990's.  Ignoring some issues which can be addressed by an updated errata, WXPUTH will not disappoint.  It's even useful to those running Windows 2000 and NT shops.<br />Let WXPUTH be your guide to a world where graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are optional!  Author Brian Knittel introduces the reader to the full range of Windows' command-line capabilities.  Through examples, tables, explanations, and humor, WXPUTH doesn't teach everything, but instead concentrates on the most useful features of the Windows command line.<br /><br />If you've never done any scripting before, WXPUTH begins with a helpful tutorial on VBScript.  Next are discussions of object-based scripting, which allow for greater flexibility and power than simple batch files.  The Windows Script Host (WSH), Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and Active Directory Scripting Interface (ADSI) provide deeper access to core Windows functions.  WXPUTH even teaches how to create custom objects, which I found fascinating.  (This is truly getting &quot;under the hood,&quot; but in an accessible manner.)<br /><br />Where necessary, WXPUTH reveals details of Windows' innards.  Topics like X.500 and LDAP appear in ch. 8, while hidden tools like &quot;iexpress&quot; and how to start various control panel applets are discussed elsewhere.  The author isn't afraid to point out where Microsoft documentation or implementation is confusing or broken, which shows he isn't a Redmond drone.<br /><br />While the dozens of sample scripts in WXPUTH are very helpful, and offer great opportunities for customization, they sometimes seem confusing.  I think some of them need adjustment to work properly, although tinkering with scripts is a learning method.  The author also made a few questionable comments, such as not being able to use 'runas' to start &quot;Windows Explorer or any of its derivative programs&quot; (p. 560).  I am logged into Windows XP as a user right now, and have one instance of Explorer running as a user and another running as &quot;administrator,&quot; started with 'runas'.  Perhaps better technical editing might have caught similar issues?<br /><br />Regardless, WXPUTH is &quot;the&quot; book I will recommend as a resource for Windows scripting.  The first time you send an email via the command line you'll begin to appreciate the gift Brian Knittel has given the Windows admin community!le comments, such as not being able to use 'runas' to start &quot;Windows Explorer or any of its derivative programs&quot; (p. 560).

This book did not deliver, and Spafford's suggestion that those seeking \\"deeper insight\\" consult \\"IT Security\\" rings hollow.  I wondered if Spafford even read this very book when he wrote \\"all too often, management depends on the services or writings of self-professed experts whose whole experience has been in downloading and running pre-packaged penetration tools written by others.\\" (p. xiv)  The author's own words fit this mold.  Consider these quotes:<br /><br />\\"I thought these would be fun systems to break into, just because of the nature of the information stored.  My last reason [to run a penetration test] was that I had some new toys I wanted to play with.  Brad Powell, a known force in security circles for years, had just passed me some great new break-in tools.\\" (p. 74)  This sounds like the very sort of person chastised by Spafford.<br /><br />I was also appalled by the author's readiness to disparage her clients.  Consider these, from three \\"real security audits\\":<br /><br />\\"Did the company consider legal data and financial data unimportant to secure?  Or were Kenji and Dawn simply clueless?\\" (p. 75)<br />\\"In my opinion, he was a real loser.\\" (p. 61)<br />\\"Joseph clearly fit into what I call the big-L category, and that's 'L' for loser.\\" (p. 102)<br />Beyond these choice words by a consulting \\"professional,\\" the author demonstrates no concept of proper incident response procedures.  Anyone following her example will destroy evidence and corrupt investigations.  In chapter 2, she \\"helps\\" an ISP known to be suffering extensive compromise:  \\"within seconds, I had broken root and gained full control of their main sever.\\" (p. 25).  What sort of incident response expert collects evidence by breaking into a suspect system?  Similar \\"advice\\" appears in chapter 3, where \\"arguably the best security guru in the company\\" responds by \\"testing the network for security vulnerabilities\\" during the latest crisis.<br /><br />\\"IT Security\\" also shows a lack of understanding regarding IDS operations and the security \\"big picture.\\"  The author casually writes \\"Most IDS can detect the attack only if a signature exists.  Sounds silly if you think about it. . . Make sure your IDS can detect new zero-day attacks.\\" (p. 11) While this may make sense on the surface, this breezy statement has no supporting advice and is of little help.  The author then claims \\"You need to know when your company last did a security audit.  That is the only way to be sure that your systems are secure.\\"  (p. 27).  The only thing an audit reveals is the level of risk the day the audit completed.  Security is a journey, not a destination!<br /><br />I rated \\"IT Security\\" three stars because the \\"Let's Not Go There\\" sections actually contain good advice.

This is the best networking book since Scott Haugdahl's \\"Network Analysis and Troubleshooting\\" and Eric Hall's \\"Internet Core Protocols.\\"  TCN will truly test your networking knowledge; you'll quickly validate the truth and discard the fiction.<br /><br />So many books discuss networks, but somehow distort subtle points.  Authors Oppenheimer and Bardwell know their material inside-out and explain key points in clear, concise prose.  Ever hear of the \\"37% utilization rule for Ethernet?\\"  It's false.  Think that TCP sequence numbers count packets?  Wrong -- they count bytes of data.  And why are sequence numbers seemingly \\"off by one?\\"  Look at the difference between ordinal and cardinal numbers, described in ch. 9.<br /><br />TCN displays an uncanny ability to include just the information that is needed.  \\"Reversible half-ASCII,\\" which accounts for odd-looking NetBIOS traces, appears in ch. 12.  The sections on Windows networking are first-rate, with helpful comparisons of NetBIOS with IPX, TCP, and NetBEUI.  Even theoretical but damaging attack methods, like corrupting Hot Standby Router Protocol messages (ch. 8), are illuminated.<br />I have two complaints.  I would have liked more attention paid to the mechanics of analyzing traffic, including the use of taps.  Also, the Windows chapter seemed to end abruptly, just when the dynamics of Windows 2000 networking and port 445 should have appeared.<br /><br />TCN is designed to educate protocol analysts.  People with this skill set can administer LANs, analyzer network-based IDS traffic, and deploy network infrastructure.  I thank the authors for their efforts and look forward to their next endeavor.	2003-04-04

While the &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; series is more assessment- and enumeration-centric, &quot;Special Ops&quot; spends more time on proper installation and deployment of services and applications.  Most usefully, &quot;Special Ops&quot; succinctly and powerfully addresses topics neglected by other security books.<br /><br />It's difficult for security staff to keep up with the security details of new services and applications.  Admins often rely on general purpose manuals, heavy on page count but light on security specifics.  Although &quot;Special Ops&quot; weighs in at over 1000 pages, it is the first book to devote attack- and defense-driven chapters to services and applications that matter most.  Where else can one find essential, concise security advice on  Active Directory (ch. 6), Exchange and Outlook Web Access (ch. 7), Microsoft Terminal Services (ch. 9), Microsoft SQL Server (ch. 12), and Oracle (ch. 13)?  These were my favorite chapters, combining examples of attacks, defenses, and proper deployment.<br /><br />Other chapters broke new ground on old subjects.  Had admins taking ch. 10's advice on disabling WebDAV, their Web servers would not have been susceptible to the latest Microsoft IIS vulnerability.  The explanation of DNS in ch. 8 is one of the best ever written, and its installation instructions for DJBDNS are sorely welcome after the latest BIND vulnerability.  Suggestions for modifying the war dialing tool Tone Loc in ch. 2 save assessors time and effort.  Ch. 14's UNIX advice expands beyond the traditional focus on Linux to include Solaris and the BSDs, including discussions of RBAC and filesystem ACLs.  I even found something new in the wireless section (ch. 15).<br /><br />Beyond the product-specific material, &quot;Special Ops&quot; integrates several key themes.  Logging, auditing, compartmentalization, network architecture, exposure as &quot;bi-directional visibility,&quot; disabling unnecessary services -- many are applied throughout the book.<br />Because the book features contributions from nearly two dozen authors, it is sometimes internally repetitive and inconsistent.  The &quot;CAM&quot; of ch. 15 is incorrectly called &quot;computer-aided manufacturing,&quot; while ch. 16's excellent explanation of switch security correctly deciphers &quot;CAM&quot; as &quot;content addressable memory.&quot;  I would have liked reading about different ways to determine hotfix and patch levels for Windows and UNIX, or at least how existing tools make their determinations.  Advice on properly applying Windows service packs, patches, and hotfixes was missing.  Ch. 6 assumed a working knowledge of LDAP, which should have been included, at least as an appendix.  All of these can be addressed in a second edition.<br /><br />Overall, &quot;Special Ops&quot; is an incredible book.  The authors (thoughtfully identified, chapter by chapter) took the time to explain the internals of the applications they attack and defend.  Some authors -- such as the Oracle wizard -- even discovered new vulnerabilities while researching their material!  &quot;Special Ops&quot; carries a hefty page count and cover price, but you won't find another book so vital to the security of your enterprise.l Ops&quot; integrates several key themes.

I eagerly awaited the next edition of this security classic with the rest of the community.  However, like many sequels, it fails to live up to expectations.  Nine years ago the first edition was revolutionary.  In 2003, despite the addition of skilled practitioner Avi Rubin, the authors make few original contributions to the security scene.<br /><br />The book's strengths include sharing certain keen insights and summarizing key technical data.  They repeat the conclusion that frequent password changes tend to decrease security, rather than improve it.  They succinctly describe BGP and IPv6.  They accurately explain that TCP sequence numbers count bytes of data, not packets -- unlike many other authors.  Their case studies, while dating from the early 1990s, are the most enjoyable parts of FAIS:2E.  Like Avi Rubin's &quot;White Hat Security Arsenal&quot; (a better book), they cite scholarly work.  Attention is paid to the firewall software of my favorite OS, FreeBSD, in ch 11.<br /><br />On the negative side, the book is a mix of simplistic and advanced material.  In some areas the authors start with basics, while in others they use terms like &quot;black-hole&quot; (p. 249) with little regard for newbies.  The book seems disorganized; readers will find it hard to separate key points from normal text.  The &quot;forensics&quot; advice, admittedly labeled as &quot;crude&quot; in ch 17, gives incomplete recommendations which do not reflect best forensic live response practices.  (The &quot;best thing to do&quot; is &quot;run ps and netstat&quot; and then &quot;turn the computer off&quot;?)  The authors are also very negative about the Windows OS, saying on p. 255 &quot;We do not know how to secure them, or even if it is possible.&quot;  While Windows is admittedly difficult to configure and operate securely, this statement is a cop-out.  Better to direct readers to &quot;Securing Windows NT/2000 Servers for the Internet&quot; by Stefan Norberg.  Examples with IPChains in ch 11 should have been updated with IPTables, or at least IPTables should not have been dismissed as being the same except for syntax.<br />FAIS:2E does contain useful information.  I just think books like O'Reilly's &quot;Building Internet Firewalls, 2nd Edition&quot; and New Riders' &quot;Linux Firewalls, 2nd Edition&quot; are more helpful.

All offensive theory is backed up by command line examples, followed by defensive countermeasures.  Hacking Exposed: Linux, 2nd Ed (HE:L2E) follows this tradition, updating the content of the first edition and adding 200 pages of new content.  Although I reviewed the first edition in Sep 01, reading the second edition reminded me of the challenges posed by securely configuring and deploying Linux systems.<br /><br />The best way to learn while reading HE:L2E is to try the sample commands.  I also recommend visiting the links mentioned and installing many of the tools described by the authors.  I found programs like raccess, nsat (ch. 3), sslsniff (ch. 7), nstx, and httptunnel (ch. 15) particularly interesting from an attacker's point of view.  From a system administration standpoint, coverage of passlogd (ch. 2), lilo and grub (ch. 5), and X (ch. 6) were very helpful.<br />The authors share many novel ways to abuse Linux systems, but counter those exploits with little-known features or third-party tools.  I never knew I could use bash's HISTCONTROL feature to selectively remove entries from shell history files.  HE:L2E goes the extra mile to help secure your system, such as including sample C code in ch. 13 to allow one to compile TCP Wrappers support into one's own programs.  Other clear, concise defensive measures were introduced in excellent chapters on keeping the kernel and packages current (appendix B) and pro-active security measures (ch. 2).  The last appendix gives a short yet powerful description of the damage an intruder can perform, showing how he hid unauthorized programs and how those programs were discovered.<br /><br />If you use Linux, you'll find HE:L2E indispensable.  I even applied many of the tools and techniques to my FreeBSD system, showing that that good security advice can be a cross-platform endeavor.	2003-03-10

This 312 page book isn't lengthy enough to make you a Web Services security expert, but it provides a good foundation for consultants and other professionals.<br /><br />Good security books do more than teach ways to attack and defend various technologies.  They assume the reader isn't an expert in the technology or concept, and provide background prior to explaining weapons and tactics to exploit vulnerabilities.  WSS meets this challenge by educating readers on the purpose,  history, and future of Web Services.  The authors take nothing for granted, explaining why transport-level encryption via SSL is insufficient for Web Services.  WSS emphasizes key security concepts like &quot;persistence&quot; and separating policy enforcement from decision-making.  I also appreciated the authors' willingness to share key insights, like the argument that &quot;like XKMS, XACML is more about applying XML to security, rather than about applying security to XML.&quot; (p. 120).  This demonstrated knowledge of applying security to a wider range of subjects than just Web Services.<br /><br />On the down side, I found the SAML section (ch. 6) confusing.  The writing style implied another author contributed this material, and the chapter's &quot;checklist&quot; was a list of questions -- not the summaries found elsewhere.  I didn't find the legal section (ch. 14) particularly clear, either, despite the hype it received on the back cover.<br /><br />Overall, WSS is probably the best Web Services security guide currently available.  It meets the market need for an introduction to the subject, and covers material neglected elsewhere, like the Liberty Alliance Project (ch. 11).

Michael Lucas is well-known for his articles, and his knowledge and easy conversational style shine in &quot;Absolute BSD.&quot;  Of the four books I've read with &quot;FreeBSD&quot; in the title, this has been the most helpful -- but not necessarily the most comprehensive.<br /><br />The strength of &quot;Absolute BSD&quot; lies in Lucas' understanding of what matters most to system administrators.  Control of services via scripts, bandwidth throttling, firewalls, networking health monitoring, SCSI, RAID, upgrades -- these are what UNIX sys admins care about.  You'll learn the most if you follow along with Lucas' examples.  I tweaked, tuned, and typed my way through kernel builds, mergemaster, IPFilter, jails, MRTG, and other processes and tools.  Along the way I appreciated Lucas' attention to detail, like pointing out the subtleties of 'top -S', and his knowledge of obscure tools, like 'sockstat' or 'vmstat'.<br /><br />&quot;Absolute BSD&quot; does have a few flaws, and I almost gave it four stars.  I was sad to see no coverage of 'portupgrade' (though Lucas wrote about it in Nov 01) or using RSA/DSA authentication with OpenSSH.  While his instructions for Apache were sufficient to get a basic installation running, I didn't feel BIND was covered adequately.  I would trade the talk about these applications for more FreeBSD-specific material, like the excellent and unique chapters on &quot;Making Your System Useful&quot; (ch 10) and &quot;System Performance&quot; (ch 18).  Beware errors in crontab entries (pp 190-1) and probably omissions in OpenSSL (pp 313-4).  Overall, the quality of the material Lucas included in his book far outweighed my concerns.  If you know anything about FreeBSD, it's that the developers of the volunteer project are almost too busy to document their work.  Thank goodness Lucas -- a FreeBSD committer -- took the time to share what he knows!<br /><br />&quot;Absolute BSD&quot; addresses topics not found in other FreeBSD or UNIX system administration books.

Although the &quot;Windows XP&quot; title suggests a focus on desktops, WXPPS is about enterprise strategies.  It's surprising so much useful information can be packed into 400 pages.<br /><br />Good administration-oriented security books teach more than proper system configuration.  They illuminate the inner workings of the operating system and explain why certain strategies work best.  WXPPS doesn't just list OS settings; it explains what they mean and how they have consequences.  No detail is too small, such as explanations of the various registry &quot;Run&quot; keys in ch 3 or the changes to &quot;RestrictAnonymous&quot; in ch 6.<br /><br />Those who consider Windows XP to be a cosmetic upgrade to Windows 2000 will be surprised by what WXPPS offers.  The book explains several administrative and security enhancements, like Software Restriction Policies (SAFER) in ch 2 or IIS 5.1 in XP and 6.0 in Windows Server 2003 (formerly .NET Server).  Active Directory is more closely tied to security than ever before, and WXPPS explains how Windows XP Group Policy Objects can be managed within a Windows 2000 domain.  The Active Directory &quot;crash course&quot; in ch 11 does a good job bringing the reader up to speed on this crucial Windows component.<br /><br />I have few criticisms for this book.  A walk-through for configuring IPSec would have been helpful, since the Windows implementation of IPSec tunnels via &quot;wizards&quot; seems clunky.  Otherwise, I was happy with WXPPS' ability to introduce administrative or technical material as background, then proceed to explain security implications.  The wireless section (ch 9) was particularly strong in this respect.<br /><br />I've added this book to my &quot;Digital Security System Administration&quot; Listmania list, and recommend those interested read a copy.  Like Joel Scambray says about WXPPS -- &quot;Don't boot up without it!&quot;  I look forward to the Windows 2003 Server edition, should one be published.y says about WXPPS -- &quot;Don't boot up without it!&quot;  I look forward to the Windows 2003 Server edition, should one be published.	2003-01-22

Mike Schiffman and crew have recaptured the magic and published another winner: &quot;Hacker's Challenge 2&quot; (HC2).  This is the sort of book that needs to be used when interviewing new hires or promoting technical staff.  If the candidate has read the book and knows the answers to the challenges, she at least demonstrates her commitment to learning, as well as an ability to remember what she reads.  If she can solve the challenges without having read the book, she shows a higher level of skill.  If she has no clue how to respond to the challenges, you can move on to the next candidate.<br /><br />The majority of HC2 involves three subjects.  Challenges 1,3,7, and 16 revolve around wireless insecurities.  Challenges 2,5,6,15, and 17 discuss network-based attacks.  Solving the mysteries of challenges 4,11,12,14,18, and 19 require log analysis.  A few other issues are sprinkled through the text:  social engineering (ch. 8), host-based digital forensics (ch. 9), a man-in-the-middle attack against SSH (ch. 13), and a crafty buffer overflow tutorial (ch. 10).  None of the material struck me as being exceptionally original, although this accurately reflects the sorts of cases handled by most consultants!  I was impressed by the level of explanation offered by challenge 17, where vulnerabilities associated with VLAN 1 were exposed.<br /><br />HC2 has a few weaknesses.  I was sorry to see Peter Lemonjello fired in challenge 5, but he appeared to strike again in challenge 11.  Pages 126-8 featured some of the oddest techno-babble in print, offering obscure references to Rabindranath Tagore and condescending dialogue with a tech support staffer.  I've given up on seeing Mike Schiffman correctly abbreviate the Air Force Information Warfare Center as &quot;AFIWC&quot; in his biography.

Aside from revisions of &quot;Network Intrusion Detection&quot; by Northcutt and Novak, the last thought-provoking book was Paul Proctor's &quot;Practical Intrusion Detection Handbook,&quot; published in August 2000.  In 2003, IDS fans, the drought has ended.<br />&quot;Implementing Intrusion Detection Systems&quot; (IIDS) is a welcome start to a year that will see four books published with the word &quot;Snort&quot; in their titles.  IIDS pays homage to the finest detection engine in the land, but uses Snort as a sample of the capabilities an IDS has to offer -- capabilities frequently attacked in the press and by assessment-oriented companies.  Author Tim Crothers tackles the naysayers head-on in the book's second paragraph: &quot;You see media articles from well-known security writers claiming that IDS is a dead technology.  Fortunately, those writers are wrong.&quot;  Amen!<br />IIDS is clear and straightforward, with a dose of good advice and informative diagrams.  The sample IDS deployment chapter was nice to see in a published work, and the evasion section in chapter 5 was well done.  Overall Wiley did a fine job editing IIDS and the price is reasonable.<br /><br />Now for the toughest part of any review -- constructive criticism of technical details.  Crothers' discussion of &quot;passive ftp&quot; on p. 39 doesn't recognize that port 20 is only involved in &quot;active ftp&quot;.  (See pp. 456-7 of &quot;Building Internet Firewalls, 2nd Ed, for a chart to silence all debate on this topic.)  Closed tcp ports reply with RST ACKs, not the lone RSTs listed on p. 96.  The author doesn't mention that FIN scans (p. 97) are never used because the lack of a response could be easily due to firewalls dropping packets, not open ports staying quiet.<br />And, repeating the mistake seen in almost every book mentioning TCP/IP, Crothers' Appendix A claims TCPDump displays &quot;starting and ending relative sequence numbers&quot; (p. 258).  Rather, those numbers are the sequence number of the first byte of data in the segment and the sequence number of the first byte of data in the NEXT segment.  That's why a TCP segment with 432 bytes of data shows 1:433 in TCPDump -- the first byte is &quot;relative&quot; number 1, the last is relative number 432, and the NEXT is 433.<br /><br />Apart from my philosophical disagreements with the author's detection methodology and priorities, I enjoyed reading IIDS immensely.  I finished it in less than two days and highlighted many lines of text.  It will be fun to see how the other four IDS books arriving this year compare to Tim Crothers' work.ting and ending relative sequence numbers&quot; (p. 258).

I am not one of those whose network responsibilities include interdomain routing.  I bought this book to learn more about the BGP protocol and its security characteristics.  Most people fear attacks on the root name servers, as happened in October 2002.  BGP, though, could offer another disaster in waiting.  When the L0pht hacker group claimed before the Governmental Affairs Committee in May 1998 that it was possible to make the Internet \\"unusable\\" in 30 minutes, they were probably referring to resetting TCP sessions between BGP peers.  In fact, RFC 2385 was released three months later to address that very threat.<br /><br />van Beijnum's book addresses the threat and consequences of tearing down BGP sessions, and much more.  \\"BGP\\" presents an insider's look within the secret group who administer some of the most crucial aspects of Internet infrastructure.  Being an outsider, I was not able to digest everything the book offered.  I learned some memorable lingo: \\"the swamp\\" is the part of the class C address space assigned before Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) was used.  Unfortunately, \\"route flap dampening\\" was mentioned several times before being explained in chapter 10.<br /><br />I most enjoyed the chapters on security, traffic engineering, and troubleshooting.  van Beijnum presents lots of Cisco IOS configuration samples, and he clearly knows BGP.  I could have used some additional introductory sections and would have liked to see Ethereal or similar protocol analysis of BGP messages for reference.  In a world dominated by books on LANs, I like seeing books on the WAN.  Don't expect \\"BGP\\" to hold your hand, however.	2003-01-06

Smiles come from learning the personalities and quirks of the book's teenage subjects.  Winces result from the perceptions of these teenage wizards' &quot;skilz&quot; and motivations, and the author's own awkward handling of technical concepts.  THD is probably worth buying once it is republished in a cheaper paperback format, or borrowed from your local library.<br /><br />THD suffers in parts from the author's unfamiliarity with his subject material.  &quot;X Windows&quot; is not quite &quot;an emulator that offers users the familiar Windows interface&quot; (p. 11).  John Vranesevich is not &quot;thought to be one of the best hackers in the world&quot; (p. 207).  (Boy, that was funny.)  While a couple guys from the &quot;Cult of the Dead Cow&quot; were also members of &quot;L0pht,&quot; cDc did not become the @Stake company (p. 208).  The Navy &quot;SHADOW&quot; paper of 1998 mostly discovered benign network traffic, not &quot;highly coordinated scans&quot; (p. 169).  (Others fell for this explanation, though.)<br /><br />Comments about Fairbanks, Alaska's &quot;treeless tundra landscapes&quot; aside, the author clearly did a lot of research and work on this book.  He presents his teenage hacker subjects in clear and captivating prose.  He covers some of the more intriguing security events of the past few years, such as Bill Swallow's undercover work tracking the Serbian underground and revealing Mafiaboy's involvement in DDoS attacks.  Verton captured the essence of H.D. Moore with his comment that &quot;he had the unique ability to speak as quickly as his mind processed his thoughts.&quot;  Like Rick Fleming, when I last spoke with H.D. Moore in San Antonio, I also &quot;strained to listen.&quot;<br /><br />THD deserves a high three-star rating, but I couldn't rate it as highly as some of the four-star books I've read recently.  Incidentally, although the author didn't include his own web site in the book's appendices, it's worth a visit.  Maybe next time Verton will direct his considerable energy towards tackling the real sources of danger on the net: organized crime, foreign intelligence sources, and disgruntled insiders?his own web site in the book's appendices, it's worth a visit.

Frank Abagnale Jr, hero of the excellent \\"Catch Me If You Can\\" movie, wrote two books about his escapades.  Concentrate on the message, not the messenger, and you'll learn something from either Mitnick or Abagnale.<br /><br />Mitnick's message is frightening: the easiest way to get what you want may be to ASK for it.  \\"The Art of Deception\\" (TAOD) is built around dozens of realistic scenarios, showing how con men (and women) deceive victims and defeat security.  It's easy to dismiss Mitnick's insights as trite.  For example, it makes sense that \\"valuable information must be protected no matter what form it takes or where it is located.  An organization's customer list has the same value whether in hardcopy form or an electronic file.\\" (p. 227)  This \\"Mitnick Message\\" seems obvious at first glance, but how many company's act on that truism?<br /><br />\\"TAOD\\" shares technical, procedural, and psychological insights which aren't normally discussed by security personnel.  Mitnick mentions secrets of the telecom system, like reprogramming caller ID on phone switches.  He dances across company lines, shuttling information among secretaries, fax machines, voice mail, and other vulnerable parts of business life.  His understanding of human nature shows he treats his craft seriously, believing security awareness is the best defense against social engineering.  I found his \\"Security at a Glance\\" chapter indispensable, especially its 'Warning Signs of an Attack' and 'Responding to a Request for Information' sections.<br /><br />Mitnick's security policy recommendations in chapter 16 appear to be squarely based on military information handling guidelines.  I followed all of his ideas, like data classification, need to know, cover sheets, and so on, as a military intelligence officer in a top secret facility.  The corporate world, particularly the financial sector, is implementing some of these practices already.<br /><br />It's still too easy to defeat the technical defenses of many organizations.  Those who do have their networks locked down leave social engineering and insider fraud as the best ways to steal information and money.  As more organizations fall victim to \\"the art of deception,\\" they will turn to the wisdom of books by Mitnick and others.  While they won't follow Mitnick's advice to provide \\"copies of this book to all employees\\" (p. 257), they will learn how to improve their \\"human firewalls.\\".  <BR> <BR>It's still too easy to defeat the technical defenses of many organizations.

Anyone who expects to testify regarding technical issues will benefit from reading this book, although they could learn just as much by reading the &quot;Cliff Notes&quot; version.<br /><br />AGTFT shines in certain respects.  Chapter 2's excerpts from Bill Gates' testimony in Microsoft's trial, chapter 4's description of the roles of expert witnesses, and chapter 8's discussion of expert witness qualifications were excellent.  Succinct, educational guidance on producing effective visual aids appeared in chapter 10.  I also appreciated the wisdom Gene Spafford shared with readers in chapter 13.<br /><br />Elsewhere, however, I repeatedly question the dozens of pages devoted to irrelevant digressions.  Before chapter one even begins, the reader is faced by 45 pages of preface, introductions, and so on.  Once in the main text, the reader must contend with far too many lengthy excerpts from court decisions.  I'm sure the authors and editors wrestled with the problem of how much of each reference should be included.  Unfortunately, they erred on the side of too many citations.  Many are simply silly -- &quot;We sometimes don't imagine so because of the main enemy of human compassion, sloth.&quot;  Good grief.  I also didn't need to read about Viagra, cattle guards, Houdini, &quot;grinners,&quot; aikido, &quot;the unbroken circle,&quot; and other topics and metaphors intended to convey the author's intentions.<br /><br />AGTFT is a good book, but I recommend waiting for someone else to read and highlight it.  Then, piggyback on that person's work and pay attention to the main points.  Incidentally, my copy, already highlighted, stays in my library.	2002-12-14

The authors follow the methodology proven to compromise the mightiest servers.  HE:WA is practioner-focused, giving readers the opportunity to follow along as the authors dissect victim web platforms.  I highly recommend this book for its technical strengths and its ability to convey important information in an entertaining manner.<br /><br />HE:WA is particularly strong where the authors choose to explain web technologies.  Successfully compromising web platforms requires an understanding of more than Apache or IIS.  Accordingly, HE:WA gives background on SQL, web services, and web-based management.  My favorite aspect of the book is its ability to explain technical details of web-based systems with an eye towards security.  It's refreshing to be introduced to web services, for example, as well as learn how to attack and defend them -- all in a single book!<br /><br />HE:WA describes numerous vulnerabilities, chosen to demonstrate classes of attacks.  The authors provide useful methodologies for assessing web applications, each with accompanying code and text snippets.  Their explanations of cross-site scripting were exceptionally clear, thanks to this approach.<br /><br />I found HE:WA to be a fast but informative and engaging read.  The appendices, featuring &quot;best practices&quot; for securing web platforms, an assessment &quot;crib sheet&quot;, and instructions for proper deployment of URLScan, bring this excellent book to a close.  Scambray and Shema won't leave you hanging  -- they share their knowledge to help keep your systems as secure as possible.  This is the book to buy if you're responsible for web server security.	2002-11-18

In addition to explaining common methods to victimize web systems, the authors provide a basic background on web technologies.  Combined with integrated case studies, &quot;Web Hacking&quot; stands as a strong introduction to the art and science of attacking web platforms.<br /><br />&quot;Web Hacking&quot; offered several appealing aspects, and several disappointing drawbacks.  On the positive side, I found the numerous tables very helpful.  These included lists of ISAPI filters, MS SQL stored procedures, form elements, and other web technology items.  The authors also share their methodology for assessing web platforms, simulating their checklists and evaluation matrices.  The appendices were appreciated as well.<br /><br />On the negative side, &quot;Web Hacking&quot; suffers from subtle typos.  This can be beyond the authors' control, but annoying nevertheless.  For example, 0x11111111 is 255 decimal, not 256 as shown on page 371.  More troubling was the authors' repeated criticisms of network based intrusion detection systems.  While NIDS are not perfect, they do serve purposes the authors don't seem to appreciate.  Encryption may prevent NIDS from collecting the content of a session, but what if we only care to collect transactional data summarizing that session?<br /><br />Incidentally, Barnaby Jack's work on the buffer overflow section (chapter 14) was worth reading.  Overall, &quot;Web Hacking&quot; belongs on your bookshelf, although many may find &quot;Hacking Exposed: Web Applications&quot; to be more comprehensive.	2002-11-18

Now dozens appear each month, all competing for our limited time and shelf space.  Of these \\"new\\" books, hardly any offer original, innovative material.  Thankfully, Lance Spitzner's \\"Honeypots\\" breaks this trend.  His is the only book devoted to honeypot technologies, and it will both motivate and inform any reader.<br /><br />\\"Honeypots\\" is one-stop-shopping for the world of blackhat deception and observation.  Spitzner gets the reader up to speed on commercial and free honeypot technologies, then effectively argues how these tools fit within the enterprise's security infrastructure.  He concludes with explanations of how to configure, deploy, and operate a variety of honeypots.<br /><br />\\"Honeypots\\" shines with good material, like the honeypot history in chapter 3, the explanation of GenI and GenII honeynets in chapter 11, and the all-star legal discussion in chapter 15.  Spitzner also demonstrates his understanding of subtle but critical security engineering concepts, such as learning by analyzing failure (p. 8) and studying second-order effects when first-order events are tough to detect (chapter 4).<br /><br />I have two minor critiques.  First, the text could have been a bit more concise.  Second, it's best not to confuse people by calling the \\"link\\" layer by the name \\"layer 1\\" and the network layer as \\"layer 2\\" (p. 149).  Stevens and others do show the TCP/IP model as link - network - transport - application.  However, network engineers usually think of \\"layer 2\\" as the data link layer and \\"layer 3\\" as the network layer.<br /><br />I was a big fan of the HoneyNet Project's book, minus the 150 pages of IRC logs.  I think all security-minded readers will find the entire \\"Honeypots\\" book exciting.  I rarely find security books that rally me to join a cause, but Spitzner's is an exception.	2002-11-12

While important topics like communication, processes, naming, synchronization, etc. are given full chapter coverage, discussion within some chapters fall short.  For example, why introduce the concept of &quot;little&quot; and &quot;big endian&quot; on pages 74 and 75, but not adequately explain what those terms mean?<br />My favorite aspects of &quot;Distributed Systems&quot; were the chapter summaries.  I could almost have had my interests satisfied by reading these concise descriptions of key computing ideas.  If you don't need this book in the classroom, you'll probably be happy reading the summaries, too.	2002-10-22

It's advertised as a complement to Foundstone's &quot;Incident Response&quot; and &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; titles, but it contains more than enough original material to stand on its own.  Even if you've used all of the tools described in AHT, you're sure to gain insight on using many of them in unique and creative ways.<br /><br />Throughout the book, I was impressed by the authors' attention to detail.  They seem to have anticipated the sorts of questions both beginners and experts might have regarding numerous security tools.  AHT contains balanced material on both UNIX and Windows applications.  It is particularly strong with regard to integration of BSD tools.  In a world where many believe &quot;free&quot; and &quot;open source&quot; equal &quot;Linux&quot;, attention to BSD was very welcome.<br /><br />Several chapters were especially useful.  These included discussions of netcat, the X Windows System, and Windows enumeration using the PStools.  Furthermore, over two hundred pages are devoted to incident response and digital forensics.  The authors discuss how to image and investigate systems using commercial and open source solutions.  I appreciated their desire to steer clear of theory in favor of providing hands-on examples.  AHT continues the recent Osborne McGraw-Hill tradition of including numerous case studies which reinforce the proper use of tools in real-world environments.<br /><br />AHT is a must-have book for 2002.  (Note that it is NOT related in any way to the book &quot;Hackers Beware,&quot; as alluded to by a previous reviewer.)  Even if you've been using security tools for years, you're sure to find new approaches to better assess or secure your enterprise.  This book belongs next to any of Foundstone's other titles on your bookshelf.	2002-08-22

This second edition explains the trade-offs developers must make and shows readers how OS' have matured since the 1960s.  Knowledge of programming in C is helpful, especially if the reader wishes to complete the exercises following each chapter.  I gave the book five stars for its content, delivery, and humor, all of which helped me learn a difficult subject in an enjoyable manner.<br /><br />&quot;Modern Operating Systems, 2nd Ed&quot; (MOS:2E) is very well-written, which may surprise those who suffer while reading other hardcover college texts.  The book introduces problems facing developers, then helps the reader understand both simple and complex ways to address these issues.  Tanenbaum's style is lively and informative, like the cover of his books.  He appears knowledgeable and opinionated -- especially concerning problems with the Windows OS -- but he can back up his assertions.<br /><br />The best features of MOS:2E are found in chapters ten and eleven.  Here Tanenbaum illuminates UNIX and Microsoft Windows 2000, respectively, building upon the material found in the previous nine chapters.  He gives real reasons why Windows suffers security problems, such as internal complexity, code bloat, and design choices.  UNIX is also critically evaluated, but stands up better to Tanenbaum's scrutiny.<br /><br />I don't recommend computer novices read MOS:2E.  One needs a certain amount of interest and motivation to digest this material, and Tanenbaum's explanations of some concepts did not seem sufficient.  However, after having finished this 900 page tome, I feel more comfortable reading about design issues for the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD scheduler.  If you're looking to learn the how and why of operating system design and implementation, I strongly recommend MOS:2E.	2002-08-19

I wish now I'd read it a year ago!  It's rare to find a book useful to both Windows and UNIX system administrators, but rarer still to read one designed to improve one's career and attitude.<br />TPOSANA is a 'framework' book.  It teaches you how to think and leaves out the implementation details.  System administration isn't all about man pages and tech books.  The authors' principles -- simplicity, clarity, generality, automation, communication, and basics first -- will make a good sys admin great and a great sys admin extraordinary.<br />Others have outlined the TPOSANA contents, so I'll share my favorite aspects of the book.  The writing is lively and witty, with memory-jogging conclusions nicely summarizing each chapter's contents.  The text is filled with dozens of applicable and informative case studies.  Finally, the authors devote seven chapters to fundamental management and personal attitude issues, showing they know people and processes matter as much as products.<br />I highly recommend TPOSANA.  The sad irony is those most needing to read this book will push it aside, as I initally did.  Those who take the time to read it will be glad they did.  Anyone acting in a technical capacity -- sys admins, engineers, and programmers -- will find it enlightening and entertaining.	2002-07-14

In fact, it may be required reading for anyone concerned with engineering of any sort.  Ross Anderson's ability to blend technology, history, and policy makes \\"Security Engineering\\" a landmark work.<br /><br />Engineers learn more from failure than success.  \\"Security Engineering\\" brings this practice to life, investigating the design and weaknesses of ATM machines, currency printing, nuclear command and control, radar, and dozens of other topics.  Anderson's insights are accurate and helpful, partly because he's served as consultant for diverse industries.  His descriptions of criminal and intelligence agency exploitation of insecure systems are startling; fake cellular base stations, fly-by-night phone companies, TEMPEST/EMSEC viruses, freezing electronics to preserve RAM -- all are explained in layman's terms.<br /><br />The bibliography offers exceptional opportunities for further research, but the second edition needs a glossary.  I found some of the cryptography chapter too complicated for non-mathematicians.  I also believe the author was misled by whomever told him that \\"at the time of writing, the US Air Force has so far not detected an intrusion using the systems it has deployed on local networks.\\"  (p. 387) (I know from experience this is false.)  Nevertheless, these are my only criticisms for a 612 page text.<br /><br />\\"Security Engineering\\" is a book of principles, lessons, and case studies.  It offers history, tools, and standards to judge engineering endeavors.  This book actually inspired me to learn how brick-and-mortar engineers learn their trade, as their methods and failure analysis may apply to the software world.  \\"Security Engineering\\" will remain relevant for years, but I recommend you read it as soon as possible.	2002-06-27

Lt Col Rattray is uniquely qualified to write this book, serving as commander of the 23rd Information Operations Squadron in the Air Force Information Warfare Center.  While I was a captain in the Air Force Computer Emergency Response Team, he asked me if we were ready to defend against strategic information warfare attacks.  His research into this issue forms the core of his excellent book.<br /><br />SWIC is not written for technical staff.  Rattray is a fellow Air Force Academy and Harvard University graduate, and I recognize his writing style and methodology as an effort to develop analytical frameworks.  He takes an innovative approach, comparing American strategic information warfare efforts of the 1990's to development of the Army Air Corps' capability to wage strategic precision bombing.  Rattray offers four enabling conditions for successful strategic warfare and five facilitating factors for establishing organization technological capabilities.  He critiques strategic air war and strategic information war using these elements, drawing policy conclusions and making recommendations for future actions.<br /><br />SWIC is highly original, very thorough, and well-documented.  Rattray and I are both history/political science majors, so I found his discussion of Air Corps history enlightening.  Readers more interested in conclusions may be tempted to skip this material.  SWIC falls short in its descriptions of technical means to wage digital warfare.  Someone with hands-on knowledge of specific attack and defense tools and techniques should have helped Rattray refine his understanding of the technical aspects of computer security.  Nine years have passed since Farmer and Venema wrote the 'SATAN' assessment tool, yet contemporary writers still believe it exemplifies current threats.  What about Nmap, which is five years old but actively maintained and used daily?<br /><br />Overall, SWIC seems right on the money in its analysis and conclusions.  Rattray correctly identifies that American information warfare defenses are far too crime-oriented, probably due to the FBI's role.  He stresses the need to improve people and processes, not just products.  He faults the government for omitting technology vendors from the protection of critical infrastructure, and criticizes federal policy mistakes regarding encryption.

She's written a coherent, comprehensive guide to the telecommunications world.  &quot;Telecommunications Essentials&quot; doesn't omit technical details.  It frames them within a business and historical context that similar books lack.  I've read and reviewed three other recently published telecom titles, and this one is clearly the best.  Some of the details I enjoyed were descriptions of how fiber is manufactured, the number of wire pairs associated with various transmission media, and specifications for various global television standards.<br /><br />The telecom world is full of agencies, standards, and products, each referenced by a three- or four-letter acronym.  Lillian guides the reader through this technology jungle, offering clear descriptions and historical background.  She also provides a thorough glossary (87 pages) and index.  Another of the book's impressive features is its global focus, with attention given to E- and J- carrier, as well as T-carrier, systems.  Other examples include cellular telephone frequencies used worldwide.  Numerous diagrams and figures illustrate the author's main points.<br /><br />The book is not perfect enough to merit five stars.  It suffers from minor typos and at least one technical error.  Sadly, like many networking books, &quot;Telecommunications Essentials&quot; states that TCP sequence numbers count individual packets.  This is false; TCP sequence numbers count bytes of data.  Although I am not qualified to critique the accuracy of the phone-related information, I was pleased to see the remainder of the networking material was correct.<br /><br />&quot;Telecommunications Essentials&quot; is a must-buy if you want to learn about the telecom world.  Although the author devotes too many words to describing the use of technology, and future trends, overall the book is excellent.	2002-05-08
US	49796397	R2HU4RA2G85BRU	1861005156	184421539	Beginning Databases with PostgreSQL	Books	4	20	21	N	N	Ignoring typos &amp; grammar, a great introduction to PostgreSQL	I've been a PostgreSQL user for over a year, but I wanted to know more about databases in general and PostgreSQL in particular.  &quot;Beginning Databases with PostgreSQL&quot; (BDWP) answered the questions I had and introduced me to the power of this open source database.  My favorite aspect of the book was its use of &quot;Try It Out&quot; sections, where readers experiment with sample tables provided at the publisher's web site.  These hands-on exercises reinforced the lessons of the text.  I was able to install, configure, and manipulate a PostgreSQL database on FreeBSD following the authors' guidance.  Windows fans can follow the authors' instructions for running PostgreSQL on Cygwin.  Few other books give such attention to detail.<br /><br />The book's major drawback is its sloppy grammar and frequent, repeating typos.  The term 'However' appeared in many sentences for no good reason.  Commas also popped up in odd locations.  Thanks to the publisher's web site errata listing, I was able to correct most of the book's technical mistakes.  Still, these other errors were unnerving.<br /><br />Since I'm not a developer, I didn't pay much attention to chapters 13-17, where the authors describe ways to access a database using C, PHP, Perl, and Java.  I was content with the user- and administrator-based material of the first 12 chapters.  If you use a PostgreSQL database or need to create one, I recommend BDWP.  You won't gain insight into the deeper mysteries of database administration, but the hands-on lessons will provide enough tools to get you started.	2002-04-21

Annelise Anderson knows the answers, and delivers the commands and concepts the FreeBSD beginner should understand.  She offers practical guidance in a direct and simple manner.  &quot;FreeBSD, 2nd Edition&quot; could be the book that convinces members of the Linux crowd to try another operating system.<br /><br />Even though I've been administering FreeBSD servers for over a year, I still discovered many novel tips.  &quot;FreeBSD, 2nd Edition&quot; covers material neglected in other recent FreeBSD books, such as apsfilter, the printing configuration tool.  The author describes many of the small yet crucial details which make administration easier.  These helpful recommendations include enabling color directory listings, clearing print queues, accessing extra terminals during installation, printing manual pages, and searching the ports tree using 'make search name=&lt;target&gt;'.<br />Beyond minor conveniences, the author shares numerous warnings against possible technical pitfalls, like trying to use cvsup on FreeBSD 4.3 RELEASE and earlier distros.  She provides thorough documentation on many key aspects of FreeBSD administration, such as upgrades, enabling sound, and managing ports and packages.<br /><br />The book differs from most UNIX books in that it does not spend a great deal of time discussing installation and configuration of common applications, like sendmail, BIND, Apache, and so on.  While seasoned system administrators probably want more on these subjects, those new to the FreeBSD operating system need the foundation the author so skillfully builds.<br /><br />If you're new to FreeBSD, you'll love this book.  One word of caution: the binding seems weak, as mentioned in an earlier review.  I've handled my copy carefully, and it remains intact.  I hope it stays that way, since I plan to reference this book for months to come.handled my copy carefully, and it remains intact.

While the book contains good information, its internal redundancy and inclusion of security advice not specific to wireless adds unnecessary pages.  I recommend security professionals skim HPYWN for the material they need, and skip the generic network protection advice.<br /><br />Unlike the attack-minded \\"Hack Proofing Your Network, 2nd Ed\\", HPYWN is indeed a defensive-oriented book.  It offers strong overviews of widely deployed wireless technologies.  These include modern cellular networks and wireless area networks created by 802.11, Bluetooth, and HomeRF.  HPYWN offers sound advice on making the best use of available wireless defensive mechanisms, despite acknowledging that Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is \\"broken.\\"  An overview of popular wireless assessment tools like Netstumbler is helpful although not especially thorough...<br />Of the book's nine chapters, chapters 2 (A Security Primer, 50 pages) and 8 (Auditing, 43 pages) don't add anything original to the current body of published security books.  Furthermore, many wireless security topics are discussed repeatedly.  For example, I didn't need to read in chapters 1, 4, 5, and 6 that WEP's insecurities stem from weak Initialization Vectors.  Other recommendations on changing default configurations, enabling logging, and so on also appear in multiple sections.  The editor should have consolidated this information to avoid wasting the reader's time.<br /><br />Overall, Syngress should be credited for getting into the wireless game with this book.  I would have preferred to see protocol decodes, thorough documentation and usage examples for wireless assessment tools, and in-depth VPN deployment guidance.  Should the second edition of HPYWN contain this information, it will justify its current page count.	2002-04-02
US	49796397	R2TWAZFXJ36JQ6	1928994709	797120367	Hack Proofing Your Network (Second Edition)	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Original content will satisfy security professionals	It's difficult to find original material in most security books.  \\"Hack Proofing Your Network, 2nd Edition\\" (HPYN2E) breaks that trend.  Responding to feedback on the first edition, the authors have made numerous improvements in the second edition.  If you're looking for relatively novel content in a security book, read the sections of HPYN2E I discuss next.<br />HPYN2E shines in many respects.  The \\"laws of security\\" in chapter 2 are accurate and enlightening.  Chapter 4 helps teach secure programming techniques by comparing insecure and secure code snippets.  Chapter 4 also demonstrates debugging and disassembling code, usually not seen in security texts.  Chapter 8 probably contains the most advanced coverage of buffer overflows I've read in a book.  By actually showing and explaining stack traces, the authors share a level of detail sufficient to satisfy all but the most elite coders.  Chapters on \\"diffing\\" (5) and format strings (9) are robust.  Hardware hacking, thoroughly described in chapter 14, is fascinating.  The author cared enough to include numerous clear photographs of disassembled equipment, and mentioned many helpful external web references.<br /><br />While these great chapters comprise more than half of HPYN2E, the remainder is not exceptional.  I was not happy with the rambling, wordy chapters on spoofing (12) and tunneling (13).  Spare us the quotes from Dante's \\"Divine Comedy\\"!  Still, this material is easily skimmed.<br /><br />Because HPYN2E is written more from an intruder's point of view, the title doesn't seem to reflect the material.  The book isn't exactly a \\"how to hack\\" manual, but it expertly illuminates many facets of compromising information resources.	2002-03-29

It's lively, wise, practical, and thorough.  With a minor exception, BLVPN is an unqualified triumph.<br /><br />One of the book's amazing features is its willingness to not rehash &quot;common knowledge.&quot;  In other words, BLVPN assumes people who read books on Linux VPNs know something about two subjects: (1) Linux and (2) networking.  Therefore, BLVPN doesn't waste time teaching the reader how to use the command line, and it doesn't include yet another boring description of the OSI model.  Instead, BLVPN launches straight into practical, operational instructions for creating virtual private networks.  I would like to see other authors adopt this approach!<br /><br />Some of the book's key strengths include troubleshooting hints, clear diagrams, directory listings for key files, complete sample configuration scripts, and discussions of advantages and disadvantages of various VPN solutions.  Furthermore, the text is supported by a web site with copies of the scripts available for download.<br /><br />Because each chapter is a self-contained unit for each VPN technology, readers can pick a solution and begin immediate implementation.  No other VPN book delivers implementation-grade advice like this.<br /><br />My only regret was a failure to mention interoperability with BSD-based IPSec implementations.  I would have loved to see a chapter on matching FreeS/WAN for Linux with KAME/racoon for FreeBSD.  The authors should also consider describing how to configure Windows 2000/XP in IPSec tunnel mode to interoperate with IPSec on Linux and/or FreeBSD.  Additionally, I believe I found typos in the figures on pages 168-9.  I expect the book's web site errata page to publish a correction, if necessary.<br /><br />If you need to build host-host, host-network, or network-network VPNs using Linux (or really any open source platform), &quot;Building Linux VPNs&quot; is your book.  I recommend &quot;Virtual Private Networks&quot; by Yuan and Strayer as a complementary volume for those needing additional material on VPN theory and protocol encapsulation.Networks&quot; by Yuan and Strayer as a complementary volume for those needing additional material on VPN theory and protocol encapsulation.	2002-03-24

These short scenarios show how the authors employed tools and tactics to compromise client systems.  These \\"how\\" discussions nicely complement the \\"what\\" material found elsewhere in the book.  \\"Hack I.T.\\" offers clear screen shots of tools in action, supplemented by the \\"pros\\" and \\"cons\\" of each application.

First, although the covers boast a foreword by Simple Nomad, the text is missing!  Second, some of the material is internally repetitive.  The authors could have replaced redundant material with a table highlighting common features of individual tools.  Finally, as mentioned by previous reviewers, some of the material is neither unique nor especially creative.<br /><br />Despite these drawbacks, I recommend reading \\"Hack I.T.\\"  I am glad to have a published reference against which clients can measure the techniques of those performing \\"penetration tests.\\"  I can show a manager that a \\"vulnerability assessment\\" isn't simply an nmap scan, and a \\"penetration test\\" is more than running nessus...Since I provided technical editing services for \\"Hack I.T.\\", I am glad to see it serve as a practical reference for those seeking genuine assessment services.	2002-03-21

I want to encourage other authors to write FreeBSD books, since documentation helps administrators adopt unfamiliar operating systems.  Unfortunately, \\"FreeBSD Unleashed\\" suffers too many flaws to warrant more than an average to below-average rating.<br />The book suffers from three major weaknesses.  First, my 'First Printing, August 2001' edition contained typos on pages 357, 358, 363, 364, 378, 435, 730, and others.  FreeBSD newbies may not always recognize these mistakes.  Second, the book makes numerous references to scripts on an accompanying CD-ROM, but the discs sold with the volume only offer FreeBSD 4.4 RELEASE and FreeBSD 5.0 CURRENT.  I could not find the missing scripts at the publisher's web site, either.  Third, several sections refer to missing content.  For example, chapter 14 apparently should have contained guidance on automating processes using 'periodic'.  It's difficult to implement later recommendations that cite this missing documentation, such as pages 426-7.<br />Beyond these three flaws, the book does not suit its intended 'Intermediate-Advanced' audience.  The material appears to be aimed at users trying to migrate away from Windows or perhaps Linux.  'Intermediate-Advanced' users do not need lessons on fundamentals of networking like hardware and protocols.  I was also frustrated by the inclusion of a chapter on 'Perl Programming' which was too vague to be helpful.  If the authors couldn't do anything useful with the 23 pages allotted to the topic, the chapter should have been dropped.  (In contrast, I found the shell scripting chapter more practical.)<br />I really hoped to give this book a glowing review.  My company's FreeBSD servers routinely exceed 100-plus days of uptime, and I believe the OS is an incredible platform for servers.  While I found sections of \\"FreeBSD Unleashed\\" useful, they were not sufficient to make me overlook the book's weaknesses.  Strangely enough, it's probably still a good idea to buy this book if you're a FreeBSD system administrator.  It's important to collect and support documentation for this robust, powerful OS.  Unfortunately, I'm still waiting for the book that does it justice ...Strangely enough, it's probably still a good idea to buy this book if you're a FreeBSD system administrator.

I read &quot;Maximum Windows 2000 Security&quot; (MW2S) to learn more about Windows 2000 vulnerabilities.  While the philosophy espoused in MW2S is appropriate, the book fails to deliver any original content.  If you've read &quot;Windows 2000 Security Handbook&quot; by Cox/Sheldon, and &quot;Hacking Exposed: Windows 2000&quot; by Scambray/McClure, you don't need to read MW2S.<br /><br />I do not feel my time reading this book was well-spent, as I'd encountered almost every topic elsewhere.  The advice on how to exploit Windows 2000 web servers (ch. 13) was weaker than I'd expected.  The suggested tools list in ch. 3 was incredibly sparse.  I am more involved with defending Windows systems than attacking them, but I was still able to easily collect a more comprehensive Windows attack tool kit than that listed in ch. 3.<br /><br />MW2S is frequently internally redundant, with multiple chapters rehashing the same advice, most of which is already published.  The book also mentions a nonexistent CD-ROM and suggests readers to refer to the publisher's web site for certain links.  I couldn't find anything beyond the normal book catalog entry for MW2S on that web site.  I believe the book may have been rushed to publication, with loose ends left hanging.<br /><br />The original &quot;Maximum Security&quot; was interesting because it concentrated on exploiting vulnerabilities.  Five years later, its descendants are more likely to be generic security books than ground-breaking texts.  I'm hoping &quot;Maximum Network Security&quot; (due this month) breaks this trend.<br /><br />(Disclaimer:  I received a free review copy from the publisher.)	2002-02-03
US	49796397	RUGQXXJU4K4T9	0130206016	21669392	UNIX System Administration Handbook (3rd Edition)	Books	4	26	27	N	N	Pricey, but best single-source, multi-platform UNIX book	I am a senior engineer for network security operations.  I read &quot;UNIX System Administration Handbook, Third Edition&quot; (USAH:3E) to improve my knowledge of UNIX systems from a security analyst perspective.  I am not a professional system administrator and I am not qualified to refute USAH:3E's advice.  Nevertheless, because I deal with FreeBSD, Linux, and Solaris on a daily basis, I found USAH:3E to be insightful and invaluable.<br /><br />USAH:3E stands out for three reasons.  First, it covers the three most popular UNIX operating systems I know: FreeBSD, Linux, and Solaris.  (The authors also support HP-UX, but I have no direct experience with that OS.)  By comparing the features and configuration of multiple operating systems, USAH:3E is frequently far more educational than a single-OS book.  USAH:3E is the one OS book I would include in my incident response kit, along with &quot;Incident Response&quot; by Mandia/Prosise/Pepe.<br /><br />Second, USAH:3E is written to inform and entertain, and does both very well.  While most OS books are content to explain the &quot;what,&quot; and few include the &quot;how,&quot; USAH:3E also delivers the &quot;why.&quot;  USAH:3E peers deep into the workings of the OS, but keeps the discussion clear and concise.  For example, pp. 48-51  provide an excellent discussion of signals.  Table 4.1 lists 13 'UNIX signals that every administrator should know,' showing whether processes can catch or block each.  This chart and the text finally illuminated the difference between 'kill PID' and 'kill -9 PID' at the level of the OS.  Furthermore, the writing style is direct, with numerous humorous references and personal opinions.<br />The third unique aspect of USAH:3E is the author's uncanny ability to include relevant hints and trivia.  For example, as an intrusion detector, I sometimes see Windows machines appear with self-assigned 169.254.0.0/16 addresses.  I also see Windows machines attempt to dynamically &quot;update&quot; DNS entries on uncooperative BIND servers.  USAH:3E explains both events, and also how Windows 2000 increased the query load on the root name servers within a week of its release.  (Remember, this is a UNIX book!)<br /><br />As a security professional, I need to be familiar with the common systems and applications I encounter.  USAH:3E fulfilled this need admirably.  Professional system administrators may prefer to buy single-OS or single-application books.<br />(Disclaimer: I received a free copy from the publisher.)ntries on uncooperative BIND servers.

I bought &quot;Handbook of Computer Crime Investigation&quot; (HoCCI) to expand my knowledge of incident response and digital forensics.  While &quot;Incident Response&quot; by Mandia, Prosise, and Pepe remains my top pick, HoCCI contains enough original material to qualify as recommended reading.<br /><br />HoCCI is a collection of 14 distinct chapters written by 17 authors.  The book's main audience appears to be law enforcement personnel, and Academic Press markets the book as a title in its &quot;Forensic Science&quot; catalog.  The introduction states the book is written for &quot;forensic examiners&quot; who testify in court, although anyone performing digital forensics will find useful sections.<br /><br />Some of HoCCI's strengths include numerous case studies.  Ch. 2 offers examples of &quot;ineffective&quot; and &quot;effective&quot; disclosure and production of digital records in legal proceedings.  Chs. 12, 13, and 14 are dedicated to factual legal and incident response scenarios.  Reading these anecdotes, I perceived most of the 17 authors to be extremely familiar with their field.<br /><br />Beyond helpful case studies, HoCCI provides several strong technical chapters.  Bob Sheldon's Windows section (ch. 7) is excellent, and Ronald van der Knijff's embedded systems essay (ch. 11) explains the cutting edge of digital forensics.  His discussions of directly reading FLASH and EEPROM memory, and using power analysis to break passwords, are impressive.  I enjoyed Steve Romig's explanation of using Cisco NetFlow logs in ch. 4, and found the descriptions of wireless systems in ch. 10 to be useful.<br /><br />HoCCI is not without faults.  Several chapters seem like product advertisements; EnCase is the focus of ch. 3, while NFR's IDS appears in ch. 5.  The network analysis section (ch. 9) repeats the much-quoted myth that TCP sequence numbers count packets; they actually count bytes of application data.<br /><br />Overall, HoCCI is a useful supplement to Foundstone's &quot;Incident Response.&quot;  HoCCI may spend too many pages describing how to search hard drives for remnants of illicit images, illegal software, or harassing emails.  Fortunately, its technical content distinguishes it from &quot;Computer Forensics&quot; by Kruse and Heiser and &quot;Incident Response: A Strategic Guide&quot; by Schultz and Shumway.erall, HoCCI is a useful supplement to Foundstone's &quot;Incident Response.&quot;  HoCCI may spend too many pages describing how to search hard drives for remnants of illicit images, illegal software, or harassing emails.

I am not a Solaris system administrator, but I read &quot;Hack Proofing Sun Solaris 8&quot; (HPSS8) to learn more about securing Solaris systems.  HPSS8 addresses a wide variety of Solaris security issues, and is suitable for beginning and intermediate system administrators.<br /><br />HPSS8 is not a Solaris version of &quot;Hack Proofing Linux&quot; (HPL), which I reviewed in October.  While HPL seems more like a catalog of open source security tools, HPSS8 focuses on explaining the features and configuration of Solaris hosts.  The authors provide useful explanations of Trusted Solaris, with enhancements like Role Based Access Control and Mandatory Access Control.  Admins unwilling to deploy Trusted Solaris can experiment with the SunSCREEN Basic Security Module (BSM), which raises a default Solaris 8 installation to the C2 security level.  HPSS8 describes how to deploy Sun's Kerberos implementation, called Sun Enterprise Authentication Mechanism (SEAM).  The book also introduced me to Sun's implementation of file-based access control lists to protect SUID files.<br /><br />As a casual reader, not responsible for implementing these tools, I found HPSS8's coverage adequate.  I learned about enterprise-grade security features I never knew existed.  I'm not sure if admins needing in-depth explanations will find what they need in HPSS8.<br /><br />HPSS8 appears to be written by authors who know their material.  I found no errors, although I admit I am not a Solaris expert.  The network security discussions, with which I am more familiar, seemed error-free as well.  I appreciated the heavily technical buffer overflow explanation in ch. 10, and was surprised to learn in ch. 8 that Solaris by default routes packets between multiple interfaces.  The only slip in editing appeared to be unnecessary &quot;double coverage&quot; of Snort (in ch. 3 and ch. 8), probably written by different authors.<br /><br />If you're a junior Solaris admin and you need to lock down your machines, securely operate web, email, caching, routing, firewalling, and related services, HPSS8 will definitely help you.  Senior Solaris admins will probably not learn new tricks.  Security professionals who want to familiarize themselves with Solaris features will enjoy reading HPSS8, as I did.<br /><br />(Disclaimer:  I received a free review copy from the publisher.)ris admin and you need to lock down your machines, securely operate web, email, caching, routing, firewalling, and related services, HPSS8 will definitely help you.

US	49796397	R38ARPJQF6BMCY	0672321505	906872395	Voice and Data Security	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Finally a book that addresses telephone security	I am a senior engineer for network security operations.  I read &quot;Voice and Data Security&quot; (VaDS) to learn more about vulnerabilities in the voice world.  A search for &quot;voice security&quot; here yields four results, of which VaDS is the only in-print title.  Although I would have preferred VaDS to focus solely on voice security issues, I still recommend it as the only modern published reference for this critical topic.<br /><br />When reading VaDS, it's important to remember that all of the authors have some sort of relationship with San Antonio-based voice security company SecureLogix.  That's ok, as Foundstone is the powerhouse behind the successful &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; book series.  Some parts of the book read like commercials for SecureLogix products like TeleSweep and TeleWall, but the authors largely focus on non-proprietary solutions to voice security.<br /><br />VaDS is strongest when it speaks solely to voice security issues, and, to a lesser degree, network infrastructure.  I learned quite a bit about tapping phones (ch. 11), voice mail abuse (ch. 14), and voice-data convergence (ch. 5).  Chapters on broadband infrastructure and exploitation were helpful.  Even though the final chapter seemed out of place, its intriguing coverage of cyber law kept my attention.<br /><br />Less helpful were the chapters covering general security issues, such as cryptography (ch. 18), malware (ch. 19), sniffing (ch. 20), scanning (ch. 21), passwords (ch. 22), firewalls (ch. 23), IDS (ch. 24), and denial of service (ch. 26).  This material is so well-covered elsewhere that its appearance did little to help VaDS distinguish itself.  Chapter 27 was an exception, with its succinct discussions of popular Microsoft IIS web server vulnerabilities.<br /><br />Aside from including well-worn material, VaDS suffered slightly from a few technical mistakes.  Explanations of buffer overflows in chapter 4 needlessly associated them with TCP-based sessions.  UDP-based buffer overflows are exploited regularly.  The author of this chapter also seems to believe that buffer overflows are a problem because they overwrite &quot;user ID and privilege information&quot; on the stack.  That's rarely the case; subverting return pointers is the problem.  Chapters 8 and 15, describing voice protocols like H.323, were difficult to understand, and ch. 18 (p. 283) makes an unsubstantiated claim that &quot;a well-known Mid-East terrorist was discovered to be using steganography.&quot;  Typos on pp. 155-156 appeared, and port 443 was replaced by 444 on p. 69.<br /><br />Overall, VaDS marks a welcome contribution to the information security community.

I read &quot;Incident Response: A Strategic Guide&quot; (IR:ASG) by Shultz and Shumway to enhance my own understanding of ways to deal with security events.  As a &quot;strategic guide,&quot; the book will be useful to managers of incident response teams.  Nevertheless, &quot;Incident Response: Investigating Computer Crime,&quot; by Mandia, Prosise, and Pepe remains king of the hill.<br /><br />IR:ASG is well-written, and focuses attention on processes and methodology over technical implementation.  While this approach lengthens the book's shelf-life, it lessens its value to those looking for solutions to technical problems.  Still, IR:ASG offers plenty of good advice, such as guidelines for users reporting security events, tips for handling the media, and recognition of the importance of operations staff.  Chapter five provides useful recommendations for training and testing incident response personnel, and chapter ten's coverage of insider attacks is especially enlightening.<br /><br />On the negative side, incorrect material on &quot;packet sequence numbers&quot; on pages 34-5 reflects the widespread misunderstanding that TCP sequence numbers count packets.  As RFC 793 clearly states, &quot;each octet of data is assigned a sequence number;&quot; i.e., packets are NOT assigned sequence numbers; bytes of data are.  The authors do not accurately represent the 2600 DeCSS case properly on p. 148, as the issue is not copy-protection but play-prevention on non-licensed platforms.  The &quot;traps and deceptions&quot; chapter is weak compared to Lance Spitzner's truly definitive honeynet work, and in chapter thirteen the authors repeat the party line on the supposed weaknesses of intrusion detection systems.<br /><br />The best reason to buy and read IR:ASG isn't written by the lead authors.  Dr. Terry Gudaitis' chapter eleven, &quot;The Human Side of Incident Response,&quot; is refreshing and educational.  As a behavioral scientist and criminologist, she discusses &quot;cyber criminal profiling.&quot;  While the average security incident may not require application of her techniques, it's reassuring to know people with her level of skill and insight are available to add a human dimension when responding to serious incidents.<br /><br />IR:ASG reminded me of &quot;Computer Forensics&quot; by Kruse and Heiser when I read this line on p. 188 in the &quot;Forensics II&quot; chapter: &quot;The specific steps in analyzing a mission-critical system are beyond the scope of this book.&quot;  Unfortunately for both books, most readers crave details on investigating systems for signs of external compromise and exploitation.  We've heard enough about searching hard drives for remnants of illicit images, illegal software, or harassing emails.  Until another set of authors can do better, &quot;Incident Response&quot; by Mandia, Prosise, and Pepe will be the single &quot;go-to&quot; book for most incident responders.<br /><br />(Disclaimer:  I received a free review copy of this book.)scientist and criminologist, she discusses &quot;cyber criminal profiling.&quot;  While the average security incident may not require application of her techniques, it's reassuring to know people with her level of skill and insight are available to add a human dimension when responding to serious incidents. <BR> <BR>IR:ASG reminded me of &quot;Computer Forensics&quot; by Kruse and Heiser when I read this line on p. 188 in the &quot;Forensics II&quot; chapter: &quot;The specific steps in analyzing a mission-critical system are beyond the scope of this book.&quot;  Unfortunately for both books, most readers crave details on investigating systems for signs of external compromise and exploitation.

I read Scott Barman's &quot;Writing Information Security Policies&quot; (WISP) to learn more about the first element of enterprise protection.  (This refers to the planning process.  Planning is followed by protection, detection, and response.)  Although my network security monitoring duties focus on detection and assisting clients with response, security policies still play crucial roles.  Thanks to Scott's book, I now have a practical and timely reference to recommend to clients developing security policies.<br /><br />WISP may occupy only 200 pages, but its strict focus on security policy development ensures plenty of useful information in a small form factor.  The author demonstrates sound knowledge of the technical aspects of information security.  This strong foundation helps me trust his policy recommendations.<br /><br />Several concepts made a positive impression, and made me rethink my own company's security posture.  These included the idea that software licenses are an asset, subject to depreciation.  Corporate information may be assigned to owners, thereby ensuring accountability. &quot;Security communicators&quot; help bridge the chasm between users and staff.  Including security responsibilities in every employee's job description emphasizes the human element of enterprise protection.  Statements made by users in Usenet archives reflect the organization, and should be handled carefully.  A final novel topic involved &quot;duress passwords,&quot; entered by employees suffering some form of physical coercion.<br /><br />I have few negative comments for WISP.  I wish the author had included more complete sample policies in the appendices.  Perhaps he will post others to his web site?  Scott also defers certain aspects of security planning to &quot;procedures&quot; documents.  I wonder if he may have a &quot;Writing Information Security Procedures&quot; book in the works?<br /><br />I highly recommend those tasked with writing information security policies read WISP.  Thanks to its low page count and high value content, you will be glad to have it as a reference.<br /><br />(Disclaimer:  I received a review copy from the publisher.)asked with writing information security policies read WISP.

I read &quot;The CISSP Prep Guide&quot; (TCPG) as a study aid for the CISSP exam, which I completed yesterday.  CISSP candidates are not allowed to discuss the contents of the test, but I can comment on the quality of TCPG's text.  If you tear out chapter 3 (Telecommunications and Network Security), the remaining content is informative and applicable.  If you rely on chapter 3 to learn about network security, you'll be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />By performing network security monitoring, I am intimately familiar with defensive tools and tactics, and adequately informed of offensive operations.  I observe network defense and offense on a daily basis.  Unfortunately, chapter 3 of TCPG demonstrates almost no understanding of these important concepts.  The authors do not correctly explain network attacks.  (&quot;Ping of death&quot; is the most common buffer overflow?)  Their firewall deployment strategies are wrong, and their examples of &quot;protocols&quot; at each OSI layer are false.  (Since when is SQL a session layer protocol?)  The authors should have consulted someone with real knowledge of network security before publishing this poor material.<br /><br />Thankfully, beyond chapter 3, the majority of the book is helpful and reliable.  The authors cover each domain of the Common Body of Knowledge, and present information in a humorless but well-organized manner.  TCPG introduced me to management concepts I hadn't formally studied elsewhere, such as risk management, risk assessment, business continuity planning, and disaster recovery planning.  TCPG also offered helpful quizzes at the end of each chapter.  The appendices, covering the RAINBOW series, HIPPA, NSA assessments, and the Common Criteria, were also enlightening.<br /><br />Reading TCPG is not sufficient preparation for the CISSP exam.  I also read Coriolis' &quot;CISSP Exam Cram,&quot; and reviewed a CBK outline on the Internet.  Still, my experience in the field proved better preparation than these references.  Use books like TCPG to fill the gaps in your experience (probably security management), and be sure to discount material you know is incorrect.<br /><br />(Disclaimer:  I received a free review copy from the publisher.)in the field proved better preparation than these references.

I bought &quot;CISSP Exam Cram&quot; (CEC) as a study aid for the CISSP exam, which I completed yesterday.  CISSP candidates are not allowed to discuss the contents of the test, but I can comment on the quality of CEC's text.  I consider myself a tough critic, but I'm surprised that earlier reviewers treat CEC so harshly.  If you want a comprehensive treatise on all aspects of the CISSP exam, CEC will disappoint.  If you're looking for supplementary material to jog your memory before the test, CEC is more than adequate.<br /><br />Some criticize CEC because it doesn't thoroughly discuss each topic.  They may forget this is an &quot;exam cram,&quot; with only 200 pages of text for all ten domains of the Common Body of Knowledge (CBK).  You're not going to read detailed essays on the Bell-LaPadula confidentiality model or exhaustive descriptions of the Kerberos authentication process.  You will see short discussions of these topics, reminding you they may appear on the exam.  Furthermore, I found most of these explanations of higher quality than those in &quot;The CISSP Prep Guide.&quot;  Compare the coverage of SYN floods on p. 16 of CEC with p. 76 of &quot;The CISSP Prep Guide.&quot;  Here (and elsewhere), Mandy Andress knows network security, while Ronald Kurtz and Russell Vines do not.<br /><br />I concur with earlier concerns regarding URLs in the &quot;Need to Know More?&quot; sections.  SecurityFocus appears far too often, while more worthy sites are ignored.  The quizzes at the end of each chapter are far too easy, while those of &quot;The CISSP Prep Guide&quot; are more helpful.<br /><br />Reading CEC is obviously not sufficient preparation for the CISSP exam.  I also read &quot;The CISSP Prep Guide,&quot; and reviewed a CBK outline on the Internet.  My experience in the field proved better preparation than these references.

I am not a Cisco guru but I am fairly well versed in LAN technologies and protocols.  I read &quot;Cisco: A Beginner's Guide, 2nd Edition&quot; (CABG:2E) to learn about the products and services offered by the world's networking leader.  I hoped to recommend CABG:2E to my junior network security analysts.  Unfortunately, the book's error count makes it too confusing for networking novices.  Those who are experienced enough to recognize the book's problems probably don't need to read it.<br /><br />Reading a technical book is an issue of trust.  I can tolerate a few errors.  Several errors make me uneasy.  Multiple errors make me question the entire work; the authors have lost my trust.  I didn't lose complete faith in CABG:2E, but I was uneasy.  For example, p. 74 says TCP sequence numbers count packets; they actually count bytes of data.  On p. 75, the authors imply that SYN and FIN are the only TCP &quot;code bits,&quot; omitting URG, PSH, RST, and ACK.  On p. 71, SMTP is listed as a UDP protocol while SNMP is associated with TCP; they should be swapped.  P. 75 oddly states &quot;the TCP connection process is often referred to as the 'three-way handshake' because the second step involves sending the receiving station two TCP segments at once.&quot;  How about SYN - SYN/ACK - ACK as three packets, hence a three-way handshake?  The authors have a lot of trouble understanding denial of service attacks as well.  On p. 280 they equate DoS to sending &quot;infinite emails&quot; (?) and on p. 289 they invent the term &quot;FINflood&quot; to explain why Cisco CBAC tracks TCP finwait-time.  (No such &quot;FINflood&quot; attack exists.)  P. 553 mentions &quot;FINwait&quot; as another (nonexistent) DoS method.  Finally, I'll pin one early error on an editor or spell checker; p. 38's mention of &quot;du jour&quot; standards should say &quot;de jure.&quot;<br />I wouldn't be so concerned with these errors in a book for advanced users, since I imagine experienced readers would notice and discount them.  I can't expect &quot;beginners&quot; (the target audience) to recognize these mistakes.<br /><br />Overlooking the book's problems, CABG:2E includes a lot of very useful information.  I enjoyed learning about EtherChannel, VLANs, H.323, SIP, SANs, and RMON.  NAT, NAPT/PAT, routing protocols, QoS, and designing networks are all well covered.  The authors consistently define new terms as soon as they appear, and the definitions are uniformly clear.  The network blueprints in the book's center are enlightening, and the many excellent diagrams, figures, and tables greatly add to the reader's learning experience.<br /><br />Despite this book's drawbacks, I'm keeping it on my recommended reading list.  When I find a book that offers a better introduction to Cisco, I'll remove CABG:2E.  If you choose to read the book, and you're a beginner, be sure to ask a guru if you feel you've found a mistake.  Otherwise, wait to read a corrected third edition.<br />(Disclaimer:  I received a free review copy from the publisher.)nced users, since I imagine experienced readers would notice and discount them.

Prior to breaking my wrist in the spring of 2001, I studied American Kenpo with Curtis Abernathy in San Antonio, Texas.  I read and reviewed Mr. Wedlake's &quot;Kenpo Karate 101,&quot; and I'm happy to report those who liked that book will enjoy &quot;Further Insights Into Kenpo.&quot;  Although the book is mostly a compilation of previously published articles, I doubt anyone could collect them for less than this book's cover price.<br /><br />Mr. Wedlake's material comprises three major themes.  The first covers technical aspects of kenpo, such as the elbow, knee, finger, checking, and footwork.  The second discusses slightly less technical (but still relevant) material, such as tournaments, eskrima, weight training, bracing against attack, and kenpo's &quot;nine golden rules.&quot;  The third theme includes material for instructors, like judging kenpo forms, kenpo associations, overseeing sparring, arranging a seminar, and launching a Tai Chi program.  Mr. Wedlake also provides thoughts on kenpo in general, the state of kenpo 10 years after Mr. Parker's death, and counter-terrorism/bodyguard training.<br /><br />Even if you've read these articles in Black Belt or Inside Kung Fu, you will benefit from Mr. Wedlake's inserts and edits in &quot;Further Insights Into Kenpo.&quot;  Some of his comments are more interesting than the main material!  Readers may be surprised to learn that some of the words attributed to Mr. Wedlake in various published articles were the result of changes by magazine editors.  &quot;Further Insights Into Kenpo&quot; is a chance to set the record straight on several occasions.<br /><br />While I doubt readers will find every article directly useful, I predict one or two will answer some question you've carried for months or years.  I found the footwork, sparring, and &quot;golden rules&quot; articles enlightening.<br /><br />All I ask is that Mr. Wedlake continues to write these books.  While I've decided to stay in shape through cardio kick boxing, I still remain interested in kenpo.  If Mr. Wedlake keeps publishing, I'll keep buying!still remain interested in kenpo.

Unfortunately, it doesn't capture the moment very well either.  While I was surprised to see a coffee-table book like this published, I expected the photos to be a little more exciting.<br />For example, in game five against the devils, Bourque single-handedly sprawled to break up a three-on-one Devils attack.  Not a single photo appears, and the text (p. 119) says Bourque foiled a &quot;3-on-2&quot; opportunity.  Sorry Sporting News -- the goalie doesn't count, and Bourque was alone.  Bourque also possesses one of the best one-timers in the history of the game, but we don't see a single picture of Ray pulling the trigger.  We do see plenty of post-goal photos, which just about any fan not trained as a sports photographer could have taken.<br />On the positive side, the book does include a page-and-one-half spread showing Bourque saving Roy's bacon, swatting the puck aside in mid-air (pp. 46-6).  We also see a great moment on p. 79, where a helmet-less Bourque battles Keith Tkachuck in front of Roy's net.  But again -- where are the photos of Bourque skating around the Pepsi center, Cup held high?  We see a single photo on the dust jacket, and that's not enough for me.<br />True collectors will buy this book, because they're true fans.  I'm still hoping someone publishes a high-quality Bourque book and video to commemorate his incredible career.  The Avs team of 2000-2001 deserves better as well.	2001-12-01

I bought &quot;Voice and Data Communications Handbook, Fourth Edition&quot; (VADCH:4E) to gain a general understanding of communications technologies beyond the LAN.  Although the book mentions all of the systems which interested me, I was not satisfied with the manner in which they were covered.  VADCH:4E is better than Ross' &quot;Telecommunications Technologies&quot; but inferior to Green's &quot;Irwin Handbook of Telecommunications.&quot;  Nevertheless, I'm still looking for an author who delivers the goods on voice and data communications essentials.<br /><br />VADCH:4E's table of contents is sure to impress; it mentions T carriers, VPNs, X.25, Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI, SMDS, Frame Relay, ISDN, ATM, DSL, SS7, LNP, Cellular/PCS, WAP, 3G Wireless, SONET/SDH, and other key telecom systems and concepts.  Unfortunately, I rarely finished a chapter with a good grasp of the material.  I desperately searched for clues to questions I felt were key to understanding each technology.  Rather than launching into an extended discussion of each system, I would have preferred hearing exactly how each technology works, with comparison to other technologies.  More is not better if the &quot;more&quot; isn't helpful!<br /><br />VADCH:4E is advertised as being &quot;straightforward and jargon-free.&quot;  This approach supposedly appeals to management types.  In reality, the book swings wildly from mind-numbing grade-school-level analogies to material only understood with outside references.  A 1074 page book needs to pick a writing style and stay the course.  Otherwise, it alienates both nontechnical and technical readers.  (Incidentally, technical readers may wonder why the authors believe Windows screen savers contribute to LAN traffic; see page 674 to read this odd claim.)<br />On a positive note, VADCH:4E consistently offered useful information on the history and business rationale for many telecom systems.  Many of the connectivity diagrams were excellent.  (These were usually offset by cheesy &quot;clip-art&quot; type graphics elsewhere, unfortunately.)  VADCH:4E also includes descriptions of the framing formats for most telecom transmission systems.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend reading a book this large if it doesn't answer the key questions I expect readers to ask.  While I'm more familiar with telecom basics after reading VADCH:4E, I still hope another book makes more sense of the telecommunications environment.nectivity diagrams were excellent.

I am a senior engineer for network security operations.  I've read and reviewed every edition of the &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; series since the 1999 original.  &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; is a winner; the authors' powerful example-driven style teaches the tools and tactics of vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.  Nevertheless, I've compared this third edition to its &quot;Hacking Linux&quot; and &quot;Hacking Windows 2000&quot; cousins, and I believe the authors should rethink their goals for the &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; series.<br /><br />&quot;Hacking Exposed, Third Edition&quot; (HE:3E) describes techniques to attack and defend a wide variety of network assets: Microsoft products (9x, ME, NT, 2000, XP), UNIX variants, Novell's NOS, routers, PBXs, firewalls, and so on.  Weaknesses in individual applications are explained, with attention given to remote control tools (VNC, Windows Terminal Server, PCAnywhere), Web technologies (IIS, ColdFusion, ActiveX, Java), and file sharing/chat systems (Napster, IRC).  Readers are unlikely to find so many topics given fairly thorough coverage in a single volume.<br /><br />Unfortunately, at 727 pages, HE:3E has gained too much weight.  The 1999 first edition offered 484 pages, and the 2001 (yes, 2001) second edition gave 703 pages.  While the authors should be credited for not simply copying and pasting material from their 2001 edition of &quot;Hacking Exposed: Windows 2000,&quot; many of the same topics appear in both books.  Furthermore, some subjects are redundantly described within HE:3E.  For example, why rehash port redirection and rootkits in chapter 14 when they were adequately covered in earlier sections?<br /><br />I strongly recommend the authors remove the UNIX- and Windows-specific material from a future fourth edition of &quot;Hacking Exposed,&quot; directing readers to &quot;Hacking Linux&quot; and &quot;Hacking Windows&quot; when necessary.  The authors should briefly describe general UNIX and Windows vulnerabilities in &quot;HE:4E,&quot; and devote most of the book to their methodology and systems not covered in other books.  This overhaul will give the authors a chance to remove some dated material from &quot;Hacking Exposed,&quot; like a reference to ISS RealSecure v3.0 (6.0 is now in use).<br /><br />I recommend readers who have not read previous &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; titles buy this book.

I read &quot;Hacker's Challenge&quot; because one of my work duties involves training tier one and tier two security analysts.  (Tier one analysts can recognize insecure digital assets; tier two analysts  understand the threats to insecure digital assets; tier three analysts can manipulate most aspects of digital assets to mitigate insecurity.)  I hoped &quot;Hacker's Challenge&quot; would educate my tier one and possibly tier two students.  I now realize the book offers something for security professionals at all levels of expertise.<br /><br />&quot;Hacker's Challenge&quot; is a collection of twenty &quot;case studies.&quot;  By dropping the reader into an incident response scenario, the book challenges security professionals to answer tough questions: How did the intruder gain access?  What tools were used after the compromise occurred?  How do you mitigate that threat in the future?  This approach breathes new life into the world of security reading.  Students will learn a lot by taking the time to answer these questions before consulting the well-written &quot;solutions&quot; section.<br /><br />I noticed several technical themes repeated throughout &quot;Hacker's Challenge.&quot;  They included wireless vulnerabilities, Unicode and directory traversal attacks against Microsoft IIS, and older Solaris exploits.  I particularly enjoyed the SQL server attack (challenge 7), and the thorough description of the sadmind worm (challenge 8).  I liked the Macintosh case (challenge 15), but wished for coverage of OS X.  Finally, the need for network security monitoring via intrusion detection system was wisely emphasized in many &quot;solutions.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hacker's Challenge&quot; isn't perfect, however.  HK.exe, mentioned in challenge 10, exploits the &quot;spoofed LPC port request&quot; vulnerability of MS00-003, and doesn't involve directory traversal or Unicode.  While an old Checkpoint ACK flood vulnerability was well explained (challenge 17), one of the references pointed to an unrelated IP fragmentation vulnerability.  Also, the lead author should change his reference to the Air Force Information Warfare Center from &quot;AFWIC&quot; to AFIWC.  He might also re-evaluate his interest in the TAB soft drink.  (Read challenge 20!)<br /><br />I plan to incorporate &quot;Hacker's Challenge&quot; into my analyst development program.  I believe challenges 1,4,5,8,12,13, and 16 are suitable for tier one personnel.  Challenges 2,3,6,10,11,14,15,17 and 18 are suitable for tier two staff.

Start here to learn digital security.	I am a senior engineer for network security operations, who has taught SANS, InfraGard, and FIRST audiences.  Since late 1998 I've been looking for the one book I could recommend to newcomers to the digital security realm.  Ed Skoudis' &quot;Counter Hack&quot; is that book.  My previous reviews show I don't shelter weaker books, and I reserve praise for truly deserving titles.  &quot;Counter Hack&quot; is a solid, accessible, practical title that merits my highest recommendation.<br /><br />&quot;Counter Hack&quot; contains all I could ask for in an introductory book.  Chapters three (30 pages) and four (40 pages) provide the basics of UNIX and Windows (respectively).  For each operating system, one reads about file architecture, accountability, privileges, trust, and services.  Armed with this background, &quot;Counter Hack&quot; then explains reconnaissance, scanning, application/OS-based attacks, network-based attacks, denial of service, maintaining access, and covering tracks.  Each chapter is thorough and very well written.  Chapter twelve's three attack scenarios are a fitting conclusion, showing how the earlier tactics are utilized in realistic network intrusions.<br /><br />Veterans will find &quot;Counter Hack&quot; useful too.  Some of the topics receiving exceptionally good coverage are Route's &quot;Firewalk&quot; tool, IDS evasion techniques, the Achilles web proxy/attack tool, netcat relays, Reverse WWW Shell, and Covert_TCP.  &quot;Counter Hack&quot; includes the single clearest, most concise explanation of stack-based buffer overflows I've read.  It offers novel material, like a comparison of netcat's superiority to telnet, and implementing source routing attacks.  Most of these discussions include excellent diagrams and well-documented command line instructions.<br /><br />&quot;Counter Hack&quot; is not perfect.  I think the mentions of sequence numbers could be more accurate (ACK with ISN B+1 rather than simply ISN B, for example).  Also, early in the book MAC addresses are shown with four bytes, when they are actually six bytes.  These minor errors were the only ones I found, however.<br /><br />If you are a new player in the security arena, I highly recommend reading &quot;Counter Hack.&quot;  I plan to buy several copies for my office.  It's the single most useful volume published for entry level security personnel, and it also contains material which veterans will appreciate.<br /><br />(Disclaimer:  I received a free review copy from the publisher.)MAC addresses are shown with four bytes, when they are actually six bytes.

I am not a Linux expert, nor do I have experience using all of the tools included in &quot;Hack Proofing Linux&quot; (HPL).  Unfortunately, I don't believe HPL was written by experts either; few have knowledge spanning the entire open source security arena.  By venturing beyond the authors' core expertise, HPL offers some incorrect information.  If you accept these limitations, HPL still introduces an impressive array of Linux security applications.<br /><br />The deployment of Linux antivirus solutions is HPL's first example of questionable material.  The authors seem to think products like AntiVir exist to protect Linux hosts.  Actually, Linux-hosted anti-virus solutions primarily screen email traffic for Windows-based malicious logic.  Finding a &quot;VBS.FreeLink&quot; virus on a Microsoft-based CD-ROM, mounted on a Linux system, doesn't qualify as protecting the Linux operating system.  (See p. 123 for this example.)<br /><br />The second sample of questionable material involves discussions of the nmap port scanner.  Chapter 3 doesn't provide accurate information on the tool's options.  On p. 136, &quot;-s&quot; doesn't mean &quot;stealth&quot; in all cases.  P. 137 provides this puzzle: &quot;-sS uses the SYN feature of TCP... even if the remote computer doesn't want to communicate with your host, NMAP is still able to gather sufficient information from this scan to learn the open ports.&quot;  On p. 140, we should hear that specifying &quot;ME&quot; in a decoy scan indicates where to place your true source IP; it doesn't &quot;increase the likelihood that your system will be hidden from IDS logs.&quot;  P. 142 incorrectly says -sS &quot;helps the scan get past firewalls, which often filter out initial SYN packets.&quot;  Material like this seems like speculation or misinterpretation, not sound advice.<br /><br />Beyond technical inaccuracies, I believe HPL is more about installation of tools and less about operational use.  Knowing how to install Snort with database support is significant.  Having the ability to configure the ruleset, interpret the alerts, and operationalize the system is far more important.  That level of detail deserves a separate book, not several pages in a single chapter.<br /><br />Still, I haven't seen another book which covers so many open source security tools.  You'll find instructions for installing GPG, nmap, Nessus, Tripwire, TCPDump, Ethereal, EtherApe, OpenSSH, Squid -- the list goes on.  Beyond verifying the material I believed was inaccurate, I skimmed much of these installation and basic usage instructions.  Should someone need help deploying one of these tools, HPL will probably be useful.  Just be sure to verify the material against the documentation provided by the application's authors.<br /><br />(Disclaimer:  I received a free review copy from the publisher.)ational use.

US	49796397	RRE1QPFB2MS2X	1928994318	912744393	Hack Proofing Your Web Applications	Books	4	4	10	N	N	Another surprisingly good security book from Syngress	I am a senior engineer for network security operations. Since I am not a developer, I was initially reluctant to read and review a book seemingly targeted towards programmers. From a non-developer, security professional standpoint, I believe \\"Hack Proofing Your Web Applications\\" (HPYWA) is an excellent book. Because HPYWA provides sufficient background, administrators will find it enlightening. Programmers should find it practical as well.<br /><br />HPYWA is unique. One sees dozens of general networking and security texts, but few on securing applications. Since attackers are gravitating towards exploiting subtle application flaws, HPYWA's advice is timely and sorely needed. Talented authors (who should be credited chapter-by-chapter) explain security strategies for Visual Basic for Applications, CGI, Java, XML, ActiveX, and Cold Fusion. They tell how to avoid becoming a \\"code grinder\\" (\\"a developer who lacks creativity... bound by rules and primitive techniques\\"). They also discuss general exploit techniques, but not to the depth of a \\"Hacking Exposed\\" volume.<br /><br />Crucially, throughout the book, the authors do not assume the reader is an expert in all technologies. They instead begin with solid introductions to languages and tools. These help non-programmers understand the issues, and give developers common foundations for code improvement.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed by chapter 6, which explained how to conduct code audits and reverse engineering. Even without a great deal of programming background, I understood the author's explanations of format string vulnerabilities, cross-site scripting, and related problems. Chapter 7 was also excellent, as it showed how to disassemble Java byte code and alter it with a hex editor.<br /><br />HPYWA is not perfect, however. Despite offering very strong coding advice, discussions of network-based security issues contained flaws. For example, the descriptions of denial of service on pages 13-14 and 285-286 are confused. On page 171, \\"SMTP\\" is not \\"Sendmail Transfer Protocol.\\" Since I didn't read HPYWA to learn network security techniques, I didn't weigh these errors too heavily.<br /><br />Developers will probably view HPYWA as a useful reminder of sound programming practices. They will also find the specific recommendations (avoid certain system calls, watch out for these formatting errors, etc.) practical and immediately applicable to their work. System administrators and security professionals will gain an understanding of the underlying weaknesses in the technologies they deploy and maintain. In short, HPYWA has a place on the bookshelves of both communities.[....].

I read this book to improve my knowledge of Solaris.  Previous reviewers express widely differing opinions of &quot;Solaris Administration: A Beginner's Guide&quot; (SA:ABG).  These reactions seem to be based on their expectations of the book.  If you need an in-depth Solaris reference, buy &quot;Solaris 8: The Complete Reference.&quot;  If you want an introductory text with more content than &quot;Solaris for Managers and Administrators,&quot; try SA:ABG.<br /><br />Solaris users have traditionally suffered a lack of good third-party administration books.  While not as useful as the excellent &quot;Linux Administration: A Beginner's Guide,&quot; SA:ABG gives the reader enough information to start administering Solaris machines.  This is a practical book, showing how to install the OS, use the shell, and add/remove/create packages.  As a Solaris advocacy book, SA:ABG also shows Windows and Linux admins how their favorite GUI or command-line features have Solaris counterparts.<br /><br />Certain aspects of SA:ABG pleasantly surprised me.  For example, chapter 8 shows how to use 'truss' to trace system calls, and gives brief descriptions of /proc tools like pflags, pcred, pmap, and so on.  Chapter 19 explained why NIS and NIS+ are still useful on a DNS-enabled network, and made comparisons to the Windows 2000 Active Directory.  I also appreciated learning how to use Samba tools like nmblookup, smbclient, and smbstatus to interface with Windows or Samba servers.<br /><br />On the negative side, SA:ABG's security chapter explained how to disable services started by inetd, but didn't fully describe how to disable non-inetd services using /etc/init.d/ scripts.  This sort of advice is critical for newbie Solaris admins.  Solaris offers a slew of network services by default; disabling the majority of them is a priority.  I also believe the sample bash scripts on pages 113-117 could have used clearer syntax, using brackets where needed.<br /><br />I have yet to read &quot;THE&quot; Solaris administration book, suitable for beginners and wizards alike.  If you're new to Solaris, SA:ABG is a good place to start.  If you need advanced instruction, keep looking!<br />(Disclaimer:  A received a free review copy from the publisher.)ere needed.<BR> <BR>I have yet to read &quot;THE&quot; Solaris administration book, suitable for beginners and wizards alike.

I read &quot;Hacking Exposed Windows 2000&quot; (&quot;HEW2K&quot;) to learn how adversaries compromise Windows hosts.  Like the original &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; (now in a third edition) and the newer &quot;Hacking Linux Exposed,&quot; HEW2K delivers no-nonsense, high-impact security information.  I give all three books my highest recommendation.<br /><br />Having read the original &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; in Oct 99, I knew the authors possessed strong Windows security and administration skills.  HEW2K gives the Foundstone crew a way to share their knowledge with the world.  Thankfully, HEW2K doesn't repeat information found in the general-purpose &quot;Hacking Exposed.&quot;  For example, HEW2K covers Windows-specific denial of service issues, but directs readers to &quot;Hacking Exposed, Third Edition&quot; for a broader description of DoS.  The same approach is taken with social engineering and dial-up security.<br /><br />The &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; series differ from the &quot;Maximum Security&quot; and &quot;Hack Proofing&quot; titles.  While the latter are predominantly defensive-minded, HEW2K and its cousins are more offensive in nature.  Vulnerability assessors and penetration testers will appreciate this focus.  I was able to immediately apply tools and techniques in HEW2K to discover at-risk hosts on client networks.<br /><br />HEW2K continues to offer the best combination of command-line examples, screen shots, and sample output of any security books I've read.  I could literally read, type commands, and check results against the material in HEW2K.  Furthermore, HEW2K covers topics given little attention elsewhere; these include attacking and defending SQL Server, Terminal Services, and client applications.  HEW2K also gives enough background on each topic, like ISAPI filters or ASP, to give unfamiliar readers enough context to understand security implications of these technologies.<br /><br />HEW2K is another must-buy from Osborne McGraw-Hill.  As Foundstone principles, the authors ride the cutting edge of security developments.  They recognize and communicate that application security (IIS, SQL Server, etc.) is the target of choice as administrators lock down layer 4 and below.  With its clear methodology, expert explanations, and inside tips, HEW2K easily differentiates itself from the pack.  We readers benefit, and hopefully our adversaries will not.<br /><br />(Disclaimer:  I received a free review copy from the publisher.)is another must-buy from Osborne McGraw-Hill.

I read &quot;Computer Forensics: Incident Response Essentials&quot; (CFIRE) because I am responsible for performing intrusion detection and incident response on a daily basis.  Those with similar skills will probably consider CFIRE too basic.  Those working outside the information technology world may find CFIRE enlightening.<br /><br />I'm a graduate of the SANS System Forensics, Investigation, and Response course and have read &quot;Incident Response: Investigating Computer Crime&quot; (IRICC) by Mandia, Prosise, and Pepe.  In my opinion, CFIRE does not offer any new or truly significant material.  For example, chapter 2 (&quot;Tracking an Offender&quot;) offers several pages on how to find the headers in Outlook messages.  Elsewhere, one discovers very elementary information on UNIX commands, searching Windows hard drives, and understanding UNIX file systems.  All of this appears in other books or is common knowledge for IT staff.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the impressive reviewer list did not detect several errors.  As a fairly young network engineer, I still recognized this mistake on page 32: &quot;When you dial to an ISP with a modem, you might use a layer 3 protocol called Point to Point Protocol (PPP).  Referring back to Figure 2-1, layer 3 is the network layer, and in the case of a dial-up connection, PPP replaces IP.&quot;  Untrue -- PPP is actually a layer 2 protocol; IP is used above PPP.  Furthermore, figure 2-1 on page 24 presents numerous problems: NetBEUI spans layers 3 to 5 (not 3 to 4), web browsers and email clients do not belong at layer 7 (they are applications which call layer 7 protocols), and so on.  Also, page 121 claims &quot;you cannot delete an alternate stream from the command line.&quot;  However, page 193 of &quot;Hacking Exposed: Windows 2000&quot; demonstrates how to remove streams.<br /><br />On the positive side, CFIRE will probably not scare non-IT staff.  They will probably find the numerous tables, screen shots, and references useful.  This book could be viewed as a gentle introduction to the incident response and forensics field, especially for the Microsoft Windows crowd.<br /><br />Two types of staff wear &quot;computer forensics&quot; hats.  The first type investigate misuse of computers, typically by authorized personnel.  This group is happy to know how to image a drive and search the copy for signs of illicit images or software.  The second type investigates compromises, where unknown (usually remote) parties have penetrated a network and used machines for their own purposes.  This group will be unsatisfied when CFIRE states on page 132 &quot;we don't anticipate that most readers of this book will become this specialized.&quot;  If you need that deep level of knowledge, read &quot;Incident Response: Investigating Computer Crime.&quot;<br /><br />(Disclaimer: The publisher provided a free review copy.)find the numerous tables, screen shots, and references useful.

I was hesitant to read &quot;CyberRegs,&quot; given its &quot;Business Guide&quot; subtitle.  Noticing the book mentioned controversial topics like the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA), Napster, and the DeCSS case, I decided I'd give &quot;CyberRegs&quot; a try.  That proved to be a wise decision, and I strongly recommend this book to anyone worried about the future of the Internet.<br /><br />The book is exceptionally well-written, with a clear style and a welcome lack of typos (gasp).  In a former life I read plenty of boring, repetitive policy books, but I had no trouble digesting &quot;CyberRegs.&quot;<br /><br />The book is arranged around the themes of copyright, patents, electronic signatures, and privacy.  &quot;CyberRegs&quot; gives both sides of each argument, but wisely includes the authors own helpful opinion.  (I was pleased to see the author share many of the security community's views on the DMCA, Napster, and so on.)  Because Zoellick presents balanced arguments, readers will understand the opposition's complaints and can more effectively counter them.<br /><br />&quot;CyberRegs&quot; was written to help business people engage in the debates and legislation shaping the Internet.  Along the way the reader gains a solid historical understanding of how we arrived at the current state of affairs.  Would you believe that software or business methods weren't patentable until recently?  Would you believe the United States was the world's most egregious intellectual property pirate until 1891?  Given this background, readers gain a sense of why policies developed, and how one can help influence the present and future of the Internet.<br /><br />I found no major weaknesses in this book or its arguments, but I have two technical/security comments.  First, &quot;Web bugs&quot; can be used to transfer more information than an IP address; some use &quot;Web bugs&quot; to validate email addresses.  Second, giving customers access to data collected by businesses opens bigger doors for malicious hackers to manipulate that data.  Readers may share these concerns, which the author doesn't address.<br /><br />&quot;CyberRegs&quot; seems marketed as a &quot;business guide,&quot; and speaks in part to &quot;business people.&quot;  As a technical person, I gained the knowledge needed to better defend my opinions on copyright, patents, electronic signatures, and privacy.

I have attended Eric Cole's excellent SANS classes and consider him a professional acquaintance. &quot;Hackers Beware&quot; is a welcome contribution to the security community. Although some of the material is redundant, you're bound to gain new insights on network intrusions by reading this book.<br />The message of &quot;Hackers Beware&quot; is clear: prevention is preferred, but detection is mandatory. To discover intrusions, one must understand the tools and tactics of the adversary. To this end, &quot;Hackers Beware&quot; devotes chapters to information gathering, spoofing, session hijacking, denial of service, buffer overflows, password security, access preservation, and log cleaning. Some of the material in these chapters is based on the &quot;practicum&quot; required of SANS students.<br />My favorite section, without doubt, was chapter 17: &quot;Other Types of Attacks.&quot; It features many valuable essays by SANS students on BIND NXT exploitation, cookie-based overflows, SNMP enumeration, and other topics.<br />Publishing student material has its drawbacks, however. &quot;Hackers Beware&quot; is repetitive, a sin given the book's page count (778). Why include yet another explanation of buffer overflows in chapter 14, for example, when a whole chapter (7) already discusses them? (Actually, Brent Hughes' work in chapter 14 is more enlightening!) Furthermore, the &quot;fundamentals&quot; of UNIX and NT chapters are much less informative compared to Ed Skoudis' chapters in &quot;Counter Hack.&quot;<br />I also recommend New Riders help the author overcome his addiction to &quot;three phrase sentences,&quot; such as &quot;Now the Internet is very popular, and everyone is using Linux because it is powerful and inexpensive, so the number of people beating on the system is very high.&quot; (p. 480.)<br />Future editions should reduce the number of vulnerabilities described in favor of more thorough explanations of sample exploits. For example, a virtual reprint of cDc's advisory on a NetMeeting weakness teaches me very little; providing background on the coding, system calls, and principles of this exploit is more useful. I would also pare the student-based material down to the essential core, removing generic material discussed elsewhere.<br />I'd almost buy &quot;Hackers Beware&quot; for chapter 17 alone, so I'm sure security professionals will find many reasons to enjoy this book.<br />(Disclaimer: I received a free review copy from the publisher.)ons of sample exploits.

I reviewed and provided feedback on a draft of &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; (KYE) and I am credited on page xiii.  This book by the Honeynet Project breaks new ground in the security and publishing communities.  It is the first substantial &quot;intelligence report&quot; on those who use the Internet for destructive means, and will enlighten readers of all skill and experience levels.<br /><br />As a former Air Force intelligence officer, I share the Honeynet Project's desire to gain insight into the tools, tactics, and intentions of the enemy.  After explaining the technical details of configuring the honeynet, the authors discuss the attacks launched against their monitored network.  The book's level of detail is excellent, as it includes network traces, log entries, and even keystroke captures.  This multi-dimensional analysis is exactly the sort of information needed by intrusion detectors and other security personnel.<br /><br />Beyond the descriptions of various incidents, the authors reveal several key insights.  First, the security community must look beyond the tools used by the adversary, and understand tactics and intentions.  Second, data collection is critical; alerts mean little without supporting evidence.  Third, defense in depth applies to intrusion detection, as it is best to use logs from routers, firewalls, IDS, and hosts together when analyzing events.<br /><br />The main reason I gave the book four stars was the inclusion of 100 pages of IRC logs in chapter 11.  This did not add much to the 328 page book.  The analysis of the chat sessions near the end of the chapter was more helpful.  That section could have paraphrased the chatting or made reference to transcripts on a CD-ROM.  I also hope future Honeynet Project books address Windows NT/2000 compromises, and ways to perform digital forensics on those systems.<br /><br />Overall, I found &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; to be highly motivational.  I was glad to finally see proof that the &quot;good guys&quot; share information!  (I think we give the &quot;bad guys&quot; a little too much credit in that respect.)

US	49796397	R364DYHJKP9QC7	0072127732	808510638	Linux (Hacking Exposed)	Books	5	58	59	N	N	Excellence through examples	I am a senior engineer for network security operations. I read &quot;Hacking Linux Exposed&quot; (HLE) to learn how adversaries compromise Linux hosts. HLE impressed me at every level. I highly recommend system administrators and security personnel read and heed this book's recommendations.<br />The &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; series is known for its unique example-driven style. Rather than telling the reader about a technique or problem, the authors demonstrate the issue using command-line examples. I find myself reading with book and laptop at hand, ready to duplicate the authors' sample commands. This process reinforces the authors' message, while the reader learns if a specific problem applies to his situation. Furthermore, by showing exactly how to execute certain commands, the authors impart bits of wisdom and trickery not found elsewhere.<br />For example, chapter 11 describes attacks and defenses for FTP servers. To explain active and passive FTP sessions, the authors demonstrate running an FTP client with the -d switch to illustrate raw instructions sent by the client over the FTP command channel. I had never seen this switch in use, but as an intrusion detector I constantly see raw FTP instructions like those revealed by the -d switch. These and other tidbits, like using the chattr -i command or setting the &quot;sticky bit&quot;, make HLE exceptional.<br />Beyond these benefits, readers will enjoy clear, thorough explanations of Linux security issues. HLE gives first-rate descriptions of ssh and web man-in-the-middle attacks, race conditions, and FTP data hijacking. HLE also provides great illustrated examples of FTP bounce attacks, giving intrusion detectors the minutiae we need to recognize these techniques. I had heard of most of the compromise methods offered by HLE, but never seen them discussed in such practical detail.<br />If the material in chapters 1-13 of HLE don't prompt you to verify your Linux host's integrity, then the case studies in appendix D will. The security community needs more of these narratives. These stories, based on true events, show the lengths to which some attacks will go to penetrate target machines.<br />&quot;Hacking Linux Exposed&quot; is another strong addition to the &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; series, and the security community will benefit as a result.<br />(Disclaimer: I received a free review copy from the publisher.)dix D will.

I read &quot;Virtual Private Networks: Technologies and Solutions&quot; (VPN:TS) to gain a better understanding of this key component of modern networking.  While VPN:TS is not the VPN equivalent of Rich Stevens' &quot;TCP/IP Illustrated,&quot; it's the best general-purpose VPN book I've read.<br /><br />Thanks to the book's logical arrangement, precise wording, and short length (281 pages of text), VPN:TS is a fast read.  (I finished it in a little more than one day.)  It offers clear diagrams of various architectures and protocol headers.  VPN:TS is technology neutral, preferring to describe principles and protocols instead of products.  Consequently, those looking for a how-to manual for configuring Cisco router or Checkpoint Firewall-based VPNs should look elsewhere.  I welcomed this approach, since I have no need for information on popular VPN implementations!<br /><br />VPN:TS struck me as more than a book about virtual private networks.  Because little time was spent elaborating product configurations, the authors discussed related networking topics.  These included chapters on cryptography, authentication, PKI, access control, and network management.  VPN:TS also describes the relationship between  Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Quality of Service (QoS).  Readers familiar with all of these topics might not appreciate this material, but I enjoyed it.<br /><br />I was disappointed that VPN:TS did not offer any traces to demonstrate various protocols in action.  I believe the authors should have demonstrated building a sample VPN solution, complete with example configuration files and installation steps.  An open source project like Linux FreeS/WAN or BSD KAME would have been ideal.  This demonstration would have allowed discussions of troubleshooting common client/server obstacles.<br /><br />VPN:TS is not the sort of reference book to place next to your router, firewall, or laptop.  It's best suited to learning general VPN design and deployment.  Those seeking technical implementation details will have to look elsewhere.  Those who want to learn the role of VPNs in the wider networking realm will appreciate VPN:TS.<br /><br />(Disclaimer:  I received a free review copy from the publisher.).

I read &quot;Maximum Linux Security&quot; (MLS) to learn more about defending Linux hosts in hostile environments (i.e., the Internet).  Compared to recent editions of &quot;Maximum Security,&quot; MLS is more useful and accessible.  I recommend this book as a supplement to &quot;Hacking Linux Exposed&quot; and &quot;Real World Linux Security.&quot;<br /><br />MLS is less list-oriented than the typical &quot;Maximum Security&quot; book.  Useful advice on practical security measures takes the place of exploit listings.  While you'll find discussions of older vulnerabilities, the most ancient are isolated in appendix B.  The appendix also offers lengthy, detailed command listings and glossaries, unlike any I've recently seen.<br /><br />The friendly tone of the book reminded me of a mentor speaking to a novice.  Furthermore, the authors clearly know their material.  For example, Linux frequently demands compiling tools from source code.  Sometimes this process requires tweaking the code before running 'make'.  The authors regularly give specific advice on the changes needed to get the code working properly.  This attention to detail impressed me, and helped me run some of the example applications as I read the text.  The authors also gave great clues on applying patches, a task required of every system administrator.<br /><br />Beyond its specific use as a Linux security text, MLS also lets readers learn of other resources useful to security practioners.  I was pleased to check out the Linux Cross Reference project, where I can browse and link to several incarnations of the Linux kernel.<br /><br />On the negative side, the back cover advertises MLS as an &quot;intermediate-advanced&quot; text.  While I thought the diagrams and explanations of the introductory chapters were well-done, they clearly depicted basic material.  I also felt the discussion of intrusion detection failed to reflect front line experience with that technology and process.<br /><br />If you're looking for a more defensive-minded Linux security book, give MLS a try.  Those with an offensive mindset (like penetration testers) should stick with the Hacking Exposed series.  Readers looking for the high end of Linux security theory will like Bob Toxen's &quot;Real World Linux Security.&quot;<br /><br />(Disclaimer:  I received a free review copy from the publisher.)technology and process.<BR> <BR>If you're looking for a more defensive-minded Linux security book, give MLS a try.

I bought &quot;Telecommunication Technologies&quot; (TT) to expand my knowledge of networking. Although TT covers Frame Relay, DSL, ATM, ISDN, and other systems, it was not reader-friendly. I recommend buying TT only if you can't find the material elsewhere.<br /><br />Since reading James Harry Green's 845-page &quot;Irwin Handbook of Telecommunications&quot; in July 2000, I've looked for a more compact telecom book. John Ross' 384-page TT seemed to be the answer, promising &quot;information needed to develop a complete understanding of the technologies used within telephony, data, and telecommunications networks.&quot; Unfortunately, this book doesn't offer enough accessibility to average readers. TT uses undefined terms and acronymns when explaining new material. It seems to expect a certain level of familiarity with electrical engineering and communication theory, but claims on the back cover to be &quot;uniquely readable.&quot; It mixes material best kept separate; why discuss MAC addresses in a chapter on wide area networks, when MAC addresses best fit with local area networks? Furthermore, the book lacks cohesion and consistency, forcing me to skim half of it for topics worth reading more thoroughly.<br /><br />TT reminded me of articles in 2600 magazine. They often contain lots of good technical data, but the reader is left to sort out how that data applies to his situation. This is acceptable if you're looking for certain technical details of cable modems or ISDN, but not if you're seeking to really understand their operation and relation to other systems. On the positive side, the book features a great collection of clear, complete networking diagrams for many different technologies.<br /><br />When explaining networking and telecommunications, it's not enough to state the facts and press on. As a holder of degrees in English and political science, author John Ross should appreciate his non-electrical engineering audience's need for better introduction, definition, and framing of communications material. Perhaps a strong editor with an eye for organization and detail can help produce a more readable second edition.ng audience's need for better introduction, definition, and framing of communications material.

I read the Windows 2000 Security Handbook (W2KSH) to learn how to advise clients on improving the survivability of their Windows 2000 platforms. Like its predecessor, Tom Sheldon's excellent &quot;Windows NT Security Handbook,&quot; W2KSH delivers practical content in a digestable format.  I recommend Windows 2000 system administrators read and heed this book.<br /><br />Good operating system security books are thorough, educational, and honest; W2KSH is all three.  The authors are not mindless Microsoft prophets -- consider this sample from page 501: &quot;It seems that Microsoft just does not get it when it comes to the need for robust auditing/logging of services... the logging configurations are totally inadequate.&quot;  To deal with these and other deficiencies, W2KSH provides installation, configuration, and deployment recommendations.  This advice, on topics like Active Directory, user and group management, and file systems, equips system administrators to survive hostile network environments.<br /><br />As an intrusion detector, I was most happy to read how the Microsoft security model operates, and what components present the greatest vulnerabilities.  I appreciated explanations of system and discretionary access control lists, and how to effectively employ them.  I learned Microsoft includes Web, FTP, SMTP, and NNTP features in Internet Information Service (IIS).  I also became aware of best practices for secure deployment of a Microsoft infrastructure.<br /><br />W2KSH has a few problems.  Like Microsoft products, its &quot;backwards compatibility&quot; revealed weaknesses.  For example, some text was lifted directly from Shelton's earlier book, but necessary background material was omitted (see pages 86, 88-90, 148).  This issue was awkward but minor.  I also did not leave the book with a strong understanding of the different types of groups in Windows 2000.  Such complexity is not the authors' fault.  They show that the OS' dozens of options leaves plenty of room for misconfiguration, leading to compromise.<br /><br />If you're familiar with general security practices, skip Part I (TCP/IP, threats, countermeasures, and policies).  I recommend the authors mention these topics briefly in the introduction and move the bulk to appendices.  Start with Part II, and keep your highlighter handy.  W2KSH gives balanced insight into the workings of Windows 2000, and helps system administrators and security personnel better understand the opportunities and liabilities of running this operating system.They show that the OS' dozens of options leaves plenty of room for misconfiguration, leading to compromise.<BR> <BR>If you're familiar with general security practices, skip Part I (TCP/IP, threats, countermeasures, and policies).

I read The CERT Guide (TCG) to learn the CERT's priorities for improving security.  If you want an exciting, ground-breaking read, avoid TGC. If you want a likely standard for &quot;due diligence&quot; and &quot;reasonable care,&quot; give this book a try.<br /><br />TGC is built using directive language. Instruction follows instruction: &quot;Do this. Don't do this, etc.&quot; Look beyond the verbage and you'll see lots of sound general advice on operating system hardening, firewall deployment, and detecting/containing intrusions. Note I said &quot;general advice.&quot; While the lack of product-specific techniques will preserve TGC's shelf life, it forces sys admins to check other references for the details.<br /><br />Julia Allen tells us &quot;The most effective way to use this book is as a reference. We do not intend for you to read it from cover to cover.&quot; Also, some material is internally duplicated &quot;for the sake of completeness.&quot; These two factors make me wonder if anyone will ever read TGC in its entirety. I ended up taking Julia's advice and skimmed sections I found useful. Of particular interest was the extensive documentation on TCPDump (pages 376-85). Having used the tool for years, I was happy to see so much detail compiled in one place.<br /><br />This book isn't a security officer's dream come true; that title hasn't been written yet.  TGC is best used preparing a network to meet standards of &quot;due diligence&quot; or &quot;reasonable care.&quot; I am not a lawyer, but this technology-neutral book is perfectly suited as a courtroom reference. Should an organization be sued for failing to adequately protect its computing assets, its lack of adherence to the CERT Guide's standards could prove damaging.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't see many organizations meeting this standard. The documentation called for by TGC may exceed that required of government agencies defending classified systems. A dedicated security policy office would be needed, leaving the security and system admins free to implement technical solutions.<br /><br />If you've got the time, manpower, and know-how to deploy systems according to best practices, don't leave TGC behind. If you're struggling to manage security without those resources, use TGC to convince management you're not meeting industry standards.<br />(Disclaimer:  I received my review copy from the publisher.)stems.

I read this book because I try to learn from authors who have demonstrated expertise in the security field.  I recommend reading &quot;White Hat Security Arsenal&quot; (WHSA) if you are looking for a bridge between the academic/research security world and the practical, hands-on world.  I also recommend it if you want in-depth discussions of the how and why of various security &quot;solutions.&quot;<br />Two aspects of WHSA differentiate it from the competition.  First, the author (Avi) shows he keeps tabs on the security research community, and relates important findings to the reader.  For example, as an intrusion detector I recognized the author's references to papers on &quot;traceback&quot; problems.  For areas I don't monitor closely, like cryptography, Avi explains how certain less publicized protocols and algorithms could benefit users and administrators.  Should I want to progress beyond Avi's discussion, I can follow the links and read the papers he cites.<br />Second, the author delivers content via a &quot;problem-threat-answer&quot; method.  He doesn't simply list technologies.  For example, in chapter 9 Avi asks &quot;Assume that Alice and Bob have session keys for encryption and authentication.  How do they protect their communication?&quot;  Avi then describes the threat (essentially an adversary who controls the network between Alice and Bob).  He continues with a discussion of alternatives (encryption, authentication, etc.) and concludes with a case study (IPSec).  Avi's focus on problems rather than technologies is refreshing.<br />WHSA has a few shortcomings.  A good portion of the book (chapters 4-9) centers on cryptography.  Users who can decipher function notations like &quot;a^y mod p&quot; and so on will be comfortable, but others may cringe.  I also felt a mismatch existed between the explanation of threats (mainly viruses in chapter 3) and the material that followed.  While Avi's discussion of historically important malicious code (Morris worm, Melissa virus, etc.) was useful, it seems to reinforce the uninformed manager's opinion that malicious code is the ultimate threat to computer security.  (DDoS was briefly a concern, but viruses impacting end users gets the most air time.)<br />Overall, WHSA is a good book for security professionals looking to answer the how and why questions.  Avi gives insights on such topics as PGP vs. S/MIME, the drawbacks of Microsoft Passport, and why long-term secret keys should be used to create short-term session keys.  Readers are guided by his problem-threat-solution framework, and have an opportunity to learn of some of the best academic work available.  Given that all of the material is framed with case studies (how to use SSL in a web browser, how to perform back-ups, and so on), most readers will find WHSA valuable.cussion of historically important malicious code (Morris worm, Melissa virus, etc.) was useful, it seems to reinforce the uninformed manager's opinion that malicious code is the ultimate threat to computer security.

I am a graduate of the flagship session of the System Administration, Networking, and Security institute's Forensics, Investigations, and Response Education (SANS FIRE) program.  &quot;Incident Response&quot; (IR) should have been the textbook for that program.  It is the most definitive work I've read on incident response and computer forensics.  I highly recommend every security professional take advantage of this book.<br />IR starts with a revealing case study, and follows through with additional mini-studies and &quot;eye witness reports&quot; based on the authors' experiences.  It provides plenty of clear diagrams and charts to reinforce key points, like the innovative &quot;hard drive layers&quot; outlined in chapter five.  Most every mention of a command line program is followed by an example of that command in action, either via screenshot or text sample.  These examples let readers try similar commands on their own workstations, reinforcing the authors' investigative directions.<br />Beyond the excellent presentation of technical material, IR frames its discussion of incident response and computer forensics in a practical investigative methodology.  My SANS FIRE training repeatedly stressed the importance of documentation, policies, processes, and methodology when performing forensic work worthy of adversarial legal scrutiny.  IR's attention to detail helps investigators collect evidence in a professional, repeatable, forensically sound manner.<br />Having appeared in court to defend their investigations, the authors share their knowledge and emphasize crucial steps to avoid forensic pitfalls.  (An example is a DOS boot floppy's interaction with the DRVSPACE.BIN file.  IR explains how to avoid this issue in detail.)  Falling victim to these pitfalls could give a defense attorney an easy way to clear his client, or at least make certain evidence questionable in court.<br />The book is not perfect.  Several typos indicated somewhat rushed publication, but did not detract from technical accuracy.  I would have liked more material in chapter five on file systems; perhaps another appendix would be useful?<br />Many books and papers describe incident response procedures for UNIX, but few dare to discuss Windows.  Given the predominance of compromised Windows hosts, this book thankfully addresses the Windows response task in a complete and clear manner.  In many cases UNIX and Windows are compared side-by-side, and commands for one OS are explained using equivalents for the other OS.<br />IR provides a durable blend of practical investigative techniques and technical insights.  I predict that investigators will cite the procedures in this book as examples of &quot;best practices&quot; when they defend their actions in court.  I plan to build my company's incident response capability around IR's recommendations.<br />(Disclaimer:  I received my review copy free from Foundstone.)veral typos indicated somewhat rushed publication, but did not detract from technical accuracy.

Here is a sampling of specific excerpts of technically incorrect material. Any odd grammar is a result of directly quoting the book.<br />p. 28: &quot;When a connection is established between two nodes during a TCP session, a three-way handshake is used. The process starts with a one-node TCP request by a SYN/ACK but, and the second node TCP response with a SYN/ACK bit. At this point, as described previously, communication between the two nodes will procede. When there is no more data to send, a TCP node may send a FIN bit, indicating a close control signal. At this intersection, both nodes will close simultaneously.&quot;<br />p. 93: &quot;These first 1,024 ports are reserved for system services; as such, outgoing connections will have port numbers higher than 1023. This means that all incoming packets that communicate via ports higher than 1023 are replies to connections initiated by internal requests.&quot;<br />p. 97: &quot;The crucial issue with port 7's echo service pertains to systems that attempt to process oversized packets... this problem is commonly referred to as the &quot;Ping of Death&quot; attack. Another common deviant to port 7 is known as &quot;Ping Flooding.&quot;<br />p. 19: &quot;Unfortunately, this service [chargen] is vulnerable to a telnet connection that can generate a string of characters with the output redirected to a telnet connection to, for example, port 53 (domain name service (DNS)). In this example, the flood of characters causes an access violation fault in the DNS service, which is then terminated, which, as a result, disrupts name resolution services.&quot;<br />p. 106: &quot;As there are limitations in the development of a standard windows system for UNIX, the word from the Underground indicates that hackers are currently working on exploiting fundamental flaws of this service [news].&quot;<br />p. 107: &quot;When this port [exec] is active, or listening, more often than not the remote execution server is configured to start automatically.

I read &quot;Securing Windows NT/2000 Servers for the Internet&quot; (SWNS) to better advise clients on secure configuration of their Windows platforms.  Stefan's wonderful book is a testament to the fundamental insecurity of stock Windows platforms.  Luckily, his advice transforms vulnerable systems into bastion hosts suitable for deployment on the hostile Internet.<br />SWNS' key insight is the need to cripple many default Windows services in the interest of security.  These troublesome &quot;features&quot; include NetBIOS, the Workstation service, the Server service, and others.  In fact, after creating a bastion host, Stefan says &quot;there's no way of administering it remotely!&quot;  (This is the case because NT's standard remote admin tools, like Event Viewer and Server Manager, require RPC using NetBIOS.)  Thankfully, Stefan provides several options for secure remote administration, like pcAnywhere, Windows 2000 Terminal Services, and open source alternatives (Secure Shell, Virtual Network Computer, etc.)<br />I concur with an earlier review noting the lack of attention for Microsoft's IIS web server.  Hundreds of thousands of Windows machines were recently compromised by the &quot;Code Red&quot; worm, demonstrating two facts.  First, Windows is frequently used to host web servers.  Second, IIS is frequently deployed insecurely.  A second edition of SWNS should add a chapter on configuring IIS.  I was also unhappy with Stefan's dismissal of intrusion detection technology in chapter six.  He should try the Windows port of the open source Snort IDS.<br />Overall, SWNS is a must-buy for Windows administrators.  The book is a quick read, but it explains many aspects of the internal workings of Microsoft's premier operating systems.  As the title implies securing &quot;servers&quot; and not just the underlying operating system, future editions should discuss proper deployment of popular applications for Windows NT/2000, like IIS and Exchange.ndows NT/2000, like IIS and Exchange.	2001-07-28

I read &quot;Real World Linux Security&quot; (RWLS) to learn more about best practices for securing Linux servers.  Author Bob Toxen has clearly &quot;been around the block,&quot; and in some cases he even helped &quot;build&quot; it.  Not everyone had the fortune to study at Berkeley with the giants of UNIX!  While parts of RWLS are too advanced for some (I was overwhelmed at times), it deserves to be read by serious security practioners.<br />Anyone administering Linux systems will learn at least one security improvement from RWLS.  For example, I applied Bob's suggestion to prevent X from listening on the 6000-series TCP ports.  Youngsters will learn why password files incorporate a &quot;salt&quot; and how the &quot;sticky bit&quot; prevents file deletion under certain conditions.  Graybeards may enjoy the tech history, like the origin of the word &quot;spam&quot; for unsolicited commercial email.<br />RWLS' strongest feature is Bob's commitment to defending his security suggestions.  He doesn't just provide instructions.  He states the problem, its origin, how to resolve it, other options, and finally defends his solution.  One might disagree with his conclusions but appreciate his reasoning.<br />Bob can make these arguments because he's comfortable discussing Linux at the user interface level (GUI or command line), at the network level (protocols, sockets, ports) and at the operating system and programming levels (system calls, C programming, etc.)  This reminded me of Radia Perlman's &quot;Interconnections&quot; networking book, where she explains protocols she invented, such as the spanning tree algorithm.<br />RWLS is not perfect.  The &quot;one way credit card data path&quot; proposal needs a diagram.  Page 500's says a &quot;.&quot; in TCPDump means no flags are set, when really &quot;.&quot; means neither the SYN, FIN, RST nor PSH flags are set.  (&quot;.&quot; is frequently seen in TCPDump with the ACK flag, for instance.)  On page 232, I think Bob meant to mention ARP, not RARP.  These are minor errors overshadowed by RWLS' depth of knowledge.<br />Other books can claim to offer &quot;practical&quot; security advice, but I found RWLS to be the first purely defensive-minded book which required one eye on the text and the other on my laptop.  Reading and typing, I added a few more weapons to my defensive arsenal by trying commands and altering system settings.  I plan to reread advanced sections after I learn more about shell scripting and C programming.<br />If you feel you've got nothing more to learn from security books, give Bob Toxen's work a shot.

I read this book to learn best practices for improving the security of my enterprise.  I was very pleased to learn that &quot;Hack Proofing Your E-Commerce Site&quot; (HPYES) was not another &quot;hacking book,&quot; like so many published recently.  HPYES offers a wealth of practical recommendations and solid guidance for anyone responsible for host and network security.<br />Syngress' motto for their &quot;Hack Proofing&quot; series is &quot;The only way to stop a hacker is to think like one.&quot;  That slogan may be true for vulnerability assessment or penetration testing, but it does the material in HPYES a disservice.  This book is less about the thrill of compromise and more about the measured peace of maintaining a well-protected enterprise.<br />HPYES is noteworthy for its mature, reasonable, thorough, and clear approach to explaining security practices.  The diagrams and screen captures are excellent.  The seven authors consistently present topics through the security tenets of confidentiality, integrity, and [availability].  I believe even managers of technical staff would find this book rewarding.<br />My favorite chapters discussed incident response (10), financial transactions (6), and policy (4).  Chapters 6 and 10 were especially enjoyable, as they contained material I hadn't read elsewhere, like descriptions of electronic commerce technologies and a comparison of responses to web site compromise.  (Imagine -- original material in a security book!)<br />HPYES offered a few disappointments.  I was dismayed to see an installation of Apache on Windows, vice UNIX.  Page 336 mentions SSH as &quot;Secured Socket Handler&quot;; I believe the community knows SSH as simply Secure Shell.  Chapter 7 also suffered from awkward English, but compensated by introducing Nessus as a sample vulnerability assessment tool.  Appendix B was probably not needed, as it's just a reprint of &quot;Fast Track&quot; material from individual chapters.<br />Overall, I recommend HPYES to anyone responsible for enterprise network security.  This book won't receive the manufactured hype of  books like &quot;Hack Attacks Revealed&quot; or &quot;Hack Attacks Denied,&quot; but you will quickly recognize the HPYES authors are both skilled practitioners and effective educators.<br />(Disclaimer: I received my review copy free from the publisher.)rial from individual chapters.<br />Overall, I recommend HPYES to anyone responsible for enterprise network security.

My dad is an amateur radio operator, and my grandfather was as well.  I read the 4th edition of &quot;Now You're Talking!&quot; to learn the basics of ham radio and prepare for the Technician license.<br />Over several weeks I carefully studied chapters 1-10, stopping to answer the questions in chapter 12 when directed.  I used the book as a source to make a few notecards on operating frequencies and general electrical engineering principles.  The day of the exam, I reviewed the questions in chapter 12 as a whole, and ensured I could answer each correctly.<br />Without a doubt, this book will prepare you for the Technician exam.  If you analyze the questions asked on the exam, they are all fully covered in the text of chapters 1-10.  Furthermore, the authors are master educators who present clear explanations for every concept.  I found myself with a better understanding of many aspects of radio theory after reading this book, which is more important than simply passing a test!<br />The only aspect of the book which confused me was the discussion of Technician privileges on page 1-11.  The text states &quot;As a Technician, you can use a wide range of frequency bands -- all amateur bands above 30 MHz, in fact.&quot;  On the same page, Table 1-1 shows Technician licenses provide &quot;All amateur privileges above 50.0 MHz.&quot;  Table 1-2 on the next page states &quot;Operators with Technician class licenses and above may operate on all bands above 50 MHz.&quot;  Which is correct, 30 MHz or 50 MHz?<br />Regardless, I give the 4th edition of &quot;Now You're Talking!&quot; my highest recommendation.  At $19 it's a bargain, and it was my sole reference.  I earned a perfect score this morning after studying this book, and I look forward to joining the amateur radio community on the air.	2001-07-07

Some protested its publication, while others welcomed its endorsement of the full disclosure movement.  Sadly, the third edition has become, in the author's words on page 22, &quot;another general Internet security book.&quot;  Few will find it revolutionary.<br />MS:3E features 14 authors, each commendably given credit for their chapters.  Of these, Craig Balding's chapter on UNIX reigns supreme.  For a book labeled &quot;intermediate-advanced,&quot; only Craig's chapter delivers at that level.  I liked his file system risk and kernel rootkit material, and his service-by-service security discussion was great.  In contrast, the chapter on Microsoft's operating systems is mainly a laundry list of outdated exploits.  I also found the virus, Cisco, and security policy chapters useful.  (Note: chapter 7, page 121 -- TCP sequence numbers count BYTES of data, never packets!  This is a common misunderstanding.)<br />Readers seeking no-nonsense product evaluations should look elsewhere.  Bland lists of IDS and firewall packages will neither offend vendors nor offer practical guidance to buyers.  I prefer authors who take a stand, like Paul Proctor or Stephen Northcutt -- even if I disagree with them!<br />MS:3E will not shock the security world as the first edition did.  Too many other security web sites and books have shared &quot;hacking secrets&quot; with the masses.  This condition endorses the Anonymous author's first edition goal, but makes his third edition redundant.  If he plans to write &quot;general security books,&quot; I suggest he continue his theme of OS-specific titles.  (Maximum Linux Security, Second Edition arrives soon, followed by Maximum Windows 2000 Security, First Edition.)  Retire Maximum Security, or write a better general guide after transplanting the OS-specific material to their respective titles.

I have studied the martial arts for several years and ran cross country and indoor/outdoor track in high school.  While I am not yet 30, I believe my lingering lower leg pain is due to poor &quot;stretches&quot; and exercises from earlier years in these activities.  After reading Dr Stark's book, I will make changes in my exercise routine to hopefully prevent further damage.<br />I was shocked to see how many harmful &quot;stretches&quot; Dr Stark describes were taught by my coaches.  Many trainers have no idea their desire to improve the conditioning of their athletes can cause long-term physical damage.  (Guess what, coach?  It's physically impossible to stretch the Achilles Tendon!  Also, I can't stretch my hamstrings by standing, then bending over!)<br />Dr Stark clues the reader in to fundamental, powerful ideas, such as &quot;loaded muscles can't stretch.&quot;  Only relaxed muscles can stretch.  Bouncing only causes muscles to cease relaxing.<br />I agree with an earlier reviewer that Dr Stark should address upper body stretching.  While many of Dr Stark's patients' complaints are caused by lower extremity problems, athletes need sound upper body guidance too.<br />Be forewarned on the content of this book.  While it rates 224 pages, some of the material is repetitive, the font is huge, and sometimes only a few paragraphs appear on a single page.  Still, the amount of whitespace doesn't detract from the depth of material.  The diagrams are clear and the recommended stretches are easy to follow.<br />Anyone who seeks to learn how to properly prepare for athletics, and wishes to remain fit for life, will enjoy Dr Stark's book.	2001-06-11

I am a senior engineer for network security operations, and fairly new to Linux.  I bought this 2nd edition of LA:ABG to gain familiarity with installing, configuring, and optimizing Red Hat Linux 7, specifically.  Steve has written THE book for beginning Linux system administrators, and I heartily recommend it.<br />LA:ABG never wavers from its primary goal: to give new sys admins the knowledge to build and maintain Linux services.  The novelty of this &quot;beginner's guide&quot; is Steve's belief that &quot;beginner&quot; does not equal &quot;GUI.&quot;  Steve explains each service using its command line interface, since that may be the only available interface in an emergency.  He also explains how to compile each software package from source, useful when one needs to upgrade or replace applications.<br />I was surprised by the number of helpful commands and options packed into this 2nd edition.  Even when I knew a command, Steve added a new twist; use ps -auxww vice ps -aux for process listings, or netstat -natup vice netstat -a for active sockets.  I repeatedly wondered if Steve hadn't read my mind before writing LA:ABG, since most questions were answered seconds after I formed them.  Steve also explains new aspects of the 2.4 kernel and Red Hat 7 (xinetd, iptables, etc.) that other so-called &quot;Red Hat 7&quot; books neglect.<br />On the down side, the book had a few typos, and pages 527-8 seem to misinterpret TCPDump output.  I would have liked more information on SSH, too.  Be aware that the book is Red Hat-oriented, since it contains a &quot;publisher's edition&quot; of RH 7.  Workarounds for other distros are given, and Steve even criticizes certain aspects of Red Hat's file structure!<br />If you're new to Linux, and not the sort who buys &quot;Dummies&quot; books, definitely read LA:ABG, 2nd edition.  It is the best introductory Linux book I've read, and is strong enough to satisfy novices and intermediate-level users.<br />(Disclaimer: I received my review copy free from the publisher.)review copy free from the publisher.)	2001-05-28

I probably first heard the term &quot;hacker&quot; when &quot;War Games&quot; was released in 1983.  I read Steven's book because it is an early but enlightening account (first published in 1984) of the Hacker Ethic.<br />Consider: in a closed, self-policed environment, like the computer labs of the 1960s and early 1970s, freely sharing information makes sense.  In an open, under-policed environment, like the modern Internet, deviants abuse the Hacker Ethic.  Well-intentioned &quot;white hats&quot; may explore the phone system purely to understand its operation, but evil-minded &quot;black hats&quot; abuse the same knowledge to make free long distance calls.  Does this mean information should be confined?  No -- full disclosure is still the best way to counter black hat activity.<br />Steven lays the groundwork for these thoughts, and serves up gems from hacker history.  His 1970s quote from Popular Electronics editor Les Solomon is the earliest reference I know linking hacking to kung fu: &quot;The computer is...an art form.  It's the ultimate martial art.&quot;  Steven also shares tales of Sierra On-Line, Apple Corp., Homebrew Computer Club, the Altair, and even Bill Gates' 1975 rant against software piracy.<br />&quot;Hackers&quot; will make you appreciate your unlimited access to the machine on which you're reading this review.  Hackers of the 1960s and 1970s would have given their first born child to possess the power and availability of modern PCs; now we take PCs for granted, like indoor plumbing or refrigeration!<br />Those who lived the early days of PCs will enjoy Steven's trip down memory lane.  Those who are younger will discover the true meaning of the word &quot;hacker&quot; -- one who promotes access, freedom, decentralization, meritocracy, art, and joy through computers.	2001-05-13

I read this book because it compares and contrasts telephone, Internet, and ATM networks.  I also have a general interest in learning how networks operate.  I concentrate on security, but I realize knowing more about networks in general helps my intrusion detection work.  I strongly recommend reading this book if you develop or research networking products.  Less focused readers will quickly become overwhelmed, as I was!<br />Mr. Keshav states &quot;the bulk of this book is written at a level suitable for first-year graduate students in computer science or electrical engineering.&quot;  He is not kidding!  While Mr. Keshav does an excellent job discussing technical material, the extreme level to which he takes explanations demands a very dedicated reader.  I was happy enough to learn of the many trade-offs required for sound network device design.  Once Mr. Keshav began illuminating exactly how some technologies work (with theorems, equations, and statistics), I began skimming.<br />My favorite sections included chapters 1 through 4, the &quot;basic&quot; material introducing telephone, Internet, and ATM networks.  Chapters 5 (Protocol Layering), 6 (System Design) and 7 (Multiple Access) were also good.  Beyond chapter 7 (with some exceptions), I found the material deeper than the interest level I have as a security professional.<br />Some may wonder about the relevance of a book written in 1996 to current networking practice.  I believe the bulk of the text remains useful, since it uses technological examples to frame underlying design approaches.  Furthermore, Mr. Keshav provides a way to think about networks by defining crucial terms and concepts in clear terms.  These definitions are reinforced by excellent summaries, tables, and glossaries.<br />&quot;An Engineering Approach&quot; provides an incredible number of answers to the &quot;why&quot; questions of telephone, Internet, and ATM networking.  Other books will give mainly the &quot;what&quot; or sometimes &quot;how.&quot;  &quot;What&quot; is enough for doing daily admin, &quot;how&quot; is enough to improve network performance, and &quot;why&quot; is needed to build better networks.

I read this book to learn more about security technologies associated with products by Cisco, Microsoft, and other vendors.  (I also try to read a variety of computer security books.)  If you're planning to deploy Cisco routers, Microsoft Proxy Servers, or Raptor / Checkpoint / Pix firewalls, give this book a try.  If not, you may find the first few chapters worthy nonetheless.<br />&quot;Mission Critical&quot; strictly adheres to the defender's point of view, whereas books like &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; demonstrate security by describing the attacker's perspective.  Chris Brenton's &quot;Mastering Network Security&quot; (Sybex, 1999) is my favorite &quot;defensive&quot; book, although I bet his new book &quot;Active Defense&quot; (Sybex, 2001) will be the king of this category.  &quot;Mission Critical's&quot; focus on the Microsoft world at the expense of UNIX operating systems is a weakness, unlike the even-handed attention in Brenton's books.<br />My favorite section in &quot;Mission Critical&quot; is chapter 4, &quot;Internet Security Applications,&quot; which describes cryptography, digital signatures, SSL, SSH, PGP, S/MIME, and Kerberos.  The authors give just enough detail to explain how these technologies work without being boring or repetitive.  Chapter 3, &quot;IPSec,&quot; is instructive, and I also think chapter 8, &quot;Cisco IOS,&quot; delivers plenty of content.<br />The book's main weakness (other than failure to give UNIX enough attention) is its lack of cohesiveness.  I could tell several writers were involved, each with a different opinion as to what &quot;layer 3&quot; or &quot;layer 4&quot; means, for example.  (This matters; are we talking OSI or &quot;DoD&quot; TCP/IP?  If &quot;DoD&quot; TCP/IP, is the bottom layer &quot;network&quot; as listed on page 22 or &quot;host-to-host&quot; as on page 157?  And doesn't &quot;network&quot; usually refer to layer 3 in the OSI model, anyway?)

I read this second edition to gain insights into ways to better assess a client's security posture, and also to understand some of the attacks I see while monitoring intrusion detection systems.  Of the books I've read, Hacking Exposed remains the best guide to systematically assess and (if necessary) compromise hosts.  By understanding black hat methods, defenders can better prepare for the tidal wave of exploits washing upon the networking shore.<br />Parts I (Casing the Establishment), II (System Hacking), and III (Network Hacking) are a tour-de-force of attacker tools and techniques.  While explaining how to penetrate systems, the authors spend a fair amount of time explaining how those systems work.  From a system administration standpoint, these descriptions are pure gold.  Since the authors are fairly operating system-agnostic, they show the pros and cons of Microsoft, UNIX, and Novell products in the harsh light of improved security.  For example, the discussion of file handles, file descriptors, and signals in chapter 8 (&quot;Hacking UNIX&quot;) helped me understand a little bit of UNIX's guts, while giving a security spin to file system operations.<br />Thankfully, Hacking Exposed gives Microsoft operating systems plenty of attention.  While recognizing that many of us dislike administering these systems, the authors provide helpful and solid chapters on Windows NT and Windows 2000.  They also demonstrate many ways to use Windows as an attack platform.  They convincingly show that if a scan can be performed in Linux, someone has developed a similar tool for Windows.<br />My favorite issues in the book involved describing Windows rootkits (a recent development) and UNIX loadable kernel modules.  On the negative side, I felt the book lost steam in section IV (Software Hacking), spending too much time repeating earlier material.  Also, unless you're a relative newbie to security, you may become bored with the litany of historic deficiencies and required patches discussed in section IV.<br />Overall, the second edition of Hacking Exposed remains a must-read book for security professionals.  I recommend it as the sort of book one reads after gaining an overall sense of the security field and learning about TCP/IP.  With those foundations in place, it's time to learn how black hats operate.  If you're a system administrator, you'll learn how to fortify your network assets.

I administer systems which use cryptographic tools and processes (SSH, IPSec VPNs, etc.) and have seen cryptography hinder my network-based intrusion detection activities.  I read this book to gain basic familiarity with the nuts and bolts of cryptography.  I wanted a lively text which addressed modern issues, since computer books can be quickly overtaken by technological advances.  This book delivers at all levels and belongs on every computer security professional's bookshelf.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was energetic, clear, well-organized, fully illustrated, and comprehensive.  I believe it's THE book to read if you want an introduction to one of the major enablers of modern computing.  Furthermore, because the book's goal is to explain the foundations of both secret and public key cryptography, it should stay relevant for many years.<br />&quot;Cryptography Decrypted&quot; does not spare any effort to ensure the reader understands the subject.  Concepts are clarified and reinforced through text and diagrams on nearly every page.  The authors know many readers are not attracted to mathematics, so they move the &quot;heavy lifting&quot; to an appendix.  Even then, for readers willing to apply a little effort, the appendix is understandable and enlightening.  At every stage of writing this book, the authors must have remembered to keep the non-cryptographer reader in mind.  Kudos to their editors for keeping them on track!<br />The only disappointment was the book's failure to mention the Secure Shell (SSH).  Because the authors believed it important to discusses popular implementations of cryptography (IPSec, SSL, PGP), I had hoped that SSH would be included.  Most every UNIX sys admin is familiar with SSH, and might have enjoyed learning more about the guts of this indispensable tool.<br />I don't often give 5 star reviews; only 3 of my last 10 merited that rating.

I bought this book to gain familiarity with installing, configuring, and optimizing Red Hat Linux 7, specifically.  I recommend this book as a reference, but don't rely on it too heavily if you need information on kernel 2.4 features.  Since Red Hat Linux 7 installs 2.2.16-22 by default, with a pre-2.4 kernel as an option, this situation is understandable.<br />The book seems marketed to more advanced users, with the words &quot;from knowledge to mastery&quot; on the cover and the warning &quot;user level: intermediate-advanced&quot; on the back.  However, I would place the book squarely in the beginner-intermediate bracket.  There's far too much introductory material to qualify this book as an advanced guide to Red Hat Linux.  For the sake of completeness, I appreciate the authors' inclusion of basic material.  As a beginner, I was &quot;introduced&quot; and not &quot;overwhelmed.&quot;  Gurus, though, will want to look elsewhere.<br />Chapter 24, Linux C/C++ Programming Tools, was my favorite section.  The concepts in this chapter seemed central to the Linux experience.  I was surprised to see &quot;make&quot; and &quot;gcc&quot; explained so late (pages 772-3) in a book of this size.  Most parts of the book recommend installing software using rpm's.  When rpm's are not available, the guidance in chapter 24 can be critical.  Chapter 27, Configuring and Building Kernels, was also significant for the same reasons.<br />Being a security professional, I was not surprised by chapter 23, System Security.  To address this topic more thoroughly, I plan to read Bob Toxen's book.<br />The bottom line is this: Red Hat Linux 7 Unleashed is a solid work, but it's probably better titled &quot;Red Hat Linux 7 Introduced.&quot;  I'm sure the authors (who are all very Linux-savvy) could write a more advanced follow-up.	2001-03-16

When I first saw this book's title, I realized I lacked an understanding of XHTML, XML, Java, and other subjects listed in the table of contents.  The book's 2.5 inch thickness and 1400 pages were daunting, but skimming the first few chapters showed the text to be lively and informative.  I gambled that I could at least gain some familiarity with modern Web technologies by buying this book.<br />That gamble paid in spades.  This book will provide a computer-familiar reader an idea of the plumbing behind modern Web sites.  The text describes many varieties of Web-building tools, and includes clear explanations, examples, and code.  I especially enjoyed learning from the book's dozens of figures.  These typically show the results of executing example code, with the captions giving excellent summaries of points made in the text.  For example, rather than writing &quot;Here is a sample of Netscape Dynamic HTML layers,&quot; the caption on p. 684 says &quot;Netscape Dynamic HTML layers can be used to show context-sensitive information on your Web pages.&quot;<br />I could not find any faults with this book, although Web development is not my specialty.  If you are looking for a book to make you an expert in any one or two of the subjects covered (i.e., JavaScript, Dynamic HTML, even XHMTL), you will not be satisfied.  The authors recognize this point and direct focused readers to more comprehensive sources.  If you are looking for a guide to what makes Web surfing and serving work at a technical level, I strongly recommend this book.  Keep in mind that rapidly evolving Web processes can make books like this less relevant as time passes.  If you believe this particular edition is becoming obsolete, be confident that the authors' next edition will be just as educational.<br />Note:  I congratulate the editors and four authors for creating a &quot;cohesive&quot; 1400 page book.  I was pleased to see each chapter explicitly bearing the individual author's name, and glad to see seamless references to work in chapters by different co-authors.

I am a network intrusion detector building and deploying FreeBSD-based sensors for use at work and home.  I am trying to augment my &quot;end user&quot; perspective with an administrator's skill set.  I was anxious to add to my limited knowledge of installing and configuring FreeBSD.<br />Ted says his book &quot;is written for beginning FreeBSD administrators,&quot; and has &quot;operating with the Microsoft operating system and networking as a primary goal.&quot;  This is true.  The perfect reader is comfortable with installing and manipulating FreeBSD, but is not sure how best to implement FreeBSD-based email, web, print, or Windows share serving.  Newbies will not find enough hand-holding, and gurus on a man-page diet may not be satisfied.<br />A unique aspect of the book is its analysis of Microsoft's products.  With a FreeBSD bias, Ted is not afraid to lift up the Microsoft rock and show the bugs scurrying underneath.  Windows devotees might welcome some of his hints on administering Microsoft's email products!<br />This 400-page book devotes substantial sections to non-BSD topics like advocacy and history (40+ pages), router configuration, and general email services, which didn't bother me.  Similar to Rod Smith's approach in The Multi-Boot Configuration Handbook, inclusion of material beyond strict FreeBSD configuration helps build well-rounded system administrators.  Those needing more detail and explicit instructions would probably wish for less history and more command-line configuration.<br />The strongest feature is the author's breadth of knowledge and devotion to linking FreeBSD to multiple Microsoft OS products.  Who needs to run TCP/IP on DOS, and have it talk to FreeBSD?  If you do, check out this book!  (Fond memories of installing Trumpet Winsock on Windows 3.1 in 1994 resurfaced while reading p. 56.)  The weakest aspect is the book's implicit assumption that the reader is the type who is comfortable reading manual pages.  While Ted may seem to be looking out for the newbie (explaining the term &quot;shell,&quot; even, on page 18), I still felt the tug of the man page.<br />I hope this book is successful and encourages updates to Greg Lehey's &quot;The Complete FreeBSD&quot; and inspires other FreeBSD gurus to write their own books.

I applaud their intentions, but the uneven analysis and commentary warrants faint praise.  New analysts flying solo should not read this book.  Analysts with a guru to consult should get his or her input before trusting the book's interpretations.<br />Examples:  (1) Eric Hacker expertly discusses a Windows password problem on pp. 77-85, but a significant trace is missing on p. 81.  This causes the following dozen traces to not match their respective explanations.  Would a new analyst notice?  (2) Several times (p. 87, etc.) the authors fail to realize &quot;public&quot; is a common default SNMP &quot;read&quot; community string, while &quot;private&quot; is the &quot;read/write&quot; counterpart.  This mistake is crucial elsewhere in the book.  (3) The editors call a clear example of round-trip-time determination a &quot;half-open DNS scan.&quot;  It's ok for certification students to make judgement errors, but SANS editors should explain why that view isn't correct.  (4) A very questionable &quot;SYN flood&quot; trace in ch. 10 doesn't match the &quot;reproduction&quot; of the same trace in the question-and-answer appendix -- that one's missing a crucial packet!  (5) A &quot;spoofed FTP request&quot; in ch.11 looks like an active FTP data attempt to me.  That concept is explained on p. 329, but the authors don't apply the same reasoning to ch.11's example. Why?<br />On the positive side, I was impressed by Mark Cooper's work on buffer overflows and ICMP redirects.  Some of the student work is also first-rate, but it may be tough for new readers to make the necessary distinctions.<br />The authors owe it to the target audience (new analysts) to deliver accurate explanations.  Different interpretations are expected, but errors like those listed require scrutiny.  The work is sincere --  I just can't recommend this book to inexperienced intrusion detectors.e listed require scrutiny.

This book should be in every intrusion detector's library!<br />New co-authors Judy Novak and Donald McLachlan add to Stephen<br />Northcutt's original wisdom, with insight on filters and advanced<br />analysis of ICMP.  The RPC chapter is characteristically informative,<br />while the inclusion of useful yet aging &quot;front-line&quot; stories<br />keeps the reading lively.<br />Still, I expected more.  As a new analyst<br />who read the 1st ed. in mid-1999, I published a rebuttal of Stephen's<br />theories.  Now, slightly more experienced, I recognize other areas<br />need similar scrutiny.  For example, chapters 7 and 13 imply<br />&quot;login ports associated with trusted relationships&quot; make<br />good SYN flood targets, when really forged connections to those ports<br />are the problem.  This is and other subtle technical points need<br />clarification.  A 2nd example: ch. 7 says &quot;The signature of TCP<br />hijacking is that the IP addresses change during a TCP session, while<br />the sequence numbers remain correct.&quot; This doesn't match my<br />experience with session hijacking.<br />The book's arrangement could be<br />improved; I prefer the clear taxonomy of Hacking Exposed. Basics<br />should also be separated from advanced material to satisfy newbies and<br />gurus.  I encourage New Riders to publish an errata page on the Web<br />(with room for reader input), as minor errors could be quickly erased<br />by a second printing.  This book is still the best available, but I<br />hope for more from the 3rd ed. and other ambitious authors!	2001-02-03

Previously, during 6 1/2 years in the Air Force, I studied in schools teaching Wah Lum kung fu, tae kwon do, modern arnis, and wing tsun, and dabbled in small circle jujitsu, ground fighting, and tai chi.  (I tried a little shotokan karate and judo in college earlier.)  American Kenpo, as presented by my current instructor and in Mr. Wedlake's book, is the most enjoyable system yet.<br />Mr. Wedlake roughly covers the following: - What is kenpo, and who was Ed Parker? - Set a goal, select a school, how to be a student - Class structure, student responsibilities, and how to practice - Kenpo techniques and cultural impact on the arts - Attitude/philosophy - The gi, belt, and testing - Women, children, and seniors - Street fighting, seminars, associations, competitions, and demos - Instructor footnotes and rules of motion<br />The book is short (157 pages) and can be read in two or three sittings.  I was tempted to blast through it in one, but letting the lessons within sink in requires some time for reflection.  The material mirrored much of what I've been learning in class, and helpfully illustrated and reinforced techniques and theories.  As kenpo is a very logical system, it is suitable for the analysis presented in books like this.  It is not a series of attack - response scenarios, like most martial arts books in my library.  Rather, it explains the ideas behind kenpo and its associated practices, filling a gap left by some other authors.<br />Having been a student of Ed Parker Sr., Mr. Wedlake brings many personal stories to the book.  He answers many &quot;why&quot; questions, such as why newly promoted students are struck in a good-natured manner upon receiving their belts.  (I'm sure this will surprise non-martial artists.  I first saw this aspect of kenpo in Jeff Speakman's movies.)<br />This volume is a must-read if you are a kenpo student.  Serious practioners from other styles with any interest in kenpo will find it useful, too.  I'm looking forward to your next book, Mr. Wedlake!us practioners from other styles with any interest in kenpo will find it useful, too.

I am a network security engineer who hoped to find a concise volume on networking and security, suitable for review by my colleagues and students.  I was disappointed.  The book is haphazard, poorly edited, and written at less than a professional level.  While the chapter on choosing an ISP is helpful, it can't carry the whole volume.  I dislike writing 2-star reviews, but my overall goal is to give straight advice to Amazon.com customers and technical security professionals.<br />First, the authors and their editors should realize &quot;thus,&quot; &quot;therefore,&quot; and &quot;rather&quot; are not conjunctions, and &quot;however&quot; as used in the text isn't a conjunction either.  The frequent joining of sentences by these adverbs annoyed me.  I expected more from the co-author with a degree in English literature.  Second, attempts to sound cute fall flat.  Page 21 says &quot;The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is one of the most popular protocols in the TCP/IP stack.  But you don't need us to tell you that.&quot;  Indeed, why bother writing it in a &quot;Concise Guide&quot;?  Third, the book lacked enough diagrams to illustrated key points, and some figures weren't clear.  Where in figure 2.10 are we told that &quot;8 | 7 | 6 etc...&quot; mean bits?<br />Beyond syntax and style, I found technical errors.  In chapter 3 the authors repeatedly misname a SYN flood as a &quot;TCP SYN scan.&quot;  They mislabel their three-way handshake figure, and don't understand the true victim of the DoS in figure 3.2.  On page 71 they say &quot;The intruder gains access to your system usually by installing a series of Trojan-horse programs collectively known as a root kit... The Trojan programs allow normally untraceable access, so there is not as much sanitizing that the intruder must do to cover his tracks.&quot;  This is false or at least muddled.  A root kit is known in the industry as a set of post-compromise tools used to clean logs, Trojanize binaries, and open alternate back doors.  A root kit is not traditionally used to gain initial access, although &quot;one-stop-shopping&quot; tools might include cradle-to-grave exploitation.<br />On the positive side, the chapter on choosing an ISP was informative.  I enjoyed seeing various WAN technologies discussed together, too.  Unfortunately, this could not compensate for the confused and hurried material found elsewhere.  I recommending avoiding this book until stronger literary and technical editors publish a second edition.back doors.

Scott's book is absolutely first-rate, written in a clear, friendly style that keeps the reader's attention.  Backing up the technical content, the book offers plenty of history and answers to the &quot;why?&quot; questions asked when learning network protocols.  For example, why do various Ethernet frame formats exist (Ethernet/DIX/Ethernet II vs. IEEE 802.3 w/LLC Header vs. IEEE 802.3 w/LLC SNAP extension)?  Short answer -- blame IBM!  Long answer -- read pages 82-86.<br />The logically arranged material makes Scott's book a powerful learning tool.  After introducing protocol analysis in chapter 1, he devotes a full chapter to each of the seven layers of the OSI model.  (No, he doesn't skip the session and presentation layers!)  By taking a layered approach, Scott compares same-layer protocols and makes each understandable in context (i.e., DNS vs. NetBIOS vs. Netware SAP, all at layer 5 -- somewhat controversially; DNS at layer 5?)  Chapter 9 finishes with advice on measuring latency and throughput.  I learned something new about protocols at each layer, even after reading many authoritative TCP/IP volumes.  For example, Scott's explanation of NetBIOS as a session protocol and Server Message Block (SMB) as an application protocol finally made it clear how these standards interact on Windows networks.  The text is backed up by numerous screen captures of protocol decodes, adding to the learning value.<br />....The few typos or mistakenly omitted material do not detract from the book's overall message.  If you've read Richard Stevens, Eric Hall, etc., and you think you've run out of resources for understanding network traffic, give Scott's book a try.  You'll be informed and pleasantly surprised!	2000-12-18

I constantly search for sources of information useful to front-line security personnel, and I rate books against that standard.<br />&quot;Inside Internet Security&quot; is a book managers and new security workers would find enlightening.  I would not recommend it for anyone who's been &quot;in the trenches&quot; for 6-12 months or more.  The content can be found in many other works and I did not learn anything new, save for minor trivia, such as the fact the AS/4000 includes an integrated firewall on a separate coprocessor card (p. 84).<br />This does not mean the book is without merit.  Its length (250 pages) will not scare readers away, and its range of topics provide a solid introduction to the security realm.  Still, this book isn't really about &quot;what hackers don't want you to know,&quot; since the material is relatively basic.  Books like &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; probably come closer to explaining specific techniques for penetrating networks.  I'm afraid what hackers really don't want &quot;white-hats&quot; to know isn't in print, either on paper or on the Internet.	2000-11-10

I've seen Bruce speak twice and he never fails to impress.  &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot; is no different.  This book is not designed to teach readers about the latest security technologies.  It was not written to promote specific products, although Bruce explains how the book's themes caused him to revamp his Counterpane firm.  What the book does is teach security professionals how to think about their craft.  I would recommend it to everyone in the field from day one, but its deeper meanings would probably not be evident until a year's work on the front lines.<br />Some of the ideas aren't new.  For example, I've heard members of the L0pht petition for a software Underwriter's Lab for years, and others have encouraged liability laws for software vendors.  Bruce builds on these ideas and weaves them into his own prescription for dealing with complex and inherently insecure systems.  This is the type of book that gives a professional the vocabulary and framework to organize his understanding of the security process.  &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot; creates the &quot;little voice&quot; that warns against a vendor's promises to solve all your problems with a $30,000 box-of-wonders.<br />Of particular interest to me, after training in economics, is Bruce's insistence that &quot;the buying public has no way to differentiate real security from bad security.&quot;  It logicially follows that the market cannot address this problem, since &quot;perfect information&quot; does not exist.  Therefore, outside organizations (perhaps an FDA for software?) should get involved, but not by outlawing reverse engineering and security tools.<br />I give five stars to books that make the complex simple, that reveal and enhance technical details, or that change the way I look at the world.  This book fits two, and possibly three of those categories.  Bravo, Bruce.	2000-10-29

I am the officer technical lead for a 50-person military intrusion  detection operation.  Paul spoke at the SANS 2000 Technical Conference on  25 March 2000, right before I gave my own presentation.  Even though Paul  emphasized a host-based ID view, and I have network-based lineage, I found  his insight and experience impressive.  His new book demonstrates those  qualities in spades.  Chapter 6, &quot;Intrusion Detection Myths,&quot; is  particularly helpful, and his statement that &quot;There is no such thing  as a false positive&quot; rings true.<br />An outstanding feature of the  book is Paul's discussion of operational models for intrusion detection.  Too many organizations (including my own military unit) believe intrusion  detection involves little more than deploying and monitoring sensors.  Paul  encourages the reader to develop policy, requirements, expectations, legal  considerations, and other facets of operation before spending a penny on  intrusion detection products.<br />The main negatives for this book involve  a rushed-to-production look in some places.  For example, Appendix B:  Commercial Intrusion Detection Vendors, is labelled on pages 338 - 346 as  &quot;Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Vibration Damping, 1.1 Introduction&quot;.  Minor errors appear elsewhere.  They do not detract from the book's  content, and I believe the next printing should correct these typos.<br />This  book has earned its place as the second &quot;must-have&quot; intrusion  detection book, in my opinion.  The first remains &quot;Network Intrusion  Detection&quot; by Northcutt and Novak.  While Paul's book is not a manual  for front-line operatives, it will help transform your intrusion detection  mission into a world-class operation.	2000-09-17

I am the officer technical lead for a 50-person military intrusion  detection operation.  I am also working with a team redesigning one  service's enterprise-wide communication and security infrastructure, for  whom firewalls are a key concern.  &quot;Building Internet Firewalls&quot;  will challenge your concept of how firewalls are created and operated.  The  authors do not limit their discussion to single box firewall solutions  offered by most commercial vendors.  Instead, they present alternative  approaches and explain their strengths and weaknesses in an unbiased  manner.  Furthermore, the reader is treated to 330 pages (chapters 14-23)  of the clearest, most concise guide to network protocols I've encountered.  (I recommend Eric Hall's Internet Core Protocols and forthcoming Internet  Application Protocols for greater detail.)  From an intrusion detector's  standpoint, this information on protocol features, ports, and  characteristics is invaluable, and may solve a few mysteries.  The author's  attention to Windows as well as UNIX technologies is welcome, although most  readers will share the author's frustration with certain Windows protocols.

I am the officer technical lead for a 50-person military intrusion detection operation.  I read Mr Green's book to get a broader understanding of the telecom world, of which network intrusion detection occupies a small  but highly visible part.  This immense book (774 pages of text, plus URLs,  acronyms, and a glossary) addressed nearly every topic I had encountered  reading communications magazines, speaking with the telecom industry, and  researching the Web.  While no single book can provide the depth needed for  truly understand a specific technology, Mr Green's work provided the  foundation for future research.  For example, after getting the context for  SS7, I may now buy &quot;Signalling System #7, 3rd Edition&quot; by Travis  Russell.  I didn't give the book five stars, as I was not completely  comfortable absorbing the material.  This is the sort of book that requires  you to read the whole book twice in order to appreciate the early chapters.  References to technologies like ATM or frame relay in the first half of  the book make much more sense after reading chapters dedicated to those  issues.  If Mr Green had given me slightly more to grasp while reading the  early material, or had perhaps organized the book with the telecom novice  in mind, I may have given five stars.  Nevertheless, if you're looking for  one-stop shopping for telecommunications, I highly recommend this book.  Don't be fooled by the &quot;business&quot; classification on the dust  jacket -- this book is a technical volume, with protocol headers and other  details included.  Great work Mr Green!	2000-07-29

In the  summer of 1999, this book brought my knowledge of TCP/IP from the  memorization and recognition stages to the comprehension and application  stages.  While some material is far too deep in the weeds (SNMP, for  example), the vast majority of the book caters to any intermediate student  of TCP/IP and/or network based intrusion detection.  I was lucky enough to  exchange emails with Richard before he died on 1 Sep 99, and I grieved the  loss to his family and to the Internet community.  This book and his other  volumes remain as testaments to his educational ability.	2000-06-18

Anyone interested in building a training  program for a mostly UNIX shop would find the underlying structure and most  material of the book extremely useful.  While works dealing with standards  tend to weather well, like Richard Stevens' &quot;TCP/IP Illustrated&quot;  series, this book may be showing its age.

Many other books explaining security and  vulnerabilities followed, backed up by corporate-like public resources,  like SecurityFocus.com.  Now that security professionals are relying upon  public databases, and tend to share information more freely, it's not  necessary to spend lots of time reading specific vulnerability descriptions  in &quot;Maximum Security.&quot;  I still appreciate the author's candor  and courage.  I look forward to the third edition, which will hopefully  spend less pages cataloging exploits, while still explaining the root  causes behind them.	2000-06-18
US	49796397	R1IKYSRP8590C0	1565923227	610378784	TCP/IP Network Administration	Books	5	19	19	N	N	Another excellent contribution to the O'Reilly Empire	I am responsible for a 50+ person intrusion detection mission, and I read this book in February 2000 to supplement my knowledge of TCP/IP.  Like other great technical books, this volume manages to educate the reader on  subjects related to TCP/IP, while still covering the main material  thoroughly.  (I place Rod Smith's &quot;Multi-Boot Configuration Handbook  in this category as well.)  This is the type of book that tempts you to  highlight chunks of text on every page.  Keep in mind the audience is a  system administrator, so theory is supplemented by suggested best practices  and configuration options.  I'm looking forward to an updated version of  the Windows version of TCP/IP Network Administration -- any publication  dates available, Craig?	2000-06-18

I bought this book for two reasons.  First, I did not believe I was &quot;ready&quot; for Richard Stevens'  &quot;TCP/IP Illustrated&quot; books.  (That was probably not true.)  Second, I was looking for a book with traces of network packets, linking an  explanation to raw hex.  After reading this book, Stevens' Volume 1, and  Eric Hall's &quot;Core Internet Protocols,&quot; I would not recommend Mr.  Siyan's book, unless you plan to be an error detective.  Like an earlier  reviwer, I too spent a LOT of time discovering and correcting errors.  While this did teach me some material in a &quot;novel&quot; way, I would  not subject the introductory reader to such treatment.  Now that Eric  Hall's book has been published, readers can look for explanations and  packet traces in a practically error-free book, rather than figuring it out  themselves. (That removes reason 2 for buying the book.) Still, I do give  &quot;Inside TCP/IP&quot; three stars for its good coverage of the protocol  and useful diagrams.  Buyer beware, however!	2000-06-18

Had I not read Stephen Northcutt's &quot;Network Intrusion Detection,&quot; I may not have given Dr. Amoroso's work three  stars.  Unfortunately, by catering to a niche audience (probably graduate  students), this book is not very helpful to folks under fire from malicious  Internet users.  Dr. Amoroso is very respected in the field, but I would  have preferred less process charts and taxonomy descriptions.  The  publisher does a disservice by stating on the back cover &quot;System  administrators, programmers, system and software engineers, and managers of  technology will find this book invaluable.&quot;  Had the book been  advertised as a college text, I would have been less critical.  Sorry Dr.  Amoroso -- I look forward to your next book, though!	2000-06-18

He would probably agree that no single book or combination of books will produce a security  &quot;expert.&quot;  Regardless, I was surprised at the scope of material  and Chris' ability to explain it well.  I am trying to broaden my security  horizons beyond intrusion detection, and I found this book well organized,  logical, and amazingly pertinent almost two years since it was written.  I  found what I believe are very minor errors (e.g., details of a FIN scan),  but I can't fault anyone who attempts to capture so much information in one  volume.  I will recommend my intrusion detection analysts add this book to  their reading lists.  Thanks Chris!	2000-06-15

I am responsible for a 50+ person intrusion detection mission, and I've recommend this volume to each new analyst since I read it in Oct 99.  The is one of the few mainstream publications which methodically and clearly  steps through the process of exploiting an Internet target.  I am surprised  earlier reviewers wanted more how-to information -- just how detailed does  it have to be?  For example, if some folks I watched last fall trying  RDS/MDAC exploits had followed the author's examples, they would have done  more than deface web sites.  While books detailing exploits risk instant  obsolescence -- notice &quot;Maximum Security&quot; will release edition 3  soon -- this work maintains the proper balance between tech and theory.  For new security personnel, &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; provides a logical  and easy-to-follow reference; older hands will enjoy pointing to the book  when new folks ask questions!  Thanks Stuart, Joel, and George!	2000-06-15

I can't learn enough about how TCP/IP packets appear at the hex and bit level.  Call me crazy.  That's what my job in network intrusion detection requires, so I appreciate authors like Richard Stevens and Eric Hall.  These folks bring the details of TCP/IP to life, so I can apply that  understanding to suspicious traffic.  Eric's approach focuses on network  monitor traces, nicely complementing Richard's TCPDumps.  I would recommend  checking O'Reilly's web site for the latest errata, even though none of the  errors are enough to detract from this excellent reference work.  I am  actually more interested in seeing the companion volume, &quot;Internet  Application Protocols,&quot; as this is where some of the attack action  occurs these days.  Anyway, this book is in my top ten essential security  reading list.  Thank you Eric!	2000-06-15
US	49796397	R2ZKO4IMHR6RSB	0789722836	897705672	The Multi-Boot Configuration Handbook	Books	4	21	22	N	N	Sets the standard and merits space on your book shelf!	I eagerly anticipated the release of this book after Rod mentioned it on Usenet news.  I was not disappointed, but I hope the following needs will be addressed in the 2d edition (which would get 5 stars).  I loved seeing Windows NT/2000, Linux, FreeBSD, and BeOS covered, but I missed Solaris  x86, the last of the &quot;Big Five&quot; OS' (in my opinion).  I needed  more information on exactly how to place certain boot-related files below  the 1024th cylinder, and which files those might be.  Actual examples,  maybe from Rod's own multi-OS machine, of working directory layouts (on the  CD, perhaps) would have helped.  (To me, this is the most frustrating and  potentially crippling aspect of multi-booting.)  Also, coverage of  multi-booting on laptops is needed.  Many business professionals require  such features when doing demos or other work.  On the positive side, the  book is unique, offering unparalleled attention to detail (defining every  important term and acronym).  Multi-booting is thoroughly covered, with  lots of detail given to partitions, OS boot requirements, and related info.  I learned a lot more than multi-OS operations, thanks to Rod's extensive  knowledge of computing in general.  I highly recommend this book and would  love to see a newsgroup... Thanks Rod!	2000-06-01

I work in the intrusion detection field, and I approached this book as a definitive and highly-respected guide to internetworking.  &quot;Interconnections&quot; contained more than I bargained for.  If  you're looking for a reference work that extends well beyond IP, and  collects information for comparison and posterity's sake, this tome is for  you.  If you're looking for more of an introductory to intermediate text,  with more of an IP focus, either look elsewhere or scour this book for what  you need.  I did find it highly refreshing to read the words of a true  master of the networking profession, and her candid evaluations of  protocols, committee decisions, and failures of common sense.  I was  especially pleased to absorb the clarity of her opinions on layer 2 vs  layer 3 switching, and all the vendor/committee mislabelling that follows!  (Is it a bridge, router, etc.?)  Enjoy!	2000-05-29
US	49796397	R1QGLSYCK38L3Z	0735708681	9385662	Network Intrusion Detection: An Analysts' Handbook	Books	5	38	38	N	N	Northcutt hits the ball out of the park!	I am the chief of a 15 person intrusion detection team, with responsibility for centralized, around-the-clock monitoring of a global network.  I believe I have enough experience to claim Steven's book is first rate and sorely needed.  His reconstruction of a Christmas Eve system compromise and his analysis of Kevin Mitnick's TCP hijack of Tsutomu Shimomura's host are excellent case studies. His coverage of reset scans and other non-standard reconnaissance techniques prompted me to scour my traffic for the same events and write a paper on my findings. I do not agree with some of his conclusions on SYN ACK and reset scans, but his work made me investigate those topics. While I would have preferred slightly more explanation and examples of network traces (who wouldn't?), I hope this book begins a trend of sharing (sanitized) packet-level incident details within the IDS community.  I recommended Steven's book to every analyst on my flight and every person in my unit, and I plan to build in-house training around it.  I guarantee every person with a technical leaning and a position on the front line of intrusion detection will appreciate Steven's book.  See you at SANS Network Security 99	1999-08-26

Don't let the 1991 publication date fool you.  Aside from some out-of-date tax information in a later chapter, this book packs an amazing amount of useful financial clues and explanations. One of the strongest features of this text is its use of examples.  Whether it's options, futures, or IPOs, the authors provide number-based scenarios to guide the reader towards understanding.  This book will not excite you or show how to make $2 million in the stock market.  It will help you understand many of the financial instruments which comprise capitalism.	1998-08-02
