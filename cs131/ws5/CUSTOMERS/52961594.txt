A series of people come along to make common, patent suggestions for how to fix the horse problem, including using a bigger whip, letting a more experienced rider give it a try, team-riding and two of my favorites, \\"how about an Individualized Equestrian Plan (IEP)?\\" and a clown on stilts who suggests that they \\"raise the standard on dead-horse riding.\\"<br /><br />After a dozen or so ideas that clearly wont work because they all focus on the dead horse, a little boy comes in and says simply that if you're riding a dead horse, you need to get off (the teacher is seen in a red convertible merrily zooming away on the last page).<br /><br />\\"If You're Riding a Horse and It Dies...\\" looks like a children's book but clearly has an adult message.  It's cute and will no doubt ring true to anyone who's been a classroom teacher for more than, say, 3 days.  It's biggest failing, noted by many other reviewers, is that is does nothing but illustrate and put between 2 covers the most common suggestions to improve dead horse riding, none of which have worked in any meaningful, widespread way.<br /><br />Teachers are like soldiers in the army:  we are the ones who do much/all of the gruntwork and we are also most powerless in the entire hierarchy.  We can do very little in and of ourselves BY ourselves to affect sweeping change.  We know that we're often riding a dead horse, and if anyone would LISTEN to us and take our suggestions seriously, we very well COULD get off the horse and into the lil' red sportscar.<br /><br />The book makes no suggestions for how to affect change from within, but in fairness, I don't think that's the book's purpose.  The book is intended, I think, to be more of an amusement and call to arms than a step-by-step instruction manual for revamping education and eliminating dead horses.  Those who are interested in such a thing might do well to check out \\"The Comfort Trap (or, What if You're Riding a Dead Horse)\\" by Judith Sills.<br /><br />I can't justify giving it 5 stars or even really 4 because, IMHO, a book of this sort should offer at least a small, bulleted list of Where To Begin And How To Fix Education.  Still, I think it would have some use for beginning Leadership and other Team meetings where those gathered could use it as an amusing way of beginning to discuss how the dead horses of the school can be taken away for a safe burial.om within, but in fairness, I don't think that's the book's purpose.

That's because we don't have a home and the airport is better than the streets.  We are careful not to get caught.\\"<br /><br />So begins Ms. Bunting's 1991 story, \\"Fy Away Home\\" about a homeless child and his father who live in an airport, spending their days trying to blend in and stay under the radar of local security.<br /><br />Told from the child's persepective, FAH is not an easy book to read, even (and perhaps especially) for adults.  Andrew, the narrator, frankly discusses how he and his dad avoid detection by wearing blue, changing terminals, keeping clean in the bathrooms and sleeping sitting up.  A number of their fellow homeless friends have been discovered and tossed out, usually for loud or unusual behavior.  It's terribly important to Andrew and his dad that they be as invisable as possible.<br /><br />Andrew tells how his dad takes the bus on weekends to a job where he's a janitor and how the Medinas, another homeless family, watch over Andrew on those days.  Dad fishes newspapers out of the trash and makes phone calls, presumably about renting an apartment, but always returns disappointed.<br /><br />The crux of the book comes when Andrew discovers a bird trapped inside the airport.  He keeps an eye on it until one day the sliding glass doors open for just a second and whoosh! the bird flies away to freedom.  This becomes a sort of metaphor for Andrew as he stands at the window, watching the planes take off at the end; an end in which we don't know what will become of Andrew of his dad.<br /><br />\\"Fly Away Home\\" was clearly written before the security crackdown after 9/11, but the message will still ring true to post-9/11 readers.  There's a sadness and frustration that runs through the book, and a low level of fear of discovery:  it's obvious that if Andrew and his dad are discovered, they'll be turned out and who knows what will happen next.  Still, there's a feeling of hope to the book and the certainty that, as humans, we can adapt to anything; \\"it's nice right here, though, isn't it, Andrew?  it's warm.  It's safe.  And the price is right.\\"<br /><br />Though a picture book, very young readers most likely wont get much out of the book or else they may become fearful that they too will become homeless and need to live in an airport or other public building.  I've read this book to my 3rd graders and most of them grasped the seriousness of the text, though some were frustrated at the ambiguity of the ending.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for school-aged kids and upper grades as a way of communicating a difficult concept-- homelessness-- to children in a truthful but not terrifying or horrific way.  Excellent work, Ms. Bunting, as usual!!inty that, as humans, we can adapt to anything; \\"it's nice right here, though, isn't it, Andrew?  it's warm.  It's safe.

In Ms. Prose's novel, \\"After\\", a school shooting @ a high school some 30 miles away prompts Central High to hire on a grief & crisis counselor who, basically, takes over the school. Students are suspended for the most minor infractions of rules, and teachers are acting mysterious and paranoid.  Indeed, the book is LOADED with paranoia to the point that it borders on ridiculous-- a student apparently disappears and then is perhaps murdered because of a red AIDS awareness ribbon (the color red is banned from the school)? C'mon, even the most jaundiced teen readers are likely to groan inwardly and set this work down, and should they come to the end of the book, the ending will certainly make everyone wonder \\"what the heck happened?\\"<br /><br />The book stands as a good example what happens when peoples rights are taken away by those in power under the blanket statement of \\"we're doing this for your own good\\", but the author went waaay too far w/this book. It would have been much better and more realistic if only a FEW rights were stamped on vs. the they're-coming-to-get-us-all! sort of over-the-top plot that we see here. Besides, ANY student in ANY urban district would scoff at the idea of being suspended for 2+ days for wearing a red AIDS ribbon (schools RARELY suspend ANYONE these days because the need their attendance numbers to be high and not to appear, statistically, to have a discipline problem), and in a suburban district, the students would march on the school w/their parents, their lawyers and the local chapter of the ACLU. THAT would have been more believable.<br /><br />Finally, shame shame shame on the publishers for putting this book into an edition where the text is padded out for extra length! The margins are wide and the text is double-spaced, so the book weighs in at 330 pages-- far longer than it'd be if published w/less padding-- so even my reluctant readers in class who said they'd like to read the book were immediately turned off by the length. It's got promise, but in a world of rampant paranoia, this is waaaay too far out there to take seriously.<br /><br />MIND, I said `to take seriously'.  If you're looking for a book that caters to your sense of paranoia and is a quick read and will get you to cast a jaundiced eye at people in power, then you might want to check out \\"After.\\"h.

In their successful 1999 publication, \\"The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook\\", the authors Piven & Borgenicht gave us useful advice for surviving everything from a shark attack, to how to take a punch in the face with the minimum of injury.  Now, as we swiftly approach the holiday season, they give us their latest work which focuses on holiday survival.<br />While you won't find information on how to safely jump out of a 2 story window into a trash dumpster, you WILL find information on how to gain control of a one-horse open sleigh, how to defend yourself against a charging reindeer and how to extricate yourself or someone else who is stranded in a chimney.<br />For the \\"rest of us\\" who aren't likely to find ourselves descending chimneys or dodging rutting male reindeer, there are LOTS of very helpful bits of advice for those things you're very LIKELY to encounter during this holiday season, including How To Wear Tight-Fitting Clothing that you've \\"outgrown\\" due to holiday eating, how to guess at what's inside a present (and how to PREVENT people who snoop on their presents!), as well as how to avoid kisses under the mistletoe and how to prevent yourself from being swept away by a marauding crowd of holiday shoppers.<br />Some survival tips are pure fun, like How To Repurpose A Fruitcake (doorstop, object d'art and tire block for your car are just a few), while others may actually be quite helpful in an actual situation:  How To Prevent A Turkey From Exploding; How To Extinguish A Burning Turkey; and How To Treat Mistletoe (and food) Poisoning In Both People And Pets (you DID know that the berries of mistletoe are poisonous, didn't you?)<br />Naturally, this book is heavier on how to act in social settings (like dealing with meddlesome relatives and annoying carolers) and entertaining guests (how to open a bottle of wine with a broken cork, how to make an emergency menorah) than it is on actual dangers, but for anyone who's looking for a fun read and some practical advice, this and the other Worst-Case books are definitely worth getting!  With it's festive, reflective silver cover, it's a perfect gift for the holidays as well as displaying prominently among your holiday displays.  Besides, you just never know when disaster might strike, and you should always Be Prepared!!  Highly recommended!ctical advice, this and the other Worst-Case books are definitely worth getting!

As it so happens, the orphans are out of the frying pan into the fire in this new book, a phrase that herein means, \\"have gone from one bad situation where Violet was barely saved from certain unnecessary surgery, into a possible worse one by hiding in the trunk of the Count's car.\\"<br />The count, as it turns out, is barreling off with his troope of odd characters to the tent of Madame Lulu the fortune teller, who lives far out in the Hinterlands.  Like other books in this Unfortunate Series, the orphans continue to be in mortal peril (a phrase that herein means \\"dreadful danger\\") as they avoid the clutches of Count Olaf.  Managing to disguise themselves as carnival freaks, they take up residence in Madame Lulu's freak show aside a humpback, a contortionist and a very glum ambidexterous fellow who can use either hands equally well.<br />Madame Lulu, who may not be all that she appears to be, has mysteriously always provided the Count with information about the Baudelaire trio, which finally explains how exactly he always knows where they are and how to find them.  She drops hints that one of the orphan's parents may have survived the fire that apparently killed them back in book #1 (The Bad Beginning), and she gets oh-so-close to explaining the true meaning of VFD, and readers of the series and of Mr. Snicket's unauthorized biography are lead tantalizingly close to the answers for which they've sought about VFD and why Count Olaf, Jaques Snicket and Madame Lulu have tattoos or insignia of an eye on or about them.  Pieces of the puzzle are just beginning to fit together, but not...quite...<br />This is, of course, the ninth book in the series, and Mr. Snicket gives us some hints, as he always does, at the end of the story to the next book in the series, which I assume will be called \\"The Slippery Slope.\\"  Readers who have read up to this point will be delighted and enthralled by the mysteries that peek out here and there throughout the book, like prarie dogs peeking out of their burrows before quickly disappearing again.  If you have not yet read books 1-8 in the series, it is recommended that you do so before attacking \\"Carnivorous Carnival\\", as much of what happens in this story won't make sense if you've not been following the sad lives of the Baudelaire orphans since the beginning.

A car that only LOOKS like a car and the memories of what happened to the troopers of Pennsylvania State Trooper D squad is the subject of King's latest (and, perhaps, his last) book.<br />Told mainly in flashback, \\"From a Buick 8\\" concerns a very odd classic Roadmaster Buick that rolls into a gas station one day with a mysterious driver behind the wheel.  Pale skin, with an almost melted-looking face, the driver heads off around the station presumably to the bathroom, and disappears.  With the driver suddenly missing, the Staties are called in to have a look-see at the vehicle.  Things immediately get very strange:  there are no prints in or on the car, the car itself has no dirt, dust or pollens in or ON it (the tires won't even hold a pebble jammed down between the treads), and the engine is designed in such a way that there's no way it could ever move an inch under it's own power.  It only LOOKS like a car, then, and it's enough to give anyone on Troop D the creeps.<br />The car is stored in a shed out back of the troop's barracks, where a young Ned Wilcox discovers it.  Ned is the son of a State D trooper who was recently killed in a pointless and horrific traffic accident.  Ned's been hanging around the barracks a lot since his dad died, trying to get a better feel for what his father was like on the job, when he discovers the car under a shed.  He also notes that while the temperature outside of the shed is in the 80's, INSIDE the shed it's hovering in the low 60's.  What's going on here?  Why is the car there?  Whats up with the temperature change?<br />The stories start then, mostly told by Sandy, the current Troop D commanding officer, and the book begins to shuttle between the present day and the days when the car was first found, and then started doing mysterious and horrific things.  Strange, twisted, potentially dangerous and hideous THINGS begin to come OUT of the car during periods when the car releases blasts of intense light.  Turns out Ned's dad was the resident Buick Expert (in as much as anyone COULD be an expert of such a bizarre thing) and spent a huge deal of time trying to figure what the Buick really WAS and where it came from.  Ned, like his late father, becomes totally fascinated in the Buick, and begins to wonder if somehow the car managed to murder his father...<br />I am what Mr. King refers to as a Constant Reader-a fan of his writing, in other words.  Having read almost all of the works of King, I can say that \\"Buick 8\\" departs from King's tradition of grab-you-by-the-throat style of horror.  This work is more reminiscent of his epic work \\"It\\", where a good deal of the action has already happened, and the reader is just there to hear the story and be enveloped in a good tale.  There is a strong sense of nostalgia to this tale, and the plot easily unwinds and you're there, right in the thick of things, trying to figure out just what this devil-car IS, and where it came from.  In the end, we wind up being as bewildered as the original cast of troopers who kept vigil over this strange thing from the beginning.<br />There is an audio version of this book that is unique in that there are 5 narrators reading the story.  The characters that are telling the story to Ned right now are all voiced by different actors while the parts that happen in the past (\\"Then\\", in the book) is voiced by one single actor.  I am a diehard fan of audio books and have very high standards for narrators, ESPECIALLY for long audio books like this one which weigh in at 13.5 hours on 12 CD's:  unless I am completely engrossed at all times, I don't bother listening to the book.<br />This audio version is stunning and highly recommended.  Each narrator takes their time, doesn't rush through the material, and unspools the story as if you're sitting there with them, outside Troop B barracks, hearing all the odd and terrifying tales about the strange Buick for the first time.  Kudos to the publisher for allowing the voice actors totake their time and not rushing them to the finish line.  Overall, highly recommended, especially in audio format.to take their time and not rushing them to the finish line.  Overall, highly recommended, especially in audio format.	2002-10-26

Books	5	29	31	N	N	Excellent examination of major, unspoken problems	Anyone with children will realize that the Golden Age of Education is over.  Gone are the halcyon days of elementary school where children were first taught how to be good human beings and live in a civilization, and academics came second.  Now, with high-stakes testing and the punitive \\"No Child Left Behind\\" initive by the Bush administration (which is more accurately called \\"No Child Left Untested\\" by the author), testing has become paramount to just about anything else teachers do or have done in decades past.<br />Case in point:  a school district in Michigan has a 539-page curriculum for PRESCHOOL.  Student's ranking in schools and teacher's salaries are directly linked to one or two tests that students take that focus on exclusive and often inappropriate material.  Children in elementary schools throughout America are taking tests for days on end, racking up more test-taking hours than potential lawyers taking the Bar Exam.  Wild animals used in Hollywood films have more break times in their days than your average schoolchild.  Kindergarten curriculum, in the words of many people who run education, should be preparing children for college.  In other words, as a nation, we have completely lost our marbles when it comes to testing and too many governmental folk are bowing down at the altar of test-worship.<br />A local educator recently said, \\"if I need to know how Little Johnny is doing in school, I go to HIM, not to his Ohio Proficiency Test from 1999.\\"  This clear and obvious paradigm for finding out how a child is doing in school has been completely left behind in recent years, and is likely to keep on happening.  Ms. Ohanian's book is frighteningly FULL of examples and incidents when educators have gone straight to some standardized test to see how children are performing in school vs. the children themselves.  Where the teachers stand in all these goings on is somewhere between a soldier on the front lines being given totally ridiculous and dangerous commands, and a prisoner of war being forced to do whatever the Big Wigs say, or else they're likely to find themselves up against a firing squad (for example, a school in Chicago SUED a teacher for 3 MILLION DOLLARS for looking at a standardized test before administering it to the children.  A teacher will go to JAIL if they even GLANCE over a child's shoulder during standardized tests in Florida).<br />Ms. Ohanian asks some very good questions throughout her book, including why aren't teachers and parents DOING something about this national craze for test scores, and how is this REALLY HELPING any child to be tested to the point of getting sick and vomiting?  She also asks some quite valid questions, like why are we spending billions of dollars testing children when so many schools are literally falling apart?  Instead of shelling out 3 million dollars to a test-writing company, why not spend that money on repairing the SCHOOL? What do we hope to accomplish by testing children into the ground?  What message are we sending our teachers and our children when their teacher is not only NOT allowed to even LOOK at the test, but risks jail time if they do? (can't you just see THAT one:  HARDENED CRIMINAL:  \\"whatcha in for, buddy?  Murder 1?\\"  TEACHER: \\"no, I looked over the shoulder of a first grader during a standardized test...\\").<br />The message is pretty clear:  children don't matter at all unless they fall within a certain range on one or two standardized tests that are usually given once, graded by someone who is NOT an educator, and the results are posted months later (in Cleveland, our proficiency tests were taken back in March, but we're just getting the results of those tests NOW, 7 months later).  It's also clear that teachers and parents are clearly not experts on their own children, because the LAST person to be consulted about how Johnny does in school are these very people:  those who write the laws and the curriculum and who punish the schools and teachers are only looking at pages of statistics.<br />Gaaah...  Maddening...<br />Ms. Ohanian's book is meticulously well researched and she cites startling and often frightening statistics and stories about what is considered \\"normal\\" educational proceedings in America today.  I myself am rereading it for the second time, taking notes as I go and passing it along to my teaching colleagues.  Actually, it's getting to the point where EVERY SINGLE PAGE documents something either useful, scary or enraging that I'm finding it easier to simply hand the book to friends and colleagues and say, \\"here, read this.\\"<br />My hope is that this book and others like it will actually DO SOMETHING-spark off a national debate and get parents and teachers and students to go out there and stop putting up with this nonsense.  There's no reason children in North Carolina have to be tested on the spelling and meaning of \\"circumference\\" in first grade.  Nothing good will come of testing our children so often that they loose the ability to THINK and can only regurgitate information and bubble in little circles with a no. 2 pencil.  PARENTS know that.  TEACHERS know that.  FAMILIES know that.  ANYONE who works with a child knows that.  NOW we need to make sure that our lawmakers (who obviously all live in a totally different world from us Common Folk) begin to know that as well.  Get the book, read it through, then pass it along to someone else.  If the people lead, eventually the leaders will follow.s are only looking at pages of statistics.<br />Gaaah...

Skeleton wakes up one morning (the headboard of his bed is a gravestone with RIP engraved on it) and discovers that he's got a bad case of the hiccups.  He starts his day off, but the hiccups aren't making things easy for him.  In the shower, he looses the soap.  Brushing his teeth, his jaw flies off!  Polishing his bones, the hiccups cause his arm to come undone!  Carving a pumpkin and raking leaves aren't easy, either, with these bone-rattling hiccups!<br />When Skeleton goes outside to play ball with Ghost, the old remedies for curing hiccups are suggested.  Skeleton eats some sugar (which falls through his jawbone and over his ribs), he drinks a glass of water standing on his head (he water gushes out of his eye sockets), and Ghost tries to scare him.  Well, nothing works until Ghost gets a sneaky idea involving a mirror...<br />The team of Cuyler and Schindler have combined to produce a wonderful and funny book in \\"Skeleton Hiccups.\\"  The illustrations are big and bold with vibrant colors that delight the eye.  Skeleton is beautifully drawn with enough detail to see his individual bones but not so much detail that he'd be scary to young children.  Ghost, too, is a character, sporting a blue baseball cap he wears backwards and a pug nose.  The pages are large and uncluttered and easy to read.<br />The text of \\"Skeleton Hiccups\\" is brief and simple, with small-font \\"hic! Hic! Hic!\\"s bouncing on each page as skeleton tries to go about his business with these pesky hiccups.  When I read this book to a class of preschoolers, they really liked the hic-hic-hic part, and would repeat it every time they saw it on the page.  Children who were normally a bit skittish around Halloween skeletons thought that this one was pretty funny, especially because he had troubles that they themselves have had!<br />\\"Skeleton Hiccups\\" is perfect for Halloween time, of course, but there's no reason why it should only be read during October.  I showed the book to the art teacher at our school who immediately fell in love with it-\\"it's sooo hard for kids to draw skeletons!\\" she said, \\"they require so much detail.  But THIS Skeleton is just perfect!\\"  She went on to say that she intends to use this book and another one called \\"Hobgoblin and the Skeleton\\" to teach about human anatomy and proportion in her art classes.<br />For anyone who likes Halloween or a good laugh, for those of us who have a fascination with the human skeleton, this book comes highly recommended!!school who immediately fell in love with it-\\"it's sooo hard for kids to draw skeletons!\\" she said, \\"they require so much detail.

US	52961594	RASVHZ9RISCVQ	0375410678	929553285	If Not, Winter: Fragments of Sappho (English and Greek Edition)	Books	5	73	80	N	N	Beautiful new translation of an ancient favorite	There is precious little known about the ancient Greek Poet, Sappho.  Most of us know the obvious, that she was a famous poet and lyricist (meaning, she composed music to be sung with the lyre) and that she lived on the island of Lesbos off the Greek coast in about 630 B.C..  However, almost all other details about her life, such as they are, come from texts written about her by other ancient writers; of the 9 books of lyrics she is reported to have written, none survive today.<br />Fragments of poetry written by Sappho still exist, but most are damaged or illegible.  Hence, here as in other previous works of the poetry of Sappho, the reader is left with only fragments of what clearly must have been delicate and breathtakingly beautiful poetry.  As Ms. Carson says in her introduction to her translations, the reader is left with a profound sense of wonder when confronted with the small snippets of Sappho's poetry.  For example, all that survives of poem 36 is \\"I long and seek after\\".  What, we wonder, does the rest of the poem pertain to?  What flowing scenes did she paint with her words that we can never know?<br />I personally am not a Classicist, though I HAVE read through many of the surviving texts of the ancient worlds:  Beowulf &amp; The Odyssey, for example, and occasionally I'll attack some texts in Latin and have a go at the translation.  However, for the most part, I am not a scholar of ancient times or texts.  I'm here to say that one does NOT, even for a second, need to know much about ancient Greek culture, text or times to thoroughly enjoy these translations.  Granted, you will find that most poems are little more than bits of a whole (sometimes only a word or two survives), but even these small pieces will cause your imagination to soar.<br />Ms. Carson has also boldly gone where no translator has gone before (to my knowledge).  In previous translations of Sappho's poetry that I've read, the pages are crammed tight with the fragments themselves, explanations and footnotes.  In Ms. Carson's book, each page is dedicated to one fragment of Sappho's poetry, regardless of it's length.  In this respect, a poem that is only three words long has an entire page dedicated to itself.  This is a wonderful touch, as it means that the reader's entire attention can be focused only on that poem, no matter how small, without the distraction of commentary by the author (Ms. Carson puts an extensive appendix at the back where she adds her thoughts and comments on the fragment's origin, word meaning and characters).  Opposite the English translations are the original fragments in their original Greek characters.  I myself cannot read Greek, but I found it a beautiful and thought-provoking touch to be able to look at what Sappho wrote in her own language.  Though I'm not able to read Greek, it made the text more alive to have it there for me to look at and examine.<br />In conclusion, anyone who enjoys ancient Greek culture, ancient history or simply enjoys reading poetry should not hesitate to add this book to their collection.  I'd personally go so far as to say that if you've got a different volume of Sappho's poetry, make some shelf space to add THIS book as well.  For the clean, uncluttered page and lyrical, moving translation, I highly recommend this work and highly compliment Ms. Carson on her work.nations and footnotes.

US	52961594	R39UCT17XLJ7UI	0688114415	169942962	Mama, Coming and Going	Books	5	0	0	N	N	a must read for older sibs!!	When Jenna's little brother was born, funny things started happening to her mother.  Mama remembered some things, but forgot a lot of others!  For example, she remembered to read to Jenna, but she forgot to defrost the chicken for dinner (\\"so they had pizza instead.\\").  When Mama draws water for Jenna's bath, she forgets about the water when the doorbell rings and Jenna's little brother brother, Mickey, spits up.  Mama also remembers to get groceries, but forgets to close the trunk and one time even accidently locks Mickey in the car! (a friendly neighbor comes to the rescue with a coat hanger).<br />For any older sibling who has a newborn addition to the family, things like this are common even among the most organized parents. What can be confusing to the older sib is what exactly is going on?  Why is Mama suddenly getting forgetful?  While the book doesn't exactly answer this question, it does tell us that everything will work out in the end and Mamas are good at improvising (when Jenna, Mickey and her Mama go to a birthday party a week early, Mama looks ready to cry but instead they go by a bakery and have a cupcake instead).<br />I love this story, especially now that our second child has entered our lives and our older child is wondering why the adults are not only always tired, but why we do things like stick the cereal in the refrigerator and the milk in the cupboard, and why I've gone to work in mismatched socks on more than one occasion.  As families, somehow we manage to muddle through all the little trials and tribulations and try to make the best of even the most frustrating situations (when the bathroom floor floods, \\"Jenna went wading in her rainboots.\\").<br />The text of \\"Mama...\\" is easy to read and understand, so young children with new sibs can easily understand these funny situations.  The illustrations are soft and colorful (watercolors, I think), and they clearly convey a sense of belonging and family among the characters, even when minor disasters strike like flooded floors, open car trunks and too-early arrivals to birthday parties.  The book also shows us that minor setbacks and frustrations are simply a part of being in a family, and instead of complaining about it, what can we do to make the situation better? (Jenna entertains Mickey in the back seat while Mr. Carbone jimmies the door lock).<br />For the delightful illustrations, for the ease of text and for demonstrating that everyday frustrations are part of life, I highly recommend this book to parents and families of all kinds!asters strike like flooded floors, open car trunks and too-early arrivals to birthday parties.

US	52961594	R2M5LGNABEMKRE	0375801561	419839632	The Last Alchemist	Books	5	8	8	N	N	delightfully bizarre story!!	In a kingdom far, far away, in the deep and dark cellars and dungeons of a King's castle, alchemists have been toiling away for centuries to find the secret for turning metals (or anything else) into gold.  For centuries, they've failed at this attempt, though in Mr. Thompson's book, \\"The Last Alchemist\\", we meet the pop-eyed, withered and completely stressed out Spinifex.  Spinifex is the 19th alchemist for the kingdom, and the greedy king has given him until the end of the year to find, FINALLY, the secret for turning metals into gold.<br />Spinifex sets off on this quest with a passion, doing research in the vast (and completely bizarre) library, cooking up everything he possibly can think of to make gold, all the while bossing around his small apprentice, Arthur.  For his own part, Arthur is far more interested in things like sunflowers than smelly potions, and as the story goes on, the reader gets the distinct impression that as Spinifex's experiments build and build up to a gigantic machine, something downright catastrophic is going to happen before the story is over!<br />The plot and text of \\"The Last Alchemist\\" is fun and easy to read, but what will REALLY hook readers are the illustrations.  Brightly colored with many shades of almost fluorescent pink, blue, orange and red, the book is a veritable treat for the eyes.  On each page fantastically odd things are happening that almost defy explanation.  The castle's library, for example, is right out of M.C. Escher's world, with staircases going upside down, sideways, and off into impossible directions.  Walking all over these stairs, reading books, hiding in crannies or peeking out of cracks are hooded figures, strange creatures and beady lil' eyes.  Doors are on walls which are really floors for other stairs, and many of the books themselves are odd, winged creatures.  Teeny little creatures crawl through and around Spinifex's laboratory equipment, bringing the wrinkled and gray Spinifex the strange ingredients for his experiments.<br />It's hard to think of a close equivalent in illustration style that really gives an accurate picture.  The crowded pages of \\"Where's Waldo?\\" comes to mind, but Mr. Thompson's illustrations are far more bizarre than anything Waldo had seen.  There's a slightly macabre feeling to these pictures, and if I was hard pressed I'd have to say it resembles the album cover of Elton John's 1975 \\"Captain Fantastic & the Brown Dirt Cowboy\\".  There's a certain Monty Python-esque feeling to the illustrations.<br />I personally LOVE this book, as do both of my children and the students I've shown this to at school.  Some kids said that very young children might find it \\"really weird\\" because of all the little creatures crawling over the pages or the inanimate objects (books, flasks, lamps, etc) that have legs or eyes.

The world lost a close, personal friend when Mr. Schulz passed away.  Fortunately for those of us who are fans of his work, fine books like this remain as a tribute and history of his work.<br />In \\"Peanuts:  The Art of Charles M. Schulz\\", readers are given a short biography of Mr. Schulz and now he found himself falling into the role of an artist (turns out he first started seriously drawing in the army!).  Over time, he began drawing a strip called \\"Lil' Folk\\" that bears strong resemblance to the modern Peanuts gang.  The thing that set Lil' Folk aside from other strips at the time was that the children Schulz drew were not only funny and stylized (a kid with a particularly round head who would later evolve into Charlie Brown caught the heart of readers), but because the kids themselves would say precocious things beyond their years.<br />In this collection, a very large section is devoted to Lil' Folks and the very early Peanuts cartoons.  You can easily see how certain characters began and how they evolved into the characters we've seen over the years in Christmas specials, advertising for Met Life and Millbrook bread, and waiting for the Great Pumpkin.  The book itself is about 90% comic strips arranged on the page in order of their publication, so comic strip fans can take in a whole month's worth of strips in a few pages.<br />The work is exhaustive of Schulz's early works and hundreds of strips that have never been released in any other anthology/collection of Schulz's work are found here.  The only drawback is that the book itself is narrow, so many of the strips come out being rather small-smaller than they'd normally look in a newspaper.  While you don't need to read the book with a magnifying glass, you may find yourself squinting at certain older strips that haven't survived the test of time or that came off the printer slightly fuzzy.  Frankly, I think the publisher should have insisted on a larger, coffee table-sized book where the strips could be seen more easily.<br />Still, for anyone who is a fan of Peanuts, this is a MUST HAVE!  For the biography and early sketchbook illustrations by Mr. S., for it's heretofore unpublished strips, and as a testimony to a kind, brilliant and dedicated illustrator, this book comes highly recommended by this Peanuts aficionado.n more easily.<br />Still, for anyone who is a fan of Peanuts, this is a MUST HAVE!

Most kids are, of course, totally fascinated by things that are slimy, squishy, walk on many hairy legs or potentially dangerous.  Most kids will sit and play with caterpillars, pillbugs, frogs, toads and the like.  Given the chance, most kids will even be interested in examining dead animals, like road kill, to see what's inside and what made `em tick.  It's no surprise, then, that a good many kids would be TOTALLY fascinated with \\"Youch!  It Bites!\\" and it's collection of strange-looking and potentially dangerous animals, plants and insects.<br />Taking a tour of some of the more well-known (and usually deadly) insects, plants and animals, the authors provide the reader with close-up pictures of things like black widow spiders, jellyfish, poison ivy, mosquitoes and the like.  Each page has a large illustration and a lift-the-flap section that gives more detail (more GORY detail, perhaps) about the thing being discussed.  Comparisons and contrasts are discussed, for example the fact that a giant, hairy tarantula isn't dangerous to humans but a teeny-tiny black widow is.  Little known details and electron microscope scans are on practically every page for that extreme-close-up view of things you normally miss-- like the sharp end of a mosquito's needle-like (and hairy!) proboscis and the stinging fang of a spider.<br />Potential readers-- ESPECIALLY young readers-- should be aware that this book is not for the squeamish or the easily frightened!  For example, both a snake and a TOAD are seen eating mice that they have killed.  While this is perfectly normal for the animal and what it does to survive, the large picture of a toad with a mouse in it's mouth is somehow horrifying-- you don't think of toads going after something that big.  A close-up of a row of piranha teeth, pointy and needle-sharp, might make an impressionable or sensitive child think twice about going in the water, even though these fish aren't found in North America.<br />In short, as a parent and teacher, there are kids who will really get into this book, and kids who will get nightmares from this book.  Young children, who can't understand that they won't get stung by jellyfish or eaten by piranha in the local poor or lake, shouldn't read this book.  Also, care should be taken when reading this book to young children, as it's text is rather sensational and full of references to fangs \\"dripping with venom\\" and spiders that \\"can kill a person.\\"  When *I* was a kid, something like this would have had me cringing in bed all day long!<br />The book is very good and the illustrations are excellent, no doubt about that.  I'm not sure that the tabloid-headline style of the text is a good choice-- implying that kids can die horrible deaths by being bitten by a teeny spider or eaten alive by sharp-toothed fish is a bit over the top for my taste, but then again, I was always sensitive as a child.<br />Think carefully of who you're buying this book for, and enjoy the wild and dangerous world of poisonous animals, plants and insects!teacher, there are kids who will really get into this book, and kids who will get nightmares from this book.

Lemony Snicket, the author of the popular \\"Series of Unfortunate Events\\" and chronicler of the ill-fated Baudelaire triplets has been faithfully relaying the stories of Klaus, Sunny and Violet B. now has a biography that will undoubtedly ask more questions than it answers.<br />Mr. Snicket, who's 8 books of the orphans include \\"The Bad Beginning,\\" \\"The Reptile Room\\" all the way up to \\"The Hostile Hospital\\" and \\"The Carnivorous Carnival\\" due out in the Fall of 2002, has relayed the stories of how the evil Count Olaf has followed the triplets through a series of misadventures in the hopes of stealing their fortunes and doing away with the children themselves.  Surrounded by unhelpful and often idiotic adults, like Mr. Poe who is in charge of finding them guardians (all of whom turn out to be recklessly abusive, paranoid or both), we last saw the triplets stashed in the trunk of a car trying to find not only the meaning and mystery of V.F.D., but the missing two Quagmire triplets who were last seen floating away in a Self-Sustaining Hot Air Mobile Home.<br />The Unauthorized Biography of Lemony Snicket is SUPPOSED to shed some light on some very pressing questions readers of the series will have, chief among them is What is VFD? and Why Does Count Olaf Have a Tattoo of an Eye on His Ankle?  Though these and 11 other questions appear in the books table of contents, the text itself has been tremendously altered by some reader--we assume Mr. Snicket himself--and the questions as well as answers have been wholly changed.<br />The book itself is painstakingly illustrated with photographs, letters, correspondences (many of which are crumpled, torn or burned in the attempt to keep them out of dangerous hands), and there are a lot of HINTS as to what VFD is, why Count Olaf has a tattoo, and who some of the minor characters like Jacques Snicket really are, but readers won't find any open, honest and concrete answers here.<br />The book calls itself dangerous, and therefore has a reversible cover so you can disguise this work as a fake book called \\"The Luckiest Kids in the World!  Book 1!  The Pony Party!\\" by a certain Loney M. Setnick...  The characters on the fake cover somewhat resemble Klaus, Sunny and Violet, so those who are IN THE KNOW about the orphans may read it in public and thereby secretly signal others that they are open to the plight of the orphans and it's pursued author.<br />All asides aside, the book will be very confusing to readers who have not read at least up to book 7 in the series, \\"The Vile Village.\\"  Indeed, it is in book 7 that the plot really begins to twist like one of Uncle Monty's serpents, and a good number of questions raised in #7 are referred to (and more questions raised) in The Unauthorized Biography.  The reversible cover is a fun touch for young readers who will like to play into the conspiracy of Mr. Snicket being a dangerous and hunted character, quietly and secretly churning out the story of the Baudelaire orphans.<br />The book is printed on high-gloss paper with dozens of illustrations and censorship marks, as if the document has been expurgated for the reader's safety, and the photographs and illustrations are quite engrossing.<br />The writing will, as noted, confuse readers who aren't familiar with the gamut of the series, and it might confuse younger readers who aren't exposed to the concepts of conspiracy theory and trying to keep something hidden and suppressed.  Since the writing takes the form of letters, memos, etc, there is no coherent plot to the book, rather a jumble of information that subtly hints at what might be REALLY going on; for example, Jacques Snicket, the authors brother, has a tattoo of an eye on his leg just like Count Olaf.  In a Q & A section re: becoming a volunteer for V.F.D., one of the questions is \\"do I have to get a tattoo?\\"  This implies, to my mind, that Count Olaf himself might have been a member of this still-unexplained secret organization.  Details like this that require a lot of memory and reading between the lines will probably be lost on young readers, leading to frustration.<br />Is the book worth reading?  Yes, if you're a fan of the series, go out and get the book by all means!!  If you're slowly collecting/reading the series, get the book anyway and put it away until you're done with the 7th book at least, preferably the 8th, as The Unauthorized Biography is published between #9 & #10.  If you've never read any books in the series and don't know who Klaus, Sunny, Violet, Jacques, Lemony or Count Olaf are, then don't bother, you'll only waste your money and become helplessly confused.

While the series is now more than 20, but this is where it all starts--with the tourist Twoflower and his bumbling wizard guide, Rincewind.<br />Discworld is unlike any other place a reader may have visited, even in the wild n' wooly world of science fiction and fantasy.  For starters, the entire planet of Discworld is shaped like a LP record (or, for modern readers, a CD or dinner plate):  it's flat and round, encircled by the Circle Sea, which flows forever off the edge of the planet.  Oh, yes, lest we forget, the whole planet is also carried on the back of four enormous elephants which, in turn are balanced on the back of The Great A'Tuan, the World Turtle who swims slowly through the cosmos on errands of it's own.  As an interesting aside, the concept of our Earth being balanced on the back of elephants or turtles is as old as civilization-many creation myths from India had the earth being carried about by these animals.<br />Such an improbable place would, of course by it's very nature, contain a large concentration of magic, wizards, mages, witches, sorcerers and other magical sort of folks.  Our incompetent hero and main character, Rincewind, is himself a wizard, though an exceptionally bad one.  While at wizard school (called Unseen University), he snuck a peek at the Great Book of Spells on a dare, and one of the Great Spells leapt out of the book and into his head.  All other lesser spells, from opening walnuts to changing the weather or your shape, are too scared to stay in the same head as one of the Great Spells, so Rincewind, while technically a wizard, is doomed to wander around doing card tricks for a living.<br />Fortunately, however, Rincewind does have a talent for picking up foreign languages, which allows him to translate for an EXTREMELY RICH tourist who comes to town.  Twoflower the tourist is unique in that A) he has four eyes B) he's the first tourist the town has ever had and C) he's got a strange sort of treasure chest that follows him around on little tiny legs and seems to be able to give him anything-a change of underwear, a flask of water, or more bars of solid gold than the entire town has seen in it's whole history.<br />The fun begins when Rincewind, who is street savvy despite being an inacompetent wizard, tries to first steal Twoflower's treasure and then protect the innocent and naïve Twoflower from the danagers of the city (Twoflower, unaware of how much anything costs, offers up a whole bar of gold for a single glass of water, for example).  Their adventures take them all over the Disc, from the high mountains at the Hub of the world to the edge of the Circle Sea, all the while as the Great Spell tries to get itself spoken by Rincewind, usually when he's just about ready to die some unusual and terrible death (oh, by the way, since only Death himself may take the soul of a wizard, the hooded figure of Death appears quite a lot in this story, usually when Rincewind is about to die some unusual and terrible death).<br />Pratchett loves to poke fun at the whole genre of science fiction and fantasy as well as himself and his own characters.  More than one ridiculous situation will seem oh-so-familiar to those who are much taken with the genre.  The book is worth reading just for the absurd situations that Rincewind and Twoflower find themselves in, as well as the cast of lesser characters who make up the patently motley crew of Discworld.<br />While not specifically a young adult novel, teen readers will no doubt enjoy the fast pace of the novel as well as the ridiculous situations almost every character finds itself in (as well as the ridiculous characters themselves, like Cohen the Barbarian).  Those readers who have read a lot of fantasy/science fiction will enjoy the way that Pratchett pokes fun at the genre itself and the impossible twists in the plot (indeed, in the second book of the series, Rincewind himself falls off the edge of the planet but, no surprise, manages to get back on his feet...)<br />Highly recommended!!  Those who really love this book may want to go onto the second book in the series, \\"The Light Fantastic\\" where the futher adventures of Twoflower and Rincewind are documented.the second book of the series, Rincewind himself falls off the edge of the planet but, no surprise, manages to get back on his feet...)<br />Highly recommended!!

Many of us (perhaps TOO many of us) were required to read at least ONE of the Great Works of Ancient Western Literature, like the Odyssey, the Iliad or (if we were lucky, the shortest one of the lot) Beowulf.  Most of us hated the work because it was really, REALLY long and really, REALLY complicated.  I mean, how many people still read and write in hectambic octameter, or whatever the heck it is...??  Most of us have enough difficulty sloughing through the works of Shakespeare and his sonnets.  So, I think it's fair to say that most of us have been at least EXPOSED to Homer, though we've likely not gotten much out of it.<br />It took a few centuries, but there is finally a translation that brings the story more up-to-date for modern audiences.  The translator, Mr. Fagles, has done away with the rhyming scheme of the original and instead put the text into a more readable format of sentences and paragraphs.  This move alone has made the story more readable than any other translation I've attempted (and it should be noted, even at 13 hours on audio, this is the first translation of Homer I've been able to understand and, more importantly, *finish*).  Expressions of gratitude also go out to him for reducing the amount of \\"thus\\"es and \\"heretofore\\"s and other elements of ancient speech that are commonly found in Greek translations.  While I did notice that he sometimes used very modern words like \\"potluck\\", it is this very modernization that allowed me to more fully get into the text and comprehend it.<br />I therefore disagree with a friend of mine, a Classics professor, who says that Fagles is \\"dumbing down\\" Homer's work by making it more readable (\\"Homer is NOT Stephen King!  It's a story that's over 2,800 years old!!  Of COURSE it's going to be difficult to read!\\", he grumped).  As a writer, storyteller and teacher of English writing and reading, my feelings are that if you have lost your audience, then you might as well be writing to the rocks and trees-the purpose of a story is to be told and UNDERSTOOD;  if the audience doesn't understand you, then what have you got?  Nothing!  So, while I concede that Mr. Fagles might have taken some liberties with the translation and style by making it narrative text vs. poetic -meter, I believe it has only served to enhance the story so much more.<br />Much of the Odyssey, of course, are stories and retellings of the great deeds of the hero, Odysseus, who set forth from his native land of Ithaca to do the sorts of things that heroes do, mostly conquer armies.  Odysseus of course becomes shipwrecked and endures a number of different adventures, including the Island of the Lotus-Eaters, Polyphemus the one-eyed Cyclops, and the destructive singing of the Sirens.  Meanwhile, at home his wife, Penelope, awaits his return while suitors take over the kingdom and try to win her affections, devouring the goods of the realm in the process.<br />For a modern audience with all the convenient of CD-ROM's, the Internet, cable TV and whatnot, the repetitive nature of The Odyssey might grow a bit dull and tiresome if one were to read the whole thing in print, but thanks to the stellar voice talents of Ian McKellen, I breezed through the 12 cassettes in an astoundingly short time, so drawn in was I by his voice.  His soothing tones, rising and falling with the action, pausing here, growing louder there as some battle is raged, is so perfectly matched to the text that you can easily picture him sitting there in some ancient stone hall telling the story as if it were his own and Odysseus his best friend.  I was not bored for an instant with him as my narrator and guide through this ancient story, and I can't recommend this audio version highly enough.<br />In closing, the tapes are packaged with a short but informative and densely written book by Mr. Bernard Knox.  Admittedly, I didn't use or refer to this book often, being more interested in just the story itself than all of the infinite details.<br />An astounding feat of translation, performance and research!!

The main character is an unnamed young boy who is a bit of a loner.  Hes picked on by his classmates for being overweight and his out-of-style wire rimmed glasses.  But, when he plays the violin, his friend Max, who rents out the third floor of the familys home, calls him Professor and always listens and usually sings along with him.<br />Max is a painter, but a quiet and somewhat mysterious one.  He never shows anyone his paintings before they are completely finished, and he later comments that sometimes there are things in his paintings that even HE doesnt see or know about.  The boy loves to sit in a red chair in Maxs room and simply watch him work, even though he doesnt know what Max is working on until hes finished.<br />Max makes frequent trips out of town in which his studio is locked up and the boy has to wait for Maxs return.  When Max returns, he has fantastic stories to tell the boy about the things hes seen, like Canadian Snow Elephants that only appear out of the forest during heavy snowfalls.  They are actually larger than African elephants, but are so very rarely seen because of their white coloring and gentle, quiet ways of walking.  They boy, who narrates the story, is pretty sure that these stories are just fantastic tales of the imagination, but Max tells them so convincingly that there is a part of the boy that comes to believe in the stories somewhat.  When the painter goes on an extended vacation/trip, he leaves all of his paintings out for the boy to look at, as a sort of personal exhibition for one.<br />Heres where the story becomes odd and wonderful:  in each painting there is something odd or unusual is happening, most of which seem to be drawn from Maxs story.  In one painting, Canadian Snow Elephants with their three young calves pass almost invisibly between two houses where the neighbors carry on their daily business, oblivious to the great white beasts.  In another painting, a rail car from a circus floats mysteriously in the air by a bridge in the early evening; a rope ladder is seen hanging from the open front door...<br />The pictures are neither scary nor even spooky so much as they are simply unusual.  I myself could look at them for hours wondering what is going on and what lies just outside the frame of the picture.  If anyone has ever enjoyed looking at the paintings of the French surrealist, Renee Magritte and wondering about his floating castles or falling people, then they will certainly enjoy this book.<br />The text is rather heavy the first half dozen or so pages and there are very few illustrations at first.  When we get to the part of the story where the boy looks at Maxs paintings, they spread across the whole page, a delight and feast for the eye and a teaser for the mind.  But, because of the heaviness of the text, some younger children may not have the stamina to pour through the story to get to the pictures.  The story itself is soft and gentle and really rather quiet and almost nostalgic, so it may not appeal to children who are either very young or looking for big, robust stories where things blow up or the world turns inside out.<br />Still, its an amazing book with a beautifully rendered and translated story that really isnt just for children.  Read it with your child, and I guarantee that youll be pulling it back off the shelf later to read it by yourself!!

Concrete poems are different from other poems, as the editor Mr. Janeczko notes at the beginning of \\"A Poke in the I\\".  In many cases, the poems type font or the way it is laid out on the page determines the poem.  Many of the poems take a specific shape in the way they're laid out on the page.  For example, a beautiful poem called \\"Eskimo Pie\\" is in the shape of that frozen desert, with the words themselves forming the arched top and \\"stick\\".  Some poems rotate around in spirals or take the shape of animals.  Some poems leap around the page and it is the words themselves that show the action of the poem.<br />While many poems could stand alone by themselves, Mr. Raschka has given them all additional illustrations.  His illustration style of broad lines, bright colors and bold patterns in the manner of Eric Carle augments each poem beautifully whether it's about rain softly falling, a danelion blowing in the wind or two people watching a train go by.<br />It is, of course, singularly difficult to review a book of this type because it's impossible to duplicate the exact layout of these poems which stretch, splish and splash across the pages.  To put the poems into single lines stacked on top of one another in word-processor format would be to ruin them and take all the fun out of this splendid work.  You therefore have to see them in all their glory on the page with Mr. Raschka's illustrations.<br />I've used this book a few times in my own classroom to inspire students who are less than enthusiastic about writing poetry.  Making concrete poetry (or \\"form poetry\\" as I called it in school) offers readers and students a different perspective on what is often considered a mundane form of writing.  A lot of fun and highly recommended!	2002-01-04

He's a quiet, thoughtful man, and obviously kind, but he has the strange habit of always wearing a long sleeved shirt, even during the heat of the summer.<br />One night when her parents go out for the evening and grandpa is washing up the dishes, the girl notices a large set of numbers tattooed on his forearm.  When she asks him what they are, he quickly covers the numbers up. \\"It's time you told her\\", the girl's mother says, coming into the kitchen.<br />Grandpa leads her to the living room and carefully begins to tell her the story of where those numbers came from.  He explains about Hitler:  \\"he was a wild man.  He waved his arms and shouted about the Jews.  And, when he shouted, thousands of people shouted, too.\\"  He tells her how the Jews were beaten, sometimes killed, forced to wear yellow stars, and-- most monstrous of all-- how they were shipped off to concentration camps and labled as \\"enemies of the state.\\"  With tears in his eyes, he tells her how the Jews were often tortured, beaten or killed.  \\"'I was one of the lucky ones,' Grandpa said.  `I survived.'\\"  In the end, the little girl tells her grandfather that it is the Nazis who should be ashamed of what happened, not him, and he re-rolls his sleeves up to go back and take care of those dinner dishes.<br />\\"The Number on My Grandfather's Arm\\" is a powerful story, made all the more so because it is illustrated with B&amp;W photographs not only of the girl and her grandfather, but of Hitler and of the persecuted Jews.  One very powerful photo is of a disheveled, clearly hungry man with his fingers laced through a chain-link fence and a yellow star sewn to his jacket.  For an adult, it is a haunting image and for a child I imagine it would provoke many questions.<br />The book is short and sparsely illustrated, but will undoubtedly pose many questions for the young reader than it will answer, chief among them \\"how did this happen?\\" (a question a good many scholars and academics are STILL asking today).  Mr. Adler does not answer this Big Question for us, presumably leaving it up to the parents/families of the reader to explain in their own way man's cruelty to other men and how an atrocity like the Holocaust could happen in the first place.  The history of the persecution of the Jews and WWII is very short and simplified in this short book, but this is to be expected considering that the book is written for very young children.<br />If I have any criticism about the book it is with the illustrations.  For a work of this magnitude-- that is, one that will inevitably ask more questions than it answers and is clearly about the Big Issues-- I would have expected more photographs and for them to be in color.  The story, while well written, seems much more sparse and almost dated by the use of the B&amp;W photos.  Still, it's an important work and one that is highly recommended for sparking discussion about this terrible and pivotal period in world history.did this happen?\\" (a question a good many scholars and academics are STILL asking today).

With over 30 books to his name, he has also published stories electronically, in serial installments, written for telivision and with \\"L.T.'s Theory of Pets\\", published this audio-only short story.<br />King himself reads the story, and for those who are familiar with his reading his own material like \\"Needful Things\\" or \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\", his Maine accent is as comfortable as a down comforter.  At the beginning of the CD he reminds us, in his dry, Maine wit, that we are, after all, \\"all going to die someday,\\" and then cautions the audience by asking them to remember if they left the shower curtain open or closed.  Nervous laughter is heard from the live audience.<br />The story, read live at London's Royal Festival Hall, concerns a man named L.T. who is fond of telling the strange story of how his wife left him, concluding with his theory of pets.  It seems that L.T. and his now estranged wife have bought each other pets that turned out to be totally incompatable with the intended owner.<br />In a kind of macabre variation on \\"Gift of the Maji\\", L.T. buys his wife a cat as a present, but the animal despises it's new owner with a passion, instead lavishing attention on L.T.  In a similar fit of pique, his wife buys L.T. a jack russell terrier that takes an immediate dislike to L.T., even though it's supposed to be his dog.  Though L.T., telling his story to his work buddies during lunch break, injects lots of humor into his story, the reader (technically, LISTENER in this case) begins to see that the animals represent the humans and all the flaws in their relationship.<br />As an author, sometimes King's short stories and novellas draw a reader in deeper than any of his 1,000+ page opuses.  Though the story lacks the in-your-face, monsters-leaping-out-to-eat-your-face-off horror elements often associated with King, the story draws the reader in because of it's easy, conversational tone--you can just see L.T. sitting there, casually spooling out his tale-- and the way  it keeps you psychologically tense for it's ending.<br />King is a masterful reader, never stumbling over any of his words or becoming even momentarily tongue-tied, and countrified-Mainer character, L.T., simply comes to life in the imagination of the listener, King-style:  \\"\\"When a person gets up in the morning he doesn't have the slightest idea how much may have changed in his life by the time he lays his head down again that night.  `Ye know not the hour or the day,' the Bible says.  I believe that particular verse is about dying, but it fits everything else, boys, everything else in the world.  You just never know when you're gonna bust a fiddle string.\\"<br />For the Constant Reader (King's term for his die-hard fans), \\"L.T.'s Theory of Pets\\" is a definite must-read.  My only complaint with the CD comes not from any lack on the part of Mr. King, but on behalf of the publishers.  At the beginning of the CD King makes reference to a  question &amp; answer period to follow after the reading of the story.  This is completely left off the CD, which is sin of the highest degree.  Despite numerous websites dedicated to his writing, books published about the man and his work (anyone read \\"The Stephen King Universe\\"??) Mr. King is a very private man.  Rarely does he grant interviews or talk openly about his writing or his writing process.  For a publisher, then, to NOT publish one of the very rare, informal Q&amp;A sessions that he DOES grant is a terrible oversight, IMHO.  I award Simon &amp; Schuster several brownie points for recording/publishing this story that we would have otherwise missed, but I have to take several points AWAY for not including the entire evening.<br />Nonetheless, Q&amp;A session or not, the story comes highly recommended from this Constant Reader.n just see L.T. sitting there, casually spooling out his tale-- and the way  it keeps you psychologically tense for it's ending.<br />King is a masterful reader, never stumbling over any of his words or becoming even momentarily tongue-tied, and countrified-Mainer character, L.T., simply comes to life in the imagination of the listener, King-style:  \\"\\"When a person gets up in the morning he doesn't have the slightest idea how much may have changed in his life by the time he lays his head down again that night.  `Ye know not the hour or the day,' the Bible says.

Why not call it a \\"gronk\\" or \\"whooba-loop\\" or something completely different??  Who decided that the thing we walk on is a \\"floor\\" and what's above our heads is \\"sky\\"??  They could have just as easily been called something different, right??  Why are some words short and others long? (why, for example, is the word \\"abbreviation\\" 12 letters long, I've always wondered...).  In their book \\"Fibblestax\\", Mr. Scillian and Ms. Darnell give their interpretation of where words REALLY come from.<br />\\"I dreamed again of Fibblestax, sitting among his books / Peering into the candlelight with a calm, thoughtful look. / For he's the one who gives a name to every single thing. / If not for him we couldn't talk.  Or read, or write, or sing.\\"<br />So begins this richly illustrated story for young children of how, in a place somewhere in the misty depths of time and place, the mop-haired Fibblestax invents names for all the things we know so well.  He's the one who decided to call a cat a \\"cat\\" and a dog a \\"dog.\\"  He decided that the small furry animal with whiskers should be called a \\"mouse\\" and the larger one a \\"rat.\\"<br />However, it wasn't always this way.  Long before Fibblestax was the namer of all things, there was a grumpy, scowling man named Carr who gave names to everything.  He was a \\"red-faced man who sat on a hickory trunk, and he gave terrible names to wonderful things like toad and snake and skunk.\\"  He's the one responsible for all those terribly complicated English words like \\"sphere\\" and \\"xylophone\\" (and, I'm presuming, \\"abbreviation\\").<br />One day, while Fibblestax was talking to Carr beside a stream, he mentions that \\"this goobywickus in my cup, it looks more like cream.\\"  Fibblestax also notes that other things seem misnamed to him; \\"hootch-baroos\\", for example, look more like birds and the word \\"flowers\\" sounds much better than Carr's word, \\"gunnywunks.\\"<br />A naming contest ensues between the sour Carr and the kind Fibblestax as to who will be the namer of all things.  When the mayor asks what should be the name of the wet stuff that falls from the sky, Carr proposes to call it \\"droog\\" while Fibblestax quietly suggests it should be called \\"rain.\\"  You can guess what the ending will be the outcome of such a contest, with Carr suggesting names like \\"Poonies\\" for soup crackers and other ridiculous words.<br />\\"Fibblestax\\" is one of those rare gems in picture books, a blend of wonderful text and fantastically rich illustrations.  Ms. Darnell lavishly illustrates each page in muted colors and soft crosshatch.  The characters are gently and realistically rendered, from the scruffy Carr in his red cap and long boot who resembles a cross between a pirate and a lumberjack, and the soft-spoken, tousle-haired Fibblestax.  The text is easy, large and rhymes in a way that will easily draw any child into the story.<br />For any child who may have asked, \\"mommy, where do words come from?\\" or who has ever invented their own words for something, \\"Fibblestax\\" is an excellent choice to add to the collection.

Later in life as a professional writer and college instructor, he became curious about Buddhism.  Specifically he became curious about how Buddhism and Zen would incorporate itself into the Judeo-Christian society of the United States where Buddhism is taking root.  With more and more people meditating, going to Zen retreats and business seminars on mediation principals for relaxation, is there, he wondered, such an animal as American Buddhism??<br />American life is so hectic and full of multitasking demands:  we read while we eat, talk on the phone while we drive, etc.  Is there space in the complicated, busy American life for something as simple as sitting still and meditating??  Do we even have the TIME??  Mr. Moore asks:  \\"Compassion, enlightenment, mindfulness, karma-- these are all wonderful gifts, perhaps-- but except those members of the Rockefeller or Lue family who practice Buddhism, non many of us can, in reality, just sit on a cushion and breathe...  If I am going to be a Buddhist, and stay married, hold my job, walk with two feet on the ground, how do I do it?\\"<br />In the process of investigating Buddhism in America Mr. Moore visits a sleek Zen monastery in New York as well as a poor, \\"please pardon our dust, we're remodeling... constantly\\" Tibetan retreat in rural West Virginia.  He hears the Dali Lama, and  interviews the editor of \\"Tricycle:  the Buddhist Review\\" magazine.  The more he learns about Buddhism in the U.S., the more he comes to find that to the Western mind, Buddhism is like holding wet soap:  the harder you squeeze, the more it slips out of your fingers.  What's fascinating though is not so much what he finds out-- how to sit, how to meditate, how to breathe, the Four Noble Truths, what to call a meditation cushion (\\"zafu\\")-- but how he slowly finds himself wondering if he's becoming Buddhist:  \\"Before long, I, too, was hooked.  I hadn't counted on actually liking it.\\"<br />Readers should note that this is not a book ABOUT Buddhism, nor will it teach one how to become a Buddhist.  Mr. Moore explores a good deal of different types of Buddhism in the states, but it's more of a journal of experiences in these different areas than it is a  history or how-to.  It is the story of one man's curiosity and exploration into this practice that is so often enigmatic to the Western mind.  Like an anthropologist, Mr. Moore first goes to experience and observe, and one day finds himself living among the natives because he finds that this way of life suits him.  If you're looking for a history of Buddhism or a how two, you won't find it here.  If you're finding yourself thinking, like Mr. Moore, \\"now, what is this all about?\\" or if you like to read other peoples experiences, this is an excellent starting point.

He&#8217;s also in the habit of not doing anything because, as he says, in life he was the King of England.  \\"In your former life you were a horse thief!\\" says Hob, pointing an accusing finger.  One of those pointless arguments ensues&#8212;- \\"King!\\", yells Bones, \\"horse thief!\\" yells Hob, \\"King!\\", \\"horse thief!!\\", \\"KING!!\\", etc etc etc&#8212;- and Bones decides that he&#8217;s not going to stand around and be insulted by the likes of Hob Goblin, and off he goes!<br />Hob decides that living with a talkative, big-headed skeleton is not for the likes of him and decides to go off to the big city to seek out a slave that WILL do something around the house and not have grand ideas about being the King of England!!  Casting a spell on a branch of ragwort so it grows to tremendous size, Hob and his frog, Mud, fly off to the big city full of people to capture a slave in Hob&#8217;s black bag.<br />The first house has a large sign on it that says Happy Halloween, and the house has cutouts of pumpkins, witches and ghosts on it.  Hob isn&#8217;t sure what that is all about, but he IS sure that Mr. Happy Halloween who lives in the house will probably make a fine cleaning staff who will be better than that good-for-nothing Bones Jones!!<br />Of course, this begins a series of funny misunderstandings as person after person thinks that Hob is someone dressed up in a REALLY grand Halloween costume, and instead of him bagging a potential slave, people keep tossing wrapped pieces of candy and goodies into his black bag.  As Hob is misunderstood, laughed at and even entered into a costume party competition, he begins to see that living with a skeleton isn&#8217;t so bad after all; even one who is fond of furniture polish and boasts of being royalty.<br />In the end, of course, Hob asks Bones Jones to forgive him and they have a fine feast on the candy that Hob has collected.<br />\\"Hob Goblin and the Skeleton\\" is a fine Halloween story, ....  The text is fun to read and flows well.  There is ample opportunity for the reader to use funny voices for Hob, Bones and the other characters in the book.

She also plans to use the book to show that one does not need a million different crayons or pots of paint to make beautiful pictures&#8212;- a common pencil can create wonders.<br />While I generally like ANY story dealing with Halloween, I am especially fond of the message of this book.  Many times children will, in a fit of pique, tell their closest friends that they don&#8217;t like them because they did or didn&#8217;t do some particular thing, or because some little habit of theirs (like forever spraying yourself with furniture polish!) makes the other crazy.

We meet characters with fantastic names like Walter Lackwards (who's head is on backwards) and Mr. McFyfe (who sat on his wife) who have some delightful misadventures through the book.  My personal favorite, which demonstrates the silliness of the rhymes, is this one:<br />THE MAN WHO INSISTS THAT HE DOENS'T EXIST A man who insists That he doesn't exist Keeps jumping in puddles of mud. &quot;I'm glad I'm not here,&quot; He says, &quot;for I fear &quot;If I were, I'd be covered with crud.&quot;<br />The illustration shows a man positively COATED with gooey brown mud slipping through a pigpen while holding a dainty cup of afternoon tea.  Such are the absurdities of illustrator Kevin Hawkes.<br />As a teacher, I have found that poetry generally leaves students and young readers cold.  Given a choice, most students would prefer to clean out their desks than to write poetry. This is not the case when Mr. Grossman and Mr. Hawkes enter the classroom!!  The easy, flowing rhyme and simple A,A,B,C,C,B rhyme structure of the poems makes them lots of fun to listen to and read over and over again.  After reading the book, many students, even WITHOUT my prompting, ask if they could write their own &quot;Timmothy Tunny&quot; poems. For a teacher, any book that encourages or inspires students to write creatively of their own accord is worth it's weight in gold!!<br />The illustrations by Mr. Hawke are large and colorful, filling the whole page to the edges.  The colors are vibrant and lively so each page seems to sing out to the reader. I have even seen an art teacher use this book as an example of characture:  how to draw peoples' faces to show different emotion and perspective.<br />Older students and children will like the play on words and the inspiration to create their own poems, and younger children will love the splashy, fun illustrations of Squeaky Clean Keith (who always brushed his teeth) or Skinny Young Jane (who managed to go down the drain).  Readers who enjoy this book should also read the other Grossman/Hawkes picture book, &quot;My Little Sister Swallowed One Hare&quot;.<br />Highly recommended!like the play on words and the inspiration to create their own poems, and younger children will love the splashy, fun illustrations of Squeaky Clean Keith (who always brushed his teeth) or Skinny Young Jane (who managed to go down the drain).

Some of the most well-known works by him are &quot;Fifth Business&quot;, &quot;The Manticore&quot;, &quot;What's Bred in the Bone&quot; and &quot;Murther and Walking Spirits.&quot;  Most readers of Davies will know him first and foremost as an author and second as a scholar of Elizabethan theatre;  &quot;Shakespeare's Boy Actors&quot; is but one of his more academic works on the subject.<br />However, most Americans do not know of the years that Davies was the Master of Massey College at the University of Toronto in Canada.  While there, it became his habit to tell a ghost story every year for the college's Christmas staff party.  Thirteen of these ghostly (yet often quite hysterical stories) are contained here.  Beginning with the first, &quot;Revelation from a Smoky Fire&quot;, in which Davies is visited by an apparition who seems to be from the college's FUTURE, and moving on through &quot;The Ugly Spectre of Sexism&quot; and &quot;The Pit Whence Ye Are Digged&quot;, these ghost tales are far less horrific and spooky than they are highly amusing. For example, when dealing with the sudden appearance of what is most likely a ghost that has appeared in his own office and, furthermore, assumes that Davies has come down the chimney, he writes, &quot;I grasped immediately the sort of man I was dealing with. This was a madman! It is one of my cardinal rules to always humor madmen. It comes second nature to me. I do it several times each day.&quot;<br />These stories, like much of Davies's work, is highly scholarly, with a turn of phrase and vocabulary that often verges on that seen in Victorian English novels. People who have read a great deal, or who have gone to graduate school in the fine arts or for literature, will catch the subtle barbs and digs that Davies directs at the ivory tower nature of academia and even himself as Master of the college. The stories were first intended to be read aloud for an academic audience of professors, so they are meant more to amuse and tickle the wit than to accompany the more traditional Halloween stories or his other novels or scholarly works.<br />Potential readers should note that there was at one time an audio version of this book published with an introduction by the author with the reading performed by Christopher Plummer. As I understand it, this audio version is currently out of print.  This is a dreadful shame because Mr. Plummer gives an exceptional performance of Mr. Davies's work. Also, as mentioned, these stories were intended to be read aloud for a gathering of people on an evening, and what could be better than HEARING these ghostly tales??  If anyone finds themselves enjoying these stories, they would be well advised to track down the audio version!<br />Canada lost a fine writer, critic, playwright and journalist in 1996 when Mr. Davies passed away. His books are still enjoyed today as much as ever, and for those who are seeking out a less heavy, light and amusing work by him, one simply cannot go wrong with &quot;High Spirits.&quot;  Highly recommended- by this Davies fan!!e read aloud for an academic audience of professors, so they are meant more to amuse and tickle the wit than to accompany the more traditional Halloween stories or his other novels or scholarly works.<br />Potential readers should note that there was at one time an audio version of this book published with an introduction by the author with the reading performed by Christopher Plummer.

This new universe is populated by the gods and myths of old Earth:  Zeus, faries, Merlin, Loki.  The teens are quickly learning that Everworld is not a safe place for anyone who is not immortal:  viking hordes raid the countryside, an  Aztec god demands human sacrifice, wild animals speak and the very plants can be dangerous.  Meanwhile, terrible creatures called the Hetwan roam the countryside looking to capture the gods of Everworld for their deity, Ka Anor, the god eater.<br />April, Jalil, David and Christopher have come to this world because of a fourth modern-day teen, Senna.  Senna is some sort of witch with the power to cross from one world to the other.  She is wanted by the evil god Loki so he can escape Everworld, she is wanted by the famous Merlin the Magician to prevent Ka Anor from finding new worlds, and she is wanted by Ka Anor so that he (it??) may find other worlds to enslave and conquer.<br />In each of the books there is some sort of central conflict or problem that must be solved (or, at the very least, lived through or escaped from).  In Realm of the Reaper, the teens find themselves in a strange city composed entirely of men.  Not all of them human men, but all men nonetheless.  As it turns out, they are to be &quot;fresh meat&quot;, if you will, for Loki's daughter:  the half-dead, half-alive Hel  Hel is a creature like nothing the foursome has encountered before:  a creature capable of ripping men's minds apart with lust and revulsion.<br />K.A. Applegate is the author of the popular &quot;Animorphs&quot; series for younger readers.  She has broken new and exciting ground with this series.  Each book is narrated by a different character of the foursome, and this one is told from the perspective of Jalil, the one African-American male of the group who is also the most scientifically-minded of the four.  Through the first three books, the reader could tell that of the four, Jalil was having the most difficulty coping with the chaos of Everworld.  Things do not follow classical scientific principals in Everworld, and magic is definitely real.  We also discover why Jalil was drawn to Senna, for each character has a connection to her.<br />Applegate's writing is beginning to pick up the pace.  This book defiinetly has tiny hints of eroticism and sexuality that weren't present before, and the language is getting a bit more crude (though most teen readers of this series will have read and spoken far worse themselves).  Some reviewers feel that this is a detriment to the series or may not be appropriate for young readers.  As a teacher, I have not used more than two of these books in the classroom, but I can report that part of it's appeal to teen audiences is not only the swiftly moving plot, but it's realism.  The last time I looked, teens were frequently using mild language and their culture was pretty saturated with sexual innuendo and references to pop culture.  As one of my students put it, &quot;Ms. Applegate doesn't shy away from the stuff that makes the book real.  Stuff like feelings and anger and death.&quot;  He later went on to say that when one is running away from a half-dead goddess who intends to destroy you in the most cruel way, you wouldn't merely say &quot;oh, rats!&quot;  In other words, in part BECAUSE the characters do speak of such things like sex n' drugs n' rock-n-roll that the book is believable.<br />Readers looking for a fast-paced, engrossing read would do well to check out this new series.irst three books, the reader could tell that of the four, Jalil was having the most difficulty coping with the chaos of Everworld.

US	52961594	R37EHRXN9PT8GL	0746027702	820184036	The Usborne Book of Everyday Words in German (Everyday Words Series) (German Edition)	Books	4	18	20	N	N	Excellent reference!! (needs English translations, though!)	Most children like to play with words or learn new words for common things they already know in English.  My 7 year old has a whole slew of such words that she likes to use, everything from the French word for &quot;ridiculous&quot; (&quot;ridicule&quot;) to the Yiddish word &quot;feh!&quot;, meaning &quot;yuck&quot; (a very satisfying and fun word to use).  She has been curious about German words, but until I stumbled across this Usborne book, there was very little I could find that would keep her interest.<br />This book is excellent on a number of different levels.  In addition to having over 500 common words in German (mostly nouns), the illustrations are detailed and exemplary.  The words are laid out around a large, central illustration that covers one theme, like &quot;der garten&quot; (the garden), &quot;das wohnzimmer&quot; (the living room) or &quot;der bauernhof&quot; (the farm).  The words themselves are illustrated with small pictures of the named objects, like &quot;die kuh&quot; for a cow, &quot;die uhr&quot; for a clock or &quot;das T-shirt&quot; for a you-know-what!  These objects are used again in the large illustration, so part of the book's appeal is it's seek-and-find quality.  Looking at the picture of the garage, can you find a match?  A moth?  A pail?  How about &quot;der schraubenschlussel&quot; (a wrench)?  They're actually trickier to find than you might think, so the book will maintain a child's interest after they grow tired of reading the German words.<br />The illustrations themselves are incredibly detailed, appearing to be made out of clay and material.  A kindly grandfather is complete with white hair, bushy moustache and green checked shirt.  A boy's hair is composed of individual strips of clay and the dog is seen running off with an ice cream cone in his mouth (that is, der hund with die eis in der mund).  The people and children are multicultural and gender balanced.  Clearly, it took untold hours to illustrate this work.<br />Parents and teachers should note this book is more of a reference than anything else.  Children are not likely to sit down and read it cover to cover, nor will it teach you how to speak German-- just common nouns and numbers are in the book.  There is an extensive vocabulary key in the back pages consisting of three columns:  the German word, it's phonetic spelling/pronunciation and it's English meaning.  There is also a short note explaining that German nouns (like French and Spanish) are female, male or neutral, hence the use of the words &quot;der&quot;, &quot;das&quot; and &quot;die&quot;, which all mean &quot;the&quot; in English.<br />Readers should also note that the English word for the object is NOT printed on the page with the object's German word, which is a bit of an oversight in my opinion.  Children just learning to read English will have nothing IN English to read on any of the pages, and it's unlikely a beginning reader will attempt to tackle the pronunciation guide at the back.  Also, at the top of each page is an object with a note like &quot;such sechs cassetten&quot;, which is not translated.  Only after a long time of looking through the book (and discovering the vocabulary hidden at the very back of the book) did I realize that this was encouraging the reader to &quot;search for six cassettes&quot; on the page.  While there is the possibility that children may easily become frustrated with the long, multi-consonant spellings of German words like &quot;wachsmalstifte&quot; (crayon), a number of English and German words are the same, like &quot;T-shirt&quot;, &quot;kiwi&quot;, &quot;hammer&quot;, &quot;jeans&quot; and &quot;button&quot;, and a lot of everyday words are very similar to English words like &quot;hund&quot; (dog or hound) and &quot;katze&quot; (cat). This adds it's own search-and-find element of fun for older children who are fluent with English words.<br />The book will probably be the most useful for young children who are in bilingual German/English families.  It has a place in a home or school library as a reference book or search-and-find game book, and hence I recommend it.ual German/English families.

Advertising has been around since the dawn of civilization.  The ancient Greeks created signs for their theatres and any open-air market of any ancient culture shows evidence of signage advertising different wares.  With the invention of the printing press and movable type, however, the age of information and advertising truly began.<br />The history of American advertising is as packed with dates, places, people and events as any other slice of American history, and in &quot;Soap, Sex and Cigarettes&quot; Juliann Sivulka has done an exhaustive job of outlining these very things.  With chapters going from 1492-1800, beginning with the colonization of the States, through the Roaring 20's and ending with &quot;1990s and Beyond:  The Media Revolution&quot;, this book should be required reading for any marketing/advertising undergrad.  Indeed, considering the density of the material-- as thorough as any text on the Revolutionary War-- I imagine it IS required collegiate reading for students entering these professions.<br />The book is packed with various illustrations of real ads from the time periods, and one could easily get an overview of American advertising by simply leafing through the pages and looking at the ads and how they evolve from a 1608 London woodcut pamphlet advertising the New World (&quot;Excellent fruites by Planting in Virginia&quot;) to the modern &quot;Just Do It&quot; and &quot;Got Milk?&quot; high glossy ad campaigns.  The text is ordered and well written and can be read both as collegiate material and as casual reading (though there are a LOT of dates, places, times and events for the casual reader).  The author frequently includes common ad slogans throughout the book that have become staples of American advertising:  &quot;His masters voice&quot;, &quot;I'd walk a mile for a Camel&quot;, &quot;Remember:  only YOU can prevent forest fires&quot; and &quot;melts in your mouth, not in your hand&quot; to name just a VERY few.  There are also brief timelines of some of the highlights of product inventions that advertising impacted, such as Twinkies introduction in 1930 (originally filled with banana creme), pet rocks in 1975 and the new age of advertising begun in 1989 by Nissan's Infiniti where the actual product was never shown.<br />The book is subtitled &quot;A Cultural History of American Advertising&quot;, but it is here where it falls short.  It's an excellent resource for the history of advertising, but it's not so great at demonstrating how advertising has influenced our society.  There are short parts demonstrating the stereotype of people of color and women, for example African-American people portrayed as grinning Sambos who are thrilled to ecstasy that Gold Dust washing powder makes your pots n' pans sparkle; Asian people with long pigtails and coolie hats in outlandish dress; women typically in household roles advertising everything from soap to washing machines (while trying to appear sexy at the same time:  &quot;You'd think I'm a flapper, but I CAN keep house&quot;-- S.O.S. Pads, 1927).  However, this aspect is not nearly as well fleshed-out as I would have expected from the title.  I was expecting something more along the lines of cultural anthropology or Noam Chomsky-- explaining how advertising not only reflected society but INFLUENCED it-- and found little to be had.<br />No one would argue the fact that sex and celebrity status are constantly being used to sell everything from cars to toothpaste, and the unspoken meaning of most ads is something like &quot;Drink Figgy-Fiz Cola and you'll have to beat the beautiful babes away with a lug wrench!&quot;  Most people ignore advertisements or complain about them and generally pay little or no attention to them at all.  Still, the amount of advertising is only INCREASING as time goes on and the ads do influence our culture substantially.  Should you doubt me, ask yourself why were children murdering other children for Nike shoes during the late80's?  No one was attacking me for my black Keds, and God help you if you wore Buster Browns after the age of 4.  Why?  Because the ads told us there were certain products to value above others (and therefore we could justify paying 120% more for those products as well) and we believed them.  THIS sort of &quot;cultural history&quot; and analysis was missing from this book, which is a shame because Ms. Sivulka could have shed quite a lot of light onto this still-dark corner of our society.  Perhaps she didn't because the more we know about advertising and how it works, the less power it holds over us.<br />In closing, &quot;Soap, Sex and Cigarettes&quot; is a great resource both for the professional marketer/advertiser and a fascinating read for the casual thinker of pop/modern culture.  It's a bit expensive (though college texts always are), but it's exhaustively researched and very well written.  Highly recommended!80's?

Those undead, mindless, soulless creatures of nightmares are at the core of the second book in the \\"Anita Blake, Vampire Slayer\\" series.<br />Anita Blake has an affinity with the dead, and is a professional  Animator.  That is, she can raise the recently dead from the grave as zombies. This is an employable talent in a futuristic world where the dead can be called up to do everything from testify in court to act as grisly house servants.  Anita's second job, executing renegade vampires who are otherwise protected by law, is downplayed much more in this work than in the first.  Still, the  short, plucky animator who has been dubbed &quot;The Executioner&quot; by the vampires of St. Louis will need all her talents to stay alive in this second work.<br />Blake is called upon by a rich business owner to animate a 200-year-old corpse.  Blake refuses, because to raise something that old will require far more than just the blood of a goat or a chicken:  a human being must be sacrificed.  Blake may not have a problem doing away with dangerous vampires, but murdering humans to raise a two-century-old zombie is neither in her job or ethical contract.<br />However, true to the first book, this is far from the only thing going  on in the story.  In addition to the rich man's offer to make Anita rich as well by raising the dead (although, making her a murderer in the process) and her defending herself against his goons who are, ah, *encouraging* her to take the job, there is the much more pressing problem of a renegade zombie that is literally tearing families to pieces.  Anita's attempts to enlist the help of the country's most powerful voodoo priestess seems only to complicate matters, and Anita's suspicions about the priestess's involvement in the possible rogue zombie murders only manages to get Anita into deeper trouble yet.  Reviewers note:  don't make one of the world's most powerful voodoo priests angry at you!!<br />Meanwhile, there is also the not-so-small matter of the master vampire of the city who is trying to entice Anita to become his human servant (with The Executioner as his servant, his reputation would be powerful beyond words; vampires are SUCH political creatures!).<br />This is the second Anita Blake novel I've read after finishing \\"Guilty Pleasures\\", the first in the Blake series.  As in the first book, the story is gritty, dark and wholly enticing.  In a futuristic world, vampires are protected by law (unless they go on a rampage, in which case warrants for their destruction can be issued), and they have taken on a creepshow sort of attraction.  The Laughing Corpse is the name of a vampire comedy club that young, mostly hip urban folk flock to because of the oddity and possible danger.  Blake herself has seen too much of these undead creatures to be fooled by witty repartee, however.<br />Part detective story, part police investigation and part horror, the Anita Blake novels are gearing up to be the sort of stories that will hook even casual readers.  There is a good deal of action, mystery, investigation and-- in the case of this story-- gore to keep the attention of most adult readers.  Indeed, this story has more than it's share of gore than the previous novel as whole families are quite literally ripped to shreds by the zombie and... ahem... eaten.<br />Still, Hamilton has a masterful grasp of the language and describes the horror of a post-zombie attack police investigation without allowing the narrative to become \\"spatterpunk\\"-- rivers of gore and buckets of blood-- and she allows much of the visuals to be left up to the reader's imagination.  Hence, those with weak stomachs and vivid imaginations may wish to reconsider whether or not they want to read this work.<br />Blake herself is a believable character; a mixture of tough-as-nails slayer of the undead who nonetheless secretly collects stuffed toy penguins.  If YOUR job was to decapitate chickens to raise rotting corpses and crawl through filthy crypts to destroy dangerous vampires, you would need a childlike connection to innocence as well.  This is a nice touch that allows us to more fully believe in both Blake as a person and the weird place the world has become with it's frank and open dealings with the supernatural.<br />True to the first book, there are sudden plot twists that fly at you from nowhere, and just when you think everything is neatly solved and we can go home now and take a long, hot shower, WHAM! we're blindsided by something else even more horrifying.  The climax of \\"Laughing Corpse\\" is as surprising and tense as any grand work of suspense fiction and will make it impossible to put the book down.<br />More thrilling than horrifying (I had no trouble sleeping, nor was I tempted to peek in my closet and under the bed after reading this book), readers who are looking for a fast-paced thriller would do well to turn their attentions to this series.  It is not necessary to read the first to read the second, but I would recommend it-- there are some subtle references that would be lost if one did not first start with \\"Guilty Pleasures\\", which is a fine read in itself.<br />Hats off, Ms. Hamilton.  Fine work and my thanks to you.ise rotting corpses and crawl through filthy crypts to destroy dangerous vampires, you would need a childlike connection to innocence as well.

US	52961594	R3G8OENTUUQ6P5	1580631606	855950234	The Stephen King Universe	Books	3	11	12	N	N	Exhaustive resource of The Master�s work	Stephen King is one of the most prolific authors of American 20th-21st century literature, hands down.  With approximately 300 million books in print worldwide and more than 30 book titles to his name (to say nothing of screenplays and adaptations), he enjoys a popularity that is unrivaled by any other contemporary author.  His books have been made into movies, audio versions, and e-books.  As of this writing, there are at least 3 more screenplays in the works and at least that many new novels on the horizon.<br />What makes Mr. King different from many other authors is how interconnected all his works are.  The same characters pop up in different, seemingly unrelated works:  the evil Randall Flagg, for example, is a pivotal character in both \\"The Stand\\" and \\"Eyes of the Dragon\\".  Minor characters are constantly turning up and playing bit roles in his fiction.<br />The main thrust of \\"The Stephen King Universe\\" (abbreviated as SKU by the authors themselves) is to explore just how interconnected the works of Mr. King are.  They submit that Mr. King envisions more than one reality than just the one we live in (called the \\"prime reality\\"), but the gateways between these worlds is starting to break down, allowing people and things to cross over from one to the other.  At the heart of this multiverse (multiple universes) is The Dark Tower:  the axis on which all other realities (including ours) rotate.<br />The authors classify the works of Mr. King into different categories, each one of which is examined in depth.  For example, \\"The Dark Tower\\" discusses the books in that series as well as characters who are drawn in from other works:  Ted Brautigan is a renegade Breaker in the book, \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\", for example.  The fictional town of Derry, Maine, is a common setting for a lot of King's works, including \\"It\\" and \\"The Sun Dog\\", and stories that take place there are noted in a separate chapter.<br />Other King fans have noted that this book has some errors in it.  Though I've read about 85% of the works of Mr. King, I myself have found this book only helpful and revealing to the SKU, noticing more interconnections in his works than outright errors.

Everworld is a strange and dangerous place for 4 teens from the modern world.  Vikings, wizards, dragons and ancient Aztec gods who require human sacrifice all inhabit this strange place where the gods and myths of ancient Earth have gone.  Four teenagers, Christopher, Jalil, April and David, were all pulled into this place by a fifth-- Senna-- who somehow opened some sort of gateway in the fabric of reality and sucked them in.<br />The second book in the series concerned the foursome's capture and eventual escape from a gang of fierce, bloodthirsty Aztecs and ended with a dragon attack.  The third book, \\"Enter the Enchanted\\" picks up right where the second left off.  Typical to the series, the book grabs you by the throat within the first pages and doesn't let go of you until the last.  This time, the teens are joining forces with the legendary knights of King Arthur, while trying to escape the dangers of Merlin the magician.<br />At the heart of the battles between god and wizard lies Senna, the strange girl who is somehow attached in some way to all four of the teenagers and who seems to be the key to getting back home.  Problem is, of course, Senna is some kind of witch, and very much wanted by both the powerful Merlin and Loki, the Norse god of destruction.  The four teens are stuck in the middle, still trying to just UNDERSTAND Everworld, and struggling to somehow get out of it before they succumb to the evils and dangers of this strange place they're in.<br />K.A. Applegate is the author of the popular \\"Animorphs\\" series and has outdone herself with this, the Everworld series.  Consisting of 12 books, each character narrates one of the stories in turn.  In \\"Enter the Enchanted\\", April, the half-sister of Senna, tells the story.  We are therefore able to get deeper into each character, explore their personality and motivations in a way that would otherwise be impossible.  Subtle connections are made when we learn more about each character, and this allows the reader to know them well and it makes them so much more believable, more real.<br />The series moves at a lightning fast pace which will keep even reluctant teen readers going.  It plays out in the mind like a high-adrenaline adventure movie, keeping you on the edge of your seat and keeping you guessing not only what will happen next, but what is the very nature of this place called Everworld?<br />Fights happen, blood is shed, people die, and the 4 teens make sharp wisecracks at each other, so there is plenty of action to keep your interest.  However, the violence is not gratuitous, it's realistic.  When battling ancient gods that require human sacrifice or going head to head with snakes the size of an el-train, there is going to be a certain amount of mildly foul language and bloodshed.  Too little of it and the book is goody-goody, not realistic and the reader looses interest.  Too much, and it becomes offensive or simply gross spatterpunk and is a turn-off.  Applegate nicely balances everything out to keep us reading.<br />By the third book, the nature of Everworld is becoming clearer, but not crystal.  Senna has a nasty habit of appearing and disappearing as it suits her plans, and the teens still aren't sure exactly how they feel about her.  Applegate does an excellent job of capturing the hot and cold running emotions of young adults caught in a dangerous, impossible situation where their lives, to say nothing of their sanity, is threatened at every turn.  The only way to get OUT of Everworld, it would seem, is with Senna's help.  IF they live to find her.  IF Senna herself is willing to help.  IF Senna wants to go back to the real world, and doesn't have any plans of her own.  Some rather big IF's.<br />I used the first book in the series in a reading class I teach, and was somewhat shocked to see how fast my students devoured it-- my students who normally don't read unless they're absolutely forced to.  Though we've stopped reading the series as a class after the second novel, most of those students have gone on to devour the rest of the books (one of my lowest-motivated students is actually closing in on the last book).  Clearly, there is something here to hold the readers interest, and I know a good many adults who are clipping through Ms. Applegate's series as well.  This universal appeal to both the target and non-target audiences is perhaps the most powerful recommendation that could be made for any book.  The language and violence may be a bit much for some readers, though I would argue that it's no worse than the stuff that is regularly trotted out on TV and in movies.  Perhaps less so, even.  Still, if you enjoy a good adventure with some fantasy, mythology and science fiction thrown in for good measure, you can't go wrong to begin on the Everworld series.s after the second novel, most of those students have gone on to devour the rest of the books (one of my lowest-motivated students is actually closing in on the last book).

Victor's parents leave him and his sister alone for a week or two while they go off to get their heads and their relationship together.  However, things really begin to get interesting when Victor's sister ALSO up and leaves to go with her friends on some sort of hippie camping trip! (yeah, the book is a bit dated...)  Victor, then, is left alone to fend for himself for the next two weeks.<br />He's a bright kid, and perfectly happy NOT to have his crazy older sister or his doting parents around.  He takes care of himself just fine, and one night over a TV dinner, he sees something verrrrry strange on the tube:  a band of lizards playing music!  What sort of program is THIS? he wonders-- it's not in the TV guide.<br />Giant lizards having an unreported jam session on late nite TV is just the beginning of the high weirdness, though.  Soon he runs into a gentleman known as the Chicken Man because of his dancing chicken that lives under his hat (apparently he gives one-man/one-chicken shows on public busses and dispenses wisdom-- By Appointment Only-- from the depot).  This Chicken Man character appears in the strangest of places and goes by some impossibly funny names and hints at Victor that he knows something about these lizards.<br />For a short time, the book turns into a sort of weird detective novel as Victor sets out to find out WHO the Chicken Man is, and WHAT are all these lizards doing??  Are they real??  How come no one else (including the manager of the TV station) knows anything about them??  Just what IS going on here??<br />Daniel Pinkwater is the author of a dozen books or so, many from the 1970's, of which almost all are still in print today (\\"The Hoboken Chicken Emergency\\", \\"Fat Men from Space\\", \\"The Big Orange Splot\\" and this title to name a few).  Staying in print for more than 20 years is no mean feat in a world where children's authors come and go and \\"one hit wonders\\" in books are as common as popular music.  I fancy the reason Mr. P. is still enjoying a good run and attracting new readers is because his books are genuinely funny and engaging.  There's lots of simple humor and ridiculous situations to draw in the early/beginning reader, and his writing has a sharp wit and play-on-words that older readers will enjoy as well.  Of the works he's written, \\"Lizard Music\\" is one of his best.<br />Readers should note, however, that like some of his other works, the plot of  \\"Lizard Music\\" picks up and goes into high gear about halfway through the book.  Yes, we find out a great deal more about these strange, instrument-playing lizards, but when we do, it feels like we're sprinting through the story.  Some situations, while funny, seem TOO absurd, like the plot has suddenly twisted off into left field for a few paragraphs before getting back on track.  It almost feels like Mr. Pinkwater was in a rush to finish and forgot to reread for clarity.<br />Still, this is a book geared to young readers who may not be as concerned about absurdities as older/adult readers.  Indeed, they may enjoy the book all the MORE because of the strange, unexpected twists.  If you are a Pinkwater fan, this is one of his better works and comes recommended.  If you are new to Mr. P's works, this is an excellent choice for the intermediate reader.  If you have a BEGINNING reader, I would highly recommend Mr. P's picture book, \\"The Big Orange Splot\\".<br />Thank you, Mr. Pinkwater!

The Folk Keeper Submitted 6/15/01<br />Corinna Stonewall is a Folk Keeper.  That is, in the strange and beautiful world of Ms. Billingsley's book, it is her job to lurk in the dark, cavernous underground Cellar distracting and pacifying the hideous Folk, creatures described by another Keeper as \\"mostly wet mouth and teeth.\\"  The Folk are constantly angry and ravenous-- never a good combination-- and they have the power to ruin crops, spoil milk, rot eggs and meat and cause animals to sicken and die.  Any estate or village, therefore, desperately needs their Folk Keeper, and Corinna knows this well.  Whereas anywhere else in the village she would merely be a slave or laborer, as Folk Keeper she has power and she knows it:  \\"here in the Cellar, I control the Folk.  Here, I'm queen of the world.\\"<br />Perhaps like all queens, Corinna has secrets, not the least of which is that she is pretending to be a boy, for no female can be Folk Keeper.  As Corin the Keeper of the Folk, she can spend long hours away from people, which allows her to keep her other secrets well hidden.  Secrets like how she is never cold, how she always knows the exact time, as if a clock were running through her veins, and how her hair grows two inches every night as she sleeps.<br />Some of these secrets are threatened when old, dying Lord Merton comes to her, and fetches her away to his vast estate where the lure of the sea and the power of controlling a great many more Folk tempts Corinna to leave her small village.  Once there, Corinna must contend with Folk that are far more fierce than those she's used to, a young man named Finian whom she forms a fast but tenuous friendship, and the enigmatic, possibly dangerous Sir Edward, who may be more than he appears.<br />Told in the form of a diary, the reader follows Corinna through her early stages of a Folk Keeper and how she managed to hide her secrets, to the surprising end where she discovers her true heritage and everything falls into place.  Corinna's language is poetic and beautiful, describing everything around her in languid eloquence.  Describing a party she attends on Midsummer's Eve, she writes in her journal:  \\"A footman handed me a glass.  Tiny lines of bubbles streamed through the pale liquid.  The fiddle cried out in a language that everyone but I understood.  Like pieces of a kaleidoscope, the ladies and gentlemen fell into patterns of color on the Ballroom floor.\\"<br />Ms. Billingsley is the author of \\"Well Wished\\", a title that won Best Book of the Year by School Library Journal.  In \\"The Folk Keeper\\", her second work, she has created a beautiful world and fine character in Corinna, one who is immediately likeable in spite of her rough exterior-- perhaps even BECAUSE of it.  As female characters go, Corinna is brave and inventive despite all of her stubbornness.  She is a strong character in an age where too many female leads are still portrayed as helpless shrinking violets.<br />As noted, the writing style of \\"Folk Keeper\\" is somewhere between prose and poetry--what a friend of mine calls \\"High English\\" of the almost Shakespearian sort.  Because very few people speak in High English (especially teens &amp; young adults for whom this book is geared toward), some readers-- especially those who are still not masterful at reading yet-- may miss out on the subtleties of the text or become confused.  Still, it is a brilliant work and highly recommended.<br />For those students or readers who find the eloquence of the book difficult, it is available in an unabridged audio format with a masterful performance by Ms. Marian Tomas Griffin.  I am a reading teacher and use both audio and text with my upper-grade students when we read this book.

It was just beginning to enter into people's homes and the dam had just burst wide open on a new way to communicate instantly with people as near as next door or as far away as the other side of the globe.  Chat rooms were opening all over the place and thousands of people were logging on to talk with other people in what was newly termed \\"realtime.\\"<br />Katie Tarbox was a 14 year old girl, living in the posh suburbs with a typical-yet-dysfunctional family.  Being intelligent and lonely, she logs onto the `Net and soon discovers a 21 year old man named Mark.  Mark is equally intelligent, likes many of the same things Katie does and provides her with the very thing Katie (and many, MANY other teens then and now) is starving for:  attention.  The ability to simply talk with someone and be listened to.<br />Time marches on.  Katie keeps talking with Mark until one day there arises a chance to actually MEET, face-to-face, at a hotel where Katie will be staying for a swimming competition.  She goes down to his room and, as you can guess, her life changes in a hearbeat.  \\"Mark\\" is an adult, in his mid-40's going under a false name and he abuses her.  Katie barely escapes what would undoubtedly be rape when her mother knocks at the door.<br />The story doesn't end here, of course.  In painful, yet clear language, Katie goes on to describe how her life turns to sheer hell for the next couple of years.  The relationship between her and her mother, never good to begin with, gets worse.  Her own feelings of attraction and betrayal over \\"Mark\\" constantly conflict within her.  Her friends dismiss her as a slut and the rumors fly.  There are court dates, lie detector tests and an involvement with the FBI.<br />\\"Katie.com\\" is not an easy book to read.  Anyone who is a parent, especially a parent of a daughter, will find this book a frightening commentary on our modern life.  A story similar to this one surfaces in the major media about once every two months or so, but rarely do we hear what happens AFTER the abuse; rarely do we hear how the event can destroy lives.<br />There has been a profound amount of criticism of this book, much of which I think is unfair.  Was it stupid for Katie to meet Mark alone in a hotel??  You bet.  Is it a sad commentary on her life and our culture that 14 year olds must seek out friendship from strangers on the Internet??  Absolutely.  Does she come from a wealthy family and community that should \\"know better\\"?  Yes.  Do teenagers do dumb things??  All the time.  I did `em, you did `em (and if you're young, you'll DO `em, guaranteed).  BUT, should we blame the victim??  No.<br />Some people think that her case is dismissable and she is a whiner simply because she was not actually harmed physically.  That seems to imply that a 45 year old man kissing and fondeling a 14 year old girl is acceptable as long as he doesn't actually force her into sex.  The equation seems to read: unwelcomed petting = OK, rape = not OK.  I don't think there is a doubt in anyone's mind what \\"Mark\\" WOULD have done if he hadn't been interrupted.  The reader needs to put themselves into Katie's shoes before they pass judgement on how a child who was nearly raped by a stranger over 30 years her senior should feel about the incident.<br />Other complaints I must address are the comments on the author's writing style.  Please do note that this is an 18 year old woman writing about an experience that happened when she was 14.  Hence, she is a young writer just starting out, and therefore will not come across yet as a seasoned voice.  Her text could be edited for grammar infractions, but that is missing the point:  Ms. Tarbox is a very talented writer, though her talent must be honed. She is young, and what's more she is writing about something extremely personal that was perhaps the biggest mistake she is likely to make in her life.She does so without embarrassment and handwringing.  While many others victims may wish to bury this part of their lives forever, Ms. Tarbox has decided to write about it to warn others who may find themselves in similar situations.  While it is very easy to say, \\"I'd never do that...\\", it is even harder to say, \\"I DID do that, and here's why YOU shouldn't.\\"r life.  She does so without embarrassment and handwringing.

Jack Flemming, ace reporter, had the unusual experience of waking up one evening to find that he was dead.  Actually, to find out he was UNdead-- apparently his old lover, Maureen, WASN'T kidding when she said she was a vampire!!<br />In \\"Bloodlist\\", the first book of the Vampire Files series, Jack was in the unique position of being able to track down his own murderers while gaining experience in his new \\"life\\" (I use the term loosely, here).  In the first book he teamed up with an actor-turned-P.I. named Charles, and the two formed a mutually beneficial relationship:  Jack's strength, heightened senses and ability to disappear aided Charles's investigations, while Charles had the helpful ability to move freely about in daylight.  The pair are back again in the second in the series, \\"Lifeblood\\".<br />This time around Jack is getting more comfortable with his new condition, but is trying to find his lost lover, Maureen, who mysteriously disappeared 5 years ago.  The search for her is suddenly complicated by Maureen's estranged (and possibly dangerous) sister and two bumbling-yet-dangerous vampire hunters who think Jack is some hideous creature of the night.  Nothing could be farther from the truth as Jack is an extremely likeable character.  He does not feed on humans, preferring cattle at the stockyards with occasional horse blood for treat, he has a girlfriend, and he even sends money home to his parents.  Jack is the sort of supernatural creature you would actually LIKE to have as a friend.<br />Set in Chicago towards the end of the Depression when Capone is in jail but crime lords still rule the city, The Vampire Files is a truly wonderful new genre:  hardboiled vampire detective fiction.  In the style of great detective stories like \\"Maltese Falcon\\", there are a lot verbal jabs and wisecracks in addition to sudden plot twists that keep you guessing.  The characters are sometimes a little stylized, like film-noir-- Jack's girlfriend is a nightclub singer who used to perform in a gig called The Nightcrawler, and there's of course the big bruiser of a hitman with nerves like taught piano wire-- but this adds to the drama and flavor of the book and makes it more period and believable.<br />The writing is excellent and the plot clips along at a fast pace that immediately draws in the reader.  The story is fun and unusual with a vampire-cum-investigator as its main character, so even if you're not into vamp novels, you are easily drawn in.  This is a series of books, and it's best to begin with #1, \\"Bloodlist\\" and work your way through the books.  You COULD start here with #2, \\"Lifeblood\\", but you'd be missing out on a lot of history, characters and insight into Jack himself.  Ms. Elrod doesn't spend much time rehashing what has happened before, so someone new to the series picking it up halfway through won't get all the subtle references.<br />All in all, I really enjoy this series and highly recommend it!!used to perform in a gig called The Nightcrawler, and there's of course the big bruiser of a hitman with nerves like taught piano wire-- but this adds to the drama and flavor of the book and makes it more period and believable.  <br />The writing is excellent and the plot clips along at a fast pace that immediately draws in the reader.

Familiarity breeds... if not contempt, then the ability to ignore things.  These objects have become such common fixtures in our lives that we hardly even notice them (that is, until they break or stop working!!).  However, as common as they may be, there was a time not so terribly long ago when they didn't even exist at all.  \\"Toilets, Toasters &amp; Telephones\\" outlines the history and invention of some of these very common objects that we use ever day.<br />Beginning with a chapter on bathrooms and the invention of toilets, sinks and bathtubs, Ms. Rubin takes us through the who, when and where of these object's creation.  Yes, Virginia, there really was a John Crapper who developed a flushing toilet in 1872.  He went on to invent the tank for holding the water and was even promoted to being the royal plumber.  At one point he \\"installed more than thirty toilets in Sandringham Castle for Queen Victoria's son Edward, Prince of Wales.  A Book about Crapper was called *Flushed with Pride*\\".<br />Throughout the book Ms. Rubin discusses basic design and manufacture principals and history.  The toaster, for example, arose out of a need to make toast without a burning fire, and the first ones made by General Electric in 1909 were made of a wire-heating element on a porcelain base (the toaster needed to be unplugged or else the toast would burn).  At one point, toaster manufactures (and presumably other manufacturers of household objects) designed their product with \\"planned obsolescence\\" in mind.  This meant that they would revamp the design each year so that consumers would buy the newest, newfangled toaster and toss out the old one, even if it was working fine.  This would in turn make more money for the company.  I'm sure this is a practice still in operation today--\\"hey!  This thing broke!!  I guess I'd better go buy a NEW one!!\\"<br />Intended for younger audiences between 9-12, this is a combination history and social studies book.  A number of objects in the pages still exist, but not at all like their first generation prototypes:  phones and refrigerators have changed a LOT since their invention, and the chapter on typewriters may very well be the first exposure computer savvy children have to these machines (\\"where's the hard drive?\\" one of my students once asked me).<br />The text is well written and flows very logically from beginning to end.  There are some dryly funny moments, like the above-mentioned book, \\"Flushed with Pride\\" or early reports of people using the first shower.  Generally, though, this is a scholarly work for young children that not only tells about the history of these great inventions, but also encourages children to look at the common with new eyes.<br />The book is generously illustrated with photos of objects from the past, some of which are hardly recognizable next to their modern counterparts:  a clothes iron that required charcoal and a hand bellows, for example.  Some of the captions for the illustrations are a little thin on text, making the reader wish there was more explained just how this thing was supposed to work.  However, outside of museums of technology, children are not likely to encounter these ancient objects, so it's worth pouring over the photographs of common objects long gone.  For teachers, parents or students who wish to go above and beyond and read MORE about these objects and their inventors, there is an extensive bibliography at the back of the book.<br />Ms. Rubin has clearly done her homework and provided students and adults alike with a book that is both informative and entertaining.  Highly recommended!r audiences between 9-12, this is a combination history and social studies book.  A number of objects in the pages still exist, but not at all like their first generation prototypes:  phones and refrigerators have changed a LOT since their invention, and the chapter on typewriters may very well be the first exposure computer savvy children have to these machines (\\"where's the hard drive?\\" one of my students once asked me).  <br />The text is well written and flows very logically from beginning to end.  There are some dryly funny moments, like the above-mentioned book, \\"Flushed with Pride\\" or early reports of people using the first shower.  Generally, though, this is a scholarly work for young children that not only tells about the history of these great inventions, but also encourages children to look at the common with new eyes.<br />The book is generously illustrated with photos of objects from the past, some of which are hardly recognizable next to their modern counterparts:  a clothes iron that required charcoal and a hand bellows, for example.  Some of the captions for the illustrations are a little thin on text, making the reader wish there was more explained just how this thing was supposed to work.  However, outside of museums of technology, children are not likely to encounter these ancient objects, so it's worth pouring over the photographs of common objects long gone.  For teachers, parents or students who wish to go above and beyond and read MORE about these objects and their inventors, there is an extensive bibliography at the back of the book.  <br />Ms. Rubin has clearly done her homework and provided students and adults alike with a book that is both informative and entertaining.

They&#8217;ve read all the others in the series, like &#8220;Curse of the Mummy&#8217;s Breath&#8221; and &#8220;Zombie Substitute Teacher&#8221; and can&#8217;t wait for the next one to come out.<br />The day it&#8217;s due to arrive at the library, the gang is poised, having all but camped out overnight to be the first in line to check it out and read it.  You can imagine their surprise when they find out that it has been banned from the public library!  A group of concerned parents have decided that it&#8217;s not appropriate for children and to have had it removed!  What&#8217;s the gang to do?  Is there any way Arthur and his friends can get the book back so everyone can enjoy it?  A surprise ending is in store for the reader, making this a fun page-turner.<br />Marc Brown&#8217;s Arthur is one of the best-known characters in children&#8217;s literature today.  He&#8217;s seen on television, has large format picture books and also the Arthur Adventure series, of which this title is #2.  Intended for intermediate, independent readers who have graduated to short chapter books, the Arthur books are easy to read, a lot of fun, and encourage readers to think about their world and the different issues of friendship, family or in the case of &#8220;Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club&#8221;, censorship....<br />I have used &#8220;Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club&#8221; in my own classroom many times and found that it&#8217;s a great way to stimulate conversation and thinking among my students (one cryptically hinted that maybe we should ban THIS book as well!!).  My point in using it as a social studies tool isn&#8217;t to agree or disagree with students so much as it is to get them to THINK&#8212;- &#8220;tell me your feelings about censorship, but back it up with reasoning and research&#8221; is how I address the issue.  This in turn allows the student not only to voice their own opinion, but to examine their feelings and opinions as well; too many times in our culture we allow other folks to do our thinking for us.<br />Mr. Brown has done an excellent job of taking a very complicated issue in our society and presenting it to young readers in an understandable and intelligent way.  I appreciate and applaud authors who not only aim to entertain their readers, but encourage them to think about themselves and their world.  Hats off, Mr. Brown!!

When William went to the dentist for a filling, he had no idea that it would be able to pick up radio broadcasts!!  Wow!  A radio tooth!  You can imagine the fun tricks William could play on his family, friends and teacher with a radio in his tooth (sorry, you&#8217;ll have to read the book to find out what those tricks ARE!)<br />However, one day, when William tries to use a chain link fence as an antenna, he gets a shock which &#8220;changes the channel&#8221; on his radio tooth, and he discovers that he can tune in radio transmissions from space!!  Soon, he&#8217;s abducted by large men in bad suits and terrible ties who plan to invade earth!!  What&#8217;s a boy to do??<br />Mr. Pinkwater has been a very popular children&#8217;s author with many of his books from the 1970&#8217;s still in print today.  One of my childhood favorites was &#8220;The Big Orange Splot&#8221;.  While other authors from that time period have had their books slowly fade away, Mr. Pinkwater&#8217;s are still around and attracting new readers.  Perhaps one of the main reasons is because his books are genuinely funny and witty.  There&#8217;s plenty of silly humor for the young, beginning reader, and also plenty of subtle plays on words that will amuse the more advanced reader (or the parent reading with their child!!).<br />Generally I love Mr. Pinkwater&#8217;s stories, but &#8220;Fat Men from Space&#8221; isn&#8217;t one of his best.  It starts off fine and laugh-out-loud funny, but about halfway through the book the plot goes into high gear and the reader starts to feel a bit gypped:  events that you would assume would take a few days to happen are over and done with in about 3 or 4 paragraphs.  Descriptions loose their tangy zingers of absurdity and it feels like Mr. Pinkwater was in a rush to finish the book before a deadline or something.  The ending is also a bit weak, making the book feel like it was left open-ended for a sequel that never came.<br />If you&#8217;re a diehard Pinkwater fan, then read the book by all means!!  If you have a beginning-to-intermediate reader who is looking for an easy-to-read book that will keep &#8216;em laughing, this is a good choice.  The language is easy to read and the pace is fast enough that even a beginning reader can probably finish it in one or two sittings.  This will encourage them to read more and show that reading doesn&#8217;t have to be dry and booooring.<br />However, for the more intermediate to advanced reader, &#8220;Fat Men&#8230;&#8221; may be disappointing *because* of it&#8217;s fast pace.  For them, I would recommend &#8220;Lizard Music&#8221; by Mr. Pinkwater.<br />Not bad, still a lot of fun, but I would have expected just a bit more from Mr. P.nkwater fan, then read the book by all means!!

David's mysterious girlfriend, Senna, seemed to have drawn the four of them together at the lakeside right before the world split apart and swallowed Senna up.  The four others managed to somehow get caught in her wake and were swept up with her.  They were transported to a mysterious universe called Everworld where ancient gods warred with human armies.  Everworld is a dangerous and strange place to be, even for savvy, modern kids.<br />In the second book, \\"Land of Loss\\", K.A. Applegate picks up where she left off in the first book-- in the heat of a bloody battle between Vikings and an ancient South American Aztec civilization where ritual human sacrifice is the norm.  Entering Everworld is as severe and gripping for the reader as it is for the teens who were mysteriously swept away.  Exploring Everworld is a dangerous prospect for suburban teens used to cars, malls, refrigerators, and the Internet.  They encounter strange creatures that have also been swept out of their own universe and have been abandon in Everworld.  The possibility of ever returning to what is commonly referred to as \\"reality\\" seems to be slowly slipping away.<br />Classified as young adult novels, the Everworld series is by K.A. Applegate who brought us the very popular \\"Animorphs\\" series.  She has very believably constructed this strange, fascinating and very dangerous world of Everworld without once loosing the reader-- no mean feat when four modern teens have joined forces with ancient Vikings and gone to war against an equally ancient Aztec deity that demands human sacrifice.  What makes it so believable are her characters who are delightfully real:  the adventuresome, warrior wanna-be David narrates the first book while the class clown and all-around joker Christopher narrates this one.  By rotating us through the characters, Applegate allows the reader to delve deeper into each one's head and emotions.  We find what drives them, how they're different, how they're alike.<br />Like any band of teens suddenly thrown together here or there (or waaaay out there in Everworld), fights erupt over almost meaningless little issues, fear and adrenaline run like faucets and arguments erupt.  Applegate doesn't shy away from any of this, and that is what makes her books so powerful.  When faced with the prospect of having your heart cut out by a filthy, blood-encrusted, mad Aztec priest in some sort of topsy-turvy parallel universe, \\"fear\\" hardly even comes close to describing what you would feel.  Applegate, however, shows us very clearly what we would feel, but without going overboard into what has been called \\"splatterpunk\\"-- rivers of blood and gore-- which would ruin the effect.  Far from being wordy and overly descriptive, she tells the tale with plenty left to the imagination.<br />Yes, wars are waged, people die, blood is shed and spooky, potentially dangerous creatures and people lurk in every shadow of Everworld.  It is therefore not a book I would recommend for squeamish or very young readers.  However, it is a very well written, engaging and readable series that easily straddles the genres of horror, fantasy, adventure and science fiction (with a healthy dose of surrealism thrown in for good measure).  It's also engaging enough to hook in even reluctant readers who don't normally read for pleasure.  I've used these books in a book club that I lead in the school I teach at, and not only have I had students beg to go on to the rest of the books in the series (currently there are 12), I've also managed to attract a fair number of students who would normally not pick up a book at all if they didn't absolutely have to.  This, if nothing else, speaks to the power of the series and Ms. Applegate's ability to draw in readers.  Highly recommended!!der to delve deeper into each one's head and emotions.

At the beginning of our story, Mr. Flemming has just woken up to find out a number of interesting things about himself.  First off, he's dead.  Actually, to be more precise, he's UNdead:  apparently the woman he had been dating who said she was a vampire wasn't kidding!!  Jack Flemming is now a member of the Creatures of the Night Club, with all the rights and responsibilities that entails.<br />Having had an idea that something like this just might happen to him (there is no guarantee that being bitten by a vampire would transform you into one), Jack is surprisingly cool about his new transition.  What is bothering him more is WHY is he dead in the first place, and what is he doing in Chicago?  Some nasty-looking bullet holes are rapidly healing on his chest, which gives him the sinking suspicion he didn't die from food poisoning.  Unfortunately, dying has affected his memory and he can't remember why he's dead or what he's supposed to be doing in Chicago.  Still, as the jacket says, &quot;there are definite advantages to being a vampire.  For starters, you can track down your own murderer.&quot;<br />A good deal of \\"Bloodlist\\" involves Jack getting familiar with his new body and all the new restrictions and expansions on his new \\"life\\" (no pun intended).  He is, of course, suddenly restricted to a liquid diet and daylight hours are right out.  On the other hand, he has gained tremendous strength, agility, heightened senses and a handy ability to disappear at will (a skill he uses to hilarious effect in his efforts to track down his own killer and determine why he was bumped off).<br />Ms. Elrod has created a very likable fellow in a heretofore-unexplored genre:  hardboiled vampire detective.  In the tradition of such classics as \\"The Maltese Falcon\\", Flemming explores the underbelly of Chicago in the years after Capone was imprisoned, but the crime bosses still ran the city.  It's got that gritty, seedy flavor to it that detective and mystery aficionados will love, and with the introduction of a main character that is a vampire, the book takes the reader into a new and exciting direction.<br />Flemming himself is a fine fellow and unlike the bloodthirsty, virgin-enchanting monsters of most vamp stories who would just as soon rip your heart out as say hello.  Unlike most other vamp stories where the vampires have a seething contempt of humankind, Flemming tries to keep his humanity about him as much as possible and put his new talents to good use by avenging his own death.  He visits the stockyards to feed and even sends money to his mother in rural New York.  He is, in short, the sort of guy you'd actually like to have as a friend, though he won't be much fun as a dinner date.<br />This is the first in Vampire Files series, and though you don't need to read them in order, you'll find that you WANT to because they're so good.  I myself am not into vamp or Goth culture, but I do very much enjoy a good read.  If you're looking for ancient, power-mad monsters who mercilessly feast on the living blood of the innocent, you'll probably be disappointed.  If you're looking for a new detective story with a talented man still grappling with issues of his humanity (all the while trading wisecracks and one-liners with himself and other characters) and his search for the guilty, you've found it right here.

School goes well, home life is OK.  There's nothing in his life you could call odd or strange.  Well, except for his enigmatic girlfriend, Senna.  Unlike her half-sister April who is open and bubbly, Senna is the sort of girl you could know for a thousand years and still not quite understand.  There's a mystery about her that David can't penetrate.<br />That mystery of just who Senna really is explodes very soon into the book when David is mysteriously drawn to the lakeside to find Senna sitting alone on a rock.  More mysterious is why his friends Christopher, Jamill and April are drawn there as well.  There's no time to think about the situation, however, because without warning reality slips its gears and Senna is swallowed up by the earth.<br />Senna disappears and the gang finds themselves in a bizarre alter universe called Everworld.  It's a dangerous world populated by Vikings and ancient gods, and our heroes find themselves smack dab in the middle of a massive conflict they don't understand and can hardly imagine.  Teetering somewhere between dream and madness, the teens must survive, seek out Senna, and manage to return home from Everworld.  Somehow...<br />\\"Search for Senna\\" is the first in the Everworld series by K.A. Applegate, the prolific author who gave us the immensely popular \\"Animorphs\\" series. Intended for young adult readers in Jr. High School and above (though I know more than a few adults who enjoy these books), the series is a quick moving and fast paced.  The first book will have readers asking more questions than it answers of course, not the least of which will be what exactly IS Everworld?  Having finished with the book, I could give you some hints, but you would find it so much more satisfying to read the book yourself!<br />Told from the first person perspective of David, Everworld's characters are deeply believable and inherently different.  We can almost smell the fear and sense the confusion of the characters as they fight to survive in this new world so very much like our own, but yet so nightmarish.  This may make the book frightening to younger readers but will likely immediately draw in older-yet-reluctant readers who find reading dull.  Indeed, I've used \\"Search for Senna\\" with the book club at the school I teach at, and found that it attracted students who normally do not read for pleasure at all.  The language is easy, the characters are believable, the plot is fast moving.  We finished with the book within a week (no mean feat for some of my readers!) and the club has been all but begging to go to the second and third books (as of this writing, the series is 12 books long).<br />If you like fantastic tales, if you like being swept up in a whirlwind of a story that grabs you and doesn't let go (not even at the end of the book!), then the Everworld series is the perfect choice.

The moment I saw &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, I knew there was something different about this book than the others in the series.  First off, I noticed it's size:  over 700 pages in hardback (12 cassettes in audio).  Second, the dark reds and purples of the other three jacket covers were replaced with greens and jades.  Clearly, this book would be different than the first three in the series.<br />&quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; IS different, though the same cast of characters still find themselves at Hogwarts for Harry's 4th year of magical education.  Ron, Herminone, Harry, Fred, George and the lot are all back for yet more adventures in the wizarding world.  The book begins with the Quiddich World Cup taking place on a &quot;nice, abandon moor&quot; in England between the opposing teams of Bulgaria and Ireland.  Harry, who plays Seeker for the Griffindor team, is awestruck by seeing the best of the best professional Quiddich teams play, and it's clear that he intends to try to make himself the best player possible.  However, the best laid plans oft go awry, and Quiddich is unexpectedly cancelled for the school year due to another upcoming tournament.<br />To say any more about the plot would be to tell too much about this fantastic, fast-paced story where the plot twists fly as quick and twisted as the path of the zooming golden snitch.  True to form, Rowling keeps her readers guessing as to what could possibly happen next, and when you think you've got it all<br />figured out, the story-- rather like life itself--changes dramatically on you.<br />Rowling also introduces a bevy of new and delightful characters, including a house elf who is scared of heights, a Bulgarian Quiddich Seeker who is perhaps most famous for his glowering, grim expression, and an evil wizard catcher with a wooden leg and enchanted, wandering eye.  Hagrid is back teaching classes again, this time with a whole new lot of strange and semi-dangerous creatures, including some called Blast-Ended Skroots.<br />I listened to the book on audio, read by Mr. Jim Dale, who is a masterful reader.  Using a potpourri of different voices for each character, major or minor, he brings the book to vivid life in the ear and mind of the reader.  From the greasy, sly voice of Snape the potions master threatening Harry, to the amusing voice of Professor Sprout the herbology professor waxing eloquent about bubo tuber pus, Mr. Dale never once confused his voices or lost my interest for a second.<br />I have done some semi-professional reading myself for the blind and print handicapped, and I know how grueling it can be to be constantly reading aloud, hour after hour, into a microphone in a cramped, often stuffy recording booth.  Mr. Dale, however, sounds as if he's sitting next to you in the Griffindor common room by the fire on a long, quiet evening.  His telling of the story is masterful and engaging, never missing a beat.  My hat is off to such a fine performance, and I hope and trust that he will lend his talents to the NEXT Potter book, and the next and the next...<br />Finally, let me echo the opinions of some other reviewers that &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; is much darker and scarier than the previous three in the series.  The ending of the book is somewhat bloody and terrifying, which could prove to be too much for very young readers, say under 10 years of age.  The book is much heavier on dialogue and description, and contains far more subplots than any other Potter book, though these subplots have a way of combining and intermixing with each other in the must surprising of ways.  If you have a young Potter fan in your family, I would encourage you to read/listen to &quot;Goblet&quot; YOURSELF first before giving it as a present:  you want to evaluate how appropriate it would be as a gift.  It's a masterful story and jolly brilliant, but it might prove to be too frightening for young audiences.  If so, it's best to shelf the book until the recipient is perhaps a bit older.<br />I read a lot of young adult books, far more than I have reviewed, and this series rivals that of the Earthsea saga by LeGuin.  It is masterful storytelling and certainly deserving of its praise and reputation.  I personally would recommend hearing it read by Mr. Dale, but whether you read or listen to this book, you should definitely experience it.  There is really nothing like it being published today.  Thank you, Ms. Rowling, thank you Mr. Dale, for such a wonderful work!!.<br />I read a lot of young adult books, far more than I have reviewed, and this series rivals that of the Earthsea saga by LeGuin.

Theodore Seuss Guisel is, of course, one of the best known children's authors today.  Though he left us in 1994, his legacy lives on and his books are still produced, bought and loved as much now as anytime in the past.  When we think of him, we immediately think of &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; or &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;, but we can easily forget some of his wonderful, lesser-known works. &quot;When I was quite young and quite small for my size I met an old man in the Desert of Drize...&quot; So begins &quot;Did I Ever Tell You...&quot; where the narrator finds an old man sitting atop a prickly cactus in the middle of the desert.  The man tells the boy narrator that whenever HE feels like his life isn't going well, he reminds himself how lucky he really IS.  He could be, for example, a construction worker on the impossibly rickety Bunglebung Bridge, where workers are toiling over the water to finish the impossibly crooked structure.  Yes, things could be far worse!!  You could be a Poogle-Horn Player who has to honk away on your complex, tuba-like Poogle-Horn while descending a flight of stairs... on a two story unicycle, no less!!  The absurdness of people less fortunate splash across each page, Seuss-like, as Mr. Bix wakes up at 6 in the morning to find that his Borfin has schlumpped over, or Mr. Potter who has to dot i's and cross t's on endless, miles-long spools of paper!  Yes, things could be far worse than they are, Ducky, so count yourself lucky! Published in 1973, &quot;Have I Ever Told You...&quot; is a wonderfully funny book with some subtle messages.  Written during a period of time when parents were still forever admonishing their children, &quot;you're so lucky to be able to eat those Brussels sprouts!!  Why, there's children starving in Africa...&quot; the book can be seen as a lesson in morality and thankfulness OR as satire of those very parents who encourage children to think of those less fortunate than them when they crank about life's inequities. Satire or morality play, &quot;Have I Ever Told You...&quot; is classical Seuss at his best.  The illustrations are properly absurd and colorful, splashing across the page in Seuss's perennial style.  There's humans assembling bridges as well as odd creatures getting stuck in 4-way traffic jams.  The illustrations are uncluttered and the text is easy to read, making it an excellent choice for beginning to intermediate readers.

The illustrations are uncluttered and the text is easy to read, making it an excellent choice for beginning to intermediate readers.  A wonderfully fun book, and highly recommended!!	2001-05-24

(Aladdin Books)	Books	5	17	17	N	N	simple childhood favorite	A small grey mouse with enormous ears is asked by the narrator who he belongs to.  Why, he's nobody's mouse!!  Where's his mother?  Inside the cat!!  Where's his father??  Inside a trap!!  What about his sister?? She's lost, far, far away...  My goodness!!  Well, what is he going to DO about it, then??  I'll let you read to find out his fun, creative answers to his life's problems!<br />Originally published in 1970, \\"Whose Mouse are You?\\" is as much fun for young children and beginning readers now as it was back then.  The text is short and simple, it rhymes and repeats, so even very young children can get interested in the story and repeat it after a few tellings.  The illustrations are wonderfully simple and uncluttered, drawn with only with black yellow and red (from which we can get pink, orange and grey, too!)<br />When I was a infant/toddler teacher in daycare, \\"Whose Mouse are You?\\" was one of the all time favorites.  Children just learning how to speak would call out \\"mouse book!!  Mouse book!\\" and then sit glued to the pages.  I've even seen an elementary school art teacher use this book to show how one does NOT need a box of 2 bazillion crayons to make interesting and fun illustrations-\\"get creative with limited tools\\" she said, passing out only red, yellow and black markers to the class.<br />For lapsitting readers as well as beginning readers, \\"Whose Mouse...\\" is an excellent choice and a lot of fun!!  Enjoy!!	2001-05-24

For many young children, the loss of a pet is their first exposure to death and grieving, so stories about what they&#8217;re going through are a helpful way of healing into that loss.  Jack&#8217;s family has a ceremony when they bury his ashes and they always try to remember the good things about Jack.  They allow themselves to feel what they feel, whether it be sadness or happy memories about times past.  They may go on and get another dog sometime, but for right now, they&#8217;re not ready.<br />This is a beautifully written and illustrated book with soft watercolors and an easily flowing story that is a genuine pleasure to read.  While it doesn&#8217;t address existential questions like &#8220;what happens to us after we die?&#8221;, it does explain the grieving process from a child&#8217;s perspective and encourages families to talk about their loss as a way of healing.  The final page, written by Ms. Kathleen Dunn, chief social worker for the Vetinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, helps adults understand the grieving process in children and explains some of the things they may be looking for.<br />Even if you haven&#8217;t had the recent loss of a pet in your life, &#8220;A Dog Like Jack&#8221; is definitely worth reading and adding to your collection.  Thank you, Ms. Disalvo-Ryan, for this wonderful work and the opportunity, however brief, to meet a beautiful dog like Jack.	2001-05-24

The date may have past, but \\"June 29, 1999\\" remains a wonderful children's classic!!  About a month before the day of the book's title, Young Holly Evans began a special science project.  Using weather balloons, she had launched a number of different plants and vegetables in flat boxes into the ionosphere to study their growth.  However, on June 29th, a most mysterious event occurred...  GIGANTIC vegetables descended from the sky all over the country!!  A hiker in the Rocky Mountains discovers turnips the size of houses and \\"cucumbers circle Kalamazoo\\".<br />As they slowly float to the ground (well, the red peppers need some help for some unknown reason), news reports come in from all over the country:  gigantic parsnips in Providence, lima beans in Levittown, and arugula in Ashtabula.  Wait a second!!  Holly is puzzled; she didn't USE arugula as part of her experiment!!  What's going on here??  If the arugula, the eggplants and the avocados are NOT part of her experiment, where did they come from??<br />David Weisner is the author of the Caldecott winning book, \\"Tuesday\\" in which frogs on their lily pads suddenly take flight one summer night.  His delightful sense of the strange is continued here in \\"June 29\\".  Like all of his books, the illustrations are lush and meticulously detailed, the reader feels like they could easily walk right into the pictures and be part of the action.  The story is short, easy to read, and uses a lot of alliteration, so it can easily graft itself into a language arts lesson.<br />The story has some wonderfully fun visual jokes that older readers and adults will find fun, for example giant gourds being used as housing in North Carolina and The Big Apple being renamed to The Big Rutabaga (a giant purple rutabaga parades down the streets of New York to a blizzard of ticker tape and streamers).  The book does have a wonderful surprise ending that I shall not give away here but will delight readers on the last page or two.  If you're a fan of \\"Tuesday\\" or merely love an unusual story, you must pick up a copy of \\"June 29, 1999\\"!!an of \\"Tuesday\\" or merely love an unusual story, you must pick up a copy of \\"June 29, 1999\\"!!	2001-05-24

On a beautiful night in the city, a young girl runs up the street with her mother.  \\"It's twilight!\\" she exclaims to the man in the bakery, to the couples in love holding hands.  She is the keeper of twilight, and it's her job to transition the day into the night.<br />\\"'I'm in charge of the twilight here and there and everywhere' the little girl keeper announced.\\"  Then, in a marvelous, dream-like sequence, she floats high above the city to polish the stars, read the sun a bedtime story and caution the creatures of the night that it's not QUITE time to wake up and begin their day, they need to wait for full night.  She flies through the darkening skies, between the tall buildings with pelicans coming home to the bay to eat.  She persuades the moon to rise, peeking up over the horizon and casting long shadows across the Statue of Liberty in the harbor.<br />\\"Twilight\\" is a beautiful, dreamy book, masterfully constructed in both text and illustration.  The story is soft and almost mysterious--the little girl is never named, so she could be any child with an active imagination and a love of twilight.  The illustrations are full page and very detailed in watercolors and pen &amp; ink.  The colors are muted evening shades of purple and oranges, perfectly showing the encroaching night as day fades away on the city.  Though the city is crowded (what city isn't?) there is a coziness and sleepiness to the story as everything slowly winds down for the night in the city.<br />The story is easy to read and certainly sparks the imagination of the reader.  The story is easy enough that a beginning reader can tackle it, and it's engaging and timeless that far more advanced readers (like, say, some ADULTS!) will love to revisit this story over and over again... Especially right before bedtime!!	2001-05-23

Whiteblack the penguin hosts a radio program for everyone in Penguinland.  He's the resident storyteller and is well liked and admired because of his marvelous stories.  However, eventually he runs out of stories to tell!!  Thinking that an adventure would give him new ideas, he and his friends construct a boat, give him some rope, and send him on his way to adventure. What adventures he has!  His boat is struck by an iceberg, he hitches a ride on a Navy warship, manages to get shot from one of it's cannons, helps baby ostriches to hatch and even crosses the desert on a roller skate!  Whiteblack is delightfully cheery at every turn, changing what otherwise might be a total disaster into yet another tale for his radio show.  &quot;Besides,&quot; he says as his boat sinks down out of sight, &quot;I've always wanted to be in an accident!&quot;  Talk about the power of positive thinking!! The Rey's are, of course, most famous for their creation of the Curious George books.  This work was originally written in 1937 when Mr. Hans Rey was working at a Paris World Fair booth across from a penguin exhibit.  Somehow, though, it never made publication and was merely mothballed in a trunk before the Rey's left Paris.  Discovered 63 years later and published in the year 2000, Whiteblack is immediately identifiable as a work of the Rey's.  The yellows of the book are the exact same as those we're used to in the Curious George series.  The same thick outlines and comfortable, fun illustrations are here as well, including what looks very much like a cameo appearance by the Man in the Yellow Hat!!  The book concludes with a brief history of the Rey's and the fortuitous discovery of the long-forgotten Whiteblack manuscript. The book is wonderful fun in both it's text and illustrations.  The crazy adventures Whiteblack gets himself into and his cheerful outlook on life (&quot;besides, I've always wanted to fly&quot; he says to himself after being shot out of the Navy cannon) will delight children of all ages.  Whether you're a fan of Curious George or merely love fun children's stories, &quot;Whiteblack the Penguin...&quot; is an excellent story and a definite to add to your collection!!ght children of all ages.

He will perform amazing feats of hypnotism right here live on our stage!!  Oh, yes, let me also introduce to you his dog, Rollo Bones, the canine hypnotist...<br />In this funny, brightly illustrated story, The Amazing Brain (T.A.B., for short) and his brown dog, Rollo Bones, tour the country doing amazing feats of hypnotism.  When a woman with tall, bright red hair stares deep into Rollo's eyes, TAB tells her to act like a chicken!!  She does, scratching around the stage, clucking to herself and even pecking at bits of thrown popcorn.  What a feat!!  They perform even for the crowned heads of Europe.<br />While success seems to be going to Brain's head (no pun intended), Rollo is getting tired of the ceaseless traveling, the constant barrage to do this, don't do that, and he misses the good old days when the Brain and he would just go outside and play, or relax.  One day, deciding he'd had enough, Rollo runs away.<br />It doesn't take readers long to grasp that Rollo is the real star of the show, and without him, The Amazing Brain isn't so amazing anymore.  After a time, Rollo gets tired of being alone and creeping about in disguise, because Brain has put out an alert for him.  The ending has a wonderful reunion, of course, but also a subtle, mischievous little surprise.<br />I love \\"Rollo Bones\\" and press it on friends and family with young children whenever I can, especially if they have dogs!  The illustrations are bright, bold and oversized and look to be drawn with either oil pastels or crayon.  This gives the illustrations a child-like quality that is fun for young readers.  The text of the story is easy to read and uncomplicated.  It flows easily from beginning to end and fits the illustrations perfectly.  This is a great choice for young children or beginning readers, say, age 5 and up (any younger and they might not be able to grasp the meaning of \\"hypnotism\\").<br />Perfect for the dog lover as well, \\"Rollo Bones\\" is a wonderful book with a zippy story and fun ending.

A young boy rides with his class field trip to the Empire State Building on a cold, winter's day.  Along the way, he draws elaborate pictures of animals on the fog on the windows.  It's foggy on the observation platform, too; so foggy and cloudy in fact that he can't see anything.  Imagine his surprise when a passing cloud takes off his scarf and hat! The boy is then invited on a journey with the cloud, and is swept off through the sky towards a large, submarine-like flying machine.  It looks like something out of Jules Verne hovering there, with large funnels like curved smokestacks on it.  There is a large clock showing the seasons of the year and a huge sign reading SECTOR 7.  Going through one of the funnels, the boy and the cloud find themselves in a large room not unlike Grand Central Station, with people announcing arrivals and departures of different types of clouds.  There are people in an office wearing sleeve garters and old style eye visors passing out blueprints to the clouds, showing their new formations. Well, the boy is a fine artist, after all, and he whips up a few blueprints of his own!!  The clouds transform into fantastical geometric and detailed animal shapes.  Needless to say, the engineers in charge are not pleased to see this, and though they press their own blueprints on the clouds, what happens outside of the flying sub is really up to the clouds themselves. &quot;Sector 7&quot; is by the same author who brought us the award winning book, &quot;Tuesday.&quot;  Similar to that work, &quot;Sector 7&quot; is a story told entirely without words.  The artwork is detailed and lush, and one could easily pour over the drawings time and time again and notice something new that you had never noticed before.  Indeed, &quot;Sector 7&quot; makes more and more sense the more you read it, mostly because each time you open the book you DO notice something else.  Since the story is told without words and is a just a tad surreal, very young readers may not get as much out of it as their older peers.  Children who have active imaginations, however, could easily get behind this story, and I can imagine them looking at the illustrations for hours, imagining their own flying submarines in the sky. I've used this book in writing classes before, encouraging students to compose their own text to this story, and have usually gotten very creative, good results!!  Art teachers could use this book as well as an example of realistic detail in their work. I personally love &quot;Sector 7&quot; and press it on as many readers as I possibly can.  Adults generally seem to love it as much as children, which is perhaps one of the highest compliments that can be paid for any book:  universal interest and appreciation.  If you know and love &quot;Tuesday&quot; or have never even heard of Mr. Wiesner, I strongly urge you to get your hands on this wonderful book!!get as much out of it as their older peers.

Medusa was a very beautiful Greek woman who was proud of her hair.  She combed it lovingly each day and thought it her most beautiful feature.  However, being foolish as well as beautiful, she one day made the mistake of saying that her hair was even more beautiful than Athena.  \\"That,\\" reads the story, \\"was a big mistake.\\"<br />The rest is, as they say, history.  Athena, in a fit of rage, turns Medusa's hair into a nest of writhing, wriggling snakes.  Medusa's skin turns green and scaly.  She is so horrifying, that as she flees into the forest, animals turn to stone.<br />Years pass and young Perseus decides to go forth and kill Medusa.  The king is pleased with Perseus, not because Medusa will no longer be a threat, but because the king secretly does not like Perseus-- \\"he wanted Perseus to fail.  He hoped Perseus would die.\\"<br />Outfitted with a shiny shield and flying sandals by other gods, Perseus seeks out and does manage to kill Medusa.  On his way home, he finds the beautiful Andromeda chained to a rock as a giant sea monster approaches.  Perseus rescues the young, beautiful woman, and returns home to the king.<br />The story of Medusa is as old as civilization itself.  Ms. Spinner has made the story very accessible to young readers in grade 1-3, and the illustrations by Ms. Swan are detailed and astonishing.  Each picture is a photograph of 3-dimensional cut paper collages which are sometimes very complicated, like the tangled mess of snakes on Medusa's head.  The collages clearly must have taken hours to cut and assemble, making this a beautiful work of art as well as a good story for beginning readers.<br />The text by Ms. Spinner is short but not choppy.  It flows well from beginning to end without being confusing, which will help children who are just learning to read.  The subject is a good one-- a hideous creature turning people to stone just by looking at them!  It certainly will hold a child's interest!  Ms. Spinner has also included pronunciation guides to the Greek names, which will not only aid in decoding, but will help reinforce breaking words into syllables.<br />Though short and intended for beginning readers, this is a wonderful book and clearly the author and illustrator took their time and intended it to be a story that will be read over and over again.  As a teacher, I would recommend this story to be including in a beginning basal reader, or multiple copies used for group reading.  Art teachers could easily use this book as well to discuss 3-D rendering and collages for all grade levels.<br />Masterfully executed, a highly recommended book!!guides to the Greek names, which will not only aid in decoding, but will help reinforce breaking words into syllables.  <br />Though short and intended for beginning readers, this is a wonderful book and clearly the author and illustrator took their time and intended it to be a story that will be read over and over again.

Rhymes are catchy things, and therefore a wonderful way to teach children just about anything.  In &quot;One, Two...&quot; Ms. Arenson has taken some of the more well known number rhymes and combined them with her bright, beautiful and bold illustrations.<br />Children dance, swim and skip rope through the pages along with different animals, like the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 bees that come out of their hive.  Some rhymes are very short, only 4 or 5 lines long, while others are much longer and take a page or two.  Some are repetitive, like &quot;5 green and speckled frogs/sitting on a speckled log...&quot; which help children understand numbers by working up or down one number at a time.  All of the rhymes have a wonderful song-like quality to them making them catch and fun to say or sing.  Quite a lot of them would be good choices for skipping rope.<br />The illustrations are bold and very colorful.  The book is also multicultural with children of different races and skin tones represented (this is a nice touch:  too often illustrators forget to represent their characters as anything other than white-- &quot;too many little white kids tripping merrily through the bluebells&quot; is how a colleague of mine criticizes many picture books; this easily passed by her as representing ALL children).<br />The story will hold the interest of most very young children, and because of the large type and simple illustrations, it's a fine choice for lapsitting.  Because the text is easy to read and often repetitive, it's also a great choice for beginning readers who are just learning to decode the written word.  Lots of fun and very much recommended!	2001-05-21

The story of Harry Potter is fast becoming one of the best-known stories in children's or young adult literature.  The stories have caught on like wildfire and Harry's now famous face-- complete with lightning bolt scar and thick, black rimmed glasses with tape-adorn everything from figurines to bookmarks, coffee mugs to tee shirts.  It has become a marketing phenomenon unlike anything else seen before.<br />The REASON for the popularity for Harry and his friends is because the book is excellent.  Lousy book characters may make an appearance on the side of the Taco Bell large soda cups, but their time in the limelight is short lived, indeed.  Harry Potter is different.  In a way that few other books have done, Potter is able to cross the boundaries of age, class, race and gender and be immediately likable to almost everyone who picks the book up.  As a school librarian and reading teacher, I have drawn in even the most reluctant readers into reading through the Potter books.  I have even had students as young as third grade attacking \\"Goblet of Fire\\" with absolute gusto--a book that is roughly the thickness of a telephone directory, weighing in at 734 pages in hardback.<br />The reason, of course, is because the books are GOOD, each one getting progressively better and a bit more complicated than the last.  Ms. Rowling is able to weave minor and major plot twists around and through the main plot of the story with the skill of a master storyteller.  This is not easy to do without loosing the reader when the target age for Potter books is usually less than 15 years of age.  Perhaps it is BECAUSE of some of these subplots that readers are especially drawn in-- they always somehow merge into one another in wonderful and unexpected ways.  If there ever were books that you kept reading just to find out what would happen next, these would be the ones.<br />With over 3,000 reviews as of this writing, there's little else I can add that hasn't been said before.  Harry Potter is a young boy living with his aunt and uncle, the Dersley's, who are perhaps the WORST characters in modern children's literature since Roald Dahl's \\"The Twits\\".  Harry's aunt and uncle shower affection on their own son, Dudley (who is best described in later works as \\"a great blithering git\\"), while ignoring Harry as much as humanly possible.

The Halloween Tarot Submitted 5/17/01<br />Halloween whimsy all through the year! Just like Ms. West, the creator of the Halloween tarot, I LOVE Halloween.  My birthday is in October, I love dressing up in costumes, one of my favorite movies is \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\", and I even got MARRIED on Halloween!  (Hey, if you're gonna do something scary, might as well do it on the scariest nite of the year!!)  So, when I found Ms. West's deck, of course I had to get it; do not pass Go, do not collect $200.<br />The cards are very well drawn with crisp lines and clear, bright colors.  Not surprisingly, black and orange are main colors of this deck, though white, blue and red are prominently featured as well.  The figures of the tarot are drawn from a number of different Halloweenish sources:  costumed trick-or-treaters, movie monsters, scarecrows, and the European vegetable people of a century ago.  The Empress, for example, is the Bride of Frankenstein, the Hermit, a mad scientist brewing up strange concoctions.  Temperance is a young witch pouring potions and the Fool is a gleeful clown in motley.  None of these images are frightening or spooky, so the overall effect is more of childhood play than of Halloween terror.  In this respect, I think this makes the deck more open and playful to the querent than other more gothic or \\"serious\\" decks.<br />The symbolism of the cards in both Major and Minor Arcana is very similar to that of one of the most well known decks, the Rider-Waite.  This makes it a good choice for the beginning-to-intermediate reader who is just learning all the symbols of the deck.  The Minor Arcana have had their suits changed a bit to suit the holiday, pumpkins represent pentacles, bats represent swords, ghosts represent cups and imps (small, red devil creatures) represent wands in the more traditional decks.  Still, even with these changes the symbols are very clear and easy to read.  What's more, each card of both the Major and Minor Arcana have a black cat on it; he acts as a sort of touchstone or common thread through the deck that ties everything together very nicely.<br />I always recommend that the absolute beginner start with the Rider-Waite, simply because it's one of the most well known decks and most books about the tarot use the Rider to illustrate the cards.  However, even as a beginner, I found myself able to use the Halloween tarot just as easily (if not MORE easily in my case--the Rider sometimes seems too serious for my blood) as any other deck.  I've also found that people who are leery around tarot cards loosen up when they see these fun, playful cards:  it seems more like a childhood game than a heavy-duty inquiry, and that allows them to relax a bit and let the reading resonate with them more than they might have otherwise allowed themselves to.<br />You don't have to be a nut over Halloween and collect pumpkins, skeletons and black cats like Ms. West (or me!) to enjoy these cards, nor do you have to wait until October to use them.  They're great icebreakers at parties (Halloween or not!) and for people with a playful, whimsical side to their nature, this deck would be a fine choice!  Highly recommended!!black cat on it; he acts as a sort of touchstone or common thread through the deck that ties everything together very nicely.<br />I always recommend that the absolute beginner start with the Rider-Waite, simply because it's one of the most well known decks and most books about the tarot use the Rider to illustrate the cards.

I've also found that people who are leery around tarot cards loosen up when they see these fun, playful cards:  it seems more like a childhood game than a heavy-duty inquiry, and that allows them to relax a bit and let the reading resonate with them more than they might have otherwise allowed themselves to.<br />You don't have to be a nut over Halloween and collect pumpkins, skeletons and black cats like Ms. West (or me!) to enjoy these cards, nor do you have to wait until October to use them.  They're great icebreakers at parties (Halloween or not!) and for people with a playful, whimsical side to their nature, this deck would be a fine choice!  Highly recommended!!	2001-05-17

The 1990's had \\"Where's Waldo?\\" fans bent over that book, furiously looking for a dinky little man with a funny hat and cane.  However, during the mid-1960's children were happily searching for a rather different character, Wallace the orangutan.<br />Wallace and his keeper, Mr. Frumbee, are good friends.  They often have tea together, read or simply hang about having fun.  However, Wallace DOES live in a cage at the zoo, and life there can get somewhat dull sometimes.  One day, finding the cage door unlocked, he zips out and asks a fine-looking gent where HE could get such a nice suit.  Then, it's off to the store for Wallace, and off to adventure for the reader!!  About every other page or so Wallace is off on SOME sort of adventure (we begin to get the sneaking suspicion that Mr. Frumbee is leaving the cage unlocked on purpose!), and it's the reader's job to find him hidden somewhere in the illustration.  Let me tell you, this is not an easy task!!  As an adult, I had to scan the page many times before I finally found Wallace hidden and up to his old tricks!!<br />I assume that the publishing boom that was \\"Where's Waldo?\\" actually stems from this wonderful book from 1964.  Actually, I find this book MUCH better than any Waldo book I've seen.  Firstly, there is a real story and plot to \\"Where's Wallace?\\" that is missing in his clone, Waldo.  Mr. Frumbee and Wallace are genuine friends sharing adventures to the store, the circus and even the beach.  Wallace IS difficult to find--- you need to pay attention to the story for clues and you need keen eyes to find him, but it's not at all impossible to spot him.  This makes \\"Where's Wallace?\\" an excellent choice for young children who won't have the patience nor the eyesight to squint for an infinitesimally small character on a giant page.  When the story resumes, there is both a description and small illustration to tell the reader where exactly he was hiding; this makes it far less frustrating for young children who may not have found Wallace right away.<br />The story is easy to read and engaging, making it a perfect choice for lapsitting or for beginning readers who are just starting to read with little or no assistance.  Mr. Frumbee is a delightful character in his white suit with his seeming inability to remember to lock that cage!!  Highly recommended and very fun!!o may not have found Wallace right away.<br />The story is easy to read and engaging, making it a perfect choice for lapsitting or for beginning readers who are just starting to read with little or no assistance.

Perhaps because his mind is always on other things, he's at first not sure what's happening to him when he feels a strange \\"tug\\" at his mind, as if someone was speaking to him inside his head.<br />As it turns out, a stranger from a distant world, an entity that calls itself Dar Tellum, is telepathically contacting Ralph.  Though they never really see each other clearly, and Dar's world is clearly different from ours (Dar is able to move things with his mind), a strong friendship develops between the two.  The difficulty is, of course, that because neither feel comfortable telling their elders about what is happening to them, their friendship exists in secret.<br />Ralph's father is a scientist, and the plot thickens when Ralph learns that there is a dangerous hole in the ozone layer that threatens the health of our planet(holy cow! Doesn't THAT sound familiar??).  Ralph's dad and the other scientists set out to fix the problem with a complicated rocket launch, but according to Dar Tellum (who's civilization is more scientifically advanced than ours), the solution to the problem is wrong!!  With the help of Dar Tellum, Ralph sets out to try to change the course of events without arousing suspicions or trying to explain how he, a young boy, knows the solution will not work.<br />Dar Tellum was one of my favorite childhood books, one that I never grew tired of reading. Though the writing style is a bit dated, it's as interesting to me now in 2001 as it was when it was first published in 1973.  It's a quick read with some funny moments and a general feeling of mystery to it.  Dar Tellum is never really well described because it's hard for Ralph to see him clearly.  Similarly, though Ralph and Dar speak to each other often, Dar's civilization and culture is mostly left up to the imagination of the reader. For me, this makes the book so much the better because it encourages the reader to fill in the details as you wish. Like a lot of great books from the 70's, it's out of print and may be tough to track down.  If you get the opportunity to get hold of a copy, I suggest you do so and enjoy this classic tale of science fiction.the details as you wish.

Ms. Ehlert collects different types of handmade folk art from all over the world.  In this collection, she has arranged items as varied as ice fishing decoys from the United States and beaded dolls from Africa to create a collage to illustrate this fun, colorful story.<br />It's market day, so let's feed the animals, pack up the veggies and the things to sell, and head on out to the market!!  Along the way, we'll pass colorful birds and even snakes sunning themselves in the grass.  We'll stay all day until the sun goes down and then head back home with all the wonderful things we've bought.  Told in rhyme, \\"Market Day\\" is a colorful story with a lot of energy to it. A blue bull doll from Africa carries a giant carrot to market alongside a row of papier-mache turnips from the United States.  A hand-carved cart with people from Mexico joins the procession, along with other art from Central America.<br />While she is perhaps best known for her illustration of the famous children's book, \\"Chicka-Chicka Boom Boom\\", Ms. Ehlert has written and illustrated many other books as well.  All have her distinctive cut-paper or photograph style to them, but I would rank \\"Market Day\\" as one of my favorites by her.  In a world where very FEW things are made by hand, \\"Market Day\\" is a welcome reminder of the fine art of everyday.  Highly recommended!	2001-05-15

At the beginning of \\"Moo in the Morning\\" a young child and their mother are listening to the city waking up in the morning.  Horns are honking, doors are slamming, people are yelling, and \\"there are clangings and clashes, and rattles and rumbles early in the morning.\\"  Mom doesn't mind hearing so much noise, but it's a bit too much first thing in the AM!!  SO, she suggests a trip to Uncle Jack's farm, and off they go.<br />Farm life is pretty quiet compared to city life. How will they know it's morning, if it's so quiet?  Simple, the cow begins to moo very loudly!!  Wait!  Now the rooster is crowing, and the cow is mooing.  Now the birds are singing, the ducks are quacking, the rooster is crowing and the cows are mooing!!  This is even before the humans wake up and begin plowing fields and crashing pots and pans for breakfast!!  Good grief, it's noisier here in the country!! Time to go back home to the \\"quiet\\" city...<br />Ms. Maitland has written a wonderfully fun story in the tradition of \\"Too Much Noise\\" and other stories where the characters find themselves realizing that their life, while noisy, is pretty quiet compared to other folks.  The story builds on itself in a wonderfully repetitive way that will be lots of fun for young children as they run through the ever-growing list of animals that are making noise.  The text itself bends and twists around Mr. Kulman's bright and vivid illustrations.  The pictures themselves even LOOK noisy as people jackhammer up the pavement, shout to each other, and crowds of animals wake up to start their day by being talkative.<br />\\"Moo in the Morning\\" is a wonderful choice for very young children, especially urban ones who may not realize just how noisy their environment can get!  It's a good choice for lapsitting and for young children to practice their animal noises.  For older children who are just beginning to read on their own, \\"Moo...\\" is a good choice as well because of the ease of the story and the repetition of the text.  A wonderful book!!

He's a young man with a gift for playing violin, a WWI pilot's hat, and a taste for movies at the Luxor Theater in New York.

With his vivid imagination, Leo can envision all sorts of ways to get even with Morty; they play out in his mind like the giants of the silver screen.<br />Life goes on, Leo practices his violin and even gets a chance to play for the mayor of New York while a newsreel records the whole event!  Proud of his accomplishments, Leo tells his friends all about it, only to have Morty dash his feelings to pieces when he says that Leo is full of baloney.  But, sometimes the good guys DO win, and in the end, Leo gets his revenge in a wonderfully satisfying way...<br />\\"The Saturday Kid\\" is both beautifully detailed and nostalgic.  The book harkens back to the 1930's of New York where the El trains ran high and between the rows of apartments, you could buy a slice of pie at the Automat for 15 cents, and movie theaters were palatial palaces where a Saturday at the pictures was the high point of the week.  It's a small bit of American history with a story as old as childhood:  the careful, kind child dealing with the unfair abuses of the bully.<br />The illustrations are large and intricate.  Loew's Paradise Theater, with it's footmen, ushers, doormen and elevator operators, it's twinkling chandeliers and 4-story tall screen will astonish children used to today's teeny-weeny multiplexes and VCR's.  To think that such a place once existed just to show movies!!<br />\\"The Saturday Kid\\" is truly a wonderful little slice of history, and teachers could easily form a whole social studies thematic unit around this one book alone.

We are all actors, and the scenes have been carefully designed before we enter, stage left.  However, as in real theatre, sometimes things don't go right:  we flub our lines, we don't like our costumes, or the lights malfunction.  These things very subtly change the play itself and can even change the very outcome.  However, as Mr. Cameron suggests, \\"as a tarot reader, however, you can connect yourself through a psychic process back to the original script, and become informed of deviations you may have made to the performance that is your life, helping you to avoid any unnecessary disasters.\\"<br />Mr. Cameron has produced an astonishing tarot deck as laden with heavy symbolism as any tarot I've yet worked with.  Dice, question marks and puzzle pieces can be found in most (if not all) of his cards, and each has a special significance for him.  Dice represent entropy or chance in our lives:  we may WANT the roll of the dice to turn out a certain way, but often they don't.  Like puzzle pieces, we are all interconnected and interlocked to each other in complicated matters.  As far as questions, well, I certainly don't have many of mine answered, tarot cards or not!!<br />The characters in the deck hover in an odd realm somewhere between childlike and sinister.  Many look like dolls with button eyes and happy smiles.  Some are glowering in a powerful \\"I know something you DON'T...\\" sort of way that is almost eerie.  When pressed to describe this deck, I often say it resembles something of a cross between the Beatles \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\".  Still, this analogy doesn't do the deck justice-there is far, far much more to see.<br />Many of the cards are modeled after what may be the most well known tarot deck, the Rider-Waite.  Since most people start with the Rider-Waite (it's the deck most books use to illustrate the tarot) this will certainly help the reader gain fluency with these cards.  However, be aware that the resemblance quickly stops-this is not like any other deck you are likely to run into.  Two very short examples of how these cards are different are the card of the Grand Master, a sort of levitating, psychedelic visionary that stands in the place of the card of the Hierophant in most other decks, and the Ace of Cups, which is something of a coffee mug.<br />The cards themselves are oversized, weighing in at about 5.5\\" x 3.5\\".  While this makes them easier to see and meditate on their meanings, bear in mind that they're slightly more difficult to shuffle and they won't fit in a standard-sized tarot box.  The instruction booklet that accompanies the deck is written in a more poetical fashion than most other decks as well.  Each card's astrological alignment is noted, as well as a 1 or 2 word description-- \\"The Fool (Inner Child)\\" for example.  Quite a few cards' characters actually have names, which, for me, add a more personal dimension to them.  As an example, here an excerpt from the Queen of Cups:  \\"Say hello to Fizzy, the Queen of Cups.  She represents sensitivity in a woman.  Fizzy is happy and content.  She represents our ability to enjoy all emotions.\\"<br />As another reviewer noted, the deck IS very personal, as are all tarot decks, and it may not resonate with everyone.  Someone once said that choosing a tarot deck is the same as choosing a lover.  While I don't find it to be THAT extreme, I do believe that the cards must speak to a person to be of any use to them.  For example, I can appreciate the artwork in the new Vampire Tarot, but the deck has no resonance with me as a person so I don't use those cards.  Beginners probably would be best advised to stick to the Rider-Waite, but as you grow more proficient at reading the card's symbols, those with a particular affinity to the surreal or bizarre may wish to add these cards to their collection.ader gain fluency with these cards.

In this, the prequel to &quot;Cricket in Times Square&quot;, we meet the very young Tucker Mouse and Harry Cat.  Well, actually Harry KITTEN in this case.  When our story opens, Tucker is wandering the streets of New York, lost, hungry, tired and even NAMELESS!  Determined to make something of himself, he struts off down the street searching our first his own name and then his fame and fortune.  A sweet shop gives him his name, and a young kitten, equally lost and alone, gives him friendship.  Thus is born the friendship that many of us know and love from &quot;Cricket&quot; and Mr. Selden's other books. Together the pair set off to find a place to live.  This proves to be a bigger, more complicated task than one might originally think!!  The Empire State Building calls to them--why not live in one of the biggest buildings in the whole city?  However, when they manage to finally find themselves in the basement where there are little or no people, the find themselves in a vast, cavernous tunnel of white tiles.  LOST!!  But, by keeping their wits about them, they manage to get back out on to the street. The old piers seem like a good place to live until our heroes are nearly crushed by falling debris from the crumbling buildings.  An upscale park is quite beautiful and peaceful, but too ritzy and, well, DULL for our young companions.  Deciding that this is still not the place for them, they set off again, this time toward Times Square.  There, they finally find the home in the drainpipe readers know and love so well...  There's just one problem though, and that's the local gang of rats with thick, New York accents who want to steal all of Tucker's life savings!! &quot;Cricket in Times Square&quot; is still an extremely popular book, though many of the other works by Mr. S. that feature the same characters are much lesser known.  Not as many fans of &quot;Cricket&quot; go on to read &quot;Tucker's Countryside&quot; or &quot;Harry Cat's Pet Puppy.&quot;  I myself have read &quot;The Cricket in Times Square&quot; multiple times, but stumbles across this book, &quot;Tucker Mouse and Harry Cat&quot; rather by accident!  I'm very glad I did, though!! Though the writing is a bit weaker than I expected--the story is certainly not as long as the other's in this series, nor are the events or characters fleshed out as much--it's still a very good book and worth reading.  I think Mr. Selden intended this book to be for younger audiences than those who normally read &quot;Cricket&quot;, for the story is easier to read with less detail.  The pen &amp; ink illustrations by Mr. Williams are as familiar and comfortable as those in the other books; I'm especially fond of the picture of Harry and Tucker clinging together in terror at being lost in the corridors of the Empire State Building! Weak or not, younger audience or not, this book is definitely worth reading, and will add so much to the beloved adventures of two beloved characters.

A king and queen sit on high thrones and give him a quest:  navigate the board and seek out the Gamemaster before the last star fades from the sky!<br />Setting off on his quest, the boy must make his way past fierce pawns, slick rooks, noble knights and eccentric bishops.  At each step of the game he must decypher strange riddles that the chess pieces give him to go forward on his quest.  Meanwhile, time is slipping away, the stars are fading from the sky!  Will he find the Gamemaster, or will he be trapped in this world forever?<br />Mr. And Mrs. Bochak, the husband and wife team who created &#8220;Gamemaster&#8221;, have made a visually stunning work.  Endnotes tell us that the couple created a life-sized chessboard in their yard with live models to style the cut-paper illustrations and make them more life-like.  The end result is an amazingly beautiful, detailed world of chess characters, including royalty in flowing robes and knights on strong, galloping horses.  The story is a bit weaker than the illustrations, but is certainly entertaining and will maintain the interest of young readers.<br />Many children love to play games, including chess.  There are hundreds of books of strategy on how to PLAY chess, many of which are about as interesting as watching paint dry.  &#8220;The Gamemaster&#8221; represents perhaps the only book for children outside of &#8220;Through the Looking Glass&#8221; that is more about the game itself than how to play to win.  Children who may only know the names of the pieces but little else about the game will find this a fun story, and the adults reading the book to them will find the illustrations beautiful enough to be framed and hung.

However, an unknown artist named Felix Closseau also enters the contest.  Except where everyone else's paintings are huge and feature the king, Felix's painting is small, and is of a duck.<br />Considering how seriously the French take their art, you can imagine the uproar at this ridiculous painting.  That is, until the duck QUACKS.  Then, the duck merrily waddles OUT of the picture itself, and off on it's way.  Felix wins first prize.<br />At first, everyone wants to own a Closseau, until disaster strikes wherever his works are hung.  A painting called \\"The Sleeping Python\\" is held in high regard, until the Python wakes up one night!!  Volcanoes fill rooms with smoke, waterfalls gush gallons onto the floor, Closseau himself is put into jail!  That is, until one night when a thief breaks into the royal palace to steal the crown...<br />Jon Agee has written or illustrated over a dozen books, including books playing with language-books of oxymorons and palindromes, most noticeably.  However, \\"The Incredible Painting...\\" ranks as one of my personal favorites because of it's original story and fun ending.  It's story is fun, quick moving and easy to read (though beginning readers may have difficulty decoding some of the French-ish names).  Closseau himself is quite a character, too:  a short stooped man with beret and enormous graybeard that successfully hides his face (and most of the rest of him!).  Very young children will love the fun absurdity of things coming out of the pictures, while older children will appreciate the havoc that a living painting can wreck!

Arthur raises his flyswatter to smack the thing when the fly cries out \\"Wait!\\"  Turns out, the fly is a magic fly and in return for Arthur not swatting him, the fly will grant three wishes.  \\"'Oh come on,' says Arthur, `that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.\\"  At the fly's insistence, Arthur comes up with three ridiculous wishes: a new toaster, for the crocodiles to turn into squirrels and for him and his wife to be magically transported to a beautiful island where the natives sing and dance all day long.<br />Arthur, of course, doesn't believe any of this until some time later when he comes into the kitchen to find a squirrel running about and his toaster missing.  What's more odd are the five new, shiny toasters sitting on the street corner where the crocs used to be.  How odd!!

Good grief, his wishes DID come true!!<br />Mr. Egan has written and illustrated a very amusing tale for story savvy children.  Arthur's sarcastic comments to the \\"magic fly\\" will delight children who have grown up with (and possibly grown tired of) the old spare-me-and-I'll-grant-you-three-wishes fables. The pictures are big, bold and beautiful, drawing the reader right into the story (a note tacked to the fridge with a magnet reads \\"bones, milk\\").

She can't sleep and strange, macabre thoughts go through her head.  The real fun begins, however, when she creeps to her window and sees a giant figure poking about in the 2nd floor windows across the street!  My gosh, it's a GIANT!!  The real fun begins when he kidnaps her from her bed and runs off to the land of giants.<br />In the hands of a less capable author than Dahl, this plotline would soon fizzle and become ho-hum humdrum. Say what you will, Dahl is a very, VERY capable author and this book is simply fabulous.  While most giants are the people eating kind (with colorful names like Childchewer, Bloodbottler and Fleshlumpeater), Sophie is lucky to have been captured by the BFG-- Big Friendly Giant! He's no guzzler of people (known in Giantspeak as \\"human beans\\"-- giants don't go to school and their grammer is somewhat lacking) but is rather a gentle soul who has a special trade to ply in the human world. There's only two small problems:  the BFG lives in the land of giants where the other louts would only be too glad to guzzle her right up, and there's no food other than a strange, disgusting vegetable called a snozzcumber (it tastes like frog skins and dead fish).  So, while Sophie's happy not to have been eaten up, she's none to happy to find that there's always that threat of being discovered and noting for HER to eat.  Besides, the other giants (much bigger than the BFG) are constantly running to other countries to guzzle human beans by the cartload (Chille beans are especially yummy, we're told...).

Most people over the age of, say, 28 will remember Fred Gwynne most for his role as the flat-headed, bolt-necked Herman Munster on the TV show, \\"The Munsters.\\"  He also starred in a number of miscellaneous movies and \\"Car 54, Where Are You?\\"  However, many people do not know that he is a gifted and very humorous author of children's picture books.  \\"The King who Rained\\" is but one of his fine works for children that plays with language, especially homophones.<br />Homophones are words that sound alike but are spelled differently or have multiple meanings, and this book is full of `em!!  A little girl explains all the odd things she hears her family say, like \\"Daddy says he has a mole on his nose\\".  The accompanying illustration has a tall, thin man (who looks profoundly like Mr. Gwynne himself) with a small, brown, furry subterranean mammal perched on his nose.  Similarly, the girl's mother is \\"a little horse\\" sometimes and asks for the throat spray (\\"when I bring it to her, she calls me a little deer\\").  The title of the book itself is a wonderful play on words as well.<br />Mr. G. has written and illustrated three books of homophones, \\"The King Who Rained\\" as well as \\"A Chocolate Mouse for Dinner\\" and \\"A Little Pigeon Toad\\".  He's also written a beautiful and very funny book about a girl taking her mutt dog to a dog show, \\"Easy to See Why.\\"<br />All these books by Mr. Gwynne are easy to read and lavishly illustrated with large pictures.  They're perfect choices to bring into any classroom to illustrate English homonyms and idiom.  When I use them in class, I encourage students to create their own (of course, I also love to tell them a bit about Mr. Gwynne the actor, too!!).  This and other works by Mr. G. come highly recommended!!	2001-05-04

Bits of statuary and broken pottery had been discovered through that area for many years.  What was unusual, however, was the fact that there weren't just a few statues buried in the ground; there were literally THOUSANDS of them.  A whole, vast army of terra-cotta soldiers, horses, and chariots spanned a size greater than 5 football fields, all buried for over 2,000 years.<br />One of the better-known recent events in archeological history was the discovery of the Qin army, buried during the reign of China's first emperor, Qin Shihuangdi.  Thousands of life-sized statues, richly detailed and no two exactly alike, were buried by during the first part of his reign.  During his life, Qin was on a constant quest to find an elixir of life that would allow him to live forever.  Archeologists believe that the army was made to protect the Emperor in the afterlife, should he not find that elixir during his lifetime.<br />A beautiful and fascinating book, \\"China's Buried Warriors\\" is richly illustrated with photographs from the digs.  Though they have lost their original coats of paint and are all an earthy brown, each warrior looks profoundly ALIVE, as if he is ready to spring into action at a moments notice.  It's almost spooky to see so many determined, read-for-action faces staring out at the reader from the pages.<br />Additional information, such as ancient Chinese history, the system of writing, and theories on how the statues were made is interspersed throughout the book.  This information helps the reader who may not be familiar with all areas of Chinese history or archeology.  The reader comes away with a profound notion of how long it must have taken to make these statues, as well as unearth them (you cannot simply use a shovel to dig them up, the author reminds us, they must be painstakingly dug out with hand trowels, brushes and small picks).<br />Most books on archaeology leave a reader cold and bored, especially a young reader.  What's so interesting about a bunch of clay statues??  \\"China's Buried Warriors\\" clearly is not in the ho-hum, humdrum league of most archaeological writings.  The enthusiasm and excitement the author has for the subject is immediate from the very first page, and leads the reader ever onward through the narrative.<br />As a teacher, I've used this book in social studies as a springboard to a great number of topics:  China, the past, rulers and emperors, writing, and even death and dying.  The text is written clearly and flows evenly from one topic to another.  However, very young or beginning readers may have difficulty decoding some of the Chinese words and names.<br />As an introduction or addition to archeology and the study of past human cultures, I can't recommend this book highly enough!!

Strange occurences are becoming pretty, well... NORMAL at Bailey Elementary School.  This time a huge dust storm blows into town, and suddenly appearing at the school is a squat, greenish-haired woman who's come to be the new nurse.<br />For someone who has gone to nursing school, though, she certainly doesn't seem to know much about health:  first off, she seems to have forgotten that kids need to drink water!!  Secondly, she has a very strange eye chart with symbols that don't resemble English letters at ALL!!  Besides, what do all those weird words she says all the time really mean?  You don't suppose she could be a MARTIAN, do you??<br />This book marks the 18th in the popular Bailey School Kids series.  Each book introduces some strange sort of person who could (or maybe, could NOT) be a supernatural creature.  It's a fast paced series with the gang typically throwing insults at each other, &quot;we'd better go in before Liza sneezes her head off&quot;.  Many books in the series are creepy, some are fun and silly.  &quot;Martians Don't...&quot; lies somewhere in between.  The characters are silly, but if there really IS a martian coming down to earth to invade the planet, wouldn't you be a bit wigged out??<br />A good choice for an intermediate reader, these books are well illustrated and the text is large and easy to read.  An advanced reader (like an adult) can get through one in about 45 minutes or less, making them good choices for storytimes.  Many of the books can be applied to different holidays or seasons (&quot;Santa Claus Doesn't Mop Floors&quot; or &quot;Cupid Doesn't Flip Hamburgers&quot;, for instance).<br />It's a fun series even for older students and children (I've read about 30 of them, most of which I've not even used in class!!) and definitely worth checking out.	2001-04-27

The mountain constantly drops rocks on their house; clouds form at the peak and rain falls on their house (through the holes the rocks have already made) and it blocks the sun.  Eventually, they have had enough!!<br />Ming Lo's wife sends him off to the village wise man that first tells them to run at the mountain with a large pole-this will knock the mountain far away.  Of course, it doesn't work, so Ming Lo returns to the wise man many times to ask his advice.  Each suggestion grows more and more silly until the last one that actually works!!<br />Mr. Label is most well known for his Frog and Toad books.  The illustration style is similar with \\"Ming Lo\\", sharing similar muted colors but with softer outlines.  The pictures highlight the foolishness of Ming Lo and his wife as they bang pots and pans at the mountain to scare it away or bring food to the summit to appease the mountain god.  The wise man is an amusing character, sitting under a small pagoda in purple robes smoking a pipe (he produces more and more smoke each time that Ming Lo comes to ask him questions, to the point that he can barely be seen).<br />The story is easy to read and fun without being ridiculous.  It's an excellent book for beginning readers and will keep children interested as they read on to find out what Ming Lo and his wife will be up to next!  Highly recommended.	2001-04-25

Four characters live in a maze searching for<br />\223cheese\224.  Two are mice, two are small humans.  The cheese<br />represents things in life we really want: for the mice, food, for the<br />humans it can be anything from wealth, a good job, status, good<br />relationships, etc.  The mice are adept at finding the cheese in the<br />maze and single-mindedly search it out, no matter where it is.  The<br />humans (\223Hem\224 and \223Haw\224) are much more resistant to<br />change, preferring to stay where they are, even when the cheese supply<br />dwindles and eventually disappears.<br />The moral of the story is that<br />change is inevitable in today's world.  Indeed, change is one of the<br />building blocks of the universe, though most people can't stand to<br />have things change on them.  The point of the book is to realize that<br />change WILL happen, try to see it coming, and adapt when it hits; very<br />much an expanded version of the old saying, \223bend like a reed in<br />the wind.\224<br />\223Cheese\224 is a publishing phenomena and it seems<br />either you love it or your hate it.  Some people have called it drivel<br />and a waste of time while others report that reading the book has<br />changed their lives for the better.  Personally, I lie somewhere in<br />the middle.  I agree that if you're given the book you should watch<br />out, change is about to hit you in the head, (although you should<br />count yourself lucky to work in a company prosperous enough to afford<br />copies for everyone).  It is written at a very elementary level which<br />some people may find condescending, especially those who have advanced<br />degrees or who read a lot of dense business materials all day long<br />(the Flesch-Kincaid scale rates it at a 7th grade reading<br />level).<br />However, it's usually the simple messages and parables that<br />are worth paying attention to and have timeless relevance.  If the<br />message is \223be flexible\224 or \223stay alert for change\224 or<br />even \223sometimes you have to take risks if you want to get anywhere<br />in life\224, then it's a worthwhile message to hear again and again<br />because most of us forget these things.  Yes, the book can be read in<br />less than an hour by most readers, but this doesn't necessarily make<br />it a waste of time-- I personally have wasted a LOT more time waiting<br />for busses, in meetings, in doctor offices or watching TV or<br />mindlessly surfing the Internet.<br />Generally I am suspicious of books<br />that go into a publishing blitz because they tend to burn very bright<br />but for only a short time (\223Awaken the Giant Within\224 and<br />\223Iron John\224 comes to mind as an examples of books that swept the<br />nation like wildfire, then just as quickly died out).  People buy the<br />book by the hundredweight and press it on friends and coworkers, but<br />just as quickly forget about it and it winds up collecting dust or<br />being sold secondhand.<br />It's worth the 30 minutes to read through,<br />it may even jolt you awake a little bit (and there's nothing wrong<br />with that), but I wouldn't classify it as life-changing or profound no<br />matter how many weeks it's spent on the best seller list.

Prefer to work alone??  Not much interested in surrounding yourself with coworkers every day??  Searching around for a career where you can be allowed to work by yourself most of the time??  This book is worth checking out, then, but don't stop here.<br />\\"Careers for Introverts...\\" takes the reader through a few of the more solitary careers available, mainly writer, researcher, artist, forest ranger, security guard, computer programmer/operator and mail carrier.  Each career has a short chapter dedicated to it where important information such as training/education, salary and working conditions are discussed.  In each chapter an experienced person in that field (writing, letter carrier, etc) talks openly and candidly about the pros and cons (artists &amp; writers often take a long time to establish reputations and money often rolls in sporadically; letter carriers require good memories for detail and the ability to work in all weather conditions, etc).<br />The potential reader should note that many of these careers have a relatively low earning potential (with the possible exception of computers), and in the case of artists and writers, one is very likely to find themselves doing something completely unrelated to art or writing until they are established or have a good, finished product to sell.  Also, where postal workers and forest rangers are concerned, there are often far more people looking for a job than there are jobs for them to fill.<br />Overall, the book is good for what it covers, but I find it hard to believe that with so many career options available nowadays, far less than a dozen are highlighted here.  I'm sure that a good 20+ more careers would make the book more appealing and useful.  It is helpful to read of someone who actually does one of these careers for a living, but I'm willing to bet that 8 out of 10 readers who pick this book up will not be establishing themselves as stained glass artists or live near large forested areas.  Finally, note that the book is, as of this writing in 2001, three years old.  Testing requirements for these jobs (especially forest rangers and mail carriers) as well as the list of resources/organizations to contact may have changed since its publication.<br />Is it a worthwhile resource, then??  Yes, it's worth the time to read (though maybe not worth the money), but I would recommend checking out other job related resources as well.ve near large forested areas.

He makes things in silent secrecy, and then puts them into a big sack.  He dons a red suit and hurries off in a sleigh into the night, over the snow that no one has stepped in, off to the boy&#8217;s house.<br />This was Jon Agee&#8217;s first book.  He has since gone on to illustrate a number of children&#8217;s favorites (&#8220;Dmitri the Astronaut&#8221;, &#8220;The Halloween House&#8221;) and has a whole collection of fun books on the oddities of language (&#8220;Who Ordered the Jumbo Shrimp? And Other Oxymorons&#8221; among others).  What is a surprise (and a shame, really) is how little known this small, wonderful book is.<br />And it truly is a wonderful book!!  It&#8217;s colors are slightly muted, giving it a nighttime, dreamlike quality.  The text is short (only a few words per page) but so perfectly written that it makes the book feel like a soft holiday poem.  It is a physically small book, measuring only a few inches across and tall, which would make it an excellent choice for very young readers or lapsitting.&lt;P...In a world where Christmas tales are becoming more and more about getting STUFF, this gentle book about a small child&#8217;s dream when the snow falls comes highly recommended.	2001-04-18

Jon Agee may be best known for his illustration of children's books (\\"The Halloween House\\", \\"If Snow Falls\\").  However, he has also proven himself a proficient wordsmith, easily and playfully pulling words all apart and putting them together.  \\"Sit on a Potato Pan\\" is one of five books delighting in the oddities English spelling.<br />Palindromes are words or phrases that are spelled the same way forwards as backwards.  Take the title of the book and spell it backwards, and it's the exact same title!!  These things are not easy to create, and the longer the phrase the more difficult it is to both spell backwards and still make sense.  The fact that \\"Sit...Otis!\\" is one of THREE books of palindromes by Mr. Agee only proves his genius at manipulating words and letters.<br />Like his other two books of palindromes, \\"So Many Dynamos!\\" and \\"Go Hang a Salami! I'm a Lasagna Hog!\\" (now THERE'S one that must have taken a few days to create!!), \\"Sit...Otis!\\" is illustrated with wonderful drawings that make the palindrome live and sparkle.  For example, in one of my personal favorites, two gents in the Old West are looking at a wanted poster.  Pictures of large cats are on the wanted poster, and one man says to the other, \\"darn ocelots stole Conrad\\". Another is of three men staring at 9 little pieces of scribbled on paper.  They make their own notes about them, and the caption is \\"some men interpret nine memos\\".<br />Needless to say, these things are not easy to write!!  Especially the longer, more complicated ones like \\"naive was I ere I saw Evian\\" and the one that makes the title of this book.  While not a book geared for young children, students in, say, third grade and above would no doubt get a kick out of these and other palindromes.  With Mr. Agee as a guide, it's a perfect opportunity for students to go on and create their own.  What else is Otis capable of??	2001-04-15

Oxymorons are, of course, words or phrases that are inherently contradictory:  &quot;jumbo shrimp&quot;, for example.  Jon Agee has taken everyday phrases that so easily fall from all our lips and made us realize how delightfully ridiculous they really are.  A scorched and burned man stands at his refrigerator while fire shoots from the top compartment.  Why, it's FREEZER BURN, of course!!  How about a group of drivers pulling their racecars??  Yup, you got it:  that's DRAG RACE for you.<br />Mr. Agee is perhaps better known for his children's books, \\"Dmitri the Astronaut\\" and \\"If Snow Comes\\", but he's also a master of wordplay, with three other books of palindromes (words or phrases that are spelled the same way forward as backwards) and a book of anagrams (words that can be spelled with the same letters:  \\"Elvis Lives\\").  These books of oddities of English would be as at home in a classroom as on the living room shelf.  Indeed, as a teacher, I often pull one or two of his works into class to get the creative juices flowing with my students as they try to compose their own anagrams, palindromes and oxymorons.<br />While the book is by no means complete--there are hundreds of oxymorons--it is one of the few published books of contradictory phrases and certainly the only one I know that is illustrated!  While I would have liked to see some of the more \\"controversial\\" ones (you know, the one's that might--GASP!!-- offend someone, like \\"military intelligence\\", \\"friendly fire\\" or \\"athletic scholarship\\"), the book is definitely recommended to add to your collection, whether you're a wordsmith or not.	2001-04-12

You may not know Ms. Boynton's name, but you've undoubtedly seen her illustration style on greeting cards, baby clothing and toys and in her popular board books (\\"The Going to Bed Book\\", \\"But Not the Hippopotomus\\", etc).  Her books are full of stout, brightly colored animals in sometimes the most ridiculous situations.  \\"Birthday Monsters\\" certainly ranks up there in both the favorites and the silliness department.<br />Our hero, a grey hippo, awakes one morning to a knocking at the door.  When the door is opened, the BIRTHDAY MONSTERS burst into the house!!  They proceed to decorate the house (messily), give the hippo a cake (which they eat themselves), and give presents (which, of course, they open).  They yell everything in bold, capital text, ransack the house and then...  They leave!!<br />Our hero stands, sad and disappointed looking at the wreckage for just a page or so, before the Monsters burst through the door AGAIN!  This time cleaning up their mess, leaving REAL presents and a whole cake for our hero!!  A wonderful happy ending!!<br />\\"Birthday Monsters\\" is one of my favorite board books, mostly because of the bright, vibrant illustrations but also because of how silly it all is.  The pace is fast, the monsters are messy, and the hippo is usually left standing in the carnage trying to keep up with the goings on.  This is a perfect recipie for delight for a toddler (and even a few adults I know!).<br />Early exposure to books and print is crucial for children to devolop the understanding and desire to read later (and, let's face it, reading is crucial to school success).  Board books, especially zippy &amp; fun ones like \\"B-Day Monsters\\" is a perfect place to begin!!	2001-04-12

Most children love bananas, but few actually know about the time and effort that goes into their growing, harvesting and shipping.  For those of us in the States, it's very easy to simply walk into a grocery store and grab a bunch or two.  Most of the time, we don't think about where they came from or how they got here.  However, the story of bananas is a complicated and fascinating one.<br />The book begins with the plant itself and explains that bananas are not grown on actual TREES, though the plants can grow to 8 feet or more.  We are then introduced to Manolo, a child whose family works on a banana plantation in Honduras (very far away from where one of those bananas will be eaten in the United States by Margie).  The growth of the fruit is explained and illustrated in color and sharp B&amp;W photographs.  They are allowed to grow, then cut down and sent for processing.  There they are cut off the bunch, cleaned and packaged for shipping.  Off to a warehouse, then a distributor, then ship norths to the states, then on to trucks to different markets and THEN (and only then!) is they available for the general public to eat.<br />Whew!!<br />\\"Bananas\\" is both well written and educational.  Many of us, especially children don't stop to think about how a Central American fruit makes its way to the grocery stores in Vermont or Washington.  In the classroom I've seen the book used in all different areas of social studies all the way up into 8th grade, so it isn't just geared for young children.<br />The story is easy to read, well written and does not talk down to the reader.  The photographs are many and they help show not only the process of growing &amp; harvesting bananas, but also a bit about the lives of the people who grow, pack, cut, and ship them.  It's an excellent book and even very young children may enjoy reading about their favorite fruit.	2001-04-12

If it's not weird enough to have a VAMPIRE for a teacher, then what about having a ZOMBIE for a soccer coach??<br />In this 15th installment of the Bailey School Kids series, the gang is gearing up for a soccer tournament against their ol' school rivals.  Like other sports they play, the Bailey kids just aren't doing well at all.  That is, until Coach Graves shows up and puts `em through the motions!!<br />Coach Graves has that combination of motivation, organization and sheer power that all fine teams have.  Though she drills them through some tough practices, has them exercise until the gang thinks their legs will fall off and the whole team shows up for practice reeking of muscle-relaxant cream, with her as the coach, the Bailey team might have a fighting chance!!<br />That is, until one day when a mysterious old woman comes to practice, gets into a heated argument with Coach, and suddenly the Coach Graves, who has always been in constant motion, just sits on the bench staring out into space.  Good grief!  Has Coach been turned into a ZOMBIE?!<br />I've reviewed a number of the Bailey Kids books, and believe them to be good choices for intermediate readers.  They're short, the language is easy, the type is large and easy to read (I'd say about 14-16 point), and the plot is logical and flows.  As a teacher, I often use these books to hook in reluctant readers who don't normally read for pleasure, but who also might be too spooked by the Goosebumps series by Stine.<br />As of this writing, there are some 40 books to the series, each involving some mysterious creature, anything from vampires to aliens to mermaids.  It isn't necessary to read the series in order, though some characters make repeat appearances in other books.  A lot of books in the series can be holiday-based, like \\"Cupid Doesn't Flip Hamburgers\\" or \\"Santa Claus Doesn't Mop Floors\\".  Most have a gentle blend of silliness and creepiness that is engaging without being terrifying. It's a fun series, and I've found myself reading almost ALL of them, even when I'm not using them to teach with!  So, get yourself a few and follow along with the gang's adventures!!ss that is engaging without being terrifying.

It doesn't matter at all that one of them walks on four legs and drools a lot!!<br />In this third book in the H&amp;M series, summertime has arrived with adventures galore for boy &amp; dog.  Divided into chapters, each functioning as a mini story but related to each other, Henry and his 180-pound dog Mudge explore the wide, green world of summer.  In one of the most notable chapters, a bee stings Henry, and boy does it HURT!!  Fortunately, good ol' Mudge is there to make Henry feel better (a good face-licking by Mudge helps Henry forget his pain at being stung-Mudge likes the salty taste of tears).<br />As a teacher I love the H&amp;M series because the illustrations are always bright, vibrant and immediately draw my students into the story.  I also love the short, easy sentences, which are perfect for beginning-to-intermediate readers who feel that they're ready to tackle chapter books.  As a parent, I love the way that this series is about the small adventures in life that are right on the level of the reader.  Nothing blows up, aliens don't invade the countryside sucking out peoples' innards, and the world isn't narrowly saved from oblivion.  Mudge is a wonderfully realistic dog that is completely devoted to Henry, like most real dogs are devoted to the children they live with.<br />As of this writing, there are some 20 H&amp;M books, each a small treasure and each a wonderful read.  Though they're numbered, it's not at all necessary to begin with #1 and progress up to #20; readers can grab whichever title catches their whim and follow along with the adventures.  I myself have read them all and am not so patiently waiting for the next ones to come out.  Each book comes highly recommended.	2001-04-05

I think it's safe to say that everyone has an opinion about standardized tests (ST for short).  ST's seem to be one of those things that have no middle ground, either you love `em or you hate `em.  But, whether you love or hate ST's, they're definitely here to stay, and schools across the country are likely to only INCREASE the amount of testing they do in the future.<br />Since they're here to stay, it only makes sense for teachers and educators to try to help their students perform their best on ST's.  The problem is that most of the time students and teachers don't know what form the test will take or what will be asked on the tests, and CREATING your own tests for preparation is a tedious and time consuming business.<br />Not anymore with \\"How to Prepare Your Students...\\"  Absolutely filled with multiple-choice tests that are aligned to different areas of the curriculum (reading comprehension, capitalization, spelling, math concepts like place value and numeration, etc), this reproducible book should be in every classroom where ST's will take place and there is an overworked and harried teacher (that is, in every classroom in the United States!).  This would also be an excellent resource for homeschooled children who would be required by state laws to take ST's as well.<br />The pages are easy to read and the illustrations are clear, sharp drawings.  The text font is about 14-16 point, making it easier for primary grade students to read.  Each page is clearly labeled with what the test covers, for example \\"Language Expression: Paragraphs\\" or \\"Math:  Concepts/Applications-Two-Step Problem Solving\\".  The back of the book not only includes the correct answers but teacher scripts that can be read aloud to give students the feel of taking a test where the directions are dictated.  This was a nice detail that I'm glad the authors did not overlook.<br />All tests are multiple-choice, and some are even multiple page with \\"go on\\" and \\"stop\\" symbols that are seen on the more common ST's like the IOWA or COGAT.  There is a good introduction and explanation at the beginning of the book which may prove helpful.<br />There are other editions of this book geared for intermediate and middle school grades as well as standardized test practice books for grades 1-8.  This is an excellent resource by Teacher Created Materials and comes highly recommended from this educator.he more common ST's like the IOWA or COGAT.

Mercer Meyer is best known for his series of \\"Lil' Critter\\" books (\\"I Just Forgot\\", \\"Grandpa and Me\\", etc).  In \\"One Monster After Another\\" he's created a whole passle of strange-yet-lovable creatures with fantastic names like the Stamp Collecting Trollusk, the Letter Eating Bombanant and-my favorite-the Wild N' Wooly Typhoonagator.<br />At the beginning of the story, Sally Ann writes a letter to her friend Lucy Jane.  However, before the mailman can pick up the letter, a top hat-wearing Stamp Collecting Trollusk steals the letter from the mailbox (Sally Ann's mother is seen gasping in fear as she looks through the window in her housedress and hair curlers).  BUT, before the Trollusk can collect the stamp-he carries a huge mail bag at his side that's overflowing with collected stamps-a flying creature called the Letter Eating Bombanant flies out of Nowhere (a street sign points \\"TO NOWHERE\\" and, opposite, \\"TO TOWN\\") and snaps up the letter.<br />Of course, the story hardly stops here.  Another monster, the Bombanant Munching Grimley, snaps up the Bombanant, intending to eat him.  BUT before it can do that, another series of misshaps takes the monsters (and the letter!) on another series of adventures.  Does the letter finally get to Lucy Jane??  Heh, heh, heh...  Read the book to find out!!<br />\\"One Monster...\\" is a kids' classic, and it is such a shame that the book is no longer in print, especially considering that the other books by Meyer are always on school and bookstore shelves.  The book is oversize and the illustrations very finely detailed so the reader can all but walk into the book itself (indeed, in my imagination as a child, I did that very thing, always following my favorite creature of the moment on their adventures).  The illustration is immediately identifiable as Meyer's work:  it has that characteristic heavy outline and crosshatch that is the hallmark of his illustrating style, although these creatures are like no others in the body of Meyer's work.<br />Buyers who are searching for the book may wish to periodically check in with Amazon.com's auctions or zShops, as I've seen the book for sale there a few times (though I can't imagine why anyone would wish to part with it!).  If you find it, KEEP IT.  Turn it into a family heirloom and read it often, it's one of Meyer's finest works.  In the meantime, petition the publishers!  Write your congressperson!!

His latest invention is something he calls the Soda Pop Stretcher, which is able to turn 1 bottle of soda into about 50 (that is, with the help of some miscellaneous ingredients, plenty of water and 50 pounds of sugar!).  He's the most popular kid in his neighborhood until the Stretcher unexpectedly explodes, coating the inside of the garage with sticky, foul-smelling goo!!<br />Bob's father, a delightfully ridiculous character who is the town's ferryboat captain (he wears an eye patch over his perfectly good eye, stomps around on his healthy left leg like he's got a peg leg and is fond of whale blubber steaks and hardtack), decides that enough is enough.  Bob should clean up the mess, give up inventing and join him on the ferryboat for the rest of the summer.<br />However, this book is subtitled \\"An International Spy Story\\", and it doesn't take long for Bob to discover something interesting about the gummy goo from his blown-apart pop stretcher: it totally eliminates friction!  This means that any machine parts it's applied to (his sister's bicycle, for example-it was in the garage when the pop stretcher went kablooie) now will run practically by itself because the slowing effects of friction have been eliminated.  Once this substance-called Ingredient Zeta-reaches the local scientific research community, it's only a matter of time before sneaky, international spies are hot to get their hands on some of the good stuff!<br />I was first turned on to this book back in the late 70's in fifth grade when a girl I had a crush on presented it to the class as a book report.  Out of loyalty to her (or perhaps so we'd have something mutual to talk about), I read it and was immediately hooked.  I have reread it about 8 or 10 times more since then, enjoying it more and more each time.<br />Bob's adventure starts off innocently enough (if you can call an explosion in the garage \\"innocent\\"!!), but soon he's embroiled in groundbreaking research in physics with a professor who speaks about 30 different languages...at the same time!  Soon spies are lurking about the house trying to steal the secret formula, the science research lab is constructing a HUGE model of the stretcher, the world goes through a sudden sugar crisis, and automobile manufactures are in a panic because cars will no longer wear out!!  (this was a wonderfully funny touch that, as a child, I had totally missed).<br />\\"Bob Fulton...\\" is, of course, out of print.  This is a terrible shame because it's as funny and gripping NOW, in 2001, as it was back in the 70's at the time of its publication.  Somehow it got unfairly passed by while other great works from that time period went on to be printed over and over again.  It's an easy read, a great choice for intermediate readers, and with an explosion within the first 15-odd pages, it's sure to hook even reluctant readers in!!

As a teacher, I often have teeny chocolate bars as prizes for my students, and they would walk a mile on their hands and knees for some chocolate!!  It'd be great to eat that stuff all day long, wouldn't it??<br />Or, would it??<br />In \\"Chocolate Fever\\" our hero, Henry Green, does just that.  He ADORES chocolate.  He practically WORSHIPS chocolate.  He eats chocolate cereal with chocolate milk.  He snacks on chocolate bars and pours chocolate syrup on his pancakes.  The kid is BONZO over chocolate, folks!!<br />So, when you think about it, maybe it's NOT so strange that one day at school weird little brown bumps erupt all over his skin.  They even make a popping sound as they appear!  The teacher takes him to the doctor who analizes the bumps.  Guess what?  He's breaking out in PURE CHOCOLATE!  Henry gets scared, the doctor gets inspired, thinking that he'll make medical history and be famous for discovering the first case of Chocolate Fever.  Henry runs for his life.<br />He hitchhikes with a kind trucker, thinking he'll get far, far away from this whole mess until the truck is HIJACKED!!  KIDNAPPED!!  And meanwhile, the truck is hauling a load of-you guessed it-chocolate candy bars!!<br />I personally heard Chocolate Fever read to me back in elementary school, and it really stuck to my ribs.  I've remembered it on and off through the years, and when I found it again in my school library, I read it to MY students.  They were as enraptured with the book in 2001 as I was in 1978, which is perhaps one of the highest compliments a reader can pay to any book.  Definitely a must read!	2001-03-30

Strange occurrences and weird adults are nothing new (really) to the 3rd grade of Bailey Elementary School.  However, when the thirsty new school counselor shows up with pale skin, pointed teeth and a CAPE, the gang gets nervous.  Could this be the famous Dracula come to their school??  He DOES like to sit in the dark in his office and most of the gang thinks their own teacher is a vampire!!<br />But, would a vampire-especially one as famous and ancient as Dracula himself-drink pink lemonade??  The gang is about to find out!!<br />This marks the 16th installment in the Bailey School Kids series, and is definitely one of the more creepy books in the series.  Having a vampire for a teacher is bad enough, but having TWO in your school is asking for trouble!  Especially if one is the most famous vampire in the world with an unquenchable thirst!<br />Of course, the books are all written with the possibility that the supernatural creatures (vampires, genies, ghosts and even a few aliens and a pirate) could be nothing more than eccentric people.  Of course, it's hard to believe it, and that's where the series' appeal comes from.<br />Like other Bailey Kids books, \\"Dracula Doesn't...\\" is a quick read for advanced readers and adults.  It is also a very good choice for beginning/intermediate readers who are looking for something silly and fun.  A number of reluctant readers have decided that reading actually CAN be fun after picking up one of the books in this series (there's currently over 40 of them, at last count).  It isn't necessary to begin with #1 and progress to the end, for each stand easily by themselves, though there are characters that appear in more than one book.<br />All in all, it's a fun series and as a reading teacher I've found myself hooked on these things and will likely wind up reading (and reviewing) the whole series.  Get one yourself and see if you don't enjoy following along with the gang!	2001-03-30

It's a few days before school when his mother drops the news on him:  he has failed 3rd grade and will repeat.  Joshua at first doesn't believe her, and then decides that at his first opportunity he's moving to South Africa.  ESPECIALLY after his sister, who has had no trouble through school, ribs him about it.<br />What could be worse than spending a year behind all your friends??  What's worse than being three times as mature-heck, 10 times as mature-as all the incoming third grade students??  What could be worse than reading the same ol' stories over and over and over again, all year long??  Well, I suppose terminal cancer would be much worse, but when you're in 3rd grade, being retained is a fate worse than death.  Meanwhile, Joshua's fate has just been sealed.<br />What will strike readers about \\"The Flunking...\\" is how realistic it is.  Joshua is embarrassed, ashamed, feels like a true flunky and seriously contemplates moving to S. Africa, if only he could get a ride there.  He goes from trying to make the best of the situation to feeling so down and depressed he can hardly stand it.  In other words, his character is HUMAN, and the author freely lets him run the gamut of human emotions... Especially third grade male emotions, which are usually quite complicated.<br />He eventually learns to work hard, and through the kindness of his teacher (who he first thought of as a human military tank) he begins to learn about himself.  His teacher, also, is going through some very tough times, and she shares a bit of her personal life with Joshua.  This not only makes HER character that much more human, but also connects with Joshua and teaches him the valuable lesson that at some point in their life, EVERYONE has to deal with a situation that makes them want to crawl into a hole and die.  Most of us DON'T die, of course (though we may crawl into holes of one sort or another), and most of us go on through the experience and come out the other side being better, wiser people.<br />\\"The Flunking...\\" may not be for everyone-beginning or reluctant readers may not enjoy the book as much because most of the action taking place is verbal or emotional; no bombs explode, no spaceships blast off to outer space, the universe isn't threatened and then saved.  However, most of us won't experience exploding bombs or spaceship rides, but we WILL experience setbacks and disappointments in our lives.

Frank Baum: Royal Historian of Oz (Lerner Biography)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	the man behind the curtain	Like many people (too many people, perhaps) I grew up with The Wizard of Oz only in movie form.  For many years I didn't even KNOW it was based on a book, and I certainly didn't know anything about its creator, L.F. Baum.  Though I knew there were other books written by him in the Oz series, I had no idea, until reading this biography, that there were over TEN other books in the Oz series alone.  I guess ya' learn something new every day...<br />L.F. Baum had a pleasant childhood peppered with some unhappy experiences and generally was in poor health.  Like many creative people (especially in the early 20th century) he was considered a dreamer and would probably come to no good, squandering his life and his money away on frivolous things.  Time has proven this to be fortunately incorrect.<br />One of the first males to be deeply involved with the women's' suffrage movement, he started his own newspaper as a young child, borrowing news from other papers and news sources and creating poems and puzzles for his readers.  He went on to work newspapers most of his life, on and off, doing a wide variety of jobs, including selling axle grease.  All during this time he continued to tell stories and write.  Indeed, he was one of the first authors to write stories geared specifically to children, and could even be considered the father of the modern children's book.<br />\\"L. Frank Baum\\" is packed with details of this little known man and shows a tremendous amount of effort and attention on the part of the author.  Anyone above, say, 5th grade could easily use this book alone as the sole source on his life and times.  However, it should be noted that the writing is rather dense with information and could be considered uninteresting reading-for-pleasure material for students who are merely curious about his life.  Though richly illustrated with photographs, posters and book excerpts from Baum's life and books, a good deal of these illustrations are very teeny-tiny, making the details difficult to see.  They would be more effective if enlarged even by 25%.<br />There is an excellent chapter on \\"Oz and the Censors\\", which is offset by a whole chapter just about a months' vacation.  This sort of disjointed discussion of Baum's life and overemphasis on certain details shows up every now and then, causing the reader to sometimes say, \\"huh?\\" or forcing one to reread for greater clarity.<br />As far as school-aged children go, I would fancy that this book would serve more as a resource for paper writing than for sheer enjoyment due to the volume of facts and the dryness of the text.  Still, it's an excellent book, meticulously researched, and it sheds some very much-needed light on the man whose book was the basis for one of the best-known movies in 20th century America.  When we all listen to admire Ms. Garland singing \\"Over the Rainbow\\", or cackle like the Wicked Witch of the West, or laugh at the antics of the Cowardly Lion, we should stop and remember the kind, gentle man who gave the filmmaking world the idea for these characters.tails difficult to see.

Marvin Redpost goes to 3rd grade where kids are kids and adults sometimes don't investigate the situation completely.<br />While playing ball, Marvin is accused of picking his nose by the class bully.  Like most bullies, he is just looking for something to taunt Marvin with and nose picking happens to be it.  Of course, Marvin wasn't, and of course, it upsets him.  He tries to stand up for himself, but everyone is so caught up in how funny-gross it is that no one is listening.  The trouble starts with neither Marvito the wound.  Very soon, Martin himself, now friendless, begins believing that he's a disgusting person.  That is, until inspiration strikes and he finds out that we're really all very much alike (I'll not spoil the ending for you!!)<br />Sachar has done a tremendous job of taking the subject of bullying and elementary school obsession and putting it into a very readable form for young children.  Bullies will bully and try to turn everyone against that one poor soul they don't care for at any chance they get.  What often gives them more power, oddly enough, is the victim denying the bully's accusation; in this case, Marvin vehemently saying that he DOESN'T pick his nose.  By Marvin constantly talking about it, he's actually feeding into the situation without knowing it.  Better in these cases to ignore it and let it drop.<br />However, most elementary school children don't realize the power of ignoring mean comments like that or realize that the person doing the bullying will soon get bored with the whole thing if you don't respond.  Though this tactic wasn't taken in \\"Why Pick on Me?\\", it's still a good suggestion for the \\"alternative solution\\" crowd who may use this in schools.<br />Sachar also treats the subject matter with tact, knowing that nose picking can reduce a class to screams of  \\"eeeeew!\\" in a heartbeat.  He doesn't add unnecessary details about the act, but nor does he shy away from it.  Therefore this book is very likely to draw in even reluctant readers because they'll want to see what happens next!!  In a world where we could all use a little more respect, Marvin shows us that we're all the same:  human.is very likely to draw in even reluctant readers because they'll want to see what happens next!!

Hard to write, fun to read, especially in the expert hands of Jon Agee.<br />A palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelled the same way forwards or backwards, as in \\"Go hang a salami!  I'm a lasagna hog!\\", which has to be one of the longest and most complicated palindromes in existence.<br />Mr. Agee has collected some fantastically fun and funny palindromes in this collection illustrated by the author.  There is a picture of a lion on a sunny beach with a bottle of \\"lion oil\\" behind him.  Winnie the Pooh is doing the hula hoop (it's \\"Pooh's hoop\\", of course!!).  My personal favorite (and an exceptionally long palindrome) is of an inventor in a room full of switches, gadgets and wires.  In the middle of the room sits a tiny box playing music.  He exclaims, arms out, \\"I madam, I made a radio!  So I dared!  Am I mad, am I?!\\"  Go ahead, spell it backwards...<br />In a world where good English skills are swiftly becoming a rarity and few folk seem interested in grammar or word games, Mr. Agee's book is a breath of fresh air.  At times, the illustrations fit the palindromes so perfectly that you almost forget that these are special sentences that are quite difficult to create, and the read more like a comic strip.<br />Kudos to Mr. Agee for not only playing about with words to create Palindromes, but for publishing some for those struggling folk (like myself) who can't seem to come up with any of our own!!

Personally, I find that drawing from a real human is the best way to draw, followed by a photograph of a live person, with drawings of people being last on the list.<br />I will echo the other comments of past reviewers:  the book is good but needed to have a greater variety of models, a better layout of photographs and an honest-to-goodness nude male model.  People come in all shapes and sizes and colors and a greater range of people and poses would have been more helpful.  The photographs are laid out at all different angles, meaning you have to move the book all over just to LOOK at which photo you'd like to sketch.  Finally, the male is wearing an athletic supporter that interrupts the lines of his body.  This is not a terribly big concern, but it's annoying and silly looking nonetheless.  If one paid their money to sketch a live male model, you can bet he wouldn't be sporting something as ridiculous looking as a jock strap.  Is this some sort of penis fear on behalf of the author??  Certainly there's nothing erotic about these poses and I doubt that anyone looking to be titillated would spend the money for an artists' reference book...<br />There are other references that are better (or at least more varied or not requiring the reader to stand on their heads to read it), but if you're collecting model books, this is worth adding to your collection.	2001-03-21

In the 10th book in the Bailey School Kids series, the usual gang is on it's way down to the new gym to take gymnastics.  Funny thing, though, it's totally black, spiders spin webs all over the place, there's a black cat, a broom that seems to move by itself, and the instructor keeps saying all these strange rhymes, like she's casting a spell or something...  She couldn't be a witch, could she??<br />The Bailey School Kids series is a fast-paced one full of wisecracking 3rd graders who find themselves investigating some of the strangest people in their town (the titles like &quot;Vampires Don't Wear Polka Dots&quot; should clue you in!!).  This time, their odd gym instructor says these weird rhymes that seem to somehow come true:  a girl who couldn't tumble or do a cartwheel to save her life suddenly is a pro at them.  A broom seems to move by itself and there's this giant gingerbread house in the kitchen of the gym...  Hmmm... how mysterious!!<br />Kudos go to the authors for avoiding the stereotypical green-faced, pointed hat witch of the movies and old children's stories.  To do so would be insulting to REAL witches and would only make the story goofballish, not the creepy what's-going-on sort of book it is.<br />Most adults can make their way through a Bailey School Kids book in half an hour or less.  Because their so short and fast paced, they're easy books for beginning-to-intermediate readers to sink their teeth into...  Metaphorically speaking, of course!!	2001-03-21

The Mona Lisa, for example, is considered a pivotal piece of art and is universally recognized, even though there are thousands of portraits that are both more realistic and completely finished.  Somehow, this piece resonates with people in some way so that it's appeal and visceral attraction never fades.<br />The same is true of the Rider Deck.  As noted in other reviews, there are quite literally hundreds of decks ranging from everything from baseball to vampires to dragons to unicorns.  Many people collect Tarot cards, but most everyone starts here with the Rider Deck.  Indeed, of the hundreds of books published on the Tarot, almost every book I've seen for the beginner to the advanced uses the Rider deck as an example. Most decks are based in the symbolism of the Rider deck as well and if they don't work as well, it's because they've glossed over the symbolism so pivotal in the Rider.<br />Why, then has the Rider not only survived but evolved to be an archetype of the tarot itself?  I think because it speaks to us and it's the easiest to understand even at a quick glance.  The symbolism is so strong that the beginner can easily remember what any given card represents (no mean feat when there are 72 cards to remember and read!)  The symbolism is also so detailed and deep that the advanced caster is always able to find deeper meaning, make more and more connections between cards during a casting.<br />Drawn almost like an illuminated manuscript in solid colors with clear, black outlines before the age of airbrush or computer 3D rendering, there is something timeless about it that connects us to it's rich and deep history.  It's not flashy or zippy, but yet it's imagery is everywhere if we choose to look for it (didn't Led Zepplin even put the tarot of The Hermit on one of their album covers??)<br />While there's certainly nothing wrong with exploring other decks, the Rider-Waite is the perfect place for the beginner, ESPECIALLY because any good book on the tarot will use this very deck to explain the symbolism of the cards.  Learn on the Rider, become proficient at it, then, if you like, branch out into something different like Egyptian tarot or the Halloween tarot (my other favorite for it's playful holiday symbolism).  Beginning with a different deck and working with it right away will not be as satisfying or as easy to understand as the Rider.  Like great art, it's timeless because it resonates with us in deep and profound ways.  It may not have been the first, but in many ways, it may well be the BEST., the Rider-Waite is the perfect place for the beginner, ESPECIALLY because any good book on the tarot will use this very deck to explain the symbolism of the cards.

There they meet the bagpipe playing, wetsuit wearing, Scottish brogue speaking Nessie, the camp swimming teacher.  There's something odd about her, and very odd about the shapes that seem to be surfacing in the lake late at night.  Is it possible there's a monster in there?<br />\\"Monsters Don't...\\" is a cute, quickly moving book in this series, but it not one of the best books.  It's confusing at a lot of points because the reader isn't sure if there's a separate monster from Loch Ness in the lake, or if the camp swim teacher is a monster herself.  While this may seem to add to the mystery of the series and infuse it with that characteristic weird-creepiness seen in other books in the series, here in \\"Monsters Don't...\\" it just winds up being confusing.  The ending is a bit weak, leaving readers wondering why the book ended when they finish the last page and the character of Nessie isn't very strong or well sketched out.  If you're a diehard fan of the series, then by all means read it!  However, if you're just picking up a few here and there, you may want to think about skipping this one.	2001-03-21

An old fisherman and his crabby, demanding wife live by the sea.  She demands that he go catch some fish, and the fisherman snags a bug-eyed, yellow talking magic fish.  The Fish is really a prince, and the fisherman frees him.  His wife, angry that he returned empty handed, demands that he go back and demand a pretty house from the fish.  Her wish is granted.<br />One can see where this leads to:  the wife continually demands more and more wonderful things for herself (is this where the term \\"fishwife\\" came from??) until the magic fish becomes angry and takes EVERYTHING back.  The fisherman, who meanwhile didn't WANT to keep going back to the magic fish, was perfectly happy with what he already had.<br />\\"The Magic Fish\\" is a fable that we simply don't hear enough of these days, and I think it would be good if we heard it more often.  Our culture is one where we are constantly encouraged to buy, buy, BUY and our spiritual wealth is often judged by our material wealth:  more stuff = happiness.  The tale of the magic fish, with it's stout, heavy illustrations by Pels, reminds us that sometimes what we HAVE is all that we NEED, and greed comes before a fall.  Highly recommended for all ages.	2001-03-20

Learning the alphabet can be a tedious chore.  Thankfully, Mr. Pallotta and Mr. Masiello have made it sooo much easier with their work, \\"The Frog Alphabet Book\\"!!<br />Each page is beautifully illustrated with very realistic pictures of frogs, salamanders, newts and other amphibians in their natural habitat.  One could easily use the book for a field guide if one could go to all the exotic places these fascinating creatures live.  There's the Fire-bellied Toad, who looks as if it's wearing nail polish.  There's the strange looking Olm, which is a blind salamander that lives in dark caves.  There's the Japanese Giant Salamander, which seems to be as big as a young man, and on and on through the 26 letters of the alphabet.<br />The text is brief but informative as it tells a bit about each frog and where it comes from and the back page has a little extra information about three types of amphibians (did you even know there WERE three types??  Surprise!!)<br />Though the title is a bit misleading-there are over 10 amphibians that are not frogs, including tadpoles and the Undiscovered Frog (species that no doubt exist but have not been found yet)-it is a beautiful book and a fine addition to any classroom or home.  Even children and students who are very well versed with the alphabet will enjoy reading this book for it's fine, colorful and sometimes strange-looking creatures that breathe both air and water.	2001-03-20

This time, spring has come, bringing with it spring flowers, giant puddles and new births.<br />Books in this series are excellent choices for emergent or beginning readers.  The sentences are short and easy to read, and the illustrations practically tell the story by themselves.  Like other Henry and Mudge books (H&amp;M for short), this book is divided into chapters.  In this case, each chapter represents a different story for our boy &amp; dog team in springtime (in other H&amp;M books the story is split up into chapters like regular books).<br />In the first book, H&amp;M discover a beautiful flower that has sprung from the ground.  That is, until Mudge eats it!  In the second, the spring rains have made the world puddle-luscious and they're just perfect for jumping in (even for adults!!).  In the final chapter, a neighborhood cat has her kittens, and Mudge acts as a kind of guardian/father to them when another neighborhood dog comes prowling around.<br />Henry &amp; Mudge books are by far a favorite of both me the teacher and my students.  They're about the simple happy pleasures of everyday that often we tend to overlook in the pursuit for the Next Big Thing To Do For Fun And Excitement.  It isn't necessary to start with any one particular book, but once you start reading H&amp;M, you'll want to keep reading them all!!	2001-03-20

Gremlins were first discussed during World War II when British planes mysteriously stopped working.  It was said that a little magical creature with a taste for messing up mechanical and electrical things was tinkering about and causing mischief in the plane.  If that's the case, a gremlin wouldn't bother with Bailey Elementary School, and she CERTAINLY wouldn't chew bubble gum...  WOULD SHE??<br />Welcome to \\"lucky\\" number 13 in the Bailey School Kids series.  If you've been following their strange and sometimes creepy adventures, you'll know that the 3rd grade teacher may be a vampire, a genie once moved in next door to the school, a werewolf may have been the camp counselor, and even Santa Claus himself may have been the school custodian!  That is, if you happen to believe in that sort of thing...<br />This time, Ms. Kidwell has come to substitute for the school secretary.  Once there, odd things seem to happen whenever she chews her bubble gum.  The lights go out, the fire bell goes haywire, the clocks stop working.  What's REALLY odd-and kind of creepy-is that every time something electrical goes on the fritz, a new charm appears on Ms. Kidwell's charm bracelet!!  Is it possible she's a gremlin come to play around with the school's electrical systems?<br />The Bailey School Kids series is a fast-paced one where strange, odd and sometimes creepy things are always happening.  Children who are even reluctant readers are enjoying them because of their subject matter (weird, often supernatural creatures who seem to appear in everyday settings-gremlins chewing gum, cupid flipping hamburgers, witches doing backflips, etc etc etc)-and because of the quick, snappy comebacks that are always flying back and forth between the characters.  As an adult, I can finish one of these in about 15-20 minutes and have found myself reading as many as I can lay my hands on.  While they may not be pillars of Western Literature, if they inspire your child to read, then read on!!	2001-03-20

He remembers that there will be a parade to the top of Acorn Hill today, and then he remembers that his brothers say he's too little to march in the parade.<br />Well, fine then!  He'll just have a parade of his own!!  Jamie sets off in his green sweater, hat and coat with Nell the dog and march up the center of town to Acorn Hill by themselves.  Along the way, the meet some of the other villagers, one of whom gives Jamie an Irish flag that he proudly waves in his own parade.  Does he make it to the top??  You'll have to read to find out!!<br />\\"St. Patrick's Day in the Morning\\" is a beautiful story for any child who has ever been told that they're too small, too weak, too short, too this, too that, to do something.  You can see Jamie's' happiness at proving everyone wrong.  The pen and ink illustrations are lush and detailed:  you could count the shingles in the roofs or the bricks in the walls.  Green and a little yellow are the only colors in the book, emphasizing the spirit and colors of St. Pats in Jamie's sweater, the flag of Ireland and, of course, the lush green grasses of the Emerald Isle.<br />Because it's not a book about the history or legend of St. Patrick, there is no reason to limit it's reading only to March 17th.  Teachers would find it a useful book in teaching both about Ireland and, of course, proving that smaller doesn't mean incapable.  A fine book by Bunting and Brett, and highly recommended.	2001-03-19

Divided into chapters, each chapter being a small story, he had to get his favorite baseball back from the yard of his cranky neighbor (he has a dog named Attila); his fairy godfather helps him to learn to play the saxaphone (a magic hat helps him a lot), and he has to deal with an ugly, orange bowling ball and his gobble-like-a-turkey-for-good-luck mother at the bowling alley!<br />\\"Hot Fudge Hero\\" is an excellent choice for beginning readers who feel that they're getting ready to graduate to chapter books.  Like the Henry and Mudge series or the Little Bill series by Cosby, each page is carefully illustrated and the sentences are short and easy to read.  The text generally avoids contractions like \\"it's\\" and \\"they're\\", which may seem a bit akward when reading out loud-most English speakers will abbreviate common words to contractions when they can-but helps the developing reader by avoiding all those confusing apostrophes.<br />The stories are fun and the stuff of everyday life, which goes to show that you don't have to conquer the universe or swim the oceans to have a good time and enjoy reading!  Besides, when you're done, you may even get to go out for a hot fudge yourself!	2001-03-19

Yes, this is VERRY strange:  the 3rd graders are all falling in soppy-moppy LOVE with each other!!  Could the new cook, who is serving up heart-shaped hamburgers and cookies, have something to do with it??<br />A series that is rapidly growing into it's 40's, the Bailey School Kids may have met their match when their new cafeteria cook starts whipping up luv potion #9 goodies for the student body.  This is book #12 in the series and will likely appeal to young boys for the \\"ewwww!\\" factor of students getting all mushy on other students, especially Eddie who is normally the prankster and unbeliever of all these odd occurrences.<br />Some books in the series are downright creepy-\\"Werewolves Don't Go to Summer Camp\\" and \\"Skeletons Don't Play Tubas\\" comes to mind-and some are more funny or silly.  \\"Cupid Doesn't...\\" falls into this latter category.  It's fun, it's cute, it's a good holiday tie-in for teachers in the month of February, but if it's dark, creeping heebie-jeebies you're looking for, you won't find it here.<br />On the other hand, it's a fun, very fast-moving series that has been known to rope in even very reluctant readers because of what I like to call the \\"what if...?\\" factor.  That is, nothing is plainly spelled out:  Cupid COULD be flipping hamburgers, or the new cook could just be a Valentine's Day mad woman in the spirit of things.

His fun, fast-paced style will hold readers' interest as well as the bright, fun illustrations by Alan &amp; Lea Daniel, the husband and wife team who have illustrated other works by Munsch.<br />The illustrations will rope readers in as quickly as the story when they see the teacher teaching reading in Amy's bed (the students hold a copy of \\"Get Out of Bed!\\" themselves, creating a fun reflection-in-the-mirror effect that sharp-eyed readers will love), Amy's nose being painted during art class, and the wonderful paintings of Amy's teacher trying to WAKE THAT GIRL UP!!<br />For any child who is a night owl (or, at least not an early bird) this book is a must.	2001-03-19

He is supposed to have kissed the Blarney Stone once, that fabled and mystical rock that gives one the gift of gab, and by the way he carries on, it's believed that he managed to get a bit of that rock stuck in his teeth!  He is such a fine artist of Blarney, that he easily boasts that he could out-fib the very king of the Leprechauns himself!!<br />Well, as any good Irish legend will tell you, be careful about what you say about the Fair Folk, for they have great ears for hearing and egos to boot!!  It's hardly long before Patrick O'Kelly is swept off to the very land of the Faeries to meet the king of the leprechauns himself!<br />Like any fine Celtic tale, the book is full of twists and turns and play on words, of which the title of the book is just one (I'll not give away the ending for fear of spoiling the fun for readers!).  The ending is a fun surprise for readers, as well as for our brave hero, Patrick O'K. Himself!  What will stick to readers' ribs most, however, are the illustrations.<br />Illustrated by Omar Rayyan, the book resembles now an illuminated manuscript, now a surrealistic painting.  Faeries and other Fair Folk are mischievous creatures, to say the least, and to step into their world, however briefly, is to take a roller coaster ride into the ethereal and strange.  Winged sprites flit too and fro, and the King has always about him a smile that is first playful and fun, and upon closer inspection, hinting at some darker purpose.  Once Patrick has gone to their fair land, they are all about him, hiding here and there, yet the reader knows that they are invisible to everyone-another example of that mischievous, almost sinister magic they weave.<br />All in all, a tremendous book and perhaps too overlooked in the children's section.  Though Irish in nature, it is not about St. Patrick's day, so there is no need to keep it mothballed until then!

When old MacDonald cuts the bush down and plants the tomato plant there instead, inspiration strikes.  Why not plant the whole front YARD with food plants?

Actually, she is profoundly shy, immensely shy, Olympian shy.  \\"Shy\\" doesn't even do justice to how awful it is for her to be around other people, even her own family.  So, for much of her early life, she hides.<br />Hiding is the theme of this book where young Anna, terrified at the thought of being enrolled in school, first makes a secret room for herself under the master staircase, then slowly but surely remodels first rooms, then the whole house, constructing labyrinthine secret passageways to hide herself away in.  Her family, who had difficulty seeing her in the first place, at first seems happy for the gifts she cleverly makes--food, cookies, clothing--but gradually, so gradually, seem to forget she ever even existed.<br />Anna grows up within the walls of this huge house, squeezing through narrow passages, emerging only at night to bathe and eat.  Her family goes on without her, filling the house with friends and even a suitor for her mother.  When the prospect arises that Anna's mother may marry and even move, leaving her there, unknown inside the walls, she must begin to face the most terrifying choice of her life:  to stay hidden, or to emerge from the very walls of the house.<br />\\"The Woman in the Wall\\" has been described as a `not-quite-fantasy' and it is that very mood that stays with you throughout the book.  It's told from Anna's perspective as she builds and creeps through the house, peeping in on her family and family's friends and living vicariously through them.  The concept may seem outlandish at first--a young woman so afraid of other people that she constructs secret passages in her own house without anyone noticing--but it quickly becomes believable to the reader.  We've all had times where we wish we could disappear for some reason or another, and Anna has successfully done it.  Many readers will find themselves reminded of childhood hideaways they may have constructed:  behind the couch, in the cellar, a corner of the attic.  Secret places that we could hide in and not be found until we wanted to be found.  This is what speaks to us about Anna's story:  the power to be hidden at will, to exert some control in an uncontrolled world.

He's an average kid with a nice, average family, but something has always struck him as odd.  He has red hair and blue eyes while the rest of his family doens't.  When the King of Shampoon comes on TV saying that his own son was kidnapped at birth, is Marvin's age and has red hair and blue eyes, Marvin's friends easily convince him that HE, Marvin Redpost, is really the prince of Shampoon!  What ensues afterwards is pure Sachar (and therefore, quite a good bit of fun!).<br />Louis Sachar has given us some fantastic works, including &quot;Sideways Stories from Wayside School&quot; and the John Newberry Medal winner, &quot;Holes&quot;.  For more beginning/intermediate readers he now gives us the Marvin Bedpost saga (&quot;Kidnapped at Birth&quot; is the first of 4 books in the series).  Sachar's style is always funny and realistic and his characters are human and warm.  The realistic pencil drawings by Neal Hughes add a lot of realism to the story without making it cartoonish.  Get a copy and begin your adventures with Marvin-- uh, I mean, Prince of Shampoon!!	2001-03-16

Palindromes are, of course, words or phrases that are spelled the same backwards or forwards.  &quot;So Many Dynamos!&quot; is a palindrome as well-- go ahead, spell it backwards!!<br />Mr. Agee has collected some fantastically complicated and funny palindromes in this collection.  All of them are illustrated, which add so much to the palindrome itself.  For example, two rugged cowboys are running away from a huge pair of pants.  &quot;Massive Levi's, Sam!&quot; one man shouts to the other.  Another of my favorites is of two scientists gazing through a massively huge microscope at something on a small slide. &quot;snot or protons?&quot; asks one scientist.<br />Making palindromes is no easy task, though there are hundreds of them.  Mr. Agee has proven himself brilliant by not only putting them together, but illustrating some rather difficult ones that then make perfect sense (I'll let you find out what &quot;No!  Put egg getup on!&quot; means...!!)	2001-03-16

You would think that by now, the 21st installment in the Bailey School Kids series, that someone other than a bunch of third graders would notice all these strange characters showing up!!  Actually, that's a good deal of the fun of the series!!<br />The gang is assembled again, this time to play ball against their school rival.  Problem is, they never win!  It's like the field is CURSED or something...  Along comes Coach Tuttle who is perhaps THE most uncoordinated person around!  He slips, trips, falls and bangs himself up something terrible.  It's like the man HIMSELF is cursed or something...  He even carries around HUGE bundles of bandages to patch himself up with.  When he's done, he looks a lot like... well, like a MUMMY!  But mummies don't coach softball...  DO THEY?!?<br />\\"Mummies Don't...\\" is a much more complicated book than any of the others in the series.  It involves this supposedly human coach, a missing diamond from a mummy's tomb, the Bailey School baseball diamond, Mrs. Jeeper's house (the 3rd grade teacher who is supposedly a vampire), and a curse. Somehow, it all gets jumbled up and doesn't make much sense, though everything seems to come clean in the end.  There is little suspense in this book, and that razzing-insult-a-minute that we've grown to know and love is also missing from this work. I personally was expecting more of a REAL mummy to make an appearance, vs. some clumsy dude in elastic bandages.  For die-hard fans of the series who wish to proudly say, \\"yes, *I've* read all the books!\\", I recommend it.  If you're just into reading a few here, a few there, then this one can go on the skip list.	2001-03-12

Odion, the hero of \\"The Ink Drinker\\" is back in this sequel/companion to the first book.  Young master Odion was previously bitten by a ink-drinking vampire and became one himself.  That is, his sustanence comes from the books that he literally drinks the ink from, through a straw.  When those delightful words hit his tongue, he is immediately transported to the very world of the book he is drinking. There are only two drawbacks, however.  One is that the book is then devoid of ink and useless.  The second, more difficult, is that he is the only ink-drinker aside from a dusty old vampire.  He is lonely and cannot share his secret with anyone lest they think him a freak.  But wait!!  What about this mysterious new student at school...??  What's HER story??<br />\\"A Straw for Two\\" is like the above paragraph:  heavy on flashback and light on present and future action.  Most of the book rehashes the action of \\"Ink Drinker\\" which made me anxious to get through it and find out what was going to happen next.  What DID happen next was not only predictable but short.  Predictability is to be expected in children's books, of course, but once the stage has been set, the story re-told, it is time to move on and delve deep into the present action.  Sadly, much of that is missing from \\"Straw for Two\\".  It clips along at a quick pace (as an adult, I finished the book in less than 15minutes), but the pace is SOOO quick as to leave large parts of action out.<br />While the concept of both Ink Drinker and Straw for Two is original and a lot of fun (I suggest that the term \\"ink drinker\\" replace the more antequated term of \\"bookworm\\" for people who really love to read--who practically devour text), \\"Straw...\\" leaves me wondering what happened.  The illustrations are wonderfully dark and fun, reminiscent of \\"Ink Drinker\\", but for a sequel there should have been much more than what Sanvoisin gave.	2001-03-12

Anyone for some soup made with birds' nests??  How about \\"1,000 year old eggs\\" aged in mud??  Live maggots??  I've got it, seaweed!!  What?!  You want to eat HAMBURGER?!?  HOW REVOLTING!!  :)<br />Food cuisine from around the world and the strange things people have found to be delicacies is the topic of this fun book.  While most American children wouldn't eat cooked spiders for a million dollars, they may be interested to find that spiders, grubs and other insects are considered not only cruncy delights in other countries, but pound-per-pound they have more nutritional value than most snack foods we eat in the states!<br />\\"It's Disgusting\\" is a well researched, well illustrated book that I would file in the `expand your horizions' section.  We easily forget that not everyone is like us or likes the same things we do.  Hindis would be revolted, shocked and offended if we ate hamburger in front of them.  Asian cultures find soup made from birds' nests a delicy (the nest itself is largely made of the birds spit) as well as sun dried jellyfish.  Closer to home, at one point in history in the US turkey was once considered a food that would make you stupid and tomatoes were once considered poisionous.  The passenger pigeons of yesteryear who used to blacken the sky by the millions were made extinct in part because of people's desire to eat them.<br />Meanwhile, today many food thickeners are made from seaweed or the hooves of animals (carageenan and gelatin, respectively), and some colorings are made from the carapaces (exoskeletons) of insects.  However, no one seems to be worrying about horse hooves and bug juice in their yoghurt these days...<br />The book is written well so that even intermediate readers will be able to make their way through and become enligtened about the foods other cultures fancy.  The authors strive to keep any bias out of their writing and simply state the facts:  while WE may find this food gross, other people find it a delicacy and vice-versa--there's stuff WE regularly eat that other cultures would quickly push aside.  Peppered with fun poems and bright illustrations (including some fun bar charts of the nutritional value of various foods, like bugs), this book may get a chorus of \\"ewwww!!\\"'s, but it will also expand the horizons of it's readers!<br />Now, pass the chocolate covered ants...sa--there's stuff WE regularly eat that other cultures would quickly push aside.

Well, funny you should ask...<br />Our small band of 3rd graders is presented with one of their newest run-ins with the strange and supernatural.  Out on a trip to the Burger Doodle, they run into a new counter worker, Scout.  In addition to having an odd name, Scout is an odd character!  First off, her skin is ashen white, she wears a hooded black sweatshirt, and her eyes are blood red!!  Speaking of blood red, what's that weird, thick red syrup she's always putting on her own ice cream?  It looks a lot like...  like blood!<br />It doesn't take long for the Bailey Kids to begin to wonder about her and her strange way of almost GLIDING over the tiles.  Besides, she doesn't ever laugh or even crack a smile.  It's not long before someone suggests that she might be a ghoul:  an undead creature in the service of a vampire who is in search of new places for their vampire masters to live.  When the Kids find out that Ms. Jeepers, their vampire teacher, is thinking of having her family move to Bailey City, they decide that action must be taken or else the city will be overrun by vampires!!  One for a teacher is bad enough!<br />This is the 31st installment in the Bailey School Kids series and is a bit creepier than some of the others in the series.  It's still got all the elements of the other books, a wisecracking Eddie who refuses to believe that any of these weird folk are anything but that--  just weird, not supernatural, a fast pace and fun plot.<br />I've reviewed a number of the books in the series and am finding them quite addicting.  They're fast reads for beginning-to-intermediate readers (though an adult will likely finish them in less than half an hour), and the language is simple and fun.  I often recommend this series for students &amp; children who are not very interested in reading because the pace is fast, the plot is simple, and they're generally a lot of fun to read.  So, scoop yourself out some vanilla and settle in with the Bailey Kids in this installment!settle in with the Bailey Kids in this installment!	2001-03-11

Looking like a jolly Englishman in bowler hat and moustache, he spends every day knitting on his daily train ride into the city for work. At one stop, his friend Mrs. Jolley joins him, and they both knit, clickity-clack clickity-clack, for the 45 minute ride into the city. They're both the best of friends and help each other with their knitting. Even the other passengers on the train are quite contented and comforted to hear the 4 needles steadily go (sadly, this proves this book is a work of fiction).<br />However, one day, Mrs. Jolley doesn't ride the train, and Mr. Nick is understandably sad. He is sadder still the next day when Mrs. Jolley still is missing.  He gets sad enough by the third day that he's not knitting at all, and the other passengers are beginning to miss the gentle sound of all that activity. So, Mr. Nick goes to visit his friend in the hospital.<br />Mrs. Jolley is sick and she will be in the hospital for some time, Mr. Nick finds out. Readers will immediately notice something unusual in Mrs. Jolley's room: no color.  Like early hospital rooms, there is nothing colorful to see or look at in Mrs. Jolley's room. This is in stark contrast to the previous pages where there was ALWAYS something to see from the train, ALWAYS some bright colored yarn that the two were knitting into beautiful creations (Mr. Nick was perpetually working on sweaters for his 23 nieces and nephews). Quietly, Mr. Nick sets out to change this.<br />He knits day and night-- on the train, on his lunch hour, while eating (a wonderful watercolor picture of his yarn getting tangled up with spaghetti lights up this page) and even while taking a bath. Instead of sweaters, he's making squares. When next he visits Mrs. Jolley, he presents her with a beautiful afghan for her hospital bed with scenes of all the things she loved to look at from the train knitted into them-- trees, butterflies, two smiling friends hugging, the train, etc. So, while she's in the hospital at least, she and Mr. Nick can both look at beautiful things and knit for those 45 minutes, even though they're in different places.<br />I liked &quot;Mr. Nick&quot; for a number of reasons, not the least of which are the bright and bold watercolors that grace each page (and make for an obvious and immediate contrast when they're gone in Mrs. Jolley's room). It's a perfect jumping-off point for topics such as similarities and differences, hobbies, friendship and even gender roles (who says men can't knit??). I especially liked the way the book *ended*-- Mrs. Jolley was still in the hospital, her room was still devoid of anything even remotely interesting to look at save Mr. Nick's afghan, and she was still sick. Mr. Nick was still riding the train with interesting things to look at, knitting sweaters for his 24 nieces &amp; nephews now, and the passengers were content to listen to one pair of needles going. So, not everything was neatly finished where it began...

My favorite lines from the book (p. 1-4):  &quot;These are chairs.  Patrick knew 101 different ways to sit in a chair.  Because he knew so many ways to sit in a chair, he heard two words a lot... SIT STILL!&quot;<br />Sounds like my autobiography...<br />Well, you can imagine that his difficulty in sitting still has the tendency to upset all those around him who don't have this problem (note:  MOST adults don't have trouble sitting still while many children DO).  And yes, Pat DOES go to see the doctor.<br />In all fairness, it's not stated anywhere that he has ADD, though one can easily imply this.  The doc doesn't pump him full o' Ritalin, and yes, the 101 different things for Pat to do may be oversimplistic for children with ADD.  However, there is a sad void of GOOD, non-clinical books for children who have trouble sitting still, whether or not they DO have ADD (most of the one's I've seen, like \\"Shelley, the Hyperactive Turtle\\" address specific disorders in an overly lets-look-at-your-disorder sort of way).<br />However, buyers should note that the book is not very multicultural.  Pat and his traditional, nuclear family is White, and only a half dozen, parenthetical characters who play no real role are of color.  Overall, though, the book is an excellent one and should NOT be limited only to children who are diagnosed with ADD OR have trouble sitting still all the time!	2001-03-10

Oh, why o' why is all the good stuff out of print?!<br />Stephen Manes, author of the extremely popular \\"Be a Perfect Person in Just Three Days!\\" has written a fantastically funny and poignant tale in \\"It's New...\\"<br />Our hero, Arnold Schlemp, is a typical kid.  Like many typical kids, he's obsessed with how he looks, and he's convinced that a pair of Helicopter Shoes (promoted by the famous basketball player, Ralph \\"Helicopter\\" Jones) will make his life complete.  Doors will open for him, the heavens will part and a ray of light will shine down on him if ONLY he could get a pair of those shoes!!  One small problem:  Helicopter Shoes are ridiculously expensive (is this starting to sound familiar??  Any parent dealt with this same problem??)<br />Well, he DOES get his shoes after much fussing n' fighting and hint dropping, only to find out that they hurt his feet.  In a fit of frustration, he hurls one of his poorly-made, expensive shoes at the very TV commercial selling the shoes only to have one of the characters from the commercial COME OUT OF THE TELEVISION!!  What happens next is simply hysterical, fast-paced, odd and 100% pure Manes.<br />It's a shame that this book is out of print, because it's as relevant now in 2001 as it was when it was first published in 1989 at the beginning of the Nike shoe craze.  The boy who comes out of the TV commercial comes from a world where everyone sells a product, your personal worth is based entirely on the stuff you own and everyone is ecstatically happy about the things they can get.  One (of many) small problem:  people in the TV commercial world never use money, their stuff is just given to them!<br />As a piece of social satire for young folk, \\"It's New...\\" is simply fantastic.  It's message of \\"you are more than the sum of your possessions\\" is neither overly subtle nor obvious.  Just because you see some grinning idiot on TV selling you WhizzoPops doesn't mean A) you need them or B) they're any good for you.  This is an important lesson that I think many of our young people are missing today:  commercials are brainwashing our children into becoming possession-grubbing little Perfect Consumers.  If we all had to deal with some wild commercial person for a few days, I think we too would be a bit more dubious of the claims made on commercials!!<br />\\"it's New...\\" is a fast read, weighing in at just under 100 pages.  The story is fast-paced and draws the reader in right away.  While it's not illustrated like some of Manes's other works and a bit more text heavy, it's still an excellent choice for intermediate readers.  Read aloud to younger or less skilled readers, it's a fine example of why one shouldn't believe everything one sees on TV!!

As of this writing, there are some 20+ Henry &amp; Mug books, each one a small masterpiece.  However, this is the one that started it all!!<br />Everything great or small has it's beginning, and in the beginning of THIS book, which begins, in turn, the whole series, we meet our hero, Henry.  Henry lives with mom and dad, but he really doesn't have any friends.  No other children live on his block, he doesn't have any brothers or sisters.  So, he asks for a dog.  That dog is Mudge who swiftly goes from a teeny, handful-sized puppy to the 180-pound pooch we know and love through the rest of the series.<br />What makes H&amp;M books so wonderful are the bright, simple illustrations that mirror the text and the easy realism of Mudge the dog.  Unlike other fictional dogs, Mudge doesn't talk, walk about on his hind legs or save the universe:  he is just a big, happy, loving pooch who, like dogs everywhere, is totally dedicated to his pal, Henry.  He's like a real dog...  a real BIG dog, but a real dog nonetheless.  He falls asleep when he's bored, he follows Henry everywhere and is unhappy when Henry's not around, and occasionally he eats things he's not supposed to.  Practically any child would love to have a companion like Mudge.<br />H&amp;M are one of those rare types of books that easily fall between two categories:  picture books and chapter books.  They're well illustrated and the text is simple and easy to read, but the story is also divided up into chapters (usually three).  This makes these books perfect for young readers who may feel that they are starting to move beyond picture books but may not be ready for full-blown chapter books with little or no illustrations. The stories are simple and comfortable and the stuff of everyday life, so a child doesn't need to have a great deal of worldly experience climbing mountains or leaping tall buildings in a single bound to see that reading can be fun.<br />If you start here with Henry &amp; Mudge, by all means, don't stop here!

This time, they're off on a field trip to a verrrry strange museum!  This museum seems to have a mad scientist and a very strange character named Frank!  Frank is about 7 feet tall, has quite a few thick scars on him, loves flowers and seems only able to say \\"unnnnhhhh\\"...  Sound like any horror monsters you know??  Is it possible that the Bailey Kids have found FRANKENSTEIN?  Is it possible they've discovered some sort of terrible secret?  Will they escape with their lives...??<br />\\"Frankenstein Doesn't...\\" marks the 6th book in this quick-moving series where supernatural creatures and strange characters abound.  The third grade's classroom teacher seems to be a vampire.  The camp counselor seems to be a werewolf.  Santa Claus seemed to be their janitor for a while, and now here's this massively tall guy named Frank in this spooky old museum.  What's going to happen next?<br />All the books in the series are quick-paced and quick-witted.  The class clown, Eddie, is also the one character who refuses to believe that their teacher is a vampire (though the evidence is beginning to grow on him by this book!), there are werewolves running amok or aliens have invaded the school (that's in the next book, \\"Aliens Don't Wear Braces\\").  Indeed, Eddie functions as the only voice of reason (albeit a very sarcastic voice!).  Part of the fun of the series are Eddie's wisecracks but also the way that everything isn't 100% spelled out for the reader.  Maybe Frank really IS Frankenstein, maybe he isn't.  The evidence points that way, certainly, but who can really tell?<br />\\"Frankenstein Doesn't...\\" is a tad creepier than some of the other books in the series, but not what I would call scary or horrifying.  Therefore, it's a good selection for beginning/intermediate readers who are looking for something that will hold their interest but won't scare the daylights out of them like other books in the horror genre.  The text reads quickly (as an adult, I can polish off a \\"...Doesn't...\\" book in about 20 minutes) and the pencil illustrations augment the story wonderfully.  It's really an addictive series!

Santa Claus has (maybe...) come in to clean floors.  The 3rd grade teacher is a vampire.  Ghosts eat potato chips and NOW, it seems an alien has come to take over the art class!<br />Mrs. Zork is the new art teacher, and she is by far one of the strangest Bailey School characters yet.  When she first comes to class, her hair is dead white, as is her skin-she looks like chalk.  And what's with this business of her wearing braces??  And why did the power go out in the school right before she arrived?  Come to think of it, what was that strange sound and light in the sky right before she came to school...??  My gosh, is she an alien from outer space?!<br />\\"Aliens Don't...\\" is the 7th book in the Bailey School Kids series, and marks a return to strange and creepy characters.  Some other books, like \\"Santa Claus Doesn't Mop Floors\\", were more funny and enjoyable than weird and creepy.  Something about Mrs. Zork, with her pale skin, white hair and odd ways (she doesn't even know what painting is!) is just plain strange.  What's far MORE strange is how things seem to be loosing their colors when she's around...  Pictures near the art room seem to be fading, flowers are dull-looking when she's around them, and what's more, isn't Mrs. Zork's pale skin starting to show some color??<br />The Bailey School Kids series is a fast paced, often funny set of books that will appeal to a lot of young readers who are looking to branch out into short, illustrated chapter books.  The subject matter-- strange and supernatural creatures with an oddly human twist (like wearing braces)-- is likely to appeal to most young readers.  There's plenty of evidence pointing to Mrs. Zork being an alien from outer space.  However, like the other books in the series, there is also room for doubt, usually expressed through the opinions of the unbelieving class clown, Eddie.  The fact that only about 4 or 5 of the 3rd graders at Bailey ever even NOTICE these weird goings-on and that they share a secret is one of the appeals to this series.<br />\\"Aliens Don't...\\" is a more engaging read than some of the other books in this series, perhaps because Mrs. Zork is just so strange and creepy (really, wouldn't a woman with dead-white hair and skin and shiny, glowing braces creep YOU out??).  Yes, the illustrations are a bit cartoon-like and may detract from the story for some readers, but it's also a fun, swift read for beginning and intermediate readers.

What if you could be granted 3 wishes...  The Bailey School Gang is convinced they can do just that after they find an old bottle wedged in a tree in the school yard.  They uncork it, a horrible smell issues forth, and the next day a very tall bald man named Gene shows up riding a purple bicycle.  When the kids wishes suddenly start coming true (or is merely just a coincidence??) they become convinced that Gene is really a genie!!<br />The Bailey School Kids is an addictive series.  This is number 8 and already I'm working my way through the next 5 or 6, and I'm an adult!  Less creepy-spooky than others in this series (\\"Werewolves Don't...\\" and \\"Aliens Don't...\\" are more spooky than this one), this book is nevertheless a lot of fun.  Gene mysteriously appears and laughs a loud laugh every time one of the kids offhandedly wishes for something.  Then, that wish comes true!  While our buddy Eddie doesn't believe that Gene could be a magical creature (does Eddie EVER believe anything??), readers will be very hard pressed to explain that he's not when they find out what happens to the Kid's normally boring, work-driven teacher!<br />The \\"...Don't...\\" series (as I call them) are all quick reads that weigh in `round or under 100 pages.  The story is easy to read and the plot catchy--what would YOU do if you wishes seemed to come true from a purple bicycle-riding genie?  This makes \\"Genies Don't...\\" a good choice for beginning-to-intermediate readers or children/students who are normally reluctant to read.  I wouldn't classify it as MY personal favorite, but I still enjoyed the book a good deal and would recommend it.	2001-03-07

If vampires don't wear polka-dots, and genies don't ride bicycles, then a pirate certainly wouldn't be caught wearing pink sunglasses, would he??<br />Welcome to book #9 in the Bailey School Kid's series (which I affectionately call the \\"...Don't...\\" series for it's wonderful titles of mythical/magical creatures who don't do something or other).  This time the kids are off (again!) to camp Lone Wolf (originally visited in book #2, Werewolves Don't Go to Summer Camp).  Every year they take place in a rowing competition, and every year they are trounced.  That is, maybe until THIS year when Captain Read shows up!<br />And what a character the Captain is!  He sports a striped shirt and dewrag like a real pirate, and even has an obnoxious parrot that spouts bits of wisdom and seems to be spying on the gang.  Read seems to know a great deal about an ancient buried treasure that a mad female pirate had buried around Bailey City somewhere.  Some kids even begin to think he IS a pirate.  But, if he WAS, he wouldn't be wearing those giant pink sunglasses, would he...??  WOULD he...??<br />I've reviewed the other books leading up to this one, and again I must say that the \\"...Don't...\\" series is a fine choice for beginning/intermediate readers.  The pace of the text is quick, easy to read (I can polish off one of these books in about 20 minutes) and fun.  While not spooky like some others in this series, \\"Pirates Don't...\\" is a lot of fun.  One can just hear Captain Read growling in a guttural Irish/sea shanty sort of voice as he calls out \\"ahoy!\\" and all that piratical stuff (this would make a good selection for reading aloud simply for the chance to make fun voices).<br />As per usual in the series, Eddie doesn't believe Captain Read is a pirate or is in search of buried treasure, and children could easily copy him and make a game out of arguing if or if not the Captain really IS a pirate.  This is a good deal of the series' appeal, I think:  the small group of students who seem to be the only ones who notice anything weird going on and their investigations into whether or not these strange folk are what they might be (a vampire, werewolf, ghost, pirate, etc...).<br />Although the series is in numerical order (as of this writing, it goes up to at least 40), and though some characters make reappearances, it isn't necessary to begin reading at any given point to enjoy the series.  Grab one or two (including \\"Pirates Don't...\\") and see if YOU too, aren't hooked!!seem to be the only ones who notice anything weird going on and their investigations into whether or not these strange folk are what they might be (a vampire, werewolf, ghost, pirate, etc...).  <br />Although the series is in numerical order (as of this writing, it goes up to at least 40), and though some characters make reappearances, it isn't necessary to begin reading at any given point to enjoy the series.

Unusual occurrences are becoming...well, *usual* in and around Bailey School.  The third grade has a vampire for a teacher.  A werewolf is the local camp counselor, and even Santa Claus has put in an appearance as the elementary school's custodian.  So, should it really be ALL that odd to find a potato chip-munching ghost at Aunt Matilda's house??<br />Eddie &amp; the gang are back in this, the 5th installment of the Bailey School Kids series.  This time Eddie's old Aunt Matilda is at home sick and Eddie's mom has sent him over to tend to her.  In addition to being a very grumpy, demanding old woman, her house appears to be haunted!  Weird noises come from the creaky old attic, food left lying out is mysteriously eaten though no one is around, Aunt M. herself talks to her dead husband, potato chips fall to the ground and spell out mysterious words...  Just what IS going on around here??  IS there a ghost in the attic??<br />Unlike the other Bailey School Kids books where the supernatural creature has a main role (vampire as teacher, leprechaun as basketball coach, etc), the ghost is not one of the main characters and seems to occupy the fringe of the story.  This adds a note of realism to this series and makes it much more like a traditional ghost story (that is, creepy!).  While not as outright scary as other books in the intermediate horror/spooky genre, \\"Ghosts Don't...\\" is a departure from the more-amusing-than-scary books preceding this one.  I still wouldn't classify it as \\"horror\\" fiction, because while it does get creepy sometimes, it's hardly horrifying.<br />It's an easy read and catchy series.  As an adult, I can finish off a Bailey School Kids book in about 20 minutes and have found myself working my way steadily through the series (reviewing most along the way).  They're fun and quick, and hence even children and students who don't usually read find themselves easily reading them cover-to-cover.	2001-03-06

I once saw a plaque that said \\"that stirring in your soul is the Goddess awakening.  And yes, it is a powerful hunger.\\"  For those who are feeling a stirring in their soul and wish to explore the earth-religion of Wicca, Cunningham's book is a perfect starting place.<br />Cunningham touches briefly on the history of Wicca (it's one of the oldest faiths on our planet and from which many popular modern faiths spring from, including Christianity), and outlines what a Wiccan is and is NOT (no, a Wiccan does NOT worship Satan-in fact, the concept is absurd;  Satan is a Christian construction.  If one does not believe in Christianity, then one does not believe in [or worship!] a Christian devil).  He explains the tools of Wicca, how to set up a home altar, and how to cast spells (reviewer's note:  spellcasting is the same as Christian prayer:  it is a way of focusing one's energies and affecting one's environment).<br />Wicca can be practiced in a group, known as a coven.  However, considering that many people are in the (broom)closet about practicing the Craft, it can be very difficult to find like-minded individuals to practice and celebrate with.  However, unlike other faiths, one can practice Wicca by themselves as a solitary.  Cunningham shows you how, and shows you in an easy-to-understand, easy to follow way.<br />Mr. C. stresses early on that the Craft may not be the spiritual path for everyone.  However, if you're feeling that stirring in your soul, this would be an excellent place to begin, to see if this is the path the Goddess is leading you down.	2001-03-06

Is there a more frustrating pastime for parents?  Have you ever heard (or SAID!) something like, \\"if you don't stop that, you and your bed are going to go through the floor!!\\"  Well, here's what would happen if you ever DID...<br />Walter is in his bright yellow P.J.'s getting ready for bed.  This means JUMPING on the bed, of course, much to his father's chagrin.  Suddenly, after a particularly high hump, his whole BED goes through the floor into Miss Hattie's kitchen below (she's eating spaghetti and meatballs, Walter's favorite).  The force of this crash causes HER floor to cave in, and they both tumble down, spaghetti, bed and all, into Mr. Matty's TV room.  Guess what happens to HIS floor??  Yup!!<br />Walter plummets through an aquarium, a huge box of collectable stamps, a house built of toy blocks and a painter's studio before finding his way to the surprise ending in the basement of the apartment.<br /> All the neighbors have wonderful rhyming names like Miss Hattie, Aunt Batty, Mr. Hanratty and Fatty Cat, making this book a wonderful choice to teach phonics and language (rhyming, vowel/consonant, long vowel sounds, etc).  The illustrations are bright, detailed and engaging making it a \\"read it again!\\" selection for everyone.  The topic is sure to be one that every child has thought about (\\"what if my bed DID go through the floor...?\\") and will provide hours of fun reading.  Definitely add this one to your collection!!	2001-03-06

I bet this one is hysterical!\\"<br />She was right.<br />The obvious role-reversal of Wolf and Pig in the retelling of this old classic is sure to make any child giggle even before the book is opened.  Once you DO start reading it, stand back!  Three cuddly little wolves are sent by their mother out into the world to make their way (mom is painting her nails black and has curlers in her hair and tail--a very nice touch!).  The three wolves, in a departure from the original tale, borrow some bricks from a passing kangaroo and build a sturdy brick house.<br />All goes well and they're out in the garden playing croquet when the Big, Bad Pig comes sauntering along.  The wolves hid inside, won't let him in, and the Big Bad Pig tries to blow the house down.<br />He cant, of course.  The house is brick!  But, \\"the pig wasn't called big and bad for nothing.  He went and fetched his sledgehammer and knocked the house down.\\"  The illustrations by Ms. Oxenbury of the pig smashing the walls with a hammer while the wolves flee through a window is worth the cost of the book alone.  But, wait!  There's MORE!<br />They build a succession of stronger houses, each which is demolished by the pig (he uses a pneumatic hammer and dynamite).  Only when they try to change their tactics and make a house of FLOWERS does the pig change his ways and see how destructive and obnoxious he was.<br />This is a marvelous book, and no mistake.  There are probably a good 200 versions of the Three Little Pigs, many of which end with the grisly death of the wolf.  In the Three Little Wolves, not only is the reader immediately hooked on the role reversal of wolf and pig, but the text and illustrations are simply hysterical and the peaceful ending make it far more enjoyable than the original fable.  This is a book that should be in everyone's library!!	2001-03-06

He also lives at home with his horrible grandmother, a woman so awful that only the great imagination of Roald Dahl could have conceived her (she may even be WORSE than Mrs. Twit!!  Hard call on that one...).<br />She really is terrible.  \\"She was a selfish grumpy old woman.  She had pale brown teeth and a small puckered-up mouth like a dog's bottom\\" (how's THAT for descriptive??).  What's more, she's perfectly dreadful to George.  She hurls astonishing verbal abuses at him, tells him terrible, frightening lies (like eating beetles and caterpillars is supposed to be good for him) and scares him half to death with her piercing stare and strange tales, \\"I know a great many secrets...  Some of us know secrets that would make your hair stand straight up on end and your eyes pop out of their sockets...\\"<br />She is, in short, profoundly disgusting.<br />However, she is also old and feeble and requires a daily dose of brown medicine.  One day, when left alone with her, George decides to cook up a NEW sort of medicine for her.  So, he fetches the BIGGEST pot he can find and begins to put EVERYTHING (and I do mean EVERYTHING!) he can find into it.  Including (but hardly limited to) a quart of brown glossy paint to disguise it as grandma's regular medicine.<br />The results are astonishing and truly Dahl.  Grandma undergoes an astonishing transformation and the already-quick pace of the book gets even quicker!!<br />Though short, \\"George's Magnificent Medicine\\" is an absolute laugh riot the whole way through.  Rarely do I laugh out loud when I read, even if the story is very funny.  However, where THIS book is concerned, I was howling!  Dahl's mastery of language and the illustrations by Quentin Blake make the story so vivid and alive and real, it's as if you're standing by watching the drama unfold.  The pace is quick enough to keep everyone interested, even those folk who may not necessarily like to read.  The slapstick action and timing of the story will keep even the most reluctant reader laughing and saying \\"oh, no!  What next?!\\"  Truly a wonderful book and highly recommended.action and timing of the story will keep even the most reluctant reader laughing and saying \\"oh, no!

Something very weird is going on at Bailey Elementary School.  It's plenty weird enough when you think your teacher is a vampire from the Transylvanian mountains, but what are you supposed to do when your substitute gym teacher seems to be a leprechaun??<br />Eddie, Melody and the gang are back in this, the 4th installment of the Bailey School Kids series, and as per usual, they're up to their old tricks... Especially Eddie.<br />Mr. O'Grady is from Ireland, and is perhaps the shortest, most wrinkled man in the world.  But boy, can he dance a jig and play basketball!!  Why, it's almost magical the way he moves so fast and gets that ball through that hoop so easily!  And what's with that bag of jewels he's always carrying with him??  Strange things seem to happen when he touches them...<br />The Bailey School Kids series has by now established itself as fun, fast-paced series where unusual things happen to the third grade gang. The most fun for young readers will be that nothing is explicitly spelled out for the reader:  Mr. O'Grady COULD be a real live leprechaun (and their teacher COULD be a real vampire), or he could not be.  A good deal of the evidence points to \\"yes!\\" but not enough to be100% sure (although, by the 4th book, if you've read them in order, you're starting to get a sinking feeling that there ARE mythical/supernatural creatures visiting the school).<br />This book is less creepy or scary than the first two have been, and is much more light-hearted and fun.  Therefore, it's a good choice for beginning readers who are easily spooked.  It's a fast-paced read as well, which will snag the interest of even reluctant readers.	2001-02-11

The genius of Murakami's &quot;Wild Sheep Chase&quot; (like the genius of his other works) is the total believability of his characters and plot.  Everyone who reads this work is immediately engrossed and sucked in, and only realizes how truly bizarre the whole thing is when they try to tell someone else about the book.<br />The narrator of &quot;Sheep Chase&quot; begins as something of an Everyman.  His mate leaves him, his job pays him well but isn't very satisfying, he is intelligent but little in his life seems to stimulate him to thought.  You wouldn't say he is going through life with blinders on, but nor is his life totally examined, either.  Life is, more or less, something that is just happening to him.  You could probably think of a dozen people you know who would easily fit his character.<br />Still, this is a Murakami novel, after all, and pretty soon he is, in the words of Tolkein, simply swept away, a stranger in a strange land with no idea of how he got there.  A perfectly ordinary photo that he uses in a brochure catches the attention of a powerful political figure, &quot;The Boss&quot;, who has been inexplicably lying on the verge of death for some years, hanging on as if by some supernatural power.  The photo, it's discovered, has a special sheep in it.  A type of sheep who's breed does not exist.  A minion of The Boss makes him an offer he cannot refuse:  find that sheep...<br />He meets up with a young woman who, among other things, is a call girl for an exclusive members-only club, and does ear modeling on the side.  Together, they set off to find this elusive sheep-that-doesn't-exist, all the while trailing the narrator's old friend, The Rat, who seems to always be one step ahead of them.<br />Much has been written about Murakami and &quot;Wild Sheep Chase&quot;, including that this work is a shining example of the postmodern novel.  While this may be the case, potential readers shouldn't shy away from this book simply because they may not know a fig about postmodernism. Unlike other &quot;postmodern novels&quot;, which are often thickets of high rhetoric and voluminous nonsense, &quot;Wild Sheep Chase&quot; can be read on a multitude of levels:  both as lit crit and as pure, enjoyable fiction.  To read it strictly as one or the other is to do a great injustice to this work.know a fig about postmodernism.

Perhaps even the whole world.  Mr. Twit hasn't combed or washed his huge, shaggy beard in YEARS, and it's full of nasty bits of rotting food (the illustrator even has a close-up shot for those who really want to experience it!!).  Mrs. Twit has a glass eye and years of thinking ugly thoughts has turned her into the most ugly woman one could imagine (this actually makes a good deal of sense, doesn't it??)<br />The Twits hate everything, including each other.  A plotting look from Mr. T provokes Mrs. T to put her glass eye into his beer.  This causes him to pull a dirty trick on HER.  Then back and forth, back and forth.  Indeed, the author tells us we could go on like this forever with these two nasties.<br />The book goes on to tell of the Twits's trained monkeys who are forced to stand on their heads for hours at a stretch, and of Mr. Twits's favorite dinner, bird pie (made by smearing glue on a dead tree and then cooking up every type of bird that gets stuck there).  The monkeys go on to save flocks of birds and then play a most excellent trick on the Twits themselves!!<br />The late Mr. Dahl is, of course, a genius of the wicked, strange and disgusting.  This book is no exception!  The Twits is a book that will make most grownups say, \\"ewww!  Disgusting!\\" and most children say, \\"Hehehehe!!  Cool!!\\"  It's a fast-paced read and short, so it won't be intimidating to new readers.  The illustrations are, like the story, frenetic and gross and therefore are a perfect compliment.	2001-02-11

He also keeps turning down the thermostat to meat locker temperatures and shows an amazing ability to clean up the most horrible messes within moments...  Magic, perhaps??<br />This book is much less frightening than the first two books which involved more supernatural creatures and creepy goings-on.  For young readers who may get spooked all too easily, but who like a good mystery (IS Mr. Jolly REALLY Santa??), this would be a good choice.  Children who are LOOKING for that spooky, creepy sort of plot line (a few steps lower on the scariness scale than the Goosebumps series) may be disappointed with this installment.  Still, it is a fast-paced, short book, so it is a good choice for emergent readers.	2001-02-11

In this, the second in the Bailey School Kids series, we are reintroduced to the gaggle of third graders who we first met in &quot;Vampires Don't Wear Polka Dots.&quot;  In that book, our heroes became convinced that their new teacher from Transylvania was a vampire.  Now, they're off to summer camp to meet a very strange--and especially hairy!--camp counselor.<br />An odd bird he is indeed.  First off, he's THE hairiest person the gang has ever seen, but stranger than that is his taste for practically raw, cold hamburger, his habit of never wearing shoes and staying away from campfires.  When he tells the story of how a young boy disappeared from the camp, hints at the possibility of werewolves around the camp, and when a mysterious, shaggy figure is seen running off into the night near the night of the full moon, the gang gets scared.  As they say, something weird is definitely going on.<br />&quot;Werewolves Don't...&quot; is scarier than the first book in this series.  Strange things happen at night, and when the gang strews wolfsbane and mistletoe around the counselor's cabin (two potent treatments for werewolves), he takes the day off sick, then shows up for coffee shaven, well dressed and with shoes:  a totally different person!  That night (the night of the full moon) the campers go for a midnight hike and things REALLY start getting hairy!<br />This book, like the others in the series, is both entertaining and engaging.  In each book, it's never stated outright, in fact, that the main characters are really supernatural:  a quick reader could argue that they're not and have evidence from the text to back up their opinion.  The pace is fast, the action is creepy, so it's a book that is likely to hold just about any young person's interest, including reluctant readers.  In fact, ESPECIALLY reluctant readers.

The author, Dr. S, is a very strange looking character in his author photo, dressed in a half-tie and Hawaiian shirt with that messy hotdog, but something about his eyes and what may be a smirk on his lips makes Milo want to check the book out.  After all, who WOULDN'T want to be perfect?<br />He takes it home to read and immediately finds out that the road to being perfect is paved with strange tasks.  Wearing a stalk of broccoli around your neck for one day and night, and not eating anything, for example.  It's enough to make people wonder if you've lost your marbles.  Still, if broccoli-wearing brings Milo perfection (kinda' like fasting brings inner awareness), then so be it!  Bring on the green stuff!<br />B.A.P.P.I.J.T.D. is a quick, fast-paced read that will entertain and draw in even the most reluctant readers.  It's short, weighing in at under 100 pages, so the length won't intimidate beginning readers.  It is funny, ridiculous and clips along at a pace where you can't help but keep reading to find out what could possibly happen next.  The language is easy to read but not condescending to young audiences.  I teach reading to a group of normally reluctant, low-level readers, and within the first page everyone was hooked!  Many of my students even asked if they could read THE WHOLE THING by the next day's class.  Lo and behold, most of them *DID*!!  This was not my doing; this was the ease and engagement of the book itself.  Don't just take MY word for it, take it from the students who normally hate reading:  this is a fine, fun book!ok!	2001-02-08

In the Community everyone has their chosen job to perform:  Laborer, Nurturer, even Birth Mother.  As a Twelve, Jonas is to take his place in the Community by being given his career.  He is chosen to be the next Receiver of Memory.<br />Jonas soon finds out that to be the new Receiver means that he is to receive all of the memories from all time, including the memories of things that do not exist in the world anymore.<br />...The most obvious reason for this huge turnout for a lesser-known young adult book is obvious:  it is simply a fantastic work.  Ms. Lowry starts off painting such a beautiful picture of this perfect world Jonas inhabits that we, as readers in this more than imperfect world, wish we could join him in his utopia, even with so many personal decisions being made for him.  However, slowly, bit by bit, we realize how limiting his world really is as he is exposed to more and more of what we call &quot;normal life&quot; that he has never even conceived of.<br />&quot;The Giver&quot; is a work of sheer genius for all ages.  However, most will encounter it first in school language arts/reading classes.  Somehow I managed to miss it through my formal school education and finally picked it up at the ripe age of 32.  It sings out to me as a brilliant work as much at my current age as I know it would have if I had read it in junior high.  If you have not yet read it, you simply have to.	2001-02-06

Not only has he made this class too hot to handle, it means that a NEW teacher is soon to come in!!  Ahhh, fresh blood!! (so to speak!)<br />Well, Bailey Elementary had no idea what they were in for.  Their new teacher is a tall, red-haired woman with &quot;eyes the color of lime Kool-Aid&quot;.  She's also Transylvanian and an absolutely no-nonsense sort of teacher.  Most students are immediately intimidated by her thick accent and piercing stare, and almost immediately all students calm down and become the sort of dream students most teachers wish for.<br />Almost all, that is.  Let us not forget about Eddie, who is determined to make sure that the room is run according to HIS adjenda, not hers.  At least that's his plan.  Of course, Ms. Jeepers has her OWN ideas of how a class should be run.<br />Suffice it to say that strange and sometimes creepy things begin to happen in class.  All the wonderful tricks Eddie tries to play just somehow *don't work*, and there's no good reason why not.  Indeed, sometimes tricks that should work perfectly well suddenly defy all laws of physics and logic--like things thrown suddenly changing direction and flying *back* at the thrower-- and, what's more, only when Ms. J is rubbing that strange, glowing brooch she always wears...<br />As of this writing, there's over 30 Bailey School Kids books, each with a &quot;Don't&quot; title, like &quot;Ghosts Don't Eat Potato Chips&quot; and &quot;Werewolves Don't Go to Summer Camp&quot;.  What sets each one apart and makes each worth reading is a light blend of camp and creepiness.  The kids throw insults back and forth at each other, and the pace of the book is quick enough to keep even the most jaded reader interested.  Yet, the books have moments of real creepiness; finding a coffin-sized box in the basement of Ms. J's house, for example.<br />What makes the books even more enjoyable is the lack of concrete evidence one way or the other regarding the new, odd character.  Maybe Ms. J really IS a vampire, maybe she's not.  Maybe there really IS a werewolf at summer camp, maybe there isn't.  Quick-witted children and students can easily argue either side of the coin.<br />Less frightening than the Goosebumps books, this series is a great choice for early readers who are looking to have their spines tickled, but not necessarily completely shaken up.

In Mr. Johnston's &quot;The Vanishing Pumpkin&quot; we are introduced to a 700-year old woman and an 800-year old man.  This immediately sets the tone for the high level of playful silliness the reader will encounter in the pages within!<br />Our heroes have a problem:  their pumpkin, destined to be a pumpkin pie, has gone missing suddenly, and on Halloween, no less!  Right then, the search (and the fun!) begins.  It's not in the coffeepot.  It's not in the bed, it's not anywhere!  &quot;Snitched!&quot; cries the old woman.  &quot;'Great snakes!' croaked the old man.  'Who would dare snitch a pumpkin from an 800-year old man?'&quot;<br />Who indeed...!!  They set off down the road to find the missing pumpkin and run into some wonderfully kooky Halloween characters, including a ghoul in stovepipe hat and button boots, a rapscallion picking mushrooms (he is in a heavy cloak with a hooded mask-- my Star Wars savvy students said he looks like a Jawa), a rat-like yellow varmint and finally a wizard in starred robes, spectacles and pointed shoes.  All along the way the old man and the old woman play tricks on these funny folk to try to get them to surrender the pumpkin which, of course, they don't have.<br />The illustrations by Tomie dePaola are wonderfully funny in the way that only Mr. dePaola can make them.  Though this is a Halloween story, the illustrations are bright and silly enough to make the story much more funny than frightening.  The pace of the text flows quickly but is repetitive enough for young readers to stay hooked by the story.<br />All in all, it's a wonderful book, and you shouldn't wait for Halloween to go out and get a copy of this fun, fantastic tale!	2001-01-26

To the western mind, mummies have always conjured up mental scenes of dusty, Egyptian tombs where a white-haired archeologist is suddenly set upon by a bandage-wrapped figure that unexpectedly throttles him to death.  We'll see young children who have very patiently bound themselves up with layers of toilet paper lumber down the street at Halloween groaning out tricks or treats.  The few of us who have actually SEEN a real mummy often find them rather disturbing looking or, in the words of one of my students, \\"eeeewwwww!!!\\"<br />Here to lay many of those untrue myths to their final rest (pun intended) are James M. Deem and True Kelley with their book, \\"How to Make a Mummy Talk.\\"  The book takes some of the most popular myths and untruths of mummies (mummies are all from Egypt, mummies are all found in tombs, etc) and sets the record straight.<br />While the intentional preservation of deceased humans by mummification is thousands of years old, as in the case of Egyptian Pharos, this is certainly not the only place, time or way that mummies have been made.  In fact, the oldest mummies don't even come from Egypt:  they hail from South America.  Mummies have been found in sand and ice as well.<br />Deem and Kelly do a fine job of explaining why there are so many myths about mummies and do an excellent job of explaining how mummies GOT that way in the first place.  The long and complicated process of Egyptian mummification (which often took 70 days or longer) is well explained here, as are the natural processes at work for what might be called \\"accidental\\" mummies:  people like the Iceman who froze to death but were preserved by natural forces.<br />Mummies have been misunderstood throughout history, and often denied the respect they deserve--during the 1800's mummies were bought and ground up as medicine!  It's high time that this change.  A good way to instigate some of this change is to get this book and read it!  Practically every student is at least passingly interested in mummies.

But he DOES have a fertile imagination and an uncanny gift to \\"stump the dummy\\" as we say in educational circles:  ask that PERFECT question at JUST the right time during class that will make the teacher go off-track and waste time.<br />Well, that is, he's able to do that until he meets up with Mrs. Granger, the language arts teacher of his elementary school.  Mrs. G. is something of a filtration system, or perhaps a gatekeeper:  you want to go to middle school?  You've got to go through HER and her class!!  An early attempt to get The Lone Granger off-task and into the proverbial weeds (in an attempt to avoid getting a boring homework assignment) by asking her how words get into the dictionary only succeeds in earning him a research project on the very topic.  Mrs. G is not a force to be trifled with.<br />In another attempt to derail the rushing train of language arts education, he asks WHY words mean what they do??  Very simple:  words mean what they do because collections of people AGREE that they have that meaning.  On a walk home from school, inspiration strikes:  what if one was to call a pen something else...  Something like \\"frindle\\"??  What would happen then??<br />You can, of course, just imagine.  Like most catchy slang, \\"frindle\\" spreads like a virus among the 5th grade, and within a couple of chapters, the school, the town, the state and even the NATION is calling pens frindles.  What's even MORE important is that no one seems to REMEMBER the word \\"pen\\" anymore, and most folk don't care, either.<br />\\"Frindle\\" incorporates all of the fine elements of young adult fiction:  it's believable enough to draw readers in immediately; it's got the conflict of Good vs. Evil (Nick vs. his teacher, ol' Mrs. G); and it has the Clever Kid who Puts One Over On the Stodgy Grownups.<br />Of course, what's more is that \\"Frindle\\" can oh-so-easily lend itself to Serious Discussion about etymology, slang, and word usage.  English is perhaps one of the most vivid, fluid and fastest growing of the world's spoken tongues, and yet most students find the study of it dry, tasteless and booooring.  \\"Frindle\\", in addition to being a fine read, is a great way to get kids thinking!!<br />Read this book!!bout etymology, slang, and word usage.

Stories about  the writing process and books on how to write better are abundant (even as  an elementary school teacher, I was required to take a course in which we  intensely studied the whole process and history of writing from Plato to  Derrida).  No one is arguing that there isn't enough to read, but of the  books written, especially fiction, rarely is there a glimpse of the whole  world that goes on behind the writing itself.<br />Enter  &quot;Intrusions&quot;, a truly remarkable novel where we get into  EVERYONE'S head, including the author's.  &quot;Intrusions&quot; begins  almost immediately with the unabashed acknowledgement that you (the person  reading the book) is reading the book.  That is, from the very beginning  the author establishes early on that this is a book and the main character  is a woman named Megan. The author is writing the book as it unfolds, NOW,  with life going on around her all the time.  Her children (the author's,  not Megan's) interrupt her at her typewriter demanding attention, lunch,  Popsicles, trips to the playground, etc.<br />Megan's children similarly  intrude upon HER, demanding her time, her attention.  Megan's husband has  his own set of demands as well, mostly advice on what he should wear to  work and what he wants for breakfast (Megan is not a big on fixing  breakfast).  Against this background of characters she's created who have  their own lives unfolding we also see the author's unfold.<br />Soon, author  and characters begin intruding on each other and each other's lives:  one  day the author (who is not identified and therefore might be Hegi or might  be another character she's invented) strikes up a conversation with Megan.  Megan, like so many female characters, has lived a sheltered life, and is  beginning to think that there is more to life than what she's been getting.  This leads the author into the first of a series of fascinating  arguments/conversations with her own characters.<br />Soon, the author and her  characters are with each other all the time, even when the author tries to  leave them be.  Megan's husband intermittently appears to the author  demanding different treatment of Megan, rewrites of his chapters, nips and  tucks in the plot. All the while the author is dealing with the very real  intrusions of her own children, husband and life as well as the guilt-laden  intrusions of her characters who want both for the author to give them  autonomy and to script their lives in a favorable way.<br />For readers who  are used to an even flow of text and plot, this book may seem chaotic,  choppy or even poorly written-- the chapters are often short, everyone's  talking to each other, and most of us are not used to authors who freely  talk to their characters *in the book.*  We may expect authors to privately  &quot;talk&quot; to their characters while writing, but rarely does the  author jump right into the narrative itself and tell us, the reader, what  is going on in their private, authorly lives at the moment of writing.<br />But the act of intrusion is constant and in everything-- I myself have  had intruded on my own writing for this review to do 2 loads of laundry,  eat dinner and was *intruded upon* by a phone call.  Just like majestic  cathedrals or skyscrapers that are wonders to behold once they're finished  but take a long time to build, great books take time to build.  Where most  books are like finished buildings that the reader tours and admires,  &quot;Intrusions&quot; is like a masterpiece in the making-- we get to  experience the author taking steps back to make sure that the building is  going according to plan.  At then end, then, is when we, the readers, can  lookboth back at all that has been accomplished and admire what has been  created.can  look both back at all that has been accomplished and admire what has been  created.	2000-04-03

You may not know the name, but believe me, you'd recognize the art style at a glance.  His furious, spastic pen-and-ink drawings laced with blown inks and blots of thick black-- as if someone  snuck up behind him and yelled BOO! and his pen nib got frightened and let  loose-- have been featured in perhaps every magazine and graced the covers  of more than just his own books (the old cover for &quot;Fear and  Loathing&quot; by Hunter S. Thompson comes to mind...).  What's fascinating  is the amount of books he has written himself.<br />With such a jumbled style  of illustration, you might find it odd that he's written a childrens' book.  Published in Australia in 1989 and currently out of print in the States,  it exists in &quot;No Room to Swing a Cat.&quot;<br />Our tale opens when our  hero, Tom, announces that his room is too small (hardly surprising  considering it's stuffed to the gills with blocks, cars, checkerboards,  stuffed animals-- including a moose and dinosaur-- and Tom himself).  His  mother asks what he means, and Tom says that it's not even big enough to  swing a cat in.  NOTE:  Tom doesn't WANT to swing a cat in it, he's merely  pointing out that you CANNOT swing a cat in it-- a distinction that should  probably be made to children who get this book read to them.<br />Thereafter  ensues some Steadmanian fun-- mainly two page spreads of Tom swinging  various animals to his mother's enquiry of how big his room SHOULD be.  &quot;Big enough to swing a pig?&quot; his mother asks, and there on the  page is a teeny Tom swinging a large, stunned looking pig by the tail.  Tom  goes through a number of different animals, each getting larger and more  ridiculous looking as they're being swung, until it's revealed that he  want's his room big enough for HIM to swing in.  At which point he and his  mother go outside to Tom's swingset.<br />If you've seen Steadman's artwork,  you'll know it's quite chaotic and sometimes almost sinister-looking.  Big  blobs of ink are splattered pell-mell across the canvas; if the ink were  red, you might think he had been brained right there at his easel.  Tom  himself is depicted with a big frown-- a simple upside-down semicircle line  across his face that gives him a somewhat haunted look.  For the last  decade or so, the trend in children's books have been towards self-esteem  and conflict resolution and away from chaotic illustrations of cockeyed  kids whizzing stunned dogs around over their heads.  The British phrase use  as the title and genesis of the book may be enough for many people to pass  up the chance to search for this one, but I personally don't see much harm  in it.<br />Firstly, most of the animals Tom flails about are already taking  up space in his room at the very beginning of the book, and it seems  reasonable to me that any room that you can't successfully swing a stuffed  moose in IS too small.<br />Secondly, for older children it can help to  explain the complex world of adult phrases and simile (&quot;guerrilla  warfare&quot; was the one that always stumped me when I was a child; I had  visions of half-man, half-ape creatures fighting it out with American  soldiers).<br />Finally, in a world where children have ready access to  handguns and Pokemon has our preschoolers running amok pretending to shock,  zap or burn each other to cinders, the amusing (if queerly drawn) pictures  of one child swinging a stuffed elephant around to show how small his room  is pales by comparison.Big  blobs of ink are splattered pell-mell across the canvas; if the ink were  red, you might think he had been brained right there at his easel.

That is, emotionally speaking, if one were to cut him open, there would be nothing inside.  Rather like a hollow Easter bunny, he's all surface:  just a sweet, cute, sugary shell that is almost completely devoid  of anything of substance.  Like chocolate, too much of him would likely be  bad for you, making you break out and get tummy aches.  Fortunately,  however, no one does bother to get too much of Nick.<br />Nick is a party  promoter, a hand model and, when you get down to it, a hack.  He is  obsessed with, consumed by and interested only in what he calls  &quot;hotness&quot;-- beautiful female models.  Nick's purpose in life--  his destiny, you might say-- lies in the quest for these models, which he  generically labels as &quot;Thing&quot; (which, it should be noted, is both  singular and plural).  His interest isn't in promoting them for fun and  profit-- Nick is not a rich man and isn't likely to be one at the rate he's  going-- his interest lies in getting next to thing, showing off in public  with her on his arm and, in the final analysis, getting Thing into  bed.<br />Nick may not be very intellectual, he may not be smart in the  academic fashion, he may freely admit to being The Shallow Man, but when it  comes to landing Thing, you're dealing with genius when you deal with Nick.  He knows the hangouts, he knows the dialogue, he knows when to shut up  (very rare in &quot;Guy&quot;-- another Nick term for the average male  running about)-- and he's got a watertight plan to get with every variation  (however few) of Thing.  Thing is what he lives for.<br />Oddly enough, he is  not without his mores and scruples.  He feels genuine concern (however  brief) for new Thing entering the business, he has a friend he nicknames  the Catsuit Feminist whom he does NOT actively sleep with (most of us would  call this &quot;friendship&quot;) and he refuses to resort to drugging or  paying Thing to be with him...  Not that this is necessary, however.<br />At  only one point does he seem to swim to the surface, take in a gulp of  reality and realize that he's in his 30's, hardly making any money, and his  prospects in the business-- though better than female Thing who does not  age as gracefully as males--  are going to get poorer and thinner as he  gets older.<br />As noted, the book is out of print.  This is actually a  shame considering that the book, copyright 1995, is as timely and scathing  now as it was then, perhaps even MORE so considering how younger (and  usually thinner) models are appearing on the scene daily, and the  proliferation of high-gloss fashion magazines with Thing prominently  displayed on their covers.<br />&quot;The Shallow Man&quot; is likely to  offend some, titillate others, and make others moan in disgust at an  industry that so easily makes hangers-on and parasites (however likable)  such as Nick laws.  It is not, however, likely to bore anyone.paying Thing to be with him...

The trend in science education today (long overdue, IMHO), is for hands-on.  The closer the student can get to some form of manipulation of whatever they're studying, the better they'll learn the material.  Gone or going, thankfully, are the days of the 'sage on stage' teacher who stands  at the head of the class dispensing nuggets of wisdom for the students to  eagerly gobble up (not that there was EVER that much eager gobbling going  on...).<br />Hence, in many contemporary classrooms, there is move away from  the color-the-worksheet-on-the- life-cycle-of-the-tadpole technique, and an  introduction OF a real-life tadpole into the classroom itself (which,  arguably, has GOT to be more interesting).<br />So, OUT go the pictures of  worms and grasshoppers, and IN come the real insects themselves.  One  problem:  what to do with the lil' nippers (the animals, not the students)  once the science lesson is over.  In the past, most classroom animals and  insects have either been released on the playground or given a &quot;burial  at sea&quot; in the staff restroom after school is done for the day.<br />Not  necessary now, thanks to Mr. Dunlap.  Covering a VERY broad spectrum of  living creatures, from ants and worms to much larger creatures like mice  &amp; turtles, Mr. Dunlap not only informs the reader how to humanely  &quot;reintroduce&quot; the specimen into the wild, he also provides the  reader with some even MORE important information:  how to keep the  animal/insect ALIVE while it's IN the classroom (what heating elements are  best for what type of lizards, e.g., what moss is best for earthworms).  THIS may, for some classrooms and students, be the major selling point of  the book--how best to keep Timmy's prize salamander he found during recess  alive during it's week in residence in the classroom without it getting  sick or dying.<br />While written primarily for teachers and classrooms, it is  by no means ONLY for these environments.  Families with children who are  curious about the natural world (and who frequently collect little  &quot;pets&quot; from the back yard or garden--I had a friend who's 3 year  old had a pet slug for two days) will find this book not only useful, but  very educational as well.who are  curious about the natural world (and who frequently collect little  &quot;pets&quot; from the back yard or garden--I had a friend who's 3 year  old had a pet slug for two days) will find this book not only useful, but  very educational as well.	2000-03-06

What, exactly, HiTek produces--if anything--is shrouded in mystery (one is almost reminded of &quot;Memoirs  found in a Bathtub&quot; by Lem, or perhaps even an upbeat Kafka), but it's  abundantly clear it's got it's share of modern problems.  Chief among them  are paperwork and a catastrophically incompetent, branded, multi-color  mohawked, duct tape-wearing, glorified mail clerk named Flip.<br />As the  story opens (and progresses, and even ends), Sandra is researching  trends--especially WHY they start and, in her mind, why they're usually of  little or no significance to humanity:  &quot;why doesn't thinking for  oneself or being nice for a change ever become a trend?&quot; she wonders  (for myself, I finished the book in the food court of the local mall and  found myself wondering about the current trends of clunky-heeled shoes,  floppy-legged jeans and Mendi bracelets/necklaces).  Through a series of  random events, the initus being a misdelivered package by the oft-promoted  but never competent Flip, she is brought into contact with a chaos theorist  who is so UN-trendy that a friendship is immediately formed (note:  Dr. Ben  is not ANTI-trend, as Sandra quickly points out, like the hippies growing  long hair in protest of the short buzzcuts of the 50's, but seems IMMUNE to  them).<br />At first, she is merely curious as to why he, of all people,  seems so impervious to trends, and then discovers--in a flurry of  ridiculous but easily recognized management and social trends--that chaos  theory and the sociology of trends are actually much more linked than  either of them had originally thought.  That is, until Flip looses Dr.  Ben's funding form (and, of course, Management believes the claim of the  mohawked, duct taped lackey that she never GOT it), and enter the sheep,  stage left...<br />As an amateur student of sociology, I personally loved the  book and the fun it poked at modern society.  However, sometimes Ms.  Willis's character's fads DID get a bit out of hand, and the trends in the  book seemed TOO trendy.  Flip, of course, being a main character SHOULD  have the latest trend, like putting swatches of duct tape around a brand of  the letter &quot;I&quot; between her eyes and going off on an anti-smoking  campaign.  However, when EVERYONE starts rolling their eyes, flipping their  hair, and sporting swatches of tape just like Flip-and I mean EVERYONE-the  book looses some of it's realism.  Even within trends, there's got to be  room for individual variation (like KAKHI pants that completely cover the  wearer's shoes vs. denim).  Also, sometimes my reality got in the way of  the book.  For example, as &quot;Dilbertian&quot; as HiTek may be as a  company, and though I know first hand and through the works of Mr. Scott  Adams that MOST companies, no matter how big or small, have complete  dunderheads making decisions, it took me the longest time to be convinced  that Flip--with her appearance alone, to say nothing of her inability to do  her work, etc--would ever be EMPLOYED by any large company, let alone  PROMOTED...

I ESPECIALLY recommend it to anyone who has ever gone  to the mall and wondered why on earth people (especially teens who, like  sheep, tend to travel in tight herds and follow their own bellwether) feel  the need to do what everyone else is doing.	2000-02-24

At the outset of the book, he tries a game of his own devising--acting just like his father. This entails getting very drunk on whiskey, walking around  in his underwear and verbally abusing his mother to the neighbors.  Neighbors who start not seeing the amusement when Steven's mother arrives  and attempts to drag him home, especially when Steven begins to hit his  mother just like his dad would. The object of the game, after all, is to be  exactly like his father.<br />His father comes home, brutally beats him, and  from this moment on, the sad and unusual life of Steven Jones gets even  more sad, unusual and disturbed. While he is being beaten he comes to  realize something: his father has actually beaten him to death, there is a  teeny-tiny little boy inside of him--&quot;Hi, I'm Kevin&quot;--and though  Steven Jones is dead, there is an invisible presence around this new  Kevin-child, and that presence is both himself-who-once-was-Steven and  Kev's father.<br />This presence-around-Kev moves the dead Steven Jones's body  through the daily routine of living and going to school, but physically  does little else. Instead, the narrator (for he does not identify as Steven  anymore, Steven was beaten to death by his father in a drunken rage, we are  reminded) plays games and spins fantastic stories to Kev, who is a very  little boy that will never grow up. These stories, which the narrator knows  as both false lies and honest truths, tell the stories of how the body of  Steven Jones and Kev and the narrator are made to live in the Land of Worms  where everyone is separate from everyone else.<br />If this weren't disturbing  enough, after a period of years of basically existing (one is hard pressed  to say &quot;living&quot;) with Kev, suddenly the narrator stumbles upon  one of the town's outcast, Clara, who apparently is able to see into  Steven's body and see Kev. Both the story and the narrator's life take a  turn for the unexpected and horrific when Kev leaves Steven's body and goes  to visit, and then live with, Clara. Clara--known to Kev and the narrator  as Mara--is in fact Kev's mother.<br />The book is one of those rare ones that  make a sort of perfect, twisted sense while reading, but is almost  impossible to coherently tell someone else about who's not read it. Indeed,  the blurb on the inside of the dust jacket totally failed to interest or  inform me about the book, and if I didn't just start reading--and get  pulled in from page #1--I doubt I would have bothered to read it.<br />Mr.  Black takes us into a very strange realm where, like the narrator, we  suddenly can see things as true, false, and sometimes both at the same  time--writing with both the black and red part of the typewriter ribbon, as  it were. At once it feels like this is a story about the narrator suffering  from untreated schizophrenia, and then, in a twinkling-- like the times  when Mara talks about things she couldn't have known about, things Kev told  her about the narrator's life or thoughts--it's a story that is almost  paranormal in it's creepiness.<br />I know some folk who likely wouldn't enjoy  the book--too weird, too mind-twisty for their taste. But, if breaking us  out of our habits-- getting us to shake off the coating of dust that  settles on us through our days--is what a writer's job is, then Mr. Black  has succeeded phenomenally well.tor's life take a  turn for the unexpected and horrific when Kev leaves Steven's body and goes  to visit, and then live with, Clara.

Simon, who lives on a palatial estate with his sister and the shell-shocked  housekeeper, Marion, has secretly dug tunnels beneath the grounds. These  tunnels-- his hide-- are both for hiding himself from a confusing and  vicious world, and to take voyeuristic peeks at his surroundings--  especially the woman in the next house who has a penchant for housework in  flimsy garments.<br />Josh enters the household as a gardener when Simon's  sister, Audry, decides in her unilateral way that the estate needs upkeep.  Josh finds himself both disturbed by these odd hermits on the enormous  estate and slowly attracted to Marion.  Simon, for his part, is appalled  and terrified of Josh-- a stranger, and worse, a gardener who has access to  the grounds and may discover his hide, to say nothing of seeing Simon  sneaking in and out of all his secret spots in the overgrown hedges.<br />The  book is entirely engrossing, yet disturbing and sad. Everyone in the book  seems broken in some way, limping through life in an unaware, self-piteous  sort of rut where nothing ever happens. They are reflexive-things happen TO  them, they are not capable, it seems, of exerting any force in their  worlds. Simon is obsessed with his tunnels and spying, and in the process  of spending so much time alone and underground, has no clear idea how to  deal with other adults.  Because of this, he does some startlingly childish  pranks that he promptly regrets.  He is perpetually tongue-tied and  overanalytical of every social situation, almost always saying the wrong  thing at the wrong time, all the while longing to escape to his secret  subterranean realm.<br />Josh is a meek, lost, confused little Cockney who  only seems to have a will of his own-- small and fragile as it may be--  when he is not hanging about with his best friend Mortimer. Mortimer, who  is older and much more assured, can bend Josh to his will as easily as  wrapping picture-hanger wire around his finger. Josh seems to know this and  often vows NOT to tell Mortimer EVERYTHING that happens on the estate-- to  keep some secrets to himself or save them for later-- only to have it  easily prized out of him within moments of meeting Mortimer.<br />Throw this  gaggle of sad, wizened-soul creatures together in one large, overgrown  estate, toss in the oh-too-human drive for companionship and sex, mix  together (the contents will separate at first), and let stand until a  rickety triangle between Marion, Josh and Audrey forms and you have the  basic recipe for this astonishing book.nd much more assured, can bend Josh to his will as easily as  wrapping picture-hanger wire around his finger.

Most houses have the same things in them:  beds, bathtubs, closets, floors, stairs, windows, kitchen sinks.  Most of these things, especially utilitarian objects like  walls, floors, windows and ceilings, are so common as to hardly garner any  attention whatsoever unless they are falling into disrepair.  We see them  all the time when indoors, but their presence hardly registers on our  consciousness  (babies, for example, stare at the ceiling a good deal of  the time, but the word &quot;ceiling&quot; is hardly important enough to  us-as is the ceiling itself-to teach it to them first).<br />Mr. Thorne  isn't convinced that these mundane objects are as mundane as we may  collectively think they are.  Through a series of short chapters that cover  the gamut of things in and of a typical house--The Keyhole, The Floor, The  Bed, the Closet-- he puts the typical dwelling under the microscope and  takes another look at the things we all LOOK at, but don't really  SEE.<br />It's a fascinating exploration of the everyday, seen through a  different lens than the one we normally use to view our world.  I, for one,  haven't thought about the shape of the bathtub since childhood.  But, after  reading Home Body, I now look at it differently, much the way I did when I  was a child.  Back then (as Mr. Thorne reminded me), the tub resembled some  sort of reverse boat-where the curved sides, like a hull, held the water  IN, instead of keeping it OUT.  The further irony of floating a toy boat on  the water inside this bathtub-boat is something I've not thought about in  years, having used the bathtub for it's purpose of getting clean in recent  history.<br />While not written from a childlike perspective, Home Body does  have a lilting, poetical, imaginative turn of phrase for even the most  mundane objects in the home.  For example, dust: &quot;Dust, like madness,  blindness, moral decay, doesn't appear out of the blue with the sudden  violence of a summer storm.  It drifts down softly, an incessant,  imperceptible sift.&quot;<br />Indeed.sudden  violence of a summer storm.

If you're a porcupine with back full of cowlick-ey quills, &quot;Fluffy&quot; sure ain't it.  When Mr. &amp; Mrs. Porcupine had their first child, they were thrilled to pieces, but needed a name for  their progeny.  Lance, Prickles, Quillan and Needleroozer are all summarily  rejected when suddenly inspiration strikes:  &quot;Let's call him Fluffy.  It's such a pretty name.  Fluffy!&quot;<br />Well, suffice it to say Fluffy is  anything but. He manages to get stuck in a door by backing into it (his dad  hangs his hat on Fluffy's nose), poke holes in his umbrella and stick  himself to his mattress...  Definitely UN-fluffy things to do.<br />Like  anyone who has been burdened with a less-than-optimal title (and who HASN'T  disliked their own name sometime? ), Fluffy decides to try to live up to  his handle.  The power of positive thinking doesn't work that well--trying  to be a fluffy cloud or pillow only produces a not-so-pleased mother who  sits on him by accident, and the tree won't support his weight.  Similarly,  attempts to fluff up his quills by soaking in the tub for 45 minutes,  covering himself with whipped cream and eating fluffy marshmallows only  manages to make him soggy, gooey and stuffed. &quot;The truth remained.  Fluffy wasn't.&quot;<br />However, solidarity and a new perspective on life  suddenly arrive when Fluffy meets a grumpy rhinoceros.  At first, the rhino  promises to give Fluffy a hard time, but soon is rolling on the ground in  gales of laughter when he finds that he's just met a porcupine named  Fluffy.  An embarrassed but polite Fluffy the porcupine asks the rhino what  HIS name is.  It's &quot;Hippo.&quot;  The book ends with the two, now  friends, rolling around in hysterics at the fun absurdity of a porcupine  called Fluffy and a rhino called Hippo.<br />Ms. Lester and Ms. Munsinger have  collaborated to produce a wonderful, bright and amusing book on a subject  that will affect practically every child at some point--their name.  Most  children will endure some sort of taunt about their name sometime in their  early life, and in an age long before the pressures of day-to-day life  settle in, having a name you feel doesn't really fit you can be  devastating.  I personally remember constantly inventing new and flashy  names for myself to avoid the dreaded moniker of my first name, which was  usually half-whined, half-yelled at me by my mother when she was trying to  triangulate my position within the house.<br />The illustrations are fantastic  and really very funny despite the levity of the subject matter--Fluffy with  his striped mattress impaled half on his head as he gets out of bed is one  of my personal favorites.  In addition to being simply fun to read, it is a  most worthwhile book for children of all ages who feel that perhaps their  parents could have tried a LITTLE harder to come up with a title that would  fit them better.t--their name.

Toot &amp; Puddle are perfect porcine pals who, in their delicate way, teach us all that sometimes we're just out of alignment and that's OK.<br />On a beautiful, sun-shining morning in Woodcock Pocket, Puddle was out  catching butterflies.  The sun was shining, birds singing, flowers blooming  and... Well, in the house, Toot was moping.<br />Like anyone who's ever had an  off day, Toot can't quite explain what's the matter, nor does he  particularly *feel* like explaining.  SOMETHING'S clearly the matter,  Puddle and Tulip the parrot can see that, because nothing seems to cheer  him up--not the blue sky, not the clean air, not even &quot;five-berry  cobbler with heaps of whipped cream...&quot;  Well, the cobbler HELPS a  bit, but the next day Toot comes shuffling across the yard, hands stuffed  in pockets, floppy hat with equally floppy ears sticking out,  half-heartedly kicking some stones.<br />His friends try to cheer him up.  An adventure seems in order, but white water rafting proves to be not quite  the right medicine for melancholy.  Similarly, a picnic with friends and a  game of hide-&amp;-seek is fun for everyone except for Toot, who isn't in  the mood to be &quot;it&quot;.  In short, nothing works and Puddle and  Tulip are getting concerned, when a thunderous storm hits.<br />Toot, who is  the only one who is NOT afraid, is out braving the storm in his yellow rain  slicker on a beautiful 2-page illustration that itself makes the book worth  reading.  Lo', the next morning, a happy, smiling Toot comes marching  through the puddles towards his friends who, lying in the grass, conclude  that &quot;sometimes you need a big whopping thunderstorm to clear the  air.&quot;<br />While &quot;You are My Sunshine&quot; doesn't have quite the  flow or action of &quot;A Present for Toot&quot;, it is an immensely  enjoyable book (I personally recommend collecting all three of Ms. Hobbie's  works, and any more books to come).  The pen &amp; ink illustrations are  astounding, and capture the feel of the character moods instantly.  The  blue sky, Puddle's exuberant jump with a butterfly net, frame his joy at  simply being ALIVE on a wonderful day as much as the muted golds &amp;  yellows of Toot's room captures his moping, tired affect perfectly.

Items such as addresses, phone numbers, and amenities  of each club are meticulously detailed.  So, if you're looking for a camp  with a heated pool, tennis courts, sauna or snack bar, you'll easily find  it herewithin.<br />Like many naturist/nudist publications, the book starts  off with a brief intro about naturist/nudist lifestyles and why anyone  would enjoy or consider a nude vacation.  It is NOT a book outlining the  social/political or health reasons for going nude, nor are the pictures  within titillating or erotic (just like nude resorts-my favorite quote:  \\"one nude draped on a divan is erotic; 100 nudes in line for potato salad  are NOT\\").  It is an extremely detailed and well-researched guide to  clothing free recreational areas; oh that TEXTILE CAMP GUIDES should be  this thorough!<br />While no beaches are highlighted in this book (there is a  WORLD guide for that), it is a perfect starting point for anyone  considering a nude vacation.	1999-12-12

From there, they began to integrate  themselves into the culture and lives of the Plain Folk, winning their  trust and sharing in their lives.<br />The book is a collection of stunningly  beautiful photographs of this area and collections and excerpts of sayings,  proverbs and songs used as worship.  The color photographs are plain  themselves, like the people they chronicle, but contain a profundity that  is difficult to translate into words.  For example, I'm looking at a  photograph, probably taken near dusk or just after sunrise, of a windmill  against a darkening sky.  There is a tree next to the windmill, and it's  branches are bare.  Puffy, dissolving cumulus clouds are lazing their way  across the photo, and the general effect is one of immense calm.  It's the  very sort of photo that, despite the sparse content, makes me want to look  at it, drink it in, for hours.  To think that this calm scene is no doubt  an everyday sight makes my life seem chaotic, busy and loud.<br />The book is  full of photographs like this one, some almost humorous.  In one picture,  approximately 15 or 20 buggies are lined up, sans horses, in a field with  their bright red, triangular \\"slow moving vehicle\\" sign attached to the  back.  But, not so far away in the background are two tall grain silos,  slightly blurry and dulled of color with the distance.  The ground is brown  and the trees bear no leaves.  It's a deeply calming scene.  At once it is  both a haunting and warm image that makes the typical photograph of a more  urban area seem almost debase and wretched, where people are rushing to and  fro on \\"endless idiocies\\", as Orwell would put it.<br />Similarly, the songs  and prayers, sayings and proverbs are also simple-Plain.  Just to choose  one at random, \\"Appetite comes with eating; the more you eat, the more you  want.  -Amish farmer's proverb\\".  The accompanying photograph is of a corn  crib with dulled yellow cobs half under a pile of snow.<br />The overall  effect of the book has been, for me, one of calm stillness, a mood that  makes me look around at all the piles of silly JUNK I've got stacked up, of  all the preposterous advertisements blaring at me from television, radio  and newspapers, and makes me wonder why do I HAVE all this stuff?  It's an  effect that makes me want to sweep away the flotsam and jetsam of my life  and concentrate on what is REALLY important to me.br />Similarly, the songs  and prayers, sayings and proverbs are also simple-Plain.

SOMETHING exciting MUST be going on downstairs!  After all, why else would SHE have to go to bed and her PARENTS not?  Why, it's just plain unfair!  Her parents are  probably down there RIGHT NOW, just waiting for her to sleep so they can  throw a huge party without her!<br />Or so the young lady who is at the  center of this story is convinced.  So, if you can't beat 'em, INFILTRATE!  Trying a whole battery of stealthy and sometimes sneaky techniques, she  attempts to make her way downstairs to find out just what IS going on down  there!  She tries every trick in the book, from just plain sneaking out of  her room to the ol' I-Need-to-go-to-the-Bathroom trick (which, it is noted,  has been tried the whole world over!).  Still, nothing works.  The giant  binoculars made out of cardboard tubes proves to be ineffective (though  sharp eyed parental readers may note the headline on the father's newspaper  that yells &quot;CHILD STAYS IN BED!  HISTORY MADE! &quot;) as does the  Drink of Water Technique.<br />At one point, our heroine DOES manage to get  downstairs, only to have her suspicions confirmed!  AH HA!  Dad's dressed  up in a wizard costume and Mom is hanging streamers from the celing!<br />What?  Oh...  Dad's just dressed in his P.J.s and Mom is flossing her  teeth...  You mean NOTHING happens after she goes to bed?  Where the heck is  the the party!<br />This is a wonderful book, both for children who  can<br />identify with a young child who hates to go to bed, as well as any  parent who HAS a child who hates to go to bed and is convinced they're  missing out on something. The illustrations are simple, very colorful and  often simply hysterical (the picture of the girl dragging herself across  the bedroom floor, eyes crossed and tongue hanging out for a glass of water  is one of my personal favorites).  Ms. Davis has created a small  masterpiece.  Highly recommended.	1999-12-12

Personally, I'm glad to see that board books are finally coming into their own and receiving professional, editorial reviews!  Too often, board books play a very distant 2nd fiddle to their larger (and longer) kin, the  picture books.<br />I've read a good deal of board books in my time, and have  found that while there are vast numbers of them, some are just plain poorly  written or illustrated-I fancy because people feel that they're only being  given to very young children, so what's the big deal?<br />It IS a big deal,  and Mr. Yaccarino does an excellent job with this work.  Based on a popular  fingerplay (hold up 5 fingers and sing/say the rhyme), the book is likely  to already be familiar to most infants &amp; toddlers, especially around  Halloween time.  The illustrations are bold, very bright oils that capture  the playful spirit of the fingerplay and the text is a big, bold,  easy-to-read non-serif font that fully compliment the story (all too often,  the text in board books is difficult to read or distinguish different  letter shapes &amp; patterns).<br />Our five little pumpkins, each with a  different expression that stays constant throughout the book, begin by  sitting on a gate as an impish ghost floats out of a chimney on a house in  the background.  The sun is setting, and it's time for some fun!<br />The  pumpkins see witches in the air, talk with each other, and even get juggled  by the ghost, who seems to be having the most fun.  Children can practice  mastery at color identification-&quot;what color is the grass? &quot;-and  emotions-&quot;can you find the sad pumpkin? &quot;-as well as simply gain  fine motor skills by handling the toddler-sized book and turning the thick  pages.  I work for a literacy outreach program, and highly recommend this  book for both our program and for parents/caregivers who are scouting about  for quality board books.	1999-12-09

Silly Goose &amp; Dizzy Duck are very good friends (one is put in mind of Ernie &amp; Bert of Sesame St. fame or Toot &amp; Puddle by Hobbie).  They  are, however, not the brightest bulbs in the waterfowl chandelier, and so  when they take a walk and find Clever Fox following them, they  automatically assume he wants to play hide &amp; seek.<br />This leads to some  absolutely hysterical situations as Duck and Goose try to hide while Fox  (with a wide grin and pointy teeth) counts to five.  Goose tries a hollow  log, but is too fat.  Meanwhile, Duck tries to climb a tree, but realizes  he's afraid of heights.  A holly bush proves to be too prickly and the  river too cold.  In final desperation, Goose &amp; Duck hide in a pile of  leaves and behind a pile of rocks.<br />Children of all ages will undoubtedly  find these preposterous hiding places very funny, especially as Clever  fox--tongue licking his lips--zeros in on duck's hiding spot, prominently  exposed by Duck's elevated, feathered rump as he attempts to hide amongst a  pile of rocks much smaller than he.<br />When Fox has Duck in a gentle  throttle (Duck is smiling, but his tongue is sticking out of his orange  bill), he turns to find that a new player has joined the game, Grizzly  BEAR!  &quot;BOOOO! Boomed Grizzly Bear.&quot;  And that, as they say, is  that!  Fox runs off, arms akimbo, leaving Goose and Duck to be a bit miffed  at Bear who &quot;'frightened our friend', grumbled Silly Goose.  'And  spoiled our game,' said Dizzy Duck.  'You'll have to play  instead.'&quot;<br />Ms. Grindley &amp; Mr. Reynolds have produced a  masterpiece of the very sort of slapstick that young children thrive on.  The clear, uncluttered illustrations of wide-eyed waterfowl searching for  hiding places against the clock made me laugh right out loud.  The text is  bold, big and easy to read.  In addition, the text is arranged graphically  in such a way that the very words add to the story.  &quot;Booo! &quot; for  example, consisting of systematically smaller italicized type and  &quot;leaped into the air&quot; being bent up and down in a semicircle to  illustrate movement will not only guide parents/caregivers on how to read  the story, but will encourage children to pay more attention to the text  itself than they might otherwise do if the text sat on the page in a more  static manner.e, consisting of systematically smaller italicized type and  &quot;leaped into the air&quot; being bent up and down in a semicircle to  illustrate movement will not only guide parents/caregivers on how to read  the story, but will encourage children to pay more attention to the text  itself than they might otherwise do if the text sat on the page in a more  static manner.	1999-12-09

It's actually the dog who is telling the story.  Quips he-- &quot;That's right, I'm a talking dog.  It's a magical story.  (You didn't  say anything when that pig was talking in that movie... quiet!)&quot;<br />Rev.  Knight, in addition to having 12 sons (and presumably a very full house and  schedule) also has a problem:  every night his sons go to sleep but wake up  to find their shoes completely worn out.  After a rotating slew of  housekeepers fails to solve the mystery, radiant housekeeper Sunday moves  in.  As it turns out, the boys are sneaking out via a secret door in their  very loooong bed with the aid of a pointy-eared fellow called the Cookie  Man.<br />Once out of bed-- and out of the locked bedroom-- they proceed on  to Big Band Ballroom where everyone dances the night away...  Including  Sunday, who has donned her special cloak of invisibility.<br />The story is  both a retelling of &quot;The 12 Dancing Princesses&quot; and based on live  performances at Kennedy center.  However, it left ME (admittedly an adult  who may be inclined to ask more probing questions than a younger audience)  a bit curious.  Secret door in the bed?  The Cookie Man?  Invisible  cloak?  Twelve sons and no mother?  Dancing at the Big Band Ballroom all  night?  The story flows, but leaves me feeling like the author is telling  the story to an audience who already knows more history of these folk than  I do.<br />The brothers, for example, have wonderful names like Snacky, Lazy  Leo and Big Fat Raoul &quot;(likes to act a fool)&quot;, and obviously run  the gamut in age from 7-17, but we don't know anything about them other  than they like to dance (and I'm still curious as to how Rev. Knight GOT 12  sons-- adoption?  Biological?  Foster care?  Homeless youth?  What? ).  Similarly, Sunday, who arrives with her Mary Poppins-like suitcase that  holds a scarf of invisibility is not really well fleshed out, either.  As  for the Cookie Man, well...<br />The illustrations are simply amazing-- very  lively and eye catching, reason enough to get the book.  The language is  contemporary and easily paced--the dog tells us that Tiny Tappin' Theo's  dance partner ain't nearly as phat as that Irish setter down the street!  It's a lively story with a surprise ending, but I'd still like to know, in  more detail, who the main players are.l fleshed out, either.

Ms. Lucretzia Crum has a veritable potpourri of bad habits, including (but no doubt not limited to) burping, farting, spitting, yelling &amp; screaming.  Of course, because she can get away with all of these bad  habits, she is the envy of her classmates to do their best to emulate her  (one page shows Ms. Crum at school where, among other things, a well  dressed boy is releasing a large cloud from his nether end-complete with  the word &quot;poop!&quot;-and a frustrated, thoughtful teacher with green  apple bouncing off her head).<br />Her father is, of course, a mad scientist  who invents fantastically rediculous inventions to keep her under control,  like the &quot;burp-bung&quot; (a plunger-like invention placed over the  mouth), the &quot;thief-proof pullover&quot; (sweater with long sleeves  tied to bricks), and the &quot;Blowfart Inhaler Suit&quot; (consisting of a  rather overinflated astronaut suit complete with hose attaching the hind  end of the suit to the fishbowl helmet).<br />The illustrations are amusingly  preposterous and have a frenetic feel to them, which suits a main character  that destroys everything in her path.  When Ms. Crum's birthday party rolls  around and some REAL monsters enter, a whole LOT of destruction takes  place!!  Enough to scare Lucretzia right into being good!  Especially when  it is revealed that these monsters used to be children who ran amok just  like you-know-who...<br />As an educator, I can see how Bad Habits! would thrill  some children to the marrow-especially those who have a taste for bathroom  humor.  While I can see the slapstick of the Blowfart Inhaler Suit, I have  to report that the book is too over-the-top for my professional and  personal life (the pink monster with the giant buttocks instead of a head  who is constantly &quot;blowing off steam&quot; as it were is, for me, a  bit more than I'd like to expose my own child to).<br />Is it a GOOD book??  Yes, and most children 4-8 would enjoy it.  However, my fear is that they  would begin to EMULATE it as well.  Also, I have some difficulty with the  subtext:  how did Ms. Crum get to be so OLD without any discipline??  And  is the correct response to excessive intestinal gas a plunger or a  &quot;fartsuit&quot;??  Amusing, perhaps, but not the sort of book I would  recommend without some serious forethought.fear is that they  would begin to EMULATE it as well.

It's hard to top the pros reviews of &quot;Raising Dragons&quot;, and there's little else I can add other than to simply say get the book for your children... NOW.<br />The amazingly detailed and vibrant oils and  exuberant facial expressions of the main character will draw even the most  &quot;grumpafied&quot; (to borrow my daughter's term) and stodgy readers  (both young and old) right into the pages.  The cover art of Hank the  dragon being spoonfed some bright yellow...SOMETHING, is worth the price of  the book itself.  But don't stop at the cover!

Hedgehog plainly states that he won't miss Rabbit because he'll be  sleeping.  While Rabbit says he'll miss his friend, Hedgehog is bothered by  the fact that he doesn't know what winter IS-he sleeps through  it!<br />Hedgehog asks Rabbit to &quot;save a bit of winter for me&quot; and  writes a note on the bark of a tree to help Rabbit remember.  Problems  arise when winter hits and Rabbit, who usually eats pink clover and green  grass is reduced to eating brown things--including bark off trees with  MESSAGES written on them!<br />Well, fortunately, while Rabbit may be  scatterbrained, he remembers what Hedgehog wanted him to save, and manages,  with a bit of forest ingenuity, to save some winter for his sleeping  friend.<br />&quot;A Little Bit of Winter&quot; is a testament to friendship.  The precise illustrations and depth of expression make the characters feel  so very REAL, to children as well as adults.  One can simply FEEL Rabbit's  sadness and frustration at having to eat brown stuff, dig through mountains  of snow AND be lonely on top of everything else.  The joy both Hedgehog and  Rabbit feel when spring comes and they get to be together again is  infectious and radiant.<br />An excellent book, highly recommended.  Even if  you DON'T have children to give the book to, buy it and give it to  YOURSELF.	1999-08-20

My favorite lines from the book (p. 1-4):  &quot;These are chairs.  Patrick knew 101 different ways to sit in a chair.  Because he knew so many ways to sit in a chair, he  heard two words a lot... SIT STILL!&quot;<br />Sounds like my  autobiography...<br />Well, you can imagine that his difficulty in sitting  still has the tendency to upset all those around him who don't have this  problem (note:  MOST adults don't have trouble sitting still while many  children DO).  And yes, Pat DOES go to see the doctor.<br />In all fairness,  it's not stated anywhere that he has ADD, though one can easily imply this.  The doc doesn't pump him full o' Ritalin, and yes, the 101 different  things for Pat to do may be oversimplistic for children with ADD.  However,  there is a sad void of GOOD, non-clinical books for children who have  trouble sitting still, whether or not they DO have ADD (most of the one's  I've seen, like &quot;Shelley, the Hyperactive Turtle&quot; address  specific disorders in an overly lets-look-at-your-disorder sort of  way).<br />However, buyers should note that the book is not very  multicultural.  Pat and his traditional, nuclear family is White, and only  a half dozen, parenthetical characters who play no real role are of color.  Overall, though, the book is an excellent one and should NOT be limited  only to children who are diagnosed with ADD OR have trouble sitting still  all the time!	1999-08-20

Items such as addresses, phone numbers, and amenities  of each club are meticulously detailed.  So, if you're looking for a camp  with a heated pool, tennis courts, sauna or snack bar, you'll easily find  it herewithin.<br />Like many naturist/nudist publications, the book starts  off with a brief intro about naturist/nudist lifestyles and why anyone  would enjoy or consider a nude vacation.  It is NOT a book outlining the  social/political or health reasons for going nude, nor are the pictures  within titillating or erotic (just like nude resorts-my favorite quote:  \\"one nude draped on a divan is erotic; 100 nudes in line for potato salad  are NOT\\").  It is an extremely detailed and well-researched guide to  clothing free recreational areas; oh that TEXTILE CAMP GUIDES should be  this thorough!!<br />While no *beaches* are highlighted in this book (there is  a WORLD guide for that), it is a perfect starting point for anyone  considering a nude vacation.	1999-08-20

Using a childlike &quot;what if...??&quot; view of the world, the author takes commonplace items and puts them under the &quot;toddler microscope&quot;,  so to speak.  If flowers were the same color as grass, for example, would  bees still be interested in them??  If we change the color of this friendly  cat, would it still be so friendly??  If a boat was the same color as the  water, would it still float??  AND, most importantly, if I were a different  color, would you still like me??<br />The beautiful, Eric Carle-like cut paper  illustrations are worth the price of the book itself, but it's the message  and fun in the book that will make it a treasure worth reading again and  again.  WHAT IF we could change colors of ordinary, common things??  What  if the mailbox was Pleasing Purple instead of Boring Blue??  What if we  could change the sky to bubble gum pink??  What if, what if, what if...??<br />This line of thinking will appeal to young children, especially those  who, in their own artwork, find themselves entertaining Dr. Seussian  fantasy lands of orange oceans, green skys and purple-haired people.  The  chance to identify colors and shapes and objects will appeal to caregivers  and readers who want to introduce or evaluate color identification in young  children.  BUT, most of all, the last two pages where the author asks  about &quot;my&quot; color--&quot;what if I wasn't the color I was meant to  be/would you still be my friend?  Would you still like me?&quot;-- are the  most important ideas we can give to our children.	1999-08-20

Call me an old granny, call me a bleeding heart, call me cute as a button (to borrow from &quot;Cheers&quot;), but Ralph just doesn't do it for me.<br />I can see where  the average 7-9 year old (probably male) would find Ralph's antics  hysterical and most likely would secretly wish to do the same thing  THEMSELVES at a wedding party, but a good book does not this make.<br />One of  the things I find bothersome is that Ralph-- as per usual-- destroys  everything in his path WITH NO CONSEQUENCES WHATSOEVER.  The snails, the  ride down the aisle on the bride's dress, the knocking over the tent after  too much wedding cake (a coworker of mine read the book and exclaimed,  &quot;He's DRUNK!!&quot;); all of it Ralph does and not a single person  (almost all of whom are White-- the book isn't exactly a paradigm of  multiculturalism) chastises him for his behavior.<br />At the end, a tear in  her eye, Ralph's owner, Sarah, tells Ralph he's ruined everything (no  kidding!).  Ralph, in a co-dependent, enabling-like move, presents Sarah  with the bouquet he's caught and all is forgiven.<br />Maybe I'm being too  stodgy and humorless, but I feel that children are generally ALREADY  getting away with quite a bit without adult chastisement, so to hold up  Ralph as an example of how to ruin EVERYTHING and still be forgiven is not,  IMHO, a worthy ideal to pass along to our children.	1999-08-20

The idea of a childhood toy taking on a life of it's own struck them as an odd topic for a children's book.<br />I  disagree.  Completely.<br />One of the problems is that adults forget what  it's like to be kids where ANYTHING is possible, including an unusually  blue toy dog having a mind and curiosities of it's own.  While the story is  told from the perspective of Blue Dog and not Big Billy (the human child  who plays with B.D.), it's soon dawns on the reader that the story IS being  told by Big Billy after a fashion.<br />Children play with toys to stimulate  their imagination and, in the case of Billy, to live vicariously through  experiences.  Billy wants a real dog, so, in his mind, Blue Dog functions  as one (including snoozin' with Billy at night).  When I read the story, I  was immediately transported back in time to my OWN childhood where all my  toys took on a secret life of their own (when Toy Story came out, I was  first in line to see it!!  Childhood fantasy put on the big screen!!)  I  took care of my toys (like Billy does) because I didn't want them to get  hurt or lonely.  In my own mind, I sometimes imagined what they would think  if they could, and hence they would take on a life of their own.  I think  that is what the author is trying to do here.<br />The illustrations add so  much to the story that they alone could be the topic of a full-blown essay.  Suffice to say that the realistic-yet-stylized illustrations add so much  depth to the story line and will deeply draw children in.  A HIGHLY  recommended book.	1999-08-18

Reminescent of other famous  pals-- Bert &amp; Ernie, Oscar &amp; Felix-- it's clear that the two have a  very strong friendship tempered by the occasional bout of frustration.<br />It's going to be Toot's birthday, and what CAN you get for the Pig Who  Has Everything??  Puddle, in his travels about town and windowshopping,  finds WONDERFUL things that HE would like, but isn't sure that it would  please TOOT.  Time and time again he finds things that HE would like to  have, but realizes that he's searching for a present for his friend, not  himself (a wonderful watercolor illustration is of Toot eating breakfast  while Puddle slings on his backpack to head out the door for another round  of shopping).<br />The message is simple:  it's the giving, not the gift, it's  the thought that counts, and when present shopping, you should get goodies  for the person you're BUYING FOR, not for yourself, no matter how many  things fly up at you yelling, &quot;BUY ME!  BUY ME!&quot;<br />The  watercolors are some of the most vivid, detailed and comfortable ones I've  seen in a career of reading children's books.  This comes highly  recommended.	1999-08-18

Not so terribly long after the death of Garcia, we have yet another bit of history to share, and share with our children!!  The bright illustrations and twangy, countrified voice of Garcia singing &quot;There ain't no bugs  on me&quot; (to the tune of &quot;It Ain't Gonna Rain No More&quot;) is  worth the price of admission, as it were.  Children will likely have great  fun finding the different bugs who are on everyone (and everywhere) except  the bespectacled, guitar carrying &quot;Garcia&quot; bear.<br />There IS one  problem, and for some folk it'll be a doozie:  The audio footage is from an  album, &quot;Not for Kids Only&quot; which is copyrighted 1993.  The book  is copyright 1999.  In the audio footage, Garcia sings, &quot;Oh, it ain't  gonna' rain no more, no more/it ain't gonna rain no more/how in the hell  can the old folks tell/it ain't gonna' rain no more.&quot;  The text in the  book changes it to &quot;how in the heck can the old folks tell&quot; which  your average child may note because it doesn't rhyme.<br />I personally am a  coordinator for a literacy outreach program here in Pittsburgh, but sadly  we cannot use it in our program due to the possibility of caregivers or  parents taking offense at the word &quot;hell&quot;.  Future purchasers of  the book/cassette set may want to give consideration to this conundrum  before buying.	1999-08-18

Like many young children, Froggy is fearful of the water (and, presumably, other new experiences).  However, by  taking it at his own pace, and with the encouragement of his mother, he  soon masters his skills at swimming (anyone who has or works with young  children will empathize with a tired mom &amp; dad frog who are still  waiting patiently on into the night as Froggy practices his new learning).  While very cute, age appropriate and fun, I have only one criticism:  at  one point, no doubt for humorous effect, Froggy looses his bathing suit and  &quot;turns more red than green.&quot;  Demanding his parents NOT to look,  he skedaddles into the bushes and re-suits.  Perhaps I'm reading into this  too much, but I would hope that children don't come to devolop negative  body issues re: being nude, especially around their own parents (no one  else is at the beach with Froggy, Mom &amp; Dad).  My only concern is that  this might reinforce the unnecessary shameful aspect of nudity that people  in this country embrace and that, IMHO, is often one of the issues that  lead to negative body image in children in America (why do you think we  have so many anorexic/bulimic children here??)	1999-07-16

Rarely have I  found a book that so totally draws me in, makes me believe, and hangs in my  heart after it is finished and shelved with my other treasures.<br /> Many  have commented on Mr. Fuhrman's death, and I would like to, too.  I had no  idea, until the final page, that this was published posthumously.  If the  ending of the book itself wasn't enough to pull my heartstrings and make my  eyes water, the loss to this world of such a brilliant thinker and writer  certainly did.

I remember reading SOMEWHERE-- a textbook on psychology, perhaps??-- that humans absorb about 70% of their world through their eyes.  After reading this work, I am convinced it is paradoxically that the real percentage is  BOTH less *AND* more than this figure.<br /> LESS because we are so often  \\"blind\\" or unaware of what we see and the very NATURE of what we see and  how we see at all.  MORE, because so much rests on our ability to see AT  ALL, especially in the late 20th century, and especially in our culture,  which places such high value on sight (though, perhaps, less value on HOW  we see or WHAT is seen).  But, again, LESS, because we really don't THINK  about what we see or *how* we see...<br /> Mr. Elkins, an art historian--  someone TRAINED to see, if you will-- has done much thinking on the topic  and theory of sight and what it REALLY means to see.  I admit, when I first  got this book, I was afraid it would be the sort of dry, academic drivel  that one would need to plow through with a dictionary at one's side, coming  to the end almost gasping for breath, \\"there!!  &lt;pant, pant&gt; I  finished it!!\\"<br /> Not so at all.  Mr. Elkins has written an extremely  entertaining, thought provoking book on something we all do every day,  often for  every SECOND of the day (and isn't dreaming a form of seeing,  after all, in it's own fashion??), and done it without heavy emphasis on  academia, abstract or unknown concepts, or the general feeling-- that I  have had in other arenas-- that he clearly wishes us to believe that he is  SMARTER than the average reader, and needs to prove it through the use of  highly technical jargon or impenetrable metaphor.<br /> Again, I say,  \\"not at all.\\"  This is a very engaging, thought provoking work that I would  heartily recommend to anyone even REMOTELY interested in the ideas behind  sight and what is (and is NOT) seen.  We do it all the time, every day,  from birth to death, in most cases.

While &quot;book vampire&quot; might be a BIT over-the-top, &quot;ink  drinker&quot; conjures up some wonderful images of a print-devouring book  lover!!  Hats off to a wonderful, new piece of young adult fiction, and  glasses raised in hopes of more from these autor/illustrators!!	1998-12-26
US	52961594	RKWW2VVEAI7EN	0811806553	158776532	Secrets of the Camera Obscura	Books	5	2	2	N	N	brilliant work	Knowles has written a beautiful, moving work rich in languageand imagery.  Through the eyes and experiences of the main character,who owns, operates and researches the camera obscura, we get a glimpse of one man's thoughts and obsessions, his loves and encompassing fears.  Going between his bed, the library and the camera itself, only meeting those who enter the camera obscura, we fully enter his head and his small, focused life in a way that other writers fail to do in hundreds of pages.  I would recommend tracking down this title even it takes a good deal to find it . Highly recommended!!	1998-02-24

The idea behind this book is simple:  100 women models, one box camera, one white room with no props, one video monitor to see what the camera is seeing and one shutter chord to take a photo of yourself...  nude.  This is perhaps the first book of photography where the photographer himself is not actually doing the camera work.  100 women, from vastly different walks of life and ages, pose before the camera to capture how they see themselves.  Rival had only two requests:  don't move the camera, and photograph yourself in the nude.  Like &quot;Naked New York&quot; by Greg Friedler, people looking for hot, &quot;model perfect&quot; women will be disappointed (I'd recommend Playboy or some other rag).  Those who are looking for a wonderful, successful experiment in the model exerting control over her environment, vs. just passively posing, and the exploration of one's self-image, will find this book refreshing, tasteful and moving.	1998-02-14

I agree that this is a fascinating and well done book, but I do not agree with the standard comparison of this book to a &quot;road accident&quot; or other &quot;I shouldn't be looking at this...&quot; sort of experiences.  I, too, like the photographer, am fascinated by people and what makes them tick and how they live and, yes, what they look like...  Including what they look like naked.  Folks looking for some sort of erotic thrill will not likely find it herein.  Folks looking for hot &quot;model-perfect&quot; bodies in the buff will also be disapointed.  But those who are wondering, or have wondered who people are-- people they see or meet walking down the proverbrial street-- will find that this book provokes more questions than anything else.  I want to know more about these folks, more than just the one or two word sentences on the jacket.  What were they thinking before posing?  Why did they pose in the first place?  What statement to they make about themselves and their place in the world by posing clothed and nude?  I quote the author from the intro:  &quot;I photographed each person clothed and naked in order to show the two sides of the same person, the public as well as the private.  The clothed version, as they are seen every day in society, is only part of the truth.&quot;  Similar to this idea is the book, &quot;Self Images: 100 Women.&quot;	1998-02-14

It is definitely worth reading, however, and the pathos of the two main characters and their theatre of poorly done S&amp;M makes the book definitely worth trying to track down	1997-09-04
