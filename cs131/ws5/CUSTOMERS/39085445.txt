Washington's autobiography). Some civil rights leader steps forward on behalf of black people and then uses the concessions gained for self-enrichment.<br /><br />I know that it's hoping for too much for large numbers of black people to pick up this book and find out that: There is no such thing as a selfless leader.<br /><br />As for the book: Highly recommended. It was well written and easy reading. You can tell that Timmerman's research is exhaustive but the writing doesn't read that way. It also avoids going down the road of taking endless pot-shots at the target and is about as objective as humanly possible given that Jesse Jackson is Scum.	2005-10-11

It's well worth the time to invest if you want to see a rarely discussed segment of the Black community.<br /><br />The prose was very easy to read, interesting, and gave away just enough without bludgeoning the reader with detail. Though he didn't give any estimates of how many people he'd bedded down, you could tell that our author had been in bed with a LOT of people.<br /><br />One thing that was very clear by the end of the book was: Anyone you know can be \\"on the DL\\" and that there is no one single reliable strategy to know if you man is one such person.<br /><br />He also suggested a very probable mechanism by which HIV has been spreading so aggresively into black America.<br /><br />Overall, well worth the time.	2005-05-11

Books	5	6	19	N	N	Can be read in 4 hours	Stossel echoes a lot of things that have been said before. Reading this book, I can see snippets of ideas covered by Thomas Sowell, Walter Williams, and Milton Friedman (among others). The fact that this author is popular will mean that much of what these others have said (who have not gotten the audience that they deserve) will be brought before a large number of people for consideration. (I bought this book in an airport, which only stocks books that are likely to move fast.)<br /><br />Bad points:<br /><br />1. No footnotes that could be used if the reader wanted to look deeper into some of the authors sources.<br /><br />Good points:<br /><br />1. Almost no abstractions. So, when reading a book by F.A. Hayek, there is the statement of some general case without giving any specific examples. Not only does John Stossel give specific examples, but he gives many of them for a given instance of an idea. So, a common theme was the difference between intended results and observed results of different government programs. He gave many very specific examples that were interesting and not excessively detailed.<br /><br />2. Good discussion of self-generated victimhood in BOTH the black and Native American population in the USA. A good discussion of how ghettos came to arise. Most people never think about this. They just assume that wherever there are a large numbers of black people there is bound to be crime.<br /><br />3. Exposition of the fact that markets work on a different timescale than bureaucracies, as well as some of the other reasons that bureaucracy just never manages to \\"get it right.\\"<br /><br />This is definitely worth the time it takes to read, even if the prognosis for the US is NOT good based on the trends described in this book.	2005-03-09

These are things you never think about	This is beautiful book. And there are so many good things to be said about them, I've had to abbreviate much of my review in the interest of readability.<br /><br />First, the good points:<br /><br />1. First hand experience with the subject of which he is speaking. This author went through a lot of pain to actually go through some of the processes that he described the local people in different countries that he was describing so as to associate some numbers with the facts. So, he would count out 728 steps in the a particular registration procedure. Or 289 days from start to finish for another.<br /><br />2. His coverage of the American experience with squatters was brilliant. Most people don't understand that it took a long time for America to \\"get it right\\" in terms of assigning property rights and creating the stable country that we have today-- and this is not unreasonable since the type of information that deSoto was gathering had to be found at a lot of different places. (How often do people write about the hisotry of squatters with respect to legal issues?) The stability of American assets and the strong property rights go a long way in explaining why American assets are coveted in such a way as to create the huge trade deficit that the country experiences.<br /><br />3. His understanding of which people involved in the game of assigning property rights were apporpriate for which steps. So, for example, people who made a living as intellectuals only dealing with isolated facts on a page were totally inappropriate to the task-- no matter that they develop the most discussion about said people. Those who deal with \\"nuts and bolts\\" on a regular basis are best for such things.<br /><br />4. Discussion of how legal institutions must accommodate extralegal persons-- especially if they form a majority of the country in question.<br /><br />5. Detailing of the commonality of informal arrangements in places where the government can't be relied on to enforce contracts. It doesn't seem to depend on country or culture or anything of the like. And this author strongly eschews cultural explanations of why people fail to produce wealth-- which is currently en vogue.<br /><br />6. His discussion of how the symbolic representation of things has changed the value of them to large numbers of people (numbers, paper money, etc) is brilliant and just enough.<br /><br />7. He's drawn from many sources and his bibliography is extensive and wonderful.<br /><br />The negative points:<br /><br />1. DeSoto really bludgeons the reader with the fact that private property has the potential to become venture capital. We understood it the first 5,000 times you made the point.<br /><br />2. His idea of \\"surplus value\\" is not clearly distinguished from that of Marx (to whom he refers several times throughout the text). Marx was so thoroughly wrong about so many things, it would do well for him to make separations between his ideas and those of Marx in the text.<br /><br />3. Some of his metaphors were stretched too far. If potential energy goes to kinetic energy, that is one thing. I don't know that it's the same thing as some physical object being seen as capital and becoming earning potential as a result.<br /><br />4. The book was about 220 pages, but could have said the same thing in 150. Big minus, but the book was so strong otherwise it outweighed all of these things.ce contracts.

Though the reading is lighter than it was of the aforementioned Hayek book, it is still not all that light. The book, though only 200 pages, should probably be read at least twice--either by the chapters read and then reread before moving onto the next or by reading the whole thing all the way through twice.<br /><br />Good points (not a complete listing):<br /><br />1. Discussion of what keeps the number of physicians in the country artificially low as well as a discussion of how licensure requirments in any given profession can end up creating a defacto labor union.<br /><br />2. Separation between what are the intended results of any given social program versus what actually happens when these ideas are put into practice. So, this could be the Housing and Urban Development board being responsible for the creation of ghettos--none of which existed before they were created. Or it could the creation of the Federal Reserve, which has a lot of power in the domestic economy, and therefore a lot more power to ruin something on a large scale.<br /><br />3. Follow up of almost every single concept with specific examples to show what he is arguing<br /><br />4. Extrapolation of certain arguments to their logical extreme. So, how is it different from 4 people walking along the street and one picking up a $20 bill and being forced to share it by the other three than redistibutive mechanisms imposed by the government on income? How does it make sense for the government to extract subsidies from taxpayers to support higher prices on agricultural products that its taxpayers are going to buy later?<br /><br />5. Discussion of some of the logical consequences of pursuing \\"equal distribution of income\\" as well as some of the reasons that income/ wealth would be unequal no matter what any one does.<br /><br />This book obviously influences a number of other writers that entered the discussion on Libertarianism (i.e., Thomas Sowell). It's also interesting to note that this book was written at the time when the Soviet Union was thought to still be a threat. The collapse of that Empire, almost 30 years after this book was written is its ultimate vindication.<br /><br />Well worth the time it takes to read it!influences a number of other writers that entered the discussion on Libertarianism (i.e., Thomas Sowell).

There is a very approachable treatment of certain things that could be very technically difficult for some readers, such as regression to the mean.<br /><br />There was a (perhaps too) brief discussion about why Russia failed to thrive under the Communist system. I like brevity, but I could have done with a few more pages (or even a chapter) on why Communism doesn't work. Most people refute it on idelogical grounds, but Kurtzman had a great start in bringing up the technical problems of co-ordinating large amounts of (market-based time scale)information by bureaucracy (which uses a bureaucratic time scale) that he didn't develop at greater length. Finally, someone who understands that this is not a matter of opinion!<br /><br />Good discussion of initial public offerings of companies, which is something that we all \\"know\\" happens, but we often don't know the actors. Good discussion of exactly *what* Michael Milken did that got him into so much trouble. We all knew that he spent about a billion dollars in legal fees and is still worth hundreds of millions of dollars after the fact, but didn't know exactly why.<br /><br />Kudos to him for his beautiful treatment of the complexity of the market and telling us how many players are involved in even the simplest decision.<br /><br />It also gave an interesting explanation of something that I've wondered for a long time, which was how David Bowie managed to sell bonds in himself/ his catalog of songs and make so much money.	2005-03-01

Most people don't think about the social perception of suicide over 10 years ago, let alone 1,000 years ago. But Jamison has done this and done it well. She also captures the feelings of despair and pointlessness that go along with suicide.<br /><br />Toward the end of the book there is too much speculation/ philosophizing and not enough concrete evidence. It is as if she is trying to generalize on experiences that she may have had but without giving us the specific details.<br /><br />All in all, she could have done the same thing with about 50 pages less worth of writing.	2005-02-08

At whom is this aimed?<br /><br />2. Some of the topics were whittled down to bare bones arguments. For the things that he discussed that I did understand, I could see that he left out a lot in the interest of keeping the reader entertained. But the question is: For things that I don't know, how much was left out for the same reasons and how much better could it have been understood if he had bothered to throw in one or two examples with the mathematics worked out.<br /><br />One particularly good example of this was the \\"Arrow's Impossibility Theorem.\\" I would very much like to have seen enough logic discussed to be able to follow the proof.	2005-01-23

Concise, light writing style makes for an easy read. One gets the feeling that this author did use some very detailed statistical analysis in reaching his conclusions but spared the reader all of that-- most of economist statistical methodology being inaccesible to most people.<br /><br />2. Dealing directly with empirical evidence. Most people, when talking about this or that program try to define it by the hoped-for results instead of paying attention to what actually happens when an \\"experiment\\" is conducted. Many (Bono/ The Pontiff) have talked about debt relief for other countries, but Easterly actually looks up some numbers to show what were the results of debt relief, if any.<br /><br />3. Most of the failure of the African continent has been blamed on the inherent stupidity of black people. But Easterley (perhaps) unintentionally shows that most of sub-Saharan Africa suffers from corrupt/ inept/ excessively bureaucratic/ kleptocratic government more than anything. Africans respond to the same incentives as everyone else. It just so happens that no one among the \\"leaders\\" has gotten around to creating appropriate incentive structures for African people to prosper.<br /><br />4. A good highlight of the role of ethnic conflict/ polarization in the role of running a country directly into the ground. It is often repeated again and again at universities what a good idea \\"Multiculturalism\\" is in principle. But Easterly shows what often happens in practice, and that is especially useful in understanding just how serious tribal conflict is in keeping Africa going nowhere.<br /><br />5. There is good discussion of what happens when governments go overboard trying to regulate some industry or another. And evidence that the type of incentive structures are faced by bureaucrats in regulating some market are very different to those who would try to make money in the same market. Two set of people seeing very different aspects of the same situation.<br /><br />6. In one way or another, this is also very good for people who are blathering on (still) about Communism at Western Universities.

Nor do we need to know about all the details of the conquests that explain why some men were so much more succesful at getting their genes propagated than other men.<br /><br />Another thing that I don't like is this anthropomorphic treatment of DNA and genes.  It is never appropriate to speak of an atom as \\"wanting\\" to be in this or that energy state. Is it any more appropriate to speak of genes as \\"wanting\\" to get themselves expressed by any means necessary. Perhaps he wanted to express the situation of succesful DNA being that which survived in large number of copies in a convenient way, but some care should have been taken.<br /><br />There is some thought provoking discussion about the nature of homosexuality and a genetic basis for it. But, it's made a little less convincing by the use of anthropomorphisms around the action of mitochondrial DNA.<br /><br />A strong point: He talked about how sexual imbalances in different societies have led large numbers of men to go elsewhere. This has been replicated by Valerie Hudson in a different type of study. But both authors cited the sex imbalance in China and India as prime examples. If the author had wanted to fill up space in the book, a few more details concerning China and/ or India would have been very appropriate instead of the excessive details of Norse conquests.	2004-12-22

In books like this that are wrought with detail and names, it is difficult to know which things are selectively presented to advance the author's case. Some examples of things that the author doesn't quite tell right:<br /><br />1. Chinese people live in a lot of countries and are very unpopular there. The things that make them disliked (i.e., inherent dishonesty, cloying hubris) may not all be on the part of the host country. The author admits as much when she talks in the earlier pages of the book about Chinese people having much experience avoiding laws and government regulations. So, for example, after the 9/11 attacks on the USA most of the immigration tightening had an effect on Chinese people, who are also the vast majority of those who commit immigration evasion. Chang would call this \\"institutionalized discrimination\\" or discrimination of some sort, when in fact it just so happens that there are more Chinese people breaking those particular laws at any given time.<br /><br />2. Most of the problems between Chinese and Westerners were actually a matter of *Labor Conflict.* It is a brutal thing in many places. This was not unique to the USA. This could have been explained a bit more clearly.<br /><br />3. Chinese people very often go to other countries and try to extend China into them. (Malaysia, Canada, etc.) This was not addressed by Chang at all. (Note that she mentioned that most Chinese who enrolled in the Army did so because they thought they were defending China against Japan and not the USA after the Pearl Harbor attack.) Host countries are not receptive to what they percieve as \\"ungrateful outsiders.\\" Not least are the Han Chinese in China itself, who are more brutal to ethnic minorities in their quest to turn them into Chinese people than the US government ever was trying to turn Chinese people into Americans. So now what? It's acceptable (not mentioned) when Han Chinese do it, but terrible when Whites (whoever they are) do?<br /><br />4. The Wen Ho Lee case, as Chang described it, could have been seen as \\"persecution,\\" but much evidence came up later of Chinese double agents. Not to mention the fact that a large number of people working in sensitive defense industries may be recent Chinese immigrants and therefore subject to closer scrutiny. (There was recently an affair between two people, one American and the other Chinese. The Chinese partner--a woman--passed sensitive information to the Chinese government.) Frequently, Chang would have us believe that it was undeserved, or that the government acted without provocation. But it just so happens that there are a large number of laws which Chinese are likely to violate disproportionately and will therefore be on the unpleasant side of law enforcement.<br /><br />On the good side:<br /><br />1. The statistical research was fairly tight. When she talked about higher household incomes, she addressed the hidden variable of higher workforce participation. This is something that people don't talk about much when pointing out higher Asian income.<br /><br />2. Chang makes a good, clear distinction between the different types of Chinese people that have come to the US at various periods. We can at least understand that they are not all the same. One good example is the differing perceptions of the different groups toward black people. So, the earlier arrivals wanted nothing to do with them. Later, more progressive groups saw them as allies against the establishment.<br /><br />3. The book's explanation of the self-selection of the immigrants is a strong point. Most of the people who fled China were fleeing something even worse than what they went to. And the author is not shy about dealing with the morass that was created in Greater China as a push factor into the US. (Given the Chinese tendency toward chauvinism, it's amazing that Chang was willing to admit even this much.)4.

I finished the whole thing in 1 day.<br /><br />2. There is some much needed discussion of heritability, something that is very commonly misunderstood popularly.<br /><br />3. A very cogent explanation of why genetic determinism is not sufficient to explain behavior.<br /><br />4. Separation of the concepts of \\"correlation\\" and \\"causation.\\" This is something that \\"everybody knows\\" are two separate things, but this author actually went into the details with his illustration of the \\"Chopstick Gene\\" that is found in Asian people. He also talks about what it means when you have two populations with fairly similar averages, which is: There will be plenty of overlap between the populations, especially if the \\"spread\\" is sufficiently high.<br /><br />5. His handling of the genetic origins of intelligence are very sensitive and balanced, as well as his discussion of what IQ tests measure.<br /><br />6. The experimental detail in this book is not overwhelming. It's just enough so that you'll get a sense of what is being discussed (if you're a dabbler in Biological Science).<br /><br />7.

A few of them are below:<br /><br />1. Characterizations: Poor, one-dimensional loser-dork characters. Some of them are True Wastes of Human Life. (Example: a character who takes a prostitute to his room and spits in her face when he doesn't like the price that she offers him and then rough-handles her. Another example: People that can't make it through a whole bus ride without getting stoned and then get robbed by someone that was paying attention to the squalor of these people.)<br /><br />2. Plot: One scene of drunken Valium-popping/ weed-smoking/ drinking after another. Not too interesting. Many different countries were visited, and they could have been detailed more thoroughly. *These* are the things that a reader would want to know about going abroad. How do the people live? What are their conversations like? You can stay in your home country and get stoned and it will be the same thing as if you did it some number of thousands of miles away.<br /><br />3. Insight: Gives an idea of what some of the Strange White People in this game (EFL) are like, but a poor impression of people that actually do this to make money, etc. When living and working in Asia, you meet a LOT of losers. But we aren't *all* that way. There are some people that are on the ball.<br /><br />4. Writing quality: Poor. And I don't know if this is because the editing was skipped that could have made the book better or if the writing is just inherently poor. I could say that latter without any feeling of being disingenuous. The author tries to wax philosophical but does a very poor job.

It shows us that people seem to like to be miserable wherever they are and at whatever time we choose to observe them. It doesn't seem to depend on anything.<br /><br />2. The length was neither too long nor too short. Some books just drag on and on and on. In addition to the strong characterizations, the author gave us an idea of the magnitude of poverty in India and the destructive nature of the caste system that people don't seem to want to emerge from no matter how many centuries pass.<br /><br />3. The characters were very well developed and believable. Again, just enough detail was used-- but not too much. And many of these characters are something that we might imagine having seen in real life.	2004-11-21

It seems that the author uses too many words to say things. Much like any book written by Ayn Rand, between 50-70% of the book could have been omitted with no major loss in content.<br /><br />Also: When talking about social theory, it is absolutely critical to back up general statements with specific examples. And this was not done to my satisfaction.<br /><br />Hayek's later book, \\"The Fatal Conceit\\" covered many of the same themes that were detailed in this book.

The author stated clearly at the beginning that this book was to be treated as merely his speculations on Chinese history.<br /><br />He hit the nail right on the head. Working here and talking to the people (either in Mandarin or English) you will see that people are very determined to live fixated in the 9th century or so. And it's not going to change any time soon. A better question to ask might have been: \\"Is it amazing that China moved toward modernity as soon as it did?\\"<br /><br />Jenner details all the same arguments that I have heard time and time again. \\"You are not Chinese, so you don't understand.\\" Or, when asking an analytical point \\"Chinese culture is not subject to the same rules of analysis as Western culture.\\" Or, when talking about some observation \\"That is the difference between Chinese culture and Western Culture.\\" If you were having these conversations yourself, you'd find that, indeed, the state is the religion of the people here. And you find the same cultural conflict between people here and modernity as you do in the Middle East. It only *looks* like something different here because the \\"religion\\" is not as clearly one as in the Islamic World.<br /><br />I have asked my students many times \\"If a man walks between here and McDonald's 1,000 times, his total displacement is zero. So, could the last 2,300 years of functioning governments have been going back and forth over the same ground again and again?\\"<br /><br />Jasper Becker wrote a very good book (The Chinese), which talks about the circular nature of Chinese history, but not in as much depth as this.<br /><br />As well written as it is, most people will not ever hear of this book and will make the same faulty assumptions that others do when they come to this vast dinosaur of a country to sell one sock to 1.3 billion people.	2004-10-26

It was my idea that there would be transcriptions that corresponded note for note to the tunes that were played on the CD.  That turned out to be incorrect.<br /><br />Also: Something that a person always wants to know is patterns for jazz. It would have been one thing if the melody line of the tune was written in one place (and didn't correspond to what was played on the CD) but the patterns that were used to spice up the tracks were written elsewhere. As it happened, even the patterns were written nowhere. Can it really be that the study of jazz patterns is so separate from solo piano that it needn't be covered in one place?<br /><br />I can't recommend which book has patterns and solo ideas at the same time, but I do know that this book is NOT the place to start looking.	2004-10-11

The descriptions of certain things rambled on, such as the dirt in the kitchen being in \\"delirious communion\\" with dirt someplace else. The author's attempt at being cerebral seemed a bit...... labored.<br /><br />2. Themes-- He doesn't spare any of his hostility toward the church, which has not been *all* bad in the black community.<br /><br />3. This book is a great example of characterization. The reader is almost left with more questions going out that coming in.  For example: What is evil? John was not certain of his holiness at the beginning of the book, but after his experience on the threshing-floor decided to join it. This is after we have found out about all the misdeeds of several of the members present at the service. So are we to conclude that John is just as disturbed as the others? Or are we to conclude that some characters were really better than we thought they were after all the details about the relationships come to light?<br /><br />The author went a bit too far trying to find profound descriptions and metaphors. The book would have been much lighter and easier reading without them.<br /><br />I hadn't picked up a fiction book in a number of years. This book reminds me why: It is so difficult to speculate as to the author's lines of reasoning when people describe abstractions. At least in a book about some real historical subject, less is left to the imagination.	2004-09-12

Reading Ease-- This book was light and the fact that it was 500 pages is made to seem more like it was 200 pages.<br /><br />2. Character development-- Again, excellent. Some of the remarks that the characters made in the book very witty and worth underlining/ keeping in memory. It is interesting how strong the characterizations were even with the limited narrator's point of view. There were no larger than life characters (see any Ayn Rand book for an example).<br /><br />3. Historical detail-- This, too was very good but not such that it made the book overwrought with detail. There are a few extras that he might have mentioned, such as the Japanese habit of using a person's name instead of \\"you\\" as a way of being less direct. And also the way of talking around things instead of coming straight to the point. I could also have done with a bit more detail as to *why* the okiya and the geisha were interdependent.<br /><br />All in all, a very good read.	2004-09-01

This young man came to China with an open mind and is fundamentally different from much of the young expatriate population here, both in terms of his intellingence and his goals in coming. (Typical personalities: &quot;I'm a Loser Back at Home, but when I come to China I'm a Big Man on Mulberry Street.&quot; Another: &quot;I'm Young and Bored and Trying to Convince Myself That There is a Communist Revolution Somewhere.&quot;)<br />Some books that have been written have also tried specifically to address the political issues of this vast country.  It is more interesting to someone who is not a professional protestor/ academic to see what happens in practice when some of the Romanticized Sacred Cows of Academics are implemented in Real Life (see: Communism, Authoritarianism, Big Government).  This is also not taken from the perspective of people that are constantly whining about Human Rights.<br />In my opinion, the author does a good job of not reinterpreting China in terms of some of these Sacred Cows, be they of whoever.<br />The prose is clear, elegant and not overwrought with detail. But the reading is not overly light, either. It's just the things that any person would think about if they came here to teach. Or that any person might want to know if they wanted a perspective of China independent of political slants of any type.	2004-07-19

Specifically of interest:<br />1. The reason that the Kuomintang was not successful in China was constant corruption. Some people have suggested that Chinese people love tyrants (Jasper Becker, \\"The Chinese\\") and this is the explanation of why they rejected what would have been a democratic government for an authoritarian government. This is partially true, but the Kuomintang blew any chance that it had at legitimacy with its rampant corruption.<br />2. That the Communist Party became popular because they promised to not be like the corrupt and crooked Kuomintang. Her father is an example of one of the wide-eyed idealists that really believed in his cause at the beginning and was left a broken man when he saw what actually became of this grand vision. People at Western universities are always attacking the West and praising the Communist ideology/ governent allocation of resources, and they haven't a faintest idea of the actual RESULTS of the intended programs. Nor do they understand the incentive structures that led to those results.<br />3. Historical accounts of the great famine.  I can't believe that this very afternoon, there are still people trying to talk away this historical event in China and say that it was just a statistical illusion.  This is the second author that I've read that gives historical accounts of people eating their children.<br />4. Demonstrating how the cult of Mao was created and maintained, as well as what were his motives in the various campaigns (Cultural Revolution/ The Great Leap Forward) that swept the country during his reign. Another author (Anhua Gao) has also noted that Mao generated a lot of morass in the country because the weaker the country, the easier it was to control. But her detail is not comparable to the author of this book. She showed the self-denunciation meetings and the stages of his campaigns to keep the country divided and fighting against itself. It may be another 200 years before China shakes off the residual results of his rule (such as overpopulation and then the resulting sex imbalance that has come about because of population control), but here in this is an example of WHAT happened, and HOW it happened.<br />5. Showing the highly ritualized behavior of Chinese people in things such as foot binding, etc. A lot of people may come to China and wonder where people here get their ideas from and why they are prisoner of them. This author demonstrates that it's been that way for a *long* time. And it may never change.<br />It's hard to recommend this book enough times for someone who wants *actual results* of what happens in the context of a Communist Revolution, as opposed to the vague ramblings of something like the Communist Manifesto or state-sheltered academics in Western universities.campaigns to keep the country divided and fighting against itself.

That's about the only conclusion that I could come to after reading this work.<br />There were a few problems, mainly with plausibility. For instance: How much of this is really true, knowing her penchant to  bend reality? On more than one occasion, she described herself trying to decide which version of the truth to tell her boyfriend.  I'm sure that she took a lot more artistic license with readers than she would have us believe. Are there really *so* many people who would pay *so* much for sex that she could make a living by being a call girl who only accepts referrals?<br />Another: Did anyone get the feeling that she was a bit....... whiny? Bursting into tears in the psychiatrist's chair? Bursting into tears with her boyfriend over this or that?<br />Lastly: I've been in the mental health game for a while and know that Quan was rather selective in revealing details of her relationship with her therapist. What was she diagnosed with? I happen to know that psychiatrists DON'T spend that much time listening to a patient muse about this and that problem/ dark desire.  They want to find out what are the symptoms, medicate them, and then get you OUT of there.  Most visits last about 15 minutes-- if that. Her mention of either any medication regimen or a diagnosis are conspicuously absent, given the level of detail that she included in other aspects.<br />The writing itself was pretty decent.  But the book didn't stand the test of plausibility. At least not from the perspective of a mental health patient.  This view has been echoed on here by reviewers who have worked in the sex industry and found this piece a bit..... inconsistent.	2004-01-25

The use of specific historical examples to develop the general idea (deductive reasoning) and NOT vice versa (inductive reasoning). Many sociologists get so caught up in trying to make fine sounding phrases that they don't understand that there is a qualitative difference in going from examples to suppositions and not the other way around.<br />2. Succinctness.  A great many books go on for a very long time and manage to assert very little. (Read anything by Ayn Rand lately?) This book is very to the point and short on words.<br />The way that we know that his predictions are with merit is that they have come true 50 years *after* the book was written.<br />Ten examples of things for which he gives good, mechanistic explanations/ predictions are:<br />1. Noting that movements for the rights of this group or that group often end with finished products/ governments that are WORSE than the formerly existing order. (Africa).<br />2. Explanations of why it is in the best interest of governments to have citizens that are less well educated.  The less well informed are citizens, the less likely they are to hold government accountable for serious mistakes because they aren't aware of what's happening. (United States)<br />3. If there is no cause, people will invent one. (The Islamic world. Student protestors on university campuses).<br />4. When people stay caught in religious movements (or any movement too long), then it will divert other energy that could have been used for other more immediately useful tasks. The net result will be backwardness. (Islamic world again. Sub-Saharan Africa and tribal conflicts.)<br />5. This book makes a clean separation between the Dixiecrats in the American South and the Poor White Trash as the creators of problems for blacks. While he only devoted two sentences two it, it could have well been expanded to explain to explain the origin of the Segregation laws (which happened AFTER the Reconstruction governments).<br />6. He talks about the role of class in assimilation.  (The Cubans in Miami have tried to recreate Cuba in Miami because the people the managed to get out were the richest people.  But no other ethnic group has gone as far in creating an ethnic enclave because these people were from the lower echelons of their own respective home countries.)<br />7. Religious conversion is *incidental* to whatever conqueror there is gaining control of the government.  (So Christianity was not taken up in Japan because the conquerors did not control the government.  But in places where the rapport was made between the government and the colonizers, the subjects were converted almost as an afterthought.)<br />8. Shows that there is separation between men of action, men of words, and fanatics.  Some people are actually capable of going out and getting things organized and done, but may not be the greatest speaker (George Bush). Others may speak very well, but be capable of nothing else (WEB DuBois).  And others just like to stay inflamed and create chaos because that's what they do best (bin Laden).<br />9. Revolutions must take place in certain steps.  And there must be people who are *looking* for something to change. (All the talk of radicalism in New England at Harvard and the other Ivy League Institutions may not amount to anything.)<br />10. Succesful governments befriend the \\"learned men\\" (intellectuals), so that they don't become mouthpieces against the governments/ catalysts for revolution. This system existed for centuries in Mainland China. It exists in some sense in the Western World (Universities. The tenure system. Intellectuals won't go *that* far in promoting the destruction of the system that ultimately keeps them employed.)<br />This book has many good things that can be learned. It's only 160 pages. But it should take at least two weeks to read if read properly. And I believe that it has more *authenticated* knowledge than most sociology degree courses.operly.

Only in academia could someone call themselves crazy and get a tenured position because of it.<br />This book is 200 pages, start to finish. And while the reading is very easy and light, she is a bit excessively--um-- florid in her writing style. Everything is &quot;absolutely&quot; this or &quot;totally&quot; or &quot;incredibly&quot; that.  And bloated writing starts to wear on the nerves after 200 pages.<br />Her descriptions of the actual experience of having bipolar (I'm a male sufferer of this disorder) are very relevant and accurate. Especially her descriptions of the manias. It's very easy to look back after the fact and realize that what you did was inappropriate. But in the heat of a manic episode, it's impossible to stop. Her writing is that of someone who has looked back and analyzed her behavior long after the fact (It's usually done this way, since, as she demonstrates, a person's perceptions are skewed during these times.)  And she only uses a few pages to describe what comes afterward-- the depression and the feeling of utter hopelesness. There are other things: The hypersexuality. Unchecked spending.  Manic rage. Emotional instability.<br />She demonstrates that it's not all bad. The feeling of being manic is very good. You get things done. Your mind works much more quickly. You can perform better on less sleep.<br />This book is actually a bit more well written than Susanna Kaysen's &quot;Girl, Interrupted.&quot;  But significantly less powerful than Elie Wiesel's &quot;Night,&quot; which managed to easily paint a much more vivid picture of human emotional turmoil in 1/2 the amount of space.<br />If on the subject of bipolar, this book is very relevant. It's questionable how useful it would be in getting someone who is not afflicted with this disease to understand it. But it's a start at the least.<br />And it gives the reader an idea of what goes on in the minds of mentally ill people afflicted with various disorders. People often wonder why sick people refuse to take their medication. And there is some discussion of that contained in this book.  Though it's not directly related to the issue of bipolar, it is relevant for anyone who has watched a loved one not go through some treatment of *any* illness because they just weren't willing to believe that they were ill.<br />The relationships with other people could have been developed a bit better. It would have been useful (for a sufferer of bipolar) to notice his relationships with people as a gauge of his behavior.

Makes a clear distinction between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" carbohydrates.

Points out the regulating what you eat consistently (i.e., at each meal) is a better way to go than going on six week diets. There is no way to lose weight but by eating right.<br />4. Shows the *detailed references* upon which his reasoning is based.  And demonstrates how his diet was tested and survived the authentication process in other studies.<br />5. Explains some things that are often overlooked: A. The obstructive bureaucracy involved in the FDAs assignment of categories to foods and the resulting slowness of change of conventional diets (The FDA is the reason that drugs cost so much in the US, in spite of what some of these babbling neo-hippie protestors would have us believe about \\"corporate greed.\\") ; B. The fact that humans are eating higher levels of foods that were actually not available to use 100,000 years ago when people were essentially the same as now, but with different diets. We were actually not evolved to eat such things as we are now; C. Debunks some of the common myths about exercising and then eating *whatever* after that will undo all that you've just done.<br />6. Gives the Reader's Digest version of the behavior of the body under abnormal circumstances (excess insulin production, etc.)<br />His writing style is also fabulously easy to read, and the book is set up in such a way that you can find the papers to get more detailed discussions of some facts of which he gives the Reader's Digest version in the passages.<br />Some aspects may be too technical for people who don't have any background in science.

Or, should I say, realistic proportions.  Most people would never eat this stuff anyway (at least not as he suggested it).<br />But what he takes a fair number of pages to say is that if you just eat the 40-30-30 way, then you should be all right.  And, in his Spartan, approachable writing style he gives you the pitfalls of a lot of common bad habits (some true things on the nature of exercise routines, etc).<br />What he makes the most clear is the things that you should NOT eat (which happens to be almost everything that tastes good), and WHY you shouldn't eat it.<br />Dr. Sears is probably laughing all the way to the bank with this book.	2003-06-08

Or at least something like well thought out. (Essay on the Sex Industry in Latin America observed that some of the most militant black men are the \\"first ones to jump into bed with a white woman.\\")<br />Others (Amiri Baraka) were just rambling.  When I read these books written by black \\"intellectuals\\" I wonder: Can people really believe *anything* subject to feedback from reality? Apparently they can in the case that they are academics-- which effectively means NO feedback from reality.<br />The value of this book, IMHO is to demonstrate to black people exactly why academics/ intellectuals are the perfect place to go if you want the WRONG information. WEB DuBois, for example. As much as everyone talks about him, it seems overlooked that he became disgusted when his ideas didn't get lauded with the praise and acceptance that he deserved. And he actually ended up dying a bitter old man and being buried in Ghana.<br />One thing that I see as a thread of commonality in all of these essays is that they obsessively reinterpret EVERY SINGLE ISSUE as something for political acion. Or collective action of some sort.<br />The other consistency is that they misunderstand the economics of \\"black issues.\\" Everyone seems to think that if you take a sociological approach to these things (i.e.,nonsense uttered with seeming profundity--see Amiri Baraka) or repeat them enough times, they'll become true.<br />It might have been nice if they'd [=the various authors] shown a few more examples of where NOT to go, as learned from past mistakes (i.e., the political panacea), or critiqued what had actually happened when some of these earlier \\"intellectuals'\\" ideas had actually been put into practice. Or, derived the origin of some of the problems in reasonably concrete terms.  (Housing projects and welfare roles leading to the destruction of the black family, for example.)<br />I hope that this stands as an example for blacks who take the time to read it just what *not* to do for economic success.o read it just what *not* to do for economic success.	2003-06-08

Because he takes so many directions throughout the book, I'll pick a few germane examples and go with them.<br />1. \\"All the good jobs (manufacturing) have gone South. Or have been driven right out of the country.\\" The economists will tell you that this is the normal scheme of things in improving productivity. He does not make any policy recommendations about it, but comes *that* close to so doing.<br />2. \\"The Japanese/ Europeans are overtaking us in science. We've invested too much damned money in defense, and their economies are booming because of their better directed funds.\\" Later proven to be 150% wrong. You can have as many well educated people as you want, but if you have out-of-control labor unions (Germany) or efficiency draining protectionism (Japan), or a smothering public sector (France) then it won't much matter. And we've seen what happened in the past (China), when a country weakens its military to the point of ineffectiveness at the behest of some intellectual. It *seems* to make so much sense to invest as much possible in education. But when that and other things are done in practice (at the expense of the military/ other things), does that make so much sense?<br />3. \\"The Americans scored lower than the British and Canadians on science tests in categories X, Y, and Z.\\" But strange enough: Having lived in Britain, the government sends all these well trained chemists to universities where they graduate to find..... NO jobs! And the income per capita in GB is about 35% less than it is the USA. The gap is not quite so wide between us and the Western Europeans. According to The Economist, the gap between the US and Western Europe has widened over time, with our having a GDP per capita 54% higher than theirs. The Eastern Europeans likely score higher than the Americans on science exams of many sorts. But what does that mean directly in terms of income?<br />4. \\"Communism was just an 'experiment' tried in China that failed.\\" We can think of a lot of things that are \\"experiments,\\" and yield catastrophic results. And how long they take to fix. The regime of Mao has made mistakes that could take decades (at least 5) to fix even if China reversed course this afternoon and tried to fix it. (A sex imbalance created by a one child policy that was create to counteract a policy of \\"every mouth comes with two hands\\" is going to spell doom for China in the next 20 years or so.) Does it make sense to stick with what we know that works, or to try to experiment with this and that without any idea of the long term cost? It's not like working in a chemical lab. You can't throw away the chemicals and start again without anyone saying too much about it.<br />5. \\"Government regulation/ action is the 'solution' to this or that educational problem.\\" But is it just my imagination, or is the way paved for some special interest group (the NEA, for example) to systematically create labor conditions that are in their interest? There is not one state in which there is not a tenure system at the K-12 level. But the Catholic schools (not part of the nationwide convention of tenure) seem to produce much better students. But the NEAs members have some very cushy jobs, paid for by American taxpayers.<br />It seems like the moral of the book is \\"Do these things X, Y, and Z. And they'll all lead to something that creates a demand for more of my services as an academic/ educator.\\"  It *seems* like it is better to have a population that knows less than more. But when a \\"literati\\" public is more likely to elect leaders who are \\"intellectual,\\" there is nothing but problems. France: Let's go on strike about this or that every month. Britain: Let's have health care that is \\"free\\" (at the point of service) and then wonder why we have to inject money into it every other week to keep it from collapsing. (The dental care there [...]. I've experienced this first hand.)<br />The book is so well written. But the later topics are too broad for him to actually offer case studies on the things that he comes very near to suggesting are good ideas.<br />Draw the appropriate lesson from this book: Just because an academic says it smoothly, it ain't necessarily true...].

Armchair leaders, who would perish without the comfort of the Ivory Tower (Noam Chomsky). I should start by saying that such foolishness could only come from a university setting. In no other case would people spend so much time trying to talk away things that have been demonstrated to be foolish by the experience of others.<br />A few examples:<br />1. Manning Marable's article compares Booker T. Washington to Louis Farrakhan? Huh? Huh? Huh? This person is selling himself as a professor of history, yet he doesn't know that the main idea of what Washington said was to AVOID trying to find a political resolution to every single problem? Louis Farrakhan generates lots of heat but doesn't shed very much light on what would be *realistic* solutions to the problems in black America.<br />2. Empty Phrases used every third page or so, like &quot;People of Color.&quot; Anyone who can read the Statstical Abstract of the United States knows that peole of color have nothing in common other than being non-white. The similarities stop right there in terms of income, incarceration rates and representation in &quot;higher&quot; professions. Everyone seems to have looked right past this in their quest to have some subjects to generate a leadership position for himself.<br />3. There are almost no specific numbers or studies here. So Howard Zinn will say things like: &quot;We are wealthy enough for full employment and free education as well a free health care for everyone.&quot; But other countries (i.e., Canada and Britain) have found out that it is one thing to promise something and then quite another to support the bureaucracy that will carry this out. A systematic study of what has really happened in other countries that have tried these grandiose ideas might change the minds of these academics. But, as always, evidence is neither mentioned nor presented. But these articles are ALL very light in terms of their analytical gravitas.<br />Bottom line #1: Black America has been set back a good long way by relying on arguments like these presented in this book. If anything, reading this book has made me even MORE conservative. Bottom line #2: The government cannot legislate every problem out of existence.

Everything is there. Reagents. Cross references to books that deal only in reagents, and so on and so on.<br />Often, one sees textbooks that give reactions and simply assume that they will work without citing a reference where someone has actually gone through the trouble to see if the reaction really will work. (This, I have found, is the quickest way to waste time in the lab.  The easier it is to locate a protocol, the higher your lab productivity is.)<br />It's also good to see that he's taken the time and trouble to whittle away some of the pretty colors that a lot of books put in in order to try to draw the reader's attention away from the glaring lack of substance.<br />This book may, in the next few years, supercede the March text because a good number of his references are from within the past 5 years (50%, I believe), and it is such that if you are working in the lab and need to find *that* particular reference, then you can easily go and look it up.	2003-03-05

Application: One uses this book in a course on spectroscopy, which is something used in the lab in *real life* (picture someone in academia knowing about that!).

Problems: There are no answers to the problems.  The Atkins book (Physical Chemistry) is used for about 95% of Physical Chemistry classes in the USA.  But they give the answers to the odd numbered problems, so that you can go through and work them out and check your answer.  The even numbered problems are not given answers, but are usually a variation of the odd numbered ones.	2003-02-23

This book gives a detailed explanation of WHY societies are different and explains HOW some conflicts occur as a result of \\"multiculturalism.\\"<br />This is a book that could be read by many people on university campuses to settle their hash about their reasons for wanting \\"diversity.\\" And some of the real life conflicts that can spin out of control, never to be resolved as a result thereof.<br />One such example he gives is Sri Lanka, where the conflict between the different languages there has gotten so out of control that it has destroyed an economy that had great potential.  It echoes what was written in Lee Kwan Yew's book \\"From Third World to First,\\" but when it is read in the context of this book, it is a more potent example.<br /><br />As a scientist, I think that the best part of this (social science) book is that it made a model to explain the data as opposed to writing things just because they \\"sound nice.\\" So one often hears in Pan African Studies the notion of \\"European Culture,\\" and \\"African Culture\\" without any good, detailed set of observations that this idea needs to explain. His observation of the alignments of different groups in conflicts between major powers is what his working hypothesis explains. He shows that there is indeed a lot of overlap between the thinking patterns of people from certain parts of the country. For example: Legalism and social control are major elements of Chinese Society. Though Singapore is not a \\"Chinese\\" society the way that Huntington would have us to believe, they are indeed obsessed with controlling everything. But on the other hand, they have taken elements from his concept of \\"Western\\" society. The quotes from the popular press and the position of the government show that they are fully aware of adopting these elements from two different societies. No one needs to go out on a limb looking for why they don't have open democracy (as has Christopher Lingle): It was not in their minds to begin with.<br />I don't think that this book was meant to be an exhaustive detailing of every single country in every single society, because that would be just too dense and too difficult to read. But it does give a very useful theoretical apparatus from which to look at these things.<br />Often, one hears quoted that the attacks on our country in Sept. were because of \\"United States' Foreign Policy.\\" (Incidentally, it is most often heard at universities.) But the conflict between Muslims and Christians has been going on for a very long time. The presence of the USA in these later years shows that because of the more fundamental conflict of Islam vs. West, if it were not the USA, then it would just be someone else. Finally, here is a reasonable analysis that is not just a matter of fine anti-American phrases that one hears so often out of the ivory towers in the USA.<br />His analyses are something that would be very useful for our government to understand and learn from in their application of foreign policy. Both by way of understanding who is a useful ally, and in terms of WHY certain social prescriptions are not appropriate for other countries (i.e., human rights in China). Huntington quotes one speaker (Matahir Mohammed) as saying that Asians like \\"deception\\" as a way of behavior. That is 150% percent true. Most of the immigration to our country now is from these areas of the world who have NO concept of things that it has taken the West hundreds of years to discover. This could be paving all the right circumstances for a disaster in the future. And if it does come, one cannot say that it was never written down somewhere.<br />This is a result of very different ways of thinking.

The title is disingenuous. He give about 5 pages to defining China as a superpower, but then spends several chapters blowtorching it.<br />One thing that he understands is that the China has had a *very* long time to devlop a democratic model but they have never been able to do it. He also implicitly excuses their model of government as something necessary for people who have no concept of \\"rule of law\\" (and they certainly don't have that in China, nor is it established very well in the national psyche). At least not as well as the other traditions are (Confucianism, Maoism, Daoism, Legalism).<br />Strengths: He understands the complex factors that go into the building of a society and a sound economy, among them being the protection of property rights and impartial law enforcement. When he gives examples, he gives enough to let us know that he is not comitting the \\"fallacy of composition\\" mistake, but not too many to bog us down with 1,001 details of the same thing.<br />Weaknesses: Not enough analysis of the bank loan problems, for one. Nor enough analysis of the GDP numbers. At the time of this publication, people weren't publishing enough questioning reports of China's GDP statistics.<br />I also question his figures about the Chinese people not having the capability of feeding the whole country. That has a distinctly Malthusian sound--something that has recieved one of the most thorough refutations of any notion in social sciences.<br />The book could have been taken in any number of directions at greater length. For example: He talks of the social problems that are there, such as crime and prostitution. But he did not detail where else that has happened and whether China's experience is better or worse that than of other countries under similar circumstances.<br />Prescient Observations:<br />1. The Vietnamese have developed the skills of resistance fighting as a result of many years of trying to hold back the advance of the Han Chinese and their tendency to eclipse and absorb all other indigineous cultures into which they came in contact.<br />2.

Books	2	1	1	N	N	Fairly gravitas free	This book has not really said anything new that has not been said in other books-- particularly &quot;The China Dream&quot; (J. Studwell). It's just that they spent a lot less time analyzing their assertions.<br />It just seems a bit, well, incomplete.<br />1. They spend a lot of time worrying about the balance of trade. On the one hand, they talk against mercantilism and label it as &quot;bad,&quot; but on the other, they attribute Japan's technological advance as the reason for its trade surplus. Nevermind that the trade surplus has gotten higher during the worse parts of their extended economic crisis, or that the US trade deficit has gotten more negative during the longest expansion in our history.<br />2. Countries are NOT corporations. They assert that there are production chains (of a sort), in which there are companies that invent, others that innovate, and still others that manufacture. So, by this line of reasoning, the US (with its great commitment to basic research) is an inventor, Japan (with its great commitment to reinventing the wheel/ improving existing technology) is an &quot;innovator,&quot; and China (with neither the capability to invent things, nor &quot;innovate&quot; them) is a manufacturer. Is this really what one observes in real life? The United Kingdom may actually have MORE publications in basic research (when adjusted for the population size) than the US, but its economy is no more productive than that of, say, Singapore. In fact, the GDP percapita in Singapore is actually HIGHER than in the UK.<br />3. There have been more chances for China to get involved in world trade and &quot;The Global Economy,&quot; than the authors mentioned. But each time, they have failed. The authors threw this out, but did not spend enough time detailing any of the examples that they gave. For example: The authors asked if China was &quot;able&quot; to innovate. Rather than speaking of this in terms of their infrastructure (insufficient access to public universities, etc) and organization, they gave some vague, grasping reasons for their failure.<br />4. What does a &quot;technology trade balance&quot; mean? France has a negative balance of trade with roughly 40% of the number of patent applications as the USA (which has a huge postive balance of trade in that area). Japan, on the other hand, has a balance less than 1/15th of that of the US, but with three times the number of patent applications. Does this mean that foreigners find that their investment in technology goes further in France and choose to invest it there (hence the negative balance of trade)? Does this mean that the average patent is less fruitful in Japan than in the USA? There is almost no discussion of this chart in the text.<br />In summary, I would prefer just a bit more detail/ gravitas and a little less Japanese chauvinism in this book.versities, etc) and organization, they gave some vague, grasping reasons for their failure.<br />4.

On the other, it is nice when you read a book about something that disproves something that you've always thought wrong and you can say \\"Oh!

Thematic organization would have been immensely useful to an otherwise very good idea.<br />Also, some of the topics that he brought up were not supported by numbers.

But it would be nice to have seen some correlation coefficients when he talked of this and that as being correlated. There are also more detailed things that I might like to have known/ seen verified in the discussions of black income, such as differing average ages and an adjustment for the fact that 56% of blacks live in the South, where there is a significant income differential.<br />Kudos to him for his description of differences in BEHAVIOR as accounting for differnces in output. Thomas Sowell has written on this point exhaustively, especially in his \\"Race and Culture\\" trilogy, but he deliberately used other examples to show that in different places, similar mentalities will lead to similar results. Really, very little that has been shown here (in the way of data) is different to what has been shown before. It's just that the writing in this piece makes for lighter reading--at the sacrifice of some details.<br />With this qualification, I will rate the book 5 stars not because of its analysis, but because of its willingness to confront some of the garbage that one hears in black studies departments across the country and some of the lines of reasoning/ refrains that one hears from black students that are so identical as to make one believe that Black Studies departments are second only to the Chinese government in terms of propaganda.<br />One thing that might have helped the book would have been the theme: \\"I see this trend, here is Citation X in support of that.\\" On the one hand, he did better than do most people who write about this by giving specific examples of what he was talking about (especially the study patterns of black students), but on the other, it is sometimes very hard to believe everything that people claim to have witnessed, no matter how smart they are.  It is for this reason that I am partial to authors who use examples that are at least confirmed by a third party.<br />Kudos again to him for showing some of the distorted thinking processes that go into perpetuating things such as Afrocentric interpretations of history. Without restating the whole book, I must say that he is a far cry from the writings of people like Carter G. Woodson. Read this and you'll not be disappointed.s that are at least confirmed by a third party.<br />Kudos again to him for showing some of the distorted thinking processes that go into perpetuating things such as Afrocentric interpretations of history.

This was written by a man who teaches popular piano and has a very clear idea of the rhythm patterns that make that unique. For example: He makes extensive use of the tie line and syncopation in his examples of R&B, which is what one finds in real music of this genre. But it is very hard to get that type of practice if learning classical songs.<br />As it has been noted before, the binding for this book sucks. But there are ways to get around that.<br />Also: This seems to encompass almost everything in other basic theory books that I have read/ own.  It has actually obviated my other theory/ rhythm books.  It will be a good saving of money to invest in this before any others.<br />Finally: The book CAN be used by beginners (in tandem with learning some scales) if it is used as he recommends. He says in the opening pages that it was written/ designed to be used by people at myriad levels.	2002-09-08

Precursor to today's militant black escapists	This books is quite overrated, though it has been in print for a long time.<br /><br />The author neglected to put any citations of anything in the book, so far as I have read. I mean, *not one* single page of citations/ footnotes. Nor did he stick on some specific topic and go about addressing that, as opposed to writing in terms of sweeping generalities. Not helpful.<br /><br />I KNOW that this will be fodder for Black Studies Departments across the country and it is going to be yet another one of the things that makes the problems in black education WORSE.<br /><br />If this book were acceptable as authenticated information about what really DID happen in black education up to the time of publishing, it would be a guide to explain what is happening to this very day.<br /><br />As it is, I can't see it as much more than the prototype to some of the foolishness that infects the discourse on black education today.<br /><br />A better choice to read would be [[ASIN:1461036461 Up From Slavery: An Autobiography]]by Booker T. Washington. His diagnosis was accurate and speaks to things that are still happening today (as in, black people not realizing that the purpose of education is to improve earnings potential and not something that is done for its own sake is what accounts for their lower educational return on investment).	2002-08-31

One can selectively abstract the parts of interest, and a very good index/ thematic organization is helpful in so doing. What strikes me about this book is not the flashing brilliance of the author as opposed to his affinity for finding historical precedent for things.<br />It is well known about the Paternalistic character of Asian societies, and this book is still more evidence of that.<br />One has to read what he writes very carefully. He is trained to deliver information in the way of politicians (read: obfuscated), and that is clear.<br />Take two small examples: He thinks that Singapore is the most successful CHINESE society in the last 5,000 years (by including a statement made by another author to that effect). Lots of hidden things there. There has been a functioning state in China for about half that time. But why bother with detail? Another thing that he tends to downplay in his rush toward self-aggrandizement is the fact that the country had a something like a functioning government there to begin with (the British), and that they had gone a long way toward getting the country stabilized and getting people into the habit of living under a government (unlike, say, Indonesia).<br />He also quotes the work of \\"R.H.Herrnstein,\\" and identifies him as a support. It just so happens that that is the co-author of THE BELL CURVE. He is very cautious in containing the traditional Chinese chauvinism, but that and his program to ensure reproduction of \\"survival of the fittest\\" smacks of eugenics. This is interesting in light of the fact that he used historical examples from different parts of the world where output was higher or lower based on ecnomic policies. He is so vague about coming out and saying that that is what he was insinuating, one wonders what other things could one have missed in the other 700 pages.<br />On the good side: This book deals in AUTHENTICATED knowledge. During his discourse on creating a \\"fair\\" society (as opposed to a \\"welfare\\" socity), he does not draw on silly academic theories. Instead he looks at the same thing that happened in another place (Britain and many other parts of Western Europe), and makes his decision based on the mistakes of others. His narrative of things that he has observed in various countries and explanation of WHY they are they way they are would be very good for people who like to imagine that economic data/ mathematics can explain everything.*<br />A lot of people have written books about the problems encountered in doing business in China (to which he devoted much space). He did not talk about the specific numbers associated with Chinese growth, but he did talk about the fundamental problems that the Singaporeans had doing business, which were (among others): Weak/ non-existent enforcement of contracts and excessive bureaucratic inertia. Interesting how on one hand hints at his restrained (typically Chinese) sense of superiority. But in the chapters about China he (in the careful way that a politician can) blowtorches many of the faults/ missteps of the country.<br />He gives a good detailed explanation of the way Singapore's economic system works. For example: How can a country with such a high GDP Percapita have such low salaries? Because of the siphoning off of the citizens salaries by the CPF. This also explains the large trade surplus (because high domestic savings will promote a large trade surplus). How did he manage to foster national unity between people who apparently had nothing in common? And why is the government so nervous to control EVERYTHING there?<br />Other than that, if you want to get an idea of what Singapore is like, this is a good (if long) start.

The book loses one-half star based on the author's insistence on using parenthetical phrases in every other paragraph. And the other one-half star is for his vocabulary: It could have been toned down just a skosh.  There is no need for so many words to make a point that can be explained in a simpler way.<br />The idea of the book was supposed to be a synopsis of EVERYTHING of significance that has happened over the last millenium. When considered that people have written entire books just about the Reconstruction period of the United States (and still left issues open to question), can it reasonably be expected that the author will be able to explore every single detail of every issue that he raised in the book? Not likely.<br />If this book is understood to be an alternative to some of the theses presented by the likes of Murray, Herrnstein, Jensen, Rushton, and Lee Kwan Yew (i.e., some people are inherently genetically inferior and they DESERVE their failure), then it serves its purpose very well.  And that is to show that societies are very complicated institutions and that myriad possibilities exist that can derail their potential for vertical mobility. Kudos to the author for explaining to the uninformed (of which I happen to not be one in this case) about China's smothering hubris as a reason for its decline over the last 900 years.<br />In fact, it can be read in a much less demanding way just to get a general idea of what happened in some particular period (i.e., the labor unions and class divisions in the United Kingdom that he feels led to a lot of their decline), with authors who are SPECIALISTS in that field to fill in the details/ construct the arguments and counterarguments.<br />With that understanding, this book can be taken in the spirit in which it was meant.	2002-08-31

There was also a lot of attention paid to details that made you believe that he was writing a biography. Examples:<br />1. His mother had what may have been Alzheimer's disease, which is known to have a genetic component. The main character shares the same fate at the end of the book. There are (to my recollection) no direct scenes with the characters' mother, and she could have been eliminated with no damage to the book. But she may have been there just to establish that link.<br />2. The pace at which the character starts to forget things increases throughout the book, foreshadowing his collapse into Alzheimer's at the end.<br />3. The accurate/ humorous portrayal of what really became of a lot of the black militants, portrayed through the character of Cedric.  And his observations of the belligerence of the feminists.<br />4. The use of the epilogue (Barney's son), and real historical references, such as newspaper clippings to provide an air of believability to the novel.	2002-08-24

Kudos to Becker for his placement of the Chinese in historical context. The book is worth its salt if for no other part than the 20 page introduction that gives a synopsis of the Chinese state. And this book could have been written by no one other than someone who had observed every day life in China for a period of ten years. Even after all this, he is still good about admitting that the place eludes generalization.<br />I've just finished living in China and have found that many of the things that he says are correct. For example: He mentions that the cities are among the most prosperous places and that the rich people live there as they always have.  The further one goes from the city centers, the more obvious the real picture is.<br />He makes some very prescient observations about the affinity of the Chinese for tyrants and their love of all-controlling, authoritarian regimes.  If the CCP collapsed tomorrow, the citizenry wouldn't know what to do with itself if history is any guide.<br />Everyone also seems to think that China is going to take over the world in the near future. After reading the details of the book, one wonders: &quot;Is this really consistent with what you would expect from such a situation as he describes?&quot;<br />One or two things that are missing that were covered in later publications--by different authors: What happens in the case where there is a large peasantry that feels that their taxes are being extracted to support the wealthy? What happens when there is a huge excess of men to women in a particular country? At the beginning of the book, he said that he was not going to offer a book about political ideology. But it would have been nice if he had drawn just a few more parallels between what happened in other places under similar circumstances. (This story has been told many times before; Only the players are different.)<br />Actually, there are too many good observations to even address within the word limit of the reviews. One other that is too good to resist noting is the Chinese concept of &quot;race,&quot; as it was taught many years ago by Sun Yat Sen (Chinese and White are superior and all others are inferior, thus the Chinese race must regenerate itself or risk extinction) that is still very much believed in Taiwan and colors certain notions/ statements that one hears in every day life there as well as in the Mainland.<br />Lastly, he could have shaved about 75 pages off the book and it would not have been diminished in any way. When dealing with such large amounts of factual information as he put in the book, shorter is always better. In any case, there is very little that I disagree with in this book and most people (especially Sinophiles and other romantics) would do very well to read this book and understand what it demonstrates.ther that is too good to resist noting is the Chinese concept of &quot;race,&quot; as it was taught many years ago by Sun Yat Sen (Chinese and White are superior and all others are inferior, thus the Chinese race must regenerate itself or risk extinction) that is still very much believed in Taiwan and colors certain notions/ statements that one hears in every day life there as well as in the Mainland.<br />Lastly, he could have shaved about 75 pages off the book and it would not have been diminished in any way.

As someone who did the whole \\"Live and Teach in China\\" thing, I was impressed by the quality of his writing.<br />The bad points:<br />1. Unresolved characters: Who was the girl with whom he took a bike ride? Is this the one that later became his wife? What ever happened to the teacher? Did he die before the book was published?<br />2. Overly-romantic view of some Chinese cultural habits that would would consider inappropriate: 1. Lying; 2.Obsession with rules and regulations about things; 3. Narrowness<br />3. Self absorption: Was he really a kung-fu master? Was it all in his own head? Was his Chinese really that good after an undergraduate degree?<br />Good points:<br />1. The fact that he actually wrote about the book as someone who was aware of his surroundings.  Most who go to China hear the Chinese repeat the line about how great they are SO MANY TIMES, that they actually start to believe it.<br />2. Observsation of how out of touch people tend to be with reality, thanks to the CCP's propaganda machine. This book was written nearly 20 years ago and it is no less accurate now than then.  People still think that Mao's army defeated the Japanese and ran them out of China.  And, more generally, they still rewrite all the history books to say what they want them to say.	2002-08-19

Needed about 1/2 the pages used	This book read more like a Danielle Steele novel. I didn't expect her to mimic Margaret Mitchell's style, of course.  But I wasn't to keen to read this, either.<br />Weaknesses:<br />1. Too long (If you've ever read anything by Ayn Rand, you know that it is possible to assert very little in a huge amount of space.  If you've not read her, then this will be yet another clear example of that.)<br />2. Too corny (Those scenes full of redheads, all of whom have larger than life characters and are part of a *big, loving, communal family* were just a bit over the top.)<br />3. Too unrealistic (Scarlett O'Hara as a sponsor of early form of the IRA? Scarlett O'Hara moving to Ireland and building and empire?)<br />4. Dabbling with the supernatural. Huh?<br />Strengths:<br />This book was loosely historically based, and did give an indication of what has created the rage of the Irish toward their being governed by the British for such a long time.

A nation is a \\"debtor nation\\" when foreigners purchase a lot of its assets. But this debt is more similar to what happens when you put money IN the bank. For every deposit, the bank goes deeper into debt because people feel safe parking their assets there. This is similar to the USA, where foreigners feel comfortable putting their assets here, necessarily resulting in a trade deficit. Until very recently, over 90% of the US trade deficit was driven by capital investment.<br /><br />2. Trade deficits are ONLY contingent on the level of domestic savings and investment.  In the case that the latter is greater than the former, a trade deficit will result. Note that in the last several years of Japan's economic crisis, the trade surplus has actually *increased.* People in Japan are finding anyplace else to put their money but Japan, and the trade surplus is the result of that and not the cause.<br /><br />3. Many authors have pointed out that capital and labor productivity in the USA are a LOT higher than they are in Japan. The system of keiretsu has actually resulted in Japan's having a significantly *lower* domestic productivity than in the US.  And as we all know, the ultimate determiner of standards of living is productivity-- NOT exchange rates. When looked at in terms of productivity, the US standard of living is about 50% higher than what it is in Japan.<br /><br />4. Some have made the case that Japan's exporting industries, which really WERE subject to market discipline developed in spite of (and not because of) the keiretsu system.

This lengthy document of some of the snafus of people that were managing HUNDREDS of millions of dollars of investors' money is a testament to exactly how rare knowledge really is. And how much of a role psychology plays in the market. And how true the adage \\"Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it\\" is.<br />Currently, I am living here and find that the behavior of the people here is accurately represented by this work and could have been predicted based on some of the historical evidence that is given by Studwell. It is obvious that he has a good, sharp mind and has paid attention to his subject material.<br />I've often heard phrases such as: \\"We Chinese have invented words for every thing because of our long history and we don't need to invent more.\\" Or, \\"The American government lies to you too, and is just as afraid of a revolution as ours is.\\" And on and on and on.  The mentality of the people here is very stubbornly fixated in the 12th century and is not likely to change anytime soon. It is with this understanding that the author goes on to describe the Chinese customs that make this reality possible--even now, people here think that Beijing and Shanghai are the financial capitals of the world because of what the government tells them.<br />The one weakness of the book is that he doesn't devote a whole chapter to describing the cultural aspects alone. And this was perhaps a conscious decision because the perception of a culture is not reproducible from person to person-- although I will admit that all that he has said has been consistent with my observation. It would be easy to predict what he observes if you could just understand the cultural context in which these things take place.<br />It might also have been nice if he had drawm some parallels with the nervousness that the Soviet Union created in the USA.  (It may be that I am going overboard with my \\"could've/should've\\"s, as just the documentation of this must have taken FOREVER. It is mind boggling that one person could find so much and keep SO abreast of what was happening.)<br />It is prudent to underline several things of which he has a mature understanding:<br />1. The essence of Chinese culture is FORM OVER SUBSTANCE. So he correctly notes that the government has spent a lot of time on making people believe that they were going to get returns that they weren't. This explains why people will repeat things a large number of times to convince themselves (and others) that it is true.<br />2. The obsession of this place with control. The government here has to be in charge of EVERYTHING. And, as to the first observation, they will not reveal the full extent of their control.<br />3. The mechanism by which a lot of the \\"guan-xi\\" money is distributed. (The hiring of consultants that are children of government officials who have sway-- or at least seem to.)<br />4. That nasty little sense of superiority that makes the Chinese destructively delimit everything into a Chinese/ Non-Chinese (and therefore inferior) way of doing things. Effectively, this makes the number of transactions that would take place in a properly functioning market much lower.<br />5. The extremely poor understanding of basic economics and its confusion with the other \\"social theater games\\" that they like to play here. Everyone seems to think that if we just believe it hard enough, then it is true. And most importantly how these wildly inaccurate ideas have been implemented as public policy by a government that is NOT subject to feedback mechanisms.<br />On the negative side: The documentation of the book was thorough, but it was just TOO MUCH and made the book rather heavy. Also lacking was a more detailed comparison of the parallels of this with Japan.  They did some of the same things and went down the same roads that China is going down now--although with much more reliable enforcement of contracts/ transparency. And during the 1980s, the Americans bought right into the things published by Japanese think-tanks set up in the USA and created the same sense of hysteria. But when everything was revealed in time (as it usually is), then people understood the folly of their ways.<br />But for all his clear writing, most people will probably never even hear of the book. They are going to have to waste investor's funds and learn the hard way.ublished by Japanese think-tanks set up in the USA and created the same sense of hysteria.

One author assumed that all the data was correct as given and challenged its relevance.<br />Most importantly, one of the articles used the mathematics associated with these social experiments and asked &quot;Do these numbers really show you what you think they do?&quot; In all of my exhaustive reading about this subject, this book is the first that I have read that specifically addresses that point.<br />While lots of people have dismissed the proponents of genetic inferiority as an explanation for the &quot;failure&quot; of blacks in the USA, the rebuttals have invariably failed to contront the reasoning of the authors, preferring to dismiss them out of hand as &quot;racist.&quot;<br />One thing that was lacking in this book is a more detailed analysis of the disparity between ethnic groups of the same race-- and yes, they do exist, contrary to what you would believe from reading the newspapers.  For this, one of two Thomas Sowell books is a good read. The first: &quot;Race and Culture.&quot; The second: &quot;Knowledge and Decisions.&quot;<br />Unfortunately, the use of lots of technical jargon is going to put this fine piece of literature out of the reach of the vast majority of the hoi polloi.	2002-05-02

The article discussing the fact that the mean IQ for whites is merely an amalgamation of averages of different subgroups of whites.<br />2. The article discussing some points about how the Bell Curve made sales because it had such a large audience that WANTED to see it written.<br />If this book is taken in the spirit in which it was meant (which was not necessarily a series of mathematical, rigorous articles as opposed to some discussions of the social aspects of the measurement of IQ), then an intelligent reader can understand that the research into IQ is not totally disinterested and without a social component as well.<br />For those desiring an elegant mathematical analysis of the issue, read Meritocracy and Economic Inequality.	2002-05-02

I have read about 12 of Thomas Sowell's books now, give or take.  They do tend to be over-wrought with detail, but in this case it may be that he really did need as many pages as he used to say what he did and could have used more by filling in specific examples.<br />Kudos to Sowell for using the very accurate idea of *social behavior* as a basis for explaining intergroup difference (rather than something so tenuous as IQ), and the separation of the actions of specific agencies from &quot;society.&quot;  Most writers do not bother to clearly delimit their operational terms and working notions.  Also particularly clever was his observation of how institutions work as a matter of *self-interest* and create problems because it is in their best interest to have these problems.<br />The book must be read LINE by LINE. When he uses some of his very abstract statements to characterize a social process it is often NOT filled in with details. A theme that appears in many of his books is: &quot;If it has happened once, it will happen again independent of settings.&quot; While you go through and read some of his statments, you will have to think back through your experiences of life and see if you have seen the same situation. And THAT is what makes this book take such a long time to read--expect it to take a month if read properly.<br />The index is excellent and I found it particularly useful for referencing subjects like black IQ research and things like that. Well researched if nothing else, and it goes a LONG way in explaining current situations by extrapolations of things in the book itself.<br />Perhaps it could have been made just a bit easier to read. Again: this is NOT light reading, and while it is chock full of information, it is WAY over the heads of most people.<br />This book is *required reading* for young black Americans.  If paid careful attention to, it will do great things to break some of the bad habits that have infected us for a long time now.  Really, it is a good book for any people who are looking for concrete reasons for group differences.  And maybe in the case of the readers who would be the greatest beneficiaries of it (black Americans, from my view), it would undo some of the damage caused to young Blacks by Black Studies departments across the nations.<br />Feel free to email me with any questions/ comments.it is a good book for any people who are looking for concrete reasons for group differences.
