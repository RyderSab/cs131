He told me that he already had quite enough problems in life, thank you.<br />Honestly, this book promotes cruelty to both women and men. <br />Cruelty to women in the obvious form, by making them utterly unprepared to cope with life in any form except by roping men into looking out for them - and woe betide if you get dumped or become a young widow, since logic, training for a practical career, and learning basic financial planning all seem to be verboten on account of they'll make your husband's manlihood wilt and fall off.<br />Cruelty to men by creating women who expect to be taken care of and protected and who will basically serve as dead weight or an extra child in any relationships they enter, leaving the men with twice the stress and responsibility.<br />The only possible redeeming argument for all this nonsense is that people who believe it deserve what they get, but even that doesn't fly when there are children involved, especially daughters who might be prevented from getting the education they'll need to survive later in life.	2003-01-21

Some parts were downright weak (I'm thinking here of the scene wherein we are introduced to the spinsterish, bookish, middle-aged heroine.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but it blatantly didn't fit here.  Methinks the author was under the impression that it was important to work in a description of her as quickly as possible. To be fair, he also worked in a physical description of the male lead as early as possible, and with equal awkwardness.)  The ending was kind of... well, without spoiling, the most I can say is that you have seen this ending before, even if you've been living in outer Kurdistan.  <br />This was all the more disappointing as the middle tantalizingly held out the possibility of a really surprising twist, and kept the suspense going.  Suspense was definitely the strong point of the novel.  The opening scenes, with the 'Something is murdering my men' hook, were quite good.  The concept of a battle, not really between good and evil, but in trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils has a lot of real-world resonance.<br />Overall:  Actually, I would recommend this one for a snack, but I'm being harsh with it because it could have been much more.	2001-07-13

Interesting topic, but I can't recommend the book because of an abysmal lack of footnoting, overall disorganization, and persistent refusal to translate quotes in antiquated Scots into readable English.  Has some nice pictures of mortsafes, though.	2001-07-13

As Anne Lamott's Bird by Bird, John Gardner's Art of Fiction and On Becoming a Novelist, Stephen King's On Writing, and many more.  This book is just another hybrid memoir/advice book.  Not that this is necessarily bad (nor necessarily good) but the title is definitely deceptive.<br />Compared to the books I just mentioned, I definitely found this one below average.  The information regarding latinate vs. Anglo-Saxon words gets a bit more thorough covering than in John Gardner, which is really nice, and if I could have bought just that chapter I would have, but listening to Ms. Brown's rather annoying social opinions for the rest of the book made it just not worth it - not for this Yankee anyway.	2001-05-18

The author has really picked a fascinating subject, and brings it to life, weaving together strands of economics, sociology, geography, and chemistry to explain some of the impacts that these now-commonplace items have had on Western culture.  (And what impacts our culture has had on the items - did you know that chocolate was a drink for monks and aristocrats before it became a snack for children?)<br />But the book is far too short.  Many subjects are merely glanced over, and the illustrations, in addition to being so numerous as to be suspected of being filler, are often dark and hard to make out.  I would have rather seen the author do a book this size on any one of the various subjects at hand - just coffee, say, or just pepper - and really explored it in depth.	2001-05-09

Though in a broad sense this book covers the same ground as the also-excellent _The Blind Watchmaker_, this one is less stridently argumentative in tone and consequently somewhat more accesible to the non-biologist.  It also introduces a new metaphor for the process of evolution towards complexity, the titular Mount Improbable, which I find far superior to either the Blind Watchmaker (derived from and therefore permenantly bound to old Creationist arguments) or the author's much-beloved computer programs.  The museum of hypothetical shells is another great addition to the annals of thought-experiment.<br />Another aspect of this book's greatness is the way in which Mr. Dawkin's love for biology, both in the sense of the study of living things and in the sense of the living things themselves, shows on nearly every page.  Where in The Blind Watchmaker he often seemed angry (albeit rightfully so), here he is equally often simply enraptured by the sheer beauty of evolution and the products thereof.  It's easy to see that this guy is a true naturalist, and his enthusiasm is infectious.<br />Now I move along to _Unweaving the Rainbow_ with high hopes and much anticipation.	2001-05-07

Al Hoff's #1 gift is her ability to bring to life the intangible thrill of the hunt that is the narcotic base of the thrift-store game.  Her writing is so good that she could easily get by on style and no substance, but her #2 gift is to use the first gift to impart actual information.

It's no scholarly look at juvenile crime, and the cover is a design atrocity, but this account of a little-known member of the confraternity of youthful murderers does fill in an unfortunate gap in the public's collective memory.<br />The negatives: very little by way of footnotes, or indeed any other means by which the interested researcher can check up on the author's facts.  An intrusive tendency (noted in another review below) to ascribe feelings and thoughts that could not possibly be known to characters who are long dead.  <br />The positives: a fascintating and timely (without being faddish) subject, a writing style that transcends the cruder illiteracies often encountered in popular nonfiction, and tantalizing hints of context (including the murders of the Joyce siblings and Mabel Young) that are extremely helpful.	2001-04-27

This book is definitely not what you would call fun to read, but it is a stirring and important document.  The author commits a few infelicities of language (for which I would have deducted the quarter-star if I could) but keeps the narrative tension high and sheds a lot of light for this Yankee girl on the kind of culture that made a man like Medger Evers loyal to the state of Mississippi even though it was a state that would allow his murderer to go unpunished for decades.  It doesn't gloss over the warts of those on the side of the angels, and although it doesn't fully explain the psychology of the assassin, perhaps no one can.	2001-03-05

This 'popular science' type book shows valient effort, but doesn't entirely manage to avoid the traps.<br />It does have good points, to be sure.  It is approachable for the non-scientist, both in language and in concept.  It does attempt to show some balance by presenting plants as victims of herbivores, as well as herbivores as victims of carnivores.  It elucidates the various theories of the evolutionary backgrounds of predator-prey adaptations pretty clearly.<br />However, in an attempt to be gripping, the book delves into shameless anthropomorphism and value-laden language, especially in the narrative portions.  Despite the fact (clearly stated in the explanatory portions of the book) that even a good predator on a good day succeeds in less than fifty percent of hunting attempts, a predator is 'shown' missing a prey animal only once (and even then the predator goes on to catch a different animal.)  As a result, the 'story' parts of the book create a misapprehension that the more 'scientific' sections include an obligatory protest against - namely, that the predator is a killing machine with an almost moral quality, engaged in a daily slaughter of the innocents.  Even the title plays into this misapprehension: No raptor is shown eating a lamb in the course of the book - indeed few raptors are even capable of preying on lambs - and no lambs are shown being eaten by any other predators either; but in our language the rapicious raptor and the innocent, fluffy lamb create a much greater emotional impact than, say, the shark and the seal or the lion and the wildebeast.	2000-11-20

Stephen King, who has always to my taste been better at non-fiction than at fiction, avoids the pitfalls laid by pretension at the feet of the reflective.  Only in the last section did I find any trace of self-centeredness, and considering the subject matter there is the car accident that nearly killed the author not very long ago, some lapses are certainly understandable!<br />King's recounting of his life and career are fascinating and vividly told, and for the most part his advice on writing is laid out in the form of 'this is what is right for me' rather than 'this is THE right way'.  Where he does dogmatize, he falters.  But he falters very rarely for a writer that many people would condemn as a hack.	2000-11-20

The cover blurbs of the copy I have make much of how 'horrifying' and 'brilliant' this book is, going so far as to compare it to Umberto Eco. I find it to be closer to the work of, say, Susan Kay.<br />Don't get me wrong, this book is entertaining. The concept of the scent-master is (as far as I know) quite original, and the theme is carried out consistently throughout the book. The author has a sharp eye for detail and is not afraid to stray from his plot for an interesting digression, which is always nice to see (myself, I would that he had more discretion in deciding what subjects qualified as 'interesting' but that is a matter of taste.)<br />However, the characterization of the mass murderer as an amoral, asocial creature with delusions of grandeur is frankly overdone. It belongs in a Johnny the Homicidal Maniac comic. Worse, the author can never quite seem to decide how much irony he wants to lay on, sometimes seeming embarassingly earnest, other times plunging his story into ridiculousness with a wink (Ok, we get it! Everyone who interacts with your main character is going to come to a bad end! How clever.)<br />As for the supposedly shocking and horrifying nature of this book, a heap of corpses does not true horror make. By refusing to allow any empathy for any of his doomed characters, the author may be trying to force us to take the point of view of his sociopathic protagonist, but in reality, he dries up the source of most of the potential emotional impact of the final chapters. The climax and finale are rushed, abrupt, and present a barely-surmountable temptation to skip ahead to the last page.<br />The overall impression I was left with was that the author studied so hard to be unsentimental that he fell over the edge into reverse sentimentality, a sort of simpering affection for nasty occurances not coupled with any real insight.	2000-11-08

If you take it seriously, you are doomed, because  the characters are paper-thin stereotypes, the action verges between the  merely ridiculous and the blatantly impossible, and the ending is about as  surprising as a sunset in the west of an evening.<br />Dave Barry is not a  literary artist.  What Dave Barry is, however, is a master parodist, an  expert in the fine art of piling together absurdities (both in the plot and  in the verbiage) until you laugh out loud.  Although the laugh-out-loud per  page ratio in this book is not as high as in some of Dave's better columns,  that's understandable, because he had to cover a lot more ground here.  It  certainly is more entertaining than most more 'serious'  action-adventure-caper type books.<br />This book is an excellent choice for  the beach, plane, or while babysitting.	2000-08-23

In some of 'his' books, Bob Larson is entertaining though clearly misinformed and possibly completely fruitloops.  However, this time around  it would appear that Bob opted for the budget ghostwriting service.  <br />The  raw materials are promising.  We get a panting description of the Heavan's  Gate suicides (a clear indication that the book was meant to be a  throw-away effort linked to the headlines, rather than the results of '20  years of research'); a typically self-stroking account of Bob's appearence  on Oprah; some side-swipes at New Agey UFO cultists and mainstream  scientists alike; and a grainy photo of some dead cows.  <br />It surely would  seem that Weird Bob could do something wacky with this stuff, but the prose  is workmanlike at best and frankly unreadable in spots.<br />Of particular  note in this mess is a paragraph in Chapter Four in which Bob accuses  Hollywood of waffling on the issue of whether space aliens are good or  evil.  Behold, sayeth Bob, in E.T. the alien is good, and in Independence  day it is evil!  Hollywood flip-flops!  What kind of point he is trying to  make I don't know, but for a moment Bob confronts one of his major  fallacies: that the entertainment industry is a united front attempting to  seduce Christian children.  For Bob, to see 'Hollywood' the entity disagree  with itself is to face the Void of his own dishonest worldview, and Bob  blinks first.  The chapter wanders off to discuss Elvis sightings on Uranus  (!) and the book never regains what equilibrium it ever had.<br />Over all,  this book is one to miss if you possibly can.	2000-08-23

Evocative of much great fantasy of the past (and dealing with  many of the same themes of intergenerational power, love, loss, and  vengeance), it tells a solid and exciting story on its own terms while at  the same time setting up the characters and situations for the rest of the  series very nicely.<br />Rowling's prose, while hardly high-flying, has the  gift of grabbing readers quite effectively by the emotions and the  imagination.

The characters are well drawn, the  more barbaric aspects of primitive life are not flinched from, and though  some found them tedious I must admit that I enjoyed the 'scholarly'  material in the introduction, footnotes, and appendix.  The handling of the  'dragon' was a nice touch.<br />The fault that prevents this book from getting  five stars from me, though, is that the climax is rather underwritten.   After all the difficulties, terrors, and carnage inflicted by the  mist-monsters it seems that the final confrontation is over too  quickly.<br />Other than that, this is a fun little book.	2000-08-04

Today we all know the people who cry 'I'm in love'  while inflicting only pain on the loved one, or who destroy children and  families because of some perceived wrong.  But at the time this book was  written, it was not common to focus a novel on a pair of lovers with the  understanding that those lovers were, in fact, jerks.  The way Bronte  alternately panders to 'romance' conventions with craggy Heathcliff and  wayward Catherine and then spits in the face of those conventions by  showing the effeminate, willowy Edgar to be the closest thing to a decent  adult character in the book is refreshing for those of us who are tired of  the dominance of the alpha male.<br />In passing, I must also mention that  between the stormy moors, the borderline necrophilia, and the grandiose  tooth-gnashing spurned-lover angst, this is a very goth book, which never  hurts from my point of view.<br />The other part of the equation is that  (despite the protestations of certain reviewers) Bronte keeps the suspense  high throughout the book.  Between worrying about the fate of young Cathy,  waiting for the ghost to make another appearance, and eagerly anticipating  the moment when Heathcliff gets his, there's hardly a slack moment.<br />I  must say that the ending was not, in my opinion, as strong as it could have  been, but I'll speak of it no more so as not to spoil it.  Hence, only four  stars.	2000-08-01

I certainly was.  After a disappointing introduction to the legendary New  Orleans author through the weak Violin, I was only interested in reading  Interview because of its role in promoting the vampire revival of the 90's.   I thought that reading it would be an act of research and contrition.  I  was wrong.<br />This is a strong, lush, and original (at the time, though  much-imitated today) piece of writing.  The blend of the erotic and the  horrific is true to the spirit of the original Dracula.  The attention to  detail that would become so over-the-top in Rice's later books is  well-balanced and poetic here.  The characters are at once individual and  mythic (though admittedly some of them are a little given to navel-gazing.)  The dilemma of the child-vampire is an excellent addition.  If you are  interested in horror, in vampires, or simply in a good read, you should try  this book.	2000-07-07

However, I  believe that expressing the problem in gendered terms is a short-sighted  and rather patronizing mistake (Albiet the same complaint could be  expressed against books that claim to examine the plight of boys.)<br />To put  it bluntly, various isms (including sexism but also racism, classism, and  especially ageism), social expectations, and the current school system  conspire to make adolescence a confusing and toxic experience for nearly  all teens, no matter which 'bits' they were born with.  Girls AND boys are  suffering from being forced into social straightjackets, from excessively  strict and/or detached parents, from mixed sexual signals, rape and  exploitation, and from cruelly undervaluing expectations in the classroom.   These issues need to be addressed across the board and not turned into one  more subject in which we pit boys against girls.	2000-06-28

At the same time, it is rather depressing (though not  without hope of redemption at hand.)  It is especially valuable for the way  it portrays the daily discipline of writing and selling one's work.<br />Of  course, all is not bleakness and navel-gazing in this book.  We also see  the beauty of the author's rural home, and the quiet joy of day-to-day life  with his wife and dogs.  (Though why must he be so jarring as to refer to  his wife by an initial?  If she wanted to keep her privacy, an unlikely  goal at best when your husband is writing a memoir, she could have been  called by a pseudonym.)<br />Overall, this is definitely a good read, though  not exactly 'fun'.	2000-06-27

Everyone should know the sources of the things they are interested in.  <br />With that said, compared to the sources of  other legendary horror films (particularly the original Dracula and  Frankenstein novels) this book does not hold up well as a piece of literary  art.  It is largely a melodrama, the equivalent of today's Grisham or  Steele novel.  Though it doubtless had entertainment value in its time, it  is rather dated to modern eyes.	2000-06-27

Lewis's best qualities come to the fore - his way with words, his gentleness, his sense of humor, and his imagination.  This slender volume outshines all his 'non-fiction' and even (difficult  though it may be to believe) his justly acclaimed Narnian Chronicles.  The  premise of a correspondence in Hell allows him to cover a wide variety of  topics very quickly and accomodates his rather emotive style of  logic.<br />The accompanying essay, 'Screwtape Proposes a Toast', is weaker,  being rather preachy.  However, it is still quite enjoyable as a quick  read.	2000-06-27

In this book he cheerfully claims that he never  thought such a foolish thing.  Instead he focuses on the sexuality and  personal habits of various rock stars.  As amusing as it is to read, this  book stands as a monument to Mr. Larson's entire career of riding whatever  scare-horse has been popular in fundamentalist circles, from rock music and  Eastern religions in the '60s to UFOs, Marilyn Manson, and school shooting  today.	2000-06-27

Gira has a talent that might almost be called a gift for coming up with fascinating, vivid, and almost inevitably macabre scenarios for his short stories.  Unfortunately, he seems to have trouble figuring out just exactly  where to go with them sometimes.   He also can't seem to get through a  sentence without tossing in at least one gratuitous metaphor - a problem  common among musicians who have honed their writing skill on lyrics, since  lyrics are much closer to poetry than to prose in most cases.  With  practice and a firm-handed editor I predict better things, short story  wise, from Mr. Gira.	2000-06-25

But that is only fitting considering the source material.<br />The great triumph  of this book is how it weaves together such a variety of incident, from the  provincial French town Eric's birth to Rome, Russia, and the court of a  middle eastern potentate, and then inevitably back to the basement of the  Paris Opera House, while making every step of the journey contribute to the  climax that was imposed on the author by her sources.

A few of his ideas are based on mistaking the cultural norms of his time for absolute biological fact, and  therefore are not as likely to work today, but others are liable to work on  the majority of people (though, it is important to remember, not all)  yesterday, today, and forever.  As with all of LaVey's writing, the key to  making The Satanic Witch work for you is to read with an open but critical  mind, forging your own path through his material.	2000-06-01

Nevertheless, this is the best book I have seen for the new, young, or lonely atheist.<br />Mr. Russell writes with  a great deal of simplicity and gentle British good humor.  He attacks  beliefs (especially the belief in God's and Christ's inherent goodness and  in the sexual mores of his day) rather than people, by and large, which is  the mark of a truly humane person.  <br />Unlike many modern philosophers his  arguments do not require an advanced degree or even an advanced vocabulary  to follow.  And because the book is made up of fairly short essays on a  variety of subjects rather than one long argument, it can be read at  leisure without losing the thread of discussion.<br />Overall, I highly  recommend this book for anyone with even a slight interest in the subject  matter at hand.	2000-05-23

However,  this book is perfect for the first-time cat owner or the person eager to  learn the basics of cat psychology and behavior.  It is not too complex for  even a bright child, but full of tidbits interesting enough to beguile most  adults.<br />Indeed, I would encourage first-time cat owners to get hold of a  copy of this book as quickly as they can.  Understanding what your cat is  'saying' to you is half the fun.	2000-05-22

Celebrity gossip about Percy  and Byron is used to fill in extra pages - again interesting, but not what  the cover promised.  <br />Overall, this was not the book I'd hoped for, a  book that explores the history of the mad scientist concept as thoroughly  as the vampire has been covered.  It may still be worth reading, but only  if you know what you're getting into.	2000-05-21

Firstly, it could have used more photographs, or at least captions  to clearly indicate which photographs were a result of which techniques so  that one doesn't have to read a whole page of text while trying to find a  quick reference.  Secondly, the author rather glibly assumes that one has  access to patient friends who can paint murals and make stained glass for  free.  This may be a reasonable assumption in Manhatten, but it certainly  isn't in Podunk USA and those in Podunk also want to live well.<br />(I must  confess that I was also baffled at how everyone seemed to have a landlord  who was perfectly okay with having the ceiling painted, the overhead light  fixtures replaced, and the walls embellished with mouldings.  Is it only in  college towns that slumlords want their slums back in more-or-less the same  condition they were rented out in?)<br />But on the whole, The Paris Apartment  contains a wealth of jumping-of-points from which the active imagination  can conceive of marvelous things to do with even the most awkward room.	2000-05-18

Charles Fort is considered the venerable grandfather of anomalistic literature, and with good reason - his works are a fantastical Sears-Roebuck of frogs falling from the sky, rocks thrown by invisible  hands, spontaneous human combustion, and people who disappear and reappear  at random.  If you're going to be in the field at all, you should read your  Fort.<br />Of course, that's not to say that he's perfect.  Fort's  tongue-in-cheek message about science and the nature of reality is easy to  misunderstand, and he doesn't do anything to help the situation with a  dense, run-on prone style of prose.  For the researcher, his occasional  lack of documentation is also frustrating.  <br />All in all, though, this is  definitely a book worth checking out if you can find it.	2000-04-27

This is a distinguished researcher who can write like a best-selling journalist; a man who can address such  deeply fundamental human concerns as growing up, growing old, and finding a  god, and illustrate them with examples from baboon behavior, while not  seeming to trivialize the issue; a man with enough courage in his  observations to extend them into realms where science has been forbidden to  tread, yet with the honesty and modesty to always indicate where he is  uncertain, and even to include a rebuttal to one of his essays.

Usually the field of Satan-sniffing produces works filled with amusement, even hilarity, and massive evidence of human  credulity.  This book has only a vast vast number of Bible verses and a few  anecdotes so un-lurid that they wouldn't even interest Pastor Fletcher  Brothers on a dull day.  It does, however, provide a good groundwork for  understanding the philosophical basis of the fundy attitude towards demons  - if you happen to care.	2000-03-28

Her non-conformity gives rise to an occassion for her to be accused as a witch, and once accused,  she is doomed.  The real genius of this book is not in the plot per se   (though the addition of the lover who takes advantage of the situation to  convince Doll that she really is a witch and he as a demon is her appointed  mate is a plausible and original twist.  It is often overlooked that many  of the people who perished in the witch-crazes believed themselves to be  guilty, whether because of mental illness, infectious mass hysteria, or the   confusion brought about by their terror during interogation and  torture.)<br />But, as I was saying, the real genius in this book lies in the  narrative style and tone.  Esther Forbes makes the risky but ultimately  successful decision to structure this book like those of the era for which  the events of the plot would be recent past: readers of Defoe's Moll  Flanders will feel a jolt of recognition at many of the odd capitalizations  and lengthy chapter headings.  In keeping with this, the narrator appears  always to disapprove of the 'witch' and approve of the pious townspeople  who persecute her.  However, Forbes' skill is such that the underlying  message - that Doll has been entrapped and destroyed by prejudice,  superstition, and spite - is always clear in the subtle ironies of  situations.  The result is that the tone throughout is one of impending  doom, and the sense of the injustice done to Doll is far keener than it  might have been had the narrator railed against it.	2000-03-28

But, by god,  the dog grabs you.  Nothing can manipulate the emotions like a dog that's  friendlier, smarter, and more heroic than the rest of the characters put  together.  That, and the villain's highly lucid musings on interior  decorating, bring this out of the muddy Mississippi of Koontz's usual  cookie-cutter work and move it into his top three accomplishments (with  Dark Rivers of the Heart and Lightening.)	2000-03-05

On the other, you have fanatics who can  only relate to a concept of nature so pristine that it reveals underlying  self-hatred, and people who would sooner see California Condors extinct  than in captivity.<br />Botkin lucidly explains why both such views of nature  are based on misunderstandings and outdated cultural paradigms.  Using a  number of case studies and an accurate yet entertaining style, he points  the way toward a new conception of nature and the human role in it.	2000-03-05

I love the legends of the prophetess Cassandra, and even adopted her name as my own nom de plume.  So, I started out quite biased towards this telling over the more warrior-worshipping, male-centric standard retellings  of the Trojan War.  I wanted to like this book.<br />Unfortunately, the author  has a serious case of academic cramp.  A drier, less gripping account of a  woman scorned, raped, ripped from her homeland and her love, could not be  found.  Even I couldn't care about this Cassandra.<br />As for the essays,  they are about as lucid as a batch of Los Angeles rush-hour smog.  They  appear to be feminist, more or less, in a sort of cryogenically literary  way.<br />At first I was inclined to give the book two stars, because the idea  is good though the execution is sour.  Then I realized that by penning this  travesty the author stole the chance from all other writers to tell the  same story as it should be told.  Hence, I give this book the lowest of all  possible ratings.	2000-03-05

The good:  Some people genuinely are scared to write, and it's sure to be a comfort to them to know that some of the greats felt the same way.  Many of the anecdotes are very entertaining, and the writing style flows, making  for an easy read.  And the author, to his credit, gets no where near as  self-help schlocky as the title might seem to imply.<br />The bad: Not  everyone is scared to write, but you wouldn't know that from reading this  book.  There's nothing abnormal about a self-confident writer, and we don't  deserve the inference that brash writing is just a front.  Also, the book  puts way to much emphasis on writing as autobiographical confession.  Those  who prefer not to use that style may find little that they can directly  relate to.  Finally, the most genuine and significant fear involved in  writing - the fear that sets in after you've been rejected repeatedly - is  actually discussed relatively little.  <br />But, overall, if you have an  unstrained budget and a craving to know more about the writing life by all  means buy this book.	2000-02-23

Yes, most if not all of your first drafts will stink.  Yes, you're unlikely to get rich or even well-fed if you rely on fiction writing for your income.   Yes, you should be nice to yourself, and have the ability to laugh at  yourself at the end of the day.  It is, in fact, Ms. Lamott's sense of  humor about herself that saves this book.<br />But when you get past the  instructions for writing and into the instructions for life, even the humor  can't disguise the fact that our heroine is a monumentally neurotic sad  sack who can't make it through the day without a liberal dose of  divorcement from reality, whose idea of a deep statement is 'We are all  terminal cases on this bus', and who thinks that her toddler son is a great  source of Zen wisdom.  <br />There's no shame in this - a lot of great writers  are a bit crazy, and a lot of other people have the misfortune to be crazy  without even the consolation of being great writers.  But crazy writers  should stick to giving instruction on writing, and let sane people give  instructions on life.	2000-02-16

Mr. Gardner is (was) a hard-core literary snob.  He has no use for 'pornography', horror, science fiction, romance, or anything like that, and at times seems to view the whole purpose of  writing as more an extension of the practice of philosophy than as either  an art or a craft.<br />However, within that context he still has a lot of  good advice that any writer, including what Gardner would describe as a  'trash' writer, would do well to consider.  His chapters on fiction as the  art of producing a credible dream-like state in the reader are right on  target, and his discussion of the roots of various types of fiction (the  short story, the folkloric tale, etc.) are highly edifying.  His Helen of  Troy example of step-by-step story building could be used to add depth and  complexity to even the most straightforward of genre tales.<br />Overall, I  must give hearty approval to this book, even though I feel sure that the  author would not give hearty approval to me!	2000-02-16

All throughout the eighties, it grew, mutated, and spread like a cross between the most virulent urban legend and a cancer.  Now, at the dawn of a  new set of numbers on the cosmic odometer, the 'fact' that the normal  behavior of Satanists is to kill, molest, mutilate, and destroy has been  accepted by everyone from religious fanatics to police officers to some of  the would-be Satanists themselves.<br />  As a result, we are beginning to  reap the whirlwind of self-fulfilling prophecy, while innocent day-care  providers still languish in prison on false molestation charges and any kid  who dares to wear black to school is set upon by legions of counselors and  shrinks.<br />This book is the first and best rebuttal to the Satanic Network  Theory that I have come across.  If it were widely read it could do a lot  towards helping law enforcement officials avoid making jackasses of  themselves due to religious prejudice.	2000-02-16

This book is good in many aspects: It can be a powerful antidote for those who have never seen any but mainstream thoughts expressed before; it  can provide a channel for people who are seeking to increase the outlets  for power, control, and the 'evil' emotions in their life instead of  repressing themselves; it avoids the violent and illegal craziness that  cat-sacrificing, media (and Christian leader) promoted varieties of  'Satanism' may inspire; and it can provide grounds for a tasty lawsuit if  brought into the right public-school classroom.<br />However, in the long run,  the truly powerful option is to forge your own identity and philosophy in  life.  Therefore, while reading and even somewhat agreeing with this book  is fine, simply taking in its precepts hook, line, a sinker would prove to  be as much a mistake as doing the same for any other religion or school of  thought.	2000-02-15

Ron Hubbard knew it.... simplistic spirituality wrapped in a anti-dominant-culture stance to make it look new, bold, and innovative has always been catnip to those  unfortunate folks who just can't  restrain themselves from believing in  tooth fairies.  This book is a signpost along the road that the New Age has  taken from being primarily the realm of well-meaning but gullible hippies  to being primarily a capitalist concern for busy yuppies who want their  inner life, like their vitamin C and their fiber, in a pill.<br />Unlike  vitamin C and fiber, this contrived (though emotionally manipulative) plot  speckled with forgettable characters and those nine brilliant insights that  read like one of your better fortune cookies won't actually do you any  good.	2000-02-11

Disadvantaged, oppressed, sometimes  confused characters set out towards the distant horizon of opportunity, at  great risk to their personal and financial security.  In the course of  their journey they bond, learn about life, and discover strengths and  weaknesses in themselves and each other that they never even suspected.  Don't let the lack of covered wagons fool you.  This is the Great American  Pioneer Story, which every generation needs a version of for its  own.<br />Stylistically, this is quirky enough to be engaging, but by no means  difficult.<br />All in all, highly recommended	2000-02-11

Where Eco does err, he errs on the side of too  much idea and too little plot, but in the end, the balance comes out with a  fantastic climax.	2000-02-10

The  diversity of characterization and the clash of various fanatical ideals  makes for a good storyline.<br />That being said, it is a pity that the  publishers of this edition decided to include an essay, bound at the front  of the book, that totally gives away the only 'plot twist' worthy of the  name in the entire story.  This 'foreward' should have been placed after  the text.  Buy this book, but in a different edition.	2000-02-10

She's nailed the plot elements necessary to be hailed as a great dark artist in this end of the age - child abuse, dead moms and absent dads, detached sexy teenage girls,  philosophical/religious critique of the cult of the suburbs... I have  nothing against these elements in and of themselves, although some of them  are starting to be overdone.<br />Unfortunately, her style combines Anne  Rice's obsessive-compulsive love of irrelevant detail, the insistant  grimyness of a latter-day rock star, and a Joyce-esque refusal to clearly  distinguish thought from actuality, while lacking the redeeming gifts of  any of the above-mentioned artists.  <br />Darcey Steinke will probably write  something good someday, probably a short story.  Keep your eye out for  that.  Don't bother with this.	2000-02-10

Rather than being taken as definitive, it should be read along with some of the many other  books on writing offered by editors, non-fiction authors, best-selling  fiction authors, obscure literary authors, and so forth, to gain a  multifaceted few of the industry.  Used in such a manner, it is very  valuable.	1999-12-14

The title sums up my reaction to this work, and the reaction of everyone I passed it along to.  Mr. Godwin (who is (or was) published by Jack Chick, the master of the mini-comic tract) is much  given to misinterpretation,  misquoting, general cluelessness, and outright lies.  It's almost  impossible to believe that someone could maintain such an air of naivety  and unrealism, even for money, and downright sad to believe that others  would actually pay for it and believe it for real.	1999-12-12

Watson, M.D. (Norton Paperback)	Books	5	2	5	N	N	The best of the pseudo-Holmeses	What I truly admire in this book is how it deftly explains the improbable Moriarty of the original tales with an unexpected yet plausible twist - the sort of twist that every mystery story should have, though set at the  beginning of the book rather than the more traditional end.  The plot is  more compelling than the later 'Canary Trainer' and the characters more  believable within the context of Doyle's world.	1999-12-12

This book has often been recommended to me - admittedly ususally by teenagers and very naive persons - as the 'magic bullet' that will suddenly convince me of the need to become a Born-Again Christian.  Unfortunately,  the book suffers from the same problem that plagues the equally-highly  recommended tomes of C.S. Lewis, namely, it argues logic as far as it can  go (not very far,) then takes an enormus leap of faith and expects that you  will accept said leap as more logic, or just not notice.  This may indeed  work on children and the very naive, and on those who were predisposed by  childhood training to accept Christianity as favorable, but not on me.   Sorry.	1999-12-12

It didn't live up to my first taste of Saberhagen, and so disappointed me.... but as  a representative of the vampire and Holmesian genres, it's an original  entry and a pleasant light read.	1999-12-12

But presenting a combination of pig-ignorance and outright lies as a guide for raising and protecting children is beyond inexcusable.  I shudder to think of the damage done to innocent teens by  parents and teachers who took this book seriously.  If you can put that  disturbing thought aside, however, the book is hysterical in the sheer  absurdity of its misinformation.  I guess that makes Mr. Larson an evil  clown in the classic sense.	1999-12-12

In Immacolata, it also has  the single most inspiring 'bad guy' that this villain-groupie has ever come  across.  I cannot praise this book nearly enough - and yes, I have read  'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'.  There's no comparison.  One is an  overbearing children's allegory, the other is a subtle and marvelous  display of the full force of a very gifted imagination.	1999-12-12

This book is  packed with information that will help dispel the fear and misunderstanding  with which people view bats, but at the same time it is by no means too  technical to be readily understood (I first read it when I was about  fourteen iirc and enjoyed it as much then as I do now.)  I would recommend  this book to anyone anywhere who is the least bit interested in nature and  also to anyone who is fearful or concerned about bats in their  nieghborhood.	1998-10-09

I'm a writer myself and no slouch  when it comes to reading &quot;hard&quot; books, but I can't stand the  tricksy, overbearing attitude of the first few chapters (all I could bring  myself to read.)  It was as though Rice was thinking that every random  sensory impression that came into her head was of compelling interest.  I  suspect that Rice has become a victim of her own success; if you want to  see a more fair representation of what she is capable of, read _Interview  With the Vampire_ instead.	1998-09-13
