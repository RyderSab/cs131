Nicholson explores ground previously trod by such horror heavyweights as John Farris (The Fury) and John Saul (Shadows), but he brings his unique humor and humanity to the mix.  I highly recommend this novel to fans of Bentley Little and John Saul.	2005-09-27

New prison guard Tim Sagett becomes increasingly aware of the supernatural forces at work, but no one will believe him.    This is horror in the school of Bentley Little and Andrew Neiderman, anchored by strong characters but still able to go for graphic shocks and supernatural set-pieces.  I won't spoil any of the many creepy suprises in the book, but will say that if you like early Robert McCammon or Bentley Little you will definately enjoy THE PRISON.

The tiny town of Madelyn in the California desert is experiencing a rash of strange phenomenon: unexplained lights in the sky, people vanishing, farm animals mutilated. A millenialist cult leader claiming these are the end times has his followers waiting for the Four Horsemen from the Book of Revelations to make an appearence.  But none of this is exactly what you'd expect, Thorne plays on the various mythologies of UFO's, religious cults, and serial killers like a virtuoso conductor, thrilling the audience with plot twists, a fully fleshed out cast, and loads of action and violence. This epic horror novel is strongly recommended for fans of Robert McCammon or Stephen King.	2004-07-07

She packs a few belongings and heads out on the interstate to hitchhike.  Her third ride turns out to be a killer with a literal taste for blood.

Several captives are imprisoned in an underground vault and sexually tortured in bizarre ways. These are the two main plotlines in a twist and turn filled pulp horror novel from the late Richard Laymon. There are suprises around every corner, laughs and plenty of extreme gross-outs.  If you have never read Richard Laymon before this is a fine place to start, but beware: this is undiluted horror-black, no sugar, no cream, but plenty of blood, sex and torture.<br />Also recommended:  BLOOD ROAD by Edo Van Belkom, THE CHURCH OF DEAD GIRLS by Stephen Dobyns, and RISEN by J.

Only a few of the characters are fleshed out, but Van Belkom has a flair for description and action sequences.  I would recommend this novel to fans of Richard Laymon and Tamara Thorne.	2003-03-30

Most dog lovers understand that the plight of stray dogs is miserable.  Unfortunately, they feel the problem is unsolvable, so they simply push it to the back of their minds.  This book tells the inspirational story of one man who took it upon himself to help unwanted dogs.  Many of the stories in the book are heartbreaking and hopefully they will serve as a wake-up call for dog lovers everywhere.  Personally, I resolved to do fundraising for my local shelter after reading THE MAN WHO TALKS TO DOGS.  If every dog lover who reads the book decides to do something-anything! to help the cause of abused and abandoned animals then we can make a big improvement in the lives of man's best friend.	2002-12-31

The pair find fresh clever uses for such creepshow trappings as secret passageways, family madness, and diabolical mutilations.  I especially like the way the authors weave in so much research without slowing the pace of the story. One aspect reminded me of Thomas Harris's HANNIBAL, a meditation technique employed by one of the recurring characters.<br />Still, if you are looking for a fast paced, blood-curdling yarn, I don't think you will find a better one this summer.	2002-06-11

The main character, Bonnie Winter, is trapped between a lout of a husband and a business she runs cleaning up crime scenes. From the beginning she is a quirky, take it as it comes, female heroine, but we sense that she is bottling things up. Oh, boy!

I admit that I didn't do more than skim this book.  As a horror fan I couldn't get past the authors' factual error in stating that the early 1990's was a pinnacle of horror. WRONG! In terms of the number of horror films released the height would be the mid-1980's.  In terms of box office returns it would be the mid-1970's (The Exorcist, Jaws, The Omen, Carrie, Halloween).  We are now (2002) at a much higher peak for horror than the period that the Professor calls the pinnacle; the early 1990's was actually a nadir.	2002-02-09

As usual there is a deceptively simple premise:  A librarian begins playing a game with an unseen person who refers to himself as MOG. She gets increasing amounts of cash for figuring out riddles and going to where the next clue is hidden.  But the game gets increasingly sinister and she finds that MOG won't let her stop.  Creepy, violent, graphic, twisted, is what you should expect from Laymon, but I for one had a blast playing/reading this book. IN THE DARK is a great horror novel.	2001-10-12

The story follows the exploits of an evil bocor (sorcerer) who has a plan to gain influence the US President.  The sorcerer uses his powers to control the minds of others, including a little girls who he kidnaps and takes with him to Florida.  I enjoyed the creepier aspects of the novel but thought that some of the subplots were a drag, including a perfunctory romance.

But if you have a taste for cannibalism and gross-out pick this up. It suprises me the bad reviews that this book has recieved because it is too repulsive-the book is clearly explained on the cover. Do you also rent porn films and complain there is too much sex? Jonathan develops a fetish for eating human flesh and the author excels at the creepy connection to the Catholic rite of communion. As he develops into an adult cannibal killer he meets what may be a demon who wants Jonathan to worship him. The later portion of the book seems less thoroughly drawn than the beginning, but at least the author is able to take the reader to places that they have never been before. Lunchtime!	2001-08-24

Tamara Thorne is one of the few authors who can mix horror and humor without watering down either.  The focus of the plot is a mafia style war between two families of vampires.  There is also a dash of romance and quite a bit of sex, but don't worry-this is not a typical 'vampire romance', expect plently of gore and gothic atmosphere.  Highly recommended for fans of Laurell Hamilton.  A vampire novel with plenty of juice!	2001-07-31

Tarantula's, dart shooting plants, ancient turtles, and of course the enigmatic river dolphins are woven together into a fascinating read.

Not the classics like THE EXORCIST, more like the fun drive-in movies of the period:  PROPHECY, NIGHTWING, BEYOND THE DOOR.  It takes the subject matter seriously enough to be entertaining, unlike the self referential horror-comedies of today.<br />Owl Goingback writes smooth, simple prose that makes for a lightning fast read. He is at his finest with action scenes and visual description. The inner dialog of the characters, however, is often cliche ridden, but if you can get past that you'll have a great time.<br />The plot concerns a voodoo sorcerer whose spirt inhabits a small lagoon in Northern Florida.  In order to become resurrected he must possess a child. If you enjoy books by Graham Masterton, Richard Laymon, or John Saul then you'll enjoy taking this trip.	2001-06-04

If Hitchcock were alive today I'm sure he would be drawn to this dark, psychological thriller about a small town caught in a maelstrom of suspicion.

A true crime writer begins recieving strange notes which request that he leave items (a red ball, a pint of beer) in a giant rundown cemetery next door.  At first he resists but bad things start to happen, accidents, coincidences, and he finally gives in. But when you bargain with the Devil you always pay a price. This thriller is true to the classic formula of a small town which hides an ancient evil. The supernatural forces are glimpsed but never fully explained.

The vampires in this book are frightening, supernatural monsters; in other words this is not Anne Rice.  Ronald Kelly does a particularly good job here of evoking the culture of rural Tennessee, and also creates sympathetic, three dimensional characters to be menaced by the [vampires].

As in 'The Stake' the vampires play a rather minor role in the story.  This is really a novel about the bittersweet adventures of adolescence.  Laymon is able to capture the freedom and terror of being sixteen and keep the plot moving at a terrific speed.  A wild, crazy and zestfully depraved novel	2001-04-05

A group of strange religious wanderers are massacred by residents of a  farm community toward the end of the Civil War.  A tree is planted over the  mass grave and the dead stay quiet.  Over a century later the tree is  bulldozed down to make room for a mall and the dead rise up.  They are not  rotting zombies, but eerily beautiful looking creatures that want to blend  in with the community.  Their goal is to lure people to join a cult and  become immortal, soulless creatures like them.  <br />This novel takes cues  from INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and vampire stories, but creates its'  own monsters.  Jensen is best at evoking domestic suspense moments like  feeling watched through an open window or a stranger staring at you from  across the road. There are a few gruesome scenes and a general sense of  xenophobia that make this novel an uncanny read.  If you like your horror  leavened with humor Ruby Jean Jensen is not for you.
