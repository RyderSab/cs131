Books	5	13	13	N	N	The Monster Kid with the biggest heart	To my mind, there is no greater Monster Kid than Bob Burns. Burns has lived (and continues to!) the life that every Monster Kid dreams of. He has met some of the giants in the field; become friends with many other lesser-known, but equally interesting personalities; participated in the making of some of the classic films of the genre; appeared on television as part of Shock Theater; has accumulated an untold number of props and other memorabilia over his more than 50-year association with monster and science fiction films; and produced some of the most talked-about, elaborate, and awe-inspiring Halloween \\"haunted attraction\\" spectacles of all time. <br /> <br />Yet, despite his extreme good fortune, which could turn lesser men selfish and possessive, Bob Burns never hesitates to share his stories, anecdotes, collection, and super big heart with others. <br /> <br />At long last, Burns, in collaboration with horror/science fiction genre writer Tom Weaver, has gathered a collection of his wonderful experiences in Monster Kid Memories. Here, Burns shares many of the highlights of his life with fellow fans, in addition to hundreds of amazing, seldom-seen photos (the book contains over 300 illustrations), including one very special, never-before seen shot of the Martian costume from War Of The Worlds.  <br /> <br />Ever the selfless, generous Kid, Bob turns the spotlight on others, allowing them to shine. We: listen with envy as he describes seeing Bela Lugosi on stage and relates his encounters with Karloff, Elsa Lanchester, Chaney Jr., George Pal, and William Castle; visit the sets of films (Destination Moon, Unknown Island, the 2002 remake of The Time Machine); learn the intricacies of portraying a gorilla; discover the man behind the genius that was Jack Pierce; help Bob rig the seats for a showing of The Tingler; and learn of Bob's innumerous movie prop acquisitions over the decades (he owned the original Time Machine!) and how he came to possess them - these are just a handful of the many treats awaiting the reader. <br /> <br />The book contains numerous highlights, but a few deserve special mention:  <br /> <br />The chapter where Bob discusses his friendship with Glenn Strange (the man behind the Frankenstein monster in the Universal House films and Abbott And Costello Meet Frankenstein) is touching and sweet. The two men first met when Bob was a teen, but a genuine friendship started, and lasted until the day Strange died in 1973. The two men shared many experiences together, and such a bond developed, that Burns came to think of Strange as a second father. It's wonderful to read of a friendship between two men like this, and to have Strange step out of those huge Frankenstein monster boots (which Strange gave to Burns by the way, along with an unused Monster headpiece) and learn that he was just a down-to-earth, regular Joe. <br /> <br />A chapter detailing Bob's friendship with George Pal is illuminating. We learn that Pal was a warm and fun-loving man, in addition to fascinating facts about the making of Destination Moon, The Time Machine, and War Of The Worlds. Unfortunately, the chapter is also heart-breaking. To learn Bob's opinion of what really killed Pal is to want to storm the offices of today's Hollywood bigwigs with torches and pitchforks.  <br /> <br />The fact that Bob relates the lives and stories of many \\"behind-the-scenes\\" people - people whose names won't ring any bells and often don't receive any of the credit and recognition they deserve, is refreshing and very welcome. Some of the make-up artists, stuntmen, bit players, prop and special effects people that Burns knew receive their just due here, and I was grateful to learn of some of the \\"invisible\\" people behind some of my favorite old-time films and serials. <br /> <br />Lastly, the chapter that details the history of each of Bob's Halloween \\"haunted spectaculars\\" made this reader greener with envy than Elsa as the monster in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.Reading of the amount of time, effort, and talent that went into producing each of these shows, merely for the entertainment of friends and neighborhood children, is a testament to just how big Bob Burns's heart really is. <br /> <br />The mere fact that these memories, and much more, are captured in one book is reason enough to recommend it. But quite often the telling of one's life to another can make for a dull, difficult read. Not Monster Kid Memories. Although many of these memories occurred decades ago, you wouldn't know it to read it. When he's relating one of his many stories, there is such genuine excitement and enthusiasm emanating from Burns that you swear you're sitting in a chair across from him, listening, caught up in his excitement - several times while reading I found myself actually exclaiming, \\"Oh, wow!\\" <br /> <br />This sense of fun and \\"gee-whiz!\\" excitement, perfectly captured and transferred to the page by co-author Weaver, is the book's grand accomplishment. For several hours, the reader once again becomes a little 15-year-old boy (or girl!). Only a handful of books can accomplish magic like this, and Monster Kid Memories is one of them. <br /> <br />My only regret is the fear that the title might turn away a wider audience. While the book does concentrate primarily on Burns's association with monsters and science fiction, a potential reader should know that these stories will appeal to anyone. You don't have to love monsters and aliens - Bob Burns does, and the kid-like joy and genuine love that he has for his subjects spills over onto the page and will captivate any film fan.  <br /> <br />Just a terrific book.	2004-11-12

Having read it, I am majorly disappointed. The &quot;numerous direct quotes and stories from Elizabeth herself, as well as from family members...&quot; is a bit misleading. These quotes and stories are culled from interviews previously printed in old magazines, not interviews the author conducted herself.  <br />Most of the book covers Montgomery's life during and before Bewitched. Her career after the series is very glossed over.<br />I SUPPOSE since the subject is deceased and the author probably didn't have the cooperation of the family this is the best fans can hope for, but...having read innumerous interviews of Montgomery myself in old magazines over the years, I've seen a LOT of this already.                                               <br />Plus, there are numerous spelling typos and factual mistakes. In one case, in different parts of the book the year of the marriage between Montgomery and Foxworth is given as 1993 and 1994. And the name of one of Liz's TV movies is &quot;Between THE Darkness and THE Dawn&quot;, not &quot;Between Darkness and Dawn&quot;, as listed in the book. Among others. <br />The biggest grievance is the quality of the photographs. The author does initially point out that the quality of some are bad due to the poor quality of the negatives, but almost ALL the photographs look horrible! Even more recent photographs come out terrible.<br />I do have to give credit to the author for collecting and organizing tons of old Montgomery interviews into one location. And as this, to date, is the only bio of Montgomery that fans have, fans will have to settle for this...	2004-05-17
US	50011256	R3518TQHVOOF9	1879505673	608198299	John Carpenter: The Prince of Darkness	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Like Carpenter talking to you in your living room	In John Carpenter: The Prince of Darkness, French author and magazine publisher Gilles Boulenger conducts a lengthy (book-length, obviously!) interview with the man who has done more for the horror movie genre than any other director working today.<br />In the book, Carpenter touches on and discusses each of his films - from the student project Dark Star from 1970 to his most recent (at the time of this book) The Ghosts Of Mars - revealing his thoughts and memories on the inspiration, method, problems, filming, cast, box office, lessons learned from his successes and failures, and more.<br />We learn of such disparate topics as: his first initial directing efforts as a child; being inspired by German expressionism; the inspiration drawn from Howard Hawks movies and how many of Carpenter's films are simply westerns in disguise; his early obsession and present-day compulsion to make films; and even trying to write a movie for Barbara Streisand (sort of!); <br />It is a wonderful, in-depth look into the mind of a modern-day director. Particularly interesting is seeing, through Carpenter's own words, his growth in maturity as a director, both in his craft and, sadly, learning how the &quot;studio system&quot; really works--executives who don't know what they're doing making decisions that usually worked to the disadvantage of the film.<br />Through the book we read, fascinated, as Carpenter's career comes to resemble a roller coaster - we read as the director's films slowly rise in terms of success, accolades, and budget, culminating in a huge hit or peak - invariably followed by a huge failure, sending Carpenter plummeting back down the ride that is a career as a film director, resulting in him basically having to start over from scratch.<br />Author Boulenger is an intelligent and insightful interviewer. He seems to know every minute detail about Carpenter's movies and often brings to the table telling insights and interpretations that even Carpenter hadn't thought of, but readily agrees to.<br />The book is generously illustrated with photographs and some sketches, including a handsome 24-page collection of color photos. <br />Only a few minor problems for me with the book: while each of Carpenter's films are touched on and discussed, some are not &quot;...thoroughly...&quot; discussed as the book's back cover offers. While one can argue their quality or importance, some films, such as Body Bags and Elvis: The Movie--among others--are allotted just one or two pages. <br />Also, while the behind-the-scenes photos in the book are interesting and fun to have, many of the production photos reproduced here are very common and have been seen many times before. More unique, less often-seen photos would have been nice.<br />But those two minor quibbles cannot begin to take away from the greater achievement of the book - a fascinating, thoughtful, career-spanning, one-on-one personal conversation with the man who's made some of the most important and interesting horror movies in the past few decades. <br />Highly recommended.	2003-12-08

Skal has picked a handful of topics to which he has collected a score of personal anecdotes and stories from people across the country, with occasional interjections of analysis thrown in.<br />On the plus side, the personal anecdotes are interesting and fun; photos showing early 20th century Halloween-themed postcards are delightful; and one chapter, which (among other things) details the gay community's association with the holiday is fascinating.<br />However, these positives are outweighed by several problems.<br />A sense of \\"been there, done that\\", permeates much of the book. While the inclusion of certain subjects in any history of Halloween is almost mandatory - guaranteeing a certain repetition of information - the fact remains that some will have already read much of what is included here. <br />A chapter entitled Halloween On Screen spends more time detailing the storylines of the (Michael Myers) HALLOWEEN movies than trying to find some underlying themes or connections between Halloween-related films and the holiday itself.<BR>  <BR>Lastly, I lost faith in the book's factual accuracy. In one paragraph, mention is made of a particular film. The first thing to catch my attention was an incorrect year attached to the movie. Second, a questionable statement is made concerning the fate of the young female student.  Depending on one's interpretation of this statement, this statement is also incorrect. That two errors are found back-to-back just made me question what else in the book might be inaccurate. <br />All considered, I do not recommend DEATH MAKES A HOLIDAY. In addition to the above problems (and others not mentioned), when one considers the book comes in at under 200 pages (when index and notes are subtracted), the price tag is high for the product delivered. And when you start doubting a book's facts...	2002-10-28

No one is &quot;on&quot;, no one tries to be funny, everyone just opens their hearts and reveal what they truly feel. I have a (new) huge amount of respect now for Bill Murray who I never thought could take ANYthing seriously - here he is incredibly serious, fortright, and reflective.

Genre interviewer extraordinaire, Tom Weaver, is back with his first book since the celebrated John Carradine: The Films. I Was A Monster Movie Maker collects 22 interviews with various genre personalities, the majority of whom may not immediately ring bells with even the most knowledgeable of genre fans. All of these interviews have appeared in abridged versions in various magazines; here they are printed in their entirety.<br />The range of interviewees range from the easily recognizable: Maureen O'Sullivan, Norman Lloyd, Phyllis Kirk, Dana Wynter, and John Kerr--to the downright scratch-your-head-and-ask-who? variety: Booth Colman (Dr. Zaius on the Planet Of The Apes television series, Karloff's Thriller), Nelson Gidding (screenwriter of The Haunting), Suzanna Leigh (The Deadly Bees, Lust For A Vampire), and Joan Weldon (Them!), among others. Filmographies are included for all performers.<br />Among the many treats to be found: O'Sullivan's days as Tarzan's Jane and the revelation of whether there was any romance with Johnny Weissmuller; Wynter's discussions on the 1956 Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, and Kevin McCarthy; Candace Hilligoss' very frank opinions concerning the Carnival Of Souls remake; the always interesting Norman Lloyd's remembrances, especially those of Hitchcock; Phil (Uncle Owen) Brown's recollections of his getting his role in Star Wars, meeting George Lucas, and anecdotes of Lon Chaney, Jr.; Paul Picerni and Phyllis Kirk (in what are clearly the best of interviews done with these two stars) share trips down memory lane, relating tales of making House Of Wax (Picerni's story of filming the guillotine scene is priceless), Andre' de Toth, and Vincent Price; Nelson Gidding's discussion on bringing The Haunting (original version) to the screen; and Ray (My Favorite Martian) Walston talks of working with Lugosi.<br />In too many interviews, the reader only gets a rapid-fire question and answer session, with no sense of any real interest being generated by either party. Weaver's strength, however, is his ability to get his subjects to really open up. The reader feels that there is a real conversation between two interested parties going on, rather than a rote asking/answering of questions. Perhaps it's his genuine interest in his subjects; perhaps it's his years of experience; perhaps it's his research and preparedness (he often knows more about his subjects' careers than the subjects themselves can remember!). Regardless of Weaver's secret, we get a depth, interest, and even excitement out of the subjects--not to mention the wealth of memories and anecdotes--that one seldom finds elsewhere. <br />Downsides to the book? I could find only two, and they are small, one (perhaps both) out of the hands of the author. First, that cover!  Second, my usual complaint with books by McFarland: the price. Like all McFarland books, IWAMMM is nicely produced and certainly worth the price, but still more than likely out of the price range of many of the monster fans the book is written for.<br />I Was A Monster Movie Maker is typical first-rate, high quality product readers have come to expect from the author, and is the latest in a long line of his acclaimed interview books.	2002-06-07
US	50011256	R5S6GG482QM11	0595207243	536972928	New Traditions in Terror	Books	4	3	3	N	N	The genre's alive and well	New Traditions In Terror is a new and ambitious horror fiction anthology. Why ambitious? Because the whole of the book is comprised of stories dealing with subject matter already much overdone: we're talking vampires, werewolves, vengeful spirits, ghouls, demons, and evil people here. A risky proposition indeed, as nowadays I dread reading vampire or werewolf stories for knowing that while the characters may change, the basic storyline is one that I've read hundreds of times before. That in itself would be acceptable, if not compounded by the fact that I usually also will have gotten absolutely nothing out of the story by its conclusion: no emotion, no involvement with any of the characters, not even the consolation of knowing that while nothing new may have been brought to the table, at least I'd had the pleasure of reading a gripping, page-turning story.<br />And so, New Traditions In Terror delivers sixteen stories and one poem, by authors the readers of Horror-Wood may not be familiar with. Seventeen fresh voices accepting the daunting challenge of writing tales containing characters that are increasingly looked down upon in the field as being passé.<br />For the most part, the authors vindicate themselves extremely well. While admittedly, few stories really do break any new ground (a story concerning a cyber werewolf is a notable exception), as a whole the stories are well-written, and do manage to sweep the reader up and carry them along for a short, but enjoyable ride. Many evoke a well-defined and appropriate atmosphere, almost tangible, as well as creating developed characters that I came to care about, hoping they would come to a good - or deservingly bad - end. On at least one occasion I compared a story (favorably) to some classics I fondly remember from my decades of reading.<br />A few stories in this collection deserve mention. \\"Afraid Of The Water\\", by Robynn Clairday, does such a good job of evoking concrete images in her tale, that it brought backsome very unpleasant memories of my own fear of water as a young child. \\"Monster\\", by Peter N. Dudar, is a great example of a tale that can build suspense and keep a reader on edge through merely hinting at the horror, rather than through any blatant or graphic depiction of it. A wonderful example of \\"less is more.\\" The ending has a wonderful, Lovecraftian/Cthulhu feel to it. Lastly, there is \\"Kiowa Wells\\", by R. A. Cox. The highlight of the book, Cox's tale takes an old idea (vengeful Indian spirit), and weaves it into an enthralling classic. Heavily atmospheric, well-developed and written, perfect pacing, ever-increasing chills. I predict a deserved, enduring popularity for this one.<br />The only aspect of the book that I feel doesn't work is one story, only because it reads more like a \\"The Shadow\\"-type detective tale, with a monster casually thrown in at the end because one was needed, than as a horror story. It's a good tale, mind you, but definitely feels out of place with respect to the rest of the collection.<br />That said, New Traditions In Terror is a fine read, and a welcome addition to a horror fiction library. A collection of well-crafted and entertaining tales, from 17 talented writers from whom I hope we'll be fortunate enough to hear from again. It's encouraging to know that the future of horror fiction is in such capable hands.	2002-06-07
US	50011256	RTQZQEKG04ESM	0759637474	758671591	Halloween Candy	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Full of goodies	Halloween Candy is like a candy container after an evening of trick-or-treating. It's chock full of a variety of goodies, of varying sizes, shapes, and flavors. You name it, Halloween Candy has it: several short (short!) stories, numerous essays, an interview, a review, and a screenplay. <br />Treats include: a dead-on assessment of the current, sad state of the Saturn Awards (with disagreement with the author in only one minor respect: he believes them to be of more importance and influence than does this reviewer); an interview with Jonathan &quot;Barnabas Collins&quot; Frid, from 1986--previously published in an abridged version, here in its entirety; an essay which explores the use of actors as villains in horror films ; a comparison/contrast of the TV series The Night Stalker and The X-Files, and the inspiration of the former on the latter; an essay which tries to define that ever-elusive genre called &quot;horror&quot;; and the previously-mentioned screenplay.<br />Some elaboration: the interview with Frid, although dated, is interesting. Frid has never had much interest in discussing horror movies or vampires, so hearing his remembrances of Dark Shadows and Barnabas are much fun, as is learning how the actor has kept himself busy since the series folded. Also, the essay defining the horror genre, while a bit lengthy, is informative, well presented, and certain to inspire many heartfelt debates.<br />But the screenplay is the heart of the book. Halloween Candy (screenplay) is an anthology, relating the fates of four children after they get on the bad side of a witch. Optioned several times, and once almost directed by Tom Savini, I'm perplexed by the fact that it still sits unproduced (the screenplay's lengthy history is detailed in the book's introduction). It is very good, and would certainly make a better movie than some of the fare that somehow does make it to the big screen today.<br />There are two aspects to the book, however, that I feel are small missteps. One, a review with a title of Haunted Houses In California, actually reviews only a handful. Published in 1997, the information is more than likely dated, and the reader would have to either live in California, or have the means to visit, for the information to be of real value. Second, duplication of material, as one of the longer short stories is a novelization of one of the stories contained in the screenplay. <br />The above two quibbles, however, are decidedly small and in no way take away from the overall enjoyment of the book. <br />Halloween Candy, with its mixed bag of contents, has something for everyone. Dig in your hand and you're sure to pull out a treat.	2002-01-28

The book is suspenseful, and contains well-written characters that you come to care about. I read this book in a matter of days, as I couldn't resist the temptation to keep reading to find out how certain situations were going to be resolved. A nice surprise for me was the ending. I expected the ending to go the typical route, and Clark pulled the rug out from under me by going in a completely unexpected direction.<BR> <BR>The reason I don't give this book five stars...and it was very close...is for two slight disappointments for me. Despite what I wrote earlier, there two characters who have little, if any depth, and border on being clichés. One, the \\"bad guy\\", is written as being so blatantly \\"evil\\", that he borders on being cartoonish (his fate at book's end is also a disappointment). His totally oblivious and mousy wife is the other. Second, I'm disappointed that Clark falls to using an overused cliché of the horror genre: The protagonist who, despite every instinct and amount of danger, refuses to tell the spouse what's going on. And here, in this book, doesn't for little more reason than \\"not wanting to burden her.\\" <br />But those two quibbles are minor and only slightly took away from the book for me. Horror fans shouldn't pass this one up.	2001-11-13

It is suspenseful, engrossing, and well-written. The characters are, for the most part, fleshed-out and believable. The best compliment and review I can give this book is to say that the other night I stayed up until 3 in the morning to read 250+ pages because I HAD to know how it ended. It's that good.<BR> <BR>It's not without some minor flaws, however. I thought the ending was just a little TOO perfect and tidy, but I can't elaborate more without giving away plot. Also,I admit I'm not a book editor, but even so I found it extremely difficult to believe that any editor would become so gung-ho and go to the lengths that Maris did, based solely on the first few pages of a book.<BR> <BR>But, those minor quibbles can not take away from the quality of the story and the writing. Thus, I cannot give the book anything less than 5 stars.	2001-11-05
US	50011256	R2UZP15GIO8HZ6	0595161413	250424992	Blood and Popcorn	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good fun	Pagonis' first novel centers on the exploits of a character known as P-Man. P-Man is in his mid-twenties, lives with his ever-supportive mother, loves rock and roll and horror films, and works at a bookstore in a shopping mall in a suburb of Washington DC. P-Man has a host of rather unique friends, and the desert that is his dating experience comes to an abrupt halt when he lands up dating Tina, one of the sexiest girls working at the mall.<br />The core of the action of the story centers on the efforts of P-Man, along with Tina and his friends, to host a horror/cult movie marathon at the mall's theaters and their plans to entice TV horror host, Count Gore DeVol to be their special guest. <br />The book is fun, quite humorous, and has much to recommend it. The characters are colorful and interesting. I must say it's nice for a change to read of a mother/son relationship where they actually care for each other and aren't at each other's throats. And although I must admit that at first I had a hard time swallowing the premise that a girl like Tina would fall for a guy like P-Man, after accepting it, I found their relationship to be very nicely handled - not your typical angst-ridden coupling here. <br />Lastly, the book is a great throwback for anyone who grew up in the 80s, especially if you held a job in a &quot;strip&quot; mall. Pagonis nicely captures the essence of what is was/is like being a &quot;mallrat&quot; and the sub-culture that goes with it. <br />Blood and Popcorn is a fast, easy, enjoyable read. I highly recommend it.	2001-10-24

Brite, Charles L. Grant, Peter Straub, Dean Koontz, Ramsey Campbell, Ray Bradbury, the late Richard Laymon and many, many others. Many of the authors also contribute short reflection pieces, detailing their favorite Halloween memories. Lastly, several essays explore such aspects of the holiday as its history, Halloween in literature, and a detailed look at &quot;Halloween&quot;-related movies.<br />I won't go into a &quot;this story is great, that story sucked&quot; litany, as such things are subjective. I can, however, say that the overall quality of the stories is very good. I found several to be flat-out excellent. Perhaps one of the best compliments one can pay this anthology is that I will be pursuing other works of many of the authors within this collection that I've heretofore been unfamiliar with, as a result of the impressiveness of their stories here.<br />The authors' Halloween remembrances run the gamut of emotions: from humorous to scary, nostalgic, and sorrowful. In perhaps the saddest memory, Halloween for Ray Bradbury will never again be the same.<br />Lastly, there are the essays. One, covering the history of Halloween, is entertaining and informative. Even the most knowledgeable Halloween expert may learn something new here. A well-researched piece covering Halloween fiction nicely scratches the surface of a topic that definitely needs many more pages. Lastly, an overview of Halloween films is one of those fun lists in which you're sure to disagree with the author at some point, hollering out: &quot;How could he have left out: (fill in the blank)?&quot; <br />Theonly noticeable misstep for the book, in my opinion, is the exclusion of any of the Halloween-themed tales from one of the undisputed masters, Robert Bloch.<br />Don't be scared off by this book's price tag. Considering the incredible lineup of genre authors included here, the quality of the work, and the fact that the book comes in at over 660+ pages, the book is a bargain. Don't pass this one up.	2001-10-24

If you have even the minutest of interest in the classic horror genre, then you can’t help but know of the feud that exists between former Famous Monsters editor Forrest Ackerman, and current publisher and editor Ray Ferry. No other issue in the history of horror fandom has ever approached the level of interest, passion, or outright nastiness as this one. Since Ackerman’s resignation as editor in the mid-90s, through the subsequent trial brought on by Ackerman’s lawsuit against Ferry, Ferry has remained quiet, while Ackerman has not. Until now.<br /><br />In Life Is But A Scream, Ferry presents his side of the story. The book details the history of Ferry’s relationship with Forry, from the first meeting through trial’s end. In between we learn the history of many events that (usually) involved the two of them through the 90s: the making of the HORRAY FOR HORRORWOOD and AMAZING WORLDS OF SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY videos, the ’93 and ’95 FM conventions, Ferry’s first meetings with various horror genre celebrities, behind-the-scenes looks into the making of each issue of FM from #200 on (including wonderful stories about the colorful celebrities involved), and of course, the deterioration of their relationship and subsequent trial.<br /><br />The book is a great read. Perhaps partially because Ferry’s recounting of stories are events that I took part in (I attended both conventions), which brought back many a fond memory, and admittedly, partially because I was anxious to get to the details of the trial itself, I finished the 400+ page book in only three days. But my impatience in getting to the trial does not take away from what comes before. Ferry’s remembrances are interesting, in particular ones which detail Ferry’s trip to London, and his first meetings with Ray Harryhausen and Ray Bradbury, among others. And it is absolutely fascinating to receive such a detailed history of what it took to revive FM and keep it going, especially the many obstacles Ferry encountered and how/what he did to overcome them.<br /><br />Although he does throw in occasional jabs early on concerning Forry’s ego and later does not hesitate to “tell it like it is” concerning Ackerman and others, I feel Ferry shows incredible restraint in presenting his side of the story. If you believe the story he presents (and my phrasing that as I do does not necessarily mean that I do not), then it is incredible that he did not use the entire 400+ pages at his disposal to lambaste Ackerman and his devotees. The circulated “fact” one hears that Ferry spends the entire book tearing down Forry is just myth. The tone is not that of an attempt to deliberately “tear down” Ackerman, but simply the presentation of numerous, sad facts in an attempt to defend oneself after many years of silence. Also, Ferry spends an ample amount of time not discussing Ackerman at all, instead relating stories concerning the current friends of FM (both celebrity and non) and expressing repeated thanks at their help and support.<br /><br />There are two points that do detract from the book, however. The excessive number of typos and grammatical errors throughout are simply incredible (and inexcusable). Also, although it does come in at over 400 pages, I feel the price is a bit steep, particularly for a paperback (and for many a monster fan’s budget). While readers could dismiss much of the evidence Ferry presents as just “made up”, they would be doing a great disservice and show themselves to be deliberately close-minded to dismiss the sworn testimony related from the trial. The testimony of all parties, particularly of Ackerman himself, is very, very revealing. However, many monster fans already have their minds made up concerning the two involved parties. Will ANY member of horror fandom be willing to open their minds, take off their rose-colored glasses, read this book and try to be objective about the Forry/Ferry issue, and even possibly have long-held beliefs challenged? Unlikely. Fans of Ackerman will have nothing to do with the book, yet love to spout about how injustly &#34;inaccurate&#34; it is and write mean-spirited &#34;reviews&#34; of it.<br /><br />Monster fans would do well to remember that in a breakup, no one party is ever completely guilty and the other completely innocent.	2001-07-10
US	50011256	R1KTSLBGJLFAFB	1887664033	679797920	Guilty Pleasures of the Horror Film	Books	3	3	3	N	N	A guilty pleasure of a book.	This book's purpose, as stated in its Introduction: &quot;...the writer has to share internal struggles, sometimes embarrassing predilections...in order to define the merits of a piece of moviemaking which most people have either forgotten or else dismiss as utter trash. Thus, writing about one's cinematic guilty pleasure takes intricate self-analysis heaped upon piles of courage.&quot;<br />In this book, Midnight Marquee Press presents fourteen &quot;guilty&quot; films, with evidence presented in their favor, by MMP's roster of talented writers.<br />The writers certainly are daring. Who would have guessed that anyone would (or could) defend 1976's King Kong? Or Chaney Jr.'s Indestructible Man and Lugosi's Voodoo Man? Not this reviewer. But they do, among others, and admirably.                            <br />Most entries are well written, interesting, and informative. Given that, it brings me to a problem I have with the book: There is no one common style to the chapters. In some, we are given little more than lengthy synopses. (A warning to those who haven't seen some of the films discussed within: endings are revealed.) Others give a production history or a behind-the-scenes look into the making of the author's guilty pleasure (the chapter on When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth, is a lengthy, but fascinating example). Still others start out focused on the film at hand, and then go off-point. The chapter on Scared Stiff gives us more a history of the teaming of Jerry Lewis/Dean Martin than it discusses the titled film.<br />Individually, one admires each author's work. Put together, however, the book's disparate style causes a lack of cohesiveness that I feel is to the book's detriment. Each chapter has a definite feel of &quot;sticking out&quot;, of being an individual/independent unit, rather than meshing seamlessly, one into another. But perhaps that is an somewhat unfair criticism, for I certainly recognize that creativity demands that authors not have to followa rigid formula. Still...<br />Additionally, a disappointment of the book for me is the fact that while most authors do present compelling evidence in favor of their chosen film, many do so in an objective &quot;here's a reason why the film is good&quot; kind of way. Missing are the more subjective reasons, the personal anecdotes and &quot;...intricate self-analysis heaped upon piles of courage.&quot; that I was looking for. The fun spirit of the book's Introduction (especially the snippet quoted above) is either sadly missing, or given short shrift in many of the chapters. One wishes for more reminiscences and less plot summaries. <br />Given those complaints, this is still a very fun book. It allowed this reader to recapture some wonderful memories of watching and enjoying films not seen in many a day, despite their many and very obvious faults.  In the end, the book is recommended, for the pleasure derived (and the knowledge gained) from reading it far outweighs the above-mentioned quibbles	2001-06-30

It's hard to believe that for the first time a book provides not only COMPLETE coverage of each of his feature films, but also a wonderful 50+ page biography of the man we loved to have scare us. <br />In each of the feature film summaries, author Lucy Chase Williams not only gives us complete cast and credit listings, but also charming ancedotes provided by fellow cast members. This distinguished list includes Charlton Heston, Angela Lansbury, Jane Russell, Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck, and many, many others. <br />But what really makes this book a joy for all Vincent fans is the biography. Almost everyone only thinks of Vincent Price as &quot;that horror film actor&quot;, but he was so much more than that. Williams warmly reveals Price as the well-known, well-schooled, down-to-earth human being his fans knew him to be. We see the art lover, the fine cook, the author, the &quot;special guest star&quot; on HUNDREDS of television series, and... the practical joker who knew how to enjoy life and have fun. <br />The Complete Films of Vincent Price is a wonderful book. More appropriately, it is The COMPLETE Vincent Price. The multi-faceted gentleman everyone should get to know.	2001-05-31

Elizabeth Miller's latest book is a welcome relief for people like myself who are continually annoyed by the unsubstantiated theories and just plain incorrect facts that have (and continue to be) passed off and have become generally accepted as &quot;facts&quot; over the years. In Dracula: Sense And Nonsense, Miller (to use her own words) &quot;...challenges dozens of errors and misconceptions about Bram Stoker and his famous novel...&quot;<br />The book is divided into five main chapters which cover: the sources for the novel, Stoker's writing of his classic, the novel itself, the geography covered in the book and Vlad the Impaler. A sixth chapter covers the strengths and weaknesses of other (non-fiction) books that deal with the novel Dracula in some form (bios of Stoker, studies of the novel, etc.) Each chapter is also extensively annotated.<br />In each of the first five chapters, Miller quotes an error or misconception surrounding the chapter subject, gives the source for the quote and then presents her evidence as to why the quote is &quot;poppycock&quot; (one of my favorite expressions used in the book).<br />Ms. Miller sprinkles some welcome humor into the book with her initial reaction(s) against given quotes. Also, you can tell that every explanation was carefully and thoroughly researched. One comes away with an immense respect for the time, effort and thought that she put into presenting her case. Her writing is succinct and scholarly, although never written above the heads of her readers.<br />To truly appreciate the importance of this book, a little explanation is in order. Bram Stoker kept an incredibly comprehensive record concerning the origins and sources for the writing of Dracula, many times known as his &quot;working notes and papers&quot;. These notes were discovered in the Seventies. Thus, to establish any true facts concerning the novel, one need only look at the novel itself and Stoker's notes. Any information or &quot;facts&quot; that do/did not make use of these notes (since their discovery), can truly only be considered theories or assumptions.<br />In debunking the myths and errors related in her book, Miller uses Stoker's notes as her evidence. If the proof for one of the quoted &quot;facts&quot; cannot be found within said notes, Miller (correctly) identifies it hearsay, improbable, misinformed, or just plain incorrect. <br />Of the many inaccuracies Miller corrects, perhaps no other will cause more controversy than her severing the ties between the fictional Count and the real-life Vlad Tepes. According to the author, Stoker merely borrowed the name Dracula and any statement of fact that Stoker based his vampire Count (or even had much knowledge) on the bloodthirsty Vlad is irresponsible. Many more deep-seated, but less shocking assumptions and beliefs will likely be shattered by this book.<br />This won't be an easy book for many devoted fans of the novel. Old established beliefs can be hard to shake and many may simply dig in their feet and refuse to accept Miller's rebuttals. But serious fans of the novel owe it to themselves to give this book a reading. Miller only presents the best possible evidence: what Stoker himself wrote concerning the origins of his book. If it isn't in the notes, where's the proof?	2001-05-30

To put it simply, if you LOVE the film, ALL ABOUT EVE, you are going to love this book. If you're not gaga over the film, then this book has much more than you'll probably be interested in.   Some chapters are what I bought the book for: true insight into the making of one of my favorite films. The history of the short story from which the film is based, and the chapter covering the creation of the stage version, APPLAUSE, are fascinating.   The remainder of the book, however, contains much camp and personal opinion, more than fact. A different cup of tea for each individual reader.    A mixed bag of style and content, but still a fun and worthwhile read. Bold, brassy and gossipy, written much in the style of the film it covers.	2001-05-20

Janet Leigh provides a detailed,  behind-the-scenes look at almost all the aspects of the filming of  Hitchcock's masterpiece.  She provides stories and anecodotes as well as  remembrances of others connected with the picture, including rare words  from John Gavin.   It's written in a memoir style, with Ms. Leigh  discussing aspects as they occur to her, which is refreshing.  Importantly,  she also sets straight many of the rumors and misinformation surrounding  this movie over the years (DID Hitchcock or someone else film the famous  shower scene)?   A wonderful book on the making of a classic.  You'll enjoy  it if you're a huge fan of the movie, Ms. Leigh, Hitchcock or just  filmmaking in general.   My only complaint of the book is the fact that it  weighs in at under 200+ pages, thus I felt the price was a little on the  high side.  Well worth the price in the end, however.	2000-09-07

Dracula?).  In John Carradine: The Films, author Tom Weaver deftly documents each and every film of the multi-talented actor.  Complete cast and credits listings, synopsis and author commentarty for each film are included, as are remembrances from various co-stars, directors, Carradine's sons and even Carradine himself.  <br /> Weaver's commentaries on the films spices up the usual dryness found in many &quot;Films Of&quot; books, due to their rather strict cast/crew/summary formula.  An opinionated reviewer/critic, Weaver doesn't pull his punches in offering up his takes on Carradine's films.  Whether or not you agree with his views, it's nice to hear definite opinions for a change in a book like this, instead of the oft-times &quot;take-no-controversial-stand&quot; approach which, while certainly objective, doesn't always make for the most fascinating or interesting reading.  <br /> And for regular readers of the author, not to fear...the classic puns are here in good abundance, and will not fail to make one groan and shake one's head on occasion. <br /> Rounding out this tribute to the &quot;thin&quot; Dracula are recollections of Carradine from directors Joe Dante and Fred Olen Ray, and a mini-biography by Gregory Mank.  Carradine's flamboyance, lust for life, and love of Shakespeare, as well as his regrets and resignation to the many poor roles he either chose or was forced to accept in order to &quot;feed the family&quot; are just a few of the many sides to the actor that are captured by Mank.  <br /> In all, Tom Weaver has assembled an extraordinarily fine and fitting tribute to a too-long overlooked personage of classic horror history.  Par for the course for the author, John Carradine: The Films is thoroughly researched, hugely informative, frequently amusing, and mostimportantly: simply a must-have book.	2000-08-01

It compares VERY favorably with Anne Rice's series of books.  A fresh twist is put on a very old idea, and the characters are fleshed-out,  interesting and even amusing. It is rare for me to care about characters in  horror fiction because they are usually no more than cardboard cut-outs.  But you will come to care about Arthur, Jennings, Terry, Raymond and Iago,  as I did.  This book was so absorbing that I didn't want to stop reading or  for the story to end.   <br />The only thing keeping me from giving this book  5 stars was what I thought an excessive amount of repeated text in the  cross-relating stories of the main characters.  That, and the fact that I  thought that for a 700-year old vampire, Arthur was a bit too naive and  trusting about many things, especially human and vampire nature.   But  those are small quibbles.  I highly recommend this book to any lover of  vampire...or well-written, regardless of subject matter...fiction.	2000-07-21

The ending of every chapter leaves you hanging as to what's going to happen next.  It's a pretty good book.  It  definitely kept me turning the pages.   <br />                               SPOILER WARNING!    The downfall of the book for me was that fairly early  on one knows what's going to happen.  The bad or unsavory characters are  going to die, the good ones are going to live and the alien breaking the  rules will either die or be punished.  The speed with which one of the  heroes, Gill, came to understand and then be able to manipulate the alien  technology against the alien himself was a bit hard to swallow.  As was the  &quot;bad&quot; alien's superiors coming to apologize to the humans!  Also,  can we have ONE book that contains a superior race who, whether directly or  indirectly, does NOT moralize to the reader about how we humans have  treated both ourselves and our planet so badly?  Enough already.  This  &quot;message&quot; is as old as the hills.                                 <br />Despite those quibbles though, House of Doors was a light,  unchallenging, but enjoyable read.  It has definitely made me want to  explore other books by Mr. Lumley.	2000-07-17

To include excessive character conversation in one's synopsis  for an episode is a bit much.  Being long on summation tries to hide a lack  of truly interesting background or history of any particular episode. We  get more background information on other films and TV series that an  episode's actor appeared in than we do interesting anecdotes about the  particular episode from said actor(s).  My biggest complaint of the book  is the author's analysis (or lack of) of the performances in each episode.  It feels that little effort went into trying to truly analyze, understand,  or rate a performance.  The author falls into an easy habit of merely  throwing out simple (most times unexplained) adjectives:  &quot;very  good&quot;, &quot;capable&quot;, &quot;above average&quot;, &quot;below  average&quot;, or my favorite, &quot;adequate&quot;. The author uses the  term &quot;adequate&quot; over 150 times (and there were only 60+  episodes!).  I was almost pulling my hair out upon every subsequent  encounter of this word.  Another major fault is the lack of  photographs.  The number of photos can basically be counted on one hand.  This is a major loss.  Also, when presented with a book of nearly 200 pages  that is nearly all text, makes for very difficult reading.<br />  THIS IS A  THRILLER was a commendable idea for a book on a deserving TV series that  ends up being...just adequate.	2000-07-08

If it wasn't for some curse I have that I MUST finish a book that I start, I would have given up on this book within the first 100 pages.                                                                                          As stated by many other reviews, nothing happens in this book.  No action,  no suspense and the ending is a ludicrously-contrived, hurriedly thrown in  mix of The Exorcist and Poltergeist.                                              <br />  I don't need blood and gore to be happy with a novel of the  supernatural.  THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE by Shirley Jackson is one of my  favorite novels, one reason being that it shows that you CAN grab your  reader and terrify them with a &quot;less-is-more&quot; approach, with no  gory beheadings or buckets of blood necessary.                                                                      INCUBUS, however, is no HILL HOUSE.   One has to wait until exactly half way into the book before the first  mention of demons or an incubus is made.  Before that, the only action that  occurs is three women having erotic dreams and six school girls going a  little bit beyond that.  That's it.       The characters are forgettable  and we care about none of them.  The narrator's (Cora) sister Hannah, is a  self-centered, selfish snob.  The mother, besides being unnecessary to the  plot, is a martyr mother...she loves Hannah no matter how spiteful or  inconsiderate Hannah might be to her.  Our hero(?) Cora, is a disbelieving,  spineless preacher's wife who won't even speak up for herself when her  husband and friends practically make her a prisoner in her own home.                                                  <br />  The author's endless  insistence with detail concerning plants or food is infuriating.  If the  author had spent more time writing about the supernatural elements that  this book demands than telling us what Cora planted, how she cares for  plants, what she's cooked or planning to cook at any hour of the day or  night, and the list of ingredients for the dishes that she's  made/making....we'd have had a much better book.                                               <br />     I'm usually not this cruel with a review, but  this book was so boring to me....I couldn't WAIT until I could be done with  it.  I really do feel that I've wasted a few days of my life.	2000-07-05

If you're looking for a light, fluffy novel that will keep you turning the pages, then this is for you.   There's good but more bad to be found here.   I'll just list the points of each:                        <br />   GOOD:  it's  nice to see the monsters treated seriously.  Gone is the buffoonery  treatment to be found in the A&amp;C Meet Frankenstein movie (of which this  novel picks up the action after).  The monsters kill, and graphically. The  mood is often nicely menacing.  And, the book did keep me turning the  pages, it was absorbing.  I read this book in two days.                                  BAD:  the characterization is almost non-existent.  Characters  are developed with the broadest of strokes:  Wolfman, sympathetic.   Dracula, totally evil.  Etc.  I found the writing to be a bit stilted. The  author's annoying insistance of name-dropping names of characters or actors  from classic horror-land of yesteryear. A cute idea overdone.  Also  annoying is the need to have Dracula's minions mutter &quot;Yes,  master.&quot; over and over.   This is the only point(s) where the serious  tone of the book dissolves to remind me of the A&amp;C movie (not a good  thing).  Couldn't Dracula's slaves just silently obey commands?  Lastly,  the utter predictability of the action, especially the (overly maudlin)  ending.   No surprises here.       <br />    Overall, a great idea executed  fairly well.	2000-06-27

Blake's second book on Lon Chaney, A Thousand Faces: Lon Chaney's Unique Artistry in Motion Pictures, is a worthy and much-welcome companion volume to the author's first book:  Lon Chaney: The Man Behind  The Thousand Faces.         This book serves a two-fold purpose: First,  Blake reveals a lot of new information he uncovered about the actor's life  and films since his first book.  Second, this time around biography takes a  backseat to a detailed look at the films themselves (although there is  still plenty to be learned of Chaney's life).   <br />   Being THE  acknowledged Chaney authority and having acted himself at an early age,  Blake is able to provide a knowledgeable and well-balanced  analysis/commentary of Chaney's films (at least those that are not  &quot;lost&quot;).  While certainly the biggest fan of Lon Chaney, Blake  maintains the needed objectively to fairly critique each film and  performance.   As with his first book, a big highlight here is the wealth  of rare photos presented (including Lon both in and out of make-up), as is  the always fascinating information on how Chaney, a make-up master, created  those amazing characters.                       Blake is to be lauded for  his vast efforts in keeping alive the legacy of one of the greatest talents  of the silent era.  Thanks to author Blake, all the many fans of Lon Chaney  can be assured that Chaney's many talents and contributions to the world of  film (and film make-up!) will never be forgotten.	2000-06-22

The life of this amazing, multi-talented individual  is finally revealed to us with Lon Chaney:  The Man Behind The Thousand  Faces.               Chaney fans reap the benefits of author Michael F.  Blake's 6 years of research.  Of the many things we learn:  the son, born  to deaf parents and his early mastery of pantomime for the sake of  communicating with (and entertaining) them.  His rather extensive list of  theater credits where he practiced and honed his skills at make-up. His  entry into films and the amazing body of work that resulted. His rise from  bit player to hugely popular character-actor, adored by the public and  respected by his peers.  His marriages.   All this and much, much more (who  knew that Chaney was an adept dancer!).  A filmography (as complete as can  be known), chronology of major events in Chaney's life, and even a glossary  of make-up terminology is also provided.   <br />  Two highlights:  numerous,  never-before-seen (at least by me) photos and Blake (himself a make-up  artist) reveals the secrets behind many of the actor's &quot;thousand  faces&quot;, at the same time dispelling many inaccurate &quot;facts&quot;  that have been perpetuated over the years concerning said make-up  creations.  <br />  Whether you're a fan of Chaney or of film history in  general, you will find this book invaluable.	2000-06-16
US	50011256	R3921I65DQ87HE	0345433297	38926947	Nightshade	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Good entertainment	Nightshade is the first book I've read of Saul's in many a year, and turned out to be pleasantly entertaining thriller.       For the first 2/3 of the book, Nightshade pleasantly reminded me of the original HAUNTING  movie.  Psychological in nature, we wonder does the ghost of Cynthia really  exist, or does she live only in the mind of the mother, Joan?  Only in the  final 1/3 does the book veer sharply out of psychological horror into a  more graphic vein.             Other aspects of the book that I liked:  the  characterization is very good.  I came to feel something for each of the  characters, whether it be hatred, concern, etc.  With the possible  exception of Joan's mother, all the characters are fully fleshed-out.   Another nice point, and somewhat rare for a &quot;horror&quot; novel, is  that the characters actions all seem legit.  The actions they perform all  seem to be what a regular person would do under the situation(s). No one  develops superhuman characteristics (such as heroism) in the last pages of  the book as seems to norm for a novel of this sort.   This is a nice  surprise.  And, the book kept me reading.  I'd have to describe this book  as a definite page-turner.                  Only a few quibbles kept me  from giving this book 5 stars.  Some of the action and passages are a bit  repetitive.  A good example is that I don't know how many times we read  that a character thinks they are alone in a room, hears something, then  &quot;spins around&quot;.  Also, the action at book's end is a bit  predictible.  Lastly, the book is suspenseful, but unfortunately, not  genuinely horrifying.  Saul's attempts to actually horrify the reader fail  with me because the action(s) or the gore felt more like they were thrown  in for the potential effect more than the fact that it actually needed to  be included/described.   But those minor complaints aside, Nightshade is an  enjoyable, satisfying thriller, better when the horror is psychological and  implied than when it explodes to being realistic and graphic, but very good  oveall.	2000-06-15
US	50011256	R3UT9QJK3QZ9PJ	0312871996	85474640	The Light of Other Days	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Disappointing entry by one of my fave writers	Light Of Other Days was a disappointment for me.     It's hard as a fan to read a new Clarke novel and find almost nothing new, idea-wise.  Clarke and Baxter do manage to put an interesting twist on the old science fiction  concept of looking into the past and the effect it has on humanity, but  aside from that, I've seen almost all this before.  <br />  Clarke loves the  idea of having a woman president, and as usual, we have one here.  One of  the major causes of strife in the near future of our planet is the lack of  water, and in LOOD, we have countries going to war for it.  This has been  done way too often. You'll also find a return to the concept of an Overmind  that we first read in Childhood's End.  And most disheartening to me:  can  you believe that the major threat to the Earth in this book (aside from the  collapse of personal privacy) is a big ole piece of rock in space that is  on a collision course with Earth, threatening to end all life?  How could  Clarke have gone with (or agreed to) one of the most worn-out cliches in  all science fiction?  There are even more cliches to be found, but the  desire not to spoil any plot surprises keeps me from mentioning them.     <br />  The characterizations do not have much depth.  None of the characters  are sufficiently worthy of being cared about.  They are all self-centered,   and when situations occur when this changes, it feels contrived and forced.    The ending in my opinion is pretty disappointing.  An attempt for a big  2001-ish type journey through history ending with  a sappy attempt to  inspire hope in the human race (and the reader).  I didn't buy it.  It  worked in 2001, but it doesn't work here.  Also, the resolution to the BIG  OLE ROCK is a cop-out.         A most disappointing read for this (big)fan  of Clarke.  There is not much new here for fans of science fiction and even  the rehashing of old Clarke ideas and concepts are uninteresting and tired.	2000-06-12
US	50011256	R2LMYI5NTTEVED	038529929X	313045692	Hannibal: A Novel	Books	1	10	14	N	N	If you MUST read this book...BORROW IT!	While an author is certainly entitled to write whatever book he/she wishes, one would think that they would feel SOME sort of responsibility to their readers/fans, in addition to remaining true to their fictional  creations that have come before. <br />Thomas Harris does neither of these  with HANNIBAL. After RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, one reads  HANNIBAL and comes away thinking that someone else must have written this  book. This is not the Thomas Harris writing that we have come to love. <br />   Gone is the tight, suspenseful writing of the previous two books. There is  no suspense and the writing is poor.  The writing consists mainly of lines  like:  &quot;Clarice did THIS...&quot; or &quot;Dr. Lecter likes  THAT...&quot;.       HANNIBAL is all over the place.  Too many locations,  too many superfilous characters, too much verbiage.  More is not always  better.  Unlike DRAGON and SOTL, which concentrated mainly on the  protagonist and one or two other main characters and the suspense built  from those interactions, HANNIBAL has a huge cast of supporting players  that we're supposed to care about and don't.  (Is/was Barney REALLY  necessary in this book?)  And, is Clarice the protagonist here or is  Lecter?  This confusion hurts the story, especially since I don't WANT  Lecter to be a hero! <br />  HANNIBAL is too big, too sprawling.  Example:  we  have a huge middle section that takes place in Florence.  An Italian police  officer works to have Lecter captured.  This whole subplot is not only  useless, but the denouement is completely predictable.  We KNOW how it's  going to end and it doesn't advance the plot at all (except to point out to  us just how &quot;cultured&quot; Hannibal Lecter is). <br />  Harris' attempts  at &quot;thrills&quot; are failures.  There ARE NO thrills, there is no  suspense. The fate of Starling's nemesis at book's end (at the dinner  table) is ludicrous.  And Harris couldn't come up with a better (and  scarier) agent of revenge than killer PIGS? <br />  Lastly, and most  importantly, there are the main characters.  Hannibal Lecter and Clarice  Starling are completely (pardon the expression) butchered.  The young,  confident, capable Clarice Starling becomes little more than a mindless  zombie by novel's end.  And Hannibal Lecter, who we've come to love as a  sheer monster, is made to be an almost acceptable human being.  His  monsterousness is &quot;explained&quot;.  Hannibal Lecter has become CHIC!         It's almost as though Harris had contempt for the success of his  characters...or his readers... and Harris said, &quot;I'll show them.&quot;   And HANNIBAL is the result.  Well, Harris showed us.  Now I'll show him.   I won't be purchasing any further novels from Mr. Harris based on the  mess/disappointment that HANNIBAL is.	2000-06-05
US	50011256	RMNIQ12UAO93	0440206154	247672694	Red Dragon	Books	5	11	12	N	N	Great book only slightly flawed	Through other reviews the plot of Red Dragon is pretty well spelled out.  So I'll skip a synopsis. Red Dragon is one of the finest thrillers I've read in many years.  The book is very well plotted, the characters are  fleshed out, the pace is brisk, and the tension is kept up through most of  the book and of course, as mentioned numerous times, this book marks  Hannibal Lecter's first (albeit small) appearance. <br />A surprise to the  book is the way so much time and back story is given to the  antagonist/killer.  We spend a great deal of time with Francis Dolarhyde,  experiencing the childhood and early adult life that led to his present  condition.  This brought back very pleasant memories of some of author  Robert Bloch's earliest novels, in which most, if not all the story was  told from the antagonist/killer's point-of-view.  Francis is not your  typical serial killer of many of today's novels, where the killer basically  is unsympathetic and whose motives are of your typical, done-too-many-times  revenge variety.  Francis, although a vicious killer, is also quite  sympathetic in his way.   Three quibbles.  First, although a pleasant  surprise on one hand, I feel that a little TOO much time was spent on  Dolarhyde's background.  We get the idea very early on, and the rest feels  like excessive overkill.  Second, the ending (don't worry, I'm not going to  give it away), can easily be seen coming and is not a surprise. <br />   Lastly, (and this is not a fault of the book itself) I'd seen the movie  that this book was based on, MANHUNTER, before I read this book.  Because  the movie follows the book very closely, much of the additional delicious  suspense that would have been there for me was missed.  I knew what was  coming.  But not to discourage people in the same shoes as I, be heartened  by the fact that the ending of the movie does NOT follow the book! <br />   Despite this pre-knowledge of events, I must say Red Dragon kept me turning  the pages.  I didn't stay up all night and read this book, but I DID look  forward to getting to it each day that I was reading it.  It's that good.	2000-05-27
US	50011256	R2FZTKXTFSYJP5	0786405538	388566029	Women in Horror Films, 1930s	Books	5	7	7	N	N	wonderful look at the distaff players of horror films	In the many chroniclings of the history of the Golden Age  of Horror, women have always been horribly short shrifted. Tomes have been written about Karloff and Lugosi.  Even directors Whale and Browning have enjoyed volumes written on their lives and films.  But aside from an occasional  story on Elsa's turn as the Monster's &quot;mate&quot;, or Carroll  Borland's life-long infatuation with Lugosi, the history of women in our  genre is pitifully lacking.   Until now.  Author Gregory Mank takes a huge  step to rectify this situation by shining a well-deserved and much-overdue  light (torch?) on the women whose contributions to the early horror  classics have been both overlooked and under-appreciated for far too long.    Concentrating on the classics of the 30s, Elsa Lanchester, Helen Chandler,  Gloria Stuart, Carroll Borland, Fay Wray, Zita Johann and even high-pitched  screamer Una O'Connor, join a long, dis- tinguished list of actresses who  have their lives and careers presented to us by Mank.   Each artist  receives a mini-bio, which includes stage and screen appearances.  Of  particular interest (and a highlight of the book) is a detailed and  engaging look into each actresses' &quot;signature&quot; horror film,  revealing dates, salaries, production notes and stories of co-stars and  directors.  Punctuated into this are insights and other information  provided by research done by the author or the  reminiscences of the  subject herself.  These wonderful personal <br />anecdotes were culled from  interviews with Mank by a surprising (to this reviewer) number of the  actresses who were (and some who happily still are) with us at the time of  the author's research.   Mank's skill lies in pretty much allowing each  subject's life to  tell its own story.  So doing, each actress takes on a  new life for the reader, a life whose existence had previously only been  hinted at.  They emerge from being known as simply labels:  &quot;the   victim&quot;, the &quot;haplessheroine&quot; or &quot;the monster&quot; to  be revealed as real flesh and blood women.  Women who are intelligent,  opinionated, witty, hard-working and passionate.  Not merely characters...  but three-dimensional character actresses.  A wonderful and deserving  achievement indeed.   With this book (and a companion volume, which  chronicles our favorite ladies of the 40s), Mank adds yet again to his  already formidable  legacy as THE chronicler of the Golden Age of Horror,  this time adding the heretofore missing point-of-view (and warmth) of the  distaff players.   Always an interesting read, generously illustrated with  many wonderful (and unique?) photos, this book is well worth the (usual)  hefty  McFarland price tag, and is an essential addition to any classic  horror film buff's collection.	2000-04-29
US	50011256	RTS5PH5YWSZ0S	034541103X	943816892	A Reporter's Life	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Fascinating look into the stories behind the news	Although an avid reader of biographies, I am usually not a fan of memoirs that incorporate events of history. I usually find them far too dry and uninteresting with their rigid, chronological structure. A REPORTER'S LIFE by Walter Cronkite, however, is a rare exception. Cronkite narrates his own  personal history while touching on many of the most significant events and  people of the past 50+ years. Cronkite does so in a engaging and  page-turning narrative.<br />As seen through the eyes of perhaps the most  respected and trusted reporter of this century, events such as our  involvement in war, particularly Vietnam and the division of our country  over it, Watergate, the Nuremberg trials, South Africa, Communism, the  first steps toward peace between Egypt and Israel, the beginnings of the  Civil Rights movement, the assassination of John Kennedy, the NASA space  program, and many more are given a more personal, and sometimes different,  perspective than the &quot;history&quot; we have come to know or have been  led to believe.<br />The Kennedys, Menachem Begin, Anwar Sadat, Martin Luther  King, Jr., George Patton, Jimmy Hoffa, Neil Armstrong, Rosa Parks, Adolf  Hitler, and our presidents: from FDR to George Bush, are just a few of the  many figures to be found here. Cronkite not only recounts stories about  them, but in many cases gives us heretofore unknown and sometimes  surprising insights into these colorful and complex personalities.<br />I  found each of his recollections about these important people and events in  history both absorbing and entertaining. Having personally reported on all  these events, Cronkite is able to make them come much more alive and make  them far more interesting than any typical history book's dry recital of  facts and dates.<br />But it is Cronkite's personal history of the development  of media journalism, and his own career in it, that makes for the more  compelling story. From his beginnings as a newspaper boy, to newspaper  reporter, radio announcer, becoming the first news &quot;anchor&quot; for  the CBS Evening News, to the sad state journalism is in danger of becoming,  as news stations are taken over by corporate conglomerates, more interested  in &quot;entertaining&quot; the public in an effort for higher ratings and  profits, than in educating and informing said public, we follow both the  neophyte journalism student and newly developing industry as they grow up  and mature side-by-side through the intervening years.<br />A REPORTER'S LIFE  is a very fine book. It is highly recommended for anyone interested in the  life of one of our most distinguished news reporters and human beings, or a  brief, but personal look into the history of media journalism.	2000-04-25

He was, however, a man of many varied interests and talents, far beyond those even most fans might be aware of. The life of Vincent  Price could be summed up in one word: full.  Price did so much with his  life that the author's job of bringing it to one book must have been  daunting.  But Victoria accomplishes this task quite well.  From traveling  to and receiving his education in Europe, to his first major stage role  (and huge hit) in Victoria Regina, his stage, television and film work,  marriages, children, interests in travel, public-speaking, cooking, writing  and well-known and life-long love of art are all here.  For those who must  have something a little more lurid, heretofore-unknown facts about his  involvement with the Fifties McCarthy witch-hunts and the rather shocking  deal he made, and his sexuality are touched on. The greatest achievement of  this book, however, owes as much to Vincent Price himself as it does to the  author. Throughout his life Vincent wrote (and kept) an enormous amount of  correspondence.  With this wealth of personal documents at her disposal,  Victoria sprinkles quotes from Vincent throughout the book. Thus, we are  fortunate to have Vincent's life unfold before us as if Vincent himself  were relating his own story.  His triumphs, failures, joys, fears, pain.  Vincent talks to us about each. Never before has a person's life,  documented by another, been brought so close to the reader, or made so  personal. Many thanks are due, both to Victoria and Vincent for this  wonderful accomplishment. There are a few downsides to the book, however.  The book is lacking when the author discusses her father's films. She has  over the years admitted that she never really watched her father's horror  pictures. As such, we regretfully do not gain many insights into the making  of those films that we didn't already know from other books. This is a huge  opportunity lost.  And sadly, the slant that comes across when the author  discusses her (deceased) stepmother, actress Coral Browne, is decidedly  negative.  While entitled to include or discard facts as one wishes (for  this book is as much a memoir of Victoria's life as it is a bio of  Vincent's), one wishes the author hadn't been quite so needful (and used a  bio of her father as the vehicle) to paint Browne in such a bad light.  The  uplifting, joyful and celebratory narrative of Vincent's life comes to an  abrupt halt when the author turns her attention to detailing her  stepmother's perceived faults.ty lost.
