After repeatedly moving from place to place from the time her mother died to her senior year in high school, it was something she learned to pick up on.  Since she never expected to stay in one place for too long, she rarely tried to make friends and never unpacked her suitcases.  It didn't make sense to her, if she was just going to leave anyway.<br /><br />When she moves into a house Seattle, she doesn't expect anything to be any different.  But on her first day at Beacon High, she meets a fantastic new guy, who happens to be school president, on every sports team at the school, and a complete 'Big Man on Campus.'  Jo's experience with people like Alex Crawford is that they always ignore new girls like her.  But not only was she wrong about this, she also fell in love with him.  Or, as much in love as you can be when you're a senior in high school. For the first time in a long time, Jo has a guy who she likes, who likes her back.  She also has a best friend, Elaine Golden.  And everything seems to be going perfect.<br /><br />At least, until her dad tells her that they will fake their deaths, because they are part of the witness protection program and the guy Jo's dad has been trying to put in jail for the longest time is trying to kill them.  Which, actually, he has been trying to do ever since Jo's first move, and is the reason she has always had to move so often.<br /><br />So Jo and her dad get in a 'car crash,' and she starts all over again at Royer High, this time as Claire Calloway.  Jo gets a complete makeover to ensure that no one realizes her true identity.  However, Jo cannot let Alex go without saying goodbye.  So she visits Alex on what she thinks will be her last time at Beacon High.  Alex sees her but he does the thing she last expects: he panics.  Well, that and he tells everyone he's seen Jo O'Connors ghost.<br /><br />AS the new star reporter of Royer High, Claire (Jo) is forced to spend more time at Beacon to report on the students' reactions to Jo's 'ghost.'  Claire also meets Mark London, a pushy, smart, and sarcastic reporter, who just happens to think Claire Calloway and Jo O'Connor are the same person.  And if anyone can figure out the truth, Mark can.  Which is a thing Claire badly does not want to happen.  So she tries to get rid of Jo's ghost once and for all.<br /><br />A thing that is way harder than it sounds.  Through it all Jo/Claire learns some important lessons about life, love, and...ghosts.<br /><br />Just like all of Cameron Dokey's other books, this was fantastic.  It was completely original and totally exciting, even without the sword clashing, magic wielding heroines that I usually read about.  Jo's adventure was just as hard to put down.  With her truely funny comments and witty comebacks, Jo is one character that you will never forget.  This book, along with others in the Simon Pulse Teen Romantic Comedy series will keep you laughing and searching for the perfect guy would take your breath away.  At least, if he were real.

This historial fiction book was so real I actually looked up the characters to see whether they were real or not.  This book travels back and forth within two time periods.  This is romance set both in the Revolutionary times and the early 1900's.  Peggy Grahame is the main character, and she travel's to her uncle's ancestral estate of Rest-an-be-thankful after her father dies.  Before she reaches the estate, however, she meets a handsome British scholar, Pat.  But when Pat and Peggy reach Rest-and-be-thankful, Peggy's uncle forbids Pat to ever come to the house again, for no particular reason.  As Peggy's uncle never seems to have time for her, Peggy explores the house and finds several objects linked with her Revolutionary ancestors.  After finding each object, she meets the ghost it was linked to and they tell her about their story of the War.  The first ghost to tell his story is Richard Grahame, and he talks of his attempts at capturing the clever British marauder, Peaceable Drummond Sherwood.  It was Richard's enemy Peaceable, however, who led him into a romance with the woman he never thought he would forgive.  Then after finding a bean pot, Peggy meets her third ghost, Richard's sister, Barbara Grahame.  She tells of Aunt Susanna's imprisonment and her escape to see her brother on Christmas day.  Before she reaches her brother, she is unknowingly captured by Peaceable Sherwood.  Incidentally, Barbara finds him attractive, charming, and clever, and just can't help falling in love with him.  When she does turn him in, Barbara misses him more and more each day, and even tries to free him from jail. A short time after, Peggy meets Peaceable Sherwood face to face.  He tells of his escape from jail and his last visit to Barbara before he rejoins his army and the end of the Revolutionary War.  The one thing I didn't really like about this book was the ending.  You never really got to know peggy, and there doesn't seem like a good reason for why Pat fell in love with her, or why she fell in love with Pat.  What I wanted to know was what happened to the ghosts.  But despite the ending, this book is a must read, and you'll never be able to put it down.e a good reason for why Pat fell in love with her, or why she fell in love with Pat.

Rose Daughter is very different from the original tale.  In Robin McKinley's second version, all thsisters are beautiful.  None are arrogant or spoiled.  Each is uniquely characterized and beautifully described.  Lionheart, Jeweltongue, and Beauty are down-to-earth and sensible.  The sentences are descriptive, but sometimes too much so so that the excitement is taken out of the moment.  But don't let that stop you from reading this fantastic book!  The Beast is also wonderfully depicted.  He seems perfect for Beauty.  It's wonderful that, unlike the traditional fairytale, the Beast has a more complex, harder to solve problem that confines him to his palace.

This is the second book of the Crown and the Court Duet.  This book starts with teenage Countess Meliara of Tlanth cleaning and repairing her family's house and building her new library.  Her brother, Bran, who has been staying in Remalna's capital ever since the downfall of Remalna's evil king, makes a sudden visit and brings with him his new fiance and the Marquis of Shevraeth.  Despite her loathing of court life and courtiers themselves, Mel goes with her brother back to Remalna-city to settle personal scores.<br />Mel has changed a lot since her revolt against the late king of Remalna.  She has become more humble and wary of her actions, so she does not make as many mistakes.  She also learns of her ignorance and tries to change it by reading every book she can.  One thing I really enjoyed about this book was the descriptions of court life, which, in my opinion, were just as good as the descriptive battle scenes.  Spending time at court changes Mel too.  She becomes more aware of everything, and shows flashes of being a potential ruler.<br />At court, Mel also learns about the flirtations that take place at court.  A very intriguing part of this book was Mel's corrispondence, and courtship, with her secret admirer, to whom she constantly turned to for advice.  Although for those who can take a hint, Mel's \\"Unknown\\" is obvious, the moment in which he finally shows Mel who he is so romantic it really doesn't matter.<br />The book finishes with a bang, where a rival tries to take the throne, using very powerful magic.  He threatens Mel and the entire kingdom to death if he cannot become king.  This is the only part of the book with real action, but I still find it better than Crown Duel.  A very satisfying conclusion, in which Mel finds happiness and love at last, in a place she never thought she'd find it.	2003-09-21

Maybe 10 or 15 year way okay back then, but being 20 year older than the other person is too_*ugh*_!

In this book, Keladry of Mindelan, a.k.a. Kel, has arrived from the Yamani Islands and decided to become the first known female knight.  But its not easy.  As if the endless training weren't enough, she has to deal with bullies and mean pranks, and the fact that the man in charge of the training, Lord Wyldon, seems to hate her.  Not to mention the fact that she has to go through 1 year of probation, something none of the boys have to go through.  But Kel is determined.  She knows that if she passes this year, it proves not only that she can be a Lady Page, but girls can do anything.	2003-09-01

Kel has become a squire to Lord Raoul,who is in charge of the Kings Own.  Separated from her friends for the first time since she was a page, Kel must face the Realm's dangers on her own.  Lord Raoul teaches her to be a warrior.  She finds out who kidnapped Lalasa in Page(Protector of the Small 2) and has to deal with the unfairness that the ofender only has to pay a fine.  She falls in love with her friend, Cleon.  She also prepares for her Ordeal.  In the Chamber of Ordeal, she sees a startling vision, which shows her what she must do after she becomes a knight.  I admire Kel not only for her courage and strength, but that fact that she actually learned to controll her anger, even when what the others did seemed unforgivable.	2003-09-01

In fact, they are so good that I got really depressed when I finished the series.  I'm going to have trouble fining a good book to replace this one.  It has all the stuff for teens: adventure, excitement, and most of all, romance.  In this series, Alanna of Trebond is determined to be a knight.  During her long year training to become a knight and trying to prove herself worthy of being one, she fights the Nameless Ones of the Black City, defeats the evil duke Roger, trains shamans for the Bazhir tribe, the Bllody Hawk, and quests for the Dominion Jewel.  Throughout the series Alanna proves herself not only worthy of being the first female page, squire, and knight in a century, but worthy to be the first female King's Champion.  This series is an absolute must-read, and I don't think there will ever be a series better than this one!	2003-08-28

I really want to know how she learned to write like that!  Ms. Pierce made me feel like I was actually Daine.  I mean, when I read about Diane getting drugged, it made me so mad.  I wanted to kill him.  It was so satisfying to read about Daine destroying the palace.  I was sad when I heard about Numair dying, and it made me hate Ozorne even more.  When Daine lost her temper when she heard about Numair, it made me think there could be something between them(?!).  After I read this book, I knew I had to read all of Ms. Pierce's books.  This book is amazing, you have to read it!<br />By the way, I HATE Ozorne.	2003-08-22

I have read all of Ms. Pierce's books, including the Circle of Magic and the Cirle opens.  I read these after Alanna and the Immortals and they were kind of disapointing.  These books are very well written and the writing isn't complicated, but I don't think they were quite up to Alanna and The Immortals' standards.	2003-08-22

Once I read the first one, I knew I had to finish the series.  This book has everything: adventure, excitement, romance.  In this series, Alanna a Trebond dreams of becoming the first lady knight in a century.  So she switches places with her brother & pretends to be a boy.  Throughout the series, Alanna has many adventures like going to the Black City, defeating and evil sorcerer, training shamans for the Bloodly Hawk, & finding the Dominian Jewel.  Her hardest task was to protect her identity, which stayed hidden until she became a knight.  I love the romance too!  She has the task of choosing between three guys who all seem to be hopelessly in love with her (well, not exactly hopelessly in love, but close enough).  I got so mad and Jon when he said she was unfeminine.  How can you be a knight if you're worring about your hair or your nails?  Anyway, the series is great, you have to read it.  And after you finish this series, I recommend the Immortals and the Proctector of the Small.  I've read all of them, and I was so sad when the story of Tortall was over.  I don't think I'll ever find any books better than these.	2003-08-20

This is the first book in the Song of the Lioness Quartet. In this book, Alanna of Trebond is determined to become a knight...so she disguises as a boy to train at the palace.  It wasn't easy.  She soon learned that she needed to work hard every moment of the day.  She quickly made friends with Prince Jonathan, Raoul of Goldenlake, and Duke Gareth's son(also named Gareth).  It was hard to keep her secret because she had to deal with \\"becoming a woman\\" and everything. After saving Jon from the fatal disease, Sweating Fever, Jon's cousin comes to the palace.  Upon meeting him, Alanna feels extremely ditrustful, without knowing why.  She feels that Duke Rodger is plotting to take the throne...by killing Jon! He dares Jon to go to the evil Black City to defeat the Nameless People. Alanna goes with him & uses her mysterious magical sword to prevent the People from killing them.
