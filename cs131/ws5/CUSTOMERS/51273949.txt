Berney describes how you can find lost things by communicating with your basic self, and how you can arrange to meet your soul mate by working with your high self. She shares some essential tips for effective prayer that are bound to be helpful for everyone, and outlines an extraordinarily powerful Hawaiian technique for manifesting called the \\"Ha Rite\\".

Author Rima Morrell shares her own personal experiences with the ways of Hawaiian kahuna along with her translations of ancient Hawaiian chants, and shares some of the key similarities and differences between beliefs and practices of Hawaiian kahunas and those of other ancient indigenous peoples, such as the Hopi. Morrell explains how so much ancient Hawaiian knowledge was kept secret for so long, as she brings us on her journey of discovery. Morrell's juicy style of writing breathes fresh life into such fascinating topics as fire walking, the death prayer, Hawaiian lunar astrology, and shamanic power of the erotic Hawaiian hula dance. Most importantly, Morrell describes the practical process by which we can each create our reality by being aware of our high, middle and low selves. I highly recommend this wonderful book to anyone interested in Hawaii, shamanism, and spiritual growth!	2005-09-15

Books	5	13	13	N	N	A True Guiding Light	WHAT IF YOU CAN CHANGE THE WORLD is a book of questions and quotations which are designed to help us suspend critical judgment long enough to open our minds to all possibility. With 200 pages of questions and quotes and 75 pages of references, WHAT IF YOU CAN CHANGE THE WORLD is a masterpiece of raw, transformational power.

While not all artists see the world as shaman do, there are some artists who see, dream, and perform in much the same way as the shaman. Some of the 27 artists included in TECHNICIANS OF ECSTASY are: Vincent Van Gogh, Paul Cezanne, Alex Grey, Henri Rousseau, Salvador Dali, Man Ray, Ann McCoy, and Jonathan Borofsky.<br /><br />What makes this book so fabulous is the way it demonstrates ways that spiritual meaning and wisdom is at the heart of much of the world's best art. The world's best artists know how to break out of habitual modes of looking, and in sharing their visions, empower all who view their art by helping people open their eyes to new ways of seeing. Author Mark Levy explains, \\"In shifting attention from common sense or 'consensus reality,' artists as shamans succeed in expanding their consciousness and the consciousness of their communities and offer blueprints for spiritual development.\\" I particularly loved the shamanic techniques mentioned to stimulate creativity, as these exercises indeed are part of the core of all shamanic training: isolation, not-doing, prolonged looking, the strong eye, and setting up dreaming.<br /><br />TECHNICIANS OF ECSTASY is essential reading for everyone who is excited by meaningful art, as well as for anyone wishing to better understand how to see the world through the artist's and the shaman's eyes. I give this book my highest recommendation!	2005-08-14

According to David, some of the biggest myths about eating are well-intentioned, yet contribute to ever-increasing girth. Starting with one of the most widely believed myths, \\"the best way to lose weight is to eat less and exercise more,\\" David describes how people who attempt to follow that old advice so often end up frustrated. As David points out, \\"What you eat is only half the equation of good nutrition. How you eat is the other half.\\"<br /><br />David describes the eight universal metabolizers that have the biggest effect on whether we gain or lose weight: relaxation, quality, awareness, rhythm, pleasure, thought, story, the sacred. We don't overeat because we lack willpower or put our metabolism into starvation mode, but when meals are deficient in one of the eight universal metabolizers. Food eaten in an anxious rush will trigger physiological stress responses that decrease our calorie burning capacity at the same time as we lose the value of the nutrients.<br /><br />At a time when the benefits of meditation are being formally acknowledged, it's refreshing to see a book that cites scientific sources that describe a metabolic power of relaxation. I love the way Marc David includes scientific research studies alongside case histories and exercises. Did you know that your gut has a brain? The enteric nervous system in your body has more nerve cells than your spinal column, at over one hundred million neurons, and it moves through nightly 90 minute cycles as if it were dreaming. Marc David asserts that the amazing differences between French and American food habits and weights are that while the French eat generally fattier foods, they slow down and savor long lunches as the biggest meals of their days... while Americans eat on the run in a constant state of stress.<br /><br />THE SLOW DOWN DIET proposes something that seems almost too good to be true... a way to savor meals and consistently lose weight doing so. By simply being \\"awake at the plate\\" and not doing something distracting or stressful while eating, but instead enjoying every moment of your meals... David assures us that we can lose weight.LOW DOWN DIET proposes something that seems almost too good to be true... a way to savor meals and consistently lose weight doing so.

Sixty seven leading experts on health and healing share their most intimate, heartfelt, and analytical assessments of exactly what's going on in the field of mind-body medicine. Included inside this book is a companion DVD that features interviews with health professionals who share their vision for where the field of healing is headed.<br /><br />CONSCIOUSNESS & HEALING is the brain and love child of the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS), whose goal is to explore the frontiers of human consciousness. While the breadth and depth of this book defies description, it's safe to say that CONSCIOUSNESS & HEALING is currently the most comprehensive and up-to-date reference book on the subjects of complementary and alternative medicine, integral medicine, and mind-body medicine.<br /><br />Some of my favorite ideas from this book are the notion of what it really means to grow old gracefully, the return of prayer, and the idea of the patient as being inextricably intertwined in society and the environment. Now that increasing numbers of patients seek complementary and alternative forms of healing to the more traditional chemical and surgical procedures, there is a need for the healing community to establish a better vision of how to treat patients as people who matter, and whose thoughts and feelings affect their health.<br /><br />CONSCIOUSNESS & HEALING is a marvelous reference book that will stimulate discussion between healing professionals and people seeking healing, and help us all figure out what new model of health care we can best create.	2005-06-02

Author Dr. Sally Rhine Feather shares the findings of the Duke Parapsychology Laboratory and the Rhine Research Center since the early 1930s in a friendly manner that invites readers to take a look at some of the startling intuitive insights of hundreds of ordinary individuals. THE GIFT devotes an entire chapter to sharing stories of ESP between mothers and their children, another to the ESP of children, another to ESP in romance, another for messages from the dead, and several to ESP related to premonitions of various disasters. THE GIFT is filled with fascinating findings, such as the conclusion that we tend to have ESP experiences most often with people who share close personal emotional ties -- such as parents, children, siblings, spouses and friends. 57% of people who shared stories of such experiences noted that they received intuitive insights such as precognitive flashes of something about to happen in the form of dreams, while 30% noted sudden intuitive impressions while they were awake, and 13% experienced visions so real that they seemed to actually be happening.<br /><br />I was intrigued to learn that 30% of all psychic messages from loved ones involve death, 40% involve news of accidents... so that a full 70% of ESP messages about others are tuned in to potential negative disruptions in the lives of those we care about.  The authors assert, \\"When any two members of a family are emotionally close, the death of one can generate psychic shock wave capable of immediately reaching the other.\\" Potentially lethal situations also seem capable of reaching loved ones very quickly. It's interesting to note that the majority of ESP messages people receive about themselves involve precognitive warnings of accidents and injuries as well.<br /><br />THE GIFT raises the excellent question, \\"Is fate inevitable?\\" There are those who argue that if you can make a successful intervention and change the future, then by definition, no precognition took place. Others assert that we see possible and probable futures, so it is possible to see one future and actually experience something else. There is no scientific test yet developed to determine whether a future envisioned and then averted is one that might have ever come to be real... yet people receiving strong impressions of danger appear to be able to change the future.<br /><br />People made changes to avert disaster in 162 of 433 cases reported to the Rhine Research Center over the past sixty years. Since ESP comes to us in the same form and manner as our ordinary mental processes, it can be difficult to distinguish between meaningful messages and \\"noise.\\" Nevertheless, of the 162 individuals who sensed potential danger, nearly two thirds of them succeeded by recognizing the significance of their psychic impressions and acting quickly and effectively, even when some aspects of their vision were not entirely accurate and people around them did not fully cooperate.<br /><br />THE GIFT is a book that will give you an exhilarating sense of how it feels to receive ESP impressions, and a sense of the breadth and depth of the ESP experience.re those who argue that if you can make a successful intervention and change the future, then by definition, no precognition took place.

Author Winter Robinson provides exercises and shares fascinating real-life stories to help us better understand how beautifully all the aspects of our lives come together when we practice listening to intuition and reading the more subtle road signs in life. The hidden order Robinson describes \\"is rapidly making itself known, suggesting to every one of us that there is spiritual evolution going on; that we have the potential to rid the world of fear, confusion, chaos, and greed and bring humankind into harmony with nature and the cosmos.\\" Much of the confusion in the world can be cleared when we take time to meditate, feel the energies all around us, and discern the difference between what we truly need and what we may have thought we wanted.<br /><br />A HIDDEN ORDER is written in two main sections; the first section introduces stories from Robinson's life, basic principles related to the hidden order, ideas about health and love and death, and chapters on manifesting with creative power and experiencing a shared consciousness. The second section contains chapters with master practices for dealing with ego and beliefs, quieting the mind, understanding dreams, and setting intention.<br /><br />What I love best about A HIDDEN ORDER are the stories that Robinson shares from her fascinating life.  I also love the way she includes references to relevant studies and research throughout her book, and the way her book provides a such a wonderful way to discover the joys of seeing and understanding life's hidden order and grand designs!	2005-03-11

The premise of this book is that powerful healing can be found in the power of our dreams, because they help us get in touch with feelings and thoughts that otherwise remain buried deep in our subconscious. Bonapartian demonstrates through his own life experiences how dreams can be accessed even while awake, in order to facilitate soul retrieval and regain a long-lost sense of empowerment and joy in living.<br /><br />STORIES OF OUR LIVES is told as a narrative which begins in autobiographical form with the death and burial of Bonapartian's alcoholic mother. This death marked a beginning for Bonapartian, in which he began to experience contact with his mother in his visions and dreams. The conflict between wishing to just move on with life and take time learning from powerfully emotional dreams was one that lead Bonapartian to share his dreams and visions in a dream group, so that he could experience complete healing and the full power and truth of his dreams.<br /><br />STORIES OF OUR LIVES is an inspirational must-read book for all adult children of alcoholics, for it describes one man's success story in confronting and overcoming a lifetime burden of guilt, terror, and grief.

Dirk refuses to open his refrigerator, follows cars that seem to know when they're going when he's lost, and prefers to consider impossible scenarios over highly improbable ones. He also has a penchant for taking things that aren't his... although no matter how badly things seem to be going for him, he always seems to manage to end up in the right place at the right time. And perhaps this is the greatest lesson that Dirk Gently has to share.<br /><br />I laughed out loud so often while reading LONG DARK TEA TIME that I cried, and found myself reading and re-reading passages to savor them again and again. Douglas Adams is truly a master story teller, even when dealing with a plot that ping-pongs back and forth between two main character who are coping with extremely unusual (and dare I say impossible) situations. Keeping track of the plot was challenging at times, but well worth the effort.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and now plan to make sure I read everything Adams has written!	2005-03-07

Obviously, one can gain insight from anything, but I was concerned that perhaps the creator of this deck might lean too far toward the science to provide meaningful readings.<br /><br />From the first moment I saw the actual cards and companion book for the UNIVERSE CARDS, I realized that this is an extraordinary deck. Not only are the pictures on the cards big and beautiful, but they come with vivid descriptions which are perfectly suited to conveying the sense of the core idea for each card. After seeing the deck used to do readings for several different people, I saw how on target these cards can be, and how wonderfully they can capture a wide variety of feelings and moods.<br /><br />I highly recommend UNIVERSE CARDS to anyone who loves astronomy and everyone who is interested in combining science and intuition.	2005-03-07

Author David Oakford set his pride aside to describe every aspect of his experience, including the not-so-flattering descriptions of how he came so close to death through a drug overdose. As each gland and organ in his body shut down, one by one, he could hear and see how it's song and rhythm stilled to silence... until all that remained was an eerie silence. Oakford's attention next turned to his immediate surroundings, and how he was confused to find that although he could move about, running was difficult... and although he could see and hear things, he could not see his reflection in a mirror and nobody seemed to hear him even when he shrieked and cried.<br /><br />SOUL BARED really takes off when Oakford meets his guardian angel, who he calls Bob. Bob helped to explain the meaning of the colored auras that Oakford saw around everyone and everything, describing how each person's aura is useful in viewing to see how much and what kind of work needs to be done for that person's best development. The more brilliant the color, the higher the vibration. Bob went on to describe elemental energy beings, dark souls, the spirit of Gaia and beings of higher vibration, as Oakford looked around at the world through new eyes. The chapters in which Oakford describes meeting a group of angelic spirits are extraordinary for their clarity, as Oakford describes the choice he was given before returning to his body and resuming his life.<br /><br />I am deeply moved by SOUL BARED, as it inspires me to live up my true spiritual nature and original purpose on Gaia at this time. Readers who have had near death experiences will especially love this book, as it's the next best thing to feeling all the agony and ecstasy of a near death experience. I give this book my highest recommendation.	2005-03-06

These large, glossy photos look something like snowflakes, where no two images are identical -- yet certain patterns become immediately apparent.<br /><br />Japanese researcher Masaru Emoto describes in this book how his original quest to depict the natural beauty of water led him to discover that clean, pure water from natural unpolluted sources looks much more brilliant in color and more symmetrical in shape than chemically treated or polluted water. This assertion is made abundantly clear when one views the various images in this book and sees for oneself how chemically treated water crystals appear dark and misshapen while clean water appears bright and jewel- like. Emoto could have stopped his research there and still had an amazing book, but he continued his ground-breaking research to experiment with treating water with a variety of phrases, music, and prayer -- showing how our words, thoughts, and feelings have a visceral effect on water.<br /><br />This extraordinary book is a must for anyone who wishes to see for themselves what effect pollution and stressful thoughts and feelings are having on Earth's water -- and how we can change these effects with meditation, prayer, healing words, and music. Since most of our bodies and most of the surface of the Earth is made of water, THE HIDDEN MESSAGES IN WATER has tremendous significance for us all.	2005-03-01

Judy Borich's book TOUCH AND GO is like a breath of fresh air in the field of interpersonal psychology. I especially love the way energetic fields are described as being the essential basis for understanding interpersonal relationship dynamics. TOUCH AND GO makes it clear how each person has a boundary around their individual energy field, and how there is a boundary around the couple who are in a close relationship... and last but certainly not least there is a boundary in between the two people who are in the relationship. This boundary concept is elegant in its simplicity, and profound in its implications for interpersonal relationship dynamics.<br /><br />When one comprehends these three basic types of boundaries, it becomes clear that one can only speak for oneself, even if one feels strongly that one's partner should agree. When each person feels secure both in their individuality and freedom to disagree, as well as feeling secure in the relationship... something magnificent becomes possible. Such relationships are capable of bringing out the very best in people. TOUCH AND GO provides exercises and descriptions of how to set boundaries, respect one another's boundaries, resolve conflicts, and meet our relationship needs.<br /><br />TOUCH AND GO is an essential book for anyone interested in attaining the best possible relationship with another, who is willing to be the best they can be in order to help their relationship be the best it can be.<br /><br />-- Cynthia Sue Larson, author of \\"Aura Advantage: How the Colors in Your Aura Can Help You Attain What You Desire and Attract Success\\"	2005-01-29

What makes this story such a rare treat is the sense one gets while reading it that it just might be completely true!

Steven Harrison explains that there are serious problems with the three main phases of most romantic relationships (infatuation/falling in love, power struggles, dynamic boredom); all three of these phases of love are built on a foundation of an addiction to separation. This separation is imagined, not real. Only love is real... and each and every one of us can experience the joy of being in love... of being free from attacking and defending... of knowing that we are all as one... and of being one. Everyone can benefit from reading BEING ONE and imagining a world in which all the people can live their lives as one.

Author Arnold Mindell explains how playing with nonconsensus and consensus reality can help one attain a sense of lucid living... of recognizing the \\"Big You.\\" Mindell describes how the Big You creates the world and sees through the illusory nature of consensus reality, to rise above the petty (yet often infuriatingly stressful) situations we find ourselves in. When you are not lucid, the universe can seem inexplicable. When you are lucid, you understand that you can stay present in the cloudedness of your ordinary senses, sensing information around you with highly tuned intuition. In a state of Big You lucidity, even your opponents are understood to be another part of the Big You... and you can find your way to better outcomes than you have ever imagined.<br /><br />I love the way Dreaming While Awake takes the reader on an odyssey of exploring the furthest reaches of consciousness, to discover how reality itself can be a magical symbol that flirts with our awareness. I also love the way Mindell includes real-life examples of how he has felt when he became aware of his own \\"Big You\\" and dealt with difficult situations from that elevated state of mind. Dreaming While Awake is a classic book on the subject of consciousness and reality that is destined to be read and re-read and cherished forever.	2004-12-10

Intuitive consultant Lynn Robinson answers this question as she illuminates the keys to real prosperity, and how to enjoy a life overflowing with more than enough of what you need and want. Robinson shares tips that have helped her thousands of clients realize their dreams over the years, and describes people who are successful, happy and prosperous as, \\"It's as if prosperity and success seek them out. They magnetize what they want to create through the power of their mind and emotion.\\"<br /><br />REAL PROSPERITY helps you listen to your prosperity intuition to discover a personalized roadmap to achieving your goals. REAL PROSPERITY is full of excercises, quotations, and stories that describe a spiritual path to abundance. One of my favorite parts of the book is where Robinson points out that often it's often the bleakest times in our lives that turn out to be launch pads for new opportunities and success. This pattern becomes obvious when successful people look back at their lives... and see how they made the biggest turnarounds in the midst of major life changes.<br /><br />REAL PROSPERITY is written in the very energy of prosperity it describes, so the very act of reading it immediately boosts one's prosperity consciousness.

Most of us have an unfortunate tendency to dwell on problems rather than the good things in our lives... and then we wonder why things just seem to keep getting worse instead of better.<br /><br />Therapists Noelle Nelson and Jeannine LeMare Calaba explain how you can achieve success in every area of your life through transforming your beliefs in THE POWER OF APPRECIATION. Whereas criticism, contempt, defensiveness and stonewalling work to destroy relationships, appreciation can help people feel like they're living in heaven on earth. Nelson and Calaba outline a practical five-step process to make your dreams come true that has proven effective for them with their clients. They also include scientific research and descriptions of individual case histories to help bring their ideas to life, so you can better understand how to harness the power of appreciation in your life. The five steps are: choosing what you desire, determining the feelings behind your desire, weeding out conflicting thoughts and beliefs, launching your vibration of appreciation, and working your appreciation.<br /><br />THE POWER OF APPRECIATION really hits its stride when it examines how appreciation can transform the relationships in our lives. Every relationship at work, at home, and with friends can prosper when one applies its five-step process for developing an appreciative mindset. I highly recommend this book for anyone genuinely interested in creating a better life!	2004-10-07

Larry's journey truly begins when he is startled to hear his dog talking to him... helping him awaken to a much deeper understanding of his life, the universe, and everything. The main premise of GOING DEEPER is that there are millions of \\"Wanderers,\\" advanced souls from distant dimensions, who feel like they are not quite of this world, but need help remembering what they are doing here on Earth at this time.<br /><br />Through discussions with Zeus and several other wise yet irreverent teachers (such as a raccoon, a juniper tree, and stones) Larry explores such diverse topics as consciousness, chakras, finding one's life purpose, and communicating with one's High Self and the Akashic records. GOING DEEPER balances its serious subject matter with zany humor, as it does an outstanding job of combining spiritual concepts from a variety of esoteric teachings into a cohesive whole.<br /><br />My favorite part of GOING DEEPER was the description of the secret to fully awakening through increasing awareness via focused questioning. Many such tools and meditations are provided through GOING DEEPER, which reads like a spiritual self-help book disguised as a novel. I was pleased to find fascinating ideas liberally sprinkled throughout the story, so I'd find myself feeling the happy glow of these shining ideas for days afterward.<br /><br />Spiritual seekers will find pearls of wisdom and belly laughs galore in this playful yet profound exploration of all that is.	2004-10-06

You can't find a more fascinating and delightful book about the nature of time and reality than Fred Alan Wolf's YOGA OF TIME TRAVEL! Chapter One alone is more than worth the price of the book, as it describes how a yoga adept can overcome the five barriers to reaching the state of egoless mind... which is what Wolf explains one needs to do in order to travel through time without a time travel device. THE YOGA OF TIME TRAVEL shares a compelling vision of the nature of time travel by combining essential elements from yoga and physics with extraordinary clarity. Wolf provides readers with the perfect blend of warmth, wit, and scientific detail for readers to grasp such physical concepts as possibility waves, probability waves and qubits. THE YOGA OF TIME TRAVEL is so provocative that you'll want to read it more than once to comprehend the wonderful world of time travel!<br /><br />I was delighted to see how Wolf explains how the so-called time travel paradoxes such as the \\"creativity paradox\\" and the \\"grandfather paradox\\" can be completely resolved when considered in the context of parallel universes. Wolf explains how time travel is no longer relegated to science fiction, but is instead required by current models of the physical world, which moves the burden of proof from defending the possibility of time travel to proving there is any kind of law forbidding it.<br /><br />THE YOGA OF TIME TRAVEL is surely destined to become a classic, as it covers a topic that has never before been addressed with such insight and elegance.

Weighty in both content and physical heft, it manages to be quite the page-turner, by virtue of maintaining effervescent enthusiasm for the subject throughout. While some books discuss one or two relatively narrow aspects of energy medicine, VIBRATIONAL MEDICINE covers a vast assortment of energy healing methodologies.<br />What I love most about VIBRATIONAL MEDICINE is the way so many experimental details are included for the scientific studies it cites. It's easy to gain a big picture overview of how scientific research is steadily progressing in the field of subtle energies. I also love the way that VIBRATIONAL MEDICINE strikes an easy balance between sharing ancient esoteric spiritual teachings, newer vibrational therapies, and scientific research. Some of the most recent developments in vibrational medicine, such as homeopathy, flower essences, and sound healing have deep roots in the past, at the same time as they offer us a welcome array of new options on the road to better health. Readers who are intrigued and open-minded to studying all these areas will find this book an absolute must-read.<br />VIBRATIONAL MEDICINE introduces some key concepts early on that weave their way throughout the rest of the book, such as the principle of resonance. Resonance has been associated with telepathy between individuals, and also with bringing about healing for individuals who have energy imbalances. There are profound benefits to be gained from correctly assessing what kind of frequency will bring about optimal healing, and VIBRATIONAL MEDICINE provides all the juicy details!<br />I highly recommend VIBRATIONAL MEDICINE to anyone interested in a more complete understanding of the energies related to optimal health.<br />-- Cynthia Sue Larson, author of &quot;Aura Advantage: How the Colors in Your Aura Can Help You Attain What You Desire and Attract Success&quot;ct Success&quot;	2004-07-19

Guided by an inner passion to connect directly to divine consciousness, Wennstrom gave away his possessions and began a journey based on complete surrender to life experience. THE INSPIRED HEART shares Wennstrom's personal journal of how he lived for years in a state of grace and faith, discovering divine intelligence and inspiration in a wide breadth of experiences. Wennstrom at various times fasted, experienced the sublime joys of sharing special moments with neighborhood children, and faced potential muggers with loving kindness... to receive loving kindness in return. THE INSPIRED HEART shows us how, &quot;Enlightenment is not a grand finale that leaves us blissfully risen, Buddha-like, above the suffering of the world. It is a deep and unconditional surrender to what already exists and total trust in the larger inherent intelligence, which is willing to lead the way.&quot;<br />I love the color pictures of Wennstrom's art in the middle of this book, and the way Wennstrom's autobiographical short stories weave themselves in dreamy fashion through the places and times of his fascinating life.

From this slightly controversial assertion arises the basis for a most fascinating inside view of the topics of reincarnation, Edgar Cayce, David Wilcock, ascension, and the Law of One. THE REINCARNATION OF EDGAR CAYCE provides a careful overview of the consciousness work of David Wilcock.Many of David Wilcock's writings and channelings are included, as is information pertaining to the Egyptian sun-God, Ra.<br />Author Wynn Free does an excellent job of detailing Cayce's and Wilcock's various personal idiosyncracies, while slowly building a case that Wilcock is the reincarnation of Edgar Cayce. The significance of this work is that it asks readers to keep open minds while considering the deeper implications of reincarnation, specifically Edgar Cayce's reincarnation. When we visualize how Edgar Cayce would come back (as he once said he would), would he be concerned with helping mankind deepen our understanding of our higher self? Most likely so. Would he be personally involved in providing as much information as freely as possible? Probably yes.<br />Whether or not you believe David Wilcock is the reincarnation of Edgar Cayce, you'll love THE REINCARNATION OF EDGAR CAYCE for it's in-depth summary of scientific evidence supporting the theory of ascension, it's meticulous examination of Cayce and Wilcock, and it's explanation of what's happening next with Earth changes as we approach the predicted time of great transition.

While extensive training in psychotherapy sessions had offered useful insights, Geoffrey noted that progress had been slow... especially compared with the rapid improvement possible through an alternative method of finding self-sabotaging beliefs through Kinesiological (muscle) testing.<br />Old traumas have the power to become negative beliefs about ourselves, so there is tremendous relief when we learn how to begin expressing long-suppressed thoughts and feelings. WHEN YOU REACH THE END OF YOUR ROPE... LET GO! provides a a very simple Kinesiological self-test which can be used with a self-testing outline to guide you through your self-healing treatment. If you'd prefer a different method, Rose offers two more: a Chinese Five-Element review, and a basic life category approach.<br />WHEN YOU REACH THE END OF YOUR ROPE...

Facing criticism from both religious zealots and skeptics, the father-son research team nevertheless managed to live their dream of making significant contributions toward a better understanding of how prayer works.  A detailed appendix contains highlights from decades of Spindrift laboratory experiments into goal-directed and non-goal-directed prayer, and is a wonderful starting point for readers wishing to know how their research was conducted.<br />Spindrift experimented with people praying for yeast cells, mung beans, and other living organisms by observing how these organisms were benefited by prayer. The Spindrift research was interpreted by some to be evil, and the Klingbeils were ostracized and ridiculed for daring to scientifically show effects of prayer in the laboratory. A JOURNEY INTO PRAYER looks at the hardships the Klingbeils faced as they continued their prayer research even when their church began the excommunication process, and all the way up to their last days of life, just prior to their suicides. Why would Bruce and John kill themselves when they were just about to enjoy some well-deserved time off? This question and others related to their mysterious deaths are left to the reader to contemplate, following a detailed description of the days and weeks preceding the suicides.<br />What I love most about reading A JOURNEY INTO PRAYER is feeling a sense of being intimately involved in the lives of Bruce and John Klingbeil as they threw themselves fully into their prayer research, even when people misunderstood and misjudged them. A JOURNEY INTO PRAYER is a must read for anyone interested in an unflinching description of the high cost and high value of prayer research -- or who'd enjoy reading a real-life version of the Spiritual X-Files.<br />-- Cynthia Sue Larson, author of &quot;AURA ADVANTAGE: How the Colors in Your Aura Can Help You Attain What You Desire and Attract Success&quot;Colors in Your Aura Can Help You Attain What You Desire and Attract Success&quot;	2004-04-16

Author PMH Atwater points out that while there are many types of near-death experiences, there is one identifiable pattern that fits them all... and this pattern sets the stage for great changes in the child's life. Atwater further explains how children born recently, the \\"new children,\\" are demonstrating many of the same characteristics of children who have had NDEs. Many of these children view future events before they happen, learn at a very fast pace, are quick to recognize relationships, see ambiguity in what appears to be factual information, think abstractly, enjoy working independently, and don't want their giftedness pointed out.<br />Atwater shares her decades of NDE experience and research in such an engaging fashion that I became completely absorbed in the stories of these amazing children and their families.  In addition to sharing detailed personal accounts, Atwater provides helpful tips for parents of these gifted children who are often deeply concerned that their children be more \\"normal.\\" These children need an open, supportive environment, and can benefit from revisiting and documenting their experiences.<br />I highly recommend THE NEW CHILDREN AND NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES to anyone interested in better understanding today's new children, and catching a glimpse of how this next generation will change the world!<br />-- Cynthia Sue Larson<br />author of \\"AURA ADVANTAGE: How the Colors in Your Aura Can Help You Attain What You Desire and Attract Success\\" (Adams Media 2004)	2004-03-08

The prayer practices of many faiths are touched upon and presented with great compassion, from the metta blessing in Buddhism, to body-talking shamanism, to Reiki, to prayer with Jesus, to Jewish mystical ascension... and much more.<br />PRAYING FOR OTHERS is truly a smorgasbord of prayer, from which the reader may sample exotic prayer treats from around the world as well as more familiar approaches to connecting with divine healing energy. Heartfelt real-life prayer stories are included throughout, which gives the book a warm feeling of comfort and non-judgment. There are pitfalls to prayer, as anyone knows who's ever succumbed to feeling called to over-vigilance in praying for anyone and everything who needs help, or who's suffered a great loss and wondered why prayer failed this time. Walsh lovingly embraces all these experiences and more, sharing gentle wisdom in such a way that we too, may find grace in even our darkest hours.<br />The end result of reading PRAYING FOR OTHERS is nothing short of miraculous, as one discovers that by simply reading this book, one has received the many blessings of prayer.<br />-- Cynthia Sue Larson, author of \\"AURA ADVANTAGE: How the Colors in Your Aura Can Help You Attain What You Desire and Attract Success\\"	2004-03-05

Cleve Backster's research into the concept of &quot;primary perception,&quot; the way in which even the smallest living organisms demonstrate real-time reactions to their environments, will completely transform the way you think about consciousness of cells, plants, and living foods. Not only do your potted plants know precisely the moment you might spontaneously decide to return home, but they also know when living organisms (such as bacteria in your sink) are suddenly killed in their vicinity. Your own human cells that have been separated from your body and monitored will show immediate reactions to strong stimuli that you are exposed to -- even when they are located in a screen cage about fifteen feet away from you!<br />Cleve Backster is my favorite kind of scientist -- rich in imagination, full of questions, and ever-prepared to take note of the unexpected. These rare and dynamic qualities establish Backster as the most likely candidate for the &quot;Father of Biocommunication&quot; title, as he so clearly leads the way for future scientists to reevaluate their assumptions and methods for studying all living things.<br />PRIMARY PERCEPTION is destined to become a beloved classic because it so clearly describes Cleve Backster's nearly four decades of meticulous cutting-edge research in the field of consciousness research. Written in down-to-Earth language and packed with fascinating photographs and charts, PRIMARY PERCEPTION is guaranteed to alter your perception for good!<br />-- Cynthia Sue Larson, author of &quot;AURA ADVANTAGE: How the Colors in Your Aura Can Help You Attain What You Desire and Attract Success&quot;	2004-02-08

Cautiously skeptical at first, Fry was hesitant to be hypnotized by Clark. Once she felt the healing power of hypnosis in her life and recalled some very realistic past lives, Fry found her life and world-view completely transformed as she delved ever deeper into the mysterious realm of reincarnation.<br />QUEST FOR TRUTH reads like letters from a dear friend who shares her sense of wonder and excitement as each new spiritual discovery unfolds.

While many coaches and therapists advocate acceptance as being the key to overcoming destructive inner negative self-talk, few have so clearly delineated a method for people to achieve this healing state of being.<br />Katie's premise is that your beliefs are what cause you the most pain and suffering, and that by carefully reviewing those beliefs, you can more easily differentiate the things you can change from those you must learn to accept as they are. LOVING WHAT IS describes a simple technique for reviewing and revising your beliefs with a four-question technique that cuts to the core of what is really troubling you.<br />Like a wise grandmother, Katie shows how she lovingly soothes those she assists in transcripts of sessions in which she helps people take a look at whether their beliefs are true... whether they can absolutely know that those beliefs are true... how they react when they think those thoughts... and who they would be if they didn't believe those thoughts.<br />While emotions such as fear and anger may take time to transform into peace and joy, LOVING WHAT IS provides an excellent road-map to a more peaceful and enjoyable life for anyone who is ready to chart a new course.<br />Cynthia Sue Larson<br />-- author of &quot;Aura Advantage: How the Colors in Your Aura Can Help You Attain What You Desire and Attract Success&quot;	2003-11-19

For years, the general public has looked askance at individuals with anomalous sensitivities, often labeling them &quot;crazy,&quot; since normal people don't see ghosts or spirits, talk to trees, recall past lives, or claim to influence the world with psychokinesis. Psychologists examining such sensitives using traditional diagnostic guidebooks, such as the DSM, have often been confused when they've found these individuals are often diagnosable with eight or more simultaneous valid psychological and medical conditions! Clearly there is something more going on than traditional psychology has understood.<br />David Ritchey's THE HISS OF THE ASP covers ten years of scientific research and fifteen years of clinical psychological insights, as it describes how many of the sensitivities of the Anomalously Sensitive Person (ASP) can be objectively measured on a Holistic Inventory of Stimulus Sensitivities (HISS). The HISS test can be administered to determine what kind of sensitivity a person has, and is included along with detailed analyses of the variables being studied. While THE HISS OF THE ASP is packed with details about interpreting test scores, it keeps the reader awake with amusing anecdotes and entertaining cartoons and quotes throughout.<br />THE HISS OF THE ASP will clearly be required reading for all serious students of psychology, as it clarifies centuries of confusion on the subject of how best to understand and support anomalously sensitive individuals.<br />-- Cynthia Sue Larson<br />author of AURA ADVANTAGE: How the Colors in Your Aura Can Help You Attain What You Desire and Attract Success	2003-10-26

This riveting account of daily life in Nazi Germany is as surprising as it is engaging, and held me firmly in its spell until I reached the very last page.<br />I watched the main characters of ONLY ONE TEAR MAY FALL in awe, shock, and admiration as they found various ways to cope with the horrific situation all around them. When growing up in Hitler's Nazi Germany, men destined to become military generals and SS officers were raised to know that in their lifetime, only one tear may fall. This harsh expectation had a way of hardening some men, while others managed to find ways to be compassionate in spite of seemingly overwhelming circumstances.<br />While wartime atrocities are only hinted at in ONLY ONE TEAR MAY FALL, its main focus is how it was possible for men and women to maintain a sense of home and family at a time when most German families were being torn apart. At a time when life could end any minute, living in the moment became a way of life. While some men and women chose to live those precious minutes with wild abandon, others found deeper meaning... and even true love.<br />ONLY ONE TEAR MAY FALL is a story that stays with you long after you read it, because of its haunting imagery, suspenseful plot, captivating characters, and timeless relevance.

Joseph Ernest Martin demonstrates his creative, playful side by including several games to play with this deck -- everything from &quot;Quest Tarot Poker&quot; to &quot;Truth or Dare!&quot; My other favorite thing about the companion book is how clearly Martin describes techniques for getting the most insight from each of your readings -- &quot;turbo-charging&quot; them so they provide you with the most awesome insights.<br />If you've got burning questions, THE QUEST TAROT has the answers for you!	2003-09-11

While reading QUANTUM-TOUCH, I discovered that Gordon does not explain why he calls his healing technique \\"quantum\\" touch, nor does he provide more than the briefest discussion about scientific research into quantum phenomena.<br />What Gordon does do, and does very well, is describe how almost anyone with genuine interest and dedication can see amazing healing results by learning some very simple energy techniques. I especially love the illustrations, and Richard Gordon's friendly approach to enjoying the healing experience. Packed with entertaining stories and clear descriptions of how to do a variety of healing exercises, QUANTUM-TOUCH provides the reader with sufficient tools to embark upon a first-rate healing adventure.<br />QUANTUM-TOUCH provides a thrilling introduction to the world of QiGong, without ever mentioning QiGong. QiGong literally means \\"breath work,\\" or \\"energy work,\\" and that's precisely what Quantum-Touch is all about.	2003-08-12

Disillusioned to discover that traditional medical doctors offered only the vaguest assurances that her breast cancer would probably not recur, Johnson felt inspired to seek out healers who consider all aspects of an individual (not just the physical) when they heal. Beginning with tips Johnson received from the Native Americans she'd interviewed for her previous book, Johnson discovered a wonderfully diverse group of healers working with shamanic soul retrieval, alchemy, intuition, yoga, Kahuna, Australian Aboriginal, chiropractic, water, musical, and psychic surgery methods.<br />THE BRAZILIAN HEALER WITH THE KITCHEN KNIFE is so fascinating and well-written that I found it impossible to set down, as Johnson devoted a chapter to each of sixteen gifted healers. Here are healers who can see inside peoples' physical and energy bodies with ease -- at times performing miraculous healings. Photos are shown of most of the healers, including one woman healer who comes out of her healing trances to find gold-like metal flakes on her body, an Aboriginal man who works with \\"love, light, crystals, and energy,\\" and men who remove cancerous lumps and cataracts from their patients -- often with nothing more than a kitchen knife.<br />Johnson's open-minded skepticism is refreshing; even as she feels certain she's gone \\"down the rabbit hole,\\" she retains her journalistic common sense and composure to ask these healers how they heal. The healers Sandy Johnson visited include: Sandra Ingerman, Katie Engelhart, Howard Wills, Vianna Stibal, Virginia Ellen, Milton Trager, Gary Brownlee, Auntie Margaret, Warren Barigian, Gerry Bostock, Dr. Ruth Ziemba, Peter Maxwel, Rubens Faria, and John of God.<br />Whether you are considering enlisting aid from a holistic healer, or are just curious to read stories that prove truth is stranger than fiction -- THE BRAZILIAN HEALER WITH THE KITCHEN KNIFE will satisfy and delight.

How do we handle all the conflicting advice we hear from experts -- and how do we help our children be both respectful and joyful?<br />Julie Moss Scandora's book, ONE IN A MILLION gets right to the heart of these issues, with wonderful insights that spring directly from personal experience backed up with thorough research. Whether you need help figuring out ways to help your children treat you and others with more respect, or simply wonder how to help your children know they matter in your life -- this is an awesome book! It truly lives up to its subtitle: \\"Bringing out what is wondrous in your child through trust, understanding, and respect.\\" Yes, you really can guide your child, and feel good about your methods!<br />I love the way Scandora doesn't gloss over the really tricky areas of parenting (such as what do you do when your child has been lying and stealing for some time). I also love the way her respect for both parents and children shines through on every page.<br />Seldom does a parenting book have such warmth, wisdom, and genuine compassion in its pages.

Seldom has a book elicited such deep emotional response and spiritual longing as does this fast-paced adventure through the jungles and back roads of Peru. Nine key insights into the meaning of life are revealed one at a time as the story unfolds, with each one's meaning made clear in the context of the story.<br />This multi-dimensional book is rewarding on many levels. It tells a tale of adventure, it presents ideas that have the power to reshape one's life, and it transports readers to a higher state of awareness. From considering the significance of increasingly common coincidences and synchronicities (the first insight), to perceiving what had previously been considered an invisible form of energy (the second insight), all the way to the understanding that our increased perception and vibration will open us to directly experiencing a Heaven that is already before us (the ninth insight), this book keeps readers hungry for more.<br />-- Cynthia Sue Larson, author of KAREN KIMBALL &amp; the Dream Weaver's Web, and editor of RealityShifters News ezine.	2003-06-26

This \\"Zero Point Field\\" provides us with a simpler explanation for how things work than previous overly-complex ideas require. Simplicity in science is a good thing, because it generally indicates which theories will win out as time goes by. The Zero Point Field theory demonstrates it's elegant simplicity by allowing physicists to derive the famous equation F=ma (rather than take it as a starting assumption), and by helping medical practitioners understand the underlying scientific basis for homeopathy.<br /><br />Our scientific conceptualization of this universe has changed considerably over the last few centuries and now faces one of the biggest overhauls ever -- and THE FIELD demonstrates why the Zero Point Field is likely to be the last frontier for us to explore. THE FIELD is packed with detailed descriptions of some of the most exciting experiments recently conducted by leading researchers in the field of consciousness such as: Cleve Backster, Jacques Benveniste, William Braud, Bob Jahn, Edgar Mitchell, Fritz-Albert Popp, Hal Puthoff, Rupert Sheldrake, Russell Targ, Elisabeth Targ, and Charles Tart.<br /><br />I give this book my highest recommendation.<br /><br />(Cynthia Sue Larson has a degree in physics from UC Berkeley and is author of the book \\"AURA ADVANTAGE: How the Colors in Your Aura Can Help You Attain What You Desire & Attact Success\\")	2003-06-11

Neurobiologist Deena Spear writes with candor and self-effacing humor in EARS OF THE ANGELS about how energy work can heal and transform violins,  violas, cellos... and human beings. Spear's fascinating, detailed descriptions of violin enhancement began with physical techniques (such as tapping, blowing, and scraping), and moved into non-physical, hands-on and long-distance energetic techniques.<br />What sets EARS OF THE ANGELS apart from most other energetic healing books is the way it describes energetic acoustic principles that can heal both stringed instruments such as violins, and sentient beings such as humans. Spear includes delightful real-life stories from clients whose instruments have been tuned (and sometimes even glued) long-distance without any direct physical contact from Spear that clearly attest to the efficacy of her methods. She describes how her energy tuning work has helped pets become cancer-free, people become toxin-free, and significantly improved relationships.<br />Anyone interested in enhancing the sound of stringed instruments will find EARS OF THE ANGELS essential reading, as will everyone who wishes to discover more about the kinds of physical changes that are possible through conscious intention and energy field work.

While growing up in a small town in Arizona has both good and bad points, it lends a very special atmosphere to this exceptionally sweet love story.

Even so, the romance shared by these two young lovers eventually proves its power for transcending all obstacles -- even death. \\"Unforgettable\\" may well have you crying tears of release by the end of the book, as it did for me.

We finally have a book that's dedicated to covering the newly emerging category of spiritual cinema! THE FORCE IS WITH YOU is written by Hollywood insider Stephen Simon, who writes straight from his heart about the significant messages in more than 70 movies. Spiritual Cinema is all about exploring the meaning of love, life, death, time, and space -- which are the topics I most enjoy seeing in the movies. Most of my favorite movies are included here: The Matrix, Sliding Doors, Somewhere in Time, The Kid, Frequency, Star Wars, Lost Horizon, The Sixth Sense, Ghost, What Dreams May Come, Defending Your Life, Groundhog Day, Contact, Phenomenon, Powder, Being There, The Truman Show, Sleepless in Seattle, Family Man, and It's A Wonderful Life.<br />What I love best about THE FORCE IS WITH YOU is the way it so clearly conveys a sense of hope, inspiration, and purposefulness about the way humanity learns about its worst fears and greatest hopes through stories. Yes, we love to vividly imagine the end of the world... but we also love to dream of ways we can find solutions to our biggest problems. We know that it's not easy being more spiritually and psychically evolved... but we love to imagine how those of us who are different can be accepted in mainstream society.<br />THE FORCE IS WITH YOU is priceless for clarifying what the new genre of  \\"Spiritual Cinema\\" is all about, and for providing an inspiring list of the most spiritual movies of all time. It is my deepest hope that this book will help establish awareness in film-makers everywhere of the importance of making spiritual movies, as it helps movie-goers better understand the significance of the movies they see.	2003-04-13

Because he believed it was possible to recover his health and he never gave up a regular exercise program, he was able to shock his doctors one day by wiggling his fingers!<br />While he has not yet freed himself from his wheelchair, the very fact that Reeve is regaining motor control below his neck provides hope to people everywhere. I was profoundly moved by NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE, because Reeve so clearly conveys the importance of cultivating compassion; when we feel and respond to the needs of others, there is hope for us all.

In &quot;Finding True Love,&quot; Kingma shares wisdom gleaned from her 25 year career as a therapist, providing encouragement and inspiration for even the most lovelorn among us.<br />Kingma shows that there is a &quot;path to love,&quot; and that you are already on it. When you open yourself with a sense of faith and know that love awaits you, and make yourself available for love... you have begun your journey. Your next step is to set your intention for love, which means you will need to know who you really are, discover why love has apparently eluded you so far, and develop your capacity for love. Once you've set your intentions, you need to restore a sense of trust in love. This trust involves being realistic about what love actually is at the same time that you recognize the higher (spiritual) purpose of relationships, and appreciate the wisdom of spirit in creating relationships for you. Finally, you need to master the art of surrender to love -- and Kingma explains how this involves letting go of your preconceptions about what love is and isn't at the same time as you leap into the unknown with a sense of gratitude and appreciation for the paradox of love.<br />Kingma is a master at helping us unconditionally love ourselves at the same time as we learn to trust spirit and love -- even when our hearts may have been broken so many times before. She shares touching stories that illustrate her points, and offers a glimpse of what love can be, if only we learn to allow it fully into our lives.<br />This book can change your life forever.

It shines like a star in the night, guiding us to a new and much improved view of ourselves and our relationship histories. With compassionate words and crystal-clear logic, Kingma explains why failure in love is actually impossible -- because love is who you are. Every relationship you have ever had has been part of your life for a very good reason, and when you step back and examine your life with compassionate eyes, you can see (perhaps for the first time) how perfectly orchestrated everything has actually been.<br />As Kingma writes, &quot;We stretch, and to our amazement we don't break. Instead, we grow. Suddenly, everything becomes easier, and our hearts, which once we believed could love only one person, or were battered so badly we thought they could never love again, expand so fully that the whole world is welcome.&quot;<br />This spiritual book can provide amazing insights for you, regardless which of the seven stages of love you may currently find yourself in (Romance, Commitment, Crisis, Ordeal, Chaos, Surrender, Transformation). One thing is certain after you've read this book -- your view of the meaning of love will be permanently transformed.	2003-02-02

Tisserand provides basic tips and pointers for those who are new to working with essential oils, and also explains which scents are most useful for which effects. Even if you don't have a lover to massage with heavenly-scented oils, you can benefit from bringing scents into your daily life. Luxuriate in scented baths, and savor the pleasure of a well-scented home.<br />If you are really getting into the art of blending essential oils, Tisserand provides a number of wonderful recipes that can help you with various skin and hair care issues, or simply improve how you feel (emotionally). I was surprised to learn that jojoba oil can emulsify fats in the deeper layers of the skin, so the body can more easily get rid of them -- and that lemongrass oil can fight and eliminate infection in the connective tissues of the body.<br />This book is a wonderful reference book, as well as being packed with information that will both inspire and amaze you. I found Tisserand's list of scentual facts to be especially fascinating... it includes such tantalizing tidbits as, &quot;Female hormones can be diffused across a room, but male pheromenes can only be transferred by intimate contact.&quot;	2003-02-02

The twenty-two cards included in this deck are known as the Major Arcana, or the face-cards, of the tarot. A sturdy box holds both the book and cards so they can easily be stored and transported. The slender book that accompanies these cards whets the reader's appetite to learn more, while providing only the most basic interpretation of the significance of the card. Because the book does not provide tremendous detail on the meaning of the cards, this deck is better suited for people who are already somewhat familiar with the reading tarot cards.	2003-02-02

Written by a spiritual scientist who believes in the wisdom of consciously working in collaboration with God, this excellent book provides you with tools you can use right now to find your best possible life path. When you learn the art of unfolding, you will remember how to be who you are, discover your purpose, develop your partnership with God, choose your soul's path, share your soul's gifts with others, and create healing in the world.<br />Julia Mossbridge is an award-winning neuroscientist who was inspired to become a life coach when she felt a need to find a more fulfilling life for herself. She knew that there was a lot of untapped potential inside of her, and when she set out to discover how to rebuild her life around who she really was, she was amazed at how much better that felt! UNFOLDING describes the process Mossbridge successfully teaches and uses to do the inner work required for living an outwardly successful life. Each section contains wonderful exercises that will help you see immediate results.<br />UNFOLDING is a friendly book that stimulates my imagination and delights my intellect, and I love it so much that I've been carrying it with me everywhere I go. I especially like the sections on &quot;Creating Goal Communities,&quot; &quot;Recognizing Splintered Paths,&quot; and the &quot;Fear-Facing Practice.&quot; Another unexpected gem in this book is Mossbridge's amazingly clear explanation of how to integrate the seemingly opposite and unreconcilable philosophies of &quot;Let Go, Let God,&quot; and &quot;100 Percent Responsibility&quot; when you create your partnership with God.

People (especially children and psychic/sensitives) will likely find themselves instantly attracted to this deck because of the feeling of purity its illustrations are imbued with. <br />Colorful and cartoonlike, each card's illustration still manages to convey even the most somber of moods, such as the lifeless solemnity of the knight's effigy resting atop a marble tomb on the Four of Swords. Other cards, such as Temperence and The Star shine with such radiance that one feels uplifted just to gaze upon their beauty.<br />This is a Tarot deck to cherish forever as both a work of art and a divination tool to share with others -- especially those with sensitive natures.	2003-01-18

Chris Van Allsburg's book, THE SWEETEST FIG, is an exquisitely illustrated book that raises the fascinating question, \\"What if... when you slept, your dreams came true?\\"<br />This story tells the tale of a mean-spirited dentist, Monsieur Bibot, who lives in Paris, France, with only his small, white dog for a companion. When Bibot receives as payment two small figs from an old woman who can't afford to pay him for his dental services, he is furious. The woman tells Bibot that these figs are special... \\"they can make your dreams come true.\\" Dreams are clearly something that Bibot cares little for... that is, until he discovers that the old woman was telling him the truth. When he finds himself standing outside a restaurant dressed only in his underwear, and the Eiffel Tower bending down as if it were made of rubber -- he rushes home and begins practicing the art of controlling his dreams. Bibot's attempt to overly-control his life takes a surprising turn, and this story vividly illustrates the point that greed and self-absorption can ruin a man's life.<br />Because the artwork in this book is so exceptionally good and the moral of the story is so delightful, this is one book that parents will love to read to their children again and again!	2003-01-18

The beautifully designed cards give one an immediate sense of the wonder of entering the fairy realm, and are truly stunning to behold. THE FAIRY RING book provides enchanting stories of each character that explain the divinatory message imparted in every card reading. I particularly enjoyed reading the story about Queen Oonaugh, where she cleverly helps Fin MacCool avoid a fight with a giant called Cucullin by recommending that Fin pretend to be his own baby when the giant shows up at his home.<br />In addition to a court of thirteen fairies representing each season (with a Lady, Knave, King, Queen, and Ace), there are eight fairy festival cards (Imbolc, Ostara, Beltane, Midsummer, Lughnasa, Herfest, Samhain, and Yule). It's easy to sense at a glance which fairies are good to work with and which are not, since each card conveys through use of color, expression, and lighting the feelings being described. THE FAIRY RING book further clarifies which fairies are helpful and provides advice regarding how best to obtain help from them (such as Habetrot, Asrai, the Sea Mither, Brownies and Leprechauns), and which fairies are best avoided because they are known for being treacherous, illusory, or inaccessible (such as the Changeling, Will o' the Wisp, or Jenny Greenteeth). For those who need a little help asking the fairies for guidance, nine different divinatory spreads are provided, along with a sample reading for the Fairy Market spread.<br />If you already feel an affinity for fairies and are willing to read through the stories and divinatory meanings for each card, this deck will quickly become an invaluable aid. I received meaningful guidance and advice from THE FAIRY RING deck after using it twice!	2003-01-17

There is a colorful aura of joy around Emily as she paints with her heart, and she radiates a soft, pink glow when she paints a watercolor picture of her friend, Kelly. When Emily's class participates in a school-wide art contest, Emily chooses to enter a picture of her dog, Thor, with great big ears, \\"Because Thor hears everything.\\" When all the first-grade pictures are judged in the art contest, Emily is heart-broken to see her beloved picture of Thor passed over because the judge hates dogs. Fortunately, Emily's friend, Kelly, and her teacher, Ms. Fair, show Emily how much they care about her, and the story ends with a class party to celebrate all the beautiful pictures the children made.<br />What makes this picture book so very special is the way that every illustration of Emily shows how she feels in body posture, facial expression, and her human energy field. When Emily is happy, soft colors of light shine around her head and shoulders. When Emily is sad, her head droops forward and she becomes transparent as her aura disappears. Every picture of her aura is delightfully different -- my favorite is the one where she is showing her friend, Kelly, how to draw a dinosaur and lots of bright colors surround her head, back, and arm!<br />This is a gorgeous watercolor picture book that shows how feelings look in the human energy field.

As scientists increasingly recognize how living organisms consist of dynamic energy systems based on familiar kinds of physical field phenomena, we can all begin to see that \\"vibrational therapies are not magic or superstition: they are based on biology, chemistry, and physics.\\"<br /><br />Oschman guides the reader through a delightful series of beautifully-illustrated chapters that present well-organized pieces of a bridge between scientific information and complementary medicine. While western medical practioners have long been aware that rapid and spontaneous remissions occur for even the most potent cancers and the most catastrophic injuries, they have been slower to establish and evaluate workable explanations for how such healing can occur. ENERGY MEDICINE thoroughly examines the most current scientific theories and experimental findings to describe how a wide variety of complementary medical treatments operate within the realm of what we know to be true.<br /><br />I hope that ENERGY MEDICINE will be required reading in schools the world over, because it presents scientific research without side-stepping around the most interesting aspects of healing (such as spontaneous remissions). When you read ENERGY MEDICINE, you'll learn how: our cells and tissues are crystalline molecular arrays that act as coherent antennas, humans respond to the Schumann oscillations around the Earth, a mechanism for entrainment operates between the Earth and humans, and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) can be used to detect biomagnetic fields around the human body. You'll also discover a wealth of fascinating facts, such as how the ventricle of the heart is formed of a single band of muscle wrapped in a double-helix in such a way that the heart's rhythmic beatings resonate with the more rapid oscillations of DNA.<br /><br />ENERGY MEDICINE is a must for anyone who desires a more complete understanding of the scientific basis for complementary and alternative medicine.<br /><br />-- Cynthia Sue Larson<br /><br />author of \\"AURA ADVANTAGE: How the Colors in Your Aura Can Help You Attain What You Desire and Attract Success\\"for anyone who desires a more complete understanding of the scientific basis for complementary and alternative medicine.    -- Cynthia Sue Larson    author of \\"AURA ADVANTAGE: How the Colors in Your Aura Can Help You Attain What You Desire and Attract Success\\"	2003-01-14

While artistic inspiration can come from many sources (music, fasting, prayer, meditation, romantic love), Francine Prose's book examines the romantic kind of artistic inspiration which arises between men and women -- with men typically playing the role of artist to the woman's role of muse.<br />And who, exactly, is a muse? Francine Prose writes, \\"The muse is often that person with whom the artist has the animated imaginary conversations, the interior dialogues we all conduct, most commonly with someone we cannot get out of our minds.\\" Francine Prose delves into some of the most intimate details of the muses' and artists' sexual lives, yet never loses touch with the vision of her book as a guidepost to better understanding the art of being a muse. While muses are chosen by artists, and therefore seemingly have no ability to chart muse-dom as a career path for themselves, they appear to share certain qualities with one another. For one thing, many muses have been intensely disliked by their contemporaries -- perhaps because people can intuitively sense that there is an unusually strong bond of love between an artist and his muse.<br />If the subject of this book at times makes one feel uncomfortable, that is no doubt due to the fact that the interaction between artists and muses take people to the very greatest emotional heights and depths. The passions felt between artists and their muses are so tremendous that they sometimes provoke people's behavior to go completely out-of-control... yet these same passions present artists with some of their greatest sources of inspiration. Francine Prose's extraordinary book, THE LIVES OF THE MUSES, shows us a unique vision of how artists' lives are shaped and driven by the love and inspiration of their muses. It is the gift of the muse to offer her artist \\"that rare and precious spark ignited by genius and passion.\\"n by the love and inspiration of their muses.

Saint Teresa shines forth as a fascinating historical figure in TERESA OF AVILA: THE PROGRESS OF A SOUL because she seemed to have an innate ability to continually seek the highest possible spiritual path throughout her life. Whenever temptation arose, she was willing to do whatever might be necessary to right herself again -- regardless whether the form of temptation or evil took human or supernatural form.<br />Medwick maintains a detached tone throughout this riveting story, which provides one with a better idea of what it was like to live in Saint Teresa's time (with the Inquisition wreaking havoc in the lives of some spiritual people). Descriptions of how Teresa must have felt as she experienced amazing spiritual epiphanies are handled with grace and aplomb by Medwick, who shares the facts without ever stooping to speculation nor overly exalting Teresa.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to better understand what life was like for a spiritual woman in 16th century Europe whose utmost desire was to be as close to God as possible.	2002-12-13

Uri traces the cause of these unusual powers back to a very strange incident when he was just three or four years old, playing in an Arabic garden near his childhood home in Tel Aviv, and encountered a spacecraft which blocked out the sun with its own intense light.<br />Thanks to caring teachers, friends, and family members, Uri's talents for knowing what people were thinking and doing all kinds of psychokinetic &quot;tricks&quot; were understood to be very real, if also quite inexplicable. Scientists from around the world such as Edgar Mitchell, Russell Targ, and David Bohm studied Uri Geller, and through a series of rigorously scientific tests, proved to their own satisfaction that these phenomena were indeed repeatable and not the result of trickery.<br />I am especially interested in the phenomena described in Uri's first-hand account, because it so closely matches things I have experienced in my life.

THE ROOTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS was written by the world's one and only doctor in parapsychology, Dr. Jeffrey Mishlove. Few people are as well-connected with pioneers in the field of conciousness as Mishlove, and his lifetime of experience with psychic research is reflected in what is certainly the most complete compendium of consciousness studies ever.<br />Have you ever wondered whether people's feelings towards one another could be captured on film, or whether animals can communicate with humans? Would you like to better understand metal-bending, psychokinesis, UFOs and out-of-body phenomenons? If you answered, &quot;yes&quot; to any of the above, this is the book for you.<br />THE ROOTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS is large (wide, thick and heavy), with lots of excellent black and white photographs and illustrations, which makes it an ideal conversation-starter when placed atop your coffee table. By flipping this book open randomly to any given page, one is immediately rewarded with fascinating insights into the details of some branch of parapsychology. Mishlove's interdisciplinary expertise lends this book tremendous depth and breadth of scope, as it includes history, mathematics, physics, psychology, and religion.<br />I love the way this book is organized into several main sections which cover history, folklore, scientific studies, and theories to explain what is going on when people demonstrate extraordinary events and human abilities.

The research described in INFINITE MIND is on the cutting edge of exploring what we know about human energy fields. Hunt's descriptions of experiments she's conducted with aura readers and physicists make fascinating reading. For example, Hunt shares her amazing findings in the &quot;Mu Room,&quot; in which human subjects burst into tears when the electromagnetism of the air was depleted, and regained a sense of clear thinking when the electromagnetism of the air was increased. The Mu Room is a seven foot square shielded room located in the Physics department at UCLA, where the electromagnetic energy of the air can be altered without reducing its breathability (oxygen content). Other studies examine the energy fields of healers and the people they are healing, and the energy fields eminating from our bodies independent from our internal organs.<br />INFINITE MIND is packed with gems of wisdom, such as Hunt's description of the five most commonly unintegrated spiritual experiences (experiencing a God-like energy, recalling a past life, gaining abilities to perform miraculous healings and alter material substances, acknowledging one's rage at God's apparent abandonment of us, and the Kundalini experience). INFINITE MIND is a book best read sequentially from beginning to end, since Hunt includes numerous personal experiences throughout her descriptions of scientific studies and experimental results.<br />What I most enjoy about INFINITE MIND is the way Hunt weaves together a sense of wholeness from her exotic experiences with spirit healing in foreign lands, her unceasing commitment to scientifically investigating energy fields and thought forms, and her honesty in sharing her mystical insights along the way. Seldom is a reference book as riveting and relevant as INFINITE MIND. I give it my highest recommendation!	2002-12-04

Your energy field can serve to uplift those around you, or it can have the opposite effect and tend to weaken those you encounter. Since most people are unaware of these energy fields and their significance in bringing about miraculous changes in the world, they do not realize how they can measurably raise their consciousness, and see the world more clearly as it truly is.<br />POWER VS FORCE helps to solve the problems of confusion and negative patterns of behavior by presenting a crystal-clear model of consciousness along with a useful tool for measuring the energy levels of fields of consciousness around us. Hawkins describes how we can measure the frequencies of the fields surrounding people, ideas, and things with Kinesiology, sometimes referred to as &quot;muscle testing.&quot; When we ask questions about things that we consciously do not know the answers to, we can find out the truth that is known to the collective unconscious. As author David Hawkins explains, &quot;Everything in the universe constantly gives off an energy pattern of a specific frequency that remains for all time and can be read by those who know how. Every word, deed, and intention creates a permanent record. Every thought is known and recorded forever. There are no secrets; nothing is hidden, nor can it be.&quot;<br />The main idea in POWER VS FORCE is that when you raise the level of energy of your field, you will experience more joy and peace in your life, which in turn will help to improve the quality of life for everyone. You can learn to use Kinesiology to determine truth from falsehood, and to improve your life in every meaningful way.

Toms organizes these inspiring interviews into chapters that explore some of America's founding principles of democracy, freedom of the press, and national security. What makes A TIME FOR CHOICES really stand out as an exceptional book, however, is the fact that it also includes discussion of spiritual issues and hopeful visions of the future.<br />I love the way I learned things in A TIME FOR CHOICES that I have not heard of anywhere else. For example, International Law professor Francis Boyle explains why the United States is obliged to resolve its dispute with Afghanistan in a peaceful manner according to UN Charter 2(3) and Article 33, and linguist Noam Chomsky describes the importance of retaining civil liberties in America. Author and world-traveler Mark Hertsgaard shows how different American media is from international media, when for example President George Bush's statement, \\"You're for us or against us\\" made headlines in France, but was buried deep inside American news reports.<br />I highly recommend A TIME FOR CHOICES to everyone who wishes to see the big picture of what is really happening in America today. A TIME FOR CHOICES should be required reading for all Americans, and for anyone interested in understanding where America is headed next.	2002-12-02

Books	5	122	128	N	N	A Guidebook for Those Committed to Changing Beliefs	HAPPINESS IS FREE is one of those amazing books that you either take at face value as something that will change your life forever -- or discount as \\"too good to be true.\\" It's a credit to the author, Hale Dwoskin, that this book succeeds in convincing me that when one lives in accordance with the principles outlined in this small volume, one can reap phenomenal rewards.<br />HAPPINESS IS FREE is a seven week course based on the Sedona method teachings of Lester Levenson. Readers are advised to carefully follow the suggestions of the book to read slowly, practice using the new ideas, and document daily experiences in a journal in order to allow the seemingly simple lessons to take root in the unconscious. This book reminds you that you are already a joyous spiritual being who is totally loved and loving -- and that your key to happiness is to remember and fully access this truth!<br />The main principle described in HAPPINESS IS FREE is that true happiness comes from freeing oneself from the grips of one's ego. The bulk of the book is devoted to helping you do just that -- break free of the death-grip that your ego has on your life at this very moment. A diary of progress is included in this book, along with numerous aphorisms designed as affirmations of living a spiritual life and letting go of ego-fixations.<br />What I like best about HAPPINESS IS FREE is the way it describes what it feels like to live a spiritual life. I was very glad to read the experiences that Lester Levenson shares in the beginning of this book, such as the way people offered him everything he needed with great delight no matter where he went! Those who have difficulty believing that such things could happen will likely not enjoy this book as much as those who already know that such things are not only possible, but can become much more prevalent in one's life. I highly recommend this book to all spiritual seekers who are committed to changing their beliefs and radically improving their lives.es.	2002-11-17

Watkins' book, CURING HUMAN, provides penetrating insights into the reasons why ego-identification rarely turns out to be the yellow brick road to happiness it initially appears to be. Sure, the appeal of fancy clothes, cars, and other material trappings of success might seem to ensure long-lasting happiness on the surface, but rarely is the ego's promise of making people truly happy ever delivered. Watkins' investigation into the truth behind mankind's problems can seem acerbic at times as no sacred cow is left un-tipped, but the scathing critiques are an integral part of the author's intent to rouse readers out of their feelings of complacency.<br />My favorite part of CURING HUMAN is the section that outlines the differences between ego consciousness and higher consciousness. Watkins' clearly states her assertion that only when we transcend ego consciousness will we ever truly find satisfaction, happiness, and wholeness. While the ego leads us to feel empty and alone (what with all the manipulative games of deceit going on all around us), spirit provides us with the only true kind of satisfaction available. Watkins excels as describing in gory detail the myriad of trials and tribulations humans put ourselves through as we seek happiness, and how such attempts to lead non-spiritual lives typically lead down similar unhappy trails. If you've been feeling &quot;on the fence&quot; about getting more spiritual, this book may be just the thing to kick you into higher gear!<br />Members of organized religions may feel offended that Watkins' assessment of such spiritual organizations is primarily negative. CURING HUMAN will be most warmly welcomed by independent-thinkers and spiritual seekers who are interested in an in-depth expose of the pervasive cult of the ego flourishing in most western civilizations today -- and in suggestions about how we can become more spiritual.	2002-11-15

While these modern-day enlightenment gurus often shun media appearances, their mystique grows. Short of joining one of their organizations, it can be challenging to find out the basis for their teachings, and whether they might be helpful in guiding one to a sense of enlightenment and spiritual fulfillment in one's life. Berthold Madhukar Thompson presents riveting interviews with twelve such spiritual teachers of non-dualistic traditions in the story of his search for truth, THE ODYSSEY OF ENLIGHTENMENT.<br />Thompson finds and shares something truly amazing and unexpected in this book -- completely unique perspectives on how one can best find joy and a sense of eternal peace. I was surprised to find so many different definitions of enlightenment in one book, as well as some rather unexpected points of view on whether or how enlightenment should even be pursued as a goal. I was glad to see that a biographical profile and photograph of each of these special individuals is included at the beginning of each section, so I got a better sense of who they are. I found the diversity of perspectives to be quite refreshing, and know that this is a book I'll be glad to refer to whenever I want to see the world in fresh, new ways.<br />Thompson is a kind and trusty guide through an exploration of the essence of reality, consciousness, and oneness. Thanks to Thompson's thoughtful observations and willingness to share his own personal experiences, THE ODYSSEY OF ENLIGHTENMENT transcends potential confusion and presents the reader with a fascinating overview of the teachings of some of the world's pre-eminent enlightenment gurus of the 21st century. This book is bejeweled with insights that can help bring peace of mind, such as &quot;thought activity is the main hindrance to realization.&quot; In addition to sharing these gems of wisdom, this book also explains how to put them into practice in one's life.<br />Whether you are curious about what's really being taught in various schools of non-duality and enlightenment, or would like specific information about Osho, Papaji, Harish Madhukar, Gangaji, Annamalai Swami, Lakshmana Swami, Ramesh S.

You know magic is surely afoot when a 112 page book says more on the subject of Celtic mythology, gods and godesses, divination, and rituals than most of the larger books on this topic ever manage to convey. I am particularly impressed with Knight's immense knowledge on Celtic traditions, which are abundantly obvious to anyone fortunate enough to read this little gem of a reference book.<br />I especially loved reading about &quot;The Three Eyes of Kerridwen&quot;, which Knight explains is a formula for creating any pattern in magic. While it only consists of three basic steps, they are indeed the essence of all good manifestation.<br />This is the fun kind of book that's the perfect size to take with you when you travel to lands steeped in Celtic tradition -- or if you prefer, it's perfect for reading by the fire. You can then travel on the wings of your imagination to the British Isles thousands of years ago.	2002-10-24

My sister recommended this book to me, after she warned me, \\"It's a bit warped, because I dropped it in the bathtub when I was laughing so hard\\"!  ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY is a collection of David Sedaris' autobiographical short stories, which describe his childhood speech problems, his father's obsession with forming a jazz band with his progeny, his move to Paris with his boyfriend, and his attempts to master the art of speaking French while living in France.<br />I've been looking for years for an heir to James Thurber -- someone whose mastery of observation excels at describing everyday incidents without stripping away their intrinsically bizarre nature. I'm pleased to find this heir in David Sedaris, whose short stories are nakedly honest and touchingly fresh.  Sedaris shares things which most of us would not even write in our own private diaries, such as,  \\"Because I am both a glutton and a masochist, my standard complaint, 'That was so bad,' is always followed by 'And there was so little of it!'\\"<br />My favorite stories were \\"Jesus Shaves\\", in which Sedaris attempts to explain American Easter holiday traditions in broken French to many foreign students (and one sadistic teacher) in his French class, and \\"Giant Dreams, Midget Abilities\\", in which Sedaris takes guitar lessons from a midget as part of his father's dream of creating a family jazz band.<br />If you love humor that's as sublime as it is surreal, you'll love ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY.

Author Donald Schnell shares his extremely personal journey to India where he meets the immortal Babaji yogi, and describes what many would consider to be the indescribable. After all, how can one adequately convey the way the world looks when all illusion (maya) is stripped away? Yes, miracles are possible, but they are only \\"siddhis\\", or sacred gifts which are not the true essence of reality. Siddhis like manifestation, teleportation, and levitation are joyous to behold, but are not meant to distract us from seeing the miraculous nature of the universe which is present here right now.<br />Schnell not only describes the way the world looks when one feels the joy and bliss of divine awareness, but he does so in such a way that the feeling of this loving state of consciousness is bestowed upon the reader. I felt like I had received many blessings as I read this book, and I know my life will be ever the richer for it. Schnell describes many details of how it felt to undergo a very special kind of initiation from the moment when he felt suddenly called to India, to the wondrous miracles he encountered as he traveled across India, to the culmination of his trip in his initiation into the yogic order with his new yogic name, Prema Baba Swamiji. The accounts of his meetings with Babaji are a joy to read -- Babaji appears to still be in his early twenties, in spite of the fact that he's been teaching students for hundreds of years. He grants Schnell's request for a photograph of him by materializing one. He also materializes a very beautiful and sacred crystal, which is still molten-hot and malleable when it appears in Schnell's hands out of thin air.<br />While THE INITIATION is ostensibly an autobiographical account of one man's journey to enlightenment, this book is actually much more than that. THE INITIATION feels like it has been blessed to convey the inner vibration of love that Babaji and Prema Baba Swamiji wish for readers to feel and know. For when we come to recognize this state of blissful awareness, or Premananda, we realize that we, too, have made the journey to enlightenment.d to convey the inner vibration of love that Babaji and Prema Baba Swamiji wish for readers to feel and know.

Perhaps you know that dogs can tell when their owners are coming home -- but have you ever heard that plants become excited at the exact moment that their people decide to come home? THE SECRET LIFE OF YOUR CELLS describes these and many other startling research findings of polygraph expert and consciousness researcher Cleve Backster.<br />Cleve Backster's familiarity with lie detector equipment and curiosity about how plants would respond when hooked up to a polygraph have led him to discover some amazing facts about plants.  Not only do they seem to be aware of the intentions of people from a distance, but they also can tell the difference between a person simply thinking about burning a plant leaf and actually intending to set a leaf on fire.  When they are warned that cells will soon be dying in their vicinity, they do not react in alarm, but if they have no such forewarning, they react with great agitation to the unexpected deaths.<br />What is it that allows plants -- or even cells which have been removed from a plant or human being -- to know what is happening nearby?  How can simple cells appear to show some kind of primary awareness?  THE SECRET LIFE OF YOUR CELLS asks many such profound questions as it describes many of Cleve Backster's fascinating experiments.  If you have an open mind and a genuine desire to know what's going on in the world, you will absolutely love THE SECRET LIFE OF YOUR CELLS.  Seldom has one book managed so successfully to address the non-local nature of consciousness in the form of describing very concrete experiments, nor managed so clearly to convey the significance of those experimental findings in our lives.  As I read this book and mulled over the fact that all cells are aware and conscious, every moment of my life took on a fresh, new feeling of awe.<br />Part of Backster's genius as an experimenter has been his ingenuity in devising original experiments -- and another aspect of his genius has been his ability to create experiments which are capable of testing plants and cells for their awareness of their surroundings without psychically tipping them off to the intentions of the experimenter.  Backster's experiments depend upon spontaneity and real feelings (just like what happens in the real world), rather than artificial and repetitious redundancy (what most scientific researchers study).  Anyone who is seriously interested in better  understanding the field of consciousness research needs to read this classic book.  Anyone who wishes to understand what their cells are aware of needs to read this amazing book.

Picking up where MIND INTO MATTER left off, Wolf serves the reader thought-provoking tastes of consciousness, memory, lucid dreams, and the awesome and exhilarating concept of the &quot;One-Mind&quot;.<br />MATTER INTO FEELING is a treat for anyone who loves to contemplate ideas such as, &quot;We don't sense what we sense; we sense what we remember we sense.&quot; And this leads us to wonder how it is that we do something so seemingly simple as remember something!<br />When Wolf asks us to consider things such as how the choices we make each day are much more than they appear (since according to the parallel universes model of reality, we try all possibilities, even though we typically only recall choosing one) -- MATTER INTO FEELING becomes a launch pad for personal consciousness transformation.<br />I love the way Wolf brilliantly combines a joyful sense of wonder with modern physical theories and ancient written texts such as the Upanishads and the Qabala. Like the best kind of chef, Wolf serves up a feast which is simultaneously exotic and familiar, yet leaves anyone who tastes it feeling hungry for more.

Author Dawn Baumann Brunke takes us on a journey to a world in which each and every one of us can learn to talk to the animals... and hear them, too.  While this book is primarily a collection of interviews with animals, there are some exercises at the end of the book which can help you get started communicating with the animals in your life.<br />Brunke began her exploration into animal communication as a detached interviewer, yet soon found herself hearing what the birds just outside her window wanted to tell her.  The birds spoke as a group, yet there was a leader who gazed into her house -- and as his flock flew away, he remained behind to finish conveying his message to Brunke.  Was she imagining things?  Could this just be coincidence -- or was she really hearing what the birds were telling her?  As further experiences proved to Brunke that she was indeed hearing what animals were saying, her continuing question and answer sessions with professional animal communicators took on much greater significance.<br />Brunke shares fascinating information from her own communications with animals, and also some rather startling interviews with horses, cats, dogs, buffalo, fish, dolphin, insects, and more.  Many of the animal messages are surprising -- such as the dog who recalls a past life as a bear, the cat from another planet, and the parrot who was once a monk.  Brunke's transformation from attempting to be an objective observer to a confident animal communicator is an inspiration to anyone who would like to learn how to listen to the animals, and she conveys the messages from animals with warmth and humor.  I highly recommend ANIMAL VOICES to every two-legged who feels ready to learn from our furry, feathered, scaly and winged friends!	2002-09-01

Most of us have noticed that most movies being released are predictable, dull, and just plain boring.  It doesn't matter that the films are packed with chase scenes and explosions -- we've seen it all before.  Robert McKee is a visionary intent on bringing fresh creativity to movies in his classic reference book on screenwriting, STORY.  He writes in the introduction to this book,  \\"But my hope for you goes beyond competence and skill.  I'm starved for great films.  Over the last two decades I've seen good films and a few very good films, but rarely, rarely a film of staggering power and beauty.\\"  He adds, \\"I've wriitten STORY to empower your command of the craft, to free you to express an original vision of life, to lift your talent beyond convention to create films of distinctive substance, structure, and style.\\"<br /><br />If you're a screenwriter or novelist, STORY is not a mere nicety, but is an absolute must!  There simply isn't any better guide to writing excellent screenplays -- and this one covers every genre and structure.  McKee is a master at the craft of coaching writers, and he excels at helping writers discover their own unique strengths and weaknesses.  McKee is brilliant at explaining something so basic yet fundamental as the difference between mood and emotion in a scene -- and ideas so subtle as getting the beats just right in a given scene.  McKee's passion for excellence and enthusiasm are contagious, and inspire me to make my writing the best it can be.<br /><br />I find myself so riveted to STORY that I feel adrenaline racing through my when I read this masterpiece.

Most of us suffer from occasional lapses in what we call \\"reason\\" or \\"judgement\\", in which we ignore deeper knowledge of who we are and what we need. This knowledge is fully accessible to each and every one of us, according to Day, who provides fun and informative exercises designed to build up our intuitive talent.<br />PRACTICAL INTUITION sets itself apart from other intuition books by starting with the working assumption that we all have access to universal truths and can see the future, feel how others are feeling, and generally live our lives in mystical fashion. I love this approach to the subject of intuition, because I share these beliefs and enjoy experiencing the magic in life.<br />I love the section Day includes in this book which shows you how you can quickly help almost anyone become your own psychic guru (even when they don't think they are psychic at all) -- for those times when you need an unbiased opinion, and don't want to hire a psychic.

She  advises that our dreams come true more beautifully when we travel lightly, take responsibility for our dreams, and stop being control freaks.  Choquette's many years of teaching workshops on this subject are evident in the enjoyable stories and excercises she includes in each section.

Until reading this book, I hadn't considered what conditions would be necessary in order for our night-time sky to look completely white with stars, nor had I seen such a gorgeous depiction of the micro and macro-cosmic universe in a nutshell (cover illustration). Hawking carefully examines time-travel, predicting the future, and the shape of time after starting the book with an overview of the theory of relativity.  Hawking saves his biggest question for last, to leave readers wondering &quot;Do we live on a brane, or are we just holograms?&quot;  (A brane is something like a membrane.)<br />Thanks to stunning color illustrations and fascinating questions and ideas gracing almost every page, THE UNIVERSE IN A NUTSHELL accesses both the rational and intuitive hemispheres of the reader's brain.  It's the perfect book to unwind with after a long day -- allowing the exotic images and ideas to percolate in your mind like a delicious cup of your favorite hot beverage -- opening your mind to whole new worlds of possibility.<br />Those seeking mathematical equations to accompany their theoretical physics will likely be disappointed by this coffee-table masterpiece, as will readers who prefer to read ground-breaking books which describe entirely new theories in physics.  Pretty much everyone else will be thrilled to take a peek at the &quot;big&quot; questions and ideas being contemplated by the world's most famous physicist.	2002-08-01

Discarnate negative energies cause a wide variety of problems in people, ranging from minor physical ailments, to obsessive thoughts and compulsively destructive behavior, to insanity, to suicide.  Mystical author Robert Bruce describes these otherwise unseen things, and describes how and why Negs attack, and ways that these attacks can often be stopped even as they are occurring (by crossing over boundaries of running water, for example).<br />Negs who are attached to a human host can (and will) strike out against the target of any negative feelings their host may have.  All the unsuspecting host knows is that they were watching television and every now and then grumbling internally about how upset they were with someone else -- but in that trancelike state, those grumblings direct negative energy towards the target!  Negs feed on such energy, and are delighted to wreak havoc and mayhem at every opportunity.  Those who dabble in black magic are often surrounded by negative energies, and any time they so much as feel angry or hurt by another, terrible things happen to the people they were upset with.<br />What I love most about Bruce's book is it's no-nonsense style.  It does not attempt to prove to disbelieving readers that negative energies exist, but rather dives into the matter at hand of what to do when demons cause mayhem in one's life. Bruce describes his favorite techniques for dealing with Negs, and describes times these methods have proven themselves effective.<br />I also love the way Robert Bruce describes failured rescue attempts -- such as a time when a priest was called in to do an exorcism for a tormented family, but was unable to prevent the parents from dying suddenly. Bruce does not attempt to sugar-coat things, or say that all cases of possession can easily be overcome! Those of us who have encountered some especially difficult cases of negative energies know this is not the case. Negs are not necessarily easy to dismiss, and definitely don't just leave when someone asks them nicely to go.<br />Bruce says it like it is, and helps us all find new ways of dealing with \\"The Dark Side\\", which I find most refreshing and wonderful!  Whether you are are skeptical about the existence of negative energies or deal with them on a daily basis, you'll find much of value in PRACTICAL PSYCHIC SELF-DEFENSE.  I give this book my highest recommendation!easily be overcome! Those of us who have encountered some especially difficult cases of negative energies know this is not the case.

While Danaos gladly shares the foundations for the training he received from nei kung master John Chang, he cautiously avoids providing so much information that readers working without aid of skilled trainers could get themselves into trouble (and spontaneously combust).<br />Nei-kung utilizes both yin and yang energies to sense conditions in patients' bodies and aid in healing, and can also be used for increasing one's strength and performing astonishing feats.  Yin energy is capable of absorbing energy from speeding bullets or cars, leaving human practioners unharmed.  Yang energy is noted for how hot it feels (John Chang can set crumpled papers on fire from a distance with it), and it's preference to flow upward through the body.  Nei-kung harnesses the yin and yang energies together, and requires regular meditation practice and chakra awareness to master the art of moving yin and yang energy within and beyond one's own body.<br />Danaos wrote NEI KUNG as a level two practioner of Mo-Pai, which has left matching dark circular scars about 4 mm in diameter on his palms near the pericardium meridian acupuncture points.  Danaos explains, &quot;These stigmata are essentially localized hyperemia generated by the flow of bioenergy, which the doctors monitoring me could not explain with Western medicine.  I could use those 'wounds' to feel the condition of a patient's body, sensing the flow of the ch'i throughout his or her organs and limbs.&quot;<br />Danaos is a wonderful story-teller who combines fascinating personal accounts with historical overviews and illustrations of ancient art to clarify the significance of subjects ranging from DNA to chakra knots to the warrior elite.  NEI KUNG makes excellent reading for energy practioners and armchair explorers alike who are ready to feel yin and yang energy -- and learn more about how these two work together.yang energy -- and learn more about how these two work together.	2002-07-06

Chia has devoted his life to studying meditation, tai chi chuan, aikido, yoga, kundalini, and many forms of inner alchemy.  Chia's books are intended to be supplemental guides to energy training, and are primarily intended for readers who are familiar with energy work.  The focus in this book is primarily on inner yin and yang breath work (nei kung), rather than outer breath work such as chi kung -- although some of these techniques are described in detail in this book as well.  AWAKEN HEALING LIGHT is one of an estimated 35 books that Chia intends to write in order to fully cover the Universal Tao system (Chia has completed more than 20 of these books already).<br />I am very pleased to see how Chia explains the founding principles of his Universal Tao system:  \\"The system I learned from my master is based on the positive energies of love, kindness, gentleness, respect, and honesty; this is the highest Chi Kung practice.  With these energies an adept can counteract all kinds of evil.  It is said that even fire cannot hurt one who has perfected their use.\\"<br />At more than 550 pages, AWAKEN HEALING LIGHT is a veritable encyclopedia of information.  It's the kind of book I like to read cover-to-cover and then return to as a reference book for refreshers on various aspects.  This book is organized into sixteen information-packed chapters which describe:  an overview of Taoist inner alchemy, the connection between chi and meditation, how to transform negative emotional energies, techniques for activating and amplifying original chi, points along the microcosmic orbit (a circular path for circulating chi in the body), the microcosmic orbit, how to work with Earth energy, how to work with Cosmic (higher self) energy, how to open the heart and practice the Cosmic inner smile, and much, much more.<br />Chia includes numerous illustrations to thoroughly clarify how to work with yin and yang energy.  I highly recommend AWAKEN HEALING LIGHT to anyone who is seriously interested in improving the energy flow in their body for improved mental and physical health and well-being and wants precise, detailed information on mastering the flow of yin and yang energy in the body.ith yin and yang energy.

Keith Chandler's book PSI is a tour de force of insight into the inner workings of phenomena such as telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, and psychokinesis as it presents a thoughtful and inspired model of reality that includes these &quot;psi&quot; phenomena.<br />Chandler presents the notion that remembering within the field of Cosmic Mind could well be the key to learning how it is possible for people to know what's going on in locations geographically far away, or off in the distant future.  While Chandler admits to limited experience with some of the phenomena he includes in PSI (such as future memory), he nonetheless maintains an open mind and a keen eye to correlating personal and anecdotal experiences with viable scientific theories and experimental results.<br />Written in the style of an erudite professor and packed with eye-opening references to current scientific research (from REM sleep to the honeybee's &quot;wiggle dance&quot; and remote viewing), PSI takes the reader to a place of epiphany where for at least one shining moment -- it all makes sense.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who genuinely wishes to consider new models of reality that include &quot;psi&quot; phenomena.	2002-06-12

From the first opening pages, this book transports the reader to a universe in which any and every synchronous experience is possible, and may well happen to you.<br />Just as Cousineau noted that synchronous events became much more prevalent in his life as he worked on SOUL MOMENTS, so too will the reader find these wondrous experiences begin to grace this otherwise hum-drum, workaday world.  Suddenly we discover there is magic all around us, and it's for real!<br />I would love to tell you which synchronicity stories are my favorites from this beautiful collection -- but in truth, I find them all to be sparkling in clarity and bright with inspiration.  After reading the moving accounts shared by observant individuals from all walks of life (including Larry Dossey and Huston Smith), even the smallest things no longer seem insignificant.<br />Treat yourself to a deeper view of the world that grows on you with each passing story, and get yourself a copy of SOUL MOMENTS.

According to Arana, quite a lot. The key to transforming your life is in transforming your perception of reality -- and it is essential to request assistance from both the elemental force (also known as God, or Spirit) as well as a human support group -- and then to start acting in accordance with the behavior appropriate to your new place of perception. You can change channels in your life from one reality to another just like changing channels on TV, by tuning in to a different perceptual station with sufficient energy and intent.<br />Arana clearly elucidates the striking similarities between AA's 12 step program and Toltec sorcery techniques taught by Carlos Castaneda by sharing intimate revelations about her own experiences with overcoming alcoholism. Arana also describes her fascinating experiences with lucid dreaming as she describes how difficult it could be at times to detach her energetic &quot;double&quot; from her physical body, and some of the side-effects of lucid dreaming (such as hearing voices, and knowing intimate and seemingly unknowable details about others).<br />I highly recommend this book for its excellent down-to-Earth writing, original ideas, and fascinating insights into how you can make small shifts in perception in order to make big changes in your life.  THE PATH is an intensely practical and transformative book which I'm sure I will still be thinking about months and years later, telling all my friends about at every opportunity!	2002-05-12

I also saw this spectacular film footage, and was quite impressed by it -- it was the most memorable and amazing part of the whole film.<br />Danaos was so moved by seeing the film of the mysterious man with the pyrokinetic powers that he set out from his homeland in Greece to find him, and ask if he would accept Danaos as a student. Fortunately for us, Danaos succeeded.  His book tells the story of how the amazing Chinese-Javanese acupuncturist and martial artist John Chang came to be &quot;The Magus of Java&quot;, and includes some highly personal accounts of his early training with his neikung master.<br />Many people will be skeptical that there are individuals who can train themselves to levitate, be telepathic, and have precise control over telekinetic abilities.  If you cannot suspend your disbelief, this book might be unsettling to you.  Since I have personally experienced a wide range of rather amazing incidents (including putting my hand through several layers of clothing I was wearing to touch my own bare skin underneath), overwhelming doubt is not an impediment to my keeping an open mind about the remarkable claims made by Kostas Danaos of John Chang's abilities.<br />What sets THE MAGUS OF JAVA apart is the way Danaos presents the concept of learning to work with yin and yang energy as being the key to mastering one's ability to extend the powers of one's mind beyond one's body.  Only limited results are possible when we work with just yang energy -- while incredible things are possible with a combination of yin and yang.  The yin and yang are much like polar opposites, and when energy is intentionally allowed to flow between the yin and yang designated areas, miraculous things can occur.  I especially loved the many stories of the &quot;Taoist Immortals&quot; sprinkled liberally throughout this book, as they helped to point out that humans with god-like powers can sometimes cause as much damage as they can bring healing and good to the world.<br />While many martial arts and bioenergetic schools work exclusively with yang energy (and a few work with yin energy), there are precious few who appreciate and integrate a combination of the yin energy with the yang.  The system of neikung that John Chang teaches contains 72 levels of mastery, and the reason that only the first four are rudimentarily covered in this book is that it is extremely dangerous to practice these meditations without a teacher's guidance.  Several people died as this form of neikung was being developed by trial-and-error, since the two energies of yin and yang when compressed and placed side by side have tremendous power to destroy.<br />I give this book my highest recommendation to any serious student of spirituality, metaphysics, or the martial arts.  Reading it with an open mind will show you a world of new possibilities, and might just change your life!I especially loved the many stories of the &quot;Taoist Immortals&quot; sprinkled liberally throughout this book, as they helped to point out that humans with god-like powers can sometimes cause as much damage as they can bring healing and good to the world.<br />While many martial arts and bioenergetic schools work exclusively with yang energy (and a few work with yin energy), there are precious few who appreciate and integrate a combination of the yin energy with the yang.

He was about thirteen (actually fourteen but appeared much younger), and had a little brother with him.  He saw that around this boy was an aura of such brightness and glory as he said no one else in Adyar had, and that was so outstanding to him that he at once made friends with the two brothers.&quot;<br />Thus begins a most unusual relationship between the very young Krishnamurti and the Theosophical Society (Annie Besant was appointed guardian of Krishnamurti and his beloved younger brother one year later, in 1910.  There were many advantages and disadvantages to the transformed life Krishnamurti led, and this book covers all the most interesting facets of Krishnamurti's life with beautiful photographs, hand-written journal entries, and interviews with Krishnamurti and other great thinkers of his time.<br />This is the story of a man devoted to giving spiritual teachings -- a man who inspired many (including Bruce Lee, Van Morrison, Henry Miller, Deepak Chopra, and Joseph Campbell) with his tremendous wisdom and clarity.  Many of Krishnamurti's thoughts and quotes are included, such as, &quot;In yourself lies the whole world, and if you know how to look and learn, then the door is there and the key is in your hand.  Nobody on earth can give you either that key or the door to open except yourself.&quot;<br />I highly recommend this book, both for its exquisite attention to the details and big picture of Krishnamurti's life, and for the inspirational wisdom it imparts to the reader.	2002-04-15

Ever since he was a child, Brent benefited from the compassionate guidance of spirits who shared insights, amazing stories, and the occasional smelly herbal potion with him.  Brent Lee's clarity and down-to-Earth practicality was clearly a great benefit to him during the many years he worked as a counselor in the US Navy, where he traveled the world and learned from a variety of spiritual teachers.  Brent shares both the teachings of his spirit guides and the wisdom he learned from people around the world in this fascinating overview of our true spiritual nature.<br />Brent Lee includes a large number of useful exercises in this book, after first presenting a historical overview for each concept.  These exercises can help you see your spirit guides, identify your dream symbols, notice what different levels of consciousness feel like, learn how to communicate psychically through the dreamplane we all share, discover how to enter the consciousness of others, practice exploring your past, view possible outcomes of the choices you make, connect with other forms of consciousness, connect with your soul, and practice telekinesis.<br />I especially enjoy reading the stories Brent shares -- such as the times he played astral travel tag with a friend of his.  He could usually catch his friend, because he did not share his friend's belief that it was impossible to walk through furniture!  Brent describes an earlier out-of-body experience in which he walked half-way through his closed bedroom door, when the thought ran through his mind that he could not walk through solid objects.  &quot;Since I was already half way through the door, I became imprisoned within the door.  For a moment, I felt fear:  how was I going to explain this predicament to my family?  Then I 'got a grip' on myself and remembered that in my spirit form, I am not limited by physical structures.  With that realization, I received a mild shock from the door as I passed on through.

Whether I'm in a good mood or feeling down, this book always picks me up!  Thanks to Stuart, I now know that \\"I don't have to beat myself up\\", \\"I deserve good things\\", and \\"I refuse to live from crisis to crisis\\"!  I have to keep reminding myself about that last one, because my computer connection keeps dropping out as I try to type this review.<br />I'M GOOD ENOUGH tells the story of how Stuart Smalley (a caring nurturer and a member of several twelve step programs, but not a licensed therapist) deals with his inner critic and his dysfunctional family through the pages of his daily journal.  I won't give away the plot, but will just give you a hint that there are lots of ups and downs in Stuart's career and family which help him grow in unexpected ways (such as the day when he notes \\"This Time I Was in Bed for Only Five Days!\\")<br />If you ever need to laugh with love at life's foibles, this is the book for you!  OK -- I'm not saying you HAVE to get this book, because then I would be telling you what to do.  You are in control of your own life, and things are not black and white!

You're probably well aware that plants and single cell organisms have thoughts and feelings from having read or heard about books like \\"The Secret Life of Plants\\" -- yet do you know that you have a virtual planet full of individuals hanging on your every emotion and mental direction?  The average adult is made up of 100 trillion cells, and each and every one of the cells in your body is alive and actively involved in the process of evaluating how to perceive what's happening to you right now and act appropriately.<br />Janet Buell's excellent book, YOUR MIND & BODY ARE A CORPORATION -- AND YOU ARE THE CEO is based on the metaphor of a company with various departments and a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) -- you!  I guarantee that after you've done the exercises in Buell's book, your corporal self will be feeling much healthier, prosperous, and harmonious.<br />YOUR MIND AND BODY ARE A CORPORATION is packed with fascinating concepts such as the notion that, \\"... your body has its own sense of closeness to the bodies of your sexual partner, children or parents.  The cells recognize and have great affinity for each other.  Even a divorce that you welcome may be a loss to the cells of your body who had established an intimate relationship with the body of your soon-to-be ex.\\"  Buell then provides exercises for recovering from such losses that have occurred in the past, looking to your body for help.<br />I was a bit surprised at first to find this book consists of so many blank worksheet pages, but was  delighted to discover it is designed to be a workbook you can use as you become a more competent manager in charge of all those trillions of cells.  The process of developing your managerial skills involves a great deal of two-way communication between you (the CEO) and all your cells, and Buell provides an excellent starting point.  Numerous messages are provided for you to say aloud to your cells, so they will understand your new dedication and commitment to their well-being.  You may be surprised at how exciting it feels to begin such a discussion!  If you're like me, once you get started with this two-way dialogue, you won't want to quit.<br />I highly recommend Buell's book as the perfect way to pull yourself together.  It's worth doing, if only for the fact that your cells (all 100 trillion of them) will thank you for it!well-being.  You may be surprised at how exciting it feels to begin such a discussion!

While wise men know that \\"truth is a slippery fish\\", Eckhart manages to sustain clear focus on the most common areas of difficulty for spiritual seekers (such as ego idenfitication with the pain-body) without getting lost in the inherent fluidity of the topic of how to be here now.<br />THE POWER OF NOW is one of those books I read quickly, feeling that I am already aware of everything it says.  I had this same response to \\"Conversations with God\\", finding that it's contents were quite obvious to me already.  I am learning that when I have this reaction to a spiritual book, it indicates the book in question is destined for greatness!  POWER OF NOW is written in layman's terms about some of the most profound metaphysical and spiritual insights.<br />If you are interested in a clearer understanding of the true nature of one of the most fundamental dimensions in your life -- time -- I could not recommend a better book to get you started on your quest!  For those interested in deepening the understanding of this most mysterious thing, I'd recommend reading one of Tarthang Tulku's excellent books on space, time and knowledge.	2002-03-09

This book is ideal for advanced healers who are comfortable and experienced with doing healings and discerning a wide variety of energy conditions in people. While basic healing techniques are clearly described in the beginning, the majority of this book presumes a fair amount of experience and proficiency with color healings on the part of the reader. Those just starting out with color healing may still find this book useful, as it clearly describes what healers see and feel as they are doing pranic healings.<br />I am impressed with the breadth and depth of conditions described in this book along with their associated treatments. Everything from migraine headaches, inner ear infections, torn tendons, dislocations, to internal wounds, cataracts, kidney stones and deafness are discussed in detail. Recommendations on color density (lightness or darkness) as well as energization are given with explanations which I found illuminating and intriguing. Master Choa's experience with prana is evident throughout this beautifully written and illustrated book, leaving readers feeling inspired and well-informed. This book's index is clearly organized, so the healer can look up recommended treatments until such time as the underlying logic of it all sinks in (such as avoiding use of orange healing energies around peoples' heads, and paying attention to which way one's fingers are pointing).<br />Even though I mostly utilize universal healing energies, such as Reiki, I still find ADVANCED PRANIC HEALING immensely useful for its insights into what kinds of frequencies are best suited for various ailments. I recommend this book for anyone doing color healings, as well as those wishing to catch an intimate and revealing glimpse of the healer's world.	2002-03-09

What sets Mossman's book apart from the pack is that it's the best summary of seven simple things that every best-selling book has (and that non-best-selling books lack) I've ever seen in one place.  As Mossman points out, even the best marketing plans in the world can't compensate for a book that bores readers.  Readers have straightforward expectations from books they can't put down -- and Tam does a first-rate job of clarifying what those expectations are, so any writer can begin to see their manuscript from the reader's point-of-view.<br />Mossman's enthusiasm for good writing imbues his book with a high-energy buzz that I find invigorating before each editing sessions with one of my manuscripts.  I wolfed down his book in one fast sitting, and now savor it at random points by flipping it open and contemplating anew one of his writing revelations.  The seven strategies seem deceptively simple, and in that simplicity lies elegance and the road to success.<br />I feel Mossman's book has been unfairly criticized for being less useful to non-fiction authors.  As an author of two forthcoming books, one fiction and one non-fiction, I find Mossman's points equally valid for both genres.  SEVEN STRATEGIES IN EVERY BEST-SELLER provided me with the epiphany that there is a main character in my non-fiction book, and she is ME!  This simple but powerful point is transforming my factual manuscript into a book with my story forming the main story line throughout the book.<br />I am very excited to see the huge difference in readability that my book is undergoing as I edit it using Mossman's tips and pointers -- it's had a makeover from textbook to page-turner, and I love it!<br />Whether you are staring at the first blank page of your new manuscript, or desire to make an existing book much more readable, I give SEVEN STRATEGIES IN EVERY BEST-SELLER my highest recommendation.	2002-02-22

This scientific approach tends to blind them to the potential scope of the vast unknown territory ahead.  Non-traditional researchers, inventors, and thinkers, on the other hand, tend to use a 'plane' to fly into the wilderness and then work their way back, and in the process, they create the maps for the less daring to follow after them.&quot;<br />Our knowledge of the human aura, subtle energy bodies, nadis, chakras, and acupuncture meridians has historically resided primarily with those guides we entrust to inform us:  energy healers, shamans, lightworkers, mystics, priests, and others.  Only in relatively recent years has modern-day technology allowed everyday people to begin to view the aura in much the same way that these spiritual masters have been seeing it for years.  CAPTURING THE AURA describes a variety of imaging techniques, such as kirlian photography, full-body imaging, and interactive imaging, as well as providing useful information about auric sight, breath techniques, qi, and the emotions that accompany various auric colors.<br />What I love most about CAPTURING THE AURA is the way the contributing authors each share their own areas of experience after they've &quot;flown their planes into the wilderness and worked their way back&quot; -- thereby providing readers with invaluable maps we can put together into a bigger picture.  This book contains one of the best compilations of modern-day knowledge concerning seeing and understanding the human aura with contributions from:  C.E. Lindgren, Blythe Arakawa, Jacques Beauchamp, Robert Bruce, Fritjof Capra, Guy Coggins, Ruby K. Corder, Janice Dye, Gerald Owen Grow, Arnold Keyserling, Ralph Losey, William T.

In simple language with clear illustrations, Eden outlines ways to release stress, restore energies, escape the grip of fear, concentrate in the midst of fear and stress, feel joyful more often, overcome digestive problems, mend broken arms and legs, overcome nervousness, calm people (and yourself), relieve arthritic pain, relieve muscle cramps, relieve low back pain, and regain control when feeling hysterical.<br />I would be thrilled with any book that so clearly outlines techniques for helping people with such a wide variety of ailments, aches and pains, but ENERGY MEDICINE goes several steps further.  Eden describes the body's energy meridians, chakra balancing, and how to do the &quot;celtic weave&quot;.  As Eden explains, &quot;The Celtic weave, as an energy system, laces through all your other energy systems and creates a resonance among them.  It is the weaver of your force fields.  It holds your entire energetic structure together.  As an exercise, you use the Celtic weave to pulse your aura's energies outward and to strengthen them.  The exercise also connects all your energies together so they operate as a single web.  Touch one strand, anywhere, and your whole system reverberates in harmony.&quot;<br />I love the way ENERGY MEDICINE includes a vast assortment of fascinating real-life stories of energy healings that Donna Eden has been involved in, including her own recovery from being bitten by a poisonous insect in Fiji.  The shamans in Fiji treated Donna for her bite by burying her up to her neck in sand for long stretches several times over a two day period, believing the toxins would be drained into the sand.  Donna recovered her full health in Fiji, and shortly thereafter began her studies of energy healing.<br />I highly recommend ENERGY MEDICINE to anyone with an interest in energy healing.  Experienced energy healers and novices can all find much of great value in this essential reference book.f great value in this essential reference book.	2002-01-30

Maggie Steincrohn Davis' book about loving and caring for ourselves and others is true food for the soul, written like poetry.  Thirty-one graceful entries gently serve up tasty morsels of ancient wisdom (such as how to see from the heart, or face times when loved ones are dying) alongside a garnish of amusing and heart-warming personal anecdotes.<br />I love the way Maggie understands all the subtle nuances of care-giving, and the ways love can reach through any situation, when we imagine it can.  She writes, \\"Only by reaching 'beyond-the-beyond' of people -- behind their eyes, back of their pain, beneath their blaming and irritation and fussing -- do we make a path to the best in them.  Treating someone with compassion who does not treat us well in return might be our fullest offering of love, as well as our own greatest relief during the daily rounds of vigilance and giving.\\"<br />In this book, every sentence feels like a prayer and a meditation on love and compassion.  As I read each comforting entry, I find myself feeling like I'm back in the warm, sunny days of my childhood -- snugly wrapped by my mother in a fluffy towel after a warm bath.  CARING IN REMEMBERED WAYS can help brighten and warm even the darkest, coldest days in one's life.  It's the ideal pick-me-up for anyone who grows weary of caring for and nurturing others, and even oneself.	2002-01-30

Offering meditation for the meditatively challenged, yoga exercises for couch potatoes, karma for skeptics, prayer for the faithless and enlightenment for the ignorant -- EXPLORING MEDITATION blazes new trails into eastern philosophy that almost anyone can easily master.  Written in a clear, descriptive, straightforward style, this book opens the doors to understanding non-duality, chakras, ESP (extra-sensory perception), karma, yoga, meditation, intuition, healing, vedas, gunas, and spirit.<br />I personally most enjoy reading the sections on how to trouble-shoot one's meditation problems.  Have you ever intended to meditate, but kept finding the same tedious thoughts racing through your mind?  How about the problem of listening carefully, but not getting any clear messages?  Susan Shumsky answers all these questions and more with grace and aplomb.<br />Have you longed for a \\"Do-Nothing\\" method of meditation?  Would you like to learn the art of yogic breathing, and discover how grace overcomes karma?  Are you ready to become spiritually street-smart?  Are you interested in learning what we are made of and how we fit into the cosmos?  Do you want to discover the personal aspects of your divine, higher self?

MIND-REACH conveys the early excitement felt by researchers investigating psychic phenomena in America at the same time as it illuminates the need for careful consideration to the implications of psychic phenomena.  Numerous photographs, charts, and sketches help make the descriptions of remote viewing experiments tangible and real for the reader.<br />Authors Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff bring their experience as physicists at the world-famous Stanford Research Institute (SRI) to bear on the subject of paraphysical phenomena, and help ensure that scientific methods are followed throughout their experiments.  Targ and Puthoff are pioneers in the field of remote viewing, and many of the experiments described in MIND-REACH are classics which are frequently referred to today.<br />Many of the subjects who participated in the experiments described in MIND-REACH are well-known figures today:  Ingo Swann, Patrick Price, Uri Geller, and &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; author Richard Bach.  Margaret Mead wrote the introduction for this outstanding book, and Richard Bach wrote the forward.<br />It's well worth the effort to find a copy of this classic book, if you are interested in reviewing some of the original remote viewing experimental results.	2001-11-28

Starting from the basic premises with which quantum physics rocked the world and moving forward to psychological implications of how the world changes as we change the way we view it, this anesthesiologist-turned-science-teacher drives her message home:  you can make anything happen!<br />McWayne describes consciousness as being &quot;not only implied by the equations for how the universe works&quot;, but also as being, &quot;the transcendent multidimensional source and substance of the universe itself.&quot;  If this concept is new to you, you'll find RADICAL REALITY to be a wonderful adventure, and if you already are familiar with both physics and consciousness, chances are good that you'll find this book to be scrumptious food for thought.	2001-11-26

Waters wrote this book with assistance from thirty-two Hopi elders back in 1963.  Much time has passed since then, and while the way of the Hopi remains mostly unchanged, access to their sacred ceremonies and rituals has been greatly reduced in the last several decades.<br />While BOOK OF THE HOPI was written through the eyes and ears of an outsider, it contains much of the spirit of the Hopi, and countless fascinating insights. One such example is the explanation of how one sacred ceremony (the Ya Ya) was profaned and is no longer performed, since much of its powers were taken for evil. &quot;When you receive a wonderful power and use it for evil you lose the power. You have to use it for good to keep it.&quot;<br />I love the richness of information contained in this little book: symbols, the tablets of the clans, a glossary of Hopi words, thrilling tales about the creation of the worlds, and detailed descriptions of sacred objects such as the Paho (prayer-feather). This attention to detail is marvelous, but it's the heart of BOOK OF THE HOPI that makes me feel at home with the Hopi and at one with their spirit.<br />I give this book my highest recommendation.	2001-11-20

Penny Kelly addresses this question and others in her absorbing book, THE ELVES OF LILY HILL FARM.  This is the story of how she met and learned to work with and trust the elves and nature spirits on her organic farm in order to succeed in her goal of harvesting 100 tons of grapes in a season -- a truly spectacular yield.<br /><br />From Penny's first encounters with elves and devas (whom she sketches at the back of her book) to her discussions with vines, weeds, and various marauding animal nuisances -- the reader gains a sense of what it feels like to be in communication with the vast variety of intelligent life around us every day. Is it possible to communicate with the plants and animals around us? Absolutely. Is this communication a one-way street? Hopefully not! Kelly's tale inspired me to pay more attention to the way I interact with the intelligent life all around me -- being a bit more conscious to listen instead of just commanding orders of what I expect to occur.<br />I especially loved reading the comments and questions the elves posed for Penny -- including such deceptively simple queries such as, &quot;How is it ye choose among the activities that come before ye?&quot; The insights Penny gained as she found a way towards achieving balance in her life are valuable to us all, whether or not we are raising organic produce.	2001-11-20

I am impressed with the way author Barbara Ann Brennan describes her early childhood experiences of sensing energy fields around trees and all living things, and even more impressed that after many years of training in physics and western ways of scientism, she never lost her inner sense of knowing.<br />HANDS OF LIGHT includes many pictures of auras and chakras, which serve to illustrate her points about how to identify common personality types and relationship types based on her in-depth personal healing experiences.  Brennan also proceeds to explain how to help improve one's health by working on one's energy field.<br />Full enjoyment of HANDS OF LIGHT requires that the reader either have an open mind regarding the fact that many people can see auras and chakras, or the ability to see these things oneself.  Brennan provides exercises to help people learn how to see energy fields, so any reader with a sincere interest in the subject of energy healing will most likely be very satisfied with this classic book.	2001-11-20

This book will most appeal to readers who love books they can ponder for some time, as it is packed with such ideas as:  sensory arrays, etheric light cones, nodal networks and holograms.<br />The main point of SCIENCE AND HUMAN TRANSFORMATION is that the component of mind and consciousness has long been excluded from scientific study, and even omitted from Theories Of Everything (TOEs).  Obviously, if we're going to have a theory of everything it had better include consciousness!  Tiller knows this quite well, and artfully constructs a bridge for future scientists with open minds to cross over to a place where unseen things (such as human energy fields) have huge effects.  If we want to know what has eluded us for so long, we need to go to the very places which are currently least well understood.  SCIENCE AND HUMAN TRANSFORMATION provides a sturdy bridge for us to reach those previously unknown places.	2001-11-08

I was surprised and delighted to find that this book far surpassed all my expectations! I found it to be especially intriguing, because it was written in large part by the Shuar themselves.<br />The Shuar share their wisdom about how they dream the world, talk with the dead, balance the needs of men and women, keep peace and wage war, practice the ancient art of shamanic journeying, and learn from the sacred teacher plants (ayahuasca, datura, chicha, and tobacco) in the Amazon jungle they inhabit. The Shuar tell their legends and personal stories about living in the jungle in this book in such a conversational style that I feel I am sitting among them.<br />After reading this book, I feel I can understand why people take psychotropic plants in order to better understand their unique place in this world. I also find myself feeling deeply touched by the way the Shuar have long reached out to others in different societies to form special bonds of friendship and cooperation. The obvious sincerity with which the Shuar express themselves comes shining through in this book. It is quite convincing to me and helps open my mind to every topic they discuss, even subjects that surprise me, such as: head-hunting, marital relationships, or how they share wisdom from the teaching plants with their hunting dogs and children.<br />Anyone interested in indigenous wisdom, different ways of living, or shapeshifting will definitely be fascinated by this excellent book by John Perkins and Shuar shapeshifter Chumpi.

I love the way Kelly shares the full breadth and depth of her highly personal experience, and the way she describes the many varied effects of kundalini (such as heightened sensory and extra-sensory awareness). In sequential fashion, Kelly tells the story of how she first entered the realm of &quot;I AM&quot; knowingness, and how she gradually began to feel and appreciate the way her kundalini experience sensitized her to the world.  Little by little, Kelly found herself learning to use the great power and wisdom conferred by kundalini, even as her rational mind continued to search for answers and a deep understanding of what had happened to her.  In addition to providing a personal record of kundalini awakening, THE EVOLVING HUMAN also has a series of appendixes which provide a description of the stages of human spiritual evolution, and some useful pointers for analyzing dreams, and improving one's telepathic skills.<br />In one of the most fascinating parts of this book, Kelly describes how she lived through a period of time in which she felt herself living out two future paths along with her normal day-to-day life. One was much &quot;safer&quot; yet ultimately less satisfying, while the other was more true to living up to her full spiritual potential. She chose the path of fulfilling her potential, and I am certain that the world is a much better place for it! Kelly now lives at Lily Hill Farm in Michigan, where she teaches classes about developing intuition as she works in the gardens, barns, and kitchens. THE EVOLVING HUMAN began as a series of hand-outs for these classes, and due to popular demand grew into this beautiful book.<br />My kundalini awakening took place in 1994, and many things Kelly describes in THE EVOLVING HUMAN remind me of experiences I've lived through. How wonderful it is to have this book at one's side, as reassurance that kundalini is a normal part of the process of human spiritual evolution. I give this book my highest recommendation for anyone who wishes to better understand how the kundalini experience transforms one's life.f the process of human spiritual evolution.

Books	5	26	26	N	N	Creating Your Ideal Life With Love and Joy	MANIFESTING 101 is a collection of uplifting short essays that are as easy, fun, and entertaining to read as they are informative.  Susan James and six contributors (William Wayne Barnes, Kristen Fox, Tom Haskins, Carol James, Jeri Noble, and John Welsh) share their personal accounts and tips of how they create their lives out of love and joy, rather than feelings of constant struggle and a sensation of being overwhelmed.<br />James provides playful tools for mastering the requisite skills of reality creation, such as focusing on one's desire for at least seventeen seconds (try writing out it three times with your non-dominant hand). Going beyond the &quot;law of attraction&quot; whereby the universe brings more of what resonates with what we are emoting right to us, MANIFESTING 101 moves on to cover the &quot;laws of allowing&quot;, and &quot;laws of deliberate creation&quot;. Can we bring anything we truly desire into our lives? The answer is a resounding, &quot;YES!&quot; when we choose to feel good FIRST, and then allow the universe's generous gifts to stream into our lives.<br />I especially enjoy reading the personal accounts of manifestation in MANIFESTING 101. These true stories provide heart-warming and often humorous descriptions of how we can all learn to get out of our own way when we are creating lives we love. This is more than just an excellent book to read, it's a book you'll be glad to live your life by!	2001-07-08

John Kehoe asserts that when we spend just five minutes a day, each and every day, concentrating on how that's a done deal and feeling our joy at our accomplishments, this will indeed be true!  As Kehoe succinctly states, &quot;Consciousness creates reality, and you create consciousness.&quot;<br />MIND POWER is so clear and straightforward that you can read it in a day, and then come back to review the exercises in each chapter as you work on refining your mind power skills.  Kehoe's book is chock-full of creative insights into how you can see your unconscious patterns of thoughts at work, and begin to turn your life around by changing what and how you think.  Kehoe explains how good health, a successful career, exciting vacations, a beautiful home and rewarding personal relationships are just a few of the things you can bring into your life by mastering MIND POWER techniques.<br />One of the clearest examples of how Kehoe elucidates the otherwise complex subject of how we create reality with consciousness is the way he describes prosperity consciousness.  Kehoe isolates the four main prosperity beliefs, and outlines them so clearly that the reader's own path to prosperity shines like a road paved with gold!  (It's an abundant universe, life is fun and rewarding, there are staggering numbers of opportunities in every aspect of my life, and it is my responsibility to be successful.)<br />Kehoe reminds us, &quot;Every person is a star&quot;.

We've been taught backwards -- we've learned to forcefully push forward like the Lone Ranger riding off at full gallop to get what we want in life.  This lone ranger approach usually serves to exhaust us while making little headway into bringing the things we wish we had to us (such as good health, a loving home, fulfilling relationships, rewarding work, and money).<br />&quot;Yes, yes&quot;, you may reply, &quot;That all sounds great, but I've tried similar things before, and never noticed a difference&quot;.  You'll be glad to know that EXCUSE ME, YOUR LIFE IS WAITING is written just for you!  It's packed with pointers for how to break through your own unique barriers to a life of well-being, as well as real-life examples of what a difference our feelings make based on Grabhorn's own fascinating life story.  What makes Grabhorn's book so compelling is that she describes the tale of her own transformation. Grabhorn was once proficient at making things happen with hard work, perspiration, and ever-vigilant worry -- and has become a woman who starts out by feeling love and appreciation, and who has now become healthy and prosperous in every way.<br />How fast can you expect to see results?  Grabhorn outlines a 30 day program, by which she changed her own life from focusing on energy-draining feelings to flip-switching over to appreciate the good things in life.  All we have to do is follow the four main steps:  identify what we don't want, identify what we DO want, find the feeling place of our want, and expect the universe to deliver.	2001-07-08

Perhaps you tried hearing the &quot;little voice&quot; of intuition, but weren't sure whether you were hearing the best advice for you to follow... or perhaps you couldn't hear anything at all.<br />Not to worry!  Susan Shumsky's wonderful book, DIVINE REVELATION, describes how to find deeply meaningful answers to all your questions -- as well as how you can follow nine steps of discernment to ensure that the voice of intuition you hear is a true message from Spirit.  She lists eleven safeguards to ensure you receive divine messages, as well as signals for healing and &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; responses, and fourteen steps for receiving clear answers.  Shumsky also describes how to word your questions for Spirit, so you will gain maximal benefit from the answers you receive.<br />The basic premise of Shumsky's book is that we can receive information and inspiration simply by asking for it, so she provides mediations and prayers to help get us started.  Shumsky recommends that healing prayers be utilized often, since they are essential for clearing out negative habits, thoughts, feelings, and psychic ties to others before we attempt to clearly receive spiritual messages.<br />Whether you have never before received messages from Spirit or are quite adept at it, DIVINE REVELATION is jam-packed with wonderful ideas to help you receive information more clearly than ever before.  There is a tremendous emphasis on self-knowledge in this book, so those who are willing and eager to look more deeply at themselves will likely enjoy it the most.	2001-06-07

Robinson's playful sense of humor (&quot;... you may begin to wish that God's call came with Caller I.D.!&quot;) brings the lofty ideas of talking to God right down to Earth, and her experience helping people learn to listen to divine intuition is evident from the exercises, questions, and stories in her book.<br />The big ideas in DIVINE INTUITION may take a while to grab you, but you'll know it when they do!  This book is the perfect tool for change for anyone who longs to turn their life around, but doesn't know quite where to start... or for those who are facing difficult choices and wish there was a clear-cut best answer.  While Robinson does not guarantee that you'll soon be hearing God's voice telling you exactly what to do next, she does suggest that we don't need to postpone our happiness.  When we listen to our heart and hear what it has to say, we'll feel inspired to do and be what we most love.	2001-06-07

If so, DIVINE GUIDANCE is the book for you!<br />Doreen Virtue makes readers feel instantly at home as she explains in simple language how all of us can communicate directly with God in her beautiful book, DIVINE GUIDANCE.  Virtue describes how to discern true guidance when we receive it, and provides examples of how to know it when we've got it.  I especially love the real-life stories Virtue includes, because they help bring her ideas of talking to God and angels to life -- and sometimes they describe what happened on occasions when divine messages have been ignored!<br />DIVINE GUIDANCE provides three steps for formulating questions, and four steps to start seeing angels around every person we meet.  Virtue also provides side-by-side examples of spiritual messages with the less-helpful lower-self messages, as well as a table showing characteristics of true and false guidance.  The main emphasis of this book is to help people develop and enhance their &quot;clairs&quot;... clairaudience, clairvoyance, clairsentience, and claircognizance... because such expanded awareness opens our ability to clearly hear, see, feel and know what is real around us.  Lots of fun and easy exercises (such as toning) are included, as well as some very helpful prayers.<br />DIVINE GUIDANCE is for people of all faiths, races, ages, and nationalities.  People who are interested in discovering and fulfilling their life mission will enjoy this book more, simply because messages of divine guidance tend to urge us to make a positive contribution to the world.	2001-06-07

For example, Schmicker cites the work of researchers like Kenneth Batcheldor, who has identified two blocks to PK production (ownership resistance and witness inhibition).  I find it just as interesting to examine the reasons why people find the subject of the paranormal disquieting as it is to see such a thorough review of the evidence showing how psi is a real phenomena which simply won't go away.<br />If you've ever wanted to tell your friends, colleagues and family that there is an ever-increasing body of scientific evidence proving that the paranormal is part of everyday life, this is the book for you!	2001-05-25

Braden covers some big ideas in THE ISAIAH EFFECT, including:  how ancient spiritual writings have been removed and/or altered in much of our modern western education; the tremendous significance that those ancient writings have for us today; and how these teachings explain ways that we can rediscover how to choose the outcomes and possibilities in our life.  Braden takes us on an exciting spiritual adventure to Egypt, Tibet, Peru, and the American southwest as he ponders these questions and shares his epiphanies along the way.<br />I find the single most powerful section in THE ISAIAH EFFECT to be Braden's explanation of how to regain the lost language of prayer by learning to align one's thoughts, feelings, and emotions.  This &quot;fifth mode of prayer&quot; is not anything like the more common categories of prayer noted by prayer researchers (Colloquial, Petitionary, Ritualistic, Meditative).  Those of us who have experienced times of being at one with everything will be thrilled to see this way of praying being adequately described in some detail.<br />I am also fascinated by Braden's assertion that several different religions and cultures describe prophecies of apolocalypse side-by-side with an alternative path of peace and cooperation.  Both possibilities may seem to be contradictory, yet they are likely helping to show us how we can actively participate in selecting the future we prefer.<br />This book renews my sense of optimism that together, people of Earth can join in prayer to make a choice between greed, comfort and profit... or love, strength, and balance.	2001-05-19

His deceptively simple book touches my heart so deeply that I find tears of love and joy spontaneously welling up in my eyes as I read it.  Grossman's loving view of this world shines right through every word of this beautifully illustrated book, as he describes how to:  feel and share energy with Nature, feel more Love in one's life, develop one's skills as a Healer, and do a most remarkable set of Exercises.<br />Grossman begins TO BE HEALED BY THE EARTH by describing how he returned home early from a vacation to Brazil in 1987 feeling desperately ill.  His doctor told him a parasite had laid its eggs in his liver and he had one week left to live... and sent him home to die.  Instead of dying, Grossman felt inspired to lie down on the Earth every day, which began a transformation within him.  When he found himself healthy again, he noticed he was seeing light coming from all living organisms -- including in his psychotherapy patients.<br />I began to practice some of the exercises with some trepidation, since I have allergies and many pollens were blowing about this spring.  I found much to my surprise that my allergies and asthma vanished completely as I practiced these exercises on a daily basis... and this was in the height of one of the worst allergy seasons ever!<br />I give this book my highest recommendation to anyone interested in improving their skills as a healer, as well as to anyone who simply wishes they had more energy, better health, and/or a more loving relationship with others in their life.	2001-05-19

Many of us receive early warning signs of troubled relationships and problems with our health, yet find it difficult to recognize and heed the wisdom we have access to.  If you've ever wondered how to differentiate between hearing true inner guidance and suffering from an over-active imagination, this book is for you!  Orloff also provides invaluable tips for how to get clear intuitive &quot;reads&quot; in the most trying times and challenging situations.<br />One of the things that impressed me most about INTUITIVE HEALING is Orloff's courage to present the advantages of psychic intuition directly to the medical community, in a culture that historically has denigrated all things psychic.  Orloff builds a crystal-clear case for the value of intuition, which often is the best (and sometimes the only) source of accurate and timely information in life-or-death situations.  Orloff describes how we need not fear death, but can learn to access tremendous reserves of strength by welcoming the energy of death into our lives and learning to better understand death on an intuitive level.<br />INTUITIVE HEALING is priceless for anyone in need of medical care, and equally valuable to those who simply desire to develop intuitive abilities.  I give this book my highest recommendation!	2001-05-07

Author Rebecca Holdorf explains that the Hermit is \\"the Wise One isolated by choice who speaks only when properly addressed:  when the mind is silent.\\"  Holdorf shares relevant stories from her life as she addresses some of the big questions, such as:  the search for meaning in life; increasing awareness of ourselves; relating to others; and such soulful abstractions as truth, beauty, love, compassion and freedom.  What I love most about HONORING THE HERMIT is the way it brings clarity to the matter of how to be a soulful individual, honoring both one's own life path and all life, everywhere.  I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to gain a better understanding of the interaction between self and spirit.	2001-05-04

Although I read it for the first time in April 2001 (the original 1978 first edition version), I was thoroughly impressed with the way Gawain can write such a practical guide to the process of how we create our lives from our thoughts and feelings.<br />Gawain includes many exercises which help readers learn how to relax, how to visualize, contact their higher selves, program prosperity, heal themselves and others, meditate, and state meaningful affirmations.  I especially enjoyed her &quot;pink bubble&quot; manifestation meditation for bringing what you most desire to you.<br />I feel very at home with the exercises and techniques outlined in CREATIVE VISUALIZATION, and highly recommend it to anyone interested in transforming their life for the better.	2001-04-04

DREAMING THE FUTURE succeeds on many levels; it contains one of the most complete assortments of divination methods ever brought together in one book, it describes fascinating accounts of how divination and prophets have changed history, and it provides the reader with many useful do-it-yourself guides to try divination techniques at home.<br />DREAMING THE FUTURE is an entertaining and educational read whether you are actively involved with divination methods, are simply interested to know more about them and how they've been used, or are downright skeptical that such things could have any accuracy whatsoever. Pickover frequently refers to himself as being a skeptic throughout this book, yet he does not fall victim to scientism -- the belief that scientific hypotheses are immutable &quot;laws&quot;, rather than ever-changing theories. Pickover requests that people first rule out the ways we can be tricked, to avoid blindly accepting assertions of paranormal or mystical experience.<br />I particularly enjoyed reading about the wide variety of oracles involving animal behavior, dowsing, candle flames, numerology, automatic writing, cheese shapes, tea leaves, crystals, breathing over a vase of water, sounds and movements of the wind, sand, geomancy, feng shui, fortune cookies, and random remarks overheard in crowds. I finished reading this book feeling inspired to try out new kinds of divination methods that weren't even mentioned, because I regained the sense that we can receive spiritual information from all of our senses in every situation, everywhere, all the time.	2001-03-29

Author Don Miguel Ruiz presents us with four simple concepts from ancient Toltec wisdom which can free us from illusion in his elegant book, THE FOUR AGREEMENTS:  be impeccable with your word, don't take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and always do your best.<br />Ruiz explains how the very beliefs we are raised with usually get in our way of being who we truly are, and helps us learn to master our emotions so we may better navigate our way through the twists and turns of our lives.  The four agreements illustrate better ways to relate to others with genuine love and compassion, while not sacrificing our integrity to ourselves and our spirit in the process.<br />Deceptively simple to read, this book has sufficient depth and power to inspire us to become the masters of our destiny, courageously living each day to the fullest, free from fear of being judged or victimized.  I agree with Ruiz that all who implement these four agreements will live a life of Heaven on Earth... and I am awed that such a small book can deliver so much.	2001-03-13

Each tale takes the reader one step further on a journey of introspective self-actualization in which relationships with one's ego and spirit are explored a little bit at a time. The book is deceptively simple to read, yet contains great depth which is ideal fodder for meditation. Zukav's SOUL STORIES are memorable tales of love, loss, and renewal in which the mysterious ways that spirit acts in our lives become just a bit more clear. Zukav does not preach any particular religion as he advocates that we aspire to reach our highest spiritual potential. In addition to the dozens of emotionally moving stories, Zukav gives advice such as &quot;Spiritual partners look inside themselves -- and not at each other -- when they get angry, frightened, or sad.&quot; I could feel my heart breaking open with love and inspiration as I read each of these stories. These stories touch the heart and soul, and give us much to contemplate long after we've finished the last page.	2001-03-02

Author John Perkins takes us with him on an amazing journey to comprehend the methods used by shamen around the world to vanish and reappear, transform into plants and animals, heal seemingly inoperable medical conditions, and travel through space and time.  He tells fascinating stories of how he overcame his initial skepticism and doubt to became one with a chair, transform herbs into a newspaper, and travel through time and space as a blue ball of light.  Perkins describes a method for discerning between creating something of lasting value (dream), and creating something of transitory relevance (fantasy).  SHAPESHIFTING also details a powerful technique for taking a dream that you wish to manifest, focusing on it with your mind and heart, energizing it, and releasing it.

MIND MEDICINE begins without assuming that the reader already has prior knowledge of this subject.  Almost every page of this book is graced with beautiful pictures, interesting charts, and fascinating quotations that are relevant to the topic being discussed.  Luscious illustrations supplement the elegant simplicity of this wonderfully informative text in such a way that the reader's mind is fully engaged while reading.<br />The premise of Mind Medicine is that we can and do affect our health with our lifestyles and attitudes... which we can change.  Geller advocates judicious use of modern medicine in conjunction with the healing powers of our minds, yet points out that most of us do not fully harness our own healing abilities.  We are healthiest when we feel loved and happy -- and this joyous, light energy attracts more good things and people to us.  Geller invites us to contemplate what makes us happy, and how free we are to change.<br />This book is written so simply and clearly that I envision it being a text book for children or adults who wish to learn how to discover what Uri Geller calls MindPower... the higher powers that allow him to bend spoons, locate hidden things, and affect things from a distance.  Geller makes his irresistible invitation to us crystal-clear in the introduction to his book, &quot;The mind of every one of us possesses an unimaginable gift and you are about to learn how to use it.

Next, let's imagine how this very consciousness of the universe creates the physical world around us.  Goswami further asserts that we are all part of THE SELF-AWARE UNIVERSE, and shows us how to lift the veil of material monism that tends to obstruct our ability to peer into the cosmic mind.<br />Goswami utilizes findings from recent experiments in quantum physics to provide ample evidence of his assertion that old assumptions based on material monism are out-dated and no longer valid.  Goswami points out that:  we live in a non-local universe, where everything is interconnected to everything else at the most fundamental level; we cannot hope to observe anything without affecting what we are observing; we can only predict the outcome of events in probabilities (not certainties); and there is something much more to this universe than just the matter and energy we can measure.<br />With a brilliant mind and warm heart, Goswami guides the reader on a wonderful journey.  We discover objects that exist in two places at once, effects that precede their causes, the implications of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and the Schrodinger's cat thought experiment, and the fascinating world of paradoxes and tangled hierarchies.<br />At the end of this journey, we find ourselves wondering who we truly are.  Goswami writes, &quot;the self of our self-reference is due to a tangled hierarchy, but our consciousness is the consciousness of our Being that is beyond the subject-object split.  There is no other source of consciousness in the universe.  The self of self-reference and the consciousness of the original consciousness, together, make what we call self-consciousness.&quot;<br />I highly recommend this enchanting book!	2001-01-30

There is an energy to miracles, as Spangler describes the steps he has found to be most effective at &quot;transforming a wave of possibility into a particle of actuality&quot;.  This book provides excellent tools for anyone who feels a need to focus their manifestation powers more clearly, and even includes a chapter of how to overcome difficulties that people commonly encounter with their manifestations.<br />Spangler shares fascinating true manifestation stories, and reminds us that we have all experienced manifestation in our lives.  Often we think of these moments when our wishes and dreams came true as synchronicities -- yet there is truly an art of manifestation,  of &quot;changing and fine-tuning the web of relationship and interconnection&quot; -- and Spangler is the perfect guide to show us how to refine our manifestation techniques for more beautiful and enjoyable results.<br />Spangler's manifestation fitness program focuses on maintaining a healthy body, finding our rhythm, recognizing limits, focusing on the present moment, forgiving, keeping a sense of wonder, allowing for possibilities, positive thinking, gratitude, spirituality, and compassion.  He provides useful and easy-to-do visualization exercises that help us understand how to understand the way we are creating, and begin to bring more of what we most desire into our lives.  Manifestation rituals, such as &quot;boiling reality&quot; are described in detail, so that even complete novices can successfully achieve good manifestation results.  Numerous exercises, such as &quot;welcoming the new you with love&quot;, and &quot;projecting the light of your will&quot; are provided throughout the book, giving the reader ample opportunity to practice the techniques as they are being described.	2001-01-29

I consider it to be author Michael Talbot's most important work, as well as one of the best books ever written on the subject of so-called paranormal phenomena.<br /><br />Talbot's fascination for finding scientific explanations for psychic and paranormal activity began when he noticed objects moving inexplicably around him, regardless where he lived.  He would sometimes awaken to find socks draped on his houseplants, and occasionally found objects in his apartment that he knew for a fact had been hundreds of miles away.  His real-life experiences with such shifts in reality combined with his training in physics led him to explore possible reasons for these and other mysterious happenings.<br /><br />Talbot begins his book with an excellent introduction to physicist David Bohm's concept of the holographic model of the universe, and combines the physics model with Karl Pribram's work on the holographic model of the brain.  The result is a marvelous description of a non-local, interconnected and alive universe that moves in response to our every thought and feeling.<br /><br />I am very impressed with the clarity with which Talbot presents the concept of a holographic universe and how various paranormal phenomena can be explained within that model.  Talbot's discussion is comprehensive, fascinating, clear, and packed with relevant and intriguing stories of paranormal phenomena.  Out of body experiences (OBEs), near death experiences (NDEs), auric readings, psychokinesis, acupuncture, X-ray vision, healing, and psychic readings are all described and considered for placement into the holographic model.<br /><br />Talbot presents a wealth of relevant research studies and scientific theories from David Bohm, Helmut Schmidt, Marilyn Schlitz, Robert Monroe, Charles Tart, Larry Dossey, Paul Davies, PMH Atwater, Ian Stevenson, Fred Alan Wolf, Harold Puthoff, Russell Targ, Lyall Watson, Stanislav Grof, and many others., Lyall Watson, Stanislav Grof, and many others.	2001-01-25

Relationship counselors Joyce and Barry Vissell had a similar vision when they collected dozens of true love stories for their heart-warming book, MEANT TO BE.<br />The Vissells begin this book with the assertion that &quot;there is a miraculous love story within each person&quot;, and describe that their greatest hope for readers of this book is &quot;to inspire you to live more fully every moment, to love and appreciate now the ones with whom you are in relationship, rather than putting it off into the uncertain future.&quot;  MEANT TO BE succeeds brilliantly at both showing us the way love orchestrates our lives, and also pointing out the value of being fully present in our relationships right now.<br />I found myself feeling uplifted and amazed by the synchronicities and astonishing ways that peoples' lives in these stories arranged themselves so that they would take note of someone special -- even when they were not trying or even feeling like meeting anyone new.  The common thread in all these stories was the desire of those involved to deeply love another, and yet each story is completely unique.  I was deeply touched that the authors themselves participated in sharing the ups and downs of their love stories... each from their own point of view.<br />This would be a wonderful book if it only contained stories of how people met, but it goes far beyond that to share stories of how lovers can help each other grow and heal, and how love never ends... even when our lovers die.  If you are ready to read a book that will break your heart open with a feeling of love so great it cannot be contained, MEANT TO BE is meant for you.	2001-01-15

All you'll need to begin your adventures is to read a copy of Robert Bruce's excellent book, &quot;Astral Dynamics&quot;.<br />Astral Dynamics may well be the best guidebook to astral projection (also known as out-of-body experience, or OBE) you'll ever read.  Not only does Bruce take the reader through a step-by-step process (complete with pictures) of how to energize one's astral body and successfully master the core skills of astral projection, but he also includes delightful first-person accounts of what it feels like to travel out of body.<br />Bruce's book helps you learn how to achieve deep physical relaxation, tame your mind, and achieve a trance state before mastering the art of projecting your &quot;etheric double&quot;.  Bruce provides invaluable pointers such as keeping the first projections ultrashort, so that they can be remembered, and ignoring noises and other distracting hallucinations just prior to out-of-body travel.<br />I am especially impressed with Bruce's descriptions of common difficulties encountered by astral travelers, such as waking paralysis, spontaneous projection, getting stuck to one's body during exit, exit cramping or pain, saliva problems, and disorientation, among other things.<br />I love the way Bruce covers much more than just the basics of astral travel.  He differentiates lucid dreaming from astral projection, and describes the technique of virtual reality projection whereby &quot;the subconscious mind can be tricked into creating custom-made virtual realms&quot; such as finding oneself inside the virtual world of a painting in the wall.  Bruce also devotes chapters to the Akashic planes as well as what he calls &quot;strange astral phenomena&quot; such as reality fluctuations, melting body parts, vision reversal, OBE hitch-hikers and astral beings.<br />Astral Dynamics is a first-rate reference book that I love to come back to again and again.s, melting body parts, vision reversal, OBE hitch-hikers and astral beings.  <br />Astral Dynamics is a first-rate reference book that I love to come back to again and again.	2001-01-08

Author PMH Atwater is fully qualified to examine this phenomenon, since she experienced three near death episodes in 1977 and has been seriously studying the phenomenon since 1978.<br />I love the way this book is organized into sections that help clarify the NDE.  Different types of near death experiences are described in detail, along with the differences between adult and child experiences.  Common after-effects such as enhanced psychic abilities, transformations of consciousness, and altered views of reality are also described in detail.<br />This book is fun to read, because almost every page contains an interesting tidbit of information pertaining to near-death experiences.  I am intrigued that the vast majority (80 to 90 percent) of near death experiencers report looking and acting younger, feeling substantially more energetic, becoming increasingly sensitive to sound and light, feeling much less boredom, regarding things as new even when they're not, and healing wounds much more quickly.<br />This is a great reference book because it's easy to understand, contains numerous near death experience stories, and summarizes current research in the field clearly and succinctly.	2001-01-08

Judy and Bill Guggenheim answer this question from the point of view of people who assert that their loved ones have died and then contacted them after death.  The Guggenheims present an amazingly convincing case that consciousness continues after death, and that such communications happen frequently.  HELLO FROM HEAVEN is packed with amazing stories of ordinary people who have received unmistakable messages from their deceased loved ones, sometimes many years after death.<br />Bill and Judy have done a superlative job of compiling the most comprehensive and organized collection of After Death Communications (ADCs) that I have ever seen in one book.  After collecting more than 3,300 first-hand accounts of ADCs, the Guggenheims discovered that the dead can contact us with fragrances, touch, appearances, visions, dreams, rainbows, butterflies, and even the occasional phone call.  These communications often contain reassurances that the deceased are doing very well, and need not be worried about.  They can also provide help to the living, such as averting suicides.<br />HELLO FROM HEAVEN provides great solace to those who have lost loved ones or have concerns about dying, since it is brimming with real-life, first-hand accounts of communications between the living and dead.  For anyone who has seen or heard the dead and thought, &quot;I must be imagining things - that couldn't have happened&quot;, this book also provides reassurance that you're not going crazy.

Into Real Consciousness	This excellent meditation guide book is written in the form of a one-day seminar that Charles Tart conducted for the University of Arizona's &quot;Toward a Science of Consciousness&quot; meeting in Tucson in 1998.  While there are many books written on the subject of what meditation is and how to go about meditating, few can match the hands-on feeling of being in a meditation class that this book offers.<br />Right from the beginning, this book grabbed my attention by describing the differences between scientism (the tendency to consider scientific theories to be &quot;laws&quot;) and open-minded, objective science.  By pointing out this as well as other common habitual thinking traps we often fall into, Tart's book helps the reader learn to recognize the way we can become aware of our mechanical, habitual thought patterns.<br />Tart clearly describes concentrative meditation and opening-up meditation (aka &quot;vipassana&quot;) techniques in a straightforward manner that is easy enough for beginners to put into immediate practice.  I was glad to see that questions and answers that arose in the workshop were included in this book, because they often addressed the same concerns that were going through my mind as I tried out each meditative technique.<br />As an extra bonus, Tart's book describes the range of states of consciousness we experience, and how we can awaken from the sleep of ordinary consciousness where we are primarily reacting to external stimuli.  Tart has a real talent for illuminating the highlights in consciousness research, and sharing some of the most important findings in simple language.  Tart's down-to-Earth practicality is his great gift as a writer -- he brings complex issues into clear focus without losing the main ideas along the way.<br />If you've been waiting until an easy-to-understand yet comprehensive meditation book came along, you're in luck.

His latest book, MIND INTO MATTER, is a masterpiece of insight into the hidden workings of our magical, mysterious universe. As I read this book, I felt exhilarated to join Wolf on his journey &quot;to find our mind&quot; on the frontier of the imaginal and the real.<br />MIND INTO MATTER is structured around Wolf's explanation of the significance and meaning behind the first nine letter-symbols in the Hebrew alphabet, with a separate chapter devoted to each Hebrew letter. The book begins with the concept of Spirit within the Void, and continues onward to Creation, Animation, Resistance, Vitality, Replication, Chance, Unification, and Structure. We witness the new alchemy at work in the process of Animation, where we notice how we Think, Feel, Sense, and Intuit the world around us.<br />I love Wolf's playful way of describing thought experiments throughout his book, alongside fascinating research material from physicists and neurophysiological researchers that suggest how our conscious minds form memories of events. On a deep level, we are aware of all possibilities available to us, and the one we remember as being real is the one we choose to observe.  Since information flows from the future to our present time, we have what we need to select the path we most desire.<br />To everyone who wishes to more fully grasp the breadth, depth, and height of who we truly are and how we interact with the universe, I give this book my highest recommendation.	2000-11-14

Ted Owens achieved great fame and notoriety in the 1970's for accurately predicting numerous earthquakes, vehicle crashes (including the space shuttle Challenger), weather changes, sporting event outcomes, UFO appearances, and power outages, among other things.  Ted considered himself to have psychokinetic (PK) abilities conferred upon him by what he called &quot;the space intelligences&quot;, although he often had difficulty convincing skeptical journalists and scientists of his powers.<br />I love the way Dr. Jeffrey Mishlove methodically examines each example of Ted Owens' PK demonstrations in THE PK MAN, in order to determine the validity of Mr. Owens' claim that he was using psychokinetic (not precognitive or clairvoyant) powers.  While Ted's PK powers were not 100% fool-proof, many of his predictions for unlikely events (such as a drought in Florida in the rainy season) came true, and his mere presence often seemed to trigger earth-changing events (such as the eruption of Mt. Saint Helens).<br />THE PK MAN fascinated me with its colorful descriptions of UFO manifestations, Ted Owen's vengeful PK attacks on those who doubted and discredited him, and the highlights from Ted Owens' PK training classes.  Ted Owens' hypnotic trance suggestions were designed to greatly increase one's mental, emotional, physical and spiritual (including psychokinetic) powers... as well as help people contact extra-terrestrials... and they are included in their entirety in a chapter towards the end of the book.	2000-11-13

If so, you'll be delighted to read Bonnie Kelley Kaback's autobiographical book, &quot;Tinkerbell Jerusalem&quot;.<br />Kaback's life has been filled with unexpected challenges ever since she was nine years old, when her idyllic home life began to splinter apart.  Kaback describes how she managed to find sparkles of love and joy in spite of the hardships she encountered as things didn't go the way she'd hoped and expected.<br />There is a special kind of magic that Kaback describes which has the power to transform our feelings from sorrow to joy, from anger and fear to laughter and love.  Kaback coins a term for this magic as &quot;inbetweens&quot; to describe those special memories or experiences that help us find our way to living a more fulfilling life.  These &quot;little things&quot; are catalysts that can and do transform the world when we respond to others with love, rather than reacting from fear or anger.  Even very old pain from injury, divorces, and parental alcoholism can be healed, as Kaback so beautifully describes.<br />Her prose is written with rare eloquence, which makes her story a joy to read from beginning to end.  If you're at all sentimental, I recommend that you read this book with a box of Kleenex.  It will touch your heart, and leave you feeling a renewed connection to everything you love most in this world.	2000-11-08

While we know from the start where this love story will end, we don't know how two people from such different walks of life who don't know one another can recognize each other after their first chance meeting.<br />Told alternately from Donna's and Alan's point of view, this story demonstrates the way synchronicity operates in real life.  Donna enters the story as an experienced healer, energy worker, and dream interpreter who is learning to better understand how to communicate with spirit.  Alan just begins to discover these things as he witnesses first-hand the way Donna's waking dreams have real-life significance, and begins to find meaning in coincidental happenings in his life as well.  Both Donna and Alan discover a deeper sense of love and connection between each other and all that is, as they learn to trust their hearts and spirits to guide their lives.<br />When I meet couples for the first time, I almost always ask them, &quot;How did you two get together?&quot;, because I love to glimpse the way the spirit behind physical things pulls us closer to those we need at just the right time in our life.  &quot;Eyes of Sophia&quot; shares these gifts of spirit with us as it opens and reveals a world of interpreting dream symbols, physical pain in our bodies, coincidences and synchronicities.  This book shows how even the occasional disappointments and set-backs along the way have meaning, and are part of the grand design of life.  I love the way this book effectively demonstrates how the more closely we observe the details (names, articles, dates, songs), the more meaningful our own life story can become.  Donna May and Alan Chien's autobiographical tale is exactly the kind of sign-post people need to find the spiritual meaning behind coincidences in their lives, and learn how to live a dream-come-true.	2000-11-07

Some of this nervousness fades with time and experience, but if you read  this book you'll have a definite advantage -- you'll be prepared!<br />I  read this book in order to improve my public speaking skills, and I have  found it to be consistently informative, helpful, clear, and inspirational.  This book is most useful for those who have very little public speaking  experience, and it provides guidelines for determining the purpose of your  talk, giving some thought to who your audience will be, doing research,  supporting your ideas, organizing the talk, and keeping the audience's  interest while you're talking.  I especially love the sample speeches  provided in this book, and the side-bars for illustrating key concepts and  ideas.<br />Anyone planning to speak in public will benefit from reading  this book as they prepare!	2000-05-31

Tulku's greatest gift is his ability to clearly communicate techniques for meditation and mindful living that came from his Tibetan Buddhist  experience.  Tulku conveys fascinating ideas in simple terms which can be  readily applied in anyone's life, regardless of spiritual or religious  orientation -- or even what kind of work you do!<br />Most of Tulku's books  contain wonderful exercises to practice the concepts he describes, and this  book is no exception. For example, the very first chapter describing Inner  Freedom offers three ways to practice improving clarity, concentration, and  mindfulness.  The patterns of success that Tulku discusses in great detail  in this book have to do with self awareness, coping with change, and  sharing with others.  Long before anyone heard the term &quot;emotional  intelligence&quot;, Tulku was practicing and teaching it.<br />Just reading  Tulku's writing improves my facilities for meditation and mindfulness, by  focusing my attention on the process of thought itself.  It's always a joy  for me to read anything written by this master of consciousness!	2000-05-26

Each of the fourteen SHAPE SHIFTERS in this book is a woman shaman who sets a living example of health, balance, and integrity.  These stories are uplifting, since most of these women experienced very deep trauma at some  time in their lives from which they emerged stronger, wiser, and with gifts  (such as healing, creativity, enhanced multisensory perception, and other  psychic talents).<br />There is a resurgence now of shamanic women, who  typically were aware from childhood of a subtle world of energy that became  increasingly important in their lives as they matured.  You may have heard  of some of the women interviewed for this book; they include Joan Halifax,  Lynn Andrews, Luisah Teish, Tsultrim Allione, Rowena Pattee, Ruth-Inge  Heinze, Larissa Vilenskaya, Petey Stevens, Vicki Noble, Starhawk, J. Ruth  Strock, Sandy Ingerman, Susan Eger Valadez, and Brooke Medicine Eagle.<br />Author Michele Jamal selected these women as modern-day examples of  living a shamanic life in order to share both their inspirational stories  and the underlying goal of helping to change a destructive global direction  to one that is life oriented, while we still have time and space to do  so.<br />I love this book so much that I keep coming back to read it again,  and I give it my highest recommendation!	2000-05-16

The incoming negativity can contribute to illnesses, accidents, and all sorts of &quot;bad luck&quot;.  If you have felt loss of strength and energy,  depression, dullness of the mind and senses, pains in your body, quick  temper, loss of appetite.... you might have experienced a psychic attack.<br />Dr. Bruce Goldberg explains how the vast majority of psychic attacks  come from general negativity in the universe (such as from news stories and  advertisements), and the next most common cause of psychic attack (about  7%) is from discarnate entities, or ghosts.  About 3% of psychic attacks  are intentionally caused by people, and less than 1% is attributable to  demonic entities.  Dr. Goldberg believes that all suicides are the result  of psychic attacks.<br />Fortunately, there are things we can do to protect  ourselves and those we love from this barrage of negativity!  Just as we  can keep our skin clean and strong to defend our physical body from  bacterial infection, Goldberg asserts that we can prevent the piercing of  our aura using the techniques he outlines in this book.  There is one  chapter containing basic techniques and another with advanced techniques  for psychic self-defense.<br />Dr. Goldberg's experience with 11,000  hypnotherapy clients over 24 years led to his writing this book -- which is  the most thorough treatment of the subject of psychic self-defense I've  ever seen.  This book is useful for anyone interested in maintaining their  health and sanity as they expand their psychic awareness... or anyone  interested in a deeper understanding of what's going on.<br />I highly  recommend this book!	2000-05-15

I love the way it points out the value of adversity in our lives that is so often overlooked, finding hope in the darkest nights of our souls.  Yes, even when things seem to be going  terribly, terribly wrong... there is tremendous value in finding the gifts  that Hope brings us in these trying times.<br />One of the greatest powers  of Hope is that it gives us the courage to open our eyes and see our lives  clearly when crises appear.  It does this by helping us grow in ways we  could never have guessed.  Hope also helps us by allowing us to find and  feel compassion for ourself and others... and by leading us to spiritual  awakening.<br />Lamm draws on his lifetime of work as a religious counselor  serving all faiths to present fascinating true stories of the power of hope  in people's lives.  It helps that some of Lamm's friends are fascinating  people, too -- like Alan Alda, Nobel prize-winner Elie Wiesel, author  Harold Kushner, and Shari Lewis!<br />I especially love Lamm's ten point plan  that turns hope into reality... he clearly describes in practical terms the  things we can do to have the courage to live true to our inspiration and  dreams.	2000-05-14

At their first meeting, Solovine explained that he was  &quot;studying philosophy, but wanted to delve into physics so as to  acquire a thorough understanding of nature&quot;.  On the third day of  their meetings, Einstein told Solovine,  &quot;As a matter of fact, you  don't have to be tutored in physics; our discussion of problems that stem  from it is much more interesting.  Just come to see me and I will be glad  to talk with you.&quot;  Thus began the long friendship of Maurice Solovine  and Albert Einstein -- and this book is a compilation of many letters from  Einstein to Solovine, with photocopies of the German originals and  translations to English following.  While physicists may be somewhat  disappointed to find that these letters to Solovine contain very little  discussion of physics, most fans of Einstein will be enchanted to see him  express his feelings about his family, his work, his peers, and politics.	2000-05-07

Wolf sets out to show how the self is fundamentally an illusion, &quot;arising as a  reflection of the soul in matter much as a clear lake at midnight reflects  the moon.&quot;  Wolf begins this book with descriptions of Aristotlian and  Platonic Soul Physics... and then continues the quest for knowledge of the  soul through ancient Egypt and ancient Chaldea, and onward through more  modern history.  Wolf shares his vision of the soul as a process rather  than some &quot;thing&quot; measurable in terms of mechanical materiality  -- drawing from Qabalistic, Buddhist, and Christian wisdom as well as a  thorough understanding of physics to redefine spirit, soul, matter and  self. I found this entire book to be deeply thought-provoking, with Wolf's  characteristic playful humor entertaining me throughout. I especially  enjoyed the section of THE SPIRITUAL UNIVERSE that described the importance  of secret knowledge, and why it is sacred -- thereby showing us the physics  of faith.	2000-05-07

As Dossey explains, &quot;If non-local mind is a  reality, the world becomes a place of interaction and connection, not one  of isolation and disjunction.  And if humanity really believed that  non-local mind were real, an entirely new foundation for ethical and moral  behavior would enter, which would hold at least the possibility of a  radical departure from the insane ways human beings and nation-states have  chronically behaved toward each other.&quot;  Dossey delves into ideas put  forward by Schrodinger, Godel, Einstein, Margenau, and Bohm -- before  moving into the spiritual implications of non-local mind.  I highly  recommend this book as an excellent starting point for understanding the  concept of &quot;one mind&quot;, and for considering the implications this  has in our lives.	2000-05-07

The idea is to learn to  &quot;cardiocontemplate&quot;, as Paul Pearsall playfully puts it, in order  that our heart can &quot;have its way rather than allowing your brain to  busy you with trying to get its way&quot;.  Pearsall describes the  characteristics of mature wishers as being persistently patient,  harmoniously connected, pleasantly agreeable, modestly humble, and kindly  tender -- in other words, loving in five different ways.  One of my  favorite sections in Pearsall's book is his concept of the &quot;Wish  Star&quot;, where we can focus on the five key domains of what we are  wishing for -- such as serenity, compassion, meaning, purpose, and delight  (along with the darker realms of turmoil, loneliness, despair, stagnation,  and disillusionment).

Within the framework of an imaginary conversation between &quot;Thomas&quot; (based on Thomas Berry)  and &quot;Youth&quot; (representing youthful mankind), Brian Swimme's  UNIVERSE IS A GREEN DRAGON tells the miraculous story of the vibrant  existance of our universe.  In masterful storytelling style, Swimme spins a  tale so poetic and electrifying that the story inside this book begins to  seem much more real than much of the rest of &quot;real life&quot;.  As  Thomas explains to the Youth, &quot;To develop the power of cosmic  sensitivity is to understand that to be in reality means dissolving the  universe, absorbing it into your new self.  To be is to dissolve and draw  up, to BE dissolved and drawn up.  The universe is a hard yellow candy, to  be sucked on and swalled until it dissolves, and, in that moment of  dissolution, we emerge.  A hardened mind cannot respond to the presence of  the moon.  The moon's riches cannot be tasted, so the moon can not show  itself.  The interaction between the rigid person and the universe is  superficial, because the sensitivity is dim.&quot;  I feel invigorated  after reading any part of this book... refreshed with a new vision of the  true splendour of this enchanted universe.	2000-04-27

Strauch suggests exercises to do by  yourself and or with a friend to demonstrate the way our physical strength  and health are altered as we change the focus of our attention.  This book  has excellent illustrations throughout, and is an excellent guidebook for  examining our forms of perception.	2000-04-26

I find myself frequently referring to it in conversations about how fast things seem to be changing these days.  I was moved by the wisdom  I gleaned in these melodic passages -- and impressed at how Russell can  convey such intense feeling and truth in so few words.  Difficult and  challenging issues are presented and discussed with clarity that provides  just the right amount of tension, just as the most beautiful music creates  moments of stress which are then relieved with passages of exceptional  grace.  Rare is the book that can aim to briefly summarize such topics as  Materialism, Fear, Stress, Enlightenment, Meditation and Love... and  succeed to touch one's heart, mind and soul so completely without ever  hitting a sour note.  I give this masterpiece of a book my highest  recommendation for anyone interested in discovering what they can do to  make their life (and life for all of us) the very best it can be.	2000-04-26

As Dr. Dossey reminds us,  \\"It is not man who is at the mercy of an external `real' time -- it is time  itself which is shaped by man.\\"  Since the effects of urgency can bring  illness upon us, this book is a welcome guide to finding our way back to a  healthier perception of space and time.  Dossey explains how absorbing  activities like fishing or needlepoint can help us kill the relentless push  of time, and bring us to the healing perception of infinite space and time.	2000-04-26

The creators of these beautiful cards and companion reference book succeeded at combining elements from many wisdom traditions into the most meaningful divination  deck and book I've yet encountered.  Bravo!  It's rare to find a work of  such beauty, grace and wisdom that is so useful and practical.  Of the  three tarot decks I've used, this one is the very best.  I've used this  deck with friends who've worked with many different decks, and they agree  that Shapeshifter is the most sensitive and information-packed.  The deck  is extremely easy to work with, since the basic meaning of each card  appears on the front of the card.  In addition to the regular cards one  finds in a tarot deck, this deck contains three new major arcana cards (the  Double, the Journey, and the Dreamer), which I found to be some of the most  interesting and useful cards in the deck.  Unless you are already familiar  with a traditional tarot deck that you feel comfortable with, I'm sure  you'll enjoy and probably even prefer this deck.  Obviously, any divination  tools will work (even stones or tortoise shells), but an outstanding tarot  deck like Shapeshifter sets itself apart from all the rest with elegance  and eloquence; it's simply in a class by itself.	2000-04-26

Biologist Lyall Watson travels to Indonesia in search of magic... and finds a 'dancing island' and a girl who comes of age to become a shaman and healer.  For those who simply enjoy a good story, this is an excellent  book.  For those who realize that the magic described in this book is real,  it's even better.  Watson is a first-rate story-teller, and I would give  this book ten stars if such a thing were possible!	2000-04-26

This book's plot moves along fluidly, and its characters and setting are enchanting.  I especially love the element of uncertainty regarding the title character,  Neftoon Zamora, and that of the other main character, affectionately known  as &quot;Nez&quot;.  Michael Nesmith seems to have put much of his own  persona into this character... Nez's love of music, cars, and airplanes has  a depth that comes from living with those passions full-time.  I cared  about Nez and whether he would succeed in his quest for the mythological  Neftoon Zamora and the amazing blues music he'd heard on a cassette tape so  much that I brought this book everywhere I went while I was reading it.  I  found several passages in this book to be so entertaining that I read them  aloud to friends, and I am certain I'll be back to read this book again!  I'd also love to see it come out as a movie -- it certainly seems to have  been written with the medium of film in mind.	2000-04-26

Wolf contemplates how we might perceive these parallel universes, and what it might feel like when  we experience the past and future interacting with the present.  The extra  bonus of this adventure is that Wolf shows you how time is not the steady,  measurable thing you thought it was!  Time is slippery, because it can't  ever be directly observed.  Whereas we can measure and then verify a  measurement of length or weight repeatedly, measurements of time cannot be  easily confirmed.  As Wolf points out so succinctly, \\"Nowhere is there a  value of time associated with an observable called time.  As far as the  equations are concerned, time is just a convenient ordering parameter -- a  way of keeping track of things placed alongside each other in a sequence.\\"  Time travel may well be possible, and you might not even need a time  machine to do it!  If you love to stretch your mind to understand more of  the universe, I highly recommend this book.	2000-04-26

Watson takes care to present both the meaning and the value of each idea in this  well-illustrated book.  Concepts from many different cultures and time  periods are well represented, so this book is fun to read cover-to-cover  just for the joy of learning about various metaphysical perspectives and  practices.

Leonard George's writing is clear and down-to-Earth as he describes such esoteric topics as  ESP, telekinesis, lucid dreaming, meditation, and mystical experiences.  I  love the way each entry contains both an explanation and at least one  example, so it's easy to quickly comprehend what is being discussed.  Some  definitions go even farther, and cover the history and background of the  phenomena around the world.  This book is a delightful encyclopedia to  either read sequentially or simply as the need arises to look something up.	2000-04-26

Radin presents an excellent  scientific case for the truth of psychic phenomena, using statistics to  examine \\"psi\\" -- the phenomenon that includes the three broad categories of  anomalous phenomenon of psychokinesis (mind-matter interaction),  extra-sensory perception, and survival after bodily death.  Radin excels at  presenting memorable stories along with his clear, concise, and  comprehensible statistics in such a way that one feels compelled to either  accept or reject his findings and the implications they suggest.  This is  an excellent book for reading when you're ready to do your own thinking...  and change the way you view the world.	2000-04-26

The appendices of this book are  delightful, for they contain information on research centers and membership  organizations for parapsychology and physical research being conducted  around the world.  While this book was printed in 1991, it is still  valuable for its wealth of biographical information.	2000-04-26

Mitchell's  autobiographical book THE WAY OF THE EXPLORER describes in thrilling detail  his experiences with the Apollo missions, as well as his subsequent  exploration of the fields of consciousness and paranormal phenomenon.  Mitchell's heart-warming accounts of his feelings as he walked on the moon,  and then traveled back through space to see how \\"the heavens and earth  tumbled alternately in and out of view in the small capsule window\\" are  gracefully combined with his insightful observations of the nature of  consciousness and reality.  We can all benefit from experiencing the Earth  as Mitchell does... as one planet interconnected with each and every one of  us.  I was so moved by what Mitchell wrote about seeing Uri Geller bend  spoons and bring lost objects across space and time that it inspired me to  see Geller bend one of my (very SOLID stainless steel spoons) in person in  October 1999.  I love this book's timeless wisdom, beauty, and depth so  much that I return to it again and again.  It's a powerful book that  touches my heart and greatly inspires me!	2000-03-23

What I love most about THE MATTER MYTH is the way it  helps free our thinking from the mechanical, machine-mindedness which has  for so long dominated western thinking... as its authors eloquently assert  that materialism is dead.  The post-mechanistic paradigm is here.	2000-02-22

How would it feel to remember events from both your future and your past? PMH Atwater's book, FUTURE MEMORY presents compelling evidence and a fascinating explanation of  the future memory phenomenon, where people prelive future experiences while  still active and functional in present time. Atwater's expertise in the  field of Near Death Experiences (NDE) shines through as she shares many  stories from her personal life and guides readers through the labyrinth of  the mind and the fabric of time, space, and the universe itself. FUTURE  MEMORY masterfully balances subjective experience with relevant theories  and scientific findings, bringing the otherwise lofty material \\"down to  Earth\\" for practical applicability in daily life. We can all experience  expansive brain shifts when we experience the Void that lies at the heart  of All That Is with patience and receptivity... and can benefit  tremendously when our consciousness expands. I felt torn between devouring  this book as quickly as possible and savoring each and every page. If  you've been looking for a book that will shift your mind into higher gear,  this is it!	2000-01-16

Do we possess the power to harm others with our minds?  If so, how can we minimize the damage?  Dr. Larry Dossey answers these questions and more as he delves into the topic of the  power of prayer to cause harm in his brilliant book, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU  WISH FOR. Dossey describes how people utilize negative prayer both  consciously (in order to win at a game or in business), and unconsciously  (venting feelings and thoughts without regard for the effects on the  recipients)... and he covers a wide spectrum of negative prayers from the  sophisticated curses and hexes of sorcerers to the more common varieties of  \\"drive-by prayer\\" and \\"prayer muggings\\". Those who work with prayer every  day, such as sorcerers and priests, know better than to make idly damaging  statements such as, \\"he ought to be shot\\", or \\"I hope he chokes\\" -- and  Dossey includes some fascinating stories of how such thoughts have  precipitated real physical effects. This book is essential reading for  anyone seeking a better understanding of how to understand and protect  oneself from negative prayer, even when those prayers come from  well-meaning friends, family, and colleagues.	1999-12-23

This book is a sheer delight to read!  Brian Greene's clarity of thinking and joy of exploring the quest for the ultimate physics theory come clearly through as he describes how superstrings just might be the &quot;common  thread&quot; that runs through this universe from the tiniest quantum bits  to the largest relativistic bodies.  Are you curious to know how all these  dimensions can exist in our universe unseen?  Greene brilliantly describes  memorable analogies (such as an ant seen from a distance to be walking  along on a garden hose) that give readers a clear sense of what hidden  curled dimensions might feel like... and he writes about physics with such  grace and style!  If you've hungered to know how to better understand  hidden dimensions and superstrings, this book is guaranteed to first pique  and then satisfy your appetite.	1999-12-06

Would you like to better understand how powerful prayer really is for healing? If so,  you'll love Larry Dossey's book, &quot;Reinventing Medicine&quot;, in which  he describes this new era of non-local medicine. Dossey cites very  convincing scientific studies that indicate healing can be achieved at a  distance by directing loving thoughts, intentions and prayers to others --  even if they are not aware that these loving thoughts are being extended to  them. Dossey's revolutionary book inspires us to consider the healing power  of what he calls Eternity Medicine in our everyday lives right now. I get  goose-bumps of excitement and joy each time I read this book, and give it  my highest recommendation.	1999-11-28

This book stands out as one of the best books on shamanism I've ever seen.  The Eagle's Quest is remarkable because it maps concepts from modern physics into the ancient shamanistic world... all the while following the  Wolf's very personal true story of his quest for deeper understanding.  Because Wolf really wishes to know what's going on in the universe, his  book is thorough in its investigations of old world shamanism.  This is one  of the best books I've ever read combining spirituality and physics:  it's  full of useful information and well-written.  I love all of Fred Alan  Wolf's books, and this one is especially enjoyable to me, because it was  truly written from his heart.  This book is a classic.	1999-04-14
