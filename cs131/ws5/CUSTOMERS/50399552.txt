Fortune and Shocking Pink had better character developments and better plot twists.  I don't think she tried as hard on this one.  The two villians were not very believable.  Spindler should have spent more time developing one of them in particular.  The romance that occurs towards the end is too quick and boring.  She didn't give us much reason to root for the couple.  I was disappointed in this book.  It wasn't terrible, but I know she can do a lot better.	2002-11-03

Andie, Raven and Julie, all come from broken homes.  But their lives are turned upside down after they begin to watch a kinky couple engage in dangerous sex on a weekly basis.  The friends begin to keep secrets and lie to each other.  Each girl is effected in different ways.  The book mostly follows Andie around.  After a long string of bad books, I really enjoyed reading this one.  It's over 500 pages but I finished it quickly.  Yes, the reading is very simple and easy like Mary Higgins Clark's work.  But if you can overlook that, you'll find this book to be worth the time and effort.	2002-08-16

You get caught up in the frenzy of a town trying to find a lost girl.  George Bennett is in charge of the investigation of Alison Carter.  He finds the dark town of Scardale to be very secretive and disturbing.  Their resistance even harms his case.  The characters come to life on the page.  This is a quick read. The novel ends with all of my questions answered.  The only problem I had with the book is the summary on the back page.  I think it gives too much of the story away.  But that's probably not the writer's fault.  I would recommend this book to anyone.	2002-03-26

It is mostly photos but it does include inspirational, and interesting stories about the breed.  The photos feature goldens of all ages, shades, and sizes.  They are featured in snow, on swings, in beds and on the laps of their owners.  Each dog feautred is beautiful.  The author Dean Koontz even provides a photo of his own dog, and a chapter from one of his books, in which the main character is a Golden Retriever.  I highly reccomend this book.	2002-01-16

If I didn't know any better I would have assumed this book was Adler's first attempt at a novel.  But it isn't.  Well, the main characters are likeable enough.  I'll give her that.  Except for the alcoholic old woman.  She added nothing to the book.  The plot is weak, there is too much dialouge, and too little effort put in.  By the end of Ed's killer is revealed.  I couldn't really recall why he wanted Ed dead.  But I didn't care.  I was just happy that I was done and that I could move on to something better.

I didn't read the previous book because I didn't even know there was a prequel.  Goudge does an excellent job with her characters.  Both the females are strong, admirable, but unique.  The plot did move faster than her other books.  I will say however, that she needs to rethink her heavy reliance on setting.  Goudge spends almost three pages describing the old woman in her garden.

I currently work there.  The book covers the history, the attractions, the workers, guests, future plans, and lawsuits the park has had.  What I found to be the most interesting were the tales of guests getting out of hand.  I could definitley relate to some of the experiences.  Another wonderful chapter are the stories about rides.  You'll find out which rides are the most dangerous, the most costly, and have the most unhappy workers.  You'll find out which ride gave some lucky tourists &quot;the dirty version&quot;.  A revealing chapter is also written about the characters.  You'll read about the bodily harm they endure on a weekly basis.  The most touching part of the book talks about the day that Walt died.  The only thing I would have changed is the fact that Eisner is not discussed much at all.  I've been wanting to know more about him.  This book was written very fairly and accurately.  I would recommend this book to anybody curious about Disneyland.	2001-12-30

A weakness in some of Koontz's books has been his lack of character development.  This time he hits gold with his two main characters.  They are very well-rounded characters.  The hero is incredibly brave and sexy and yet he is quite vulnerable.  The woman is his perfect match.  The chemistry between these two is the primary reason I enjoyed this book.  The plot is exceptional.  Better than I expected.  I enjoyed trying to find out why the hero is able to save others.  The ending was satisfying.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys romance, suspense and horror.	2001-12-11

There mother has just killed their father.  She is refusing to say what happened.  She only states that it was not an accident and it was not self defense.  The sisters all have different reactions and different theories on the murder.  And all are dealing with different relationship problems of their own.  Daphne cannot forget an old flame.  Alex is struggling to raise her daughters and make peace with her ex husband.  Kitty is involved with a younger man and her quest for a baby is driving them apart.  The book explores all of this along with the murder.  Goudge is very talented in creating true to life characters and chilling scenes.  What she needs to work on is the pace of her books.  They have a tendency to be slow.  Certain scenes are given too much explanation where it is not needed.  If you can be patient, you will find this book to be a treat.  If you take note of the clues in the book you will find out why the murder took place before it is stated in the book.	2001-11-29

I honestly didn't find it to be helpful.  I was looking for examples of daily activities and routines in the hospitals.  Instead, the author uses a lot of broad statements to cover aspects of just about any asylum.  He mainly discusses the feelings and attitudes of the inmates and their caretakers.

I'm all for learning a little in a book but I felt like I was reading a history book.  There are too many characters, one very unlikable one named Katt.  And some things seem farfetched.

Hangman is about a murderer who kills all his victims by hanging them and dismembering them like the popular children's game.  I thought the plot was terrific and the twists were well crafted.  I think the idea for the book is very interesting.  When I read it I felt like I was learning but I didn't mind being educated about the legal system.  It was relevant to the plot.  I did not give the book five stories because I wished the bad guy had been someone else.  The reasoning behind the villian's murders was totally unusual and it didn't really add up.  I was pleased with the rest of it though.  This book isn't for the squemish, I should add.	2001-06-01

I can't get enough of these stories.  I can talk about them for hours.  This book explores Jory and Bart's childhood.  It is told from both perspectives.  One chapter is &quot;Jory&quot; the next, &quot;Bart&quot; and so on.  Bart is an interesting kid.  He is disrespectful to his parents (mom and uncle technicually but Chris really is a father in this story.) and insensitive to everyone around him.  He seems to genuinely be his father's (the late Bart Sr.) boy.  Bart's nerves are also not fully developed, so a spanking doesn't cause him pain.  This is also symbolic of his behavior and how he feels no guilt for his actions.  Bart becomes friends with an old woman next door who influences his behavior.  I would have liked to have seen Jory developed more.  He seems like the model child.  There isn't much more to him than a well-behaved little boy who loves his mother and loves to dance.  Cathy is still interesting in this book.  A fabulous scene in &quot;Thorns&quot; happens when Chris points out that Cathy behaved in a similar way her mother did.  This freaks Cathy out and makes her do some major soul searching.  Cathy also has a wonderful scene at the end in reaction to someone's death.  I won't say anymore for the sake of surprise.  This book is important to read if you plan on reading Seeds of Yesterday.  Also it is a good read if you are a die-hard Dollanger fan like me!	2001-04-05

He usually doesn't focus on them as much as he does the plot.  I liked Dusty Rhodes.  Dusty changed his name fully knowing that he didn't want to be taken seriously.  His mother gave him a pompous, yuppy name that just wasn't him.  Dusty has a heart of gold and he adores his wife and brother, making him very likeable.  I would have liked to see the book show more details in the element of brainwashing.  I would have liked to have seen the process of the brainwashes.  All in all though, this was an interesting book.	2001-04-04

Although this book mostly involves Bart and Jory, it is told through Cathy's point of view.  This book is the closing of the entire series.  &quot;The Dollanger Series is over,&quot; Cathy says at the end.  It's very bittersweet and made me cry.  Not surprisingly, this book involves death.  Finally, Cathy gets closure and peace towards the end of her life.  She realizes that it has been worth something.  She comes to the conclusion that her life wasn't valuable because of what she did, but because of who she loved.  The last four books ended with characters seeking vengence.  This book has characters who are able to move on or even forgive the family members that hurt them.  This is so touching because who wants to live their last few moments hating someone?  All good things must come to an end, unfortunatley.  This is the last book of this wonderful series.  Do not pass it up if you have read the other four.	2001-03-31

It pretty much explains her deep hatred of the children.  I often wondered why she hated the children.  I found out why in this book.  Her hatred is not excusable in the least but it is logical.  Olivia had a terrible life and you have to wonder if she would have been the same hateful person she became if it hadn't been for the bad decision she made in marrying Malcom Foxwarth.  I'm not sure if Andrews wanted us to believe that her treatment of the children was natural and that anyone in her shoes would do the same.  Not everyone who is a victim becomes a victimizer.  In fact, most don't.  I did not identify or root for Olivia but I did enjoy her story.  This story spans over about 20 years.  It answers questions I had that I couldn't find reasons for in the other books.  It is not as compelling as the stories told from Cathy's point of view, but it is definitley worthwhile.  I would read a thousand of these books if they were all in the same saga.  I have never reread a book but I am seriously considering reading 1-5 all over again.  I enjoyed them immensely!	2001-03-24

Annie takes her half sister Laurel and leaves their home forever.  Laurel and Annie's mother is dead.  The two of them stay with a Jewish family in New York.  This is where Laurel spends the rest of her teenage life.  Annie is a chocalte maker and Laurel is an aspiring.  The sisters love each other but a huge hurdle is in their way.  They find themselves both infatuated with the same man, Joe.  Who will Joe choose?  The book concentrates mainly on the struggle of the two sisters in their quest for the same man.  Through most of this book Laurel is selfish and Joe is hot-tempered and a bit of an idiot.  You will probably find yourself rooting for Annie.  At the end of the story I questioned the true beleviability of it.  I wasn't convinced that the woman that triumphed was the woman that Joe ultimately wanted or if he just wanted a bedmate.  This book was somewhat slow in pacing.  I think Trail of Secrets, by Eileen Goudge is a much better book.	2001-03-08
