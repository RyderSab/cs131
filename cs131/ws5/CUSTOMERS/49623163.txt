This book adds nothing in that area.  Reshevsky's Art of Positional Play is much better.<br /><br />The selection of games and positions to illustrate these ideas is also particularly uninspired.  Pachman's Complete Chess Strategy does a much better job selecting material.<br /><br />The lack of commentarty and analysis borders on the obscene for a book that claims it will help me become a master.  I've given games of speed chess more thorough analysis than this.  Where the analysis seems particularly educational and/or thorough, you can be sure it is merely a recompilation of previously published analysis.  As just a couple (of many) examples, the analysis of Botvinnik-Boleslavsky (p182) comes from Botvinnik's 100 Selected Games, and the analysis of Tarrasch-Lasker (p217) comes from Reti.<br /><br />Worst of all, analysis from earlier sources is uncritically poached without the slightest attempt at verification.  For example, the analysis of MilnerBarry-ZnoskoBorovsky (p182) is taken from Euwe's Judgment & Planning in Chess.  In that book, Euwe ends with \\"if 24....fxe5, White plays 25.Qg6 Bf6 the game is decided by the invasion of the rooks by means of 26. Rfc1 with the idea of 27.Rc7.\\"  Alburt & Palatnik copy this sentence almost verbatim.  What Euwe missed (and Alburt & Palatnik didn't even bother to look for) is that Black has 26....e4 27.Rc7 Qxd4+ as a perfectly good defense and White is down a bishop for nothing.<br /><br />You will learn nothing from this book; save your money.	2005-05-08
US	49623163	R2LBVIV2FAO1SA	1889323136	470236870	The King in Jeopardy: The Best Techniques for Attack and Defense (Comprehensive Chess Course Series)	Books	3	35	44	N	Y	Weak	This book is better than its predecessor in the series, Chess Tactics for the Tournament Player, which I reviewed previously.  However, given the particularly low bar set by Chess Tactics, that still means King in Jeopardy is still a pretty weak book.  Some observations: <br /> <br />* The collection of games and positions was HIGHLY unoriginal.  In fact, in 247 pages, there were only FIVE games which I had not seen previously. <br /> <br />* The book in general consists of a series of vague generalities.  For example, on p99, the authors pose all of the following incredibly interesting questions, \\"When should the attack involve pawns, and when should it be led without them?  Can we determine the proper role of pawns in an attack with kings castled on the same side?  Is there a strategic basis for determining correct attacking methods?\\"  Their reply to all of these questions - and I am quoting IN FULL here - \\"The character of an attack is determined by the nature of the position.\\"  They even italicize this sentence for emphasis; apparently they think this is some brilliant insight.  Duh!  Very helpful, thanks.   <br /> <br />* Comments are still ridiculously scarce for many of the games.  Concrete variations are even more scarce.  Several of the games lack even ONE variation or alternative move. <br /> <br />* Analysis is always superficial, and sometimes incorrect.  For example, in Alekhine-Asztalos (p175), we are told \\"42.Nxf7! 1-0 (42....Qxf7 43.Bd3+ Qg6 44.Qf8!).\\"  Well, that evaluation appears to have been uncritically copied from Alekhine's Best Games book.  But in fact, this analysis is incorrect.  Chess Life (May 1993) showed that the correct move is 42.Nf3! and 42.Nxf7 merits a ? not a !. <br /> <br />* In some cases essential analysis is missing altogether.  One of the most debated moves in chess (17....Rxf2 in Bird-Morphy, p198) is given a !? without comment or analysis. <br /> <br />* Commentary when provided is as vague as the rest of the writing.  Page128 rambles on for three paragraphs about the position after White's 28th move in the game Euwe-Keres.  The three paragraphs contain absolutely nothing of value.  The three questions to take away from the position are: who stands better? (Black) why? (The square e4 is weak, Black can quickly mass all his pieces for an attack, and the White queen is out of play on c4) what should he do about it? (improve the position of his pieces to go on the attack).  The authors attempt to answer only the third question, and don't answer even that one particularly clearly. <br /> <br />Conclusion:  You will not learn very much from this book.	2005-04-16

Outstanding.  I often hear that Alekhine was a great annotator.  Bah, humbug!  As far as I'm concerned Keres is the model of a perfect annotator, at least for a player below expert strength.  The variations provided are plentiful and deep enough to provide food for thought without being overwhelming (unlike say Kasparov's MGP series, which has encyclopedic annotations of some games, which overwhelms the non-master).  Beyond simply citing moves, Keres delves into the intricacies of the positions, explaining plans and strategies.  This book will help anyone's game improve.  Can't wait to finish, and I'm going to buy Vol 2 immediately.	2005-03-29
US	49623163	R1CJ9ETIBCU2U	0765340771	936885917	Dune: The Butlerian Jihad: Book One of the Legends of Dune Trilogy	Books	3	18	23	N	N	Good story, bad writing	This book is somewhat better than the authors' House trilogy. I think having freed themselves of the restraints of the original Dune universe, they were able to give free rein to their imaginations and put out a better product. However, the bad writing that characterized the House trilogy remains. It seems like the authors at some point in their lives took a really bad creative writing class where they were told to use lots of flowery prose with tons of unnecessary adjectives. For example, Norma never runs, she is carried by her legs. And they are never just legs, they are short legs. And it's diminutive Norma (because the reuse the same adjectives over and over and over again ad nauseaum). So \\"Norma ran\\" becomes \\"Norma's short legs carried her diminutive body.\\" Rinse, rather, repeat for 675 pages. Just one more example. On page 593, a ship doesn't enter Jupiter's gravity well. Instead we are treated to the following monument to absurd prose: \\"The gas giant reached out to them, beckoning with a siren song of physics.\\"  <br /> <br />Even though the writing is no better, the story is. They did a relatively good job crafting the plot, and depicting the psychology of the struggle. Iblis Ginjo, Vorian Atreides, Serena Butler and Xavier Harkonnen are depicted realistically - if somewhat one-dimensionally. Other characters, e.g. Agamemnon, are less believable. Could he truly believe that \\"the barbarians didn't understand freedom or free will\\" even as they were revolting against the machines' rule? It is unlikely that he could be that oblivious to reality. (The whole \\"brain in a jar\\" concept is pretty 1930s.)  On the other hand, the parallels between the cymeks and the human rulers of Poritrin (whose motivations do seem more plausible than the cymeks) is quite enlightening. It goes along the lines of the \\"good guys vs. bad guys\\" theme which I explored in my review of House Corrino. In that review I pointed out that the authors took a simplistic view of good vs. evil and didnot consider valuable avenues of exploration in their writing. The fact that they do so here shows considerable growth in their writing. <br /> <br />The authors' complete ignorance of science is blatantly obvious in almost every chapter. The absence of even a hint of the science and mathematics behind the \\"inventions\\" of Tio Holtzman and Norma Cenva, despite \\"discussing\\" them at great length, is quite odd. The authors mention \\"arithmetic\\"; what meaningful science involves only arithmetic? What calculations could their solvers work on after only the most basic training? At one point, one of the solvers sabotages a result by \\"moving a decimal point\\" and claiming nobody would notice. If the authors knew ANYTHING about mathematics, they would understand that moving a decimal point is the mistake MOST LIKELY to be noticed. If I'm expecting an answer of 10, and you give me 5 or 20 I might not notice. But if you give me 1 or 100 I will definitely notice. Duh! The science-related quotes that start many chapters are meaningless as well.  <br /> <br />Despite the derivativeness of the robot Erasmus, they nevertheless managed to make him fascinating in a macabre sort of way. What is unrealistic is that he would be so completely clueless about human behavior.  Think Dr. Mengele meets the Terminator.  If intelligence means the ability to learn, then Erasmus must not be particularly intelligent.  The relationship between machines and humans at large is somehow odd. Things like robots serving as drivers of a horse-drawn carriage for a human are not realistic in light of the master-slave relationship. The resources dedicated to keeping the humans alive for slave labor are inconsistent with Omnius's oft-mentioned desire for efficiency. What do humans provide for the machines that they could not more quickly provide for themselves while consuming fewer resources. Surely a machine of some sort could do any required work faster than slave labor (which has long been known to lead low-quality results).  The final chapters of the revolt and the surprise experienced by Erasmus and Omnius on the other hand could form a fascinating study of \\"AI psychology\\" if such a thing existed.  <br /> <br />There are several gaps in the plot, a fact which I would be remiss in not mentioning. Without providing any spoilers, I can provide one example. The flaw in the defensive measures the humans used at Salusa Secundus and Giedi Prime was glaringly obvious. That the machines did not take advantage of it in their raid on Salusa Secundus AND that no human noticed the flaw either in the original design or when Xavier Harkonnen visited Giedi Prime for the specific purpose of evaluating their defenses simply defies belief.  <br /> <br />One last disappointment in the book is that the authors clumsy attempts at foreshadowing gave me what I believe is conclusive proof of where they are headed in \\"Dune 7.\\" On page 224 it says, \\"By the time humans expanded into those distant star systems, Omnius would already be there. Waiting.\\" And in House Corrino, we were already treated to \\"ancient enemy ... future enemy\\" (when Navigator D'murr Pilru goes off course because of the amal). Other brief comments in House Corrino (regarding the unnamed planet that Tleilaxu Master Ajidica was setting up to take his BG axlotl tank) made me hopeful that they might head off in another direction. But now I have no doubt, the Honored Maitres and others returning from the scattering are fleeing thinking machines. This bothers me, as I am fairly certain that is NOT the path that Frank Herbert would have taken had he been alive to write Dune 7 himself.  <br /> <br />My last thought, which really encompasses everything mentioned above, is that the story is not bad (you really want to keep reading to see what happens next), but the writing is bad, bad, bad.  These guys need a good editor like nobody's business.	2005-01-30

If this book were truly representative of \\"the once-secret Russian method of chess training\\" no Soviet player would ever have become a grandmaster in the entire course of chess history.  This book simply does not live up to the hype.  Keep in mind as you read the following that according to the authors the alleged goal for these books is \\"to provide the knowledge necessary to reach expert strength.\\"  Nobody is going to reach anything remotely near expert strength using this book or its companions. <br /> <br />My complaints are numerous: <br />[1] The material oscillates between being absurdly simple for the alleged target audience to being absurdly unclear.  For example, at one point they explain what a pin is.  Elsewhere, they provide a complicated example from the Fischer-Spassky 1972 match with absolutely zero commentary. <br />[2] The examples are too many and too sparsely commented (many have no comments at all) to be of any use to a student trying to learn from them.  As just one ridiculous example, page 180 contains a 19-move analysis with a single comment (\\"now follows a beautiful variation\\"); well, thanks, that was very useful.  The famous game Lasker-Bauer, Amsterdam 1889, merits comment to only one move as well. <br />[3] Many of the examples are downright useless, consisting of a single move.  We are given no indication of how the position was arrived at or how the magical move (1. Qa7!!) was arrived at or even why it merits two exclamation points. <br /> <br />The bottom line is if you are rated below 1700, you will not learn anything from this book, so try Jeremy Silman's or Yasser Seirawan's books instead.  And if you are rated above 1700, you will not learn anything from this book either, so try Dvoretsky's well-respected series.	2004-12-24

Let me continue by saying that when I got to the end of this third book, I was thinking the story could have been told (and told better) in just one book by discarding the fluffy nonsense and keeping just the meat of the story. <br /> <br />Bad writing.  It's still there, and it hasn't gotten any better.  Just one example of the completely ridiculous phrases is on page 552, \\"hold on to the gossamer strands of her sanity.\\"  On its own, that phrase is already ludicrous; what makes it even more so is the fact that the authors had already overused (and misused) the word \\"gossamer\\" a dozen times. <br /> <br />Unbelievable actions.  Literally millions of innocent civilians are murdered without justification, and without repercussions.  A universe where governments behaved this way would not survive the reign of one emperor, let alone 10,000 years. <br /> <br />Hectic ending.  The last 150 pages are unnecessarily hectic as the authors try to wrap up the many threads initiated by the unbelievable actions previously mentioned.  House Moritani, House Harkonnen, House Atreides and Emperor Corrino are all undertaking major military operations.  Furthermore, Jessica is in labor and the amal project is reaching its culmination.  As if all of this weren't enough, the authors throw in an additional plot line involving the twisted Mentat Peter DeVries.  The motivation for his actions in particular has gone beyond the realm of the unlikely into the neighborhood of mind-boggling-ly (is that a word?) stupid.  Usually, when authors have a character do something uncharacteristic it's because of a need to move the plot forward, but this plot already had too much going on without this.  This unnecessary and absurd thread seriously detracted from the ending. <br /> <br />Inattention to detail.  I have previously mentioned that the authors sometimes appear not to have read the original Dune Chronicles series.  Well, now I wonder if they've read their own work.  On page 49, they write \\"A few years ago, distracted by a document he'd been studying, Leto had accidentally crushed the insect.\\"  But that's not actually what happened in House Harkonnen; what actually happened is that Leto was distracted FROM the document BY a guard and the document fell on the insect. <br /> <br />Freedom.  Why do \\"the good guys\\" keep using the word \\"free\\"?  Leto and Rhombur might be good enlightened leaders, but that doesn't make them any less than complete autocrats or make their peoples any more free than they would be under the Tleilaxu or Harkonnens or Corrinos.  This could have provided a fruitful line of discussion had the authors been trying to paint their characters as unaware of their own failings in this regard, but Herbert & Anderson don't seem to have given this a second thought (despite their excessive use of the word \\"free\\") and never manage to move beyond their nave notion of good versus evil to explore this idea. <br /> <br />Overall, I would rate it slightly higher than the first two books in the series, somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.  Still no masterpiece.	2004-11-02
US	49623163	R1I94GY9X4DZ7X	0553580302	698766211	House Harkonnen (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 2)	Books	3	9	11	N	N	Not so good; Not so bad	When I first picked this up, I was looking forward to it. Dune: House Atreides was not all that great, but let's face it - bad guys are more interesting to read about than good guys, right? Unfortunately, I was disappointed. This book is not awful, but it is slightly worse than the first one. My observations...  <br /> <br />Do your thinking for you. This book continues the mistake of Dune: House Atreides in insisting on digesting absolutely everything for you. One particularly blatant example is explaining the true nature of axlotl tanks. This had been hinted at but never spelled out in the original Dune Chronicles; it's better that way.  <br /> <br />Bad writing. Not only do they continue to do the reader's thinking, but they do so with annoying repetitiveness. For example, on p. 206, they write, \\"There was no shame in it for Kailea, either, especially with her lack of prospects.\\" Then on p. 208, they write, \\"For Kailea there would certainly be no shame in becoming the chosen lover of a Duke.\\" This is just one example; there are dozens. Other Amazon reviewers mention other examples (rugs in Earl Vernius's office, use of \\"muscular\\" three times on one page, Kailea's \\"emerald\\" eyes ...). The elecran chapter was a complete distraction; what point to introducing such an absurd creature (were they trying to copy Herbert Senior's brilliant conception of the sandworms? if so, they failed!) if it matters not to the rest of the book? Chapter transitions are still choppy and distracting.  <br /> <br />Boring Sections. Some of the plot lines are monumentally boring. In particular, Duncan Idaho's 8 years at the Ginaz Swordmaster School (which for some reason I can't quite put my finger on, seems to me to be the chapters the authors would be most proud of) are beyond silly. And when you get the end and witness the Swordmasters' pathetic actions, it truly makes you wish you had skipped all the chapters related to this particular plot line.  <br /> <br />Clumsy Politics. The political universe which Frank Herbert created, which we believed had survived for 100 centuries, is shattered by the ridiculously clumsy actions that Herbert Junior & Anderson put their characters through. A universe in which people behaved this way wouldn't last 1 century before cataclysmic war took place.  <br /> <br />Contradictions. The book contradicts the original Dune novel in too many places to mention exhaustively (Lady Jessica's mother is a blatant error). They should have gone back and re-read the original before writing this.  <br /> <br />Unbelievable Plot. Often the authors rely on lazy and contrived solving of plot lines (some our outright deus ex machina arrangements) just to make everything fit together. The motivations of some characters are even more absurd than Lady Helena's in the first book. Some actions are absurd and do not fit in with anything else we've ever read about the Dune universe (the Bene Gesserit when they are visited by the Baron Harkonnen).  <br /> <br />Unlikeable Characters. Even after all of the above, the book would still be above average. Their worst sin, however, is that they simply write many of their characters in such a way that they are downright unlikeable. Abulurd Harkonnen needs to grow a pair. With Rhombur, they seem to be going for the tragic hero, but instead end up depicting an ineffectual buffoon. Most unlikeable of all, Kailea is annoying and petulant (although I think this plot line could have been infinitely improved if the readers -- like the characters -- did not find out what was happening until the end, rather than being told at the beginning).  <br /> <br />For all this, if you are a Dune fan, this book is still a somewhat enjoyable read. Herbert Junior & Anderson had the right plot ideas at the \\"macro\\" level (again I assume this is the result of Herbert Senior's notes and not their own brilliance) even if they failed to execute them properly at the \\"micro\\" level. Again, I would rate this between 2 or 3 stars, although a bit lower than Dune: House Atreides.	2004-10-24
US	49623163	R283UE5BHAGMMC	0553580272	737842842	House Atreides (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 1)	Books	3	10	13	N	N	Not so good; Not so bad	I've been thinking for a couple of days of putting my thoughts up here, except I'm not sure what I actually think of it.  Of course, it's no Dune (which was very much a book of ideas).  It couldn't be.  Heck, the five Dune sequels written by Frank Herbert were no Dune.  I wasn't expecting it to be.  Based on those lower expectations, the book had some merit.  Specifically,  <br /> <br />Pros: <br />* The basic stories are interesting.  Herbert & Anderson have done a good job of developing the original idea (presumably this is due to the fact that they are working from Herbert Senior's notes) <br />* The authors have done a good job of fleshing out the basic ideas into a fairly fast-paced and well-motivated plot.  I was definitely interested enough to keep reading (despite the bad writing) to find out what happened next.  I will be reading House Harkonnen, the next book in this series, as well. <br />* It's an easy read. <br /> <br />Cons: <br />* They spell everything out.  The original Dune was well-known for its nuances and subtle writing.  This book spells everything out for you; the political machinations in particular are beat to the death as the writers provide us with every single detail of who every single character arrives at a conclusion as to who's doing what and why. <br />* The writing level is just not on a par with the original series.  Herbert Junior is clearly not as smart as his father (who is?) and because of this writes as if the reader is also dumb.  I may not be as smart as Frank Herbert, but I'm definitely smarter than the authors.  This sometimes makes the reading monotonous when they review something for the reader for the third or fourth time.  Some things (including most of what they spell out) are better left for the reader to work out on his own. <br />* The character development is often not interesting or deep; some of the characters (e.g., Duke Leto's mother) are downright one-dimensional.  It's often a mystery why they do what they do (can't elaborate without a plot spoiler, but trust me some plot twists are downright unbelievable). <br />* They use the same short chapter technique as the original, but each section is just too short.  As a result, the action often feels jerky, rather than the smooth transitions the original managed to achieve. <br />* There are several disagreements with the original Dune series.  So many in fact that they had to put out a spin sheet on their website to explain away these discrepancies and errors. <br />* It's an easy read. <br /> <br />So, where does that leave us?  Still not sure, maybe 3 stars out of 5?  The only thing I can say with certainty is that it's neither as good as nor as bad as some of the other reviews here would lead you to believe. <br />	2004-10-10

The book ends with two fully (and very well) annotated games from championship events. <br />  <br /> The only minuses are a slightly exaggerated and unwarranted tendency to criticize western chess, and the ocassionally absurd idea which he allows to creep into his writing.

Many of the lines he criticises harshly are now considered the &quot;book.&quot;  It almost seems that the more rudely he treats a line, the more respect that line currently receives.<br />But the most appalling thing of all is that a good number of games have been doctored or made up out of whole cloth.

The line he cites as the game actually come from an analysis of the game.<BR>(2) On page 79, he changes the ending of the game.  The game proceeded 36....QN5 not 36....BR5!<BR>(3) On page 84, he claims Mieses resigned.  In fact the game went on an additional 15 moves.<BR>(4) On page 107, he changes the move order to highlight some analysis.<BR>(5) On page 109, he claims he played 27.QK3!  In fact, he played a weaker move and the game dragged on 21 more moves.<BR>(6) On page 240, he cites a game Alekhine-Tenner 1907 which never took place.<BR>Volume 2 --<BR>(7) On page 250, he changes the ending of the game.

The selection of games is excellent; Kasparov's idea for the book of paralleling the history of the championship with the ongoing development of the game itself is a good one. This is a highly entertaining as well as educational chess book.      It is important to note that the errors in analysis are NOWHERE near as numerous or egregious as other reviews would lead you to believe. I have studied the annotations in detail, many of them with my computer, and found only a small number of (for the most part inconsequential) oversights. (Anybody who thinks they have found 20 errors in one game has made at least 19 blunders.) The only minus is the psychobabble of placing each champion &quot;in the context of his times.&quot;      One area that does concern me is the appearance of parenthetical comments marked GK in several places (e.g., page 305) which are not quotes of other analysts. Did Kasparov use unattributed analysis?	2004-06-28

For me, it will also be the last.  The quality of this book is a lot lower than in the earlier series.  I have been a Turtledove fan for a long time, but based on this effort, I will not continue this particular series.<br />Turtledove had a great opportunity to paint a picture of the Nazi-like Featherston's rise and (presumably temporary) fall.  He could also discuss what's happening in the UK, Russia and France.  (Is Russia even Communist in this alternate world?)  He completely passes on this opportunity, to instead give us hundreds of pages filled with silly and boring prose about characters who have outlived their usefulness by a long shot and should not have appeared in this book at all:<BR>* Nellie and Edna with their ridiculous bickering<BR>* Galtier talking to his horse and engaging in \\"witty\\" banter with his family<BR>* Jonathan Moss with his silly relationship with the Canadian woman<BR>* Martin arguing politics with his family<BR>* Sam Carsten with his sunburn	2004-03-08

Despite the breathless acclamation of this book by executives of all sorts, the truth is this book contains nothing of value. The premise of the book (the absurdly simple fact that \\"not all change is bad\\") has somehow been turned by American corporations into an article of faith (the absurdly false \\"all change is good\\"). <br />If your company makes you read this book, it's probably a sign of bad things to come.

The author covers in brilliant detail how the Cuba of today came to be.  In this book, the reader will learn how Castro transformed the free and prosperous Cuba of 1958 into the poverty-stricken dictatorship of today.  Overnight, this book has been transformed from a historical text to a guidebook for future US relations with Cuba.	2002-05-16

But once you've delved a few pages into it, you immediately recognize that the author has simply mastered the art of brevity - while remainining eminently readable.  The book covers all the material needed for an undergraduate analysis course - and covers it extremely well.  The proofs are easy to follow and extremely instructive, so that the book can also be used in a &quot;Bridge to Advanced Mathematics&quot; or &quot;How to do Proofs&quot; that some schools offer to their math majors to ease the transition from problem-based lower-division courses to proof-based upper-division courses.	2002-05-16

I think it's all right for an author to engage in hand-waving arguments if this enhances physical intuition or even to make the occasional statements without proof if this allows more ground to be covered.  However, if a proof actually is presented, I expect this proof to be correct.  In this book, proofs are sometimes only for special cases of theorems stated more generally and often contain logical errors.	2002-05-11

Wave Equations	Books	5	34	34	N	N	Outstanding presentation - My highest recommendation	This book is THE book to use for any graduate quantum mechanics course. Most graduate programs in the country make the mistake of rushing their graduate QM courses into quantum field theory. This decision is made possible only by sacrificing the advanced non-relativistic QM (say, at the level of Schiff) and introductory relativistic QM (at the level of this book) that is necessary in order to really understand QFT.       This book fights that trend by covering in detail the topics that are thrown by the wayside in the traditional coverage, spending (investing?) page after page on topics that barely merit an exercise or a footnote in more traditional treatements. As just one example, Dirac's equation is solved for the square potential well and for the hydrogenic atom in full detail, without resorting to the usual &quot;standard methods can be used to show that...&quot;      This book is not a replacement to Bjorken & Drell or Itzykson & Zuber; what it does (and does well) is to cover the material that those books don't cover properly (or at all) because their mission is a different one. It belongs on the bookshelf of every physicist or physics student who was denied the opportunity to really master this material before jumping into quantum field theory. They can self-teach it using this book; I did.      The only serious issues with the book are the very large number of typos (but the reader who is following the discussion will have no problem spotting these) and the poor binding from which pages fall out after heavy use (and you will be giving the book a lot of use).	2001-06-22

John's book focuses on advanced solutions techniques for the various types of equations, and is suitable for math majors as well as for advanced undergraduates or graduate students in physics or engineering.  Rauch's book is much more theoretical and requires more mathematical maturity than John.  It is probably of interest only to graduate mathematics students, who would probably find the presentation very interesting regardless of their specialization area.	2001-05-04
