A haunting tale of love and loss ... <br /> <br />In times of loss, we draw upon reserves of strength we didn't know we had, and we all learn that the hard way. This author is no exception, but what sets her apart is her ability and her willingness to share her grief ... in order to, perhaps, help others understand what those who are \\"left behind\\" go through. <br /> <br />This talented author does an awesome job of describing the pain of losing a loved one, the torment she went through, the alienation she felt, and all that accompanies such tragic times.  and how she eventually overcame. <br /> <br />A comforting book, and although Didion didn't go into any spiritual journey that saw her through the tough times, I will still rely on my Bible and my spirituality to see me through, and will take this book out from time to time as an added source of solace.	2005-10-13

I read this book because Oprah recommended it and she usually has Sixth Sense when it comes to good books!  <br /> <br />I wish I had ordered Martha Stewart's new book instead. <br /> <br />Although Frey is a good writer--even masterful in places--too much of the book was repetitious.  <br /> <br />One thing he does well is flesh out his characters so they become real, enabling his readers to sympathize with them. I felt the pain of his characters, but the joy of reading about the \\"overcomers\\" was the highlight of the book. And his dialogue seems realistic. <br /> <br />While I think this book might benefit some people with addictive personalities--in danger of becoming addicted to alcohol and/or drugs--I could only give it a 4-star. It's not for everyone. <br />	2005-10-13

It's not only helpful in handling school-yard bullies, it also trains the children to have the confidence to handle bullies in the workforce and other situations throughout their lives. <br /> <br />This author is to be highly commended for the help she's  giving children, enabling them to have better, happier, more productive lives.	2005-10-08

What a shock to find that she was a teen-age alcoholic. <br /> <br />But who could blame her? ... Being an abused child, it must have been terribly hard to live up to the Hollywood \\"good girl\\" image while trying to fight the demons from her past. <br /> <br />And then to fall in love with an equally popular and talented singer/actorr, Bobby Darin,  who had problems of his own ...  Well, speaking of star-crossed lovers, they were it.  But they truly loved each other, despite the fact they could not work their own lives out. <br /> <br />This book is their only son, Dodd's lovely tribute to them, but it's Maxine Paetro's \\"book.\\"  After reading the book she co-authored with James Patterson, FOURTH OF JULY, I had to go back and re-read DREAM LOVERS again. <br /> <br />I'm glad I did; I see Maxine's guidance, keen plotting, and editing skills throughout this book.  She's a fine writer. <br /> <br />And Dodd is a fine son of parents the world loved.  I hope in writing this book that he got some peace and can now put the past to rest. <br /> <br />Thanks to Dodd Darin, and to Maxine Paetro for enlightening the world about this \\"glamorized\\" couple.

I live in Silicon Valley and love everything about this place.  The story of the two STEVES is local legend and The Woz and Jobs are our heroic icons, people  our kids aspire to emulate. <br /> <br />I became an APPLE FREAK in 1984 when I purchased my first Macintosh to lay-out my Silicon Valley Union newspaper.  That little machine (with the 10-inch screen) saved me $1500 monthly in lay-out fees (with the help of PageMaker) ... and that ain't \\"chicken feed.\\"  Thanks, Apple! <br /> <br />That's a long time ago and since then I've gone through the Liisa, the Classic, the Quadra, and am currently using an iMac.  I've written eight books with the help of Mac, two in print, one due out in November, 2005.  Thanks, Steves! <br /> <br />But as great as I think the computers are, the men behind them are even greater.  I don't know Jobs, but I've met The Woz on several occasions and he is not only the brains behind Apple, he's a \\"genuinely good, caring man.\\"  Ask anyone in the Valley about him.  As one little example, he unselfishly allowed me to use him as a character in my kids book, THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY, and it's a riot to read about him romping around with cartoon characters and real kids trying to save the world from the \\"bad\\" Toonies.  That's just one example of his generosity; he has contributed to many charitable and educational institutions in Silicon Valley and beyond.  Thanks, Woz! <br /> <br />One other thing I admire about Steve Wozniak is that he has always loved to tell jokes (and, YES, to pull practical jokes on people too).  I've been trying to locate a joke book he wrote years ago.  Go, Woz!   <br /> <br />To learn about this remarkable man, from age 11 when he built his first computer, read this book.  It's an interesting, informative reading pleasure.	2005-10-04

Before I read this book, I read this talented author's second \\"environmental\\" book. What I enjoyed about FLUSH is that he takes a serious subject (environment) and teaches children about it with such wonderful, likable characters they don't even know they're learning. AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT HOOT TOO. No preaching! How clever of this author.    The characters were likable ... all except the bully; the plot moved at an exciting pace; the dialogue was sassy; and the setting (Florida) was perfect for this book.    I'm not a died-in-the-wool environmentalist; I believe in development and believe both have their places in this world. Both are needed.  Unlike the developers in this book, most developers are very decent, caring people who believe in saving the environment too.  Most work in harmony with the environmentalists.     Mr. Hiaasen brought the issues of development vs. environment to light in a witty story that is educational too.	2005-09-25

I purchased this book for two reasons: I liked the author's name.  It took me back to my childhood with my sisters in Ohio: Dottie Sue, Billie Mae, and Gladdie Jo.

The second reason is because the book is set in my parents' birthplace, Kentucky. <br /> <br />Silly reasons to buy a book, but am I ever glad I did! <br /> <br />This was my first introduction to this well-known author and I find her style to be endearing in every aspect. Her characters are well-drawn, sympathetic and real. <br /> <br />The plot is an old one: company man on the lower echelon of the pecking order, goes up against his BIG BAD company to protect the workers, and to add to the enjoyment, he finds true love along the way.

THE BLACK SILENT is the most original, gripping story I've read in a long time.  Reading it is like running a marathon race when everything's at stake--including all life on Planet Earth--and all the batons aren't in place when they're desperately needed!<br /><br />I just finished it and I'm stunned at the quality of this author's literary skill, not to mention his obvious intelligence.<br /><br />Action!  Action!  And more action--with our main characters, Sam Wintripp and Haley Walthers, caught in the middle of greedy people and pure evil ones.  With more than one faction out to get Haley's adoptive father Ben Anderson's scientific secrets--and murder being no obstacle--our protagonists are running for their lives as they try to find Ben and save his life's work from getting into the wrong hands. Ben is also Sam's Uncle and Haley's mentor.<br /><br />Without giving much of the plot away, I can tell you that Sam and Haley are super-heroes in the best sense of the word.  At first I thought they were too good to be true, doubting that anyone could spring back from multi life-and-death situations with such agility.  I worried about Haley being more vulnerable than Sam, but with Sam's serious wounds suffered in a previous covert operation that went bad, at times he became the vulnerable one.  They turned out to be a perfect team; always there for each other with near-perfect timing.<br /><br />The average person would be dead after just one round with the horrible antagonists in this book; that's what threw me off at first. But when I got to know Sam and Haley better and began to understand their backgrounds--which were very well integrated into the plot--I realized David Dun knows his characters, and there was no second-guessing him.<br /><br />Sam and Haley are not only Herculean and resilient, they're honorable too.  They're not only out to save themselves, Ben and his earth-shattering secrets, they're out to save the world from one of the most destructive disasters that any author ever dreamed up.<br /><br />Sam and Haley are for real!  And, having known each other for years and had a previous relationship, are they beginning to fall for each other all over again?<br /><br />And if you're into book villains, as most people are, Dun's villain is THE villain of ALL villains. He's one of the most unfeeling, deadly, diabolical bad guys I've ever witnessed in the pages of a book. AND WHAT A PERFECT NAME FOR A VILLAIN! FRICK!!!  Dun portrays Frick and his motives with such perfection, I found myself cringing at what that evil man would come up with next.  He's evil personified!  A guy you love to hate!<br /><br />At least \\"Hannibal the Cannibal\\" had a sense of humor!  Frick has none!<br /><br />This book has more twists and turns than a downhill skier racing down Mt. Everest, and Dun's timing is masterful.  I generally gasp at a surprise ending of a good book, but I found myself gasping all the way through this one.  It was THAT good!  THAT surprising!<br /><br />Although we don't really know what happened to Glaucus, the octopus from the black, silent part of the ocean, who played such an important role in the book, I keep hoping the very talented Dun left it open on purpose--with a sequel in mind.  I, for one, would like to see Sam and Haley bring Glaucus back for another colossal adventure.<br /><br />This book would make a blockbuster movie! The first person I thought of to play Sam was Bruce Willis, my favorite actor, but Sam resembles Brad Pitt, my second favorite actor, and is younger than Willis, so that might not work.  Perhaps there's a new, young actor out there who's a cross between Willis and Pitt!  But who for Haley's part? Jennifer Aniston?  Hmmmmm ...<br /><br />My only regret is that I didn't discover this nationally-acclaimed, best-selling author sooner, but I plan to make up for that oversight by reading all his previous books.<br /><br />Move over Michael Crichton!

If the title doesn't capture you, nothing will! I can just picture whales walking around town on stilts. Hilarious!  At least the title planted the image of HILARIOUS, but then as I  began reading, it got really spooky ... and what a combination that is!! I love a frightening concept in a book ... and when it's interspersed with humor, that's true artistry.    Author Anderson's witty writing style made me laugh all through the book. Excellent entertainment by a super talent!    There was only one thing that threw me off: Though the book has futuristic themes (restaurants in the sky and flying \\"individual\\" transportation), the drawings are all old-fashioned.  Lovely, inspired art, to be sure, but they did not appear to match the text and the era.  It reminded me of a comic book from the thirties, or earlier.  Am I wrong?	2005-08-28

This awesome author is certainly a master of his craft and doesn't need any help keeping me on edge, but the edge seemed to have a bit of a cushion this time. Could the \\"plush\\" difference be the influence of his new co-author, the very talented Maxine Paetro?     And did I detect a bit more humor in this book? You bet I did! Paetro again?     It must have been a perfect collaboration between these fabulous \\"wordsmiths\\" because the differences from the first three books in this series are so subtle as to be almost undetectable.     What an amazing coupling of talents. I hope to hear more from Ms. Paetro in the future. Perhaps another fantastic book with Mr. Patterson ... or a novel of her own?

I find the vast variety of subject matter fascinating, and hope I do well by these authors in daring to review their phenomenal works. <br /> <br />Since my first young adult novel has just been published, I'm even more enthralled to see what other authors have come up with to entertain our kids in wholesome ways. I usually use my two great-grandkids--a boy and a girl--as barometers.  If they like it, then it must be good.  Right? But I don't stop with their opinions; I watch their expressions and level of enthrallment as they read, and discuss it with them afterwards.  Only then do I come to my own \\"kid at heart\\" opinion. <br /> <br />I can honestly recommend this awesome book for boys and girls alike because my great-grands loved it equally.  Their emotions showed on their faces as they read, but their later words spoke volumes when they told me how much they enjoyed this exciting adventure in a very unique fantasy world. <br /> <br />This book definitely gets five stars.  It hooks the reader from the very first sentence, it's fast paced and has enchanting characters that the reader will really care about.  The more I got to know Alexa, the heroine, the better I liked her.  Very well developed characters with realistic dialogue.  Intriguing from start to finish. <br /> <br />Congratulations on a wonderful job, Mr. Carman.  We look forward to the second book in this magnificent trilogy.

He has a way with words that makes every sentence seem like poetry.  Street poetry, to be sure, but he certainly knows the human psyche and the \\"mean\\" streets that spawned his characters.  His dialogue and character descriptions are so vivid, I felt like I knew each of his characters personally.<br /><br />My heart wept for the father, Dean, who suffered through years of degradation and contempt from his mentally-deranged wife. His suffering increased when his diabetic son, little Michael, was taken away, and ... well, I don't want to give any of Thompson's exciting plot away, so suffice it to say that this distraught father was led on a mad, murderous rampage through the mean streets of Los Angeles and surrounding areas.<br /><br />Dean was aided in his daring dash to save Michael by the most likable, humorous police partners that anyone ever penned ... or was he aiding them?  And in the middle of all the excitement and bloody distractions, could there be romance developing between the partners--a seasoned, humorous lieutenant and a sharp, sassy, quick-witted criminal psychologist?<br /><br />Not only does Thompson have a strong, clear voice, his suspenseful plot is unique and well-paced.  His similes and metaphors are the kind every author strives for--fully appropriate to the storyline.  No clich&eacute;s in this story!  Thompson's style brings to mind my very favorite, all-time author, Pat Conroy.  But while Conroy's style is the poetry of angels, Thompson's is a bit darker; poetry of the streets, of the \\"off-beat characters\\" who lurk in the shadows of the city parks and roadways that permeate his characters' world.<br /><br />An intelligent, completely logical writer, it's clear that this author knows police procedures and understands the \\"psychotic\\" mind, as evidenced by the factual, gripping details in describing the progress of the \\"sick\\" woman's decay.  When Thompson finally exposes the idea behind the \\"Springfield\\" of her dream-world, you'll realize it's something we all think about ... at one time or another.<br /><br />It's rare to find such an all-encompassing talent like Chaz Thompson; he embraces all skills of the writing craft--and makes it look easy!<br /><br />I can't praise \\"No One's Ever Sick in Springfield\\" enough!  It's a gripping, suspenseful story that grabs you by the \\"heart\\" and won't let go until the last page.  Actually, I found myself holding my breath during the final two chapters.  It was THAT good--I kid you not!nd the \\"Springfield\\" of her dream-world, you'll realize it's something we all think about ... at one time or another.<br /><br />It's rare to find such an all-encompassing talent like Chaz Thompson; he embraces all skills of the writing craft--and makes it look easy!<br /><br />I can't praise \\"No One's Ever Sick in Springfield\\" enough!

Terry titillates our imagination with her offering of medieval love stories about princes and princesses, complete with fire-breathing dragons and exciting adventures.    Megan Blue Terry wrote three stories for this book.  My favorite is \\"Pay Your Marriage Dues,\\" a touching love story of a husband and wife struggling to accept each other's reality.     And if you enjoy a quick, stimulating read, Betty Dravis (that's me) is the writer for you.  I can't write much about my own works, of course, so please read my short, satirical stories of dark humor and dark horror, then judge for yourself. I hope they amuse and entertain you, as they're meant to do.     Joe DeChristopher pens a story of love found, love lost, a true story that's a glowing tribute to his late wife ... a story that was very painful for him to write.  He also writes a moving tale of a Vietnam veteran who can't let go of \\"ghosts from the past.\\"      Lori Martin paints a dark tale of death and gloom in the unusual setting of a dining room; a must read for horror fans.     Dan Chatterton takes the reader on a nostalgic trip back to the sixties; boys, girls, parents ... and \\"muscle\\" cars, of course.     Daniel Morrison pens a somber story of an overweight boy who has an obsession for a lovely girl in a poster; an intriguing mystery.      And the \\"diamond in this collection of precious gems\\" is a love story by Rosanna Filippello. In \\"Blind Love\\" she writes of a beautiful broadcast journalist who catches her boyfriend in bed with her best friend; an old storyline that becomes fresh under Filippello's masterful pen. Her twists and turns are so exciting you can't quit reading. A remarkable reading experience, as are all the gems between the covers of this book. So find a comfortable chair, and sit back and enjoy the read.\\"	2005-05-20

Since my first novel was an adult mystery adventure/thriller, and my second book is a young adult novel, I relate to writers who can juggle back and forth with ease. THE ANGEL EXPERIMENT is a very imaginative book, and I flew high with the characters, even though I don't have wings.

I wanted his dreams to come true so badly that I almost shouted \\"NO\\" out loud when he fell under Bertha's spell. She was never good enough for him. He finally wakes up, and love soon turns to hate and madness.  But due to Karl's love for their son, he's trapped in a loveless marriage. <br />Bertha is not a nice person, to say the least, and what she and her friend plan for Karl is unforgivable.  <br />I enjoyed the lively discussions held by Karl, his parents and Uncle around the dining room table. He was definitely not a \\"Yes Man,\\" having original, interesting thoughts of his own to share. <br />Though a bit moody to begin with, Karl was quite a remarkable young man ... until he met Bertha. <br />First came LOVE, then came MADNESS, but who was the real nut-case, Bertha or Karl? <br />To find the answer, you must read this book; it's a great lesson in human nature, and a warning of how gossip can ruin a person's life. <br />This author tapped his magic keyboard to write another winner.

Since this is the first book I've read in Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, I seem to have the advantage over the other reviewers.  With no other books competing in my mind against TEN BIG ONES, I can't say whether this is better or worse than the others.    All I know is that I enjoyed it very much, and Stephanie is my kind of woman: dazzling, daring, and delightfully humorous.  If a bit accident-prone, that's okay.  That adds to the realism and makes her more endearing.  Who among us doesn't love a \\"klutz.\\"    And then there's her family: too weird for words, but fun and exciting to be around.  You never know what they're going to do next, especially Grandma.    I can see where Stephanie gets her penchant for getting into trouble and being in the wrong place at the wrong time: definitely from her family.   I like the men in her life and find them both sexy and intriguing.  However, Ranger gets my nod in this book; I would choose him for our heroine.  I realize that's not fair to the ever-faithful Morelli, but then I haven't followed him through nine other books, so don't feel the need for loyalty to him.  It will be interesting to see which one wins her heart when the series ends.    Meanwhile, to entertain us in delightful fashion, Stephanie is sure to get in a lot more trouble and blow up a few more things.  That leaves little time for romance,  but I hope there's enough time!

Janet Sue Terry really knows how to bring her characters alive, especially her main characters,  Nora and Blake. I felt I wasn't simply reading a book, I was dwelling in it ... living side-by-side with these magnificent characters.<br /><br />The heroine, Nora, is my kind of woman: lovely, strong and independent, while at the same time being vulnerable.  There were times I wanted to reach out and hug her, to encourage her ... while at other times I wanted to \\"slap\\" her and tell her to keep her mouth shut, to quit being \\"mean\\" and so \\"unfeeling\\" with Blake.  That was early in their relationship, and before I learned that Nora had some underlying issues to settle before she could enter into a relationship with any man.<br /><br />The hero, Blake, is my kind of man: handsome, strong, passionate, yet caring and kind, especially in the beginning of the relationship.  I could readily have embraced him as the man of MY dreams.  But later on, I often wanted to \\"throttle\\" him for his insensitivity to Nora's pain, especially when an ex-girlfriend entered the picture.<br /><br />And Blake's snobby, domineering mother certainly didn't help the situation.<br /><br />The orphans from Nora's past have grown into intriguing young adults.  They're simply delightful, and fun to be around.<br />Nora's co-workers are wonderful, down-to-earth people who come more alive with each stroke of Terry's keyboard.  Each character is different from the others and they make up for the indifference and \\"mean-spiritedness\\" on the part of some of the people surrounding Blake.<br /><br />Another interesting element for me is that this story takes place in my home state of Ohio, and in Kentucky where my ancestors were born.  It was fun \\"stomping around\\" Cincinnati and hearing a bit about London, Kentucky where my mother was born.  I avidly pursued the accounts of Blake's visits to his Navy buddy who lived in Kentucky.<br /><br />This book kept me up well past the hour of midnight, nights on end. I couldn't wait to see what happened to this charming, endearing, yet frustrating couple.<br /><br />Actually, the ending left me wanting more.  It screamed for a sequel, so I'm pleased that Terry has written more about them in Resolutions.

And I can't wait to read a fictitious book by him.  If I'm correctly reading between the lines of this book, there's no limits to where his fertile imagination and passion for life will carry him.  Now, that will be an exciting reading adventure for his many fans ... possibly even leading to a Pulitzer somewhere down the road!<br />In reading Rehak's other reviews, I note that many are comparing him to some of the eighteenth-century writers ... but not in my opinion; I see him as a modern, contemporary voice who has the depth of character, the courage, and the knowledge to delve into the Gothic past as well as an understanding of the more enlightened, yet somehow even more complex, Psyche of our 21st century .<br />One of the duties of a good writer is to make his readers FEEL EMOTION; make them cry ... make them laugh ... and make them \\"wait.\\"  In this rather dark, suspense-filled story of a young girl and her brother (Flora and Bill) who flee the mansion and \\"good life\\" of their dominant father, Rehak has woven a story that touched my emotions deeply.  I couldn't put it down.  The father's inept handling of his children after the mother died started the problems, but Flora was not blameless.  She chose the wrong path ... and ...  well, I don't want to give any details of this story away, so suffice it to say that in this debut novella, Rehak's unique, daring, writing style runs the gamut from greed to lust to love, incest, and murder.<br />But read it for yourself ... if you dare!!<br />And don't let the dark side of Rehak's writing fool you.  Apparently, this young man has seen, heard, and tasted the good and evil of the human experience, but I believe him to be a God-fearing Christian with abundant personal knowledge of the \\"human condition,\\" and that he's learned the most valuable life lesson of all: Good does indeed triumph over evil.<br />I'm intrigued by Rehak's writing style and longing to see it \\"blossom.\\"  I haven't read his second or third books yet, but am thinking of skipping to the fourth, CRIPPLED DREAMS, which I hear is due out very shortly ... just to see if his genius is shining bright and clear yet ... like the \\"lighthouse\\" that his future works promise to be.<br />But you better believe I will go back and read LOVE AND MADNESS and POEMS FROM MY BLEEDING HEART, also.  Rehak also has a talent for titles; his book titles are so catchy they lure the reader into the book without hesitation.<br />Although I've never been a \\"fickle\\" woman and have never been attracted to younger men (other than in a \\"motherly\\" way), if David Rehak's writing goes where I expect it to, I may just have to ask Pat Conroy, Dean Koontz, and James Patterson, my \\"older\\" favorite authors, to move over and make room for Rehak on my crowded bookshelves.
