I saw him read once, and he's totally cute. And that thing about the pirate shop he has that funds charity? Fabulous. <br /> <br />But this book, and the novel he wrote just before this one, make me tired. It seems too ironic. Eggers seems too detached, and like he creates characters and feelings that aren't real....stuff that seems almost like sci-fi without anything supernatural or otherworldly happening. <br /> <br />I just think he comes up with characters that  that seem false...expatriate Americans, weird guys with death wishes, single women who ego problems, one-armed attractive gals. (And don't even get me started on that darn recurring character named Hand. It isn't funny, it isn't cute. STOP.) Then he throws these weirdly unappealing souls into travel-brochure situations and proceeds to mildly mess things up for them.  <br /> <br />An anteater crashes through a roof in one story. It rains incessantly in another tale where a woman is trying to climb Kilamanjaro. The travelogue details aren't even that good...they often seem like very, very unsubtle devices for removing people from their day-to-day environments. <br /> <br />His switching of styles between stories IS masterful...first person here, third person there. But it doesn't change the fact that he seems like he's only concerned with literary fireworks now, not plotting or character development. Sorry, Dave, but this was the last time for me...no more of your books on my list! I'm sticking to McSweeney's from now on!	2005-06-23

Ann in particular is a luminous portrait of a teenager both insecure and brave, lovely and awkward, immature yet on her way to other things. <br /> <br />These people Hager Cohen writes about are far from perfect..Ann has a destructive habit of flinging herself from high spaces, Wally is a pushover, staying in a marriage that's long over, Esker shuts herself off from the world for reasons that don't really seem sensible, but thanks to Hager's gift, I could at least sympathesize. <br /> <br />Nicely drawn scenes, well-edited dialogue, and these three memorable characters...I really recommend this.	2005-03-08

And it is a valiant effort...other reviewers have perhaps not mentioned that the author wrote it while suffering from terminal breast cancer. She died this past summer. It is a major achievement that she got this book out. <br /> <br />I'm interested in cancer and the issues surrounding people who die from it, as my mother did five years ago. But this novel somehow didn't really affect me much. It didn't get at the horror and pain I saw first hand, and instead of understanding what my mother went through better, I felt like maybe this book wasn't really that worthwhile. <br /> <br />It veers between three eras: when the heroine Trisha is in college, when she is a young curator in NYC; and finally, when, in her mid 30s, she's is dying of breast cancer. In attempting to link these eras, Williams creates a rather lightweight, inconsistent heroine. The prose is pretty awkward, and there are many cliches. I just wish it had really touched me, because Williams's own life and death story sure does.	2004-11-08

Simply put, it's a stunner...a tour de force that seems to capture a place and time (1990s Eastern Europe) as well as the sort of young Americans who gathered there. It was the best thing I read last year, and I've recommended it to everyone I know. <br /> <br />It seems ridiculous to me that many of the reviewers demand that the characters all be likeable. These characters are complex, and yes, some of them aren't that likeable. But this is an elegiac, bittersweet look at twenthysomething expats in a town going through a seismic change. The characters are going through big changes, too, and that isn't always when folks are at their student-council president best. But who wants to read about people like that anyway? (And don't get me started on folks who are bothered that this is about the realities of Budapest and dreams of Prague.) <br /> <br />Yep, some of these characters trample the locals and the system. Others, like the F. Scott Fitzgerald-ish John Price, find inspiration and some cause for hope. So these aren't all folks you want to pal around with? Go read a romance novel or something. I'm not clear that I was likeable in my 20s, so demanding that of characters seems a little feeble.  <br /> <br />But why did I love this book? The way Phillips makes it about the city and about the experience, and not merely a character study. I was sitting reading this looking at gorgeous Montana lake, and his evocative passages about cafes and castles made me want to leave Glacier National Park and hop a flight to Budapest. I'm sorry, but I think that's damn fine writing. One and two-star, he's not.	2004-09-20

I was a major fan of Prague, and so I eagerly awaited this. A complex construction of letters and would-be memoirs from both a bizarre Egyptologist and a plodding Aussie detective follow tales of murder, digging for buried pharoah's gold and love run amuck. It's such a surprise...and such a trick to have not one, but two, unreliable narrators, that I couldn't put it down. Unreliable narrators often bug me, but in this case, they are so funny and deluded, I missed them both when I set the book down. <br /> <br />I think it's a four star, not a five like Prague, mainly because Phillips doesn't give as as ripe and realistic a picture of 1920s Egypt and Boston as he did of 1990s Budapest. Phillips lived in BP and he only visited Egypt briefly, so it's understandable. But I think this would've been a slam dunk with a bit more stage-setting. Characters are a hoot, and somehow I feel like this could be made into a very cheeky film.	2004-09-20

And I'm happy to report this book is, at least plot-wise, nothing like it. But that's not a bad thing at all. Instead, Holman harnesses her considerable humor and wordsmithing to create a well-spun, character-driven paen to the joys and troubles of modern small-town life.  <br /> <br />Veering between descriptions of the main character's cheese farm (does not sound interesting, but is!), a presidential campaign, a family blessed (and cursed) by multiples births and a Lolita-like relationship, Mammoth Cheese is a big mouthful of a book. But Holman's ability to use well-honed facts, quirky characters and interesting plotting makes it all come together. I can't wait to see what she does next!	2004-09-17

And since I bought the book, I obviously wanted to read something like this. But ultimately, this book left me flat and I stopped reading it. Sort of a bad bodice ripper with WAAAY too much sex. Not because it's offensive and I'm a prude, but the reason we cared so much about Elizabeth and Darcy was their wit, their chemistry...their longing and sparring. And somehow, reducing them to two energetic sex puppies is just a bit much. Not romantic, just trashy.	2004-05-31

This 500-plus worder starts out strong, with a set up that's irresistable...man meets girl time-traveling, keeps time-traveling back to see her and eventually, when she's old enough, they marry and live a life of love.<br />Much of the first half of the book made it irresistable to put down..the tension of when and how Henry and Clare would eventually meet, the strange back and forth through time, the electricity and sex when they did meet. (And note to prudish reviewers...if you don't like hearing the \\"F\\" word or the \\"C\\" word, keep to Christian novels or something. Puh-leez)<br />It's the second half..when Henry and Clare are married, that gave me pause. It becomes more apparent, as things go on and on, that the author could've benefitted from a better editor. She's so in love with her characters and their romance that she writes overlong...see the interminable scenes surrounding when Henry first meets Clare parents, their wedding day and the birth of their daughter Alba.<br />The second half of the book also has a different, more tragically propelled tone, and somehow it seems out of place with the fanciful, romantic mood of the first half of the book. Some truly horrific things happen (injury, death, miscarriages) in the second half, and instead of seeming tragic and true, they seem tacked on...as if Niffenegger changed her mind about what this book was--sci-fi, romance, tragedy...mid-way through writing it. The bad things are just over-the-top bad, like something out of VC Andrews...and I think they would've been more touching if they were less dramatic and nutso. Also, at the ending, Clare waiting for Henry far in the future and their thinly drawn, time-traveling, precocious daughter just caused me to go \\"Come on!\\"<br />Overall, I liked this book, but think it's basically a great idea with medium execution. And in many ways, not much happens to justify SOOOO many pages.	2004-02-02

Some are simple, others take a bit more time. <br />What I think is best about this book is how it puts new twists on relatively basic food..that potpie has herbed-mashed potatoes on it, the cakes get interesting ingredients. <br />Some of the dishes require Foster's Market basics-pesto, chive oil-that must be prepared in advance of the main recipe, but nicely enough..you get a page numer reference to lead you straight there. (As dumb as that sounds, I find SO many cookbooks don't do that....)<br />The only caveat: read the recipes carefully...some take longer to prepare than you'd think. And don't miss the risotto cakes..delish!	2003-11-18

I couldn't finish this, due mainly to its plodding writing, bizarre plotting and dorky characters. <br />Belle writes every sentence straight on, subject-verb-object, as if she fancies herself some latter-day Hemingway. But instead of this working, it merely makes her book stulfifying and hard to read.<br />The characters are thinly drawn..some reviewer here said eccentric and delightful, but I found them to be caricatures. Belle seems to create them-a blind judge who is the heroine's boss, a she-man realtor-to make fun of them.<br />The heroine, Liv, is particularly annoying. She's shiftless and vain-drops out of college after a week for some trifle, leaves her marriage in a huff for similiarly silly reasons. She's a little brat! Liv says everything in a snotty tone and observes her life from such a distance. She learns nothing from her experiences, and she (and Belle) seem to despise all the other folks around them.<br /> I simply couldn't read another sentence after about page 100. As a public service to other Amazon readers, I'm not reselling it here. I threw my paperback copy in the trash. No one should have to suffer through this pablum.	2003-10-07

Karyn is an appealing person despite her shops-till-she-drops habit. And in many ways her single in the city tale is far more realistic and interesting than a lot of the chic lit out there. Her issues with work (too much of it), boys (inattentive, potentially gay, etc.) and over-spending (and HOW) ring true. <br />However, it does ultimately have flaws in two areas. <br />Firs, while Karyn created a web phenomenon and led an interesting life, she isn't much of a writer. Lots of \\"anywhos\\" and shifting between past and present within the same paragraph. Some stories (the rodent in her bathroom, her dating a guy named Brad) are funny; other seem self-indulgent. To some extent, this is mimics her website, so maybe this is okay. But she seems like a smarter person than this, so I kept wondering if this book would've been better with a ghost writer.<br />Also, while she ingeniously pulled herself out of debt, Karyn doesn't seem to have analyzed what happened very much, or to have learned from it. I was expecting more insight into why she thought she over spent like that, and how her life was different now that she is out of debt. <br />I don't begrudge Karyn asking strangers for money-it's a great idea in its way-but she seems more interested in having her story made into a movie than in figuring out how to move on and live life without charging $600 coats and hundreds of dollars worth of cosmetics. <br />That story would've been more interesting, and I wish she had filled us in! How DO you change from a shopaholic to a frugal gal?	2003-09-15

But the premise for this book appealed to me, and the fact that the author is a transplanted Yank gave me hope.<br /> The main character, a transplanted Pittsburgher, is married but frumpy, and then she transforms herself and her life after running across a vintage style manual called &quot;Elegance.&quot;  The chapter heads, which go from A to Z, detail everything from &quot;accessories&quot; to &quot;jewelry.&quot;<br />It's a cute premise, and some of Tessaro's writing is pithy.<br />However, this book suffers from the same plot, same lack of surprises and same plodding pace as other across the pond women's books like &quot;Bad Heir Day,&quot; &quot;Pride, Prejudice and Jasmine Field,&quot; and countless others.<br />It raises the same question: why can't any one of these authors think of another plot? In a nutshell, this book, and all its clones, has a slightly downtrodden, perhaps overweight or badly dressed heroine.<br /> She starts to dress better/loses weight/gains self-confidence.<br />She dumps a horrible crush/boyfriend/husband.<br />She somehow gets out of her dead-end job/parent's house/work rut and achieves fabulous success working for a glossy women's magazine/the Royal Opera House/a hip PR firm.<br />She always gets some new, handsome boyfriend at the end, and she always ends up fabulously happy.<br />I'm all for fluff, but I'm sick of reading the same story over and over again.

I thought that story-which details what a rough time Daum has making it financially in New York despite being a sought-after freelance writer-was incrediblely searing, wise and interesting. So this novel-which sounded autobiographical, since Daum, like her heroine, left NYC for the Great Plains-was on my must-read list.<br />But unfortunately, Daum the essayist and wry observer of modern life doesn't check in for this novel. Yes, her descriptions of the New York singleton world ring pretty true. But once her heroine gets to Prairie City (for reasons that are not that fleshed out), the problems start.<br />Daum, who has first-hand experience with both NYC and the Midwest, ends up making both of these spots, and their inhabitants, seem hopelessly one-dimensional. She meets up with a guy that seems like a Manson gang washout, then proceeds-for reasons she AGAIN doesn't really explain well enough-to move in with him. The people she meets in Prairie City seem like \\"Cathy\\" cartoon extras-cruncy lesbians, poseurs who moved to the Midwest from NYC and AGAIN..this downhome boyfriend who looks like Brad Pitt....puh-leez!. <br />The story is neither biting enough to be satire or heartfelt enough to be real literature. It ends up being a kind of Bridget Jones wannabe with serious intent. It is rarely funny. <br />By the end of this novel, I finally had to start skimming. Daum has taken an interesting subject and sucked the life out of it. By the last chapter, I cared nothing for the heroine, and I can't say I'll ever buy a Meghan Daum book again. I can only hope the author's life in the Midwest isn't as dull and stereotyped as it sounds in this novel!	2003-07-14

If they have great photos and idea rooms, they often have text that is trifling and badly written, usually with no good advice either. Or, they have good design tips and inspiration, but it's packed into a bad-looking, text-book like tome. <br />This book is neither. It's a rarity-well-written, full of good ideas, and illustrated with lovely photos. From a wall of common keys that somehow look like art to an inspired table of topiaries, these are easy-to-emulate, high-impact designs.<br /> A section of how-to-tips at the back (a rod with which to hang a kimono on the wall, easy shelving projects) also makes this book a keeper. <br />Highly recommended for collecters, as well, since The Art of Display has plenty of ideas for dispaying collectibles without cluttering up a space.	2003-06-18

The combo of funeral-home lore and insights into off-kilter characters proved irresistible to critics and eventually viewers.This seems to be what Strauss is drawing on: the shock of death, inside info on the funeral industry and decidedly on-the-edge female characters all populate these stories. <br />Yet, somehow, where Six Feet Under makes you care about its characters both dead and alive, The Joy of Funerals feels like a parade of circus freaks. While the women who populate these stories sound morbidly fascinating-a recent widow who beds strange men near her husband's grave, a lesbian obsessed with finding her lover's killer-they come across as thinly drawn wackos. In attempting to say  \\"everyone has a dark side\\" and \\"look at how deeply grief affects people,\\" Strauss has come up with something that seems to trivialize both black humor and sadness. <br />Also, though the characters have different stories and different names, in the end, they all come across as having nearly the same voice. This bleeding together of narratives and mood continues in the last  story, a novella that strings all of the tales together. It's heroine, Nina, who obsessively attends funerals in an attempt to be less lonely, ends up connected to all of the other \\"obits\\" in the book. It's an interesting idea, but it ends up not working. The other women's stories have become so indistinct at this point, that I ended up constantly turning back to the earlier chapters.	2003-05-27

Though it is slightly poseur at times, Cooking for Mr. Latte does a nice job of capturing Hesser's world of cooking,eating and dating in New York.

Good book, bad leading man	Okay, no one picks up a \\"Shopaholic\\" book looking for high lit. And Sophie Kinsella is much better at Bridget Jones clones than many other writers (I'm thinking of the truly terrible Jemima J., Bad Heir Day, etc.) This book is enjoyable, like the other two in the series. But I've got a major quibble: the hero, Luke, is really not very appealing, and in some ways, is about the least dreamy Dream Man I can think of. He's never around, he kowtows to his mother, and he and Becky seem to gloss over their problems with a laugh and wink, not any sort of even mildly realistic discussion. It's hard to see why anyone would want to marry him, so I guess this likeable, fluffy book doesn't go down as well as it should. Poor Becky!

The novel reads like a combo of a breezy woman's novel (Bridget Jones and pals) and an interestingly plotted thriller. Is the heroine a former ballet dancer, wanted by the law in the UK for poisoning her friend? Or is she an ordinary Aussie housewife? Will her former best friend and her smarmy, Fleet Street tabloid reporter boyfriend find out and ruin her rebuilt life? The plot was a little silly. Barr also possesses a knack for humor and nice plot twists.  <BR>     Yes, some details are sketchy: the heroine and her hubby move to a new town and a mammoth new house, yet no one mentions if they have new jobs or not; a few characters drop in and out so often you forget who they are.

It attempts to look at both the underbelly and the inner lives of yuppie New Yorkers. The use of the apartment building as a framing device is interesting, but it ultimately points out the book's weakness: a thin plot, and some rather misogynistic, anti-woman writing. Schickler is really interested in the story of  one woman, Evie, and the two roommates who both want her. That the story is ultimately sick and simplistic is dissappointing; but that Schickler makes us wade through some sort of mediocre, almost-unrelated chapters on other apartment dweller is worse.

But about 75 pages in, I began to profoundly care about the Robys and to completely buy the story. It's basically a small-town, mid-life crisis tale, but Russo tells it so masterfully that this doens't feel like the same-old, same-old. That there is a Dickensian villian and a rather tidy ending seems appropriate, since this has been such a saga. It begins and ends on the river, at the Empire Falls, and this recovering English major bought it.	2002-08-21

But these stories seem to have no point, and she makes motherhood, wifehood, hell LIFE, sound terrible and pointless. Read this book if you are on the fence about having kids or getting married, and you probably won't do either. A total downer, especially the stories about the too-expensive-for-life boutique and the tale about a woman's husband who has, let's say, \\"an incident\\" aboard a plane.	2002-08-21

But here, it's done with overinflated, made up words--think A Clockwork Orange but not as effective--and completely inane characters. This is a bad beach read impersonating as literature, and to say otherwise misleads anyone who might buy it. Please skip..I wish I had.	2002-08-21

While I do see the points of what some of these critics are saying-Jeffers is strangely negative for a woman with four kids (two biological and two step) and this book doesn't use a lot of research, just experiental anecdotes-I think it's worth reading. The negatives of parenting, and the facts that people need to have before deciding to become parents-often get glossed over and prettied up. As a thirtysomething married woman with dozens of pregnant friends and lots of family pressure to reproduce, I'm happy to read at least have one book that provides another perspective. I don't hate kids and don't think Jeffers does either. She's written a book trying to expose the hardships of parenthood, so those expecting her to wax poetically about angelic infants and perfect toddlers just didn't get the right book. Bravo for at least opening a dialogue! Whether or not I ever have kiddos, I'll be glad I read a straight-talking book like this.	2002-04-08

Using top-notch research, she portrays the often brutal world of early motherhood.<br />Like other books on this subject, my only complaint is, why raise these issues and provide no solutions?? This book does reader readers slightly adrift. I'm debating not having kids, and this tome did not convince me to do it!	2002-04-08

It's really more of an episodic novel, because in reality, most of these taleswould not be as meaningful if not strung together. Interesting, fate-infused stories about very average happenings...birth, death, illness, family life, weddings...told with subtly and a complete lack of preciousness. I can't wait to read his next work!	2002-03-29

It's worth reading and valid, but I wonder if the author could've picked more of a variety of people. The folks in these pages are sort of hippie throwbacks, and it made me feel like there are no couples out there like my husband and I-young urban dwellers considering the no-kids life! These people all seem to be hot-tubbing, commune-living weirdos, which is not what I think all childfree folks are. Could be broader in scope, I guess.	2002-03-29

And while I have respect for Mount's writing style, this novel basically stinks. The characters are pretty obtuse, and there are too many of them and they run together...sort of like Brideshead Revisited, except these characters aren't interesting or charming. The just have eccentric names. Due to its far-flung locations and bizarre characters,  this novel should be far more exciting than it is. Overall, much like the hero, a reader can't get no satisfaction.	2001-12-06

Like all the books in this visually stunning series, this one has lovely photography.	2001-11-27

And while it didn't blow me away, I've found it keeps coming back to me weeks after I finished. A paen to the vaguaries of memory, it follows its narrator through a romantically charged friendship with her cousin through her strange college days and on to a post WWII romance that results in a child. We're never sure if what she's remembering is correct or colored by her losses...she's an &quot;unreliable narrator,&quot; as we might say in English 101. But unlike some other unreliables, we care about this character and ultimately, about the book.	2001-08-28

Just don't expect the gritty brilliance of &quot;Kitchen Confidential.&quot; This book is a far rosier and less interesting look at the restaurant biz, but it's likeable. I do think Ginsberg spends a lot of time justifying why she's college-educated and waitressing. In my book, it's okay, and it gets a little tiresome that she goes on about it.	2001-08-28

But Jemima J ranks medium high on the list of all these Bridget Jones Clones out there- the way it switches back and fourth between first-person and second-person to be interesting. Same dumb girl get guy and great job ending, but fun nonetheless. <br />Want better BJ Clones? Read Getting Over It by Anna Maxted, or hell, just read Bridget itself. Then maybe we should all move on with it...surely women can find some other subject to read about besides getting a man!	2001-07-16

This book manages to weaves together complex stories, colorful characters and engrossing history into one terrific package. Dickensian in the best sense of the word, the novel tuned me in to an extraordinary new voice in fiction. I'd recommend this book to anyone..it's that great.	2001-06-22

But this saga misses the boat a bit. It never seems logical, or even probable that the father would exile his daughter for being raped. Though this book is set in the 1970s, it feels more like a 1950s morality tale. It takes that \\"things fall apart, the center cannot hold\\" thing too far, making a seemingly ideal family go from Leave it to Beaver perfection to the mean, wacked out folks they become due to one incident...terrible as it may have been. ... I kept reading and reading and was left dissapointed by the end. Like some romance novelist, Oates sews everything neatly up. If the Mulvaneys got that messed up by the earlier rape, they probably won't keep their stuff together either.	2001-05-16

I particularly enjoyed the way the King's characters seemed to be moving forward, but not neccessarily finding all &quot;the answers.&quot; The descriptions of the South of France are dead on and very moving. (I suspect King's Provence is seen with more realism than Peter Mayle's!)<br />Quite unusual and worthwhile.	2000-10-24

Selfish narrator, unrealistic views of death, YUCK	A few of the short stories in this book do stand up as decent reads on  their own (see the &quot;Outline&quot; chapter in which the narrator deals  with her father's cancer like a term paper). <br />But for the most part, the  more I read this book-and I did finish-the more disturbed it made me. The  narrator, Evie, IS self-obsessed and an Electra like other reviewers have  suggested. But more importantly, she's completely unrealistic and kind of a  sicko. I've been there with a parent dying of cancer...so I can relate to  the pain...but Evie goes off the deep end, and uses her father's death as  an excuse not to act like a normal person. His death is about her...not  about him or other members of her family. Her hijinks -Evie flees to a  nunnery, sucks her own breast milk, and eats her father's ashes-read like  second-rate V.C. Andrews crap.  I feel like Schappell kept trying to see  what freaky thing Evie could do next to shock people. And frankly, by the  end, I could've cared less.	2000-09-08

Many people who contributed reviews for this book don't seem to be real  Rushdie fans, or they wouldn't complain about A. its length B. the way  Rushdie goes on and on or C. that this is a light book for him. It's about  rock n roll for christsake-and his sprawling treatment of it typifies the  history of the music. This is-forgive me-a groundbreaking work, riffing not  only on the rock arena, but skillfully delving into the art world of the  80s and Andy Warhol's universe. It's also worth noting that for an  American, this book goes down much easier than other books because it's our  history, not India's, he's using. Highly recommneded for Salmon virgins.	2000-08-21

The author deftly mixes juicy  details-Julia Gardener Tyler was a shopaholic-with intellectual discourse  on how the way these women dressed changed politics, movies and fashion.

I bought this book hoping for a larky read-I'd admired Frankel's sharp writing in Mademoiselle. What a disappointment! From the &quot;pretty&quot; sister's going on about auras and the  narrator, who so  obviously IS Frankel, I hated this book. The characters were stock and so  dull they were hard to keep straight. (The main character hooks up with a  J. Crew model..puh-leeze! ) The plot was insipid and contrived....a cuppa  Maxwell's if you ask me, not a great Sumatran roast. The ending was pat.  I'd definitely pass on this one--warn your friends!	2000-03-15

My mother, like the narrator, recently died of cancer and had a similiar \\"love lost\\" experience in her 20s. I felt like this book was describing parts of my mother, or any woman for that matter, that others usually can't see. When Ann Lord remembered her affair with Harris Arden, I got goosebumps; when she drifts in and out of coherence on her deathbed, it smacked of an experience I\\"ve just gone through. But somehow, this book is uplifting, not depressing. The use of Faulknerian stream-of-consciousness is deft, and there's just enough of it. The shifts in time and place are brilliant. These people who give this book only a couple of stars just don't get it...maybe they need to stick with Maeve Binchy!	1999-11-23

The romantic entanglements and bouts with her employer were funny and real. Not  recommended for 12-steppers, since this novel preaches the exact opposite  of sobriety!	1999-07-07
