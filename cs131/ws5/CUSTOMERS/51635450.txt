From Hannig's days with the Jungvolk (a youth organization in Germany similar to the Boy Scouts - in contrast to the Hitler Youth) in 1940 to his flight training experiences and subsequent posting to the \\"Green Hearts\\" Fighter Wing in Russia, the book is easy to read.  The narrative flows and is not at all boring.  You get a sense of the man himself and the effects of the daily grind of operations over an ever changing front.<br /><br />(John Weal, who translated Mr. Hannig's book, is in his own right an expert on the Luftwaffe fighter arm.  Check out any of his books in the \\"Aircraft of the Aces\\" series, which are published by Osprey Publishing.)<br /><br />For any reader who is keenly interested in reading about the lives of obscure Second World War aces, this book will make a welcome addition to your library.

In the opening pages, the author evokes an image of a sleepy Cornwall in the depths of a harsh and frigid winter.  George Warleggan continues to expand his power and influence over the community.  His wife Elizabeth (once Ross Poldark's great love)  has given birth to a son, Valentine.  Her son from her previous marriage to Ross' cousin Francis, Geoffrey Charles, has been given a governess, Morwenna Chynoweth (a cousin of Elizabeth's) to tutor him.<br /><br />Two of Demelza's brothers, Sam and Drake Carne, both ardent Methodists, come to Ross and Demelza, seeking a new life for themselves in the community.  Ross is not exactly thrilled to have them there.  But he gives Sam a job working in one of his mines and Drake assumes a trademan's life.  With the coming of the Carnes, Methodism in the community is given a considerable boost, which doesn't sit well with a number of the local notables.<br /><br />The novel goes on to describe the ongoing relationship between Caroline and Dr. Dwight Enys, who had gone into the Navy when it seemed impossible that he and Caroline could marry over the objections of Caroline's uncle and guardian, who had deemed Dr. Enys as socially unsuitable for his niece, who soon stood to acquire an inheritance.  The ship on which Dwight is serving as a surgeon is involved in a naval battle near the French coast, and most of the ship's survivors, including Dwight, are taken prisoner.  When Caroline gets wind of this, she begins, with Ross, a campaign for Dwight's freedom.<br /><br />There is also a developing relationship between Morwenna and Drake, which creates further conflict between the Poldarks and the Warleggans.<br /><br />Again, as in the other novels of the Poldark Series, this is a novel that never falters.  Besides the principal characters, there are also a number of minor characters who further enliven and enrich the drama.  This is some of the best historical fiction you'll ever find.<br /><br />So, take a seat by the window of your favorite room or stay in bed one holiday or weekend morning and enjoy what is a richly textured, well-told story.

Or whether he would survive or be maimed or crippled.<br /><br />Unlike their German counterparts (who had the \\"Hennecke\\" harness in the later stages of the war), the Allied airman was issued no parachute.<br /><br />\\"WINGED VICTORY\\" brings back the immediacy of what it was like to be a British fighter pilot on the Western Front in the last year of the First World War.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />P.S.  One minor note:  Cundall flew a Sopwith Camel, not an S.E.5A as featured on the cover.	2004-09-15

An invasion of Britain could only have succeeded through a concerted effort of the German Army, Navy, and Luftwaffe.<br /><br />Furthermore, the German leadership was not wholly confident that Germany could defeat Britain.  For a short time after France had fallen, it had hoped that Britain would be conciliatory to Germany and sue for peace.  But when it became clear that Britain would fight, the Luftwaffe adapted a series of shifting tactics to neutralize and destroy RAF Fighter Command.<br /><br />First, there were the attacks on shipping in the English Channel and radar stations.  Then the Luftwaffe shifted over to attacks on RAF airbases, which, had they been more consistently carried out, might well have \\"neutered\\" RAF Fighter Command.  Instead, Hitler, in a pique of anger over Britain having dropped bombs on Berlin, set the Luftwaffe to bombing London.  This gave RAF Fighter Command the breathing space it needed to rest, refit, and take on the Luftwaffe in larger numbers.  (Bungay shows that throughout the Battle, British aircraft production increased significantly relative to German aircraft production.)<br /><br />Germany, full of hubris in the summer of 1940, made the mistake of underestimating the capacity of the RAF to challenge the Luftwaffe and Britain's will to fight for its survival.<br /><br />The book is well-written, comprehensive, easy to read, and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2004-09-15

Ross and his cousin Francis are trying to keep afloat a mine that they have maintained for some time.  But Ross is hard put to get the necessary additional financing and finds himself falling deeper in debt.  George Warleggan firmly establishes himself in Cornish society and as an economic powerholder in Cornwall.<br /><br />The growing power and influence of Warleggan throughout the novel is highlighted, as are the lives of Ross & Demelza, Francis & Elizabeth Poldark, Dr. Dwight Enys (a close and trusted friend of Ross, whose radical approach to practicing medicine has made him both loved and scorned throughout the district), and Caroline Penwenen.  Ross and Demelza, in particular, experience some struggles that put their marriage to the test.

The world of female werewolves is representative of a part of the horror genre that has been little explored. Aside from 3 or 4 exceptions, the stories were flat. One of the dullest stories by far in this collection was the one with the Jamaican woman werewolf. It read like a series of disjointed vignettes, haphazardly patched together, leaving no sense of what she was really like, either as a woman or as a Wolf.<br />Sadly, there are too few novels out in the market now that provide a well-developed and credible treatment of the female werewolf (the exceptions being the novels \\"BITTEN\\", \\"STOLEN\\",\\"SHADOW OF THE BEAST\\", and \\"NAKED BRUNCH\\").<br />I give this collection 1 star only because I hope that it will inspire other writers to develop more works (short stories and novels) featuring well-rounded, down-to-earth, real women - who just happen to be werewolves.	2004-04-08

In particular, the Messerschmitt 109 fighter, which outclassed it in almost every respect.

From the first pages, the reader is made witness to the growing pains of an air arm which, from the onset of war,  worked mightily to fulfil the roles given to it by the British Army in France.  Whether it was in the areas of reconnaissance, artillery spotting, bombing, and later in the role of achieving aerial supremacy over the battlefield and beyond the lines, the RFC adapted itself well, and in the process, laid the groundwork for the establishment of the world's first independent air force, the Royal Air Force, on April 1, 1918.<br />This is not a dry history.  Mr. Barker also provides through letters and diaries, vivid and poignant accounts from the pilots, observers, and ground crews themselves into what the war was like for them.

A war that could easily have been avoided if Moscow had simply given Chechnya the sovereignty it sought in the early 1990s.  Here in this book, Anne Nivat shows both the horrors and absurdities of the Chechnyan War.<br />Like the other reviewers, I commend Mlle. Nivat for her courage in going out on her own into Chechnya to get at the heart of the story. Anne Nivat is a gutsy woman. Her story is all the more remarkable and sobering given the efforts of Moscow to censure the news reportage from Chechnya.  Being a fluent speaker of Russian also allowed Nivat to form personal bonds with many of the people she met.  Thus, the reader gets a more intimate insight into the daily perils people face in Chechnya.	2003-11-04

(This is the novel, some of whose elements were  later adapted to the screen as the Disney movie &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;.)<br />White has written a delightful, entertaining story not without its harrowing moments.  We first see Arthur as a boy (\\"The Wart\\") living with his adoptive family and serving as a page to his older brother.  Merlin's role at the beginning of the novel is as a teacher for Arthur. (Note. Merlin had been entrusted by Arthur's real father with protecting his son.)  He leads Arthur on a variety of adventures, which I won't go into here, except to say that the reader will be amazed with the rich imagery White creates.<br />The novel progresses through Arthur's life, his reign, his sorrows and joys, and the perils and highpoints of life in an England mired in upheaval and turmoil.

Both authors provide concise biographies of a number of military figures whose individual service is shown as emblematic of the services the Wehrmacht rendered to Hitler between 1939 and 1945.	2003-10-29

SAIL ON	Sit back in your favorite recliner and prepare yourself for an exciting adventure!  Here, in the pages of \\"MASTER AND COMMANDER\\", the reader is introduced to Captain Jack Aubrey of the Royal Navy and Stephen Maturin, physician, linguist, scholar, spy, and then some.<br />The novel begins in Port Mahon in 1800.  Aubrey, for the moment, is a naval officer without a command, restless and impatient for action. (Britain and Revolutionary France are at war.)  Quite by accident, he literally bumps up against Stephen Maturin and a budding friendship develops between them.<br />O'Brian faithfully evokes the atmosphere of those distant times. The language may seem a bit stilted and obscure.  But part of O'Brian's genius as a writer is that as you read deeply into this novel, you'll soon find yourself swept along on the ebb and flow of events.  All your senses will be titillated.<br />Besides Aubrey and Maturin, O'Brian creates here a variety of richly textured characters who bring vividly forth the ambience of wartime shipboard life in the Age of Sail.<br />So, if you're looking for a thoroughly engaging and captivating story, \\"MASTER AND COMMANDER\\" is it!  Highly recommended.<br />(I first read \\"MASTER AND COMMANDER\\" in July 1994.  Ever since, I've been hooked on the Aubrey-Maturin series.)	2003-10-29

The Focke-Wulf 190 was rugged, capable of taking enormous punishment in combat (the chapter describing the service of FW-190s in the Schlachtgruppen bears this out), and excelled at low to medium-level altitudes, which was typical of aerial combat on the Ostfront.<br />This book offers an excellent overview of the operating and handling characteristics of the FW-190.  And it also provides interesting accounts by some of the pilots who flew the FW-190 on the Ostfront.	2003-10-17

I read it for hours nonstop.<br />The story that Speer relates here of his life and career in the Third Reich, first as Hitler's architect, and later as the Minister for Armaments and War Production (1942-1945) is gripping and compelling.  You get a real, tangible sense of what the people (e.g. Goering, Hess, Himmler, Goebbels, Bormann, etc.) were like who played key roles in Nazi Germany.  <br />This memoir does not read like a dry retelling of historical events.   You feel yourself a witness to an unfolding drama of deceit, treachery, genocide, and war in the heart of the Third Reich.  All of these events may seem incredible as Speer describes them.  But they happened, and in reading \\"INSIDE THE THIRD REICH\\", you see how it was that Germany was led down the path to destruction by its political leadership.	2003-10-15

It is really a shame that his works are not more widely published, because his writing is on a par with Patrick O'Brian.  What is more: Fullerton was in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, having served on both surface ships and submarines.  He knows well what he writes.<br />This particular work gives the reader a flavor of the dynamics of the naval war in the Mediterranean and a view of life in wartime Egypt during 1941.  There's also romance and intrigue.  So, if you're looking for a novel that has a richly textured plot, and is also fast-paced, look no further.  \\"LOVE FOR AN ENEMY\\" is it!	2003-10-10

With Shirer, you have someone who was a witness to many of the events described in this book - e.g. the Nazi Party rallies at Nuremberg, Hitler's marching of troops into the Rhineland in 1936, the incorporation of Austria into the German Reich in March 1938, the Munich crisis, and the French surrender in June 1940.<br />Shirer also makes skillful use of the wealth of Nazi archival materials to give the reader a full scope of the characters and policies which defined and shaped Germany between 1933 and 1945.<br />In today's uncertain times, reading this book should also serve to remind the reader that any democratic government, whether threatened by real or perceived enemies, can succumb to Fascism if its people permit the slow or precipitate undoing, by executive or legislative fiat, of their civil liberties.	2003-10-06

A beautiful woman with penetrating eyes.<br />Once I began to read \\"TINISIMA\\", I became utterly captivated with the life of Tina Modotti.  Elena Poniatowska has a way of making the narrative read as if Tina Modotti herself were relating various happenings from her life to the reader, while the author adds her own commentaries as a supplement.<br />The more I read of this novel, the more I found myself curious about this woman and her life.  It got to the point that I could hardly tear myself away from finishing this novel, though it pained me to see how Miss Modotti was manipulated and abused both by some of her friends/compatriots and the Stalinist system she once served so faithfully.  I believe it was a mistaken faith, but I respect Miss Modotti for the courage of her convictions.  She had good intentions, a big heart, but was prone to blind herself to the evils of Stalinism.  Therein lies the ultimate tragedy of her life.<br />Tina Modotti could have gone on to become one of the greatest photographers of the last century had she not threw herself wholly into Marxist/Stalinist politics.  Perhaps it is for that reason that she is not widely known today.<br />I wish I could have known Tina Modotti.  I would have loved to have had lots of conversations with her in some caf&eacute; or small restaurant.  While I'm sure we would not agree on a number of issues,  I like to think we would have become close friends.<br />Thank you, Elena Poniatowska, for a beautiful book.	2003-07-07

She weathers a lot of trying experiences and shows herself to be resilient.<br />The only fault I found with the novel, however, was in the sequencing of historical events. For instance, some of what the author stated about the placing of some events during the First World War were not accurate.  When I read a historical novel, I get a better appreciation for the novel when the historical events it describes are true and placed in the proper sequences.  Perhaps for some other readers, that matters little.  But for me, that took away from me giving this novel 5 stars.	2003-07-07

Now, I confess not to have yet read \\"PAPILLON\\".  So, my critique of \\"BANCO\\" is not reflective of what \\"PAPILLON\\" was about.<br />\\"BANCO\\" takes up from where \\"PAPILLON\\" left off.  The author has escaped into Venezuela.  He is deeply embittered and finds it difficult at first to readjust to life on the outside.  He is set on revenge for he feels that he was framed for a crime he did not commit.  As a way of working out his anger, the author becomes involved in an elaborate plan to stage a big robbery so that he can not only enrich himself, but also return to Europe and exact his revenge.  While set on his plans for revenge, however, the author finds love and peace of mind.<br />\\"BANCO\\" stands as a fine example of what a person is capable of achieving in terms of self-improvement and spiritual renewal. When I finished reading this book, I felt very happy for the author, who had learned to cast aside the anger and rage he had bottled up inside himself during his imprisonment on Devil's Island, and find an inner peace for himself.	2003-07-01

It's a refreshing morality tale and provides an interesting departure from the usual werewolf fare.  Annie Engel, both as a woman and as a werewolf, has a big heart and soul.  She is representative of those of us who are sickened by the rich and powerful, who, time and again, place profit and personal gain over the best interests of humanity. Consequently, we feel frustrated by our relative powerlessness as individuals to do anything to stop the amoral robber barons and 'merchants of death' in today's world.  At least, when Annie becomes a Wolf, she can sniff out these amoral powerbrokers and hunt them down.  She's a righteous Wolf!<br />WHEN WILL THERE BE A SEQUEL???	2003-07-01

That is, until I read this novel, the first of the series for me.<br />In this novel, Winston Graham provides rich character sketches of Clowance and Jeremy, two of the Poldark children. Clowance is a free-spirited, sensitive, yet sober-minded kind of young lady. You see her becoming acquainted with a young man who was fished out of the sea, and are witness to her growing attraction to him. He (Stephen Carrington) is an adventurer, a dreamer, a striver, a charmer, and a gambler. Yet, he has a good heart. A big heart. I don't think it at all strange or odd that a young woman should be attracted to a man who is a bit rough round the edges as Stephen is. The reader may consider Stephen Carrington as a force of nature in terms of his personality and spirit.<br />Jeremy's story is especially touching. He and his father have a somewhat uneasy and distant relationship, which by turns, begins to become closer. And there is also Jeremy's growing love for Cuby Trevanion.<br />Contrary to what the earlier reviewer said, I thought &quot;The Stranger from the Sea&quot; was a wonderful story. In addition to Ross and Demelza, you begin to see in this novel how the lives of their children are shaping themselves. I liked that. And the author's descriptions of Cornwall are so evocative. You can almost feel the salt of the ocean on your skin and clothes as it pounds against the beach, or feel the touch of a rising breeze sweeping across the hills, signaling the approach of an autumn storm.<br />I can hardly wait to read the rest of the series!	2003-06-25

Marshall and other fine soldiers such as Matthew Ridgway, Maxwell Taylor, Bradley, Eisenhower, and Patton, that the U.S. was able to develop, by 1944 and 1945, one of the finest armies in the history of the world.<br />What is also really good about this book is the insight Perret provides about the ordinary GI and the distinguished service provided by Black combat units, such as the 969th Field Artillery Battalion, the 761st Tank Battalion (which served continuously in combat longer than any other U.S. tank battalion in Europe), the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion, and the 92nd Infantry Division.<br />I highly recommend this book.  It offers an excellent introduction to anyone who wants to know more about the U.S. Army and its role in the Second World War.	2003-05-07

We see Nadya, living in a world of fear, loathing and intolerance for what is deemed unseemly and inexplicable, learning to live and thrive, both as a Woman and as a Wolf. In the process, she finds acceptance in a new life she is able to establish for herself out on the frontier.<br />The author provides vivid descriptions of the experiences Nadya faced in making the trek westward in the 1840s. You feel yourself being carried across an arid landscape on a rickety wagon and on through the snowy Rockies (facing all kinds of hazards and overcoming them) with Nadya, Elizabeth, and Jenny.<br />One touching scene in the book is when Nadya as a Wolf (having been spurned earlier in the day by Elizabeth, who has never felt right about her romantic attachment to Nadya) allows herself to be mated with a male Wolf. In that moment, you experience Nadya's joy at that moment of orgasmic release as she howls ecstatically to the skies.<br />For those readers seeking a werewolf novel full of gore and gratuitous violence, you won't find it here. But if you want to read a well-told tale about the life and experiences of a female werewolf in 19th century America, you've come to the right place.	2003-04-24

The world of female werewolves is representative of a part of the horror genre that has been little explored.  Aside from 3 or 4 exceptions, the stories were flat.  One of the dullest stories by far in this collection was the one with the Jamaican woman werewolf.  It read like a series of disjointed vignettes, haphazardly patched together, leaving no sense of what she was really like, either as a woman or as a Wolf.   <br />Sadly, there are too few novels out in the market now that provide a well-developed and credible treatment of the female werewolf (the exceptions being the novels &quot;BITTEN&quot;, &quot;STOLEN&quot;,&quot;SHADOW OF THE BEAST&quot;, and &quot;NAKED BRUNCH&quot;). <br />I give this collection 1 star only because I hope that it will inspire other writers to develop more works (short stories and novels) featuring well-rounded, down-to-earth, real women - who just happen to be werewolves.	2003-04-22

Reeman's ability to get into the head of Tim Rowan, the Fleet Air Arm fighter pilot, was amazing. I felt that he had gotten completely into Rowan's mind and gave the reader a full appreciation of the perils a naval aviator faces on the high seas in wartime. The secondary characters (e.g. Tim's closest friend, the arrogant admiral, and some members of the carrier's crew) stood up well on their own and rounded out the story very nicely.	2003-02-11

Considering his humble origins in an England heavily rooted in class, and his rise from a bugler in the Royal Engineers to a mechanic in the Royal Flying Corps to one of the finest fighter pilots of the First World War, James McCudden shows that anyone can aspire for greatness, provided one is willing to work and sacrifice.<br />For anyone with a curiosity about what air warfare in the First World War was really like, READ THIS BOOK.  I highly recommend it.	2003-02-04
US	51635450	R4WO3FN27WV45	082175288X	784723469	Wolfsong	Books	3	1	1	N	N	PLAYING HAMLET	For those of you not in the know, \\"WOLFSONG\\" is a followup to \\"THE WEREWOLF CHRONICLES\\".  In this story, Phyllis has fully assumed a new identity as Loraine Turner, trying to jumpstart a career as a dancer.  She lives under suspicion by the LA police for the murder of her roommate.  The struggle continues in which Loraine tries to balance her increasingly problematic, chaotic life.  It is an interesting story, though it was hard to accept the way Loraine was finally able to deal with living a dual life as a woman and a Wolf.  Hence, the three (3) stars.	2003-01-28

There's lots of drama here to offer some excitement.  The woman's monthly metamorphosis into a Wolf is, for her, an orgasmic experience, giving her a sense of untrammeled power and freedom -- though when human again, she is deeply troubled about her newly made dual self. An interesting story.	2003-01-28

It is refreshing to have on the market a novel about a female werewolf that is credible.   I say 'credible' because the storyline was easy to follow: Woman goes out of town where she barely survives an attack by a werewolf. Woman returns home to California, her wounds heal quickly, and with the advent of the full moon, changes into a Wolf.  At times, the novel was a bit comical.  In particular, the time when Phyllis awakes on the beach in tattered clothing with not a clue as to how she got there!  Then scampering naked in panicked flight home.   (In another instance, Phyllis as a Wolf, leaping wildly from car to car on the highway, disdainful of what she regards as 'steel monsters' and 'two-leggers'.)   If you like werewolf novels, while this is not a great work, it's worth reading.	2003-01-27

The naked self that many of us see in the morning before we dress for the day, though many of us are at times loathe to embrace and accept it.  Friedler, through this book, shows us people who are brave and honest enough to throw off pretense and bare themselves unabashedly.  Well done! Take heart when reading this book and be proud of your naked self, too.	2003-01-09

I really appreciated what the 30ish woman (a brunette social worker) had to say about her reasons for posing. Kudos to her! Granted this book speaks to the voyeur in each of us. But it also shows how liberating it is to be naked and proud.	2003-01-09

Carter has written an intelligent and intriguing novel that reads very much like something out of real life, with the exception that we are given entree into the life of a woman who is a werewolf.  Usually, werewolf novels tend to be overly male-centric and treat the werewolf as a mindless beast crazed with bloodlust.  So, it was for me, very refreshing to read a novel about a WOMAN WEREWOLF. (The transformation sequences were well done. I could appreciate Jenny's anxiety when she woke up one morning naked not far from the remnants of an animal she had killed the previous night as a wolf. Frightened, she managed to make it home, barely escaping exposure. )<br />I was also fascinated with the way Jenny, through psychoanalysis, was able to tap into her \\"Wolf\\" side, overcome a number of challenges, and learn to fully embrace and accept being a werewolf.<br />Hopefully, in future, more intelligently written and imaginative werewolf novels will come into the market.  Novels that feature men and women alike as werewolves, hailing from all walks of life.  May some deft writer or group of writers do for the werewolf genre what Anne Rice has already done for vampires!	2002-12-10

As the son of a Second World War veteran of the European phase of the war, in reading Mr. Wellum's account, I want to thank him for helping to make real in my mind, the stresses that war places on you. In particular, while reading the chapter in which Mr. Wellum describes his chase of a Junkers 88 bomber in foul weather and his subsequent efforts to return to his airbase, I felt as if I were the cockpit with him, hoping that I'd get down safely and in one piece!<br />Having read other books by and about the famous RAF aces (Bader, Tuck, and Paul Richey), I recommend this book very highly. It's very well-written and will give you a deeper appreciation for the sacrifices made by the Second World War generation. Thank you, Mr. Wellum, for your service and for this book. There are many more people than you may realize who are grateful for what you have written. Thank you again.	2002-11-21
