I tried my best to maintain a stiff upper lip, but found myself watching a re-watching an Astaire-Rodgers dance routine from \\"Top Hat\\" and the \\"dancing in the dark\\" routine with Astaire and Cyd Charisse from \\"the Band Wagon\\" (set perhaps not coincidentally in Central Park). Looking back I guess I was looking for innocence and grace, produced in the depth of the Great Depression (the movie \\"Top Hat\\") or the height of the Cold War (\\"the Band Wagon\\"). In any case I serves as a reminder that NYC is a place of the imagination for billions who have never and will never visit it.  <br /> <br />This came through with many comic book artists, who for decades made NYC the site of countless apocalyptic show-downs between superhero good and arch-villianous evil. So much so that 9/11 seemed like an eeire realization of generations of cartoonists nightmares. Many responded by working in themes related to 9/11 into their story lines. Special issues abounded celebrating the first responders as \\"true heroes.\\" No one can doubt the sincerity of these efforts of so many who lived and worked in NYC and dreamt of \\"Gotham\\" or \\"Metropolis.\\"  <br /> <br />Art Spiegelman responded in another way. Going beyound the Silver or Golden ages of comic books to the pre-comic book \\"platinum age\\" of the original comic strips founded by the warmongering \\"yellow journalists\\" Josef Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst (the Rupert Murdochs or their day) \\"just two blocks away from where the towers stood.\\" Embracing something quintessentially american, yet also incorrigibly subversive, he realizes his loyalty to his adopted home of NYC.  <br /> <br />In 10 \\"strips\\" an introductory essay and a \\"Comic supplement\\" sampling some of the classic strips and an essay explaining their influence on him, Speigelman tries as best he can to sort through his trauma of that day. By turns hysterical, paranoid, narcissistic and self-conscious he brings forth reflections as honest andthey are hard won. At first he obsesses compulsively about government complicity until he hears arabs reflexively spin anti-semitic conspriracies. He labors to find a medium to capture the image burned into his eyes, uncaught by any camera of the \\"bones of the tower\\" glowing immediately before it goes down. He wears an \\"peace symbol\\" upside-down, like a flag signaling distress, suggesting that \\"pure and simple\\" pacifism and anti-militarism are insufficient to meet the current crisis. <br /> <br />Yeah it carries an ant-Bush theme that will delight anyone who liked \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" but it's more than that. This is an intensely personal work for  Speigelman who lived just a few blocks away from the towers, in away that Moore's film can't be. It does not have a straightforward narrative like his masterpiece MAUS. The narrative comes in memoirs or dairy entries in a confessional style reminiscent of some of R. Crumb's <br />recent stuff. But the elements are the images and devices borrowed from those early comic strips. Speigelman as \\"Happy Hooligan\\", Speigelman as a mouse-like \\"Little Nemo\\" falling out of bed, Spiegelman as Jiggs from \\"Bringing Up Father.\\" His mastery of these styles, and their disturbing effect, compares with Chris Ware.   <br /> <br />Speaking crassly, this book is an \\"art book\\" while it's listed as \\"hardcover\\" that is misleading. the Cover as well as the \\"pages\\" are printed on card-stock. The Strips fold out like one of those double albums which allows for unobstructed viewing. Speigelman has not skimped on anything in terms of printing or color or dimensions. The spine has a tendency to crack and the card stock leaves the book susceptable to warping, Bibliophiles take note! But at $19.95 (not to mention generous discounts at Amazon and chain bookstores because of it's \\"bestseller\\" status the book is a steal. <br /> <br />Thanks Art. And congratulations, you just may finally have become an artist \\"in sync\\" with the times instead of \\"seconds ahead of it.\\" <br /> <br />Here's hoping anyway.	2004-10-10

Being raised by Goldwater Republicans, the Kennedy mythos held little sway. But I was 6 years old when RFK was assasinated and I saw him dying lying spread eagle on the floor, his head haloed in a corona of blood, his face impassive. <br /> <br />I still have no sympathy for the Kennedy mythos and I have no sympathy for messianic politics (looking for the leader, whether left or right), but I've been drawn to RFK. He alone was really devout. He alone really saw the moral dimension during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He alone accept his share of  responsibility for Vietnam.  <br /> <br />This book was written soon after RFK's death and it's a wonderful memior. Newfield is not a \\"kennedy groupie\\" altho' he is so, so close to his subject you forgive him for his hero worship. It is not to be treated as an objective historical document, Newfield is blind to the achievements of the Great Society and vicious towards LBJ, but given the context in which he wrote that's hardly surprising.  <br /> <br />For a more critical, yet remarkably complementary (when it comes to RFK) account, I would recommend Garry Wills THE KENNEDY IMPRISIONMENT.	2004-10-07

Thomas Frank is a &quot;progressive,&quot; most probably a democratic socialist. He doesn't &quot;get&quot; the &quot;family values.&quot; He doesn't &quot;get&quot; christianity. He doesn't &quot;get&quot; why a member of the working class would give themselves over to fighting against abortion or gay marriage or evolution, instead of labor organizing. Nonetheless, he throws light the way only an outsider can on why the &quot;religious right&quot; does yoeman service year in and year out for the Republican party and has so little to show for it.      In an oft cited quote Frank sums up the situation well &quot;Vote to stop abortion; receive a rollback in capital gains taxes. Vote to make our country strong again; receive deindustrialization. Vote to screw those politically correct college professors; receive electricity deregulation. Vote to get government off our backs; receive conglomeration and monopoly everywhere from media to meat-packing. Vote to stand tall against terrorists; receive Social Security privatization. Vote to strike a blow against elitism; receive a social order in which wealth is more concentrated than ever before in our lifetimes, in which workers have been stripped of power and CEOs are rewarded in a manner beyond imagining.&quot;      What Frank forgets is it doesn't always go according to plan. The Pat Robertson/Pat Buchanan insurgencies shook the Republican party and Buchanan deserves credit for a Republican congress voting for a raise in the minimum wage. Gary Bauer almost single handedly torpedoed Social Security privatization proposals in 1998. These achievements usually draw backhanded praise from the left, who are if anything more concerned with ideological purity than the &quot;religious right.&quot;      Frank decries the &quot;culture wars&quot; and fundamentalist zealots being sucked up into them, but he neglects the extent the left has been sucked up as well. While he discusses the DLC strategy of of hanging to abortion and gay rights as defining issues. He doesn't discuss how the NAACP's crusade against the confederate flag distracts from more substantial political and economic issues or how the &quot;anti-racist/diversity-valuing/multiculturalist&quot; politics of identity that so dominates academic discourse alienates the left from the very people who they purport to be in solidarity with. Nor does he mention the extent to which the Democratic party has systematically purged &quot;pro-life&quot; members from any public forum.       Nonetheless Frank deserves credit he show how &quot;social conservatives&quot; cannot be dismissed a mere racists. And he shows how they engaged in grassroots politics of the sort that unions and other &quot;progressive&quot; entities have forgotten or gotten too lazy to do.      The great unasked question is what would happen if we tried to reverse the formula Frank describes, what if by trying fighting media concentration we can stem the debasement of popular entertainment; by seeking to keep manufacturing at home, we can promote strong families; what if we had instant voter runoff or proportional represenation, christian conservatives wouldn't be stuck with the rotten &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; option that those on the left complain about; what if by forcing a debate on the virtues of the Market, we lead to a reconsideration of neo-Darwinism (and the Malthusian economics it rests upon).       In other words instead of just dismissing &quot;family values&quot; as a purely &quot;private concern&quot; we could frame them within the larger, menacing developments of the new, global economy. But such thinking is far beyond the average lefty who's busy arguing the merits of vegan versus lacto-ovo. This is a job the much maligned &quot;religious right&quot; may have to do. And as many of the best union songs used to be spirituals, so to there might be a rebirth a an real populism of the sort that set Kansas abaze a little over 100 years ago.	2004-07-29

Morrison Series in Southern Studies)	Books	5	17	18	N	N	You will never look at the Civil War the same way again...	It is a commonplace to speak of how quickly event move in our age, but I doubt events have ever so overwhelmed the nation the way the did between Oct 1859 and April 1861. In the beginning the sectional crisis seemed to have subsided and &quot;Black Republicanism&quot; was a tendency, easily overcome by the democratic party (or &quot;the Democracy&quot; as it was called). At the end, the war had begun and the battle was about to be joined. <br />Crofts book, focuses on the weeks between the election of Lincoln on Nov 6, 1860 and the proclamation calling up an army to subdue the rebel states on April 16, 1861. Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee initially and decisively defeated the drive towards secession only to be undone by being forced to choose between making war on fellow americans (and fellow southerners) or secession. <br />Crofts focuses on southern unionists, old Whigs for the most part, who participated in last minute negiations for a peaceful resolution of the crisis as well as William Seward and Stephen A. Douglas who were the chief go betweens. Previously historian like Kenneth Stampp have been dismissive of the efforts of the peace camp but Crofts build a compelling case for the legitimacy and viability of their negotiations and poses some difficult &quot;what if&quot; questions in the epilogue. <br />Like all good Civil War history, it will displease ideologues on both sides. It does not sanctify Lincoln or his course taken in rearming Fort Sumter and raising the army. While  the militant &quot;southern rights&quot; prosecession camp seem like so many demagogic hotheads (at least that is how they appeared to the Southern Unionists). <br />Also it is a remarkable analysis combining primary historical research and statistical methods and is path breaking in contributing to what Stephen Hahn refers to as a &quot;dissenter&quot; tradition in Southern politics. <br />Finally this book was inspired by David M. Potter's LINCOLN AND HIS PARTY IN THE SECESSION CRISIS. In the most recent edition Crofts has the introduction to this 1943 classic. Read the both and really get an education!	2004-04-04

Breckinridge was one of the most notable politicians of the 1850's, a confederate general serving in all theaters of the war, and a member of Jefferson Davis cabinet, playing a key role in negotiating the terms of surrender. <br />It is not too much to say that an examination of this one life can throught new clarifying light virtually all issues relating to the Civil War. From the Compromise of 1850, to the Kansas-Nebraska Act, to the Lecompton covention and the Dred Scott decision, the split of the Democratic convention in 1860, to the move toward secession, to the last ditch efforts for peaceful reconciliation, to the war itself, to the surrender of the armies of Northern Virginia and Tennessee, to the immediate aftermath Breckinridge was there frequently as a major player. <br />However, as much light as Breckinridge throws on these various issues, there are aspects about his career that remains troubling. While Davis protrays Breckinridge as a unionist and personally opposed to slavery, Breckinridge *continually* sides with the pro-slavery contingent in Congress. Whether it's Dred Scott, or Lecompton, or running on a rival &quot;southern rights&quot; platform to Douglas, Breckinridge is unerringly on the pro-slavery side. Breckinridge (and Davis) always have a reason (or an excuse) for a given position, but the overall pattern is clear. In the final analysis, it may have been Breckinridge's devotion to the &quot;right of property&quot; as being *absolute* and hence even *above* the constitution.<br />In any case Breckinridge's finest hour comes in the twilight of the confederacy when he serves briefly but effectively as Secretary of War and going behind Jeff Davis's back , who is border line delusional at this point, to negotiate with Lee and Johnston a plan of surrender to the Union. This story is one that Davis tells more fully in his HONORABLE DEFEAT and it cannot be understated that Breckinridge prevented the Confederacy from decending into guerillawarfare and banditry that would have lingered for years if not decades. <br />Also in the aftermath, Breckinridge takes principled stand in favor of accepting negro testimony in court and against the Ku Klux Kan in Kentucky. Toward the very end, his participation in the Lee memorial in Lexington KY throught light on the emergence of the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; mythology as Jubal Early will set up a competiting memorial in Lexington VA. (This smacks of different apparitions of the madonna during the Mexican revolution with the rebel adopting the lady of Guadalupe, while the government forces adopt Pilar.)<br />Finally this book, it has to be remembered that this book was written 30 years ago and while it's still valuable a lot has been published on the Army of Tennesee (particularly Pat Cleburn) and on the southern Unionists during the secession crisis. I think a revised edition that could take these recent developments into  account would be valuable.	2004-04-04

Kertzer has filled an important gap in our knowledge. <br />Kertzer takes his starting point with the Vatican document \\"We Remember\\" which distinguishes sharply between \\"racist\\" anti-semitism which led to the Holocaust and \\"theological\\" anti-semitism which was merely unfortunate and deplorable, but no bearing on the Church or her teachings. It furthermore, paints a picture of the Church bravely standing against fascism.<br />Needless to say Kertzer's research paints a different picture. Kertzer focuses on 3 instances of the vatican's dealing with temporal power: The treatment of jews in the papal states, The involvement with anti-semitic political parties in France, Austria, and Poland, and finally relations with the fascist regimes of Italy and Germany. <br />Apologists may seek to absolve the papacy as being powerless as to what Catholics may do in other countries, but this argument will not wash when one considers how it *did* run things in the papal states when it did have temporal power. Astonishingly, well past the \\"englightenment\\" into the nineteenth century, we see the Inquisition at work, infants kidnapped on the pretext that they had been baptized, compulsory sermons, walled in ghettos, severe restrictions on travel. More so than the France's Ancien Regime, the Vatican seemed to remember everything yet learn nothing from the French Revolution and Napoleon. With astonishing pig-headedness against all decency and common sense, it tries to continue to rule the papal states like it was still the thirteenth century. Not even Metternich, can reason with them!<br />With the collapse of the papal states and the consolidation of the Italian nation, the vatican does what it does best--strike out at enemies real and imagined--in this case, \\"jewish freemasonry\\" (the favorite boogie man of traditionalist catholics to this day). Vatican institutions and publications play a major part in reviving the \\"blood libel\\" beginning with the Damascus case of the 1840's, in promoting the idea of an international jewish conspiracy to take over the world, blaming jews for both capitalism and socialism, condeming jewish relgion and spreading lies about the Talmud not to mention the old standbys of deicide and \\"irrational\\" hatred of christians and christianity. True the Vatican may not have had a hand in originating \\"racial\\" anti-semitism, but it promoted everything else. <br />Figures such as Eduard Drumont and Karl Lueger are seen in a new light by the relationship (however difficult) that the church maintained with them both.<br />Finally, there is the dealings with Mussolini and Hitler. Yes, relations with frequently strained. Yes, there was \\"neopaganism\\" in fascist ideology. Yes, the Vatican did oppose certain actions of the fascists states. But the Vatican's opposition was narrow and legalistic, focusing only on various concordats and on the issue of baptised jews, while saying nothing about the jews as a whole.<br />Again we see the distinction that we find in \\"We Remember\\" between racial anti-semitism and theological antisemitism, only this time the latter is upheld as entirely legitimate. And while the Church cannot be said to have preached genocide, it is hard to escape that no one single entity did so much to promote hatred of Jews.<br />I found this book to be engrossing. On every page I found myself saying \\"oh my god!\\" I was left with the impression that the fault did not lay with Pius XII was not his alone, but one with an institution for which all attempts to reform will be too little, too late.	2003-08-25

This book forms the third in a trilogy including TOWARD A JEWISH THEOLOGY OF LIBERATION and BEYOND INNOCENCE AND REDEMPTION. This is the most personal of the three. Starting and refering back to a trip he made to Auschwitz as part of a conference of scholars. He gives great personal detail as to his own spiritual journey. His deep if complicated relationship with Richard Rubenstein, the author of the now legendary AFTER AUSCHWITZ, which along with Elie Wiesel's NIGHT, initiated \\"holocaust theology.\\"<br />Along the way he ties Auschwitz with 1492 and the multiple genocides of indigenous peoples since. Reflects on the essential continuity between the \\"Christ of Faith\\" and the Constantinian transformation. Attempts to reclaim, insight from the cultural/binational Zionism of  Ahad Ha'am, Judah L. Magnes, and Hannah Arendt. Tries to visualize an all inclusive vision of Judaism.<br />Ellis ranges widely, especially considering that the book is only 162 pages long. Needless to say there are omissions and missteps. While focusing on Auschwitz and 1492, Ellis neglects the Crusades as another catastrophic turning point of western history. Not only does the subject bring in Muslim greivance toward Christianity, but the event marked a new outbreak in anti-Semitism that characterized the second millenium, as well as greatly heightened persecution of homosexuals, heretics and \\"witches.\\" In short, an event at least as great as Constantine.<br />The connection he draws between \\"the Christ of Faith\\" and Constantine is just asserted. True, \\"reformers\\" are too glib in trying to separate the Church from \\"abuses.\\" But Ellis, fails to lay out his version of how a group persecuted by empire, became part of the empire and why it was an inevitable development. As for asserting that 1492 \\"benefitted\\" the Church. Is this true? Much of the current growth in Asia and Africa is quite indigenous and pentecostalism is the big phenomenon in Latin America.<br /> In critiquing the \\"Christ of Faith\\" he falls back on Crossan's THE HISTORICAL JESUS as though Crossan presents the last word on \\"the Jesus of History\\" (as though such a thing were possible). He seems unaware that his reconstruction of \\"Jesus as a peasant cynic\\" is widely disputed. Reconstructions are ever subject to revision and in the end as Schweizer showed, seem to tell more about the author than the subject. As for his all inclusive view of Judaism, he tries to affirm the pagan practices by Ancient Israelites condemned by the \\"establishment\\" prophets. Strange that the \\"establishment\\" prophets were often the subject of persecution (e.g. jeremiah and isaiah). While the \\"popular\\" pagan practices seem to follow courtly fashion.<br />Most troubling is that for a \\"theology\\" there is almost nothing said concerning God. (In BEYOND INNOCENCE AND REDEMPTION absolutely nothing is said.) But Ellis's journey is far from over. In just the last few weeks, Ellis has delivered a lecture on \\"the Prophetic: Hope of God, Hope of Humanity\\" that embraces and declares the need for \\"God Talk.\\"<br />With his mentor Rubenstein I too \\"find everything Marc Ellis writes to be a 'must read'...especially when I disagree with him.\\"	2003-06-14

Books on Shakespeare roughly seem to fall into two categories: Standard scholarly books that downplay the man and focus on the plays and ingenious, entertianing books by frequently learned amateurs of anti-stratfordian theories of authorship. Anti-stratfordians have an advantage with the popular reading public; whereas academics are content to deal with texts as if they have no referents, laypeople necessarily have to ask (as William Paley said in his \\"natural theology) what kind of man wrote these plays. Anti-stratfordians are all too willing to oblige.<br /> Furthermore the field is fairly well uncontested as practically all academics consider anti-stratfordian theories as beneath their contempt. This is a shame because generally they are entirely worthy of contempt. Ian Wilson is educated amateur, with the sort of background one associates with anti-stratfordians. He summarizes and interprets the available evidence and comes to some remarkable conclusions. <br /> Best of all, his is not an \\"anti-anti-stratfordian rant\\" he concentrates on considering the \\"stratford man\\" not knocking other candidates. But the position of there being an \\"authorship problem\\" is made untenable. Particularly when read in conjuction with Matus' SHAKESPEARE IN FACT which addresses subsequent assessments of shakespeare (culminating in romantic \\"bardolatry\\") as well as a dissection of the claims for Oxford. This even though there are plenty of \\"arguably\\"'s, \\"almost certian\\"'s, \\"likely\\"'s that stud the text which the loyal opposition will make much of. <br />The one substantian objection is that Wilson argues for the likelihood of a position (for example the identity of the \\"dark lady\\") and then frequently treats it as establish fact. This is a chief vice of anti-strafordians A few more qualifiers would have enhanced the book's credibility.	2003-01-09

This edition is an updated version of the authors earlier book written in the wake of the 1996 Anti-Terrorism Act. Remember that Act? That was the one passed in response to Oklanhoma City and gave \\"sweeping new powers\\" to federal authorities, so that such a horrible act of terrorism, would never, ever, never, never happen ever again!<br />Now with 9/11 and the \\"Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism\\" (U.S.A.P.A.T.R.I.O.T) Act (how much time, do you suppose, does it take to come with these acronyms?), the authors are back with a critical look at a drive towards what has very little to do with counterterrorism and quite a bit to do with increasing and centralizing power.<br />In the past 12 months we've had proposals for a national ID card, a missle defense system, legalized torture, suspension of writ of habeas corpus, a \\"homeland security\\" infrastructure that is heavily reliant on security technologies of dubious value. Basically the only thing that has changed that would have prevented the 9/11 are locked Cabin doors and the newfound general awareness that \\"cooperating with the hijacker\\" might not be the best policy for passeners.<br />Also along the way, a steady trickle of stories of missed opportunities, ignored warning and frustrated investingations have come out regarding the FBI and others to use the powers they already do have.<br />The bulk of the book deals with FBI misdeed during the Cold War and proposes an unfashionable counterrorism strategy that emphasizes the responsibility of actors, not ideology. Basically, trying to treat terrrorism as a crime not as war.<br />The proposals are a little narrow. Terrorism of the sort represented by al Quaeda is international, not just national. The fight against it will share more with racketeering and global criminal networks. And a world court is needed. I'm not sure if dealing on a purely \\"case-by-case\\" basis will do the trick.<br />Nevertheless, the authors have offered a well reasoned case and in the current climate when we are asked to give up so much with only the assurance of \\"trust us\\" we would do to heed their call.	2002-10-20

This book gives new meaning to the phrase \\"cult classic.\\" Published in the early 1960's it deals with one of the great \\"cause celebres\\" in Israeli history--the Kastner affair--which remains almost wholly unknown in the english speaking world. <br /> In brief, the story goes like this, Malchiel Greenwald charged Kastner with collaboration in Hungary. Kastner at the behest of the Ben Gurion government sued for libel. Alas Greenwald's attorney, Shmuel Tamir staged a spirited defense and the honor of established Zionist organizations during the Holocaust was challenged. Kastner lost the libel suit, appealed, lost again. And when faced with the possibility of being convicted under Israel's anti-collaboration law (the one Eichmann was convicted under), he was convenient \\"assasinated.\\"<br /> Along the way Hecht shares many stories just beginning to be written about in english including Rabbi Michael Dov Weissmandl's \\"Europa Plan\\" and the death of Hanah Szenes. As well as his rather celebratory accounts of Irgun terrorists against the British in Palestine. (I use the term not in condemnation, Irgunists routinely embraced it)<br /> There are many levels in which this book can be read. It can be appreciated as a polemic against the establishment zionism of Weizmann and Ben-Gurion. It can be read as a powerful cautionary tale against nation-states. It can be read as a despairing anguished cry over a humanity that seems hell-bent for nuclear annihilation.<br /> The value for all people who care about the State of Israel is that this was the first--and for a long time only--comprehensive account of this defining moment in Israeli history.<BR>To this very day, public airing of this controversy in english, is discouraged. Jim Allen sought to dramatize the story in his play PERDITION and, in 1987, was twice shut down by major Jewish organizations and was subjected to a libel action by a minor figure in a telling re-play of the original Kastner affair. The action was not sustained,a reading of the play was put on at a community center. (A full account can be found in Uri Davis's book CROSSING THE BORDER.) <br /> On the other hand, Hecht is so close to his subject. Everything is black and white. While he celebrates Irgun actions against the British, he has nothing to say concerning actions against the Palestinians. The name Deir Yassin is never mentioned.<br />Likewise, by Hecht's reckoning it was the Irgun, and the Irgun only that won palestine for the jewish state. But the establishment of Israel was not just a military triumph but a diplomatic one as well. Without Weizmann cultivating the British and Ben Gurion cultivating the US, there would have been no Balfour declaration, no mandate for the establishment for a jewish state at Versailles, no US support for UN partition, and no US instantaneous recognition for Israel in 1948.<br /> In the interest of balance, it is probably a good idea to compare his account with the relevant section in Tom Segev's THE SEVENTH MILLION. Also for a fuller account of Weissmandl activities and his charges against the established Zionist organizations see THE UNHEEDED CRY. For a scholarly, critical account of rescue efforts and charges of zionist non-cooperation one should see Yehuda Bauer's JEWS FOR SALE.

With the assasination of Rabin, the advent of suicide/homicide bombings, the new intifada, and collapse of peace talks at Camp David and Taba, \\"Peace Now\\" is now a shadow of its former self and its not hard to meet disillusioned Israelis who once supported its goals but now want nothing to do with it.<br />The fact was and is that \\"Peace Now\\" while broad in its heydey was very shallow in its position. Together with Meretz and Labor \\"doves\\" they sought friendship first and justice toward the Palestinians later; not realizing that that it could only be justice first and then friendship. This crucial misunderstanding defines the failure of the traditional peace groups/parties in Israel. (The fact that they scrupulously avoided ever criticized Israeli government policy.)<br />Fortunely there still is a hard core of \\"peaceniks.\\" At perhaps 20-30% of the population they are a minority, but they are a substantial minority. The groups they make up include \\"Gush-Shalom\\" the hard core \\"Peace Bloc\\" which calls for a two state solution and a sharing of Jerusalem, \\"Ometz Lesarev\\" (\\"Courage to Refuse\\") the conditional objector movement of reservists who refuse to serve in the occupied territories, Rabbis for Human Rights, B'Tselem the Palestian-Israeli human rights organization, Ta'Ayush the cooperative movement of young people of Jewish and Arabic backgrounds participating in non-violent direct action and reliefl efforts in the occupied territories, the Campaign against Home Demolitions, the Women in Black, among others.<br />This anthology covers a generous cross section this opinion, not usually covered in the US media: from \\"new historian\\" Avi Schlaim, to veteran \\"muckraker\\" Uri Avnery, to hard hitting journalists Tanya Rheinhart and Amira Hass, to several members of the \\"refuser\\" movements. The contents of the this book will challenge many recieved notions that govern the coverage of Israel/Palestine in the US media, including the nature of the occupation, the bad faith with which Oslo was carried out, the true responsibility for the failures at Camp David and Taba.<br />The editors strove for comprehensiveness, but I still can think of two glaring omissions: Ran HaCohen whose column \\"Letter from Israel\\" appears (and is archived) on antiwar.com, and Stephen Langfur, author of CONFESSION FROM A JERICHO JAIL, who was a precursor of the \\"Ometz\\" movement and is presently editor for Challenge Magazine, where his continuing work on the rights and conditions of Arab workers and their role in the context of globalization is quite remarkable. There is also something of a generational bias in the selection, material from Ta'ayush and Between the Lines magazine are unaccounted for. While biographies for the contributors are included in the back of the book a list of organizations and websites is not. Shame!<br />Several other caveats, little in this book is new to anyone who is \\"up\\" on the Peace movement in Israel. Indeed most of this material is availabe online at the websites of gush-shalom, seruv.org, the Israel Committe Against Home Demolitions, globalresearch.ca. It's there if you know where to look, on the other hand its very convenient to have it all in one place.<br />Also, the pieces in this volume are very much of the moment, hence it will of necessity become very dated, very quickly. Still for anyone who doesn't know that there is a peace movement in Israel (or worse still that it died in 2000) this book will be an an excellent starting point. Get one for yourself and another for the next person you meet how goes of on how Arafat \\"walked away\\" from \\"Barak's generous offer.\\"	2002-09-25

BUT THERE IS SO, SO MUCH HE MISSES! What about the role of \\"house churches.\\" Where is the discussion of Watchman Nee, Roland Allen, Lesslie Newbigin, Bahkt Singh... How can one hope to deal with churches in the Muslim world without reference to Phil Parshall or Kenneth Cragg.<br />About his chapter on the muslim world, the less said, the better!<BR>While early on, he makes an important point against Samuel Huntington's currently fashionable \\"Clash of Civilizations\\" theory, in the relevant chapter, he swallows it hook, line, and sinker. Indeed, he introduces as \\"evidence,\\" stuff not even Huntington and Daniel Pipes would cite: namely, the turkish genocide against armenians, and turkish actions against greek orthodox. What wrong with this picture? The Turkey was led by the very militant (and very secular) Kemalists at the time! But no bother every ethnic conflict is reduced to a religous conflict, whether it's the balkans (how devout is Milosevich, really?) or East Timor. <br />Yes, there is persecution of Christian minorities in Muslim nations and missionary activity is resisted, sometimes agressively. And yes, this will continue for the forseeable future. But it's just plain stupid to equate the Taleban with Suharto or Alia Itzabegovich!<br />Then to add insult to injury, he mentions how many christians in the muslim world are critical of the State of Israel, raising, without *any* support whatsoever, the specter of retrograde christian anti-Semitism reinforced by Islamic anti-Semitism. What's breathtaking, is how lightly he writes such a libel and then moves on, but then that's the book in a nutshell. Literate, but profoundly superficial.	2002-06-16

It concentrates on the give and take of the political process. While the military aspect is subordinate in this account, there are all too many books that concentrate on the military history of Civil War to the exclusion of everything else.

Like Early, he maintained that the war had not been about slavery at all, but states rights. Like Early, he would maintain that the South was not defeated but only overwhelmed but vastly superior numbers of men and material. Unlike Early, he downplayed the struggle between northern industrial capital and southern landed gentry and he gave the myth a conciliatory twist perfectly suited to the capital hungry \\"new south.\\" For decades he would dazzle memorial day audiences, with a speech arguing that *both* sides of the \\"war between the states\\" were right and *both* sides won( the North preserved the union and the South preserved \\"honor\\").

When I was a teenager, all I knew about the 1948 \\"war of independence\\" was what I saw in the movie \\"Exodus\\" with Paul Newman and what I read in the World Book Encyclopedia entry.<br />In that movie the Zionist wanted nothing more than to live in peace with their Arab neighbors, but the \\"arab neighbors\\" like children following the pied piper of Hamelin, left their homes (and all their earthly belongings) at the word of radio broadcasts from \\"Arab High Command\\". (It didn't occur to me to ask why not let them back once they came to their senses.)<br />From the World Book encyclopedia, I was told that all the surrounding arab countries declared war on Israel within the hour of it's \\"declaration of independence\\" and their armies invaded with single minded aim of destroying the country. Israel, against incredible odds, triumphed over all an as an added bonus ended up with 78% of Palestine, instead of the 52% provided for in the UN partition. (What Luck!)<br />Michael Palumbo, who previously got the goods on Kurt Waldheim's wartime record, followed up by writing this history from UN archival sources, Palestinian sources, and Israeli diaries and memiors (frequently more reliable than Israeli military and intelligence archives).<br />No matter how much you think you know about the middle east, how much of a critic of Israel you might be, this book will make you angry. Angry over the continuing injustice, angry over the continuing lies, angry over the continuing manipulation of western opinion (particularly US opinion), angry over the impotence of the newly formed UN. <br />In this book you will learn that the Palestinians did not leave because they were ordered to, on the contrary Arab radio broadcasts demanded that they *stay.* The Palestinians left, because they were terrorized, coerced, and, when all else failed, forced out. The Zionist movement never had any intention of living in peace with \\"their arab neighbors.\\" From the very beginning (even before Herzl), they intended to claim the entire land for a Jewish State, and would only tolerate the smallest Arab minority possible. The Arab states declared war, but the fighting had started with the partition a year earlier. Their intervention was half-hearted at best and was never meant to destroy Israel (e.g. they never entered in the \\"jewish part\\" of the partition.)<br />Reading this at this time will give the uncanny sense of deja vu.<BR>You'll find the systematic use of looting and wanton vandalism of palestinian homes and businesses. The same manipulation of opinion. (On the one hand, denying access because of fight. On the other hand denying atrocities, because there's \\"no evidence.\\"<BR>The destruction of houses with people still in them (by dynamite, not by bulldozers tho').<br />Also there's Menachem Begin's role in the massacre of Deir Yassin and Yitzak Shamir's role in the assasination of UN mediator Folke Bernadotte. (Keep in mind next time you hear Yassir Arafat a \\"terrorist.\\")<br />The overwhelming feeling will be \\"how can we have been so lied to for so long.\\" <br />How indeed?	2002-06-02

It would be easy to accuse Churchill of knocking down strawmen, except that many dogmatic pacifists *are* that pie in the sky, refusing to do *anything* remotely confrontational.<br /> After having dismissed the classic examples of success by pointing out how they did not live up to the ideal, he proceeds to assert the right to self-defense, which all but the most dogamtic would accept, and then by with a logicaly jump, concludes with a thumping assertion of \\"armed struggle\\" (i.e. the Jacobin-Blaquist conspiritorial model of a \\"revolutionary vanguard\\").<br />It's easy to poke holes in a position, particularly one so given to absolutist, sweeping pronouncements as pacifism; it's harder to ask what really works. Non-violent direct action is a means to change the potential of which has yet to be fully realized. *YES* it is not applicable in any and all situations. *YES* people have a legal and moral right to self-defense. *YES* non-violent campaigns are rarely, if ever *perfectly* non-violent. None of this takes away from the efficacy of non-violence in many if not most situations. <br /> The irony is that Churchill's book doesn't mention the most interesting characters and events that severely qualify \\"non-violent successes\\" He doesn't mention Robert Williams (NEGROES WITH GUNS) tactical excercise of his 2nd Amendment rights against the KKK in the late 1950's. He doesn't mention Subhas Chandra Bose, Gandhi's most trenchant critic. No real thorough examination of the strengths and limitations of non-violence as a strategy and tactic, just hoary sloganeering of \\"new left\\" (turned old) cliches from AIM and the Black Panthers. <br />While so sweeping in its condemnation of non-violence, Churchill fails to examine the failings of the \\"vanguardists\\": the ease with which \\"central committees\\" were inflitrated, the factionalism unto fratricide,the lack of any constructive achievements of any kind. <br />Yeah, there's a lot to criticize in pacifism, but there are people who are working with non-violent strategy and tactics which fully accepting the right of self-defense (e.g. the International Solidarity Movement) and are finding out from *praxis,* not pre-concieved ideological commitments, what works and what doesn't.<br />Any serious critique should take Gene Sharp, Robert Williams and Brian Martin into account, this doesn't and isn't.	2002-05-16

Many of the people who laughed at Maddox *were* no better than him and Maddox, it turned out, was better than quite of few.<br />Maddox became governor of GA, with the support of the Citizens' Councils and the K.K.K. largely on the strength of his confrontation at his restaurant the &quot;Pickrick&quot; with civil rights demonstrators in 1964. By the end of his tenure, Maddox had appointed more african americans, reformed the prison system, and raised teachers salaries.<br />But this isn't a case of a repentant demagogue, like George Wallace, or a wily politician who trimmed his sails, like Strom Thurmond. Lester Maddox *was*, and is, a segregationist. The fact that he would close the &quot;Pickrick&quot; rather than integrate and then make the appointments he did was no contradiction to him. When confronted, he would just shrug and say &quot;I just got the best people for the job.&quot; Despite this, Maddox never got substantial black support, like Wallace or Thurmond, but then he never sought it, either.<br />Admirers may bemoan Maddox being remember only for the &quot;pick axe handles incident,&quot; where he handed out ax handles to &quot;Pickrick&quot; patrons to back him up in the aforementioned &quot;confrontation.&quot; But its hard not to, considering how he used to glory in its memory years afterward. Selling autographed ax handles in his gift shop in underground Atlanta. To this day, Maddox apologizes for nothing.<br /> Maddox's racial attitudes are old fashioned, fotunately his commitment to honesty, industry, thrift, and fair play were old fashioned as well. &quot;Good government&quot; for him, was not just code for &quot;white supremacy.&quot; On balance he was a good governor. With a little humility and willingness to meet people on terms other than those he dictated, he *could* have been great.<br /> The advantage of Short's book is that is the closest we will probably get to an autobiography. By the same token, Short is too close to his subject and his sources are mainly current and retired pols, many former Maddox associates. Short is not exactly, uncritical, but he doesn't probe much either. Maddox is a plain, simple man, seemingly without guile, but the times in which he lived and the phenomenon of his public life, were anything but.

This book focuses on a neglected chapter of reconstrution, the period of &quot;presidential recontruction&quot; which preceded &quot;congressional&quot; or &quot;radical recontruction.&quot; Carter gives a detailed picture based almost entirely on primary sources of the south immediately after the civil war and the hosts of dilemmas  that confront both the region and the nation as a whole. In the process, Carter gives the most sympathetic picture of southern conservatives who lead reconstruction efforts since the school of Dunning, perhaps since Dunning himself. In contrast to the characterization of them being unreconstructed rebels, Carter illustrates that while many of them were confederates, most were reluctant confederates who either opposed secession until after the election of Lincoln or until their states seceded. (Contrary to unionist myth making at the time, the bulk of white southerners were not &quot;straight-sect&quot; unionists, oppressed by a miniscule &quot;slavocracy.&quot; After war's end there was just not enough of them to reestablish elected government.) <br /> Indeed this book it almost a companion piece to Croft's RELUCTANT CONFEDERATES, as most of these &quot;conservatives&quot; were old whigs and constitutional unionist, just as Croft's subjects, who were conscious of the south's backwardness before the war and dreamed of south with manufacturing, infrastructure, diversified agriculture, and public education. To all advocates of the &quot;failure of southern leadership&quot; to explain everything that's gone wrong with the region since antebellum, Carter makes a compelling case, that these were the best, most far sighted men the south could have chosen. <br /> But in Carter's book, this is almost to damn them with faint praise for as a group they are blinkered by notions of negro inequality, &quot;the sanctity of debt&quot;, and a positive horror of confiscation. As the south refuses to be suitably &quot;penitent&quot; for their past sins ofslavery and secession as well as enacting &quot;black codes&quot; that, at best, make freedmen &quot;wards of the state&quot; and less than truly free, the north becomes more  open-ended in their demands for re-admission to the union. Carter's &quot;old whigs&quot; end up being overcome, as &quot;reasonable, moderate&quot; men often do, by inexorable events, losing support in the south *and* the north.<br /> Along the way Carter illustrates the collapse of social order, familiar to any observer of South Africa after aparthied or Russia after communism, interracial conflict, especially fears of an black insurrection to confiscate land, the debate over &quot;wartime debts,&quot; strangely pertinent today with the issue of &quot;third world debt,&quot; not to mention the difficult (and not wholly successful) transition from slave labor to free labor, which ultimately results in the tenant/sharecropping system. In sum this book presents what Barabara Tuchman would call &quot;a distant mirror&quot;, not with contemporary U.S.  but the *world* at the turn of the millenium.<br /> Carter writes excellently and as mentioned above depends heavily on primary materials. This does however bias the books perceptions toward the perceptions of conservatives, the &quot;mobs&quot; of white southerns demanding debt relief or the unionist who rather liked the idea of confiscation of plantation lands, have little or no voice in the debate. (They left little in the way of personal letters or published opinion, and even less that found its way into a university collection.) Hence in his conclusion, Carter glumly writes that while their were options &quot;not all things were possible.&quot; Without a doubt, but by seeing things through elite southerners eyes, Carter seems to limit the range of possibilities to what was acceptable to *them.*<br /> Perhaps, political theorists and historians expect too much from leaders. Perhaps at this time the wisest course was one, unthinkable to the old&quot;whigs&quot; but endorsed by a nameless north GA farmer after reconstruction. &quot;We could've tuk the land. Split it. Gi'n some to the [freedmen], 'n' some to me 'n' t'other union fellers.&quot; (Quoted in McMath's AMERICAN POPULISM)<br /> A program of debt relief, land re-distribution (to whites and blacks alike), public education, and federal investment in infrastructure (like that promised by the Hayes administration as part of the compromise of 1877, but never enacted) would have gone a long way to both &quot;binding up the wounds&quot; *and* guaranteeing equal rights for african americans. But that's hindsight speaking...	2001-07-05

One of the aspects about the Civil War that usually goes unnoticed is that it is unlike almost all civil wars in human history. Such conflicts are usually, inter-communal, not sectional and protracted, lasting for decades and leaving behind old grudges to be nursed until fighting resumes. Think Lebanon, Northern Ireland, and the former Yugoslavia and you get the idea. By comparison, the end of the Civil War was quick and final. No wholesale execution of political and military leaders, not even confiscation of property. The issue of secession never seriously raised thereafter. For all the controversy over confederate symbols, we shouldn't wonder why there is so much bitterness over the war, we should wonder why there is so little.<br /> Two books have appeared this year, within one month of one another that address this very aspect: APRIL 1865 by Jay Winik and AN HONORABLE PEACE by William Davis. Winik is a senior scholar at University of Maryland's School of Public Policy and frequent columnist in the Wall Street Journal. This is his first venture into Civil War history. (His previous book ON THE BRINK is a popular account of the end of the cold war.) Davis on the other hand, is program director of the Virginia Center for Civil War studies and a veteran Civil War historian with literally dozens of books on the subject to his credit. <br /> Winik takes a big picture approach and paints with broad strokes on a broad canvas. The picture that emerges is that of disaster overcome with high-mindedness and commitment to the common good on the part of virtually all major participants. To begin with, Winik describes several probable (to him, at least) scenarios with the South continuing the war, chiefly the use of partisans like Mosby's Rangers who could (supposedly) live off the land and harass Federal troops at will. This together with the possibilties of foreign intervention render the Confederacy defeat less than certain, according to Winik. But providentially, Lee, whocould not bear the sword against his native state, would not prolong the fight by letting it degenerate into guerilla warfare. Grant, in turn, refuses Lee's sword and let's his men keep their horses. It's almost all too good to be true.<br />  Davis, by contrast, focuses on two individuals, both members of the confederate government: Jefferson Davis, the president, and John C. Breckinridge, his Secretary of War. Davis is uniquely qualified to write this story as the author of the standard biography of Breckinridge (BRECKINRIDGE: STATESMAN, SOLDIER, SYMBOL) and an authoritative biography of Davis (JEFFERSON DAVIS: THE MAN AND HIS HOUR), not to mention the definitive history of the confederate government A GOVERNMENT OF OUR OWN. <br /> Davis, a man of great experience and ability, insisted on micro-managing the war, would listen only to yes men, and was scuttled all talk of peace negotiations unless independence was accepted. With the evacuation from Richmond, his grip on the government (and indeed with reality) begins to slip. Overwhelmed by circumstances he issues proclamations to continue the fight that don't get outside of Danville VA. He calls meetings of cabinet officials, but when gathered has nothing to tell them. The similarity with Hitler in the bunker is striking. <br /> All the while power shifts to Breckinridge, made Secretary of War less than four months prior. Breckinridge, realizes from the outset that the situation is hopeless, yet he sets about his task of supporting the war effort. Within weeks, Lee says that his men were never so well supplied in months. As events unfold, Breckinridge, takes the initiative (unlike Davis, he's come up with contingency plans), oversees the evacution of Richmond (including the confederate archives, thus putting himself in every Civil War historian's debt), makes contact with Lee when succesive scouts fail to return.<br /> Davis builds a compelling case that Breckinridge was instrumental in Lee's decision to surrender,they had been of one mind as to the hopelessness since January. His overriding concern during his all too brief tenure as Secretary of War was that &quot;this has been a magnificent epic, let it not end in a farce.&quot; As a result of his efforts the confederacy surrenders as a defeated, but sovereign nation, not piecemeal like a fail revolt. It mantains a sense of honor.<br /> Unlike Winik, Davis gives little credence to the possibility of continuing the war by adopting guerilla tactics. As Davis points out, no guerrilla effort has ever succeeded without outside help and the confederacy had none. As for &quot;living off the land&quot; that would have meant withdrawing into Appalachia, which was a hotbed of unionism. It could have prolonged the conflict, but defeat would have been no less sure and partisans would regress into banditry as they had in Missouri (with the James boys and the Younger brothers being only the most notable example).<br /> Furthermore there is more ambiguity in Davis's book. Whereas, Winik concludes with an anecdote concerning Lee taking communion next to a black man as the true end of the civil war. Davis gives an account of a people &quot;bloodied, but unbowed&quot;, one that is determined to reclaim as much of what they have lost as possible. There is no facile happy ending, but one can not help but admire these men and their sense of honor.<br />  To date, Winik's book is exceedingly well publicized (his connections to WSJ are no doubt standing him in good stead) and is garnering praise from all quarters. Davis book while well recieved is not getting the notice it might have had it not been swamped in the wake of Winik's book. <br /> Let this not suggest that Davis's book is &quot;academic&quot;. It reads with the drama and movement of a novel. The story is a noble and tragic one, rather like Antigone seeking a decent burial for her father.<br /> In sum, if you want a warm, fuzzy picture, stick with Winik. If you really want to understand why and how it happened, read Davis.	2001-06-06

I wonder how many people who react to this book have even *read* the table of contents, much less the text? If they had they would know that Yoder, devotes a chapter to Romans 13 and another to the household codes (in 1 Peter as well as some of Paul's letters).<br /> Yoder does concentrate on Luke's gospel, but to bring in the other gospels would only strengthen his case. (The sermon on the mount is in Matthew's gospel, after all.) To bring in the O.T. is to criticize Yoder for not writing a different book, he was writing the POLITICS OF JESUS, not THE POLITICS OF THE BIBLE. But, in any case, all such objects are dealt with in Millard Lind's book YAHWEH IS A WARRIOR. But such simple-minded anabaptist biblicism is probably more than certain high church prigs can bear.	2001-06-05

Bercot has forged a damning critique of contemporary evangelicalism, a movement which once cherished it's &quot;separation&quot; from the world and now apes every passing marketing fad through &quot;christian rock music,&quot; &quot;christian romance novels,&quot; &quot;christian financial advise,&quot; &quot;christian self-help&quot; (e.g. MEN ARE FROM ISRAEL, WOMEN ARE FROM MOAB) etc. <br />Evangelicals who once prided themselves on being &quot;not conformed to this world&quot; have seemingly replaced the Episcopal Church for being &quot;the Republican party at prayer.&quot; <br />In sum evangelialism is not a church, nor is it even movement anymore. Evangelicalism is now a niche market and a somewhat marginal political constituency (one to be manipulated in biennial crusades against the godless &quot;secular humanist liberals&quot; only to dismissed when the election is over an governing has to take place.)<br />It is no wonder why Bercot has stirred up such a hornet's nest in some circles.<br />In addition to the overdue sizing up of evangelicalism, this book is valuable in serving to stimulate interest in Patristics (the study of the church fathers). I am particularly grateful for the space he gives to Origen, the church's most brilliant intellect before Augustine.<br />Perhaps most importantly he reminds us that Chritian life is not a one-on-one proposition (the usual interpretation of having &quot;a personal relationship with Jesus Christ&quot;), but one done in Community. This cannot be emphasized enough.<br />This being said several notes of caution must be sounded. <br /> First, reconstructing the church from the early fathers is a little like trying to reconstruct U.S. history with only back issues of the New York Times Op-Ed page to go on. You can derive a lot, but the picture will be distorted and tendentious and incomplete. Attention needs to be given to New Testament Apocrypha and, yes, heretical and pagan writings need to help fill out of picture (although it will still be incomplete).<br /> Secondly, it is just plain wrong to say that the faith and the church was an unchanging affair for at least the first 3 or 4 centuries. Reading the fathers shows us considerable change, however unacknowledge. The first century church was one of spiritual gifts and prophecy. Towards the end of the first century into the early second century the office of the bishop become established (largely at the insistence of Ignatius of Antioch).During the second century, veneration of martyrs and increasing emphasis on the Mother Mary developes.  By the third century, infant baptism becomes accepted practice. Along the way also presbyters become &quot;priests,&quot; bishops in major cities become &quot;patriarchs and the role of women become much diminished. *All* of this is very clear from the historical record (see Ronald Kydd's book on spiritual gifts in the early church and Ben Witherington's on women in the earliest churches.<br /> Even on crucial doctrines of the Trinity and Incarnation, it must be admitted that these doctrines developed (or if you prefer *refined*) over the course of centuries and what would have been &quot;orthodox&quot; in the third century would be &quot;heretical&quot; in the fourth.<br />Thirdly, Bercot makes much of the fact that the Church Fathers were nearer in time to the apostles, but I would argue that it is entirely possible for contemporary scholarship in certain cases to have insight into New Testament teachings that were unavailable to the Church Fathers, particularly considering the fact that *all* the Fathers were gentiles and most of the New Testament writers were jews.<br />Fourthly, Bercot scores some points against Luther and Calvin. Concerning this, I can only say that Luther is not easily dismissed with a few stray quotes. Anyone who thinks he understands Luther on the first reading is almost certainly wrong. Further justification by faith has stronger biblical bases than Bercot might think (see Frank Thielman's PAUL AND THE LAW and Thomas Schreiner's book on the subject). <br /> As for Calvin, the current teaching of &quot;eternal security&quot; of salvation as something of a &quot;spiritual tattooing&quot; (something done as a youthful indiscretion on wild weekend and then indelibly part of the person for the rest of their life), is a complete travesty of Calvin and Calvinist teaching on &quot;perserverance of the saints.&quot; Calvin, the Puritans, and Jonathan Edwards, with their concentration on sanctification would be as horrified as anyone over this teaching of &quot;once saved, always saved.&quot;<br />So in conclusion, keep in mind the limitations as well as the strengths of the Church Fathers. Read other books like J.N.D. Kelly and Thomas Oden on the Early Church. But with all else, &quot;test the spirits.&quot;<br />Finally to those who ask &quot;Sola *sic* Origen, Sola *sic* Tertullian, Sola *sic* Policarp *sic*...&quot; they should ask how many are their beliefs are based &quot;Solo Calvin, Solo Luther, Solo Lewis Sperry Chafer.&quot;	2001-03-31

As Schweizer observed around 90 years ago, reconstructions of the historical Jesus by liberal theologians tend to be self-portraits. Not so Morton Smith! True, he had an axe to grind. True, he let his speculations outrun his evidence. True, he was one-sided. But his portrait is not merely a face at the bottom of the well.<br />He sought to reconstruct the image of Jesus according to early pagan and jewish opponents and the image they give is  consistently that of a magician. *None* disputed the accounts of miracles. (Let all contemporary advocates of &quot;Jesus the Great Humanistic  Teacher of Ethics&quot; take note.)<br />Morton Smith was an *advocatus diabolis&quot; in the best sense of the word. It is petty for some to criticize his approach, when he almost alone sought to take seriously the miraculous aspects of the Gospels without merely taking them at face value. True he moves from merely presenting the pagan/jewish case for &quot;Jesus as magician&quot; to asserting it as the *true* picture. And he undercuts his own argument against the distinction between magic and religion as false by then basically arguing that &quot;Jesus was *really* a magician&quot; (and by implication not really a religious figure).<br />Aside from his suggestions of homosexuality (*one* accusation, never leveled by pagan and jewish critics) there is much ammunition for conservatives to use against the &quot;Jesus Seminar&quot; types. From suggestions that Paul *might* have known the historical Jesus to the seriousness Smith gives to the narrative Gospels (including John!) Smith is no mere &quot;demythologizer.&quot;	2001-03-14

The thesis is that *ha-eretz* in Genesis 1 refer to &quot;the promised land,&quot; hence the days of creation refer to &quot;palestine&quot; not the the Cosmos. He cites several sages (most notably Rashi and Ibn Ezra) and 17th century biblical scholar John Lightfoot.<br />He cites a text in Jeremiah, which alludes to the earth becoming &quot;void and without form&quot; etc... This is a &quot;proof text&quot; for Sailhamer's thesis that &quot;ha-eretz&quot; is Israel, however the text refers to Israel and *surrounding* countries.<br />Personally I think it more likely that &quot;ha eretz&quot; in the mind of the author of Genesis is the fertile crescent, while the desert was (as it is) &quot;void and without form&quot; (tohu wa bohu). In bronze age Palestine, *this* probably *was* the &quot;earth.&quot; As knowledge of Geography, interpreters kept making the text more &quot;universalistic.&quot; (You see a similar development in Greek Mythology--in the Fifth century B.C. the &quot;ends of the earth&quot; was Sicily, in the First Century is was Spain.)<br />Nonetheless the book holds many interesting theological insights, especially with regard to the parallels with the tabernacle and it is a substantial contribution.

Harris wrote a stirring defense of the historicity of the bodily resurrection of Jesus in his book EASTER IN DURHAM. For his trouble he was savage by this know-nothing in this book for not teaching a *physical* resurrection. Harris replied with FROM GRAVE TO GLORY, an exhaustive study of the doctrine of the resurrection which remains a standard of evangelical scholarship. Along the way he answered Geisler's repeated misrepresentations and falsehoods and showed his laughable ignorance of Greek. Not to be detered, Geisler mobilized his fellow Torquemadas (self-appointed \\"cult watchers\\") to secure a statement of condemnation from the Evangelical Free Church and badgered Harris into retirement.<br />Nice Work guys! Geisler is the worst representative of a resurgent Protestant scholasticism, he pretends to be a apologist (a \\"defender\\") but he's really a polemicist (a \\"war-monger\\") and a publicity hungry little parasite, seeking to build up his notoriety on the careers and reputations he attacks.

This book *deserves* five stars. It *is* the best case made for the &quot;no remarriage&quot; position among Protestants and quite possibly the best case that will and can ever be made for it and anyone serious about studying this matter, must familiarise themselves with it. However, it is not the last word on the matter.<br /> For anyone seeking the Lord's will on the matter, they would do well to *also* read Craig Keener's ...AND MARRIES ANOTHER and *especially* Dr. David Instone-Brewer's writings on Divorce and Remarriage available in online form at [...]<br /> For all its considerable strengths JESUS AND DIVORCE suffers from several &quot;sins of omission.&quot; <br /> 1. For all its attention to the Church fathers, it neglects to mention that Origen and Augustine, while also arguing against &quot;remarriage&quot; wondered aloud about how serious a sin it should be considered.<br /> 2.  The book neglects the Eastern Orthodox canon law which allows for remarriage &quot;as a concession&quot; on the basis of St. Paul in 1 Corinthians and so leaves the incorrect impression that there was no difference of opinion in the church until Erasmus.<br /> 3. Similarly, it neglects the early Anabaptists many of whom allowed for remarriage in the case of being &quot;unequally yoked&quot; with non-Anabaptists as well as in the case of adultery. Whatever the merits of their arguments they probably did not derive from Erasmus.     4. The allowance for divorce (and remarriage) independent of Deut. 24 on the basis of being denied &quot;food, clothing, and love&quot; (Exodus 21:10,11). (It is on *this* basis that God quite literally divorces Israel in Jeremiah 3!)<br /> Finally, for all their uncompromising tone Heth and Wenham &quot;wimp out&quot; toward the end. In the interests of consistency they should insist on the &quot;breaking up&quot; of &quot;adulterous marriages&quot; before being recieved into the church. As it is they settle for denying leadership positions and basically consigning the remarried to &quot;second-class citizenship&quot; where they can have their guilt lorded over them for the rest of their lives.<br /> This is hardly surprising, only Conservative Mennonites and other &quot;plain Anabaptists&quot; (Hutterites, Amish) seem to have the courage other their consistency in this matter.<br /> Therefore let it be the first (or second) book you read, but don't let it be your last!	2001-02-10

He won the Pulitzer prize for  editing the diaries of Mary Chestnut, but he probably deserved it for this,  his first work. Woodward was a master prose stylist, but I don't quite  think he ever quite matched this book in wit and irony. The first half of  the book is replete with CHARACTERS worthy of Anthony Trollope, John Brown  Gordon, the &quot;plumed knight of Appomattox&quot; and main player in one  of the great stock market scandals of the day; Joe Brown, the former  confederate governor of Georgia also known as &quot;Old Judge-MENT&quot;;  Alexander H. Stephens, the former vice-president of the Confederacy and a  force to be reckoned with even in declining health; and last but not least  Robert Toombs, a TRUE unreconstructed rebel, who refused to take the oath  of allegiance to the Union after the war, who hated the railroads (and the  use of public funds in their development) almost as much as he hated the  North. Even though he was unable to hold public office, he maintained  influence just by his force of personality.  Above them all is Watson, a  man who loves (and hates) not wisely but too well. A man of infinite  paradoxes. An apologist for the &quot;old south&quot; who proclaimed the  common interests between black farmers and white farmers. A white man who,  more than once, would defend black political allies from lynching, but  later would be the most vociferious defender of the practice. A crusader  against corporations, he would grow fearful of socialism. A democrat with  authoritarian personality. A man of the people who was one of the largest  landowners (and landlords) in Georgia. A powerful &quot;demagogue&quot; (in  the root sense of the word) who was a remarkably BAD politician and  political strategist, eventually turning on every constituency and ally.  Incorruptable, but in the end wholly given over to his (and his region's)  prejudices, hatreds, and pathology.<br />This is a definitive biography, but  not the last word on Watson--certainly not the last word on populism. As  much as we see of Watson's psyche, this book is very much an account of a  public life, the personal dimension and familial relationships are only  touched on, sometimes only hinted at. If every there was a subject fit for  a &quot;psychobiography&quot; it is Watson.<br />As to the movement he lead,  the somewhat idealized portrait needs to be balance with reference to THE  WOOL-HAT BOYS and BLACKS AND THE POPULIST REVOLT. But when all is said,  this book is a classic. Worthy of sharing shelfspace with Boswell's LIFE OF  JOHNSON and even Trollope's politcal novels  and Gore Vidal's historical  novels.	2000-07-18

To Hicks, they were the forerunners of the New Deal. To Woodward, they possessed a fleeting  opportunity at biracial  coalition. To Hofstatder, they were proto-fascists. To Larry Goodwyn, they  possessed a vision of a just society. To Michael Schwarz, they were  radicals whose strength lay in direct action, not electioneering.  The last  word on the movement is far from being written and this book can only keep  the reader current on the history and present state of research and  interpretation. This it does wonderfully well, as well as presents a clear  account of the emergence, rise and decline of the movement which  synthesizes and recapitulates virtually all available histories on  different aspects of the movement.  I have to dissent from the reviewer  below and say that I found McMath a clear and brisk writer--not in C. Vann  Woodward's league, perhaps, but then...who is?--who brings the movement  alive and elucidates its dynamic masterfully. <br />If you have the least bit  of curiosity about the movement, this is the first book you should read.  The one significant criticism I have is that the author cuts off the  narrative at 1898. In this manner, he avoids many--but by no means all--of  th e more troublesome aspects of the movement and its participants. It  would also seem that an additional chapter on populism's legacy through the  twentieth century would be in order, encompassing as it does such diverse  figures as Wright Patman, Huey Long, and George Wallace.<br />Finally, to all  who are interested in the issues surrounding the new global economy:  Read  this book! Study the Populists! You will gain much insight into the process  of &quot;development&quot; since WWII and the struggles of people  throughout the &quot;less-developed world&quot; for their livelihood.  <br />Indeed, I fancy that the ghosts of Tom Watson and Mary Lease were with  those in Seattle marching against the WTO last year and in Washington  against the World Bank and the IMF this year!	2000-07-11
