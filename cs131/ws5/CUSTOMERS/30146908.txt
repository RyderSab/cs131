US	30146908	RUFLQ3R1NYCG0	0452010853	252490098	The Germans	Books	4	8	12	N	N	PRETTY GOOD, BUT HOPELESSLY OUT OF DATE	There are some interesting points made, emphasized by Craig as <br />I have not seen before, with interpretations which are interesting to say the least, such as the rejection by several Cathbolic churchmen in Germany and the excommunication of at least one bishop for rejection of the 1870 decree by convention of the doctrine of Papal Infallability.  Craig finds in this rejection more than doubt based upon absence of Biblical or Logical support, but an attempt by a Foreign Power (Papacy) to dominate Germany on the eve of Unification via the War of 1871-72.  With no discussion of the reaction to the doctrine elsewhere, it is unclear if Germans took the matter seriously while other countries with substantial Catholic populations simply accepted the decree or thought it too silly to think about. <br /> <br />The discussion of the Thirty Years War in Germany and the concerted policy by major European countries that Germany  remain a collection of minor states to avoid German domination of the Continent are worth reading.  The causes, life in and during and effects of WW I are hardly touched upon. <br />The enormous damage done to Europe by US foreign policy under Wilson is not mentioned, nor is the generalized fiction about Germany in the US and UK during this period.  A hint at the origins of modern Anti-Semitism is provided by a discussion of a handfull of Jewish swindlers leading to the Panic (Depression) of 1873. The role of war reperations from France due to the 72-73 victory by Prussia/Germany is discussed.  A point worth thinking about, but whose validity is not backed-up. There is not a word concerning how rhe Depression of 1873 contributed to the cultural environment into which Hiter was born about 20 years later. Perhaps such influence can be neither proved or inferred.  Considering how until the 1950s at least Southern children grew up hearing stories of Great-Grandpa's fight with the Yankees an hundred years before, the depression's effect on Hitler as a child must have existed.  Craig is a bit more realistic about Jews in Germany than most so-called historians who paint a picture of virgins amongst bandits.  There is no meaningful discussion of Germany's purposes after the Weimar Republic. There is no discussion of the analyses, especially Spengler's, of the struggle to preserve European (including American) civilization. The fiction that the UK and France attacked Germany in 1939 to answer aggression in Europe is not given the lie to. (Russia had attacked and annexed parts of Finland earlier during the 1930s.) There is hardly any discussion of the Hitler period.  As there are no worthwhile histories of the period in English, it is probably as well.  The horrors visited upon the Germans by Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill are hardly mentioned.  The hostility, even hatred that many present-day Germans have for at least elements of US troops on German soil is unmentioned.   <br /> <br />The one chapter in the book I found most disappointing is entitled \\"The Professors.\\" What I found most lacking is the origins of the German mindset, which Bertrand Russell claimed was shared by Jews who fled Hitler, and he characterized as abstract and complex instead of the British mindset which Russell thought more immediate, practical and simple.  The German invention of history as science in the 19th century is hinted upon.  The subject's regression into nonsense, propaganda and moralisms goes unlamented. <br /> <br />\\"The Germans\\" is a fun book to read.  It presents few challanges aside from a few untranslated quotations.  It sheds a bit of light.	2005-10-13

Scott Fitzgerald or Hemmingway for example) would detract from the power of the events and add a surface covering of soapoperaness or the point of view of condemnation or justification that makes Malmud's \\"The Fixer\\" less than the work it could have been in the hands of a genius.  Capote shows a kind of genius, or at a minimum very keen judgement in his writing.  The movie made from the story was good.   It lacks the sense of brilliant detachment that makes this book special.  The closest modern author in English I know of is Joseph Conrad.  I recommend Capote's book.	2005-09-26

It is a bit like Newton's Principia, important though few living now have read the original (in Latin).  In somewhat the same way that Colridge's interpretation of Hamlet has become the more-or-less standard concept of the character and play, Maimonides' interpretation of Torah has become pretty standard, though more modern commentaries present quite different interpretations.  MT's view is extremely ethnocentric.  To people who have studied both Torah itself and MT, it may seem (as to me) that MT is the more ethnocentric, though MT's view is justified by the fundamental presumption of Maimonidese:  That Jacob is the model for behavior whom ought be copied and emulated.  Some more modern commentaries have rejected this fundamental assumption, and, as religions are fundamental assumptions,  may be viewed as contr-Judaic at least in the traditional form.  MT does more than make comments upon the Torah, of course.  There are rules of numerous kinds, as a Jew ought not live in a town that does not have a good physician, a Jew may go to a Gentile physician only at the point of death and a Jew must accept death rather than be treated by an apostate physician.  These rules may be prejudiced a bit by Maimonides' being a physician; however, the last rule, about the apostate physician, is quite consistent with the general view that the focus of God is upon the population over time of the Chosen People, and not upon the individual. Rabbinnic rulings reflect this view to this day, as the one recently in Israel that a disruptive student should be dismissed rather than slow or prevent the remainder of the class from learning.  Torah has many examples of this viewpoint, as the centuries lost in slavery after Joseph before Moses when individuals are neglected by God, though the People is not.  MT <br />presents a very heavy burden in terms of effort to follow, as the prohabition against gambling (of which modern Judaism is substantially unaware) whis is, if with a Gentile, a waste of time and with a Jew stealing if you win and MT say:  It is not proper that a person should do anything which neither increases his understanding nor contributes to the progress of civilization. MT is pretty much devoid of Maimonides' person viewpoints, which are at the juncture where science begins, though Maimonides does not quite take the step. His views include that a Jew should accept truth regardless of source and his essentially naturalistic bases explaining such things as death.  If one wishes a fuller discussion of the development of Judaism, Herman Cohen's book, \\"Religion of Reason; Out of the Origins of Judaism\\" is a good choice.  Spinoza appears to be influenced by MT as well as obviously influenced by Torah.	2005-09-26

There is a quality of Kafka more than Tolstoy.  The power is so distant.  But then Solzhenitsyn takes himself and us into the mind of Stalin himself.  This is the weakest part of the book.  He makes sounds which he imagines to be Stalin's, as having Stalin think of going to Church- like Christians everywhere.  One never feels inside Stalin. It seems almost a childlike view of the dictator. In many ways it is as one-sided, though not as propagandistic or overtly phony  as the many \\"studies\\" of Hitler.  \\"Ten years!  That's no sentence.  Thirty years.\\"<br /><br />One can see the horror of arbitrary power, but not look into the soul of its possessor.  There is an immense suffering implied by the men driven away on the meat truck-  the one who says they are leaving Hell and the other who says No! We are going there now.  There is more reality in the suffering of a man who cares only for family.  It is tempting to compare this book with \\"Les Miserables\\" by Victor Hugo.  I think Hugo's picture of victimhood is less realistic, more Romantic than Solzhenitsyn's.  \\"The First Circle\\" is a book that ought to be read- that much I can honestly say--though I feel Solzhenitsyn bit off more than he could chew.  It would have taken a Shakespeare to have told the story as powerfully, yet with more realism.	2005-09-20

It was great fun then, and I still enjoy reading things like how Watson discovers Holmes is unaware that the earth goes about the sun.  Holmes says the knowledge is useless to him, and he will endevor to forget it, and he likens the mind to an attic wherein, upon reaching some fullness, something must be removed if something else is to be added.  And the relative values of the items must be evaluated.  The collection would be a nice gift instead of another video game or DVD.	2005-09-20

Of course she had died of cancer when Watson and Crick et. al. received the Nobel Prize; otherwise she would have been included, as she deserved.  That aside, the principal value of young people's reading this book, aside from a passing familiarity with a key discovery of modern times, is the way Watson and Crick interacted to get to the truth.  Each would attack the arguments of the other- not in the tricky sort of way one associates with TV lawyers, but pointing out the limits of the other's arguments and contradictions with established principles of chemistry and physics.  It is somewhat akin to Talmudic argument.   It has a good deal owed to the logic of Aristotle and the thought process <br />of thesis, antithesis, synthesis repeated over and over developed by Hegal. The book provides enough insight to be of value without such technical detail that would take it out of the range of an average reader.	2005-09-12

I still have a copy.  I used to have two copies, but my brother-in-law who edits textbooks asked for it.  I had no idea there was a 10th edition.    I recall something that happened perhaps eight years ago.  Concerning my job, some people and I were talking about heat, and a fellow not party to the conversation asked me <br />if I knew what absolute zero was.  Well, it turned out that this fellow was a physics professor--I'd probably not answered him if I'd known that, but I recalled the Sears and Zemansky  <br />definition from the 2nd edition involving a chain of Carnot engines receiving heat one from the prior until such an engine <br />is reached that it rejects no heat.  He said I was wrong, and he gave me the ideal gas version, contending that as no true Carnot engin exists, the answer I gave had no validity.  I later sent him a Xerox of the relevant pages of the book.  The interesting thing is that he took the ideal gas view to be true, but the Carnot engine version to be untrue because no true Carnot engine exists, but did not find it strange that the ideal gas version involves an \\"ideal\\" gas.  Odd.  To be truthful, I hope today's texts are clearer.  Mine has few illustrations and very little explaining.  One reason current students may have difficulty with the 10th edition of Sears and Zemansky or any other physics text could be a lack of understanding of trig.  Educators ought to teach in high school or earlier how dependent understanding physics is upon understanding trig.  A good trig course is a better foundation for university level physics than high school physics.	2005-09-09

I am not totally certain that I understand Spinoza's \\"Ethics\\"  <br />as well as I should, because I fail to see the peace of mind other reviewers say it engenders.   <br /> <br />One reviewer from Israel said that Spinoza is contrary to Jewish tradition.  I think that she is right in that the ethical foundation upon which Judaism rests is shattered, but otherwise Spinoza is a natural extention of Judaism.  Spinoza had a foundation of prior Jewish thinkers much as Einstein and Newton had foundations upon which they built.  Ben Maimon follows tradition in MT (in Hebrew), but in GFTP (in Arabic) his expressions are much more naturalistic, as death existing for the individual so that species would survive with no reference to a creator or sin.  In a greater withdrawl than Ben Maimom from the personal or national God, Spinoza retains the generalized, assumed but unspoken god apart from the Torah with the definition as the balance, simple machine, logical if-and-then <br />principle, basis for economic thought and implication that god is \\"just\\".  He retains, without personality, the Hebrew God, but explores the implications of a generalized ethic in place of the Hebrew biblical ethic that whatever is in the long term interests of the Jewish people is \\"good\\" and whatever is contrary to this is to be struggled against if performed by others and condemmed as \\"sin\\" if performed by a Jew.  But Spinoza retains the heart, though not the ethnocentrisity, of Old Testament ethics.  He generalizes the principle as \\"risk\\".  Risk is a natural element of all life.  The expression of the nature of god as related to man is risk.  Risk is the essence of responsibility:  where there is no risk there is no responsibility.  This means that power is the basis of human ethical relationships, and the exercise of power is, in the world of Spinoza's ethics, guided and restricted by risk.   <br /> <br />Herman Cohen (died c 1900), in his great work \\"Religion of Reason:  Out of the Origins of Judaism\\" gives his opinion that to be a true religion a system must be true, not simply believed.  Spinoza's ethical philosophy takes the assumed but unstated god of the Old Testament as true, not in the mystical sense, but the literal or even scientific sense, while rejecting God as invention.  In essence, take God out of Judaism and replace him with god and you have Spinoza's ethics. Take Spinoza's ethics and put in the collective judgement that whatever is in the long term interests of the Jewish people is to be promoted thorough other peoples and considered right or good if done by the individual Jew, and you have returned to God, even if you are not religious.	2005-09-02

He uses his notion of people's needing to turn away from their own natures and not look too closely at themselves, as causal to anti-semitism.  He is probably correct that mankind in general wishes to concentrate the mind upon some external idea.  Religion does this, of course, giving people a beautiful or demanding abstraction to focus upon at the expense of one's own nature.  This is no brilliant insight.  It is an idea as old as Genesis.  Sartre's creation of a relationship between this  <br />aspect of man's existence and anti-semitism is that the anti-semite concentrates feeling, thought and force of will upon the Jew individually or collectively in order to keep his own mind from  <br />concentrating on his true nature.   <br /> <br />As an explanation of anti-semitism Sartre is spouting pure nonsense.  He says, for instance, that one cannot understand  <br />anti-semitism unless one knows that Jews are totally blameness. <br /> <br />Sartre's general philosophy is of interest to many people, but is of no particular importance to me.  However, his theory of the cause of anti-semitism is of importance when people accept what he is saying.  His stated view is much akin to notions that anti-semitism is some sort of \\"virus\\" that infects the sufferer or that anti-semitism is \\"the most virulent form of raceism\\" or similar notions which have Jews in the position of young children being attacked, perhaps killed, by a child molester turned child killer.  This view, widely promoted, is an attempt to force the public's minds to ignore cause-and-effect.  Sartre's argument is infantile; it has no more connection to real causes of anti-semitism than a comic book or a video game has to real life.	2005-08-18

Perhaps he assumes readers are already Jefferson scholars and he needs only sort of remind them.   Anyway, the book seems very superficial.  Perhaps that is because little is known of Jefferson's life aside from official papers and his letters to John Adams.  His \\"Notes on the State of Virginia\\" is more telling about his true feelings and fears.  Modern media have distorted the expression 'all men are created equal' to mean something very much at odds with what Jefferson intended.  It is obvious from \\"Notes\\" that he recognizes differencies in abilities and that he has a value system that is essentially aesthetic as opposed to abstract, much more Greek than Hebrew.  He perceived that Christianity could be claimed either by the Greek (aesthetically based) ethics or the Hebrew (power based) <br />ethics, and he wished to draw it to the aesthetic.  This is all quite obvious in Jefferson's own words, as it is not in Ellis'. <br />In Jefferson's view race came down to aesthetics regarding man's future.  It is evident that this is what he means when in \\"Notes\\" he famously says 'I fear for my country when I remember that God is just.'  He perceives that the power based ethic is the Law of Nature.  He fears this greatly.  Ellis does not seem to grasp this fundamental fact. <br />	2005-05-16

I doubt that the work could be published as is today were it new, even if by such a well-known author.  Those were the days of free, or at least freeer press.  <br /> <br />Because the time span is so great, more attention is paid to 19th Century history up to the end of WW I, where it stops than to older periods.  But earlier periods are treated in ways according to the information available to the non-specialist.  Wells' history is easier to read than that of the Durants and lacks their obvious bias. With the exception of Spengler, Wells' History is perhaps the last history or biography in which the European point of view is taken as matter-of-fact.	2005-01-31

When Newton wrote his Principia, only a handful of people could understand it.  It had math and it was written in Latin.  But Darwin's method is the same as Newton's:  both developed a theory which \\"explained\\" observation.  Neither gave nor claimed to give the final word.  Neither is a discussion of ethics, politics, religion. business, etc.  It was known to everyone that variation in life existed with some sets of living organisms being more akin to one another than to other sets.  Some sub-sets within a given set of organisms were able to interbreed with one another, but not with other members of the set.  Darwin attempted to explain how this happened.  Science is never \\"true\\" in the sense that <br />religion is \\"true\\".  Science does not depend upon the authority of individues.   <br />The idea that the Pope may pronounce something true and it becomes \\"true\\" is a different definition of the word \\"true\\" than Darwin or Newton or any other scientist saying someing is true--on the one hand the \\"truth\\" exists because of who made the statement, but on the (scientific) hand, the one making the statement is not relevant.   <br /> <br />Some reviewers have stated that \\"Origin of Species\\" is hard to read.  I suppose that is true compared to a novel, but compared to most scientific literature it is a piece of cake.  It is about as hard to read as \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" by Adam Smith.   <br /> <br />Darwin's work, like all science, is based upon the concept that nature is consistent over time.  To throw out Origin of Species <br />based upon the idea that God creates inconsistencies now and again to effect this purpose or that mekes no more sense than throwing out Newton, Einstein etc and physics and chemistry as well as biology.  No amount of evidence to the contrary convinces those who insist upon God's intervention because it cannot be absolutely disproved.  Such views are OK, but they are not science and must not be introduced into science classes. <br /> <br />	2005-01-26

It is a practical guide not only to the methodology, but to psychology of actual armed combat.  \\"On War\\" has, for instance, the only meaningful justification for strictly following chain of command: If soldiers are in danger, they will follow their own desire for safety, all else being equal, but the mission and the greater situation are presumed to be known by higher headquarters, therefore the soldiers' following chain of command is essential.  The distortions of this basic purpose of chain of command within organizations, especially governmental organization, even in peacetime, is legendary.  \\"On War\\" addresses the necessity of commanders' judging the relative  values of different units and how they match up against the enemy.  It may not be the best thing for a commander to throw his best troops (in training, equipment, etc) against the enemy's best troops.  If the need is to check the enemy, as to delay him or force him to take a less advangageous way or to walk rather than ride, and that mission can be done by lesser troops, those lesser troops should be employed (even if it means more dead and wounded) and the better troops held back to deliver more decisive blows.   <br /> <br />\\"On War\\" is a quite cynical look at armed war.  It is said that the ancient Spartans did not ask how many the enemy were, only where they were.  Such gut-level thinking is the antithesis of von Clausewitz's teachings.	2004-09-10

There  are currently attempts to paint him as a sexual pervert or having Parkenson's disease.  He was not a madman.  His ideas were part of the currency of the time.  In his \\"History of The World\\" H.G. Wells discusses the atttempt to bring the world under a \\"firm Jewish heel\\".  It is interesting that Wells takes this as an obvious fact, not out-of-the-blue speculation.  Hitler came to the same conclusion.  His initial hatred for Jews  was not theoretical, but based on his observations or taking as fact that Jews ran brothels in Vienna where the sexual favors of German girls were sold to all interested.  His reaction apppears similar to what a traditionalist White Southerner might think on seeing Howard Stern on TV today.  It is unclear if Hitler was aware of Oswald Spengler's view that the German loss of WW I was the first great step in the downfall of Western Civilization to the \\"colored world\\" (Spengler's words)  and that the \\"next war\\" would determine if Western Civilization survied or died.  Hitler's views are far from insane; they in many ways seem the product of a logic machine.  \\"X\\" is happening; \\"Y\\" is promoting \\"X\\"; \\"X\\" is not desired, therefore  eliminate \\"Y\\".  Exactly the same logic exists today, but \\"X\\" is the destruction of European man and \\"Y\\" is the forces   creating \\"X\\" and \\"X\\" is desired, therefore \\"Y\\" is promoted.      It is evident that Hitler's hatred for Jews was not based upon any sort of theology, but upon their more-or-less generally perceived negative impact upon the Western World in general and upon Germany in particular. If the Jews had been any other peoples having the same perceived impact, Hitler would have felt the same about them.  This is evident by his dislike for France, based upon his perception, stated in Mein Kampf, that that country would be a Negro state in several hundred years and that France had put Negros on the Rhine. Perhaps the greatest difference between Hitlerand conventional politicians is that Hitler though more of the future than the immediate, as he said in the context of the 1938 pact with Stalin.  Hitler appears to have had a fair knowledge of Judaism.  He once said that Judaism is not a religion, but a philosophy.  Einstein said almost the same thing.  Interestingly, Herman Cohen said that to be a religion a system had to be true, in the scientific sense, not \\"I know\\" when \\"I believe strongly\\" is meant,  As any casual student of TANACH and Talmud knows, Jewish ethics are based upon the notion that whatever is in the long term interest of the Jewish people, as centuries go by, is a positive good and sin is anything which acts against this end.  The reversal of values in America is an astounding exhibit of the power of tightly controlled propaganda.  As a whole the European population of the US has become convinced that caring about the future is a positive evil and not caring is a positive good.  Judge Learned Hand (the 12th member of the Supreme Court) wrote many years ago that control over the great newspapers and magazines constitutes the real government of the United States.  Today TV and motion pictures would be in first place as influence.  The anti-European programming on TV has become standard.  An interesting directly political case showing this control is the now dead \\"Fairness Doctrin\\" of the FCC about 30 years ago.  The doctrin was that TV stations having ads for political candidates had to accept ads of all political candidates.  The controllers of TV at the time went to the federal courts, where the Supreme Court ruled the doctrin constitutional.  So the controllers had the heart of the doctrin cut out by the FCC itself.  The objection was, of course, that it partially created a free press in the US.  Now the term \\"right wing\\" means harmless radio and TV opinion programs where serious discussion is never found.  The European population of the US (and of much of Western Europe) has with exceptions ofcourse been induced to give up their self-respect. The US government has been influenced by this same mentality of low self-respect.  It should be obvious that a people who lack self-respect will find themselves attacked externally.  Judaism to some degree defines itself in terms of enemies.  This seems obvious- to be Chosen necessitates that the \\"other\\" is non-chosen and inferior, \\"the evil ones\\" as RAMBAM calls them.   The introduction of Kantian ethics into modern commentaries on TANACH appears to be a conscious attempt to reduce the notion that the non-chosen are valueless to God.  This is a moving away from Rabbi Akiba's argument that God cared only for Jews, because Jews are circumcised, which is to God as a uniform is to the king, and as the king loves his own soldiers and recognizes them by their uniforms, so God knows and loves his chosen and not the non-chosen.      When you read Mein Kampf remember that it is a political argument trying to attract and maintain support, not a scientific analysis.  We are today fully familiar with half truths and statements quoted out of context and similar devices   used by American political figures to attract support for themselves or this or that program.  Hitler did much the same thing.  In one almost universal practice of national governments  Hitler's book is a bit stupid; it is a stupidity widely shared.  In addition to being a statement of his views, Mein Kampf is also a policy statement, though it was written long before he had governmental authority.  National governments have a great bias for establishing and then following policy without due re-examination.  Hitler did just that.  He established policy and he followed it somewhat blindly with little regard to the flux of circumstance.  In many ways it may be said that he had little understanding of the impacts policy, once established, carried out would have upon Germany.  He was making policy beyond his understanding; a common fault at the national governmentlevel, where policy makers seldom really understand the varient effects of policy carried out.  He put what he perceived as the national good above the welfare or even survival of the individual.  That is a common mindset of political and other leaders.  Maimonides in M-Torah says that   a person should let himself die rather than be treated by an apostate physician, clearly a bias for the long-term good of the people over the survival of the individual.  It seems pretty clear that Hitler judged the accomplishment of his aims  to be limited by personal leadership with institutionalized continuation rather than by a rule-following institution, thus he saw the realization of the principal aims as having to be accomplished by him individually.  This limitation was his great weakness.      As far as reading is concerned, Mein Kampf is of interest only because it is by Hitler.  Obviously, a student of the period should read it.      There was an overwhelming change in World history produced by the destruction of Germany by the US, UK and Russia that is far greater than any historical event in thousands of years.  It does not mean a change of colors on a map; it means fundamental, permanent change in the nature of man at the biological level.  Most past European wars had meant little more than which prince peasants would pay taxes to or perhaps whether they would have some sort of representation at most.  Hitler's book should be read with the understanding of what he saw at stake: The fundamental nature of European man for all time.  He was willing to do anything to protect it.     It is of some interest that Hitler does not mean by the word \\"race\\" the classifications used by physical anthropologists such as Carlton Coon, who put man into five biologic divisions, with mixed persons not fitting into any of the five. (Caucazoid, Mongoloid, Congoid, Capoid and Australioid)  Hitler uses the term to mean any of very many groups, thus he says that the only surviving pure race will be the \\"Jewish race\\".  The translation given a German newspaper of the Hitler period is \\"Racial Observer\\".  The German is \\"Volklisher Beobacer\\" which does not mean racial observer, but something more akin to \\"Popular Observer\\" or more loosly \\"National Observer\\".	2004-09-08

I think many people simply interested in Human Nature will find \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" a key work.

Stampp intends to and does limit his discussion to the impact of Black slavery upon Blacks in an  Anglo-Saxon world.  He does not venture much into arguments that slavery or serfdom existed until the 19th century in Eastern Europe as well as in Africa itself and some of the Arab world.  Nor does Stampp tell anything of the great harm done the greater society.  He does go into the economics of slavery a bit- enough to see the future.  It is quite evident that slavery was on the way out and the Civil War pushed up the date perhaps 10 or 20 years.  He does not go much into the moral ambiguity among the White civilization.  Thomas Jefferson believed the presence of the Blacks in North America was a mortal danger.     Perhaps Stampp has done the best thing in leaving unsaid the   tragedy visited upon Western civilization in favor of the tragedy visited upon the slaves, with some small discussion of the \\"why\\" of Black presence and the \\"why\\" of Black slavery.  His attention placed as it is lends greater purity to the history.  The weakness of the book is any attention to happiness which slaves, perhaps a minority of slaves, enjoyed.  This absence tends the book toward a work of propaganda rather than an history.  Stampp's book is worth reading.  It should not be taken as the whole story, not by a long shot!	2004-08-17

VALUABLE IDEAS	While it is true that comparisons of the American and English, especially the American, with the Russian and French Revolutions are very imperfect, theories proposed by Britton in<br /><br /> examining these revolutions are interesting. One of the most valuable ideas of his is that revolutions tend not to occur when things are really horrid, but when they are getting better. This concept proposes a tool for examining socities and predicting the future. This is consistent with the urban riots of the late 1960s with the rights gained by Blacks as opposed to the absence of such riots under Jim Crow. This could be expected using Britton's analytical tool. Another valuable concept is the return of the old order, perhaps in a different form, following the revolution, therefore Stalin follows the Czars and the First Empire after the killing of the king. Britton offers King George and the re-establishment of central authority by the Constitution, court rulings and such as an American comparison. This is really stretching a valuable idea. The British king before the revolution was certainly not a tyrant in North America. In fact the Royal Governor in Virginia was so popular that his statue still stands in front of the Wren building at William and Mary, as it did before the revolution. To compare the power of the Georges in America to that of the Czars is stretching a point. But to compare George Washington, John Adams and John Marshal to Stalin is absurd. Britton's real point is that centralization followed centralization. As Patrick Henry said of the Constittution &quot;I smell a rat.&quot; Of course the centralization of power in Washington today is vastly greater than it ever was before 1776. The analytical tools Britton proposes are useful in predicting what will happen in particular situations , but they cannot be applied in the manner of<br /><br /> mathamatical formulars predicting physical, chemical or even biologic events.	2004-07-30
US	30146908	RU7L0BHIFGTGX	055321392X	882109329	Of Human Bondage (Bantam Classics)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	The Real main character	Mildred is the real main character of the novel.  She is a woman who cannot stand any weakness in a man.  To her weakness is repulsive.  Mildred's is a way of female feeling that is very real and can be very dangerous for the woman herself and those who care about her.  Mildred is unable to appreciate the fact that not really caring is the single quality of mind that most makes a person, male or female, appear strong.  Mildred runs to men who do not care about her.  And it destroys her life.  Mildred is an expression of a very real kind of woman:  a hatred for weakness, a love of excitement and fun, needing to float above meaning in words she utters or hears, repulsed by meaning, able to endure only words which are hollow. It is said that a sense of purpose is for most people a great need.  Mildred wants with all her longing never to need a reason for being. (This is perhaps the most intoxicating of all human longings.)  Mildred wants to keep it that way:  not needing any purpose. She wants talk to be bar talk-- words which are spoken but are not reflected upon, which hide her from the real and permit her to float above deep emotions as above everyday mundane issues.  Such a woman can be very exciting to a man, but exceedingly dangerous to love.  The Mildreds of the world long to be dominated, but to fight the domination.  To deeply love such a woman is very possible; to dominate her is very possible, but both to love and dominate her is exceedingly difficult.  This is a Human Bondage.    I have read several reviews of this novel.  I am surprised that no-one mentioned money.  Money and the need to get it are constant notions in W.S.M's novels; as he says in this novel, \\"Money is like a sixth sense, and you cannot use the other five without it.\\"  This is one aspect, the most general and important, of human bondage; W.S.M has a constant obsession with this as being the barrier which separates the physical, locked-in world from the spiritual (meaning relationships among people and to beauty and emotions, not the relationship to God) life of unfettered action and motions.  \\"Enough money to be generous with my friends\\".	2004-07-19

Various people who are not principal to the story  are telling what they saw to a man new to the area.  So the amount available for telling is much less than were the story told from the all-knowing point of view of most novels or the first person point of view.  It is astonishing how well the author uses this limited point of view to relate the passions and fears of the principal characters.  Anyone who has not read Wuthering Heights as an assignment in high school or college should read it for the enjoyment.  It well deserves its reputation as a classic of English literature.  The book has been made into movies a number of times, so many people who have never read the book are familiar with the story,  or at least to the end of the first generation.  Even if you know the story, you will enjoy the beauty of the book as literature.  The book is also a powerful statement against the limitations in legal rights of women at the time. It is this powerlessness which produces the tragedy in the second generation.  So the book can be read as a women's lib argument; I have no idea if the author intended to make such an argument; it's not being in any way a polemic makes the point in a very matter of fact way, but the reader is aware nonetheless.<br />Read Wuthering Heights if you can; you will not regret it.	2004-01-30
US	30146908	R1TO51M7AFUQW7	0521657296	301591247	Critique of Pure Reason (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant)	Books	4	7	11	N	N	A Basis For Thought	Kant begins with the simple statement that all knowledge is based upon experience.  It is the last easily understood sentence in the book.  Philosophy had established two types of knowledge:  analytical and synthetic.  A valid analytical statement is always absolutely true, thus is \\"known\\".  The statement \\"The sum of two right angles in the Euclidian system  is equal to a straight line\\" is an analytical statement.  It is \\"true\\" in that the statement is derived from Euclidian propositions and agrees with the propositions from which it is derived.  It says nothing about the actual nature of the world.  The statement \\"The cat is on the table\\" is a synthetic statement.  The word synthetic used means a synthesis of known and knower.  The synthetic statement is open to dispute.  It may be the product of deception, imagination or any number of other factors which make it beyond absolute knowledge.  Kant's book is an attempt to establish that there is or is not  some connection in some manner in which any  synthetic knowledge can be known with the certainty that an analytical statement can be \\"known\\".  Synthetic statements include all scientific knowledge, such as the second law of thermodynamics.  The second law necessitates existencce of physical material which obeys it. In order to be \\"knowable\\" the knowledge must be a priori as a necessary condition. The closest that Kant comes to establishing this connection is via the type of knowledge called synthetic a priori, which is to say a joining of the known and knower without experience of the known by the knower.  The closest he comes to establishing that this type of knowledge is real is the knowledge of TIME, which he asserts is not itself experienced but whose reality can be asserted via the experience of events which have sequence. A.N. Whitehead uses the example of space as synthetic a priori, in that space known within a given distance can be known a prior that it extends far beyond possible experience.  A priori is necessary for certainty, but not sufficient.  Neither TIME nor SPACE  establishes that anything synthetic can be known with the total certainty that an analytical statement can be \\"known\\".  As he puts it, \\"Existence is not a true predicate.\\"  It should be obvious that Kant considers any knowledge which is not absolutely certain to be something less than knowledge.  It is interesting that the later German philosopher Schopenhauer would consider no-one a man who had not read and understood the \\"Critique of Pure Reason\\".  It was on my high school reading list, and I tried to read it then,  but interested people who are not advanced students of logic and philosophy would doubtless be better off reading an abridged version.<br /><br />\\"The Critique\\" is a continuation of the tradition of attempts to prove the existence of God, which was seen by some as being \\"necessary\\" and therefore true in a sense that the existence of the natural world is not \\"necessary\\".  That view was followed up by Descartes' famous assertion \\"I think, therefore I am.\\"  Kant rejected both these views with his famous assertion \\"Existance is not a true predicate.\\"  Later, the British philosopher Bertrand Russell modified Descartes' statement to \\"There is thought, therefore there is existance.\\"<br />  Russell lived after Kant, so Kant's reaction is unknown.  Kant uses logic to come to oppposite conclusions, contradictions.  In \\"A Brief History of Time\\" Steven Hawking shows that some of these contrary statements are in fact identical statements because Kant was using the classical view that time is constant, while the contradictions can be explained by Einstein's thory that time is actually a dependent function, passing at different rates from different viewpoints depending upon velocity.  Perhaps some of the theory of relativity could have been extrapolated from the \\"Critique of Pure Reason\\", but Kant did not make the connection. Perhaps it influenced some scientists around the turn of the 20th centurybefore the Michaelson-Morley experiment or even before Maxwell.  Who knows.  Today Kant's influence is principally through his ethical thought, which shows up in some Jewish commentaries on the Bible as well as in the larger community.<br />His conclusions that synthetic propositions cannot be known with the certainty that analytical propositions can be \\"known\\" is simply taken as an everyday part of life today.ichaelson-Morley experiment or even before Maxwell.
