Boudicca has always been a favorite character of mine, so when I found out that a book had been written about her, I hurried to get my copy.  Big mistake!  What a disappointment.  I don't claim to be an expert on ancient Celtic culture, but I have read my share of books on the subject.  I know about the druids and their religion, and their ability to foretell the future, but this constant dreaming . . . What a drag! The story tells that Breaca was a warrior, not a dreamer.  Nevertheless, during the book, she had all the dreams that mattered.  She dreamt the storm when Caradoc was washed ashore, and about the destruction of the Roman boat following them.  She dreamt the death of the elder grandmother . . .   I must agree with two other reviewers who wrote that the characters are children and still they act as mature adults.  Ban is only 8 when the book starts, 11 when he plays against Amminios the game of Warriors and Dreamers, but I wonder, was he 11 or 30?  Spoilers to follow.  Read on at your own risk!  And so many contradictions!  At times, Breaca remembers that Caradoc was the only one of the Sun Hound's sons who didn't come to the Eceni lands upon the treacherous attack by the river, and then she remembers when he came: one, two, maybe three times?  Did he come or not?  Breaca loves him, has seen him often, but when he comes to Mona, she doesn't recognize him and even asks Gunovic who he is.  The way the color of his hair is portayed in the book leaves no room for doubt.  It's easy to know who he is.  And the scar in Breaca's palm!  It throbs all the time, and then at the end of the book, it says that the spear scar was throbbing for the first time.  Hello!  Bad memory or what?  And why did Ban never dream again after he left Britain?  Was he not supposed to be the greatest dreamer of all?  And when he arrives in the battlefield, how can he recognize Togodubnos and his lover Odras (whom he had only seen once) when they have been burning in the pyre for almost two days?  And most of all, regardless of how you put it, Ban is a traitor.  Turning against his own people because he believes Caradoc and Togodubnos conspired with Amminios?  And what happened to the chariots?  Ancient Celts fought in chariots and Boudicca foremost amoung them.  Disappointing!  One thing is certain.  I will not be reading the next installment in the trilogy.  This is it!	2005-04-05

Then came Joan Wolf, daring to write a book of Arthur about Arthur.  And not just the stupid, unimaginate character depicted by many writers, but  a man among men, not only with a dream, but with the brilliance to carry it through.  An Arthur who is more than Guenevere's lap dog.  Hurray for Ms. Wolf! <br />You find all the elements that make a book outstanding here: chivalry, adventure, battles, blood, love, friendship . . . and that beautiful love story between Arthur and Morgan. <br />This book is a must for every Arthurian lover.

The information on the Spanish monarchy, the Inquisition and even the French Court was rich in images, but when I pick up a book I want more.  Reading a book is like watching a movie.

Be it of a good man, victim of the circumstances, or of an evil being who wouldn't hesitate to murder his own flesh and blood to usurp a throne that didn't belong to him. But the truth is that Richard was a man of his time, one who, to his misfortune, lacked the \\"sun\\" personality, character and appearance of his brother Edward.  Is this a crime?  To Richard it was. <br />But this book is not only about Richard, the last of the Plantagenet kings.  It is also about Edward IV, George of Clarence, the Earl of Warwick, Anne Neville . . . It is about a fascinating time in history. <br />I read this book a long time ago (I have read everything Ms. Penman has written) and enjoyed it so much that I would like every reader out there to share in my experience.  Don't miss this book, it is the best of the historic fiction genre. <br />	2005-03-03

I agree!   And I don't know what to say about her research.  Had this been the true Eleanor of Aquitaine, certainly she would not be such an important figure in history, such an admired woman.  The true image of Eleanor is of a power-hungry woman, whose amorous adventures included her own uncle.  A woman who helped her sons rebel against their father so that she might rule England, Aquitaine, and every part of Henry's empire.  By this account, Eleanor was nothing of this.  She didn't fight Henry for power and for the right to rule beside him, but did it all for her children.  Right!  What's more, we must believe that the great Eleanor of Aquitaine was married to Louis of France for seven years before having sexual relations with him?  She was faithful to this man who was disgusting and cried all the time, besides being a religious fanatic and a little wacky?  I don't believe it.  Then, with Henry, a real man by her own account, ruthless as he might have been, she decides to be unfaithful, risking everything, including her own life and that of her brood?  And what about this ridiculous Rancon, so frequently dressed as Robin Hood!  A good name for this book would have been \\"The Singing Green Warrior\\".	2005-02-25

Usually when reading a trilogy, the first book is the best, and the series begins to lose steam as one goes on.  Not in this case. This is by far the best book of this trilogy. <br />Caitriona, daughter of Lord Duncan of Caithness, visits Byzantium with her father and sister, on her way to trace her father's footsteps during his sojourn (if you can call it that) in the Holy Land of many years ago.  Here their trip goes awry, and chaos begins.  Duncan is assassinated inside Agha Sophia, in the heart of Byzantium, by the evil Grand Master of the Knight Templars. <br />What follows is a witty and entertaining tale of adventure in exotic places, lead by a woman both vulnerable and strong, whose destiny has been traced long before her journey has begun. <br />I recommend this book to anyone who loves historical fiction.

This is such a case. <br />From the beginning, Duncan proves to be much less interesting than his father, Murdo, and his adventures are not as thrilling.  He is indeed helped by \\"Fortuna\\", for whatever he is seeking appears exactly where he is looking.  Too fortuitous for my taste. <br />I always look forward to sequels, but not always do you find a worthy one.

Even the story inside the story is less appealing in this book than it was in the first one. <br />	2005-02-15

As I grew up, history became my obsession; history in general, the middle ages in particular. I fell in love with new heroes whose exploits were as amazing as those of fiction. Then I discovered mysteries and again I couldn't have enough. So how can one author unite so brilliantly my three favorite subjects? Only when this author is Sharon Kay Penman! I entered Ms. Penman's world several years ago with one of her historical novels, and I was hooked for life. So it was only natural that when her first medieval mystery was published it would make its way into my hands. Medieval mysteries have become a popular genre, but no author masters the accuracy of the time as Ms. Penman does. I just finished reading the third installment in her series of medieval mysteries, \\"Dragon's Lair\\", and found myself pleasantly surprised that she could have improved on her two previous ones. \\"Dragon's Lair\\" takes our hero Justin de Quincy into Wales, where he must unravel the mysterious disappearance of a large portion of the ransom the Holy Roman Emperor has claimed to release King Richard from an Austrian dungeon, where he is being held captive. His younger brother John lusts after the crown and will stop at nothing to prevent his royal brother from buying his freedom and return to England. But Queen Eleanor, mother of both, will do anything in her power to free Richard, her favorite son, and return the rightful heir to the throne. David ab Owain, reigning Prince of Wales, conveniently accuses his nephew, Llewelyn ab Iorwerth, central character of Ms. Penman's second historical novel, \\"Here Be Dragons\\" of stealing the ransom. Taking a gamble, Justin joins forces with the rebel Welshman in an attempt to locate the stolen ransom and uncover the conspiracy. Treachery abounds in thirteenth century Wales and England. Corruption, murder, betrayal! Nothing new, but Ms. Penman makes it so fascinating to the reader that the book is impossible to put down. Masterfully handling both the historical facts and her imagination, again, Sharon Kay Penman has succeeded in giving us a gem!  <br />	2005-01-14

In this occasion and realizing Mr. Braggs is a good writer, the characters of the  book were, in my opinion, most of them despicable.  Zealous religious,  though not totally convinced of their own believes.  The best character in  the book is Reggiani, the pagan, who was the only one to make sense.  As  she asked Bega, &quot;Why do you have to pray so much?  Is your God  deaf?&quot;  I think this is the best line in the book.  But to zealous  Bega she was evil, and would not listen to her unless she embraced the True  Faith.  Luckily for me, Reggiani never did.  These religious fanatics were  so insecure, that they couldn't even discuss the matters, or at least try  to convince.  No, they only judge.  Fanatism at its best.  This is the book  that I have taken the longer to read.  Most of the time, I found it boring.  The main character, Bega, couldn't even love the boy Bede.
