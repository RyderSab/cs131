The vernacular language change they accept as good, the Vatican, medieval ethics and theology they ignore (and have been for decades.) Greeley himself comes from ethnic/cultural Catholicism with good music and colorful liturgies and customs, so he's got a good \\"born Catholic\\" culture to like.  <br /> <br />But there's little here in this compendium/rehash of Greeley's previous writings to lead someone not born into one of those likeable traditions to turn to Catholicism, or of help to anyone who converted because of the attraction of Catholic theology and the Vatican II vision of Church despite the poverty and disfunction of a local Irish Catholic culture of minimal liturgical beauty (concentration on \\"validity\\" as good enough) and little or awful music and zero spiritual content. Or who now find themselves stuck in a parish with all the same (updated with awful music) and now overlaid with a return of authoritarian top down heavy handed management from the Vatican and local bishops, the rollback of the Vatican reforms, and the crackdowns on the least signs of life in intellectual life, particularly in Catholic institutions. <br /> <br />What was the \\"Revolution\\"? It is when Catholics openly decided not to \\"receive\\" (i.e. ratify with \\"religious assent\\") fiats from the hierarchy that they found unreasonable, unworkable, and out of touch with reality. The hierarchy still hasn't gotten the message that if the Church (the faithful) doesn't \\"receive\\" a teaching (i.e. the believers don't believe it), it can't reflect the \\"sense of the faithful\\" no matter how the Vatican invokes infallibility of either the ordinary or papalmagisterium. The Vatican doesn't get it that they're function should be to express what the believers who are the Church believe, not tell them what they should believe based on some theoretical neo-scholastic theology and 13th century concepts that ignore everything humanity has learned about itself since. <br /> <br />Greeley's Catholics who stay because they like being Catholic are the ones the Revolution worked for because they've got a compatible or likeable Catholic cultural milieu to fit into. Those who don't, have little reason to stay.	2005-05-29

The reviewer is talking about strategies for growing your account.     When you're in the savings/growing mode you're in a whole different situation than you're in when you're having to withdraw and/or live off your account. Going from one to the other requires a major change in strategy and, more important, a MAJOR change in mindset and, often, life style.     You're confronted with a whole new set of regulations, whether the reason for the change is retirement, inheriting an account, etc. The biggest change in mindset is that instead of the pleasant pre-retirement situation of watching the money accumulate, you have to recognize that you're now going to be watching it DECLINE. And unless you've got a tremendously more than sufficient account, you're going to have to live with the knowledge that you could outlive the account, possibly due to your own mistakes, some of which this book can help you avoid.    Four years ago I was confronted with making this shift a whole lot sooner than I'd planned, and with getting control of my retirement accounts under conditions where I had little help. Without the previous edition of this NOLO book, I would have been totally lost and probably made serious mistakes.    Now, one caveat: This book does not tell you how to MANAGE your withdrawals and account so as to produce INCOME; as one should expect from NOLO press as a LEGAL advice publishing house, it deals with the nuts, bolts, traps and hazards of the PROCESS of getting the money out.    In my situation I also found that there is not a whole lot of good material out there on the subject of managing your money and account IN the WITHDRAWAL stage, and this subject is affecting more and more people, as the country shifts from defined benefit (pensions) plans to plans like 401Ks and IRAs that place the job of investing and managing on the individual. (Written 2005)     The above paragraph is still true (Mar 2011), but with the \\"boomer wave\\" of retirements hitting the advice industry, the situation is beginning to change. I'm seeing more professional literature about managing accounts for income and sustainability and the use of more realistic/conservative estimates of expected returns. Catch 22 right now is that most investments these days with acceptable risk are also virtually income-less. (CDs, USA bonds).     It is a whole lot more complex, risky, and stressful than most people realize, especially considering the general abysmal education (lack of) even young people receive on the subject, let alone people my age who were raised to count on pensions, etc. (And thank goodness for Social Security, which while far from adequate, can still supply a firm base of about 30 to 50% of a retirement income; although that's another issue)    So I recommend this book as essential for the basic procedures, but you will also need additional information on how to manage your income account(s). Personally, in addition to a good fee based financial planner, I found invaluable help from folks who have actually been doing the job for years, especially in the forums of Morningstar, for example. But you have to be on constant alert for scamsters and the whole \\"how to be a billionaire\\" publishing crowd. You're going to have to invest some serious time and effort in educating yourself for a the whole new job of retirement, and this book is an excellent place to start, preferably BEFORE you actually have to start TAKING YOUR MONEY OUT.	2005-05-05
US	53071944	R1KGXIITNEHFRR	0802826598	186148131	My Struggle for Freedom: Memoirs	Books	5	27	27	N	Y	5 star book 3 star translation	Fascinating reading for those interested in the background of the Vatican II council sessions and Kung's part in them; and in the development of his theology. And for understanding who he is, getting behind the media picture of the young theological \\"radical\\". What emerges is that the Vatican's biggest problem with Kung is that they don't scare him, can't browbeat him, and are arguing with a man trained in their own methods. <br /> <br />Oddly, the book is written (or translated?) all in the present tense, which can be confusing at times, when some use of past tense might distinguish between what Kung thought at the time and thinks now. I don't know if this is the translator, or the author himself; at times it gets annoying and tedious, even occasionally sounding pompous, which is not characteristic of Kung judging from everything else (and that's practically his entire opus available in English) I've read of his work.  <br /> <br />At any rate, the use of present tense is strange even in a memoir; I encountered it once previously in a biography, and almost couldn't finish that book.  <br /> <br />Kung's memoir also contains some assessments of others (including the late and current popes) that come off unkind and \\"snarky\\", which also doesn't seem typical of Kung, even in dealing with opponents, who I think he typically confounds by courteously sticking to his position and insisting on truth.  I can't help wondering if some of the \\"snarkiness\\" is also a product of the translation. <br /> <br />Also, there are, as noted by a previous reviewer, some odd translation errors, such as calling the USA Secretary of the Treasury \\"Finance Minister\\"; again, perhaps translation, or could be the translator trying to stay \\"true\\" (unnecessarily, in my view) to Kung's German? I have ordered the German edition (along with the new \\"Islam\\" volume) out of curiosity on this point. My German is labored, but I'm anxious to get started on the Islam volume, which could problably prove dangerous to Kung himself if it goes in the direction I suspect (urging modernization by subjecting the Islamic \\"scriptures\\" to exegesis, historical and form criticism commonly applied now for decades in Christian scriptural scholarship.)	2005-04-29

Similarly, a gay male is assumed to be unable to control himself in the presence of other males.     If this is indeed the case, given the huge male component of all occupations, a gay male would be placing himself in \\"an occasion of sin\\" by enterring practically any profession.    Grow up, people. We're all responsible for our own actions and self control.    I also find the translation \\"Banished Sons\\" rather odd: the more usual English reading of the prayer to Mary, the Salve Regina, from which this is derived is \\"exiled children of Eve,\\" the sense of which is that Christians are unhappy exiles, sighing and weeping in this \\"vale of tears\\", appealing to Mary to show them her son Jesus after their exile in this world. The traditional prayer, especially in its musical settings, is beautiful, but the sentiment and doctrine it is based on is rather quaint for the modern world.	2005-04-22

I was still asked for the ZIP for my school; I used my own. I then got a list of local schools or \\"Other\\" to choose from. I chose other, and entered \\"Independent Learner\\".  <br /> <br />The registration then completed; the confirmation stated it is only good for SIX MONTHS. <br /> <br />If you go to the main MyEconLab Web portal shown in the user manual after registering as a non-student, your user ID will not be recognized. You have to use a generic portal for the Mishkin textbook instead.  <br /> <br />What you get there is: <br /> <br />e-textbook, glossary, FLASH animated graphs, chapter quizzes and Web links from the textbook margins <br />The Weekly news selection (web links, so may expire; earliest was Aug. 2004) <br />The \\"Chapter Readings\\" in journals, etc. (ditto above) <br /> <br />Since these can expire at their parent web sites, I suggest you take the precaution of printing them out (I use Acrobat to make PDF files or download PDF files if available at the source). Also check out any links in the articles and do the same. <br /> <br />The Readings are probably the best of what you DO get, along with the animations and quizzes. The web links are updated, that's OK if you're not good at figuring that sort of thing out for yourself. <br /> <br />There is also a series of Chapter Appendices, not printed in the book, available with the e-text of the book at the alternate site. <br /> <br />WHAT YOU WON'T GET: <br /> <br />\\"Foundations Interactive\\" (whatever that is) <br />\\"MathXL for Econ\\" - the math review tutorial (would be nice) <br />\\"Research Navigator\\" <br />\\"eThemes of the Times\\" <br /> <br />The last two are a REAL Disappointment to me, because the Navigator (see textbook Preface) is supposed (among other things) to provide \\"a complete YEAR of search for full-text articles from the New York Times\\" and \\"Best of Web Link Library of peer-reviewed web sites.\\" The last is described in the Preface as \\"thematically related articles from the NYTimes accompanied by critical-thinking questions.\\" I was looking forward to these, because the NYTimes charges $$ by the article for archived (non-current) articles, and this can get expensive in a hurry, and an increasing number of other web sites, including industry association journals are now similarly archive and have paid access only. <br /> <br />So without being enrolled in a class that has an instructor who is using the course material software, you won't be able to access some of the BEST of the advertised materials of the MyEconLab add on.  <br /> <br />They could have been clearer about WHAT exactly you would have had access to. They also could have said that the non-student registration is only good for 6 months, since the description of the NYTimes access for a full year (which you don't get at all) might reasonably lead one to infer that the registration is valid for a year.  <br /> <br />And I fail to see why they couldn't throw in at least the Math review tutorial, since it wouldn't seem to involve any kind of outside contract or royalty such as the NYTimes access might.  <br />	2005-02-15

Catch 22 was that I couldn't access my retirement funds for about a year and a half after quitting. <br /> <br />I'd already ditched all but one credit card, reduced the balance on the last one and started paying off the entire balance each month, not charging more than I could pay. I had a small savings account, and had started saving regularly. But I really had no idea how much I spent on groceries or utilities, etc., I just paid the bills and didn't pay that much attention to where the money went. <br /> <br />So I really had no good idea how much I would need to get through the 18 months until my pension kicked in. I also had discovered that all the \\"retirement guru press\\" hype had led me to overestimate the probable yield of my retirement account, so I needed to get a more realistic idea of what income I could expect to withdraw from the account without outliving it and whether I could actually live with that. <br /> <br />The book prompted me to see how to actually figure out what I was spending. I did have a stash of grocery store receipts and bank statements, etc. I started keeping tract of ALL expenditures, as recommended, no matter how trivial, getting a paper receipt for everything. I compiled by category all the old receipts I had for over a year. The book helped me do that and identify where I could cut back. For one thing, I dropped a lot of subscriptions, cut down on fast food and started cooking more (I also lost 15 lbs doing that), set limits on gift expenditures, etc.  <br /> <br />The one drawback for me with the book was the categories on the forms didn't really suit me (I regard my Internet subscription as a \\"utility\\" just like phone and heat), so I got a multi-column account book, invented my own categories, and started keeping it on a monthly basis, estimating and limiting from the older stuff I'd compiled, and adding for inflation, especially on taxes, heath insurance premiums, and utilities. I was surprised how little time it took; the preliminary effort took 2 weekends, and then just an hour or so a week (now down to a couple of hours a month, a reality check mid-month and then total up at the end.) <br /> <br />This enabled me to retire as planned in a year and get through the interim incomeless period. I've continued to keep the expense records and budget for 3 years now, managing my money much better, with no unpleasant surprises. I was even able to handle an medical emergency this year without problem. <br /> <br />This is a good book: if you're serious about getting control of your financial life, it will give you the structure to do it. Go for it!	2004-12-22

I was engaged in a total immersion crash course in investing (long overdue), being newly retired and confronted with managing for income a rollover IRA (having disengaged a 401K from my former employer) which was my primary asset outside of my house. The market had just crashed, and would go down further. Better late than never, but a painful six months educational process, as I learned how to reconfigure and manage the IRA myself. <br />  <br />The book and course convinced me that REITs belonged in my portfolio and I allocated a portion of it (initially 7%) to a combination of individual REITs and a highly rated REIT mutual fund. Prices were down along with the rest of the market, so in that respect it was beginners luck.  <br /> <br />However, I used Block as a mentor and watched which REITs he favored in a fund he managed (which had too high an entry investment threshold for me to get into myself). I acquired a few more individual REITs in the following year when the market dipped. It has turned out to be a valuable investment and helped noticeably to reduce risk by diversifying the portfolio, and has also yielded a steady portion of income. The book was essential for review and reference in the practical business of managing my REIT segment of a \\"long haul\\" and income portfolio, vetting possible acquisitions and navigating the jargon of REIT annual reports. <br /> <br />I would note that Block puts out a monthly newletter discussing the REIT world, online at Essentialreit.com site: recommended for keeping uptodate. Block's discussions are not for casual reading, but like the book, if you're willing to put in the time and effort, it can be very rewarding. (And amusing too, as he has a great sense of humor andpulls no punchs) Thanx Ralph!	2004-12-18

I gave away my microwave because it was so noisy and also because I couldn't get the hang of the short times, and had to check all the time, or else forgot about it when engrossed in a project. <br /> <br />So most of my evening meals are cassarole type one dish things I do in a conventional oven. I eat little meat, because I can't keep it and don't like to shop more than once every week or two. I'm the type who figures out what to eat no more than an hour before it goes in the oven. I figured out how to do rice and pasta dishes in the oven as one shot, one dish operations, although they would probably dismay a \\"real cook\\". I use frozen soy meat subsitutes a lot because I don't have to worry about waste from spoilage. <br /> <br />Some relatives gave me a little 1.5 qt slow cooker for Christmas, and I thought it might work out because I remembered the bean pot and soup pot my mother had going all the time when I was a child (we had a wood stove for both cooking and heat.) <br /> <br />But when I read the book that came with the cooker and saw all the recipes need stove top preparations, I almost gave it away. But discovered two uses for it: baked potatoes and hot sandwiches. You wrap up a big potato in foil at breakfast time and its done for supper (top with plain yogurt and/or cream cheese); breakfast sandwiches are cream cheese and jam on brown bread wrapped in foil ready in an hour. Lunch sandwiches are brown bread and cheese with chopped stir fry veggies (snow peas, green beans, water chesnut, carrot etc. and wrapped in foil. <br /> <br />I got this cookbook in hopes of extending my recipes, and I probably will be able to; it explains better about beans than the one that came with my cooker. But I virtually live on rice and pasta dishes, and those all seem to need extra stove top steps.  <br /> <br />As other reviews say, lots of slow cooker recipes are NOT one step \\"put all the ingredients in and plug it in\\" operations. This book repeats that old chesnut in the intro, but most of the recipes need stove top operations. That doesn't work for those going out to work, or else require foresight and preparation the night before. But some of the recipes I think I can work out for me in my lifestyle. <br /> <br />But I will probably have to get another cooker, as my little baby one has only one temperature level (no controls, you plug it in, period), and doesn't have a removable liner, so all my cooking so far (mostly potatoes) has been in foil. The best thing about slow cooker cooking is that if you're absent minded (or ignore timers when they go off when you're engrossed in something), an extra hour or two doesn't result in a ruined meal; maybe not optimal, but still edible, and usually even still fine and tasty. <br />	2004-11-07

But like some other reviewers, I found the style - especially the present tense - awfully annoying and tedious. It also seemed halfway between historical fiction and scientific biography, with all the reconstructed (or imagained?) conversations and thoughts; and you can't which are which. The extensive documentation endnotes indicate that some of these reconstructions are based on letters, etc., but there's no way to tell, and much of it seems just too far over the edge into historical fiction. I enjoy historic fiction very much, but that's not what I was looking for here, and felt I'd been drawn in under false pretenses. Overall, interesting but a tough slog of a read, even if you're really interested in the subject.	2004-11-04

I finally upgraded to v. 10 and bought Classroom In a Book for that version. You CAN teach yourself Illustrator with the manual and this book in a few weeks. ICIAB is a good supplement to the manual, which for reasons that always baffled me, has too few illustrations for information aimed at visually oriented people. <br />You will have to do some experimentation to get full benefit from the lessons, but I picked up things I was clueless on before. It does help to have some additional book such as Visual series (PeachPit Press) for details not covered. <br />Downside: some errors of tools or keys, nothing serious. But I was disappointed by two topics; the web chapter separately covers making a Flash animation for the web, and slicing a graphic for the web, but while the &quot;finished&quot; version of the lesson shows both in a complete web page, the lesson doesn't tell you how to put them together without the Adobe Web program (too expensive for me). You have put both html files in a text editor and combine them using the complete example for reference as to where to put the Flash file and what to include or leave out.<br />Also, the section in lesson 6 on data/variable objects is applied in a page of business cards, but doesn't explain how to get the data base and variable fields applied to all incidences of the biz cards on the sheet. I did figure it out for myself, but it took me about an hour of experiment, and is almost as tedious as just editing the file, though once the database is set up it would be quick to print out new cards with the variations.<br />But overall, a really good way to learn Illustrator to an intermediate level, and a whole lot cheaper than any class I've looked into (plus classes tend to be taught on MACs in my area).	2003-10-24

It would be too confusing to have wages in one indexed amount and rent or mortgages in another, etc. How would anyone ever get a feel for where they stood, i.e. how much they had to earn to pay the rent? What if the wages index suffered more from inflation than the mortgage index or vice versa?<br />I think one indexed value for all long term contracts such as wages, rent, mortgages, credit purchases, savings/ investment accounts, etc. maybe even such things as magazine subscriptions and major goods like autos, and appliances would work, but I think people would still prefer to use hand currency values for day to day shopping, so they could compare what they want to spend to the currency value of their accounts. Otherwise it would be too much like flying blind.<br />Something that has puzzled me recently about academic and &quot;serious&quot; presses: where are the editors? <br />This book has an astonishing number of typos, bad or marginal grammar, doubled verbs, incomplete sentences, you name it. I constantly found myself having to back up and read a passage over again because I though I knew where it was headed only to find that the verb didn't match the subject, or what sounded like an idiomatic expression wasn't (it only coincidentally reproduced the idiom), etc. The extensive list of acknowledgements didn't include an editor specifically; the book reads like maybe some of the dozens of graduate students involved are ESL.

Perhaps partly I could identify with discovering a native talent (no, not chess) not usually associated with girls/women and/or the very young.<br />But primarily this is a story of the triumph of a unique human spirit housed in the form of an ordinary looking young girl with an unusual number of strikes against her.

So Will's book may be an apologia pro vita sua, but no argument for some one who wasn't born & raised in the Roman Church. Perhaps the title should have been \\"Why I am Still a Catholic.\\"<br />He states that the papacy is a \\"sacrament of the unity of the Church.\\" At most, he must mean sacrament equals symbol. Certainly not sacrament as generally understood in classic Catholic terminology, which defines a sacrament as \\"the outward sign of an inward grace\\", or as a symbol or symbolic action that actually has the power to achieve what it symbolizes (e.g. baptism actuates the salvation of the baptized.)<BR> <BR>Far from being a sacrament of unity, or actuating the unity of the Church, the papacy has been from its beginnings, and continues to be today, one of the most divisive institutions or ideas in Christianity, compared to which the ancient theological arguments over the filioque pale to a semantic quibble. The current occupant and his Curial cohort of papal absolutists continue to issue pronouncements dividing the Roman Catholic remnant into sheep and goats (right thinkers and deviants, obedient children and heretical rebels), and erect new barriers to inter-faith understanding (e.g. the recent canonization of a priest who saved Christian European Civilization from the infidel Turks.) The papacy can't even unite the Roman Catholic \\"Church\\", let alone Christians (the bibical meaning of \\"Church\\"). It would have been more plausible to cite Baptism, or even the Creed, on which Wills pins his continued self-identity as Catholic, as symbols (\\"sacraments\\" in the classic sense) of the unity of Christians.<BR> <BR>Thirty years ago,when I was a newly minted American Roman Catholic (from a devout and educated Protestant background), an elderly Irish Catholic neighbor profoundly shocked me by informing me that I would never be \\"a real Catholic\\" because I wasn't born and raised one. I have been coming to the conclusion that she was right after all. There are just too many issues that would require me to (in Wills' phrase) \\"check my brains at the church door\\" and out of some kind of misguided loyalty force myself to give \\"religious assent\\" to concepts that fly in the face of reason, history and reality. Speaking only for myself and no one else, as long as the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church continues to foist such propositions on the rest of the body, I find it increasingly difficult to view silent acquiescence as faithful loyal opposition instead of self-delusion or hypocrisy.<BR> <BR>That said, Wills' book makes a good read, interesting stuff in there about the history of the papacy, and his understanding of the Creed and Lord's Prayer, arising from his knowledge of Greek. <br />I was also intrigued by his account of Jesuit education; it went a long way toward explaining something that puzzled me when I was a new convert, namely why a young Jesuit priest I approached with theological questions and a desire for spiritual direction (expecting from the Jesuit reputation for education and Ignation spirituality that any Jesuit would be expert in such matters) instead fled like I'd made an indecent proposal. The poor man had probably not advanced to the stage where theology is studied, and his spiritual training probably didn't go beyond the Jesuit boot camp run through of the Ignatian Exercises.	2003-05-12

When the topic became a no-no for discussion according to the Vatican, the monks destroyed their 1300 remaining copies. The method of destruction however may (deniably, of course) have been a subtle answer to the Vatican clamp down on discussion. The monks burned the books in their furnace system, generating thereby for themselves &quot;light and warmth&quot;. Painful as the experience was for author Sister Lavinia Byrne, she also could appreciate the humor.	2003-05-06

It is a function of the whole screwy crafts book business, which is the realm of most English language origami publication. Only a few superstars or self-publishers have any kind of control over publication of their work. <br />The way it works: in order to publish, most artists must settle for a one time purchase of manuscripts or rights (no on going royalties). They also totally lose control over future publication of the material, so it is common for publishers to edit, combine, etc material into later books, usually resulting in the downgrading of the material. One artist I know recently had the experience of a publisher releasing his material in a new format that didn't even acknowledge his name/authorship on the cover!<br />The sole recourse of the artist is not to use the publisher again, but this is pretty ineffectual as the crafts publishers could care less. They can go on publishing the material in any form they like.<br />So your best bet is to check the actual book at a store, return it to amazon for refund, or subscribe to origami publications to learn about \\"real\\" new books.	2003-04-15
US	53071944	R375L0HVOF7IAB	0679724524	683944327	The Apocrypha	Books	4	19	23	N	Y	What this is, and isn't	These are not, as one review says, \\"early Christian\\" works; they are later Jewish writings, some from the first century before Christ.<BR> <BR>Also, though as other reviewers point out, none are in the Protestant \\"canon\\" (the original \\"Revised Standard Version\\" issued a one volume version of them a few decades ago, introducing them to many Protestant lay people for the first time). <br />They are, in various combinations, in the Roman Catholic canon (e.g. New American Bible translation, authorized for use in the American Catholic Church), and in the canons of the various Orthodox (Eastern) Churches. Communicants of those churches should consult their own authorized canonical versions of the Bible to determine which specifically are recognized by their church. Anyone generally interested can consult the New Oxford Revised Standard Version with the Aphocrypha, which includes notes on the various books and a table of which are included in the various \\"canons\\" (often under different names, or incorporated in the text of books recognized as canonical by Protestants, e.g. Esther, Daniel.)<br />Protestants might like to inquire into the process of exclusion of various of these books; often it was becaused they are used by the Roman and Eastern churches to support doctrines rejected by Protestants, e.g. prayers for the dead. A single verse might have been enough to result in exclusion.<br />The \\"canon(s)\\" of the Bible as we know it (them) are the result of centuries of argument, and many of the early church fathers rejected or accepted books that were later held the opposite when the Bible as we know it finally settled into its current form. <br />But the \\"Apocrypha\\" can at the very least supply missing Western cultural references for Protestant readers (the stories of Bel and the Dragon and Susanna), and at best provide some beautiful spiritual reading from late Jewish Wisdom literature.	2003-01-22
US	53071944	R2F8FJ77EOSQP0	0071386262	640323191	Financial Shenanigans: How to Detect Accounting Gimmicks & Fraud in Financial Reports, Second Edition	Books	3	21	25	N	Y	A good read but..	Financial Shenanigans is written apparently with a popular audience in mind, but you really ought to have some previous experience in reading financial statements. Individual investors should should be practiced at researching firms with at least the resources available free/cheap on the web.<br />The book covers the same disasters as 2 or 3 others I've read, but is more subjective/judgemental in tone and less thorough. It also tends to sound like an promo for the author's business (research institute), where you get absolutely nothing for less than $300 (which works out to about $100/pg I think for reports.)<br />The book is also marred for non-professional readers by careless editing than left typos, misplaced phrases. A number of the tables for example financial statement analysis are riddled with what I imagine might be a spreadsheet font/formating problem that truncates 4 digit numbers to the left 3 digits. Most can be spotted by the form \\"x,xx\\" with the comma separator the clue, but three digit numbers chopped to two aren't so obvious, and to get the numbers to add up correctly you have to do a little tinkering to figure out which are missing a digit. Not critical, but very annoying, and doesn't look good for a book about meticulous ferreting out of subtle accounting ploys.<br />Still, it may help improve do-it-yourself research & analysis.	2002-08-03

You can't readily get numbers from one to another. And the disk titles are of the &quot;sheet23.xls&quot; variety, not helpful for finding the one you want, so you have to either have the book listing handy or access them strictly from the CD PDF file text.<br />Being used to technical book web sites that contain errata, new material, suggestions from users, etc., I was disappointed to find nothing new there. And the list of web links, as usual in this fast-changing world, contains a number of missing links. I would have appreciated a good old fashioned bibliography in addition to the links, because you can usually find out of print books through a library, used dealers on the web, and most really important books and texts have current editions.	2002-08-03

A very disappointing set of books, reads like strung together clippings of (primarily) political events from newspapers. Inconsistent in places, dead wrong in others, practically no synthesis. OK perhaps if you want an outline of some of the major events and when they occurred, but to get the significance and any depth of analysis, you'll have to look elsewhere. One of the strangest excuses for &quot;History&quot; I've ever read.	2002-07-18

These are short, condensed reviews of subjects, for reference and refreshing.<BR>If you want a teaching book by this author (Omer Carey), check the used section for &quot;Financial Tools for Small Businesses&quot;, a 1983 275pg paperbook so good it still sells for 25-35$US. Its a meaty, practical course with lots of real world, substantial case studies/exercises to work through. Even if all you want to do is learn how to interpret annual reports, its a winner. It is pre-spreadsheet software (at least for many folks), so you'll want to supplement it by identifying the corresponding Excel functions to accomplish the math. (But try it by hand first, you'll learn more.)	2002-07-05
