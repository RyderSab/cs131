I've read and loved all of these books and it's wonderful to see the readers get another shot at these wonderful stories.   CINDERMAN is a delicious and sexy fantasy.  CRY FOR THE MOON will touch the heart and CHASING TROUBLE is a delightful take-off on The Maltese Falcon.  Anne Stuart's soaring imagination is surpassed only by her way with words and her skill at creating some of the hottest heroes ever written in romance or any other genre.  Triple the stories, triple the fun!	2001-04-21

This was the first book I read by this author, but it won't be the last.  If you love the old Beauty and the Beast TV series or the Disney movie, you'll love this book.  It was so romantic with Bernard watching over Gwendolyn while she slept and falling in love with his &quot;captive&quot;.  They said such funny things to each other.  I loved Tuper and her sister, too.  I laughed.  I cried.  And I never wanted the story to end.  More, please!	2001-04-20

I've loved all of this author's books, but I think this is one of her best.  The interactions between Gwen and her &quot;Dragon&quot; were so tender and funny.  He seemed to understand her in a way that none of the villagers or her family did.  And they were so sexy together, even when they were just talking.  I bought the paperback, but now I'm off to search for the hardcover for my Keeper collection!	2001-04-19

I caught myself laughing out loud over the snappy dialogue and keen wit and nearly fell off the couch when Evie and Wyatt crashed the wrong reunion.  But contrary to what some of the reviews may lead you to believe, the book is not just a fun romp.  With an amazingly deft touch, Ms. Bevarly peels away her characters' defenses to  reveal the complex relationships and histories that they share.  The dialogue between both couples rings so true that you feel them falling in love and know beyond the shadow of a doubt that their futures together will be bright ones.  HE COULD BE THE ONE is my favorite kind of book--a romantic comedy with heart.	2001-04-12
US	51972737	R1YKXZSTV6JDE6	1575668033	21470983	Tempting	Books	1	5	8	N	N	A sad state of affairs	It breaks my heart to see a writer as talented as Susan Johnson mistaking pornography for women's erotica.  Having chararacters repeatedly use the &quot;F&quot; word and the &quot;C&quot; word as she has done in TEMPTED and in her last few books is hardly erotic, unless you're a 14-year-old boy.  Women's erotica has the potential to be a delicious sub-genre within the romance genre with heroines experiencing explosive love scenes and exploring various forbidden fantasies, such as the captive fantasy.  The whole point of women's erotica is that it's sexual fantasy as WOMEN long to read about it, not as some pale and sordid reflection of the male fantasy typified in your average men's magazine.  I can only hope Ms. Johnson returns to the type of storytelling she does best--well-written stories about relationships where the two protagonists are capable of tenderness as well as lust.	2001-04-06

Annie Newcastle is a sassy, hilarious heroine with a distinctive voice.  This book reminded me of one of Larry McMurtry's funnier westerns because it combined humor and pathos.  The characters and dialogue are priceless.  I especially loved Sam Two Trees'  dry wit.  I'm heartbroken that Ms. Recknor's earlier efforts seem to be out of print (What is Avon thinking???) but I'm off to search for them in an out-of-print store.  After reading PROPHET ANNIE, I would definitely buy anything this author writes--paperback or hardcover--as soon as it hits the shelves because you just don't discover a treasure like this very often.	2001-03-27

I'm usually a tough audience for this type of &quot;women's fiction&quot; because I don't like feeling that I'm being manipulated into reaching for the Kleenex, but this book didn't manipulate me; it transported me into the minds and emotions of its characters.  I found myself swept away to SUMMER ISLAND where a mother and daughter rediscover each other and the selves they thought they'd lost forever.  This is a book about relationships, a book about the unbreakable ties that bind families and friends together, and a book about how short and precious this life really is and how very little time we can afford to waste.  Not only is Kristin a consummate storyteller, she is also an exquisite writer who is able to use the simplest of words to capture the most complex of emotions.  Ruby and Nora Bridge are characters I won't soon forget and SUMMER ISLAND is a book that definitely deserves to be on all the &quot;Best of...&quot; lists for 2001.	2001-03-19

In ON BEAR MOUNTAIN, Deborah Smith gives us unforgettable characters in an irresistible setting, all bound together by an inextricable sense of destiny.  She does destiny nearly as well as John Irving, but her voice is all her own--uniquely Southern, by turns gritty and gentle, soft and sassy, and etched with a tender irony that can make you laugh out loud or break your heart. She writes with genuine emotion and sentiment, but never stoops to manipulative sentimentality.  Like her protagonist, Quentin Rinconni, she is a brilliant and sensitive artist who can instinctively find and give meaning to the complex patterns that define even the most ordinary of lives.  Bravo, Ms. Smith, and thanks for another extraordinary read!	2001-02-27

The suspense didn't overshadow the romance and the romance didn't overshadow the suspense.  Jaine was an utterly delightful protagonist and Sam was indeed a &quot;Dream Man&quot;.  I'll definitely be buying Ms. Howard's next hardcover based on how great this one was.	2001-02-08

She takes my most primal fantasies, both sexual and emotional, and sets them to prose the way a master composer sets words to music.  This Tarzan/King Kong/Beauty and the Beast story captivated me from the very first page.  It was sheer perfection from start to finish and I was flipping pages like crazy toward the end.  (I kept picturing Meg Ryan as Elizabeth.) My only complaint was that it could have gone on for 800 pages and it still wouldn't have been enough.  WILD THING, I think I love you!	2000-10-28

Yes, you have to have an appreciation for satire and keen wit to truly take Medeiros's work to heart because she writes so darned &quot;smart&quot;.

She's been one of my favorite authors for years and I always  wait eagerly for her next book to be released.  SHADOWS AND SUNSET was  fabulous!  I read it on the beach in nearly one sitting.  I love her  moody-broody heroes who never turn out to be quite as wicked as they think  they are.  The underlying theme of her books is always redemption and  nobody does it better.  At the end of this book, you truly believed that  Jilly and Coltrane could create a happy and passionate life together.   SHADOWS drips with delicious atmosphere and the secondary love story is  just as compelling as the primary one.	2000-09-18

Unlike some suspense authors, you can always count on Hoag to  draw you into the emotional lives of her characters and Kovac and Liska are  no exception.  That adds another layer to the suspense because you actually  care about the protagonists.  It was also sort of a relief to read a  suspense novel that wasn't about a serial killer.  Serial killers have  always been hard to warm up to for me because they don't have any  particular passion for their victims, just for the kill.  But DUST TO DUST  had a genuine mystery to solve with  the lives of everyone involved being  changed forever.  I loved it!	2000-08-14

I love being able to buy my favorite romances in hardcover because  paperbacks just don't last the same.  But I did think the price on this one  was great.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down!  I read it in  one sitting and don't think I'll ever forget Gwen and her  &quot;Dragon&quot;.  I've always been a fan of the &quot;Beauty and the  Beast&quot; TV show and that's what this book reminded me of.  I'd rather  buy one great hardcover than two so-so paperbacks any day.	2000-07-08

All I can say is &quot;Wow!&quot;  I finished this book with tears streaming down my face.  Ruth Wind makes every word of this story sing.  I felt the rain on my face, I tasted the buttery crunch of sweet corn on the  cob and most of all, I felt every emotion that Blue Reynard and his Ellie  experienced as they were falling in love.  When you add a tantalizing  mystery and the story of a woman discovering herself by discovering her  past, you end up with an irresistible and empowering piece of women's  fiction.  It takes incredible skill to blend growing orchids and Vietnam  and race relations and romance, but Ruth Wind makes it look effortless.   I'm off to the Romance Writers of America site to vote for this brilliant  and touching book as Favorite Book of the Year.	2000-07-05

Teresa Medeiros has been one of my favorite authors since way back when and she just keeps getting better.  I didn't think she could top CHARMING THE PRINCE, but she did it with this one.  I can't explain why her writing  is so powerful, but she makes me feel all of the emotions her characters  are feeling.  I fell in love with &quot;the Dragon&quot; right along with  Gwendolyn and to me, that's true magic!  (I have to confess that I also  fell a little in love with Tupper, too!)  I also loved the fact that her  heroine wasn't a size 2 in this book, but a &quot;plump&quot; beauty.   (Just like me!)	2000-06-14

I don't know how this author keeps coming up with such innovative plots, but this is definitely one that would make a great movie.  I adored Dorsey, fell in love with Adam, and was amazed by the way the  secondary characters like Carlotta and Lucas jumped right off the page into  my heart.  And as always, Ms. Beverly's writing sang with style and charm.   So many books today seem sort of generic, but this writer's voice is so  strong it keeps me coming back for more.	2000-06-13

Yes, it had a slightly more leisurely pace and more description than is &quot;politically correct&quot; these days, but to be honest, I found it to be a refreshing  change of pace.  It was almost as if the author was gently seducing me into  the story and boy, once she had me, I didn't want her to let me go!  Before  I even realized it, I had read huge chunks and was nearing the end.  Aside  from being a powerful and beautifully written romance, it was also a great  female wish fulfillment story.  Who wouldn't want to leave behind the  hustle and bustle of modern life to live in a charming cottage and eat  fairy cakes with Maybelle while being wooed by the gorgeous  &quot;gardener&quot; next door?  Laurel and Dane are both on a search for  self, but in the process, they find each other and that's truly the  greatest magic of all.  So grab a hot cup of tea, curl up in a comfy chair,  open ONE SUMMER'S NIGHT and prepare to be enchanted!	2000-05-15

First, the movie star guy was so awful and two-dimensional that I couldn't figure out why the heroine EVER fell in  love with him in the first place.  (So I lost respect for her.) I had the  same problem with the &quot;hero&quot; in Ms. Hannah's HOME AGAIN.  He was  never redeemed in my eyes and quite frankly, I didn't care if he got a  heart transplant and lived or not.  I also thought the conflict in this  book didn't really start until Michaela woke up from the coma, then the  book ended too quickly.  I think the writing was very good, but the book  needed more genuine sentiment and less sentimentality.  I did love Dr. Liam  and also loved the main message of the book which is that true love isn't  the fireworks, but the glowing embers that can last a lifetime.	2000-05-13

If you cut your teeth on the &quot;candy romances&quot; with no substance that are so prevalent today, you might be  intimidated by the passion and power of this book.  But I loved it!  Real  things were at stake with Conn and Gelina--their love, their loyalties,  their futures, even their lives.  I wish there were more books on the  market right now with this kind of depth.	2000-04-30

Contrary to what the &quot;politically correct&quot; police may have determined, there is NO RAPE in this book. Wynter and Charlotte's mating ritual may be a little primitive at times, but I can assure you that it was  all consensual.  Was it a little naughty?  Yes...  Was it more fun than a  barrel of monkeys?  Absolutely!   The only thing more annoying than men  censoring women's fantasies is other women attempting to censor them.  So  if you enjoy a rousing romance that doesn't always bow to the current  climate of political correctness, RULES OF SURRENDER is the book for you.   (And Wynter can &quot;master&quot; me anyday!)	2000-04-09

As a writer, her &quot;voice&quot; is incredibly unique and she manages to come up with a  fresh idea in every book.  This book captivated my attention from the first  page to the last.  The sparring between Wynter and Charlotte was priceless  and every secondary character was beautifully drawn.  (Loved seeing Adorna  from THAT SCANDALOUS EVENING again.)

I swear I'm not a prude, but the use of the &quot;F&quot; word every other line was very jarring.  It would have been  much more effective as a dramatic tool if it had been used more sparingly.   For me, it crossed the line from bawdy to crass.  I can handle the concept  of deliciously naughty, but this was more like a rebellious teenager trying  to shock a maiden aunt--it was cute the first ten times, then it became  annoying.  I thought last year's CRAZY FOR YOU was a much more full-bodied  book with more admirable characters.  I love to buy friends and family  Jennifer Crusie hardcovers for Christmas, but I was dismayed to realize  that I can't give this book to most of the people I know because of the  language.  This was really my only complaint because I loved the setting,  loved the characters, humor, and snappy dialogue.	2000-03-23

I loved her earlier books where you could always count on her to break your heart AND make you smile and I love her lighter books.  FIRST LADY kept me  entranced from start to finish.  The interaction between Matt, Nealy, Lucy,  and Button in the Winnebago was priceless!  The book kept me smiling, but  there were plenty of deeper threads woven throughout the story that tugged  at my heart.  It takes tremendous skill as a writer to do both.

I had read A HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIONS  when I was a child and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed this book  because that wry, witty writing style is just as present in that  &quot;children's&quot; novel.

I'm sitting here with tears streaming down my cheeks and an irrepressible urge to jump to my feet and yell, \\"Bravo!  Bravo!\\"  I just finished MIXED SIGNALS and it absolutely blew me away.  I can't believe it was a first  novel because it read like it was the author's thirty-fifth book.  The  prose was incandescent, each character fully realized and unforgettable,  and it fully captured the magic of falling in love. And the author hit the  inspirational notes with such a light and deft hand that I can feel  comfortable giving this book to my non-Christian friends in the hopes that  some subtle seeds will be sown. MIXED SIGNALS could hold its own against  any secular contemporary on the market today-even those by the romance  genre's top authors.  I have to admit that I'm a pretty jaded reader, which  is why it's even more rare for a book to strike this chord in me,  especially a first novel.  If it wouldn't be a sin, I'd be bowing at Ms.  Higg's feet &lt;g&gt;, but as it is, I'm thanking the Lord for bringing  such a special read into my life and hoping the rest of the world is ready  to welcome a writer with such an amazing and divine gift to touch both the  mind and the heart.	2000-02-06

Some of the jabs in other reviews regarding historical accuracy are inaccurate themselves.  Parents have always cared about their children, in a medieval  setting or any other.  This is demonstrated through the many diaries and  accounts available in books such A HISTORY OF PRIVATE LIFE and the HOLY  BIBLE.  People have always been people and although the times they lived in  might have changed, their emotions have remained fairly constant.  I think  Ms. Medieros did a marvelous job capturing these emotions for the reader.   Bravo!	2000-02-02

After finishing this book, I immediately rushed to the RomanceWriters of America website and nominated it for Book of the Year. Theauthor did a terrific job with a very complex and moving story. The &quot;making-of-a-movie&quot; setting was fresh and intriguing. Everything about the book rang true for me. The primary romance was sexy, sweet, and totally believable while the secondary romance won my heart as well. This is a fantastic book. If you like Nora Roberts, I strongly urge you to give this book a read!	1999-09-25
US	51972737	RI6GP7A8S1USU	042516246X	681910708	Bitterroot Landing	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Interesting but disgusting	I understood the whole incest/sexual abuse survivor symbolism, but there was way too much obsession with sexual organ and bodily fluids for me.  I kept reading when the &quot;heroine&quot; was eating scabs from her own  body, but she lost me when she started fingerpainting with her own  menstural blood.  When the book sent me to my own commode to retch, I knew  it was time to stop reading.  A lighter touch on a lot of the symbolism  would have been more harrowing and more effective	1999-09-07

I have to disagree with some of the amateur &quot;reviewers&quot; who didn't like Kit.  Sure, she could be a brat at times, but boy, was she motivated!  I'm so tired of reading about noble,  flawless heroines I can't identify with.  I mean, look at GONE WITH THE  WIND!  Who do you remember?  Scarlett or Melanie?  I hope Ms. Beverly  writes many more heroines I can identify with and many more heroes like  Pendleton that I can swoon over!	1999-08-05
US	51972737	R2V43CY7AWLBVM	0553103938	838514831	Dream Stone	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Weaves a spell of enchantment!	This is a challenging fantasy novel.  You have to pay attention to almost every sentence so you won't get lost in this fantastical world, but it's well worth it. Glenna McReynolds is a master weaver of words who gently  draws you into her web of dreams.  Be patient and your rewards will be  great!  This book is much more of a fantasy than a romance, but the romance  that is at the core is exquisitely written and deeply moving.  I'll  definitely be looking for the next book in the series.	1999-07-05
US	51972737	R2LQ5P9KI25N2W	006101365X	129794075	Sweetwood Bride	Books	5	5	6	N	N	One of my favorite Pamela Morsi books	SWEETWOOD BRIDE was a wonderful effort!  The dialogue that comes out of the mouths of Pamela Morsi's characters rings with such truth that they can't help but become real to the reader.  Everyone in the Tennessee  community of Sweetwood was a fully fleshed out human being.  It reminded me  a little of one of my favorite TV shows of all-time--THE WALTONS.  (Oh, and  did I forget to mention the delicious love scenes?) This book made me feel  like I could sit back, relax, and just enjoy the ride because I was in the  hands of a master storyteller.	1999-06-20
US	51972737	R9ZTCZ142FYVK	0312969759	930682662	Keepsake	Books	5	33	33	N	N	Fabulous book!	Antoinette Stockenberg is one of my all-time favorite authors and KEEPSAKE is one of her best.  Quinn and Olivia manage to be both admirable and interesting and the mystery kept me guessing until the very end.  As far as  I'm concerned, Ms. Stockenberg is the only writer working today who could  be an heir to Mary Stewart's romantic suspense crown.	1999-05-29

After reading MY MAN PENDLETON, I couldn't wait to get Ms. Bevarly's next single title and I can promise you it was well worth the wait.  Leo and Lily are one of the  hottest (and funniest!) couples to come along in ages.  I loved their witty  repartee and the clever twists and turns the author wove into the plot.   I'll be first in line to buy her next romantic comedy!	1999-05-18

Lee and Mary resonate like real people you'd love to know and I found myself rooting for their happy ending from the very first  page.  I can't wait to read Ms. Lee's next bestseller!	1999-05-14
US	51972737	R2PIA95QWDJEUL	0671003593	923679266	An Angel for Emily	Books	1	6	6	N	N	Where's the editor?	My question isn't, &quot;What's happened to Ms. Deveraux?&quot;, it's &quot;What's happened to her editor?&quot;  She's one of my all-time favorite authors, but reading her last few books has been like watching a  train wreck you were powerless to prevent.  The ideas are there; the  stories have the potential for magic, but apparently her publisher has  decided that once you reach a certain level of success, you no longer need  editing.  (Judith McNaught seems to be suffering from the same syndrome.)   Please editors, help restore the voices of these once fabulous authors!	1999-04-20

It didn't take long to read and I devoured every word.  At first the book appears deceptively simple--a spunky little girl lost in the woods, but King uses this twisted nature tome to explore the very  nature of God.  I would have bawled like a kid after reading the last scene  if I hadn't been on my way to a dinner date and hadn't wanted to mess up my  make-up.	1999-04-16

There was just something off about the pacing.  From the very first scene, it was difficult to get a handle on what the book was  supposed to be ABOUT.  I'm giving it 3 stars because Ms.Robert's actual  writing was excellent as usual. It was simply the story structure and  pacing that struck an off-key note with me.	1999-04-14
US	51972737	R10GD3LFAQA0J7	0451450965	925239569	A Fine and Private Place	Books	5	5	5	N	N	One of my all-time favorites	This has been one of my all-time favorite books since I was a kid.  One of the reviewers feared a let-down if he re-read the book now, but I did just that last summer (my copy is pretty dog-eared so I'm thrilled that they're  releasing a new edition).  I must confess that I wasn't the least bit let  down.  The story was just as whimsical and touching as I remembered it to  be, with some profound lessons about death, and more importantly, life.   I've always loved cemeteries because of this book.	1999-03-24
US	51972737	R3T3ENAS7P843D	0553106333	14890872	Ashes to Ashes	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Absolutely fabulous	I think ASHES TO ASHES is awesome, truly one of Hoag's best.  The writing was crisp, the dialogue razor-sharp and incredibly witty, the characterizations flawless.  This book could be brought to the big screen  with virtually no tweaking. Nearly every line had emotional impact, even  the descriptions of Minneapolis in November.  This is a real star turn for  an author who out-suspenses Grisham, Cornwall, and both Pattersons.  If  you're looking for a book you won't want to put down until you've turned  the last page, this is it!	1999-03-11

US	51972737	RBDGVT8KNQ0F1	0440222117	359383889	Heart of the West	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A magnificent epic!	I've had the hardcover edition of this book on my shelf since 1995 and just got around to reading it.  It's a sweeping epic roiling with all the drama and passion of the Old West.  As a writer, Penelope Williamson is in  a class all by herself.  Her evocative prose and brilliant  descriptions  paint an unforgettable portrait reminiscent of Larry McMurtry's LONESOME  DOVE, Gwen Bristow's frontier novels, or an all-grown-up Laura Ingalls  Wilder.	1998-12-13

I didn't know if the author could top her last  incredible read--A Place To Call Home--but this book absolutely won my  heart.  The &quot;bear&quot; scene alone was worth the price of the  hardcover.  I can't wait for Deb's next effort!	1998-10-09

It made me cry.  It made me sorry to see it end.  I could have  gone on reading about these characters forever.  I recommend it highly to  anyone who loves romance and to anyone who has never tried it before.  If  Morgan and Sabrina don't win you over, I don't know what will!	1998-10-07
