By means of a clever tale - charming on its own - this book explores primary colors, color mixtures, and contrast. It became one of my child's favorites as a toddler and remains a favorite at age four.  Longevity isn't the only milage we've gotten out of this book, either.  It has also spawned many spontaineous, artistic experiments with color (mixing paint or playdough, etc.).  For broad, lasting appeal and educational merit, this book is a great (bargain!) investment.	2002-10-02

The objects the doctor extracts from a young boy's dramatically bloated stomach get progressively more outrageous as they go along, and the story ends with a funny twist.  I'm delighted to find this 1966 Berkeley, CA classic available again in print.	2002-10-02

Those words are  inscribed on an introductory page to this book, and the idea is embodied on every page that follows.  In delightful, retro-modern styling reminiscent of the 1950's, a tale unfolds to delight the senses of any child (or child at heart!).  When Mom says Jimmy can't have his favorite snack (a Moon Pie and milk) before dinner, he sets off to get some on his own.  His adventure takes him to the moon and back, and lands him in his back yard just in time for dinner.  My four year old (and his parents) adored this book, and, of course, HAD to have some Moon Pies to go with it (which, by the way, are an actual pre-existing product available online through a webside provided in the acknowledgments of the book).  A more sensitive friend of mine was slightly put off by the belching scenes in the story, but we found those parts particularly inventive and humorous.  No imaginative 4-8 year-old's collection should be without this remarkable, endearing book.	2002-10-02

I waited on pins and needles to find out the gender of our expected child, and ordered this book for her the very day we learned she's a girl.  The book arrived today, and is every bit as beautiful as I hoped, if not more.  It covers every topic I want to record, including our anticipation of her arrival, her birth, family, health, first-year \\"firsts\\" and special events.  I was pleased with the amount of space provided for pictures, thoughts, and memorabilia (it even has a pocket on the back cover!), and delighted with the tidbits of plant and fairy \\"lore\\" sprinkled throughout the pages.  I was also surprised to find the book would have worked equally well had the baby been a boy; it seems like a lot of efforts were made to keep the book non-gender-specific, as well as completely adorable.  I would recommend it to any expectant family without hesitation.	2001-10-05

Unlike some books targeted toward younger audiences, it doesn't \\"talk down\\" to the reader-which can often produce a watered-down and sleepy result.  With an engaging, imaginative plot and language rich in flavor and tone, \\"Aunt Sally\\" spins a yarn that children and their parents can both enjoy \\"eavesdropping\\" into.  Parts of the book deal with less carefree issues, but they are presented with such warmth and humor that it makes the moral (kindness) an entirely un-adverse pill to swallow.  Don't expect the main focus of the plot to center around magical creatures, though.  This is a story about Family, and all the crazy things that make a family what it is.	2001-07-27

My child loved this book when it was first introduced it to him at 18 months; now he's nearly three and still asks for it, again and again.   The patterns of brief, rhymng phrase bites in this book are as appropriate for toddlers' short attention spans as they are for beginning readers' budding skills.  Soft, vibrant illustrations feature children from three ethnic backgrounds delighting in the vocal utterances of animals-human and otherwise.  Some sounds are predictable, others are surprising, but all have universal appeal and are presented in an irresistible, unforgettable way.	2001-07-03

The text bites and Eric Carle style illustrations do not seem particularly original or unique to me beyond that (though others might disagree: its was an American Library Association Notable Book and a Boston Globe Horn Book Honor Book in 1992), but it its still an enjoyable, good quality read for budding naturalists and youngsters who are curious about the world around them.	2001-07-03

Michael Hague's charming, earthy, watercolor illustrations lend a bit of folksy magic to this classic tale that all but transport a person to Oz itself.

Rich, detailed, charming illustrations accompany rhythmic, rhyming text in patterns that build upon each other, featuring all sorts of animals throughout the day and night, and even the sun, moon, and sky.  I loved the interesting and somewhat atypical choices of animals showcased (puffins, for example) as well as the more familiar ones.  The story progresses throughout one entire day, from moonlight to moonlight, making it an excellent choice as a bedtime read as well.  My pre-schooler and I have adored this book since he was 18 months old; it is sure to captivate aesthetics seekers of all ages-a timeless treasure, and a must have in every thoughtful literary collection for young people.	2001-07-03

If it were solely up to me, I'd rank it with one star less, but because of its enthusiastic reception by a member of its target audience, it graduates in my opinion from an \\"okay\\" book to a \\"good\\" one.  The format is simple: a small photograph shows how each item of food grows, a large one shows a close-up of the produce, and the name of the color it represents is written- in that color- in big, bold letters on the page.  There is one color/fruit or veggie featured per two-page spread.  The variations from traditional associations were interesting and perhaps potentially confusing (purple string beans, brown bell peppers), but I'll tell you what-my toddler remains pretty jazzed about shopping for-and trying out-all kind of fruits and vegetables now, as well as having had his color concepts reinforced.	2001-07-03

It is from this poem that the song, \\"Over in the Endangered Meadow\\" is taken, upon which this book is based.  Given that it is a counting poem, not only conservationalist ideals are presented, but a progression of numbers as well.  My two-year-old and I both enjoy the lush, rich, saturated illustrations that depict a variety of endangered species in their natural habitats.  Notes on the animals and what is endangering them, as well as the musical score, are included at the back.  <br />Since, in the book, the song is sung from the perspective of grandparents to their grandchildren, environmentally conscientious grandparents might want to add this book to their collection, or choose it as a gift for their young loved ones.  <br />Another fine nature/counting book inspired by \\"Over in the Meadow\\" is \\"Somewhere in the Ocean\\" by Jennifer Ward and T.J. Marsh.  We bought that book for our son following a trip to the aquarium nearly a year ago, and it continuities as one of our toddler's most requested favorites.	2001-06-29

It does not showcase the heroic acts of Robin and his merry band, or even focus primarily on his romance with Maid Marian.  Instead, Tomlinson chose to develop a thoughtful, imaginative, and carefully researched branch off from the original legend (thought to have taken place near her actual English home), in which a cast of capable females, who have traditionally filled supporting roles, set off on a progression of adventures of their own.  <br />Embodying a balance of compassion, courage, grace and true grit, these women work together, sharing their wisdom and strength, to win victories over oppression, illness, starvation, and the elements themselves, to heal others, and to heal themselves.  Robin Hood and his Merry Men play a part in the plot, but generally in a more contributing fashion, working alongside or in cooperation with the able heroines, sharing equal opportunities with the women to swoop in and save the day.  <br />In the tradition of Robin Hood, battle action and budding romances appear throughout its pages, but The Forestwife takes things one step further.  If you are looking for a book with strong, capable, problem-solving female leads, or a window of insight into the realities of day-to-day medieval life (as in The Moorchild, A Door in the Wall, or The Midwife's Apprentice), this book would be well worth a try.	2001-05-02

As usual, Taylor does a superb job of towing the line between reality and fantasy, lacing ordinary experiences with little hints of magic that seem so natural and believable that it makes you think twice.  Satomi Ichikawa's wistful sketches also provide a perfect compliment to the text.  This is a charming book for lovers of gardens or of fairy tales, for imaginative young adults, and for people of all ages who still want to believe in a bit of magic.	2001-05-02

I was first introduced to this book as part of a college course on literature for children, and instantly fell in love.  Rythmic verses of this rhyming text with fill-in-the-blank style pauses at the end of each stanza help early readers learn to read, young children squeal with glee, and everybody within ear shot get the urge to get up and dance!  In fact, a reading of this book has been produced on tape, with a wonderful latino-mambo background beat; it's also available in oversized format for reading in a group.	2001-04-19
