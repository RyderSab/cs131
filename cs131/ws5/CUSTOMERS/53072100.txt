Wright Mills' landmark book from 1956 posits that the major decisions in America are made by a unified \\"power elite\\" rather a multiplicity of competing groups or citizens. The \\"power elite\\" are the top leaders of the major economic, political, and military organizations - the President & cabinet, senators, top lawyers, CEOs, business moguls, bankers & financiers, admirals, and so on.  They tend to share a common outlook, privileged upbringing, and similar values. They also tend to be conservative, practical men with good judgment, rather than men of ideas.     These leaders move move easily between society's top command posts as economics, politics and the militiary become more interdependent. For example, Charles Wilson, president of General Motors, famously said, \\"What's good for the country is good for General Motors, and vice versa,\\" He eventually became the secretary of the Department of Defense. It's this kind of mobility, along with the shared outlook of leaders in top posts, that creates a single-minded military-industrial-political complex -- not some kind of intentional conspiracy.    The masses, in Mills' view, have little power and influence over decision-making.  They are passive spectators who take little independent action to directly influence policies, beyond voting occasionally. Furthermore, the elites can influence and manipulate the masses through public relations, propaganda, and irrational appeals via the mass media.     Overall, this book was clearly argued and well written. Then, as now, its thesis chafes against the spirit of egalitarianism, pluralism and democracy in America. Also, some might go on to argue that since this book was published in 1956, things have changed -- consider the civil rights movement or ERA, both of which weren't initiated by the elites. Yet parts of Mill's analysis have stood the test of time. Presidents and Senators still tend to be much richer than the average American. Corporate CEOs and Generals move into andout of government (consider Dick Cheney, Colin Powel).  Citizens & workers don't get to vote directly on whether to invade a country, or to close a factory.     Mills' book is certainly a famous one that every sociologist (armchair or otherwise) should read. So if you're interested in the structure of power in America, this book should be on your reading list.	2005-05-14

William Whyte, who was an editor at Fortune magazine, argues in this 1956 bestseller that some people not only worked for an organization, but sold their psyches to them as well.  These \\"organization men\\" willingly subordinated their personal goals and desires to conform to the demands of corporations and other organizations. This is different than modern-day workaholism -- the  \\"organization men\\" of the 1950's hoped to gain loyalty, security and \\"belongingness\\" in exchange. In their view, the organization is a friend, not a foe; it's should be co-operated with, not questioned.    Whyte argues that the ideology behind the organization man is a \\"social ethic.\\" Its core beliefs are that the group is superior to the individual, and individuals lack meaning and purpose outside of that group. \\"Belongingness\\" is assumed to be the ultimate emotional need of the individual, and to achieve it society should not hesitate to use a bit of social engineering. The result, however, is an ethos of over-conformity at any price.     As Whyte looked around the world in the mid-1950's, he saw the ethos of the Organization Man  everywhere. He saw it in college graduates who joined big corporations, pledging their loyalty with visions of a safe stable life in exchange. He saw it in corporate executives who willingly pulled up their roots every time the company wanted to transfer him.  He saw it when educators were asked to teach kids social skills so they could get along, rather than teaching academic subjects that forced kids to think for themselves.  He saw it in engineering companies that said  that there are \\"no geniuses here; just a bunch of average Americans working together\\" (although studies show that innovative engineers and scientists are fiercely independent, thus the direct antithesis of the company-oriented man).      So what to do? Whyte says we must realize that although we need the organization, we must know when and how to resist it. We must tread the fine line between self-interested cooperation and psychological surrender. We must realize that although the group can be a friend, it can also be a tyrant.       Even though this book was written about 50 years ago, many of Whyte's messages still ring true today. Yes, times have changed, and worker loyalty to corporations is passe'.  Yet this book is worth reading, if only for its historical perspective on the mood in the 1950's.  Also, it's well written - after all, Whyte was an editor at Fortune.  Recommended.	2005-05-11

Richard Hofstadter uses this telling quote and well as a wealth of other information to show how a thread of anti-intellectualism runs through the history and culture of \\"practical\\" America. He dissects anti-intellectualism, goes into its history and origins in the US, and shows its impact in education, politics, and business. This thorough analysis won him the 1964 Pulitzer Prize in Non-Fiction.  <br /> <br />Hofstadter is careful to define what he means by the intellect and intellectuals.  The intellect is the critical, creative, contemplative side of mind that examines, ponders, wonders, theorizes, criticizes, questions, imagines.  It is the province of writers, critics, skeptics, professors, scientists, editors, journalists, lawyers and clergymen. Just being a \\"mental technician\\" in these fields is not enough; one also acts as an active custodian of values like reason and justice and truth.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, America's practical culture has never embraced intellectuals. The intellectuals' education and expertise are viewed as a form of power or privilege. Intellectuals are seen as a small arrogant elite who are pretentious, conceited, snobbish. Geniuses' are described as eccentric, and their talents dismissed as mere cleverness. Their cultured view is seen as impractical, and their sophistication as ineffectual. Their emphasis on knowledge and education is viewed as subversive, and it threatens to produce social decadence.   <br /> <br />Instead, the anti-intellectuals believe that the plain sense of the common man is altogether adequate and superior to formal knowledge and expertise from schools.  The truths of the heart, experience, and old-fashioned principles of religion, character, instinct, and morality are more reliable guides to life than education. After all, we idolize the self-made man in America.  <br /> <br />Hofstadter goes on to cite examples of anti-intellectualism from the nations founding to today. For example, the founding fathers were sages, scientists, and men of cultivation, yet the Federalists attacked the brilliant Thomas Jefferson by portraying the curiosity of his active mind as too trivial and ridiculous for important affairs. Today, military ability is the kind of test of character which is viewed as good for political leadership, and voters view a show of intellect with suspicion.  <br /> <br />In business, commercial culture tends to breed acquisitiveness rather than inquisitiveness. Business often demands group cohesion instead of independent thought.  Hofstadter points this out using a number of examples. A Harvard Business School Dean said, \\"we don't want our students to pay any attention to anything that might raise questions about management or business policy in their minds.\\"  A famous chemical company's training film spouts, \\"no geniuses here; just a bunch of average Americans working together.\\"  The general point is that business is indifferent to knowledge on a broad scale; only the money-making faculty needs to be cultivated to succeed.  <br /> <br />Turning to education, Hofstadter points out that broad public education in the US was started not for developing the mind or the pride of learning for its own sake, but for its supposed political and economic benefits. Children were viewed not minds to be developed, but as citizens to be trained for a stable democracy. He goes on to outlines the debates within the community of educators about what should be taught, especially in previous eras when most people did not go to college. Hofstader also cites studies that show that even if students study \\"superfluous\\" intellectual subjects with no practical application, there ARE practical benefits; namely, learning any subject in depth teaches one how to learn something new. <br /> <br />Overall, this was a good analysis; the writing is very readable but not sprightly, and while somechapters are slightly slow going, others are fascinating. Overall, though, I thought Hofstadter's analysis has stood the test of time well, and it's easy to see how this book, over 40 years old, could be applied to analyze the world today. So if you're interested in a cogent analysis of anti-intellectualism, I'd recommend this book.  <br />	2005-05-10

In a dozen pithy chapters, he examines the \\"modern\\" world of 1958, and discusses the rise of huge organizations, the methods of modern propaganda, the role of the mass media, over-conformity, over-specialization, salesmanship & commercial society, brainwashing, and drug-induced happiness - all of which appeared in \\"Brave New World.\\" Overall, I found this to be a pithy, insightful, and prescient analysis of society. In fact, I thought it was as good or better than \\"Brave New World\\" itself.<br /><br />Here's a sampling of some points he covers:<br /><br />BNW depicted the non-violent manipulation of people through pleasures rather than violent oppression. In BNW, for example, the \\"system\\" creates people who are psychologically conditioned from birth to have the \\"correct\\" views on the world; the government sponsored drug use to keep people happy, and social interactions were ritualized and controlled. All this provided social stability.<br /><br />Huxley also writes that today's world has also become similarly over-organized, and people are manipulated by pleasures. We've created a vast commercial machine for the mass production of goods and entertainment. As cogs in the machine, people can become highly specialized automatons who subsume themselves into their organizations, making it's goals their own, suffocating their independent human spirit. Although highly productive & peaceful, Huxley claims the resulting social harmony is superficial, and doesn't fulfill us as human beings. People interact with each other from a distance, merely as workers or pleasure seekers, never as total personalities.<br /><br />Huxley's thoughts on propaganda also fill many of the chapters.  He shows that the large organizations of the modern world (governments, corporations, the military, political parties, churches, etc.) have all become very savvy in using propaganda to control \\"their\\" masses. As  Hitler knew, the masses hate reason; so his key is to create simple, repetitive, emotional appeals that spoke to them and appealed to their secret desires. Not coincidently, advertising uses this same formula;  find a common desire or widespread unconscious fear or anxiety, then relate it to the product you sell, then build verbal or pictorial bridge from their dream to your product, and repeat the ad over and over.<br /><br />So, what can we do to improve the world? Huxley offers few solutions, but one key point is that we must be aware of propaganda. To do so, we must learn the proper use of language, and learn how to dissect and critically analyze the messages aimed at us. Also, we should try to reconnect with our neighbors & communities fully as people, without intervening organizations. Finally, we should try to decentralize economic and political power as much as possible, since what is good for the economic or political \\"machine\\" isn't necessarily good for us as human beings.<br /><br />As I mentioned, this book was packed with insights, and a quick, enjoyable read. It's also a superb follow-up to Huxley's famous novel. Recommended., churches, etc.) have all become very savvy in using propaganda to control \\"their\\" masses.

His main thesis is that ideas about investing, economics, and markets are part of a larger body of  human knowledge, yet the pressures of the modern world tend to make us specialize in one field.  However, by searching out connections and parallels between markets/finance and ideas in diverse fields of knowledge, we can (hopefully!)  invest in a more insightful way.<br /><br />Hagstrom then takes us on a tour of physics, biology, social sciences, psychology, philosophy and literature. In approximately 20-page chapters, he presents some essentials in each field that apply to investing.<br /><br />Physics, for example, has long embraced the notion of equilibrium. Equilibrium also permeates finance; for example, supply and demand are equilibrated by the proper price. A key idea in biology is Darwinian natural selection. Hagstrom draws parallels between natural selection and the evolution of profitable trading strategies; unprofitable strategies die off in the process of competition.<br /><br />The social sciences also give us insights into how people behave in groups, whether as political parties, as investors, or as cultures. These fields show emergent behavior of groups of individuals, and that the behavior of the group is more than the sum of it's parts. In economies, Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" guides us towards the goal of properly rationing resources. Cities evolve distinct neighborhoods without any centralized planning. The stock market crashes occasionally as investors react to others reactions.<br /><br />Psychology is also an area of prime interest to investors, because emotion and cognition influence decision-making. The emerging field of behavioral finance has shown that the market tends to overreact to news, and that a contrarian investment strategy can be profitable. Indeed, investors can often attest to an internal struggle between fear of and greed. Unchecked, these can lead to gold rushes, internet mania, or stock market crashes.<br /><br />In the field of philosophy, Hagstrom focuses on the \\"pragmatism\\" movement in America, which believed that ideas are \\"true\\" if they have practical  value and provide some benefit to you, rather than conforming to some transcendent absolute \\"truth.\\"  Adopting a pragmatic point of view may allow a trader to more easily move to a new trading model or cut losses rather if a given model or position isn't working.<br /><br />Finally, Hagstrom discusses literature. He notes that literature not only stretches our imagination, but it can also teach us to read analytically, think critically, separate fact from opinion, and to discuss ideas with an open mind. This mental flexibility is crucial not only as investors in digesting news, but also as human beings.<br /><br />In many of these chapters, Hagstrom returns to the emerging science of complex adaptive systems, which provides a unifying theme.  Complex adaptive systems have a large number of individual units, and these units can be anything - ants, neurons, votors or investors.  These units change or adapt their behavior based on their interactions with other units as well as the overall system. These systems have self-organizing properties, and generate emergent behaviour beyond the behavior of individual units (i.e. cities `spontaneously' form distinct cultural neighborhoods without planning). These systems are constantly evolving and in flux, and occasionally go through periods of sudden change (like an avalanche, or stock market crash).  The common qualities of complex adaptive systems have implications for investors. The market will always be in flux, not in equilibrium, and it's more organic and emotional than mechanistic; as a result, it has small constantly changing inefficiencies that people compete to take advantage of.<br /><br />Overall, my one general criticism of the book is that one can see how these fields might apply to investing at a concept level, but of course \\"the devil is in the details.\\"  If you're an experienced investor, you will NOT read about how all this applies to the CAPM, or what you should do now with your 401(k).  But to be fair,  Hagstrom says in his preface that that's not his goal - it would be impossible in one book to flush out all the details.  That being said, I thought it was valuable how he described the interdisciplinary fields of \\"complex adaptive systems\\" and \\"behavioral finance\\" - these are indeed important new areas of research, ones that may reap benefits in the future. Without an  interdisciplinary view of finance, these promising fields would not have come into being.<br /><br />So in summary, I think this was a light, quick, enjoyable quick tour through the intellectual history of many fields. It was a valuable reminder to think outside of one's discipline to keep perspective and gain new insights. So if you want to think in a broader way about markets, then I'd recommend it.riticism of the book is that one can see how these fields might apply to investing at a concept level, but of course \\"the devil is in the details.\\"  If you're an experienced investor, you will NOT read about how all this applies to the CAPM, or what you should do now with your 401(k).

The author, a retired a Managing director at Merrill Lynch, focuses mainly on the corporate politics rather than the detailed content of the jobs themselves.  <br /> <br />The author touches on many areas, from how to get a job, how to navigate the corporate politics, and knowing when to leave.  To begin, he reviews the process of picking a job that fits your personality in sales, trading, research, or control/staff jobs.  He discusses how to survive the 3-5 years a new analyst/associate while doing the \\"grunt\\" work of preparing presentations, prospectuses, or trade tickets.  He discusses the demands (12 hr+  days), the toll on your personal life, and the high pay that compensates you for the risk of layoffs.  He also reviews the politics within the firm, and the natural tensions between producers & corporate staffers, investment bankers & research analysts, flow traders and \\"intellectual\\" traders, and between all departments at bonus time.  Helpful work tips are also emphasized, such as multitasking, punctuality, working foreign assignments, and how to build support within the firm to maximize your compensation at bonus time.  Through it all, despite the downsides that the author freely acknowledges, he believes that on balance jobs on Wall Street are worth it, because they have it all - intellectual stimulation, excitement, and great compensation.  <br /> <br />On the downside, I found the book's title a bit misleading - the focus of the book is on Investment banks, not on Wall Street as a whole. Granted, that covers a lot of `The Street,' but not all ( what about investment management? Credit rating agencies? Commercial banks? Hedge funds? Venture capital? These aren't covered.)    I think that if you want a broader view of the financial services industry, or details about specific firms, then there are other guides out there are better for that - such as the \\"WetFeet Insider Guides,\\"  \\"The Vault\\" Guides, as well as \\"The Fast Track\\" by Naficy.    But this book covers the corporate politics better than any of the guides I just mentioned. So if you're buying a few books to read up on how to succeed at Wall Street jobs, put this one on your list. <br /> <br />	2005-05-02

Are financial markets truly linked to the \\"real\\" world? Professor Mark Taylor, who has been praised as an \\"awe-inspiring theorist of everything,\\" explores these and related issues in this interdisciplinary book. Taylor attempts to show the links between economics, financial markets, money, postmodernism, complexity theory, media, art and religion. It's quite an audacious task, and although one might debate if he was successful, Taylor takes the reader on a thrilling intellectual journey.  <br /> <br />Taylor claims you can't study markets in isolation. Markets are embedded in society, so to fully understand them you must understand politics, culture, science, religion, sociology, and psychology. To do so, Taylor takes us on a tour of not only various academic fields, but also of places from Las Vegas to Times Square.  Stops on this tour support his thesis, which is that money and markets are essentially artful confidence games. <br /> <br />For example, he notes that in the 1987 movie \\"Wall Street,\\" the character Gordon Gekko says \\"Money...is transferred from one perception to another.\\"  Taylor then recounts how Wall Street fueled the public's perceptions of Internet stocks during the late 1990s stock bubble. Financial journalists, stock analysts, traders, advisors, and company officials all promoted fledgling Internet companies with skyrocketing stock prices.  Ambitious teenagers talked up the price of small stocks in Internet bulletin boards and then sold them at a profit. The NASDAQ market opened a glitzy new TV studio for business reports in the media saturated & neon-lit Times Square.  Using these examples, Taylor makes the point that the financial markets and the media are clearly intertwined, and that just some misplaced trust in them can bring financial markets through a boom & bust cycle.  <br /> <br />Taylor also discusses money and how it gets its value.  Prior to 1971, the value of the US dollar was backed by gold held by theUS Treasury. Generally, a gold standard prevents governments from arbitrarily running the presses to pay debts, which reduces the threat of inflation & boosts investor confidence. But what backs the value of gold? In short, only our collective confidence in it. Gold's value is not intrinsic to the metal; it's purely mental, and based on communal faith and trust. Because of that, going off the gold standard was difficult mental and emotional step for some in 1971.  <br /> <br />Taylor also discusses the sociologist Georg Simmel and his work on the philosophy of money. Simmel's view was that economic exchanges are a form of social interaction, albeit interactions that are turned into quantitative, rational, impersonal ones.  He thought that the flow of money shows the relationships between people. Thus, money derives its value from to what one can exchange for it in these social interactions, and its value is just socially constructed.  <br /> <br />Taylor goes on to discuss multiple views of the economy. He cites Friedrich Hayek's view that the economy is a vast, distributed, complex information processing system, in which prices are used as signals to coordinate peoples' actions. He also discusses modern complexity theory, which views the economy as a dynamic, complex, adaptive system, with self-organized emergent group behavior that transcends any individual person. In both these views, the economic \\"invisible hand\\" guides peoples' actions worldwide, and is seemingly omnipresent and omnipotent. This description, Taylor poignantly notes, is very similar to descriptions of God; in fact, Adam Smith's original view of the \\"invisible hand\\" was influenced by Calvinism and had God in mind. Thus, God is not dead as some have claimed; he has simply been reborn as the market.  <br /> <br />These are just a sampling of topics discussed. Overall, I thought the book had many thought-provoking ideas (& a few bad ones, honestly). It was rich in detail and well researched. But also I thought it could have been structured better to bring out the main points - it was easy to lose the main points amongst the thicket of details about Babbage, Bauhaus and the bond market.  Nevertheless, I thought the good outweighed the bad, so I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in viewing financial markets and the economy from a new perspective, that of a humanities professor and cultural critic. <br />	2005-04-07

The double meaning of \\"Just Work\\" shows us two possibilities. On one hand, our jobs might be \\"just work,\\" in the sense that we are only punching the clock in the jobs we find ourselves in. On the other hand, we might believe our work choices are \\"just,\\" in the sense that we've been able to freely choose fulfilling, satisfying, meaningful work which matches our talents, aptitudes and aspirations.      Is there any truth in either or both of these interpretations? How are they related?  Russell Muirhead, an associate professor of Government at Harvard, explores these issues in this book.  He argues that good \\"fit\\" is the best way to allocate society's work to people in a just way, and he makes a key distinction between \\"personal fit\\" and \\"social fit.\\"     Social fit is, in short, what society would like us to do. It's the match between our particular skills, talents, and education to the work that need to get done. But Muirhead argues that justice requires that the personal interests of individuals must count, too, not just the interests of society. Thus, we need to recognize \\"individual fit,\\" which is the work we feel \\"called\\" to do, work we find engaging, intrinsically interesting, expressive, fulfilling, satisfying, or an end in itself.     Problems arise when \\"personal fit\\" and \\"social fit\\" cannot be satisfied simultaneously. You may love reading and writing book reviews, but it pays little or nothing.   But you may be very good at law, but not think of yourself as \\"truly\\" a lawyer or feel excited by that role. But in a free society, people are permitted to seek a balance between the two types of fit, and that freedom of choice is just.       However, these free choices aren't necessarily optimal choices for individuals.  Some jobs have social prestige, glamour, money, and meaningful, interesting tasks. But some jobs simply do not, or cannot. Some jobs may be alienating, mindless, meaningless or conformist.  So we might freelychoose to work at a lucrative job, but find it doesn't engage all of who we are or our potential, and find it narrow and numbing. Or we might freely choose to pursue a satisfying but low-paying job, and yearn for better pay.    Overall, the book provided food for thought. It was readable and thorough, though not particularly lively. It is, of course, a book written by an academic, and there are all the necessary references to Plato, Aristotle, Marx, Mill, Rawls and Friedan.  Also, he focused on justice & fairness, with little emphasis on the economics of the job market, which I thought would have been another interesting point of view on these issues.  Nevertheless, Muirhead's argument about \\"fit\\" stands on its own.  The key distinction he makes between individual fit and personal fit is a good one, and it made the book worth reading.	2005-02-14

Mainly because I was intrigued & impressed by the sections devoted to the history of the utopian literature genre. Those sections, which gave a historical and literary context to More's work, made reading these notes very worthwhile.  Of course these notes also cover the standard topics you'd expect from the Cliff Notes series, such as the chapter-by-chapter summary of  \\"Utopia\\" and a biography of Sir Thomas More.  But I think the notes' broader survey of utopian ideals that makes them interesting.  They show us how the theme appears in everything from Plato's Republic to Gulliver's Travels to Russian Communism and elsewhere.  And of course, since they're Cliff notes, they're  a quick read.  <br /> <br />Two-thirds of the notes are devoted to analyzing More's book, which was first published in 1516.  More was the first to coin the term \\"utopia\\", which literally means nowhere. He describes a fictional society where people work 5 hour workdays, mostly in the trades. They relax with reading, lectures, and parlor games. They are under benevolent rule by carefully selected officials of superior intelligence and integrity. They use uniform, unpretentious clothing and housing, and dine in communal dining halls.   There is no money or private property; every man works for the good of the community, rather than just himself.  Each is free from anxieties, knowing he is rich in the sense he owns his share of everything.    <br /> <br />The notes go on to discuss how some have tried to bring utopian ideals to the real world. For example, the Fourierism movement 1830's and 1840's created many experimental communities in the US. These communities had emphasized joint labor, the communal raising of children, simplicity, uniformity of dress, pacifism, rigid codes of behavior, and rule by wise elders as officials. There's also a section in the notes on the relationship of Utopia to Communism; the two are of course similar, but definitely not identical.  <br /> <br />The notes also cover the anti-utopias described in 1984 and Brave New World. The  societies in both these novels are dysfunctional, though in different ways. In 1984, as you probably remember, the population is ruled by force - a totalitarian political party controls the masses through propaganda, surveillance cameras, secret police, and torture. There are historical parallels here to Stalinist Russia, or  WWII Germany.  In  contrast, Brave New World is about ruling the population through pleasures; universal happiness is provided through elaborate sports, entertainment, and ritualized social activities as well as happiness-inducing drugs.  Social stability is maintained through a class system created through selective artificial gestation & elaborate psychological conditioning so people accept their roles and get along with others.  Some say that the \\"Brave New World\\" reflects some features that are found in today's capitalistic societies.  <br /> <br />Overall, though, I thought the sections of these notes about the literary history of the Utopian theme, as well as the real-world examples of utopian communities, were even more interesting than the sections devoted to More's Utopia itself. If those themes seem interesting to you, then by all means pick up a copy of these notes & read the ~25 pages devoted to those topics. <br />	2005-01-29

In this book, he devotes individual chapters to analyzing the dysfunctional ways that capitalism impacts us as workers, consumers, investors, citizens and as human beings. In each chapter, he gives some suggestions about how we can leverage the many strengths of capitalism improve it from within.  <br /> <br />Although Greider *does* acknowledge that capitalism has improved our standard of living significantly and lengthened our lives, this acknowledgement is merely a nod; he definitely leans to the left in this book and suggest many interesting ideas for reform. Some of those ideas seem impractical, but he also gives many examples of how some are working successfully today. <br /> <br />Although he is well informed and a fluid writer, some of Greider's arguments and examples seemed one-sided, and this is one weakness of the book.  I had wished he could have anticipated obvious counter-arguments and refuted them, instead of leaving them lingering in the readers mind.  Nevertheless,  his ideas  will provide food for thought and an easy, enlightening read.  <br /> <br />Some of his main points are as follows.  In the chapter on consumerism, Greider notes that despite our material wealth, we're still consumed with the relentless pursuit of \\"more\\" - working more hours for more material goods, status goods, or entertainment. Furthermore, companies produce the products we demand in low-cost ways that degrade the environment. To counter this, Greider notes several examples about how organized consumer boycotts have changed corporate behavior more effectively than government regulation. <br /> <br />As workers, our fortunes are tied to the corporations we work for, yet we have little or no say in the big decisions. Democracy stops at the company's door.  Vast hierarchies of workers maintain the uneven distribution of money we see in the rest of a capitalistic society. Workers - or \\"human resources\\" -are rented by the hour, and those labor costs are often trimmed by reducing healthcare and pension coverage for employees. To fix this, Greider argues for and gives examples of firms with more participatory decision making, employee ownership, and executive accountability.   <br /> <br />In the chapter on capital, he notes that corporate investments are controlled by just a small group of executives, investment bankers, and large fund managers. Whether they are serving the stockholders, clients, or investors, this group makes decisions with a heavy emphasis on economic factors, and little or no emphasis on  larger social issues or goals. Yet the soft qualities that are hard to put a price on - like dignity, freedom,  a clean environment, democratic expression - aren't a byproduct of a strong economy; they are necessary for it, and the fact that they're \\"priceless does not mean worthless.\\" Thus, Greider believes that when the quest for profits and productivity trumps social responsibility, the economy will suffer. He'd encourage huge pension funds to invest for the long term in socially responsible companies, and cites those that do.  <br /> <br />In the chapter on government, Greider highlights the subsidies & other \\"corporate welfare\\" doled out by governments.  Large corporations on the verge of bankruptcy are rescued by the federal governement (think Chrysler, Savings & Loans, airlines, etc).  States compete to draw in new corporations by giving them special tax breaks. Rather than just occasionally intervening in the economy whose direction is set by corporations, Greider believes government should lead more via grand public works projects (Erie canal, the highway system, airports, parks, etc.) or through sweeping social programs (New Deal, etc.) Also, companies that are funded or rescued using tax dollars should spell out exactly what they will deliver to the public in return, or else their corporate charters must be amended to include a social mission.  <br /><br />In a final chapter, Greider notes that we should come up with a collective vision of what kind of society we want, one in which we are more than just consumers and workers striving individually; one in which we are citizens building the society we want. <br /> <br />Overall, I thought some of Greiders ideas were food for thought, some weren't, and some seemed well-intentioned but unworkable. Nevertheless, I found it enjoyable to read, since Greider is a fluid writer since he is a journalist. However, there are other books in a similar vein by economists that argue some of Greider's points slightly better --- in particular,  \\"The Future of Success\\" by Robert Reich on the work/spend cycle, or \\"The Affluent Society\\" by John Kenneth Galbraith on increasing government investment in infrastructure.   <br />	2005-01-23

Michael Watts, Professor of Economics at Purdue Univ., has pulled together 78 short excepts from classic and not-so-classic literature that involve economic topics. Those topics include money, unemployment, income inequality, division of labor, unions, supply and demand, cost-benefit analysis, property, scarcity and others.  The excerpts range from the classic (Shakespeare's \\"Merchant of Venice\\") to the modern (\\"The Perfect Storm\\" by Sebastian Junger). There's a wide spectrum of other authors, too, such as Emerson, Steinbeck, Dickens, Ben Franklin, Ayn Rand, Orwell, Vonnegut, Goethe, and others.    Some of the chapters reframe known works into an economic context - i.e. \\"The Road Not Taken\\" by Robert Frost is reframed as a lesson about opportunity cost. Other selections illuminate (and sometimes satirize!) some basic economic principles. In other excerpts, economic factors influence the characters and drive the plot forward.  In just a few others, the economic element is more tangential or incidental.    Overall, though, this is an interesting collection; I haven't seen anything else like it. It's a great reference book, and the sections & selections can be read indepenently. The collection is perfect for anyone who would like to push aside their supply-and-demand graphs or dry textbooks to instead read memorable stories about real people, stories that will also deepen one's understanding of economics. It's also great for anyone needing a gentle introduction to basic economic principles (though I should say that the book isn't a substitute for a more expository text in basic economics or finance).

At 1200+ pages, Wolfram's tome is chock full of big ideas, speculations, and a plethora of graphics, tables, charts, and diagrams; it is also written for the layman, though more scientific types will enjoy the material, of course. I too was eagerly waiting for the publication of his book, but as I finished it, I was somewhat let-down as I turned the last page.  There are some good ideas, lucid examples, and wonderful graphics; but the book is also shot through with sections that are rambling, speculative, wordy, repetitive, and vague. Overall, it's worth reading, but I wished it could have been trimmed down to 200 or 300 pages.  <br /> <br />One of Wolfram's solid main ideas is this:  Simple computational rules can generate complex, seemingly unpredictable random-looking behavior, and do so deterministically. The randomness in these systems is generated by the system itself (note: this is *unlike* chaos theory, where the uncertainty in a system results from the systems sensitive dependence on initial conditions which get amplified as time progresses). The behavior of these systems cannot be determined ahead of time (i.e. there are no closed-form solutions), so one must perform all the computations in order to see how the systems evolves over time.  <br /> <br />Wolfram then takes us on a wonderful tour of a wide variety of systems -- mostly focusing on cellular automata -- showing again and again how some simple rules yield complex behavior, and beyond a certain point, additional system complexity doesn't add much more complexity to the results. He then goes on to show how these findings might apply to a variety of natural phenomenon - fluid flow, snowflakes, mollusk shells, tiger's stripes. These are all plausible applications of his ideas, and the first chapters make for good reading.  <br /> <br />Moving into the second half of the book, a few negatives become more prominent. Wolfram tries to force-fit his ideas into all areas. He tries less convincingly (in my opinion) to apply his ideas to free will, entropy, space and time, gravity, evolution and other areas.   Also, his hubris shows through - from the almost complete lack of references to previous work except his own, to his frequent use of the pronoun \\"I\\", to his sweeping conclusions. For example, he says (on p. 726) that his theory \\"has vastly richer implications...than any single collection of laws in science\\" when talking about his \\"principle of computational equivalence.\\"   <br /> <br />Furthermore, while he makes strong claims in some areas, in others he prefaces his comments with \\"my guess\\" or \\"I suspect\\" and \\"my strong belief\\" which puts some of  his theses in the realm of speculation and intuitions rather than \\"a new kind of science\\" with a firmer foundation.  Finally, the fact that it's difficult to determine if some complex observed phenomenon is caused by the simple rules he describes OR by other more complex rules, seems to make this new science untestable -- and again makes some of his theses seem more speculative than scientific. <br /> <br />Overall, I found some of the ideas in the first half of the book about complexity arising from cellular automata and other simple systems to be very interesting and on solid ground. But taking that idea and stretching it too far in the course of 1200 pages made for a slightly trying read. Certainly the future of science will ultimately determine if Wolfram's ideas and speculations are significant, and worthy of five-stars. But overall, I'll give Wolfram's book 3 stars, since it didn't live up to the hype, though the first half was solid & interesting. <br />	2004-11-23

He describes several interesting problems in particle physics, and the exhilaration of working on them & with may famous physicists. However, since the field is extremely competitive & full of geniuses, tenure-track positions are few and difficult to get. Derman hops from one post-doc appointment to another over 6 years, but sadly decides to leave academia for Bell Labs. He worked at the labs for 5 years, until he was in his late 30's, and when Wall Street headhunters began calling.  Disappointed by the bureaucracy at Bell Labs, he then took a job on Wall Street at Goldman Sachs.  <br /> <br />Derman then describes the series of quant jobs he had at Goldman (as well as a short career detour for 2 years at Salomon Brothers).  In the process, he describes the exotic derivative instruments & theories he worked on. He touches on the technical details in a way that a motivated lay-person can understand. He also describes the cultures & corporate politics he encountered, as well as the differences and pressures of quants versus traders.  <br /> <br />Overall, I found it an interesting read. As one reviewer noted, this is the book every Wall St. quant wishes they could find the time to write. Derman is also a fluid writer, and his technical, philosophical, and autobiographical threads are adroitly interwoven. The technical issues are described so that even a lay-reader can understand quantos and binomial trees (by the same token true \\"quants\\" won't learn much new, at least in a technical sense).  However, if you're interested in the big ideas, thought processes, and career progression of a leading \\"quant,\\"  then thisbook is a must-read. Recommended.  <br />	2004-11-01
US	53072100	RBYSHJWYXB9MM	0139649581	348099011	Winning Office Politics: Dubrins Gd for 90s	Books	4	24	25	N	N	A Winning Playbook for Office Politics	Simply put, this was a very well-organized, comprehensive, straightforward though plainly-written book about corporate politics. If you want to avoid political blunders, outwit opponents, and survive career setbacks, then there are chapters for you here.  If you're ambitious, there are chapters on grabbing power and influence, as well as chapters about devious techniques that may be used against you and how to defend against them.  Yes, corporate politics can seem petty at times, but unfortunately it's a reality. And given increasingly competitive work environments, this book should have something for everyone, from powerless office minions to the most Machiavellian managers.  <br /> <br />On the plus side, the book is comprehensive, well structured, and makes a good reference. There are many sub-sections and very descriptive section headings, so you can easily find a section that applies to you. Also, you can absorb most of the main points by just by looking at the section headings. The supporting text is clearly written, and contains mostly examples.  <br /> <br />On the downside, the text itself isn't particularly lively - the prose is plain, factual, and straightforward, so while it's not difficult to read, it's slightly dry. Next, given the very strong outline and descriptive headings, you could skip the text & just read the headings and get just as much out of the book. So in retrospect, reading the entire book seems redundant. Also, if you've worked in corporate America a while, many of the suggestions aimed at novices will seem blindingly obvious (i.e. don't yell at your boss).  Also, a few of the supporting examples seem ludicrous -- for example, on p. 103, he recommends that if you want to impress coworkers at the office picnic, you should bring an extremely attractive person as a companion, \\"even if you have to rent one.\\"  This hired help then is supposed to flirt with your coworkers and flaunt their looks. Suggestions in this ilk are in the minority, though.   <br /> <br />If you're still not sold on this book, then here's some of the tips Dubrin goes delves into that may interest you:  <br />First, one should size up your boss, understand his/her objectives, get him/her on your side, be loyal & help him/her succeed. To grab power, he recommends that one should look powerful, network and form alliances & coalitions with powerful people, target getting key jobs and roles that control important corporate projects. To impress superiors, one should shine at meetings, be cool under pressure, be polite and loyal, and flatter your superiors without being too obsequious. <br /> <br />DuBrin also outlines how to avoid basic blunders such as bypassing your boss or yelling at him/her, being disloyal, complaining about an ex-boss or old employer, deviating too far from custom or organizational beliefs, dumping well-connected people and burning your bridges.  Instead, one should be a consistent performer, in control of ones emotions, appear committed to the job & your organization, be visible to upper management. One should also find a mentor, toot your own horn softly, take sensible career risks, work for a strong boss and help him/her succeed, and avoid weaker managers. Additionally, speak directly & honestly, stop malicious gossip and rumors, resolve conflicts early, and share credit, information, favors, gossip, and recognition. During career setbacks, one shouldn't panic, but should get support from others, sell yourself to people who can help you, and take action to plan your comeback.  <br /> <br />For the Machiavellians out there, there are chapters that outline devious tricks, such as backstabbing, double-crossing, discrediting your rival, stealing credit, exclude rivals from meetings or abolish their jobs or transferring them to \\"corporate Siberia,\\"  giving negative references, and giving self-serving advice. Dealing with difficult people also poses a challenge, and DuBrin's strategy is to leverage their weaknesses, taking over part of their jobs, and to give them negative but honest feedback either individually or with a group.  To defend against retaliation, he recommends exposing dirty tricks and confronting critics who bad-mouth you.  <br /> <br />Overall, I think this book would make a good reference for anyone working in an office. I think it can provide lots of tips for novices, and valuable reminders for corporate old-hands.  It's well-organized, comprehensive, and straightforward, despite a few negative points.

Although Friedman was somewhat repetitive and wordy, he made some good, insightful points. His uses analogies and anecdotes to liven up what could be an otherwise dull subject, though some are more helpful than others. He does have a pro-globalization bias, and does not provide specific solutions to the disadvantages of globalization that he touches on. Nevertheless, I thought the main points Friedman did make are worth reading, although I thought the book could have been trimmed a bit.  <br /> <br />The book centers on a few themes.  In summary, the world is growing increasingly interconnected, and this has accelerated after the fall of the Berlin wall.  With markets opening, trade barriers falling, and the spread of deregulation and free-market capitalism, we have created an increasingly interconnected global economic web. Companies, countries, and consumers can trade globally, find the best price, and move money anywhere in the world with a phone call or a click of a mouse.  Telecommunications, TV, and the internet spread information instantly.  The symbol Friedman uses of all this prosperity is the Lexus.  The \\"olive tree,\\" in contrast, represents the human cultural needs must not be trampled in the process of globalization, that is, the anchors of cultural and community identity that can easily be forgotten while \\"modernizing.\\"  <br /> <br />Although this global economic system promises rapid increases in the standard of living, it also forces both countries and companies to compete for capital. Democracies may vote every few years, but the global capital markets vote with every transaction, every hour of every day.  To attract foreign investors, governments must avoid war, maintain low inflation, balance their budgets, provide political stability, enforce strict banking & commercial laws, conform to international accounting standards, and have courts and officials free from corruption. Governments who deviate from these principles will see investors stampede away, interest rates rise, stock markets and currencies fall, and their dreams of prosperity fade.   <br /> <br />Besides capital flights, there are additional disadvantages. Capitalism results in unequal distributions of wealth, and creates much job churn and is thus socially disruptive. Some find it unfair, intense, dehumanizing, or just too hard.  To make globalization sustainable, Friedman emphasizes that countries must a provide social-safety net for people who can't keep up with the faster, more competitive economy, or who are temporarily displaced during the resulting economic churn. Additionally, one must take care to balance the Lexus vs. Olive tree, so that cultural diversity isn't wiped out in the process. <br />	2004-08-24
US	53072100	R2J2QAT2K2CSU7	0679642498	48597860	The Company: A Short History of a Revolutionary Idea (Modern Library Chronicles)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Superb, Pithy History of the Corporation	This short book was simply excellent.  The authors, who both work at \\"The Economist\\" fill this volume with a pithy, well researched, global history of the joint-stock corporation. They take us from early partnership agreements in 3000BC through the rise of big business in America, Britain, Germany and Japan, to the emergence of powerful multinationals. <br /> <br />The authors definitely have very slight, pro-corporation slant, but not annoyingly so.  They simply emphasize that corporations have improved productivity and lifted standards of living, and leave the many anti-corporate arguments to others.  But given that the corporation has risen to be a such a large influence in society, eclipsing states, politics, and church, understanding the history of the corporation may be important as knowing the history of our nation.  I found the topic interesting, and the book to be well researched, insightful, and well written.  Therefore, I recommend this book highly.  <br /> <br />The book covers a lot of ground, and below is a summary of some of the topics covered.  <br /> <br />The pre-history of the corporation begins with the Sumerians & the Assyrians, who negotiated contracts and had partnership agreements. The origins of more formal corporate law, however, can be traced back to the Romans.  By the 16th century, large corporations such as the East India company & Hudson Bay company existed; these were  monopolies chartered by royal governments to grab the riches of the new worlds opened by Columbus, Magellan, and Vasco da Gama.  In this era, few corporate charters were granted by governments. Furthermore, those corporations were restricted to the task they were chartered for.  Typically, these were for public projects such as canals, toll bridges, turnpikes.  <br /> <br />All that changed in the mid 1800's.  With the landmark Joint Stock Companies Act in 1856 in Britain, companies didn't have to be chartered by the state, but could incorporate simply by registering with the state. Corporations were free to do as they wished. They also were granted limited legal liability, so investors could be held liable for no more than their investment.  This landmark legal action was the start of the modern corporation. <br /> <br />Limited liability proved to be immensely attractive to investors, and some said it was the greatest single discovery of modern times. Indeed, it attracted a flood of capital to the first major corporations, such as the railroads.  The railroads were the first modern businesses; they required huge amounts of capital, and large armies of managers to administer an entire transportation network. The ability to sell shares allowed capital to be collected, and railroad shares this drove the growth of the NY Stock exchange.   Also during this period, large corporations began to merge, and/or to be held under an umbrella corporation using laws for \\"trusts.\\"   The monopolistic practices of these trusts, like Standard Oil Trust, led to modern anti-trust laws. <br /> <br />Corporations themselves began to evolve.  Improved management gave rise to \\"managerialism,\\" and the rise of loyal \\"company men\\" and professional managers. Business schools began to spread. The 1950's-60's was the heyday of the \\"company man,\\" who valued the traditions of stable office life, promises of a status tokens such as a better parking place or the gold watch upon retirement, and who would work hard to achieve them. Critics worried that they were \\"other directed\\" rather than \\"inner directed,\\" too worried about fitting in rather than following their own inner compass or entrepreneurial urges.   <br /> <br />Today, that corporate environment is gone.  In the 90's, the youthful entrepreneurial, meritocratic Silicon Valley held the country's attention, and tie-less entrepreneurs in start-up companies became our heros, not men in gray-flannel suits in blue-chip companies.  Companies slimmed down, focused on their \\"core competencies\\" and began to fight foreign competition, such as the Japanese.  Other companies grew to be huge  multi-nationals that spanned  borders.  By 2000, 37 of the top 100 economies of the world were corporations; in fact, Wal-Mart's profits were larger than the GDP of Peru. <br /> <br />The financing of modern business also played a key role in their history. Today, institutional investors, typically large pension funds, own over 60% of all public company shares. Their short-term focus drives a short term-focus for corporate performance.  In the 1980's, some companies tried to escaped this pressure and make enormous profits for their owner-managers by going private during the leveraged-buy-out craze. Years later, the technology boom and the strong stock market led to a heyday of \\"easy money\\" for public companies, which weakened checks and balances & corporate governance at those companies. Eventually, many managerial abuses and accounting fraud were found, such as those at Tyco, WorldCom and Enron. <br /> <br />Finally, the authors discuss a recurring question that comes up as they discuss corporate history:   \\"For whose benefit is the company run?  For stockholders only? For the workers? For society as a whole?\\"  One early argument was that since governments granted corporations the privilege of limited liability, that they had some obligation to the public.  Around 1900, the German corporate legal environment emphasized cooperation & a company's social role rather than competition. But in the US in 1916, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that a business works primarily for the profit of the stockholders. So despite the fact that protesters today cry for corporations to become more ethical, honest, humane, and socially responsible, corporations are legally mandated to make money for their shareholders as a primary goal. <br /> <br />This legal history is interesting, but unfortunately some legal history has been omitted; this is my one small criticism of the book.  There is some debate about corporate \\"personhood\\" that anti-corporate protestors often cite. In the eyes of the US legal system,  a corporation is a dis-embodied person, with associated rights, privileges, and obligations.  Corporate lawyers have often used the 14th amendment to protect corporate interests, and critics point out that this distorts it's intent, as it was originally directed at protecting the rights of former slaves. This entire topic not discussed in this book, though it's an important legal issue in the history of corporations. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, overall, I thought this book was enjoyable, informative, readable, and well researched.  I highly recommend it. <br />	2004-08-13
US	53072100	R3FDIXQHPNSI5T	0375420835	996900652	Status Anxiety	Books	4	188	192	N	N	A Salve for the Status Conscious	Alain de Botton (AdB) has written another book in his trademark witty, erudite style, kind of like a Woody Allen with a classical education.  This time, his topic is the quest for social status.  He probes the causes, and explores various prescriptions taken from philosophy, art, politics, religion, and bohemia to sooth our fears.  He uses historical examples, from Tocqueville to Tony Robbins, to help us keep perspective and to sooth our anxieties.   <br /> <br />I thought this was enjoyable summer reading, though not profound or complete by any means - although it was not meant to be. Also, some of AdB's other books are slightly better, so if this is the first book by AdB you want to read, I'd recommend \\"How Proust can Change your Life\\" first. But if the topic intrigues you, as it did me, then by all means give this book a try.  <br /> <br />A summary of the topics covered is below: <br /> <br />First, AdB begins by claiming that it's human nature that we want to be a \\"somebody\\" rather than a \\"nobody,\\" and to rise rather than fall or remain at too modest a rung on the social latter. This hunger for status can indeed drive us to achieve - but it also leads to a kind of restlessness characteristic of free, meritocratic societies. In contrast, there was no such anxiety in the Medieval caste system, because ones social status was fixed for life.  <br /> <br />One root cause of our anxiety, AdB claims, is that our egos are forever leaky balloons forever requiring helium of recognition and love, but always vulnerable to pinpricks.  The prescription: Don't take others evaluation too seriously - after all, \\"does an emerald become worse if it isn't praised?\\"   Also, remember that the views of the masses are often perforated with confusion and error, relying on intuition, emotion, and custom rather than rationality. As Voltaire says, \\"the earth swarms with people who are not worth talking to\\" <br /> <br />Also, one must realize that the determinants of high status continually shift.  For example, Spartans prized aggressive warriors; the Cubeo tribe in the Amazon prized those who killed jaguars.  In contrast, peaceful saints were idolized in Medieval Europe, as were \\"gentlemen\\" in industrial England.   Today, commercial success is our measuring stick - money signals success. But that definition also ties us to some new and unpredictable forces, such as our employer's success, flux in the global economy, and. technological change. <br /> <br />By using money as today's yardstick, we have sorely forgotten that cash and material goods are not the sole measure of a person's worth. In contrast, Bohemians, who devoted themselves to art and the intellect rather than material success, thought that those who achieved material success in society were those who pandered most effectively to the flawed values of their audiences.  AdB also quotes Montaigne to remind us that we must evaluate people through a different lens:  \\"A man may have a great suite of attendants, a beautiful palace, great influence, and a large income.  All that may surround him, but it is not *in* him...What sort of soul does he have?\\" <br /> <br />Another cause of our status anxiety is our own high expectations.  Wealth is relative to desire, and in an age of seemingly limitless expectations and material goods, we are weighed down by the limits of economics and reality, which yields permanent distress. We are also quietly influenced by our peers, advertising, and other outside forces that shape our desires rather than listening to our own souls. We also \\"mis-want\\" - that is, we think new products will make us happier than they actually will.  The prescription is that if we must continue to long for things, we must take care to long for the right things, and tune into our own true desires. <br /> <br />Finally, envy can be cured by realizing that anyone's achievements seem insignificant in the context of the millennia and the expansive wonders of nature.  Also, we should alwayskeep in mind that at the end of one's days, the value of  love, true friends, and charity will outweigh the quest for power, wealth, status and glory.  <br />	2004-08-09
US	53072100	RU11YAPNV876Z	0385479433	129609703	In Defense of Elitism	Books	4	13	16	N	N	A Call to Excellence	America's vital lie is egalitarianism, claims William A. Henry III, and with a &quot;rising tide of mediocrity&quot; what we need is to call to excellence, as well as the renewed confidence to say that some ideas, people and things are simply better than others. In other words, we need more elitism. In this well reasoned (though not rigorously argued) treatise, Henry's unflinching conservative opinions will no doubt infuriate some, especially as he applies his central thesis to multiculturalists, feminists, affirmative activists, and others. But he provides some thought provoking arguments that I thought made the book worth reading.  <br />  <br /> Henry begins by outlining his views of elitism, which he believes has been unfairly derided. He believes that at its core, elitism embraces excellence, not snobbery. Realizing that, we should reclaim the confidence needed to sort out, rank, and decide between competing ideas and values. Elitist societies uphold objective standards, embrace rationalism, and respect accomplishment. They also believe that competition brings out the best in people more than coddling does, and that people who make the most of themselves and contribute the most should be rewarded for their achievements.  <br />  <br /> Those ideas aren't pervasive today as Henry would like. Instead, many embrace the notion that \\"everyone is pretty much alike, that self-fulfillment is more important than objective achievement, that the common man is always right & needs no interpreters or guides for his thinking, and that society should succoring its losers rather than honoring and encouraging its winners to achieve more and therefore benefit everyone.\\" If we believe that everyone is equal, then success and failures are anomalies, and therefore luck determines our fate more than hard work, talent, intelligence, or initiative. Rugged individualism & self-reliance falls out of fashion, and is replaced by an \\"entitlement mentality.\\" Objectivity & rationalism are viewed as cultural artifacts, no more valid than intuition or other more primal ways of viewing the world. We believe that  <br /> \\"all of the children are above average,\\" much like in Garrison Keillor's fictional Lake Wobegon, despite that fact that our children's test scores are falling relative to children in other nations. <br />  <br /> Although the Declaration of Independence proclaims that \\"All men are created equal,\\" Henry believes it's been a grand folly to take that idea to the extreme, seeking not just equality in a legal sense, but also equality of outcomes in every field. People are not equal - some people are brilliant, some dim, some hearty, some handicapped, some slothful, some productive. And as a result, some of society's rewards are distributed unequally. But we don't know what to do with inherent inequalities in the egalitarian, democratic USA. We assume that \\"fair\\" competition would result in all groups sharing equally in society's rewards, and that any differences must be the result of an unfair system.  <br />  <br /> In the end, Henry's arguments are sound, and worth reading and considering. But this is by no means a balanced book, and that's why I didn't find his arguments more persuasive. He doesn't acknowledge the complexity of some of the issues he discusses, nor does he anticipate counter-arguments and refute them. For example, he believes in providing equal opportunity to pursue excellence, but ignores the historical (and sometimes legally sanctioned) lack of opportunity for women, blacks, immigrants, etc.  <br />  <br /> Society will always struggle with what to do with the successful, talented, or lucky versus the poor, short-changed, and unlucky. Ultimately, the extent to which we correct these discrepancies requires that we know how much of one's success is due to individual choices, and how much due to random chance, and how much due to society's help or hindrance. Separating these influences is a difficult if not impossible task, and thus the debate between egalitarianism and elitism will no doubt continue.  <br />	2004-08-07
US	53072100	R3LJ7UBHARVKUO	0312423136	149142118	Galatea 2.2	Books	3	4	5	N	N	A Novel Turing Test	In this novel, Richard Powers weaves an intriguing story out of ideas taken from Artificial Intelligence, neural network theory, the Turing test, Pygmalion stories, philosophy, brain-research, the state of literary criticism, and love of language. This was the first novel of his that I've read, and I was looking forward to it because I've read that Powers has a reputation for writing cerebral works that delight polymaths, using a style that would delight any highly verbal virtuoso. Unfortunately, I didn't think the book lived up to some of the reviews that called it &quot;dazzling,&quot; though I found it intriguing in parts. <br />  <br /> The novel has two major plotlines. First, a failed writer named (coincidentally) Richard Powers takes a temporary job as &quot;Humanist-in-Residence&quot; at a research institute. An AI researcher there takes him under his wing; later, that same researcher makes a bar-room bet with a colleague that he can write a computer program that would be able to comment on great works of literature with as much competence as an undergraduate English major. With the bet made, Powers is drawn into the project to train the program by reading literature to it. In doing so he learns its quirks, and muses about the nature consciousness as his dialogues with the program grow more elaborate and &quot;intelligent.&quot; Another separate plotline revolves around flashbacks Powers has to the years he lived in Holland with an ex-girlfriend.  <br />  <br /> One of the strengths of this novel is that Powers has clearly done his homework in the areas of AI and neural networks. He uses all the field's lingo correctly, and works all the right buzzwords into his literary pyrotechnics. Overall, I found the novel to be intelligent, erudite, and chock full of literary and technical references.  <br />  <br /> On the negative side, I thought the narrator's many flashbacks to his life with an ex-girlfriend in Holland could have been easily deleted; it didn't seemlike there was any strong thematic link between that plotline and the rest of the action in the novel. Also, the flashbacks seem annoyingly autobiographical (though we don't know how closely the narrator's life actually represents the authors real life). Finally, although Powers is capable of linguistic pyrotechnics, they can sometimes be distractingly ornate; after a while his verbal virtuosity doesn't rescue the slightly plodding pace of the plot.  <br />  <br /> Overall, though, I was entertained by his clever turns-of-phrase, the intriguing concepts and the narrators philosophical musings and debates. However, I kept thinking that the plot could have moved a little more quickly, and that something a little more surprising could have happened or there would be a slight twist to this theme. Overall, though, I think this would be a good novel from an unknown writer, however, it was slightly disappointing based on the reputation and history of the &quot;dazzling&quot; Richard Powers. Three stars. <br />  <br />	2004-07-23

And in this book of \\"comic sociology,\\" which is chock-full of wry, witty & entertaining descriptions of modern-day America and Americans, he explores these contrasts & our national character.<br />On one hand, the United States is the dominant force in the world on many fronts --- technologically, economically, militarily. Americans are restless, energetic, hard-working, religious, and readily change homes & careers while chasing opportunity. On the other hand, though, America's critics claim that we are materialistic, vapid, money-grubbing, shallow-souled, self-indulgent, vulgar, superficial, and blindly-optimistic. We have high marriage rates, but high divorce rates; high incomes but low saving;  we are productive but wasteful. We are a land of Bart Simpson, boob-jobs, Disney, and McDonalds. <br />How can we reconcile these two points of view? To do so, Brooks reframes our material longings, and claims that our baubles are surface products of a spiritual striving for perfection. Americans believe in the gospel of progress, in continuously improving ourselves, in manifesting our destiny, in improving  our lot, and in bending the world to fit our imaginations of a future nirvana. Americans don't solve problems - they leave them in the past, move to a new place, start a new job or company. Life is plastic - and we make out of it what we will in order to realize our potential.<br />Brooks then takes us on a tour to show how you can see signs of this striving in the people, stores, and the suburbs of America.  You can see it in the Uber-moms in the suburbs, former executives who pour their energy into perfect parenting, grooming their children for success by shuttling them to appropriate adult-supervised activities.  You see it in conscientious career-oriented college students more likely to climb the system, not buck it like college students of the 60's did.  You see it in the malls & in magazines, in imagesof perfect products. Those images arouse our secret aspirations to buy the right fashions, use the right diet, drive the right car, have the perfect lawn, and in the process transform ourselves from ugly caterpillars into a shimmering butterflies. <br />Brooks points out that America is a future-oriented, fantasy factory. Moreso than anywhere else, we live in a culture of dreams, plans, innovations, improvements, and grand visions of things to come or become.  Paradise is always just over the next ridge with the next home or job or credit-card purchase or spouse or SUV or beer or motivational seminar.  The cash register does ring, but it's just the gateway on the path to paradise, where material prosperity will be joined with virtue, understanding, and self-fulfillment. At least that's our secret hope.  <br />The downside of this view is that American restlessness never sleeps; there's always more improvement to be had, says Brooks. And in this relentless quest, we may forget the purpose of one's own life, use only money as a sign of accomplishment, remain discontented with our material success and still have a lingering desire for more achievement. Although some critics say Americans should slow down, Brooks says that's antithetical to the optimistic, climbing nature of American life.  Instead, he suggests Americans should connect their ascents to a larger mission beyond themselves, realized across generations or institutions. <br />Overall, I enjoyed this book. My only complaints are that Brooks leaves his most entertaining conclusions and arguments to the final chapters, and I think if he hinted at his points earlier on, it would have helped frame the points he makes in the first few chapters --- I felt those chapters wandered a bit while I was reading them. But after finishing the book, I thought his main points were clear, and the book was worthwhile. <br />Of course I could argue some of the points he makes, but right away he points out that this is a work of\\"comic sociology,\\" not a political or academic text. As such, I was entertained, even if I didn't share all his views.  In any case, if you enjoy his NY Times column or enjoyed his last book, then you should give this one a try.	2004-07-05

Regardless of whether you think Donald Trump as a symbol of American success, or you think he's an annoying, chest-pounding egomaniac with bad hair, this book will show you what it took for him to build up his empire.  The book shows Trump doing  what he does best -- boldly making big deals -- during the &quot;greed is good&quot; decade of the 1980's. I found it interesting to see how much of his current empire he had built up before his 40th birthday, and to understand how he pulled off various deals. <br />The majority of the book is a swashbuckling, detailed history of his biggest projects.  He talks about all the details, from negotiating with landholders, arguing about zoning with city officials, lining up contractors, interviewing architects, dealing with partners in various projects, negotiating with banks to line up financing, and the like. <br />Trump also devotes a couple chapters to his background. He was the son of a successful developer of rent-controlled &amp; low-income housing in Queens and Brooklyn, NY.  He was a mischievous, aggressive kid (he once punched a teacher), and was sent military school during his high-school years. He started college at Fordham in the Bronx, NY, to be close to home, but then then transferred to the Wharton Business School (at the University of Pennsylvania)  because he liked its entrepreneurial emphasis.  Shortly after college, he worked with his father to buy a troubled apartment complex in Cincinnati, which he fixed it up and sold for a multi-million dollar profit.  Hungry for bigger things, he moved to a small studio apartment in Manhattan, and progressed from small deals to bigger ones, from renovating a hotel, to building Trump tower, to building and buying casinos in Atlantic city, along with a many other projects. <br />Besides the stories of his deal-making, Trump gives some tips for aspiring moguls. Although he believes you need a certain innate instinct for negotiating well, he thinks there are some tips everyone can use. For example:  when planning deals, one should think big,  always have a plan B, keep your options open, and use your advantages as leverage in negotiations.  When executing a deal, one must deliver results, control costs, and fight competitors when necessary. Also, promotion of your project is important to get the word out.  And finally, of course, Trump says one has to have fun doing all this -- if it's not fun, why do it?  <br />Overall, the book was an OK read, and it moved quickly (I read it in about a day).  Some reviewers were put off by Trump's bravado (but give me a break -- it's Donald Trump!! what did you expect?).  If you can get past the bluster, you can see what it took to assemble his empire. I was inspired to re-read the book because of the success of  Trump's new TV show, &quot;The Apprentice,&quot; and I don't regret the day or so it took to re-read -- it's light reading &amp; moves very quickly.  If you'd like a quick refresher on Trump's rise, as I did, then this book (and some say the best book) should be on your reading list.	2004-03-09

The author (Taleb) has a PhD in finance, but also has traded in the pits, he knows both theory and practice and where they diverge. <br />Taleb focuses on hedging, which is a trader's main task when running a large portfolio of options.  Instead of using a flood of equations, Taleb relies on charts, graphs, and tables to make his points. Most of the equations &amp; heavy mathematics are relegated to the appendix, presumably because quants (or software) will price the instruments.  He covers the behavior of the Greeks (delta, gamma, vega, theta, etc.) for vanilla options as well as behavior of exotic options, and delves into the practicalities of volatility, hedging at discontinuities, and various other topics.  <br />The book is very popular on trading desks, and although I found it pretty good, I didn't find it to be outstanding.  Also, notably, the book does NOT cover credit &amp; interest rate derivatives at all; hopefully this will be corrected in the next edition.  <br />So if you need a book on the practicalities of hedging a portfolio of vanilla/exotic options, then get this book. On the other hand, if you want some basic options theory, or want to focus more in pricing, or need a basic introduction, look elsewhere (perhaps to Hull's or Wilmott's books).	2004-03-07
US	53072100	R3MOX1XMXQVBMD	0385508603	173053619	The Bug	Books	4	5	6	N	N	The Human Side of the Technology Equation	Ellen Ullman has once again written a book intertwining the technical, emotional, personal and professional  sides of  computer programmers' lives. In this book, which is her first novel, a programmer at a startup in the 1980's chases a flakey bug. That bug ultimately proves to be a maddening obsession for him, taking a toll on his professional and personal life.<br />On the plus side, this book was an easy read; Ullman is a fluid, entertaining writer, and can explain the technical details with a poet's perspective.  She realistically describes the typical life of a programmer -- the meetings, swarms of elusive bugs, demanding schedules, the thrills of working on cutting-edge projects, the quirky humor of programmers, and so on. Interspersed with the action are philosophical musings about computer technology, \\"real\\" life, and the parallels between the two. Furthermore, as she did so well in \\"Close to the Machine,\\" Ullman is able to describe the supremely logical world of software development and draw us into it to make us sense and understand the source of programmer's excitement and frustration.  Like Ullman herself, the novel's narrator was not a computer programmer at first, but drifted into it. The result is a fresh, lively, fluid description of computer technology that a pure, \\"hard-core\\" techie probably couldn't capture. <br />On the minus side, the novel had just a few drawbacks. First, the ultimate outcome for the main character was slightly disappointing for me (I won't reveal the conclusion here, though I will say I could think of a slightly better ending).  Second, others have complained that the bug turned out to be too simple once it was found; however, I think that the complexity (or lack thereof) of the bug is besides the point of the novel, since its elusive nature is what drives the novel and characters forward. Third, Ullman tries to make the novel have two main characters -- Roberta, a software tester whose narration dominates the beginning and end of the novel, and Ethan, the programmer whose actions dominate the middle of the novel. The shifts between these two voices are mildly disorienting, and having a single character narrating the entire story would have been slightly better. <br />Overall, though, I believe the plusses outweigh the minuses, and I'd recommend this novel to any budding computer programmer, or anyone interested in software or technology.  If you enjoyed other books in this vein -- \\"The Soul of a New Machine\\" or \\"Microserfs\\" or Ullman's previous book, \\"Close to the Machine\\" -- then you'll enjoy this one. Despite the technical subject matter, this novel is ultimately more about the characters than it is about the technology, so I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in the human side of the technology equation.	2004-02-01

Karl Iagnemma's distinctive characters - a  failed engineer, a phrenologist, a mathematician, an amateur geometrician, a forester, a doctor, and others - all muddle through the familiar scientific terrain of conferences, scientific journals, equations and experiments, which serve as a perfect counterpoint to the messy relationships and longings in each of their lives.<br />Iangemma is perfectly qualified for writing stories using these themes; he works as a robotics researcher at MIT by day, and writes short-stories after-hours. His writing talents have been praised and published in prestigious literary journals. Nevertheless, his writing shows that he is clearly part techie.  For an engineer like myself, it's refreshing to read someone who knows the science/technological mindset from the inside, and weaves touches of that sensibility into fine set of well-told stories. <br />However, make no mistake - this isn't science fiction - it's fiction about scientists. For example, in the title story (my personal favorite) the narrator, a &quot;failed engineer,&quot; describes the Venn diagrams and coupled sets of differential equations he's created in attempts to describe his love for his girlfriend.  Another favorite story of mine, &quot;Children of Hunger&quot; hasn't been mentioned often in reviews here; in it, a medical researcher in a stale marriage asks his lonely wife to make a key sacrifice to further his research, leading to an ending with a clever twist. <br />Overall, the stories tilt slightly towards the illuminating the human heart rather than exalting the scientific mind. Nevertheless, Iagnemma's characters do discover something -- the emotional texture of their lives outside the lab, and Iagnemma tells their stories in a way few others have. Recommended.	2004-01-11

As you probably already know, it's a novel narrated by an autistic teenage boy. The choice of point of view here is wonderful, and I found it refreshing to be drawn into his mind, which is supremely logical and literal, and to see how he dealt with messy human relationships, emotional situations and the chaotic world. Even though I have only rudimentary knowledge of autism, I think the story helped me undertand it slightly better after experiencing the \\"inner life\\" of the autistic narrator for 200 pages or so. Overall, this was a short, entertaining, insightful light read, which moved along quickly (I finished it about a day).  I highly recommend it.	2004-01-07

Some reviewers said that the book is &quot;slow-moving,&quot; though I think the of the novel as more of an atmospheric portrait of GK's character, &quot;Gary&quot; and of  his town, the fictional Lake Wobegon. <br />Even though several scenes &amp; charactors were entertaining, I thought some others lacked entertainment value &amp; could have been cut --- for example, at one point 14-year-old &quot;Gary&quot; writes short stories involving boogers and constipation. Now, I admit that it's realistic for a 14 year old to do, however, as a reader, I didn't find it compelling or entertaining. Also, the &quot;shotgun&quot; wedding at the end of the novel wasn't a really positive way to end the novel, either. <br />Overall,  I think GK paints a good portrait of his fictional character Gary, and of his life in Lake Wobegon.  Despite this, the book didn't keep me turning the pages enthusiastically, and I probably could have skipped it.  However, I'm not partial to any of GK's novels (I prefer his radio program &amp; short stories), so if you're a die-hard fan of the other Lake Wobegon books, then you might want to give this one a try.	2003-12-30
US	53072100	R2VICEX6FGMMY6	0071346864	731826902	Equity Management:  Quantitative Analysis for Stock Selection	Books	3	6	6	N	N	One good chapter, but slightly repetitive &amp; not much new	Jacobs and Levy have assembled a body of work here centering on their stock picking techniques as well as their long-short portfolio construction techniques. Most of the chapters have their origins in various finance journals, though the articles themselves are not very heavy on mathematics.   Overall, the book was interesting, though somewhat repititious. In retrospect I'd suggest that those familiar with long-short portfolios and the various market anomolies should just read chapter 2 about &quot;Disentangling Equity Return Regularities&quot; since that is where Jacobs &amp; Levy's original work is outlined. <br />Chapter 2 focuses on the use of regression analysis to &quot;disentangle&quot; various stock market anomalies. The authors claim that simple rules such as &quot;Buy low-P/E stocks&quot; are appealing, but oversimplify the true source of stock returns. For example, low P/E stocks tend to have higher rates of return, as do small-capitalization stocks. But if a small capitalization stocks also tend to have low P/E's, then how much of their return is due to the low-P/E effect by itself, and how much is due to the small-capitalization effect by itself?  Jacobs &amp; Levy have done the analyses, and show which effects are genuine, and which effects are merely proxies for other effects. The effects that turn out to be the strongest when &quot;disentangled&quot;  include low P/E, Earnings trend, Earnings Surprise, Residual Reversal, and Relative Strength. <br />The introductory chapters in the book make some interesting points. They argue that the stock market is not random, but then again it is also not simple. Although simple rules are appealing to humans, they oversimplify the complexity of the market. To gain an edge, one must use sophisticated, objective, multi-factor statistical computer models that capture the complex interactions in the market. Of course the authors are saying this to advocate the techniques they use, but nevertheless, they have some good points.<br />Finally, the second half of the book focuses on the construction of long-short portfolios, though there is not much fresh material here. They point out some of the logistical details of running a long-short portfolio, and give some examples. Also, they introduce the concept of &quot;alpha-transport.&quot; That is, one can construct a long-short market neutral portfolio, then by buying buy an index (using SP500 futures, for example) one &quot;transports&quot; the gains from the long-short portfolio onto the gains/losses of the index position. Thus, if the stock picking for the long-short portfolio is done correctly, the total portfolio will beat the index picked.  To me, this seemed like an obvious technique; I'm surprised they decided to focus on it and give it a fancy name (&quot;alpha transport&quot;) <br />Overall, I found the book interesting, though somewhat repetitious. I was familiar with much of what was covered, however I did find that Chapter 2 was worth reading, since I wasn't familiar with Jacobs &amp; Levy's work in detail.	2003-10-09

Families each have their own unique culture which creates an emotional environment that children learn from &amp; absorb. People growing up in healthy families become mature healthy people, who have their own identity &amp; have a healthy separation from their family; they have learned that they are free to feel what they feel and express it even if it goes against the family \\"script,\\" roles, or views.  If there are disagreements, then people fight fairly, with nobody is trying to manipulate each other or use each other to satisfy unmet emotional needs.<br />Bradshaw then looks at the dynamics in dysfunctional families. He examines, in turn, families with alcoholics, families who are physically or emotionally abusive, and those that are co-dependent. These families may have problems with enmeshment, guilt, control, shame, family secrets, continuous fighting or no fighting because \\"wrong\\" emotions are forbidden. He highlights the fact that dysfunctional families often have dysfunctional kids, who then seek out, find, and marry other dysfunctional people (since they act in a familiar, though dysfunctional, way). In this way, certain family problems such as alcoholism, violence, and so on can be handed down across generations. Because of this, one should examine one's problems in the context of one's family, and always look for the \\"problem behind the problem\\" (i.e. ask what drives one to drink? Rather than just address alcoholism as an addiction).    Bradshaw goes on to give a 12-step plan for recovery to escape this pattern. The 12-step program he outlines mimics the one that Alcoholics Anonymous uses (Bradshaw is himself a recovering alcoholic). <br />Overall, I found the book to have several pluses and minuses. On the plus side, I thoroughly enjoyed the first third of the book, which laid out the main idea that the family must be understood as a system. The rest of the book amplifies and repeats the ideas in the first third, then goes into detail about the dynamics in various dysfunctional families &amp; recovery. These details seemed to be somewhat similar, redundant, and somewhat obvious, though they will probably resonate with those stuck in those particular situations.  Next, one slightly annoying technique that Bradshaw uses is that he often spells out a phrase, then use each letter in that phrase to write a paragraph about a related idea (for example, F.A.M.I.L.Y =&gt; F=Feedback loops are important...; A=Autonomy is key...; M=Marriage is a chief Component of families....etc.). Also, Bradshaw seems to emphasize that \\"shame\\" is the root cause of almost every problem he describes; I thought that this oversimplifies the issues involved.  Finally, the book seems (and is, I suppose) geared towards a mass audience, so it's not a deep psychological text and at times it seems to have some &quot;pop psychology&quot; elements. But as I said before, I thought the first third of the book was good &amp; worth reading, since it covers the main ideas. The rest of the book, about recovery &amp; specific situations of abuse, can be skimmed or read in depth if one particular family situation applies to you.	2003-09-23
US	53072100	R27NT4K1AHIPHL	0395925002	68785412	The Affluent Society	Books	4	82	93	N	N	Thought Provoking, Well Written Leftist  Economics	Galbraith's book is certainly thought-provoking &amp; worth reading. His arguments are well thought out, and his writing is wryly witty. Even if you disagree with his views, as many have, it's worth a read. <br />Galbraith starts the book off by reviewing how many early economic ideas were created in periods of scarcity, and that the notion of  scarcity may  not appropriate for today's age of mass affluence.  Those with vested interests in production (i.e. large businesses) still cling to the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; that increased production equals progress, even though goods are now abundant and our basic material needs have been satisfied. To stimulate further demand, corporations must resort to salesmanship and advertising. If advertising stopped, demand would fall, production would drop, and unemployment would rise; thus, business continue to focus on increasing production to ensure their own survival. <br />There are other threats to production. Economic cycles may result in a depression.  Poorly managed firms may have to lay off workers. As a result, people -- and especially politicians --focus on economic growth to avoid these insecurities. Growth is something that both the rich and poor will vote for, since they both want to keep their jobs and acquire more goods. Growing out of a recession also seems promising.  The net result is that society as a whole focuses on increasing production by private industry. <br />Next, Galbraith shifts his view from private industry to the public sector. He does this by introducing  the idea of social balance, which asserts that as private spending increases, public spending should increase to match. For example, if factories build more cars, more money needs to be invested in public roads. Unfortunately, private goods are sold via advertising by companies that can react quickly to changes in demand. In contrast, public investment by governments reacts much more slowly, and typically lags private spending and investment, due to regulations, bureaucracy,  and voter's general aversion to new taxes.  The result is a world rich in private goods but poor in public ones: beautiful cars driving on poor roads, well-dressed kids in the crumbling public school, neighborhoods with beautiful homes but polluted parks.<br />So what to do? Galbraith's proposed solution is that we should invest in our economic infrastructure: our parks, our roads, our educational system, long-term scientific research, police, and the like. To fund this, he emphasizes sales taxes, which reduce consumption, and make those who consume a lot pay for it.  To alleviate poverty and inequality, Galbraith also proposes to expand unemployment insurance so that one could choose not to work, yet still be able to get by.  In his view, this would allow more people to reduce their work week, or not work at all, or to be able to focus on work they really enjoy. <br />Although this is certainly a liberal view &amp; may not be feasible, his views certainly were eye-opening and thought provoking. For that reason, I recommend the book.	2003-09-18

In an unbiased manner, Jonathan Wolff reviews the central ideas that are fundamental to the field: the state of nature, how one justifies the formation of the state, how to pick rulers, liberty, distribution of property, individualism, justice, rights, democracy, utilitarianism, and social contracts. He also reviews ideas of the major thinkers -- Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, etc.  The book is organized by TOPIC, not by thinker, which is a format that I find was best suited for learning &amp; for tying different thinker's ideas together. The writing is clear, simple, and chatty; it seems to have been written for college freshman. The only minor fault is that the book does not cover some major figures in political theory that I would have included: Aristotle &amp; Machiavelli were not mentioned, for example.  However, overall, I'd recommend this book. I'm keeping it on my bookself for reference.	2003-08-20

I'm sure many of you did, too. I reread it recently, and I'm convinced that this is one of those books that one should reread when one is a bit older. Orwell's fable of farm animals' revolution sold out by their pig leaders is simultaneously short, fun, shocking, and engaging. It's also pithy and wonderfully written. Plotwise, you just have to crack a wry smile at the historical parallels that Orwell creates when his characters begin spouting their Marxist philosophies and begin to plot a revolution. Other plot points & themes are timeless -- the supply shortages, summary executions, propaganda, political assassinations, and single-candidate elections in \\"Animal Farm\\" can be seen in many dictatorships, from Stalin's to Saddam's. Overall, I highly recommend rereading this book, especially if you were a teenager the last time you read it.	2003-08-12

It's a good commentary on the modern world. Also, I think  DeLillo writes well, and his insights were thought provoking. There are many great snippets which deserve to be underlined and reread (or read aloud, as some have said). But if  you want a good plot & well developed characters, you won't find it here. It's good, I don't think it's one of the best books of the 20th century, as some critics have claimed. <br />The book has three main plot points. Jack Gladney is a professor at a small liberal arts college. He specializes in the academic study of Hitler. The first third of the story is somewhat slow, but in it Jack begins to wonder, \\"Who will die first?\\" -- him, or his wife? He also has several witty conversations with  his academic colleagues, his wife, and his children.  The second third of the story is devoted to a chemical spill that releases a large, black, toxic cloud of gas, and this forces Jack and his family to evacuate town.   Eventually, they return home. Moving into the last third of the book, Jack learns his wife is taking an experimental drug to control her fear of death, a fear that Jack shares. Finally, without giving away the ending, finds consolation about his fears of death talking to semi-atheistic nuns in a hospital.<br />As I see it, there are two major themes running through \\"White Noise.\\"  The first is fear of death, and the second is a satire of the commercial culture we live in. <br />A fascination with and fear of death is woven into many of the aspects of the story.  For example, in the start of the book Jack wonders who will die first -- him, or his wife. More tellingly,  Jack made his academic career on academic studies of Hitler, a mass murderer. He also converses with academic colleagues who find cultural significance in the large number car crashes in movies. The deadly, toxic, chemical cloud released in his town is huge, ominous and black, and follows them as the wind shifts. Finally, Jack'swife takes an experimental drug to control her fear of death. <br />The second major aspect of the story is DeLillo's running cultural commentary on many subjects, but mostly on commercial/media culture and modern living.  For example, in many scenes there are TV's or radios turn on, constantly interjecting random words, thoughts, jingles, and ideas.  One of Jack's academic colleagues revels in TV's message, in the slice-of-life commercials, in product jingles & mantras; he also wants to make a career out of studying Elvis.  In another scene,  Jack sees his sleeping daughter murmuring quietly -- he leans in to listen, to realize that is young one murmuring, \\"Toyota Celica.\\"   Those reassuring words are part of the subconscious static of kids' minds, he muses. Scenes like this are typical of DeLillo's commentary on commercial culture, and there are too many other scenes to list here. <br />Overall, DeLillo's observations are sharp, witty, satiric, insightful and fun to read.  The downside of this is that  DeLillo's  commentary seems to take over the novel at times. All characters seem to speak in the same voice, the voice of a wisecracking cultural critic.   Also, the novel isn't plot driven; the characters move through events that give DeLillo opportunity to make his comments on death & commercial culture. Jack Gladney's character is the only one with any internal dialogue; the other characters are merely clever props.<br />Overall, the book is worth reading. It's a good commentary on the modern world. Also, I think  DeLillo writes well, and his insights were thought provoking. But if  you want a good plot & well developed characters, you won't find it here.	2003-08-07

Although I think Conniff, on balance, focuses more on the rich than on the parallels between the animal kingdom and the richs' behavior, this isn't a big flaw, at least to me -- I'd rather know a little more about billionaires' lives than a little more about the sex lives of the bonobos. Overall, I'd recommend this book. <br />Throughout the book, Conniff traces the behaviour of the rich and of various animal species, he shows that territoriality, social hierarchy, pecking orders, and competition for mates aren't just confined to the animal kingdom. Indeed, the natural laws of power and association are two major areas we have in common with our animal brethren.<br />He notes that the rich, as well as animals, know that power, control of resources and social dominance is what it's all about, despite any of their claims to the contrary. One must be confident, have good posture, walk straight, look people right in the eye, go directly after what one wants, and remember it's all about winning-winning-winning. The richs' influential friends, big houses, glamorous hobbies are all signs of dominance, as is a single-minded determination to impose one's vision on the world.<br />Conniff also points out that the softer side of domination is that of association. The rich know that \\"you are who you know.\\"  One must make friends shrewdly, cultivate allies, go to the right schools, live in the right neighborhoods, give to socially desirable charities, throw parties and invite all the right people. For humans, social intelligence is as important for survival as navigational skills are for arctic turns. Knowing the right people, places, pleasures - the sorts of things a rich person should know - is the only reliable badge of admission among the rich. And realize that the rich aren't out to impress the masses - the rich want to impress other rich people, not those far down the pecking order. Wanting to impress the masses is like a peacock wanting to impress a dog.<br />Finally, Conniff explores the age old question, \\"Is the world inhabited by the rich different?\\"  Of course there are more comforts; the rich enjoy what the world has to offer, and family dynasties give heirs a sense of continuity and tradition. But the downside is that although wealth might not change you, it most surely changes the way people treat you. The rich are used to people sucking up to them, and expect but are suspicious of being flattered by their servants, friends, and potential allies. Also, the rich tend to socialize amongst themselves, and experience a sort of social isolation, going to the same restaurants, vacationing in the same spots, dating other \\"suitable\\" rich people, intermarrying amongst themselves.  Through all these behaviors, they slowly dissolve anything they have in common with most other people, so being rich can be lonely. They live as birds in gilded cages.<br />Overall, this was a good light read. Recommended.	2003-06-19

It is very plot-driven, and as the novel unfolds you just have to smile at Barry's wry and dystopian view of the future. Privatized governments, frequent flyer programs causing major corporations to form two competing \\"teams\\" at war with one another, bar-code tatoos, and other details make the book a clever satire of what Barry calls \\"capitalizm.\\" <br />The book itself is organized in very short chapters (2-5 pages each, typically) and Max Barry's prose is a bit plain, but it gets the job done. As I said, the book is very plot-driven, and it moves quickly. The book will be easily adapted to become a big-time blockbuster movie, if it ever comes to that  -- it's filled with the requisite shoot-outs,  superficial dialogue, an cliche'd characters. But it's all in good fun.  Overall, I'd recommend the book as a light summer read. I polished it off on a long plane ride, and it made the trip pass quickly & enjoyably.	2003-06-04

The book is, in essence, a long, witty personal essay about snobbery in America.  As some other reviewers below have noted, it's slightly redundant, and it seems like it could have been trimmed down a bit to make a pithy 50 page article. But Epstein's tour though snobbery was enjoyable. <br />The book has three main parts. First, Epstein reviews definitions of snobbery, considers how it has changed over  time, and then he delves into the various areas that are used by snobs today as bases of status.  What follows  is a summary of the book's main points: <br />The essence of snobbery is that you want to impress people, to make yourself feel superior at the expense of other people. The dictionary definition is one with an  &quot;exaggerated respect for social position or wealth, and a disposition to be ashamed of socially inferior connections; behaves with servility to social superiors, and judges merit by externals; person despising those whose attainments or tastes he considers inferior to his own.&quot;  Snobs live in a world of relentless one-upmanship; his only standard is one of comparison, competition, and rivalry.  The snob is always positioning himself, trying to gain ground on his superiors, distancing his perceived inferiors.  A snobs high standards are tools used in an attempt to impress others, rather than as ends in themselves. Snobs respect the trappings of status: social class, money, style, taste, fashion, attainments, prestige, power, glamorous careers &amp;  possessions, memberships in exclusive clubs and groups, name-dropping, celebrities, socially favorable marriages. <br />Ironically, however, the snob's quest for status leaves him powerless, for status is not in the possession of it's holder, but in the eyes of the beholder; you cannot convey status on yourself, others must do that. Snobs hope that others will take him at his own extravagant self-valuation; he needs confirmation, acceptance, and fears rejection. For snobs, the wrong opinion, family, schools, connections, clothes, taste, or manners is more than stupid - it's a disqualification.<br />Epstein also asserts that the basis of snobbery has changed over the last century.  The old WASP-ocracy, with its emphasis on lineage, Ivy League schools, exclusive neighborhoods and work at law &amp; Wall St firms, has declined for a variety of reasons.  In its place, Epstein asserts, the emphasis on taste, style, and being &quot;with it&quot; has increased. Consumption patterns began to replace social class as an organizing principle of society. Taste -- in politics, food, clothes, culture, opinions -- betrays social class, personal aspirations, self-conceptions.  These are the remaining grounds for snobbery today. <br />Finally, why does snobbery persist?  Snobbery thrives in democracies, in fact, because social mobility allows one to rise, as well as fall.  The quest to rise and do better than one's parents is a central part of American culture, and the societal hope is that quest for prestige will drive people to higher levels of achievement.  Fear of falling, as well, drives many to snobbery. Until we reach  the day when society is fair, kind an generous, and nobody needs reassurance of their worth, then snobbery will exist.  Epstein also reminds us, however, that status is a side dish of life, not the main course, and that the best way to gain prestige in a snobbish world not to care about it at all.	2003-05-06

The chapters review bond math, statistics, derivatives, fixed income, equities, currencies, and risk management. The book focuses exclusively on finance, and not on the structure of the financial industry, typical jobs, or interview skills. However, this isn't a drawback -- there are other Vault guides that cover these areas.<br />Overall, the book is certainly more technical & mathematical than most interview guides (except perhaps for \\"Heard on the Street\\" by Tim Crack at MIT), so be prepared to review the Black-Scholes partial differential equation. Despite the complexity of the subject matter, the author's explanations make the material accessible, and her explanations were pithy, clear, and often accompanied by helpful diagrams.  My only complaints are that (1) the book doesn't include any review of accounting, which does come up in finance occasionally, and (2) there are just a few mistakes (but not too many). Overall, I found this book to be well worth the time & money I invested in it.	2003-04-21

Why not read Buffett in his own words, instead of reading books ABOUT Buffett? Many other books about Buffett cover his approach to investing, but his annual letters to his shareholders excerpted in this book cover the same material. His letters are filled with wit and insights, and he's got a  home-spun style that lightens up what might otherwise be a very dry subject. If you're not familiar with Buffett's value-based investing approach, then you'll learn about it here, and how it's helped him average an eye-popping 25% average annual return for 35 years running. For those already familiar with Buffett's approach, it's still enjoyable to read him in his own words.  Highly recommended.	2003-04-04

The guide doesn't cover interview prep or the specific knowledge required to do the job, but there are various other guides that cover that material.

In this book, which is essential a long interview, Soros expounds on his market philosophies and political views. Personally, I found this book better structured and more informative than his previous book, \\"The Alchemy of Finance.\\"<br />As the book begins, Soros goes into the details about how he founded and runs his fund. He started as a trader, then an analyst, then created a model portfolio that he managed as a sales tool for when he talked to his clients. He left his firm and started his hedge fund at age 43, with $12M in 1973. In 1981, retired from active management and hired other fund managers to run the Quantum fund.<br />When running the fund, he is a macro investor, since he claims he's better at picking the tide rather than surfing the smaller waves in the markets. He tends to form an opinion on the direction of a currency, stock market, or interest rates, then trades within the view he set. <br />Soros also describes his market philosophy, which he described previously in \\"Alchemy of Finance.\\" His concept, dubbed reflexivity, claims that market's movements influences people's perceptions, but since people trade based on their biased perceptions, they in turn influence the market. The result is that perceptions and market movements co-evolve, and may drift away from the fundamentals and, in some cases, change the fundamentals. The result is familiar boom-bust patterns, such as trend-following behavior in markets followed by crashes. As a result, Soros follows trends, but remains alert for signs of reversals. <br />Soros is also a major philanthropist, and has created foundations to spread open societies into Eastern Europe. There is a significant portion of the book devoted to his political work, however I found that less interesting, not because his views aren't valid or well articulated, but because I bought the book primarily to learn about Soros' work in finance.<br />Overall, I found this a good read in finance. Although you won't come out with 10 sure-fire stock tips for your 401(k), this book is certainly a must for Soros fans, or any intrigued investor who would like to learn from one of today's most successful financiers.	2003-03-06

However, I found his wordy tome is a slightly burdensome read. Most of his most valuable points are in the first 80 pages; the remaining 300 could have been trimmed down by a wise editor. <br />Soros' main points revolve around a concept that he dubs \\"reflexivity.\\" Reflexivity claims a few things: First, that prices aren't objective; they're based on people's biased perceptions of the fundamental factors influencing the market. Second, people make trades based on their biased perceptions, so perceptions will influence the market. Third, and most importantly, those market movements can in turn change the market's underlying fundamentals. There is, therefore, a continuous co-evolution of the market fundamentals, the market's price movements, and market participants' perceptions. <br />Let's run through an example to make this clear. Say a profitless Internet company's stock soars because investors have overblown expectations of earnings growth. That company could then use its inflated stock in a stock-swap to aquire another company that DOES has earnings. This aquisition would thus \\"justify\\" the stock's inflated stock value. Thus, mistaken perceptions have allowed a change in the structure of an industry (i.e. two companies merged which would not have earlier).  <br />Soros makes a number of other valuable points about \\"reflexivity.\\" He notes that traditional economics try to sidestep the issue of subjectivity and biased perceptions by assuming people behave rationally, which of course isn't always true. To demonstrate this, he points out that we see reflexive behavior all over the markets. For example, we see self-reinforcing price trends (people buy because a stock is going up, or sell when it's going down), rather than random-walks in prices. We see booms & busts in the credit markets. And so on.<br />Finally, the genesis of the title, \\"The Alchemy of Finance\\" comes from Soros' observation that finance can never be a science because the traditional tools of science -- that is, explanation, prediction and objectivity -- can't be used, because perceptions and subjectivity cannot be seperated out like they can in a controlled science experiment. Finance can only be a form of alchemy -- it seeks operational success, instead of being able to seeking and test fundamental laws as the scientific method does. <br />Overall, I found the book insightful in parts, but rambling. Some other reviewers claimed that the book was pseudo-intellectual.  I did find that it lack academic rigor, but I can't be sure if that's because he was writing for a popular audience. <br />Since the book was written in the late 80's, there's been growing interest & academic research at the intersection between psychology and financial markets. Soros was not the first to recognize that financial markets involve a good dose of psychology, but his book serves to underscore this important truth about the market.	2003-02-21

Maier's basic central theme is that the 5 years he spent working for the maniacal hedge-fund manager Jim Cramer was very difficult. He fills page after page with stories of Jim's maniacal antics and rages, which gets repetitive after a while. But in between those descriptions, he describes the inner workings of Cramer's hedge fund, from a grunt's perspective.  There aren't a lot of insights here about the market -- it's mostly a tale about how Maier learned to survive while learning about how the market really works.	2003-02-05

I was pleasantly surprised -- Cramer gives sharp insights into the world of hedge funds and into what makes him tick, and a well as a behind-the-scenes look at his web-site, 'thestreet.com'.  Cramer was a journalist before he worked on Wall Street, and his writing makes for a good read.<br />Cramer takes us through his life, from his stock-picking days as a teenager, to his years as a newspaper journalist, to his schooling at Harvard, to his first securities job at Goldman Sachs leading up to the early days of the hedge fund he founded. He devotes 3 chapters to a blow-by-blow description of what he was thinking during a few volitile trading days in 1998, which really gives one insight to how fund managers think (despite what you may think of Cramer's personality, he claims to have significantly outperformed the market, which is no small feat). Also, the chapters on 'thestreet.com' were fascinating -- how his web site got started, how he lost management control of it, how he gained it back, and also how its IPO was a disaster.  <br />Another interesting aspect of this book is the descriptions of Cramer's lifelong loyalties -- loyalties to his wife (for whom he seemingly has infinite respect both personally &amp; profesionally), to his business partner Marty, to his former employer, Goldman Sachs. <br />Overall, this was a good read. Cramer's book is part hedge-fund expose, part biography, and part dot-com saga. And after reading it, I've learned a bit more about the inner workings of hedge funds. I also admit I have a bit more respect for Cramer's accomplishments -- though I'll still continue to lower the volume whenever he comes on CNBC.	2003-02-05

In his 71 page text, &quot;The Future of an Illusion,&quot; he tackles the subject of religion. A livelong atheist, Freud argues that religion is derived from a child-like sense of helplessness in the world. Its purpose, he says, is to explain the sometimes-unfathomable world, to provide societal order, and to give comfort and happiness (particularly for the &quot;the masses&quot; and the poor, uneducated and oppressed). Although Freud wants to reshape civilization's relationship with religion, he also recognizes that widespread atheism could undermine societal stability.  Overall, this is a good, quick read -- perfect for those interested in religion/atheism, psychology and the intersection between the two.	2003-01-21

The book consists of 2 parts: a 42 page introductory essay, and then about 120 pages of his &quot;rules,&quot; with one tip per page (some rules are only a couple lines on an otherwise blank page, which makes for quick reading). <br />The opening essay makes the argument that the courtier spirit is alive and well in America. In Europe's monarchies centuries ago, success could obtained by flattering the king.  But in the US's democracy today, there are actually more 'kings' than there were then: there are CEOs, senators, executives, and editors -- they in turn control financial investments, defense contracts, government subsidies, book publications, and the media. As large corporations, governments and institutions become more pervasive, and power is concentrated into the hands of this new aristocracy, the more important it becomes to use of flattery, connections, networking, tact and image management in order get ahead. This observation is the heart of Lapham's thesis.<br />To apply this thesis to the real world, Lapham has 120 pages of &quot;tips,&quot; many based on his personal experiences. Here's a few of his major points: One should only associate those more important people who can do you favors. When with the powerful, one should be polite, of course, but one should also avoid expressing strong opinions or emotions or ideas (although name-dropping is OK to show how connected you are). When speaking, one should have a certain seriousness and gravitas, but you need not say anything of substance -- he recommends using vague or abstract language full of cliché's &amp; euphemisms, as they can actually a familiar comfort to listeners.  Finally, one shouldn't try to be be brilliant or witty in public; realize that since mediocrity is the norm, an excessive display of intelligence could frighten others away.<br />Overall, Lapham's book was a fun read, though,as one reviewer wrote, it &quot;drips acid.&quot;  If you're an aspiring social climber or want to shimmy up the corporate ladder, and you're looking for some light reading &amp; some pithy advice, then this book is highly recommended.	2002-10-28

It didn't do that -- it was more of a political philosopher \\"sampler\\", rather than an overview which outlines the high points in the intellectual history of the field.   The first 10 pages of the ~50 page essay made some good distinctions & definitions, and emphasized that one should read the \\"great books\\" of political philosophy (though it doesn't give a list of those books until the appendix). The rest of the essay wasn't as informative, and just touches on some of the ideas of a couple major philosophers (e.g. Machiavelli, Plato, etc.), and tended to be slightly more interpretive than I like to see in an introduction (intro's should be more objective, because a beginner has a hard time distinguishing opinion from fact).  Overall, this book only gave me a \\"feel\\" for what political philosophy is,  without giving a sense of the entire scope of the field, the connections and/or debate between the various schools of thought, or the relative importance of the various thinkers.  Granted, it's hard to give a comprehensive overview in 50 pages, but I think the essay could have been structured better.

In this book, he consoles the poor, unpopular, frustrated, inadequate, lovelorn, and those facing difficulties with lessons from Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. This is not a somber, rigorous philosophical text, and it doesn't pretend to be; it lightly touches on the works of some of the heavyweights of philosophy, and it provides some entertaining insights. Overall, I thought it was a light, enjoyable read. If you haven't read any of de Botton's other works, read &quot;How Proust can change your life&quot; first (I believe it's slightly better), then if you enjoy that, continue on to this book.	2002-09-05

It clearly dissects the problem of why it's so hard to achieve a suitable work/life balance today, and clearly describes some underlying causes. For me, it certainly lived up to the praise it has gotten.  <br />In short, Reich's central idea is this: as consumers, we love the terrific products and deals we're getting in today's marketplace as a result of increased competition. However, the dark site of this is that we must work longer hours as employees and be more innovative to ensure our companies outpace the competition. These time pressures are fragmenting our personal lives as we reduce the time we spend with friends, family and community. Reich has many interesting insights and observations beyond this overall theme as well. Overall, I recommend this book -- reading it was time well spent.	2002-08-28

Pappano unites many small, seemingly disparate observations about modern living by showing how our lives are requiring less and less interactions with other people. The result is that we're creating a \\"connection gap,\\" where we fail to truly connect in a meaningful way with others. Also, we've moved from a society with an emphasis on the group and responsibility to others, to one where the central figure is the self. Throughout the book, Pappano supplements her own observations with reams of statistics and numerous references, and in the end, I found the result thorough and insightful. The only complaint I have is that Papanno's theme was somewhat repetitive at points. <br />Here is a sampling of the examples that Papanno uses to support her thesis that modern requires less interactions with other people, thus creating a \\"connection gap:\\" <br />Our homes are also becoming small fortresses -- we increasingly use Caller-ID to screen our calls, install home security systems or live in gated communities, and don't even live in houses with porches anymore. Why would you? All the action is on the inside of the house. Also, new homes have grown larger -- the average square footage for new houses has gone up by 41% over past 30 years. Now-days, each person can retreat to their own nook in the house, rather than watching the family TV with each other, or lingering in the same rooms. Bathrooms have grown more luxurious, and we retreat into these private spas to relax alone. Kitchens are larger, too, but people families are more likely to be eating alone sequentially, rather than having the whole family sit down together for a meal & talking about the events of the day. <br />In the car, TVs and VCRs are now available in minivans, so the kids in the back seat can watch a tape while Mom & Dad drive while listening to their favorite CD, thus avoiding interactions with the kids. If the kids want music, they can put on a walkman, and have their own separate, private musical experience without involving anyone else.<br />We may drive our minivans to the new main street of America, the Mall. There, we may satisfy more than our lust for stuff; attentive salespeople also provide what we crave: personal and undivided attention that we don't get from each other. The mall is a natural place for many people, since the consumer mentality is what defines some people. For them, you are what you buy, so you must shop well (\\"say you love her with a diamond!\\"). Also, we may want to shop to \\"keep up with the Jones',\\" but increasingly we don't know our neighbors, much less know what their living room looks like (after all, we haven't dropped in on them or socialized with them extensively). Therefore, we increasingly determine our wants by judging our lifestyle against images we see on TV.<br />We are also increasingly isolated because many interactions that previously involved people are now handled by screens. We view the world through the ATM screen, the TV screen, cruise the internet to shop on the computer screen. We no longer touch the things we buy online, or linger to chat with the bank teller. Screens often these give the illusion of power (you get to choose!), and indeed it is often better to use a screen than to be someplace in person (consider the instant replays at the SuperBowl, for example). However, there is merit to talking to someone face-to-face rather than on a conference call, or going to a ball game and smelling the hot-dogs rather than watching it at home on TV in an easy-chair.<br />Also, our interactions with friends has changed. Now-days it's rude to just \\"drop in\\" on people. We schedule interactions with our friends because we're busy, and most likely we'll plan activity rather than just linger. Even if you're lingering around with another person doesn't guarantee their attention, since an incoming cell-phone call may divert them to chat with someone else. These types of managed, scheduled, and purposeful interaction with friends don't foster the lingering and slow self-disclosure that traditionally leads to building satisfying, meaningful friendships. <br />Additionally, we're less tolerant of others than we used to be. There's a greater sense of entitlement today -- we think we \\"deserve\\" a perfect car, job, or life partner, and as a result we are less willing to compromise, and evaluate relationships to determine if they're wasting our time -- after all, we want our needs to be attended to, so why be with others don't meet our needs? <br />Furthermore, we don't get as personally involved in community organizations & clubs, increasingly hire lawyers to settle our differences for us, and show increasing amounts of road-rage. <br />So, given all this, what are we to do? Papanno provides a few recommendations. First, we should revive the art of conversation, and really listen to each other. Next, we should unplug from our electronic distractions -- cell phone, pagers, screens of all sorts -- when the intrude excessively on our lives. Also, we should do more ourselves, rather than relying on experts to help us. The slim recommendations chapter was somewhat of a disappointment, but the issues are multifaceted and don't lend themselves to simple solutions.	2002-08-09

However, it fails to do so on many counts.<br />First, the book is based on the author's experiences with her own marriage as well as the advice she collected from her friends. In short, before she leaned to \\"surrender\\" to her husband, she bossed him around, nagged him, criticized his ideas, insulted him, and took over in many situations because she simply didn't trust him. In time, she discovered that these behaviors weren't enhancing her marriage (surprise, surprise!), so, on the advice of friends, she decided to cut down on her criticism. And guess what? Her husband warmed to her up a bit. Now she's preaching these revelations and other suggestions in this book and in a series of seminars.<br />It's disturbing that she is dishing out relationship advice to a wide audience, especially since she does NOT have any background in the field of relationships. Although her method obviously worked for her and may perhaps work for other women who are also self-confessed \\"control freaks\\" it's hard to imagine that the advice she gives could be valid for everyone in today's world. The fact that she has a degree in journalism, not psychology, and worked as a copywriter, not a counselor, doesn't add to the book's credibility.<br />Also, the use of the word \\"surrendered\\" in the book's title is very misleading. She explains that she \\"adopted the word \\"surrender\\" as [her] mantra, because it was shorter and more to the point than saying, \\"stop trying to control everything\\"\\". To me, \\"surrender\\" implies some kind of battle for command in her marriage; she never acknowledges any middle ground between \\"surrendering\\" and being a \\"control-freak\\", and the possibility of a relationship between equals who communicate, negotiate when necessary, and respect each other's relative strengths isn't even hinted at.<br />This book may sell millions of copies to people who want to see what the controversy surrounding it is all about. If you're reading this, though, I hope you won't be one of those people. However, if you DO want some quality relationship advice based on sound scientific research by trained professionals....opies to people who want to see what the controversy surrounding it is all about.

The story is very entertaining and complex, and has many interwoven  storylines. As the novel accelerated to a peak in the last chapter, I was  hoping for a snappy climax. After reading the final chapter &amp; Epilogue,  though, I felt cheated -- the conclusion seemed unrealistic, and a mediocre  way (at best) way of resolving all the conflicts. Despite the poor  conclusion, I would recommend reading this book -- it was an enjoyable  story with strong characters &amp; vivid descriptions -- just be prepared  to tear out the last 2 chapters and write your own.	1999-10-04
US	53072100	RSA7YVALJD7SB	0872863328	226655951	Close to the Machine: Technophilia and Its Discontents	Books	4	11	13	N	N	Technology in Human/Personal Terms	If you're fascinated by the impacts of computer technology in personal and  human terms, then you'll enjoy this book. On the surface, Ullman gives us a  glimpse into the life of a consulting software engineer musing about the  meaning and impact of technology. Ullman's world is filled with  machine-like programmers drawn to the supremely logical world of software  development, as well as managers who don't truly understand the technology  or programmers that they are managing. Like a true techie, Ullman can  easily convey rush of excitement when a debugged system finally *works* --  but unlike a true techie, she can just as easily describe the  quirky,  mechanical personalities of the people working &quot;close to the  machine(s).&quot; Throughout, she intersperses some thoughts about her  career, ranging from the stress of keeping up techno-savvy hot-shots, to  the risks of working for startups, to the real impact &quot;virtual  companies&quot; on society.  Ullman's style was witty, insightful, and a  joy to read -- I easily devoured this book in one day.  In the end, this  book is more about people than it is about technology, so I'd recommend it  to anyone who is interested in the human side of the technology equation.	1998-08-23
