I found out this gon be a good place to start. First and foremost, this is very interesting to me 'cuz it's similar to what the Holy Bible talks about on what we read at Church and on Bible Study. Can't say 'nuff 'bout this. I also recommend the Holy Kabbalah, The Living Bible, and the Jerusalem Bible to go along. Even I go to church almost every Sunday, I still have a Miracle to call the Lord's presence. HALLEJUAH!!! A mostly Must. Lot of good stuff and information.	2005-10-08

As I said before nobody touch him or mess with him. He's still gon remain the same man and nobody can't take that away from him. To me, he's like a brother, a friend and mentor who can teach all kinds of things. I been a fan to Michael since I was 5 or 6 in 1990 and still is from this day. I thought it'll be easier to checkout the book. For example, there's only 6 chapters but it's not a bad book or a long book but still a real short book. Real interesting stuff and alot of good information I'll say. There 3 things I didn't know about Michael 1. He's a vegetarian who doesn't eat meat 2. He's a Devout Jehovah's Witnesses and 3. That he's really shy and doesn't even too much talking or too many interviews 'cuz that'll interfere him. Long period short. I just pray in God's Hand that Michael, Jacko, Mike or MJ will just come back and do a 2nd follow-up to his classic bestseller like for instance 'nother memoir (or autobiography) or perhaps a poetry book. Still can't wait to read it over the 2nd time above. God bless the King of Pop for hard book. Luv ya Michael. I'm a real Diehard fan to your music and you'll always be my hero growing up in Music.	2005-10-02

This marks as a first-time lover or beginner to the legendary of Jazz, Blues and all other types of music, Mr. Jimmy Scott. Everybody's been talking 'bout him. 'Cuz he sure has a sweet and sensational voice, one's whose range that can stand tall from anybody. Nobody gonna get this or learn more about the man unless they read this book 'cuz it'll take further than is has. I once dug him while singing a song on David Sanborn's CD \\"Pearls\\" and it's pretty amazing on how he sounds 'cuz I thought at 1st it was a lady singing like Oleta Adams or so but now it's a male who can sing like a lady blues singer or a jazz singer. I'm talkin' bout Jimmy Scott man!!! To me, I've been thinking 'bout bein' a journalist or writer somehow in the future if that's what's on my mind a minute ago. 'Cuz I'ma be like the black version or next coming of David Ritz, Gary Giddins, Quincy Troupe, Mike Dyson, Nelson George, among others. <br /> <br />Bravo to Bro. David Ritz for doing such a good job on this extradionary book. I wish more from him in the future.	2005-09-30

Why u're gonna dis her or treat her like that 'cuz this is not REAL or it ain't Aretha at all? Ya'll haters should be ashamed. I'm happy to share one of my all-time favorite artists off this book co-written by her and writer himself Mr. David Ritz. When I getting ready to read this, I found it quite interesting to see behind the life and times of Aretha Louise Franklin (her full name). Can't describe to yet maybe later. She was and still is today THE QUEEN OF SOUL. She stands along as \\"Rev. Aretha\\" which is my new nickname to dubbed 'cuz she can blow and can knock the place down in a heartbeat like Bro. Ray Charles. Once I finished BROTHER RAY, I'm amazed to do the same w/ ARETHA: AFTER THESE ROOTS. And 1st and foremost, both of these books aren't that dissappointing or just depressing. Lemme they're Must-Haves and really Great books. Love 'em all. For all the naysayers and the haters need to go back listening to her albums or Greatest Hits compilations to prove your lil' interest and then or before read the book if that's the case. For the lovers that bought it and loved it and totally agree w/ it, I don't blame ya and I'm not gonna let ya'll down. Please stop w/ the fuss 'bout Aretha not being the Greatest Artist or Greatest Female Singer of All-Time since Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, James Brown and Smokey Robinson. Truly a Must if u're interested. If not, then this in not 4 u, read something else or perhaps the Bible.	2005-09-29

Kelly - Music, Love, Sex and Money (An Unauthorized Biography)	Books	3	1	1	N	Y	This is the story you gotta hear!!! (3-3.5 overall stars)	This book is amazing and incredible and mostly a good fantastic read dealing w/ the life and times, good and bad situations, trials and tribulations between himself Mr. R. Kelly (whose real name is Robert L. Kelly based off the book). He is a Chicago (or Chi-Town) native which ppl subscribe 'cuz he has the talents and abilities 2 be a successful superstar 2 a great inspiring Genius in the making of a variety of music genres i.e. R&B, gospel, jazz, pop, rock, hip-hop, rap---you name it.    Truly 2 me R. Kelly's the man and greatly the baddest producer, singer, musician, writer, songwriter, hardest workin' man and artist in the music biz since Marvin Gaye, Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder did they thing. I truly cited the R. as the post-Marvin Gaye of our time like others like Barry White, Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra, Miles Davis, Aretha Franklin, just to name a few.    No matter whether he did right or wrong, he still 'gon remain the same like 2Pac, the world's best-selling rapper of all-time This is such good research in this bk. and I haven't even put it down yet. Read it in 2 consecutive days. Received it by mail yesterday and was impressed. It tells all the details which u heard and haven't heard...YET.    R. Kelly (named the Pied Piper of R&B), is truly my hero, my role model, on my top list, a great bigger influence, and truly my all-time favorite artist. I recommend books like Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye and Brother Ray all by David Ritz, Smokey, Inside my Life among other bks. by the same author, Miles Davis' memoir, Mase's (aka Pastor Betha of S.A.N.E. Church in Atlanta) memoir Revelations, Man in the Mirror by Patrick Morley (my favorite author), Emerging Church and Emerging Worship all by Dan Kimball, Moonwalk by Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones' memoir Q, Al Green's memoir, How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie, Mercy Mercy Me: The Art, Loves and Demons of Marvin Gaye by Mike E. Dyson, most books by Napoleon Hill, Stephen Covey, Brian Tracy, among others. it's a still a Long List.    Deeply a must if u're interested.	2005-08-13

Yet David Ritz is such a Fantastic music writer and critic (as MisterMaxx said in 2000) who talks about the lives, trials and temptations of various artists (i.e. Marvin Gaye, Bill Withers, Aretha Franklin, Barry White, Etta James, etc.) incl. songwriters, producers, movie and TV stars, etc. He's truly one of my heroes and also my all-time favorite. I luv him to death. I dig him on permanent basis or else on frequent basis I mean. He maybe the sounds of world's famous authors out there who are ill and real underrated y'know that discusses what's going on between the music scene, the movie scene, politics, religion, education, etc. If u luv David Ritz, I recommend u'll luv some good I mean best well-known authors or book writers like Michael Eric Dyson, Cornel West, Kevin Powell, Mark Anthony Neal, Nelson George, Marc Eliot, Leonard Feather, Gene Lees, Gary Giddins, etc.  <br /> <br />Ok back 2 what I said on the memoir by Smokey (whose real name is William Robinson) is b/c this book is very interesting and mostly good 2 read. He truly is the baddest man in the music world since Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye, among others. It deals w/ his past as a music star, dealing w/ family problems incl. his mom leaving him behind at an earlier age, how did he created and formed the group SM & the Miracles, when did he met & worked w/ Berry Gordy, the founder and creator of Hitsville Records now known today as Motown, how he got addicted 2 drugs and soon gave his life up to the Lord and so on and on. He did had a gospel album put out last yr. so hopefully sooner or later I'll cop it. I 'member 1 time I wasn't into 'cuz that's not the gospel side of Smokey IMO, so I changed my mind 'bout that to see it's still good or not. <br /> <br />Books I recommend are: <br /> <br />1) Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye <br />2) Brother Ray: Ray Charles' Own Story (get the '04 edition that incls. the final days of Bro. Ray written by author David Ritz himself) <br />3) The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom by Suze Orman <br />4) Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill <br />5) Dianetics by L. Ron Hubbard <br />6) Emerging Church and Emerging Worship all by Dan Kimball <br />7) How to Make Friends and Influence People and How to Start Worrying and Start Living all by Dale Carniege <br />8) Man in the Mirror by Patrick Morley (One of my fav. authors to date!) <br />9) The 7 Habits of Very Effective People by Stephen Covey <br />10) On Becoming a Leader by Warren Bennis <br /> <br />There sum more I may add a lil bit later on. So enjoy the bk.	2005-07-19

CHRISTOPHER REEVE (1952-2004)	I been a fan to the late Christopher Reeve from the top y'know from movies, to TV, and also doing interviews about his lifetime and his past and everything. Man he left us too quick. I still haven't read the book yet but one day I'll get a chance. He definitely lives between me in my heart and soul. Christopher Reeve was also a mentor to those that follow his footsteps and to those that have suffered from disabilites and all of that stuff y'knowwhattamean? I can't forget the time when on May 28, 1995 when he was riding his horse for a horserace, he fell off and broke his neck real badly. Boy that's gotta hurt. That's why he spend the rest of his life paralyzed in a wheelchair until the end of his life like Richard Pryor from MS (mental schrolis, did I get it right?), Curtis Mayfield (who suffered from his accident in 1990 while performance at a concert in Atlanta or something), and especially Teddy Pendergrass (who is also my mentor, idol, inspiration and especially a role model to me, went thru a lot when he got injured in a car accident in 1982 and then again in 1986. I halfly read a few parts of his memoir he did in '98, but haven't pick it up, something I looking forward of reading and adding in my book collection ASAP). For example we all go thru life situations and especially some ups and downs. That's why we need to take the time easily to watch ourselves where we go, how we live, and we can defeat it and learn to sacrifice and survive until the day we perish or leave this world. I truly thank Christopher Reeve for putting out a wonderful story on his life and congrats on him leaving us a legacy that'll live on forever. God Bless You, Christopher Reeve, you'll will be remembered and GBNF (Gone But Not Forgotten). Rest in peace.	2005-03-28

I'm haven't gave it away or stop reading it for example. I believe it shows a message of what's going on in life right now and how we can resurrect from falling or disappearing. I think everybody should read this if they luv God. A lotta people saying it's too contradictional or it's not showing a lot of info to it or something. Just like THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST which I seen which talks about it.  <br /> <br />I'm blessed to have this book 'cuz it'll take me a long way. Nobody nor Christians or Non-Christians should live without this. If u seen the movie, it'll tell you. Yep I'm still goin on w/ the book.  <br /> <br />Hope u enjoy this and check out THE LAST STREET FIGHTER right after this.	2005-03-12

James Brown was always a legend of our time and he brought us so many memories that he did to his music. That's why he's is called the Godfather of Soul or mos definitely I would say the Fastest Man in Show Business. <br /> <br />I'd just finished reading Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye by my man and favorite author David Ritz and I read it over and over 'cuz it's still my favorite book of all time. <br /> <br />	2005-02-24

I adore him as a man as my world. I bless God that Luther is doing alright now and maybe he'll drop out a memoir after this one. Luther had a lotta stories to tell to the world, how he lost his father at a young age from diabetes, how he grew up from the church, when did he started singing, how he collaborate from a variety of artists (i.e. Donny Hathaway, Roberta Flack, Patti Austin, Quincy Jones, etc.), when did he became a solo artist from the top in the early '80s, etc. <br /> <br />I recommend this if they want to hear more from the man or else never knew him at first. This would tear you out. Something I look forward reading.	2005-02-24

This is so inspirational since I read Revelations by Mase and Divided Soul by Marvin Gaye. I just wanted to say that I'm a man of my words and I can't say whatever I want w/o interfering nobody. I still love God and I'd been saved and baptized at the age of 14. <br /> <br />I just to let everybody that it's not wrong to recommend it if you love rappers or artists you do care to live or hate or whatever. This is not too much to ask for. Nor a contradiction, a piece of lack or hypocrisy. <br /> <br />I think everybody should have this if they want to come closer to God and stay with him. To me I'm not a Lucifer saint like Satan nor a Gentile nor a worldly Christian. I'm a sanctified spirit w/ a lot of courage and wisdom, prophet, disciple, Pharisee, you name it. <br /> <br />Ok long period of time, I'm blessed that rappers of today like Kanye, Mase, 50 Cent, Ludacris, Lil Kim, DMX, Common, Talib, Fabolous, Nas, and others are blessed by the Good Name of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. They still love God but not condemn him for what no matter of reason. <br /> <br />If u watch movies like \\"The Passion of the Christ\\", \\"Left Behind: The Movie\\", \\"Tupac: Resurrection\\", \\"Ray\\", \\"Collateral\\", etc., you would notice the side where God wants you to become. <br /> <br />I have a lotta faith in them incl. other artists I luv like Beyonce, Destiny's Child, Usher, Alicia Keys, etc. And always will be a mentor to them. God bless everyone in the Hip-Hop/R&B community for keepin it real and especially the holy hip-hop community which it's doing great. I'm proud of ya'll. <br /> <br />Recommend Ruminations: Krs-One by Kris Parker to go. And uhh...if u want to find more about, you can click on to [...] and go in to arguments where it talks about it. Peace and God bless. <br /> <br />	2005-02-24

This is a MUST read for any Marvin Gaye fan who wants to figure out this man's legacy. I'd admire him for how well he acheived. Even tho he's gone now he still lives on. There's nobody like him but just 1 Marvin Gaye. Marvin Gaye is such a Genius I inspired growing. 2 me I'm learning what he had left off from his career. To me if u love the sound of him or never even heard of him, u must pick this up. 'Cuz it'll take u on 4 journies. <br />This is incl. along w/ Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye, Miles: An Autobiography, and Revelations: There's a Light After the Lime.	2005-01-24

He really knows the ups and downs of Marvin Gaye's life. Oh that's such a blessing I think every Marvin Gaye fan should get this just b/c they wanna learn more 'bout this man. 2 me he's one of my idols I grew up 'cuz he's such an inspiration. This book tells it all from his days of sex, drugs, violence, threats between his dad, how he got involved in the resurrection of life and death and the coming side of R. Kelly's admirer of Gaye. You see Marvin never say \\"Give up on what u got\\". No he saids \\"Take it lightly and slowly when u dead and gone\\". That's why we need to check ourselves everyday to the fullest until we live this normal or martyred life. I haven't bought the book yet but I'll may go it ASAP once it's still here. This is such an interesting story from the man who did the lifetimes of Tupac Shakur, black women, black people, the culture of our nation and black music and now. Definitely recommend along w/ Mase's memoir and Miles' memoir.	2005-01-24

Yes this a great book to read if u wanna hear the real story of Ray Charles. It's very interesting to see about this man life and how became a stardom in the music world and the pop industry. Ray gotta lot to give to us. He's such a power and mastered Genius. We all know we miss him but he definitely lives on in this fantasic autobiography.

I can't wait to hear more from her but she remains my top fav. author of all-time 2 date which I suggest. I don't think u should give away any musical CD, book or whatever just b/c it's not helping u or helping u out or probably b/c u just wanted to let it go and move on with other stuff. This book means all the contradictions, trials and tribulations u face in life incl. depression, dying, suicide, pain, envy, divorce, friendship, broken relationships (saved or unsaved), u know all those things. People need to understand what it's coming from the heart. I think I should pick this up ASAP until I have currently read The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Primary Colors and Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye which I reading at this moment. No reader, buyer, or reviewer should be dissappointed about this @ all. This is definitely going into my collection of books I'm reading thru.	2005-01-21

It quite amaze me since I wanna learn more about jazz. This book would definitely take u far as being the best trumpet player u'll be. I'm also a trumpet player, and 'specially play other instruments I self-taught like the piano, keyboard, organ, harmonica, recorder, trombone, mellophone, French horn, euphonium, percussion, drums, flugelhorn, guitar, etc. <br /> <br />I'm not gonna say \\"I don't like this or whatever\\". I think it's a great introduction showing some basics and material work on how you 'gon be good at it. I know a lot of people don't agree what I'm saying. I believe that every trumpet player or music learner perhaps should have this along with Jazz & Blues, Arban's Conservatory Method for Trumpet, 1001 Blues Licks, 1001 Jazz Licks, Building a Jazz Vocabulary, The Jazz Fakebook, 28 Modern Jazz Trumpet Solos, Bks. 1 & 2, 14 Blues and Funk Etudes, and 14 Jazz and Funk Etudes all by Bob Mintzer. <br /> <br />Like this is definitely a book I should keep even tho I wanted practice some more I believe.	2005-01-12

Yeah this book talk more 'bout politics and how it's creating in our nation. I think nobody should be disappointing 'bout this 'cuz it has so many shortcuts and all of that knahmsayin. (e.g. y'know's, y'see's (I don't even use that word much as often), y'understand's, y'knawhattasayin's, y'knawhattamean's, etc.). I'm not saying it's all bad, but it's still good tho but need a lotta information on the discovery of Bill Clinton b/c I wanna check out his memoir he put out last year before his undying health. I pray that he'll go well and do just fine. Anyway check this book b/c it has a lot of information about it.	2005-01-10

I actually read this book from the beginning since I fell in love in it, as to me I'm a singer, rapper, artist and musician. This book tells it all from ragtime started, how swing & big bands got all over across the country, when Miles, Dizzy, Bird, Coltrane, Duke, Count, Satchmo, Billie, Ella, Sarah, Clifford, etc. came out 2day's hottest pioneers of jazz, and how jazz-rap or jazz hip-hop was made. I can't even put it down 'cuz it's good tho. This is recommend who want to know the whole history behind it. Even tho u like jazz, blues, bebop, rap, hip-hop or both. A must.	2005-01-10

I used to HATE IT, but now I love it. I think Quincy tells it all on he grew up the most wonderful entertainers of the year. I think he could be an inspiration to me. I actually grew up with him since I listen to some albums and artists he work with in past. From Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Patti Austin, James Ingram, Chaka Kahn, Donna Summer, Ray Charles, Duke Ellington, Lesley Gore, Frank Sinatra, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, 2Pac, George Benson, Howard Hewett, Sammy Nestico, The Brothers Johnson, Luther Vandross, Sarah Vaughn, Dinah Washington, Steven Spielberg, the whole list goes on and on. Y'know Quincy Jones could be know as the pioneer of music history or else I would the most famous man in town. I think he'll be remember as a person who's trying to make live in the music world and the music business. This is definitely a book I should recommend who wants to hear more about this man and his legacy. He's actually the founder of VIBE magazine which I read all the time which is pretty amazing.	2005-01-10

This is sumthin u shouldn't hate about or u think is racist enuff or sumthin. I don't call it by that. I call a more mature book that has the basic details that what's going in our community and the culture we live in today.<br /><br />Many of us who are sacrificing and showing mercy among ourselves to this book or the man behind himself must read this book. This is really a study guide to talk about our community. Spike Lee does a good job on this movie he did from the book. And I thank God he'll live and learn 2 this day.<br /><br />R.I.P.

I highly recommend you should check Young Chet: The Chet Baker Story, the documentaries Let's Get Lost and Live at Ronnie's Scott, The life of Chet Baker or sumthin. <br /> <br />This is must-read to those who wants to hear the true story about Chet.
