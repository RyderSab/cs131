This is the book for you! Although written by a Catholic for a Catholic audience, everyone who strives to grow in prayer can learn something from here. Replete with scriptural and saintly wisdom (clearly referenced with footnotes), the book shows how a soul grows ever closer to God and more like our Lord Jesus Christ as his/her interior life develops. It also deals with the stages of that development and the true signs of growth that one can watch for.  I found it very helpful in understanding many aspects of scripture. I also found a number of simple spiritual exercises which I could apply immediately to my life and which have made me understand on an inexplicably deep level how truly merciful God is to all of us and how truly helpless we are without Him. I could ramble on at length, but I will stop here and just say BUY THIS BOOK!	2004-07-05

This books shows that the author does know something about it, and there is helpful information in the book, particularly the idea that everything you do can and should be offered up as a prayer. However, I find that it is written in too &quot;theoretical&quot; of a style (i.e. not enough concrete examples of what he means). Furthermore, I do not agree with many of his statements such as, &quot;One mistake is that of looking at religion for something that it is not the primary purpose of religion to provide. People will take up religion for the consolation they expect to get out of it in their sorrows. They turn to God because they feel that human companionship is not to be relied upon, and that possibly a relationship with God may ward off agonies of loneliness&quot; He writes a bit more at length about this, and makes a good point about not using religion as a drug and abandoning it when it doesn't work, but it is precisely this comfort that our Lord Himself extended to his followers &quot;Come to me all of you who are tired of bearing heavy loads.&quot; God does indeed offer us consolation in our sorrows and this is precisely the reason why many sought our Lord Jesus out when He lived with us on earth. They sought Him out for forgiveness and healing and later on, were willing to make great sacrifices because of their love for Him. Who are we to scorn those who seek the Lord out because they need consolation? After this, the author makes another incomprehensible statement &quot;Another mistake people make about religion is to expect it to shed more and more light upon both the truths of faith and the personal problems that come up for decision&quot; then he follows this with a paragraph which I cannot fathom the meaning of.  Isit a mistake to meditate on your spiritual beliefs (I'm assuming that this is what he means by religion) and on God's word when you are trying to find a godly solution to a problem in your life? Is it wrong to seek the Lord's guidance as you grapple with a decision? Or am I just very stupid and unable to comprehend what this lofty-minded individual is trying to communicate? He has a section entitled &quot;Learn to obey authority&quot; he makes the appalling statement that &quot;A soul is being truly wise when it bows to the decision of a stupid superior.&quot;  (Can someone who is truly stupid be called superior?!?!) He elaborates on this: &quot;If you have vowed before God to obey a husband who turns out to be stupid, misinformed or prejudiced (eh? Turns out? Didn't you know what he was like when you married him?!? Perhaps he is addressing an audience in the time of arranged marriages?).....(intervening clauses and sentences here)....he can command you to do what you may happen to think is unreasonable and if he does you have to obey.&quot; These are dangerous instructions. What if your spouse forces you to sumbit to a beating at his hands? I know of priests who have counseled battered women to endure this in silence &quot;for the glory of God and conversion of sinners.&quot; I do not agree with this. One of the works of mercy is to admonish the sinner and if your spouse is COMMANDING you or anyone else to do something against their will and better judgment it is your obligation to let him/her know that they are behaving offensively. They are SINNING when they do this and to remain silent is to be an accomplice to that sin. To conscienciously object is the LOVING thing to do.Did our Lord remain silent in the face of the Pharisees' hypocrisy? No He constantly admonished them. In fact, did He remain silent when He observed wrongs committed by anyone? No He did not. There is no formula for determining when one is to remain silent or voice objections. As with everything we do, we must bring the problem to God in prayer and patiently wait for His direction. On top of everything else, we must be conscious of the example we are showing our children. In a healthy home, husbands and wives treat each other lovingly and respectfully. In such a home, there is no room nor should there be any reason for a husband to COMMAND his wife to do anything or vice versa. Having said all that, I think the prayers at the end of the book are appropriate, although I think it would be far better for a housewife to pray to God in her own words with the sentiments born of the loving sacrifices she has made as part of her vocation.	2004-07-01

I borrowed this book from the library for my son (thank God I didn't BUY it!) and was horrified to discover all the mistakes in it. And it's from a reputable publisher too. How the author could have made the mistakes that he did in writing this book is beyond me.  Surely most of the info he needed for this is given on the Air Force Web pages. From the moment my son opened the book, I found myself explaining that there ARE women fighter pilots and that the air force base in Virginia is Langley, not Largely (?!?!). How many other errors there are, I do not know, but those two alone were enough to bias me against the book. I see another reviewer found quite a few more. I guess if we want to find out more about the Air Force, we should just check out their web site. DON'T buy this book!	2004-01-27

I do think though, that this information is better spoken than sung (at least by Mr Rosenberg, who has a lovely speaking voice but a very distracting singing one!). No doubt the little ditties that he sings are intended as useful mnemonics for what he is saying on the tape, but I found them difficult to listen to. In my opinion, his book, Nonviolent Communication does a great job of introducing his way of thinking and the communication techniques that result from that. I find his suggestions quite useful in learning how to treat my children with more respect and in making them aware that we all have needs and that we must train ourselves to hear other people's needs, sometimes in spite of what they are saying. If you already have his book, skip this tape. If you have neither the book nor the tape, buy the book!	2003-09-04

I was initially impressed by the beautiful art in the Old Testament section. Imagine my shock when I discovered Jesus, a middle Eastern man, depicted with blond hair and blue eyes! Of course, no one of us has actually seen Jesus, but since he was born a Jew, it is highly unlikely that he had this coloring. The text is nothing remarkable. It is not particularly friendly to very young children. I found Today's English version of the Bible (American Bible Society) to be much more suitable for a child without unnecessarily \\"dumbing down\\" the message. I have a feeling that I will be selling this book to a second hand store pretty soon.	2003-05-19

This book is by no means encyclopedic in scope! ...Some patterns are given in chart form and some instructions are written out -- why not be consistent? Also, I had to flip around to find the chart legends (they didn't say where it was in the stitch section of the book). Oh well, if glossy pages, colorful photos and glitzy models (wearing sweaters for which no instructions are given!) inspire you, I guess this would be a nice but nonessential addition to your library.

I would have given the book 5 stars, but there is a dearth of safety information for some herbs (e.g. comfrey, coltsfoot, lily of the valley, sassafras)which I feel is a serious omission. Someone just starting to learn about herbs may start consuming them on a regular basis before coming across the safety information elsewhere. Also, in the section on body systems, the recommended herbal recipes are accompanied by symbols which are not explained anywhere in the text (or if they are, the explanation is very well hidden because I can't find it!) Other than that, the book contains a great introduction to how the body's various systems work and also a lot of common sense advice on optimizing health (not just illness prevention). The philosophy of herbal treatment (treating the whole person as opposed to treating a symptom or a disease) is nicely discussed. Also the therapeutic index makes it easy to find herbs that you can try for specific health needs. A nice addition to the herbal library as long as you have other books that offer the safety info that this one lacks!	2003-02-17

The herb profiles contain everything you would want to know about an herb before using it. The safety rating is such a great tool. I wonder why Duke is the first herbalist to think of it (at least I think he's the first. Never seen it in any other herbal). In this collection of herbs, there are North, South and Central American plants as well as European and Asian ones. There's a nice therapeutic index too, listing what herbs are good for which conditions. Duke has a great writing style.

It's useful to see your options laid out like that. I like the organization. It's easy to find what you need. I also like that one of the authors has an M.D. it's encouraging to see that a traditionally trained doctor sees the value of phytomedicinals. The book is organized by health problems. Under each heading, there is a listing of herbal as well as conventional remedies, as well as a paragraph describing how each remedy works. This method of organization makes much more sense than listing herbs alphabetically, especially for someone who's in a hurry to find something. I only just received the book from amazon.com, but I can already foresee that I will use it often. I only wish they had made the book bigger and printed it on nicer paper.

Not only that, the author seems to favor the use of highly processed ingredients. She appears to be far more concerned with the texture or appearance of her creams than with their being as unprocessed as possible. As I read through the book, I found myself wondering how in the world anyone with a life could find the time to hunt down all the ingredients (many are quite exotic, and she doesn't suggest substitutes), let alone prepare them. I was quite disappointed. There are many easier-to-procure-ingredients which will be just as therapeutic for the skin. The description on the back cover is definitely misleading. Most of the creams and lotions are time consuming to prepare and simply not practical (and definitely NOT easy!). I decided to return the book 1 hour after I received it from amazon.

The recipes are okay if you're just starting out, but her creams tend to be high on oil and low on water. I find that the proportions in her cream recipes don't work very well for my skin (but they could very well work for yours. Everyone's different). For this reason, I didn't rate the book very highly. There is nothing here that you wouldn't find in other more comprehensive books (e.g. Earthly Bodies, Heavenly Hair by Dina Falconi). I was also mystified by Ms. Byers statement that facial steaming was bad for everyone (or something to that effect). It has certainly been wonderful for my skin, although obviously, it is not something I would do everyday. I've also read in Beauty magazines that many supermodels steam their faces regularly. For the amount of money I paid for this book, I felt I didn't get very much.	2002-03-22

I am SO glad I bought it. Ms. Gladstar's personality, compassion and expertise are almost palpable in this book. You almost feel that she is right there beside you, gently guiding you as you move on your healing journey. I found, within the pages of this book, more understanding of my womanhood and its challenges and transitions and pains/discomforts those entailed, than I ever found in any gynecologist's office. It's clear from her books that Ms. Gladstar is not only a healer, but a gifted teacher as well. She is able to transmit the philosophy that using herbs is a way of life and not simply emergency medicine. I noticed that many of the herbs and recipes in the book (and every last one of her recipes is a therapeutic masterpiece!) use herbs that are fairly easy to find. No exotic weeds here! Her years of experience are evident in how well her herbal blends work. I'm thankful that a herbalist of her caliber is generous enough to share so much knowledge that has been refined and proven over the years.	2002-03-22

I am also very grateful for the generosity of the herbalists who shared their treasured recipes and health tips in this book. It's good to know that there are so many giving people out there. Even though I already know a fair amount about herbs (for a sort of advanced amateur, that is), I learned quite a bit from reading Ms. Falconi's little herbal at the end of the book (she focuses on the cosmetic applications of herbs) and the resource list is invaluable!

Reading this book is like walking into a house with treasures hidden at every turn. Unlike other herb books I've read, Rosemary explains how using herbs is not just a way of treatment, it is a way of LIFE. She explains how herbs can become a part of your nutrition, medication, beauty routine, garden and home. All her recipes work fabulously well. They have obviously been refined over the years and stood the test of time. Her little life anecdotes which appear scattered throughout the book are delightful, instructive and serve to draw you further into her world. Her resource list at the end of the book is extremely helpful. Thank you, Rosemary, for sharing your world and love of plants with us.

I was a bit disappointed. Although many of her ideas are good and innovative, it seems like she hasn't spent much time refining her recipes. The cold creams came out more like lumpy, bubbly goop, rather unnerving if you're expecting something like Ponds. Plus she doesn't tell you that if you opt to use the blender, you will spend an hour scrubbing and cleaning out the thing. If you want cream, the best recipe can be found in Rosemary Gladstar's Family Herbal (Rosemary's Perfect Cream). The Mermaid lotion in this book turned out like opaque white gelatin and felt like it too, although using Irish Moss as a moisturizer is a nice idea. All in all, it's an okay book for a beginner. The recipes I've tried, although disappointing in appearance and texture (and labor intensive, as far as cleaning up goes), perform reasonably well, so I guess that makes them okay. If you're going to give them as gifts, warn the recipients that they will look kinda weird, but feel okay.	2002-02-22

However, I still think this book is a gem. Most of it is devoted to resolving conflict with people whom you would like to continue a relationship with, but are somehow having trouble with at the moment. The author's strategies for dealing with friction in relationships is squarely rooted in Catholic spirituality. He counsels the reader to assume a positive intent behind even the most negative behavior, a loving and affirming approach in line with the treatment philosophies of other great therapists like Virginia Satir. He is also realistic in pointing out situations when the &quot;difficult&quot; person is someone with whom you should sever the relationship completely. Everyone who wants to resolve interpersonal conflicts in a positive way should read this book. It's also an excellent thesis on how to love one's neighbors (and enemies. They may well turn out NOT to be enemies after all, when you take the trouble to find out the positive intent behind the negative behavior and realize that their nastiness really has nothing to do with you personally). Good work, Mr. Popcak. Keep those gems of wisdom coming!	2001-09-11

This book is a manual on how to protect oneself on EVERY level. It begins by showing how to change a feminine belief system that has been so deeply ingrained in most women that we do not even realize how it controls our relationships, our ability to respond, our self esteem and ultimately, our safety. In order to be safe, we must first realize that we are strong and we can mount effective verbal and physical defenses against any assault. The information in this book is essentially what one would learn in a full impact self defense course. Although it does not take the place of full experiential (or what the authors call scenario-based self defense) training, it is a valuable introduction to it and a useful aid in remembering what one has learned if one has already completed such training. After outlining the steps to take in order to strengthen oneself mentally and emotionally, the concept of boundary setting is discussed and after that, there are very clear and graphic instructions and photographs for defending against a physical attack. Reading and doing the exercises in this book should result in a major transformation. You will significantly reduce your chances of ever becoming a predator's target, whether the predator is just a lewd, rude co-worker or a deranged criminal on the street (or God forbid, hiding in your home!). Every woman (and indeed, every decent person out there) deserves access to this information.

The nine chapters offer guidance in the form of questions that you ask yourself and reflect on when you are in the process of making a decision. The text is enlivened by little anecdotes of real people who had to make decisions that sometimes, were not very clearcut. Using the steps in this book, I have been able to see how God has communicated with me throughout my life. It has increased my trust in His concern and love for me and my family.

As I read the account of how children were damaged by the vaccine and how doctors and public officials reacted and tried to cover up the truth, I wondered, if these kids had been mice and the mice had shown the same symptoms after doses of the vaccine, would there have been any hesitation in implicating the vaccine? Probably not, because the conclusions are inescapable. In addition, there are no financial stakes involved in vaccinating mice. I am a highly trained scientist and I find that the questions and criticisms raised by the authors are valid. Their work here pertains to the whole cell pertussis vaccine, but I would suggest that parents raise the same questions about the acellular pertussis vaccine. One has only to read the package insert to learn that it is NOT a benign concoction, free from &quot;the side effects of the whole cell one&quot; as doctors will no doubt tell their patients. This book has shown that apparently, our kids' lives are not as important as the profits that drug companies could make, or the reputation of the medical establishment, at least in the eyes of the lawmakers who are responsible for making vaccination compulsory in this country. I salute the parents, doctors and other scientists as well as the journalists who had, and continue to have the courage to bring the dangers of many medical practices to the attention of the public. This book is definitely becoming part of my library.	2001-06-20

This Bible contains profiles of women in the Bible, suggestions on how to use them as prayer partners, articles on the biblical basis of Catholic practices, a lectionary and a subject index. The NRSV translation is a great choice. It's clear, features inclusive language where appropriate without detracting from the historical feel of the text. Using it will give Catholics (and especially Catholic women) a great appreciation for their religion and will deepen their spirituality. I gave it 4 stars because I would have wanted a more extensive index (I think all Bibles should feature a concordance at the end), but this Bible is worth having and worth USING!	2000-10-06

However I found the writing style leaves much to be desired. For one thing, I believe the  theoretical part (i.e. explanation of female cycles with all its hormones  and effects thereof) should have been the very first chapter. How else is  one to understand all the rules?  If the authors had done this, many of  the rules would be intuitively obvious. The theory should have been  followed by a quick &quot;overall&quot; summary of the rules and subsequent  chapters should then have dealt with all the little details, exceptions to  rules, causes of failure, etc. In the first couple of chapters, there are  constant references to subsequent chapters and admission from the authors  that they are &quot;getting ahead of themselves.&quot; Well, there is  absolutely no need to get ahead of oneself in a well organized and thought  out book. In spite of this there is also a lot of repetition! The authors  also use unnecessarily confusing terminology. Why call the phases of the  cycle Phase I, Phase II and Phase III when you can use descriptive names  like preovulational, fertile and postovulational (or luteal) phase? The  preachiness bothered me too. Although the book is obviously meant for a  Catholic audience, NFP is for everyone and readers (yes, even Catholic  ones) should not be made to feel guilty about avoiding pregnancy (i.e. as  opposed to merely &quot;spacing children&quot;). If one is considering NFP  as an alternative to artificial methods of birth control, she is to be  commended for that choice, not covertly castigated for not being &quot;open  to life.&quot; If you can get past all the authors' biases, preaching, etc.  there is a lot of important information to be gleaned from this book. The  references are also quite useful. One suggestion though -- if you would  like to learn NFP as quickly as possible and are not the least bit  interested in Catholic theology regarding birth control, read Toni  Weschler's book &quot;Taking Charge of your fertility&quot; FIRST (superbly  written and organized)and then read this book.  In their own way, the  authors have obviously tried their best to be very thorough and they've  managed to assemble a lot of very helpful information, especially for those  who are interested in the statistics of success/failure rates. Inspite of  all my criticism, I still think it's a good reference to have.	2000-05-14

I was very surprised to find out that this version of the Life Application Bible went out of print.  It's an excellent, clear translation and the notes are fabulous! The authors of the notes show remarkable sensitivity to  the fact that readers come from all walks of life and have had vastly  unique experiences. There is practically no denominational bias (apart from  the fact that the deuterocanonical books of the Catholic church are not  included). I am SO glad I bought this book when it was still in print and  now that it's out of print, I will guard my copy very, very carefully! If  you buy only one Bible in your life it should be this one.	2000-01-04
