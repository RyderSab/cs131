US	52287899	R76QJ7MWRNPL3	044661162X	77432495	Chasing the Dime	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A Connelly Fan:  This was a good one!!	I have read ALL of Connelly's works except for 2.  Connelly is exceptional! There is no doubt in my mind.  This was a book that kept you wanting more. Isn't that the point?  \\"A couldn't put it downable\\" as one critic said.  This book flowed nicely and the ending had excellent resolve.  I noticed the reference to a Pelecanos book \\"Hell to Pay\\" ( I just read it) I loved the reference to \\"Horton Hears a Who\\"  I thought that was an ingenious idea to use the verbiage of a childrens book as a theme for Pierces' scientific ambition.  There are references to Harry Bosch:  The Dollmaker and the artist Hieronymous Bosch.(Harry's namesake)<br /><br />For those of you ready for an exciting and quick read, I highly recommend this.  If you like Connelly, you will like this.  If you have never read Connelly, I bet you will be hooked after this one.	2005-01-25

I was really getting into it.  But then, I got to the end.  It seems as though Ms. Cornwell was under pressure to get this book done.  The ending was so anti-climatic.  I felt cheated.  The conclusions on the story line were so lame. There are so many factors to why this book is so disappointing, I don't know where to start. I have enjoyed all of the Scarpetta books and it saddens me to see such a feeble attmept to keep the series going.	2004-11-08

But after getting thru a good portion of it, I could not put it down.  Elizabeth George has an excellent way of developing characters and relationships as well as, developing the mystery and suspense and tying them all together at the end.  I am so hooked!!<br /><br />The Lyndley/Havers relationship is a story in itself.  These 2 get put together by their superior.  Havers has a history of not getting along with her partners and Lyndley has the reputation of being a philanderer.  They are put together to solve the murder of a farmer whose daughter was found by his side with blood all over her in an almost catatonic state.<br /><br />There is so many mini plots in the story but oddly enough, it is not difficult to follow.<br /><br />I can not wait to read the next one!!	2004-11-04

I was up into the early morning hours reading this one.  Lou Boldt is a detective in the Seattle area.  He is hunting a serial killer. They thought they had him at one point and even brought him into court.  He was shot by one of the victims fathers.  But it turns out it wasn't him. Lou is getting really stressed trying to figure out who the real killer is.  And bodies keep mounting up. With the help of his more than a friend psychologist, Daphne, they develop a profile for the killer.<br /><br />This is the first book in the Lou/Daphne series. It is awesome. Can not wait to read Angel Maker.	2004-10-31

I was taken a back by how well Pelecanos was able to paint such a vivid picture of the scenary and characters.  The story line was interesting and I liked how he went back and forth between scenes and tied them together at the end.  Strange is a retired cop who has an investigation business. He is asked by a dead cops mother to investigate the shooting that killed him to try and clear his name.  He involves the cop who actually did the shooting to try and figure out what really happened.  The investigation uncovers crooked cops, drug dealing and cover-ups.  Pelecanos creates an atmosphere that pulls you into the action.  Looking forward to the next one....	2004-10-20

I put it off, because I think I saw the movie.  I loved this book!<br /><br />I think the unique idea of the criminalist being a quadraplegic is phenomenal.  Deaver has reached high level.<br /><br />Rhyme is asked to help find a serial killer in Manhatten. What he is actually doing is putting off his suicide.  Amelia Sachs was the first one on the scene of one of the murders. Purely by accident. She was actually on her way to her new job in Public Affairs.  Rhyme is intreged by her because she stops a train and halts traffic on a major road.<br /><br />She is really not wanting to help on the scene.  But as she gets more involved and learns the personal side of Rhyme, she is pulled in.  She is good.<br /><br />This book is so good I actually wanted to find the old book mentioned \\"Old Crimes of NY\\". It also made me want to visit NY and study it's history...criminal history.	2004-10-18

I felt he chose a very controversial topic for the time and weaved it into a Spencer story very nicely.  He also showed his talent in character development, exposing Spenser's vulnerability and showing him as a sensitive, emotional guy.  Parker is also a master at humorous dialect.<br /><br />Spenser is asked to protect a lesbian who is touring around Boston giving speaches and making appearances after publishing a book that exposes discrimination of women (specifically gay) by organizations in the Boston area.  She has had threats against her life.  Rachel and Spenser do not always agree on how to handle situations which leads to her firing him.  And just after his termination of employment, she disappears.  Even though he did not see eye to eye with Rachel, I think he admired her and saw the emotion and sensitivity behind her abrasive front.  Therefore, he is determined to find her with the emotional support of Susan, his girlfriend.<br /><br />For those Spenser fans, I think this is one of his best and I am totally devoted to the series.	2004-10-12

This was an OK book.  To me, Clark is not in the same league as Connelly, Lehane or McGarrity.  However, I enjoy her plots and I like her choice of setting.  They make me want to visit the coast of New Jersey.<br /><br />This particular book was about Emily, a defense lawyer who buys a victorian style house which is in the middle of a history of murder.  Plus, she has a stalker still after her even though she thought he was put away in a mental institution.<br /><br />This book can be confusing if you don't stay on top of the characters and who is doing what.  That to me, is her downfall. Too many characters and too much going on at the same time.<br /><br />All in all, this book is enjoyable, it's just not one of my favorites.	2004-10-10

This was a great one. Couldn't put it down.  Krueger has proven he can compete with the big boys.  This takes place in a small Minnesota town on the fringe of a reservation.  Cork is trying to get over losing his job as sheriff.  Some strange murders are happening in Aurora and he is lured to the investigation.  In the mean time, he is also trying to figure out his personal life. He is attracted to a younger woman but is also trying to figure out what to do with his crumbling marriage.<br /><br />I liked the way Krueger developed the characters while keeping the reader hooked on the mystery. Not many authors have mastered this.  Krueger is working on becoming the master...	2004-10-07

Indians making a statement by death. Death to a number of notable figures from a slumlord to a judge and a welfare supervisor.  Lucas is hot on their tail.  But of course, he is also in the middle of his own drama.  Lily, the sexy NY cop he can't keep his hands off of. Even though his girlfriend Jennifer holds the key to his heart and his infant daughter.<br /><br />The story line is fine and keeps you riveted.  I think we could do without all the heated encounters between Lucas and his women.	2004-10-05

Connelly has a gift of pulling from previous books and developing top notch plots.  This book has Harry in the midst of a trial against an arrogant Hollywood show-off.  McCaleb, from Blood Works, is asked to look at a murder book on a victim who Bosch knows well.  McCaleb is lead down a road where Bosch becomes a prime suspect.  The 2 plots then come together at the end.<br /><br />I really liked the reference to the painter Bosch's pieces.  I found them very interesting.<br /><br />This story kept me on the edge...I was pleased with the resolution, however, the only thing that puzzled me was the ending.  I had to read the last 2 pages to figure out if there was something I missed....I hope I didn't.	2004-10-03

I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Reacher, an ex-military cop, is passing thru a small Georgia town and is falsely accused of murder.  He eventually is set free but he finds himself in the middle of a corrupt, organized group of thugs which includes the mayor and the largest business owner in the town.  Coincidently, this group of thugs has killed his brother.<br /><br />Reacher sticks around to seek revenge on the killers and figure out what led him to this strange place to begin with.<br /><br />Lee Child does a great job on this premier.  He has you at the end of your seat from the start.<br /><br />I am really looking forward to the next one of this series.	2004-09-28

Elvis Cole is hired to find this sacred Japanese book that has been stolen from a business man who had it on loan from a group of respected Japanese.  His job becomes more than just a hunt for a book.<br /><br />This is the type of book you could read in one sitting.  I like Elvis much better in this book than the first one. He isn't as sleezy.  The humor is witty and well timed.  Joe Pike, the silent and sleek partner, is a class act.  Highly recommend this book and I am looking forward to the next one.	2004-09-24

Kevin Kerney is on 2 cases and he is totally into his work.  He's a nice guy and has some good friends.<br /><br />The first story is about a lady who kills a cop because he raped her and her daughter.  A schizophrenic led Kerney to the killer.  But Kevin feels sympathy toward this lady who he feels killed for revenge.<br /><br />The second story is tracking down a theft of art right out of the governor's mansion.  This story brings in a big time criminal we saw in the first book, Telarosa.<br /><br />This is a rare book I could not put down. McGarrity has finally gotten the hang of it.

I think some of the reviewers looked at this book like it was one story. Short stories are so different.<br /><br />The first story was a bit confusing.  Not sure why the author chose to kill the character she did.  I'm still not sure of the motive, it wasn't clear.<br /><br />The second story was eerie.  It was almost like watching Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />The 3rd story was creepy. I still get chills thinking about all those rats. This was Steven King, Tales of the Crypt like.  Good story though.<br /><br />The 4th one was far fetched. Too many turns. Still not sure exactly how the guy died. The wife is pretty stupid to have been fooled all that time. I find it hard to believe her husband had all those secrets and she had no clue.<br /><br />The last one, I, Richard, was actually funny to me.  The dumb woman is the victor in the end. The  Richard part I am not familiar with, however, the story lines seemed to be similar.<br /><br />For short stories, these weren't too bad.  Not high on my list but I am glad I read them.	2004-09-12

I was skeptical about this one. Especially with all of the medicore to poor reviews.  I really liked this one. As a matter of fact, I think it is one of my favorites.  I think Cornwell did an excellent job in the suspense department. I was riveted.  It did take a while to get into this book. That is the only reason I rated this a 4.<br /><br />I foresee a change in Scarpetta's life after this book.  I think it is a good transition.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with this one.

I had just finished reading the Poet and was a little disappointed. Then I picked this up from the library.  I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of this one. Terry, a former FBI agent in LA, is retired and slowly getting his life together after a heart transplant.  HE is visited by a stranger who asks him to help find the killer of her sister. Little does he know, he is connected to this sister in an unusual way.  Against his doctor's advice, he starts investigating the murder which leads him on a journey of hard to find clues and speculation.  The story line is unique and flows nicely.  This is one of the best I have read all year.  If you haven't tried a Connelly, you can't lose with this one!!	2004-09-02

Spenser is funny and so cool.  I find my self chuckling through out these books.<br /><br />This one has Spenser trapsing around the world. Half way in, he has to pull Hawk in to help protect him from a gang of thugs.  Spenser was highered by a man whose family was killed in a bombing in London. He wants Spenser to find the 9 people behind the bombing and either kill them or have them arrested.  In true Spenser form, most of the group is terminated. Especially with Hawk in the picture.<br /><br />The final scene occurs in Montreal during the Olympic games where Hawk and Spenser have to take down a mammouth body guard.<br /><br />I really enjoy these books and can't wait to start the next one.	2004-08-29

In the mean-time, she is trying to find an old lady and then trying to find out why she dies.<br /><br />I have read some of the reviews here.  I liked the combination of the 2 stories.

I just hope with all the books Grafton has churned out, that I see some improvement.	2004-08-29

Another Great one from Ms. Anne	After reading some of the reviews of this book, I was a little concerned about it's content and whether I would like it or not.  Now I say to you \\"Monday Night Quarterbacks\\", what were you reading?  This was a wonderful book. Yeah, it's not a classic, but those of you who are familiar with Anne Rivers Siddons, knows that.  This is also not \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" and should not be compared to it.  To me, this is more about the characters and their stories.  I loved Nora.  She is spunky and not afraid to be herself and stick up for herself and what she believes in. She is also struggling with her past and tends to run away from it.  Peyton is an enjoyable character as well. She grew into a little lady before our eyes.<br /><br />I am a little confused as to the reason the housekeeper was referred to as both Clothilde and Chloe in the same breath. It took me a few pages to realize this was one person. I would love to ask the author why she did this.<br /><br />This is a little different than most of Anne's books but I still loved it anyway.  Well worth the read!!	2004-08-25

Tony is truly a notable character.  This book takes place in New Jersey.  Tony's former partner is murdered and Tony is there to figure out who did it.  The story is full of twists and turns but I especially like the character development.  Tony's relationship with his son is like a rollercoaster, he has a lot of interesting friends in NJ from his previous stint as a cop.  He falls in love with a pro-wrestler and his neighbor in Florida is a trip.<br /><br />This is the second book of the Valentine series and I am looking forward to reading the next adventure.	2004-08-23

I would have rated this a 5 until the last 40 or so pages.  Connelly should have gone with his first idea, not his second. I loved the characterization of the book, althought Jack was weak when it came to women.  The story line was very interesting. A killer on the loose, abuses and kills children, then the investigating officers supposedly commit suicide. Jack discovers a pattern and discovers these are homicides not suicides.  So he follows the FBI around, unwelcomed.  The story progresses nicely and builds up. But when the conflict starts to resolve, it unravels.  I was disappointed in the end but I still think it was a good book.  I'm still not giving up on Connelly since his Bosch series is fantastic.	2004-08-19

Meeting Dottie Frank was an honor. She is a spunky, interesting lady. I was certainly impressed when I went up to her and mentioned a phrase in this book and she repeated it word for word. (\\"my tongue had probably earned about 20 million Frequent Flyer Miles to rush my immortal impudent soul to a special torture chamber in purgatory\\")<br /><br />This book started out sad...mother dying, mean grandmother, rape...but after Anna moves out on her own, her life definately takes a turn for the better. I liked this book. However, the only confusing part was, some of the chapters were told through the eyes of the old next door neighbor. I don't think the idea was complete. I don't understand the significance of it.<br /><br />There was a reviewer who mentioned something about too much written about food.  What was she reading? Must have been on a diet. I don't agree.<br /><br />Another reviewer said something about the grandmother not being pertinent to the story. Couldn't be more wrong. Definately was pertinent.<br /><br />This is truly an enjoyable read with just a few flaws. It's worth the read.	2004-08-15

The story is about a very intelligent, very careful serial killer.  He is a lawyer and he is hungry for killing.  Lucas has a tough time figuring him out.  When he finally gets his first break, there are wild circumstances that get in the way of the catch.  Eventually luck swings in the right direction and the killer is caught but with a big stretch of the law.<br /><br />Lucas has a way with women.  I think Jennifer is a wench.  The only one I really had respect for was Carla.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a good read. Looking forward to the next one.	2004-08-07

To me, it was much better than the 1st (Tularusa).  This book was about family secrets, militia organization, pouching in the remote areas of New Mexico.  I really like the Kerney character McGarrity has created. The guy is tough and relentless but he also has a good heart.  I also like the choice of settting.  I am not that familiar with that part of the country. I find myself going to mapquest and locating areas mentioned in the book.  Can't wait to read book #3.	2004-08-04

Feinstein is awesome at holding interest with all of the excellent behind the scenes action of the life of an assisstant DA.  That is what I loved about the book.  I thought Alex's stint in London was a bit too long and really didn't have much to do with the plot.  But the ending is what got me. There was no surprise and not all of the loose ends were resolved.  The book went from a 5 to a 3 in about 10 pages.  I spent one whole morning reading the last 100 pages, couldn't put it down and then kicked myself for wasting all that time.<br /><br />Hopefully, Feinstein has improved her endings in the series, otherwise I'm going to have to give her up.	2004-08-01

It is an excellent dipiction of what happens in the \\"sex crime unit\\" as an assistant district attorney.  The story line was pretty decent as well.  Alexandra is an assistant DA in the \\"sex crime unit\\" in NY.  Her actress friend borrows her place on Martha's Vineyard and while she is there, she is murdered.  At first the authorities think the murder was mistaken identity (should have been Alex) but as it turns out it wasn't.  With a few twists and turns, the book continues nicely coming full circle at the end.  I am looking forward to the next book in the series.	2004-07-12

Pauline and Michael had a very tumultuous marriage.  This definately had an impact on the kids, especially Lindy.  The author did an excellent job painting the picture so you felt like you were watching their life play like a movie.  I think, after all that occurred, the marriage, the kids, Lindy leaving, the divorce, etc., Michael and Pauline really did love each other, they just were not good at the marriage thing.  The title of the book is perfect.  I would highly recommend this book!	2004-07-09

There is good action and the description of the southwest was good.  I just couldn't figure out where it was headed.  There were too many characters to keep track of.  And in some parts, you weren't sure where Kerney was or what he was doing.<br />I'm not giving up on this though, I'm going to read more. I'm sure he gets better.	2004-07-04

This was another I couldn't put down.  This isn't just a story of a cop in LA. This is a story of his life. How he handles his job and his personal life. Usually one of them is falling apart.  I have come to really like Bosch. I admire Connelly for his ability to pull in characters from the past and play them out. This book starts off with the murder of a high profile lawyer who was representing a man suing the police department for abuse.  It takes off from there.  Twists and turns you don't expect. I highly recommend this series.  They are hard to put down.	2004-06-30

It is interesting to see what topic he will use in the plot.  The first book, the setting was a college campus and a missing manuscript. The second one was a missing 14 year old and this one was about baseball.  Spenser is hilarious. A very likeable character.  The only thing I don't like about the series so far is the relationships with the women in his life. Too casual. Maybe it was a sign of the times (the 70's) but I feel like he uses the secretary and the school guidance counselor for a little more than sex and a good meal.  Even so, Im going to read more.  He intrigues me.	2004-06-27

Smart-ass detective, predictable plots.  So far, it's true.  You don't read these books for the plot, you read them for the funny antics of Spenser.<br />I am hoping these get better or I may have to stop reading them.<br />It's kind of like...ho hum another Spenser book.	2004-06-25

It was like watching a very suspenseful movie. Not only is this a good murder/mystery, the character development is exceptional as well.  I am anxious to read Prayers for Rain to find out what happens in the Angie/Patrick relationship. I highly recommend this author to those mystery/suspense buffs out there. You will put Dennis Lehane on top of your favorites list!	2004-06-22

I don't care what anyone says, this author just draws me into the plot and I can't put the book down.  Yes, she does seem to have the men in her stories become weak and worthless, but I love how she tells the story.  There are quite a few mini-plots that are intertwined and yet very light and easy to read.<br />I highly recommend this book	2004-06-19

Michael Connelly has developed a character who is real.  Harry loves being a cop. He has his flaws but he continually tries to improve himself. I love the way Connelly ties in characters and story lines from book to book. You definately have to start from the first of the series (Black Echo). I highly recommend this series.	2004-06-15
US	52287899	R3J3VFNTZ5E0LO	0385510187	818206773	Dating Dead Men	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Funny but convoluted	I was recommended this book because I have read (and loved) all of the Stephanie Plum series and supposedly this was along the same lines.  Well, the positive is this book is very witty and fun.  The sensitive character development, especially of Ruby and P.B., is heartwarming.  Now the bad part, this book was very hard to follow. I felt like everything was going off in different directions. One reviewer nailed it, it was like reading two stories in one. There is a certain amount of flow missing in this book. I recognized the author as an actress and I like her.  For a first book, not bad but hopefully she will learn from her experience and improve on her next one.	2004-06-11
US	52287899	RXZOHHNG0BSB5	0312958455	628100476	The Last Coyote (Harry Bosch #4)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Connelly continues to excel	I loved this book. The Bosch series just gets better and better.  I have come to really like Harry.  He is so real.  He is a great cop but he makes mistakes. The interesting thing is, he realizes it and always tries to improve on it while he continues to fight the demons that haunt him from his past and present.<br />My advice is, if you are going to read the Bosch series, start from the beginning (Black Echo). Each book pulls from the previous ones regarding characters and story lines. That's what makes these books so good. This series ties everything in and gives closure at the end.  It makes you want to read the next one...right away.	2004-06-01

I also felt like the character development was a little shallow.  However, I did enjoy the courtroom banter during the trial. The author did an excellent job of making the legal process easy to follow, with brief explanations along the way.  The book became more interesting and harder to put down as I got deeper into it. I would have preferred a bit more substance to the ending.<br />I don't appreciate one of the other reviewers giving the ending away. Not cool.	2004-05-21

These books have a lot of great suspense, action and mystery. The only negative is, these books have a lot of violence and sensitive subjects like ones dealing with child abuse.  I really like the way Lehane has developed the characters of Angie and Patrick. This book had a lot of developments in their relationship. Can't wait to read the next one.	2004-05-16

I thought it was a great set up for the 2nd book, if indeed that was the intent.  I felt like the author put a lot of thought into the characters, especially Lindsay.  I also was impressed with the mystery. I knew they were on the wrong path (at first) but I also wasn't exactly sure who the real killer was....	2004-05-16

This is a great heartwarming story of a married man who has been married to his wife for almost 30 years.  He forgets their 29th anniversery and the story proceeds to describe how he makes up for it in the mist of the preparation for his daughters wedding.  His father-in-law plays a role in this story as well. &quot;Noah&quot;, happens to be one of the characters in &quot;The Notebook&quot;, by the way.<br />This is a very uplifting novel. A must read!!	2004-05-06

It is one of the few books I have read lately that I couldn't put down. I enjoyed several things:  The relationship between Angie and Pat.  The bits of suddle humor that add flavor within each page.

I would have liked it a lot better if the romance was taken out of it.  It would have read a bit more intelligent.  Instead, it was more like a dime store romance novel.  And I agree with everyone who said it, people do not fall in love and marry someone so quick after losing their husband.	2004-04-12

For the first book by Connelly, this was exceptional.  Harry Bosche is a great character who loves what he does.  It was fun to follow the inner workings of his cop mind.  The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars was the ending.  It was somewhat unbelievable.  Nice twist though.	2004-04-08

However, I found I did not like the main character at all.  She is weak and selfish.  I found parts of the book unbelievable.  Like, this would not happpen in real life. I think some of the characters cut Carrie a break when they shouldn't have.  In a positive note to the author, if she was trying to get my attention, she did.The book has left an impression. But I can't say it is a positive one.	2002-12-29
