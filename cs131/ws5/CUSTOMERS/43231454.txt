The Hobbit is Bilbo Baggins and we follow his adventures as he journeys to the Lonely Mountain with Gandalf the Wizard and twelve dwarves.<br /><br /> It is a tale where Bilbo discovers that adventures aren't so bad after all, and the Dwarves discover that there is more to Mr. Baggins than meets the eye. Although the Lord of the Rings is a sequel of sorts to the Hobbit, the Hobbit is a children's book and is written in a much different style than LOTR.	2005-04-19

In this instance though, the film followed the book very closely. The villain has been changed from SMERSH to SPECTRE, but otherwise the plot is very similar (although Bond doesn't appear until a third of the way through), up to the last chapter. Much more espionage oriented than later films, where Bond becomes a virtual superhero, the novel is very fast paced and enjoyable, with memorable characters. The film is great, but do yourself a favour and read the book. I gave it 3 stars rather than 4, because the story is entertaining, it is somewhat slight.	2005-03-06

In this case the cause is a comet which hits the earth, causing massive tsunamis, earthquakes, and huuricanes. The comet also will change the earth's climate, causing a new ice-age.  <br />The book concentrates on a number of disparate individuals from southern California, before and after the disaster. Fortunately pockets of order do survive, but will they be able survive roving gangs, and the coming winter? Much of the compelling storytelling comes from examining how different people cope when civilization collapses and anarchy rules. Depressing reading when one realises how fragile our modern world is and how easily humanity can descend back into barbarism.	2005-02-21

The story continues closely after the end of Heretics of Dune. The Bene Gesserit are slowly transforming there home planet to replicate Dune in order to monoploize the Spice. But it is a race against time, their enemies the Honored Matres are closing in. And there may be even greater powers than either lurking in the Galaxy. <br />This was a disappointing end to the series. It is never clear why the Bene Gesserit are so inferior militarily to the Honored Matres when they are superior in every other way. The final showdown between the two was anti-climactic (what was the Honored Matres ultimate weapon? it was never explained) and the ending was little bit puzzling. Herbert ends this book pretty much as he ended the previous one, a small group flying away with a sandworm to start a new Dune somewhere else in the galaxy. And why did Herbert throw in those god-like beings in the story? That whole subplot didn't make much sense. <br />The series as whole was enjoyable for its scope, politics, religion and ecology, but it was never clearly written, leading to frustration at times.	2004-09-17

The tone is once again darker, bordering on the horrific (eg. Harry's punishment of 'writing lines'). It is another excellent story: long, without the slow parts of the Goblet of Fire, but without that story's terrifying climax. <br />Much of the book is Harry feeling frustrated by the willingness of people to close their eyes to the evidence of Voldemort's return. Instead Harry is branded as a publicity seeker and trouble maker. Although almost certainly not intended by J.K. Rowling, I find this to be a curious parallel to today's world where so many have their eyes shut to the dangers of islamofascism. <br />	2004-08-04

She is brutally murdered by her drug running pimp and most of the book chronicles Kelly's quest for revenge, interspersed with the CIA's attempt to rescue american POWs from North Vietnam. <BR>It's not a bad book, but for most part it is just a standard revenge fantasy.

The novels take place during the Napoleanic Wars, when all that stood between Britain and the armies of Napolean was the Royal Navy. How different the world might be if Nelson had not been victorious at Trafalgar.<BR>Patrick O'Brian very convincingly and in great detail immerses the reader into life on board a Royal Navy ship circa 1805. However O'Brian does not help out his readers much. I am tolerably well versed in history and geography, but I have to admit a map would have helped, and a little historical background wouldn't have hurt either. As for the nautical terms and jargon I was completely lost. But the story was entertaining and the detail of Royal Navy politics and shipboard life was interesting. It wasn't an easy read and although I'm sure I will read the next in the series, I didn't feel the need to seek it out immediately. Bottom line: if your interested in sailing or military history, you will probably enjoy it- others should steer clear.	2004-06-01

Lewis' Narnian chronicles. However the story-line has a gothic fairy-tale feel to it, with orphans battling wicked relatives, and elements of real danger and suspense. The story is short and tightly paced (perhaps a little too quick for adult readers who might wish for a little more depth) so children shouldn't find it too daunting.	2004-03-03

However her son has other ideas and Perloo finds himself on the run, striving to prevent a war between the Montmers and their rivals. <BR>What bugged me about this book, is that it tries to be edgy- characters are threatened with death repeatedly, but halfway through you know nothing the least bit unpleasant is going to happen. And of course after an ending that will have even children rolling their eyes, the bad guys are humbled and everyone else learns to live in harmony. Blecch.  It's too bad because there was some potential here. The sayings of Mogwart the Magpie were clever and the political maneuverings between Berwig and Senyous were welcome in a children's book.

But really how shocking could it be ? Well, A Feast Unkown is  so over the top in terms of sex and violence that it is almost comical. The story revolves around to heroes, the Lord of the Jungle (patterned after Tarzan) and the Man of Bronze (patterned after I'm not sure who). They both work for the Council of Nine, which govern and influence all human affairs, and supply the heroes with the elixir for virtual immortality. The two heroes have become mortal enemies as they duel to the death to take a vacancy in the Nine. <BR>As noted the book is full of violent sex and sexualized violence. It is not for anyone easily offended by explicit sex and graphic violence. In fact I'm sure the sole motivation behind this book was to see how many people Farmer could outrage. The sex and violence is so extreme that it becomes comical. And really beyond the efforts to offend there's not much here. Like a lot of sci-fi and fantasy novels from the late sixties - it is incredibly dated.	2004-01-05

Many classics just don't translate well in the modern world. Dracula does have some of those weepy emotional moments, so common to 19th century literature.  Also I am usually leery of stories told by the device of letters and diaries. However Dracula starts off very compellingly with Jonathan Harker's visit to Transylvania. The story drags a bit when the Count reaches London, but picks up after the death of Lucy. Unfortunately, the story never regains the creepy feeling of the beginning; mainly because the count remains a vague menace off page for almost the whole last two thirds of the book.	2003-12-17

The tone is very light and the reader is ready for a screwball adventure. But with the introduction of Gregory Persimmons the story turns darker. Persimmons has been searching for the Holy Graal (sic), and seeks to use its power to perform occult ceremonies. He believes it now resides in a country parish of Fardles. He resolves to steal it but is foiled by the Archdeacon of Fardles. As the struggle for the Graal continues both Persimmons and the Archdeacon gain unexpected allies. <BR>War In Heaven is reminiscent of CS Lewis' cosmic trilogy.

Spillane pictures them as a secret shadowy organization like the Illuminati or the Elders of Zion. <BR>The last Mickey Spillane novel in the omnibus Five Complete Mike Hammer Novels (and therefore the last Spillane novel I will ever read), starts as an improvement on the last three (which all seemed like a rehash of I, The Jury). However the ending is completely incoherent.  The fate of one character that had gone missing is never dealt with. One main characters' identity is proven to be false but it's never explained who she is. Spillane is, in common with a lot of the hardboiled genre, rather sparse on description and explication, but whole plot points are ignored or left unanswered.	2003-11-11

At Tours in what is now France in 732, in one of the most important battles of history, they were finally stopped by Charles Martel, but not before they had conquered most of Spain. The Arab culture of Spain was one of the peaks of Medieval civilization. <BR>Guy Gavriel Kay's The Lions Of Al-Rassan is set in a world remarkably similar to 11th century Spain. It is the struggle between the Jaddites (Christians) and Asharites (Muslims) with the Kindath (Jews) caught in the middle. The Asharite kingdoms are greater in wealth and culture than the Jaddites to the north, but they are becoming militarily weaker. Only the disunity of the Jaddite kingdoms prevents them from overwhelming the Asharite kingdoms.<BR>  The story revolves around three individuals, one Asharite, one Jaddite and one Kindath as they find common cause, for a while, as war and intrigue rage around them. <br />The strength of The Lions of Al-Rassan is its evocation of Medieval Spain, especially the grandeur of the Umayyad Caliphate of Cordoba. Its weakness is its characters. Everyone is just so wonderful; not just the three lead characters but almost all the secondary characters. They're all brave, charismatic, romantic, and so on ad nauseum. There isn't a real person in the bunch. <BR>However the novel is worth reading for its depiction of a lost civilization, squeezed between the Christians of the north and the Moors across the straits.	2003-09-16

Although often considered a children's book, it really takes an adult to appreciate Adams wonderful tale in all its manifestations. The book has many themes weaved through it: ecology, man's place in nature, the nature of primitive societies (the parallels between rabbit society and that of pre-agricultural man are many), amongst others. However perhaps the most important theme in the book, and one I would like to explore a little in this review, is the importance of individual freedom. <BR>The Sandleford warren is destroyed because it will not, can not by its very make-up, heed the warning of Fiver. It is only freedom that allows the individual talents of Dandelion, Bigwig, Blackberry, Fiver and especially Hazel to blossom; to leave the Sandleford warren, understand the dangers of Cowslip's warren and defeat General Woundwort and the Efrafans.<BR>Many have compared the Efrafa with Nazism because of its military character. I feel the parallels with communism are stronger: Woundwort as Stalin, Vervain and his secret police as Beria and the NKVD, and the Owsla as the Party. The lack of freedom, the show trials, the great Leader, are of course common to both fascism and communism. However the strict regimentation, the fact that no one is allowed to leave, and above all the justification that oppression is necessary for the good of the group; these are all hallmarks of socialist states from the Soviet Union in the 30's to today's North Korea.<BR>Please understand that these are underlying themes only, the book is in its essence an adventure tale, and one of the most enjoyable ever written.	2003-08-30

One day the whole town of Midwich falls into a sleep. When they awaken a day later, every woman of childbearing age is pregnant. Nine months later somewhat odd children with the power to control minds have been born.<br />This is a very interesting and frightening idea, but curiously, there is no suspense to the book at all. The characters just don't seem to react to the circumstances. Odd things happen and they just shrug their shoulders and go on about their business, resigned to their fate. And no one outside the village seems to notice! A major part of the problem is that the narrator isn't involved, he just chronicles what happens with a vague sense of disquiet, but nothing more. It makes you want to reach into the book and give these people a shake and tell them to wake up. Maybe it's a British stiff upper lip kind of thing, I don't know, but the result is a story that is interesting, but never involving.	2003-08-25

In Dune Messiah the complexity is the result of Herbert just not fleshing out the story enough. I've read the novel twice and I still don't understand exactly the nature of the conspiracy against Paul. Why the stoneburner if Duncan Idaho was programmed to kill Paul.

Many of the created societies in sci-fi feel one dimensional and antiseptic, but Frank Herbert created one of the most realistic and belivable futures in the genre. Dune was described in one of these customer reviews as what would happen if James Clavell wrote sci-fi. I couldn't agree more. It shares the same narraritive techniques as a Clavell novel, the same complex plot, and if Herbert isn't quite as entertaining a writer as Clavell, the ideas he presents are extremely fascinating.<BR>  Much of what drives Dune is two subjects largely absent from most science fiction: biology and religion.<BR>When I say religion I  mean religion as a social phenomena. In the few instances religion appears in sci-fi it is often presented in a smug or condescending way. But religion has been a large social force throughout recorded history and Herbert postulated, not unreasonably, that it will continue to be so.<BR>If it is not surprising that religion gets such short shrift, it is surprising how little attention biology gets in most Science-fiction. Authors conversant in PhD level physics often have no conception of the basic tenets of biology or ecology (though to be fair this failing is more pervalant in TV sci-fi). But in 'Dune' it is the ecology of the planet Arrakis that shapes the Fremen, and the religion based on Paul Maud'dib and jihad that shapes the galaxy.	2003-04-10

An explosion at Heathrow is called by the press an Act of God, and it turns out to be more than tabloid hyberbole, as Dirk Gently soon discovers.<BR> The feel of the novel is reminiscient of Thorne Smith's 'The Night Life of the Gods'. But although Adam's style is always enjoyable, the novel seems a little thin; all wit and little substance. Given Adams notorious bouts with writer's block maybe his publishers were unwilling to wait for it to be properly polished.	2003-04-04

The next day Hammer finds that 'Red' has been killed in a hit and run. He's convinced that it was no accident but murder, and vows revenge against those responsible.<BR>'My Gun Is Quick' finds Mickey Spillane in a rut. Once again a friend of Mike Hammer's has been killed and once again the private detective is out for revenge. In 'I, the Jury' it was a wartime buddy, in 'Vengeance Is Mine' it was another friend, in 'The Big Kill' it was an orphaned child's father, and now in 'My Gun Is Quick' it is a hooker with a heart of gold.<BR>Spillane was just going through the motions in this one. Half-way through the book you will already be able to guess the ending if you've ever read any other Mike Hammer book.	2003-03-28

Olaf Stapledon's Star Maker is a sequel of sorts to his earlier book Last &amp; First Men. Whereas L&amp;FM dealt with the fate and evolution of humankind, Star Maker concerns the fate and evolution of the universe. The unnamed narrator passes through time and space in an out of body experience, discovering the history of the universe both past and future, with the ultimate goal of understanding the nature of the Prime Creator- The Star Maker. <BR>Like L&amp;FM Star Maker is a book that is easily admired yet difficult to enjoy. The scope of Stapledon's imagination is astonishing. Yet because of its broad scope (literally billions of years of time and billions of light-years in space) it is by its very nature general, with little detail and much philosophy. This makes for tedious reading. And the philosophy espoused by Stapledon is Socialism. The theme running through the book is that only when the workers overcome their capitalist masters and control the means of production will a society be able to evolve a world mind -the next stage in galactic evolution. Those societies which do not will be consigned to the dustbin of history.<BR>This attitude is not surprising given when the book was written. WWI demonstrated the failure of monarchy, the Depression the failure of liberal democracy and capitalism. The choice seemed to many in the 1930's, a choice between fascism and communism. And Stapledon chose Lenin; to quote 'we were amazed to find that in a truly awakened world even a dictatorship could be in essence democratic' (Chp 9.1)That would be the Dictatorship of the Proletariat comrade.<BR>Politics aside, it is a seminal work in the history of the genre. It is an amazing work of imagination, even if  it does take a great deal of effort to wade through.	2003-03-18

This is the first and only Perry Mason story I have read. I've heard that the tone of these earlier works are a little 'tougher' than the stories written in the following decades. The first half of the book certainly follows the hard-boiled tradition, as Mason acts a more like a private dick than a lawyer. But a lawyer he is, and the second half settles into a court-room drama. What does Perry Mason have up his sleeve that will rescue a young lady and her new husband from charges of murdering her uncle to ensure her inheritance? <br />An enjoyable, light read, although Gardner's writing is a little pedestrian and the build-up to the court case is a little long, with the trial itself resolved a little perfunctorily.	2003-03-01

This is a tale of terrorists attemting to provoke a war between th U.S. and the soon to be defunct U.S.S.R.. <BR>Each book in the Jack Ryan saga gets longer and longer and Sum of All Fears needed some serious pruning. The book starts very slow, as Clancy describes in excruciating detail the engineering problems associated with making a nuclear bomb. In fact he spends two chapters describing, nanosecond by nanosecond, the process by which the bomb explodes! By the time we reach the climax it seems that Clancy realised he was approaching the 900 page mark and decided to wrap it all up in a couple of chapters. <BR>After four books in the series Clancy has introduced many minor characters, and his need for subplots involving nearly all of them add to the book's length.<BR>The other problem with the book is its scope. Jack Ryan helping a submarine defect is a manageable story-line. Jack Ryan saving the world from Armageddon is stretching things. <BR>Still I enjoyed the book. The subject matter is, if anything, more plausible today than when it was written 10 years ago. Clancy is unrivalled in describing the intracacies of geopolitical affairs. I just wish he learned to edit himself better. Judging by the size of the next novel in the series I don't think he has.	2003-02-21

Rowling was faced with a choice. Should the subsequent books in her series appeal to a new batch of young readers or change to appeal to her original fans as they grew older? Rowling has chosen the latter course. So each book in the series as grown darker in tone (and longer!) as Harry Potter and the targeted readers have grown and matured.<br />The Goblet of Fire starts slow, but picks up after Harry, Ron & Hermione return to Hogwarts, and hurtles to an 'edge of the seat' climax. The ending is a somber one, and it seems certain that the storm will break in the next book (which i hope will not be long in coming).	2002-12-12

However it feels more like a retelling of the same tale, as if Anne Rice was dissatisfied with her first vampire novel, and its protagonist Louis and decided to start over again with Lestat as the hero. So it chronicles the life of Lestat, who like Louis before him struggles to understand what it all means. And like the previous book there are lengthy discussions concerning Ehtics, Morality and Philosophy. However Lestat's mentor, Marius, is, fortunately, a little more knowledgeable than anyone was in 'Interview with a Vampire', and many of the reader's questions concerning the nature of Vampires is explained. <BR>I enjoyed this book more than the first; it wasn't quite as dry, and Lestat isn't the whiner Louis was. There is a little bit of discontinuity between the two stories; notably the character of Lestat has completely changed from the first novel (as has Armand), which an epilogue to the story doesn't quite fix.	2002-11-22

It's 2076 and the inhabitants of the moon (loonies) are planning rebellion from their Terran masters. Similar to Australia the Moon started as a penal colony, but because  the gravitational difference makes returning to the earth very difficult physiologically, any sentence is a life sentence. And not just the prisoners; workers and children born there also cannot live on the earth. For them the Moon is home and the Earth just a blue sphere in the sky. As a result the loonies have developed their own unique culture, and with the help of a sentient computer, hope to  gain their independence from Earth.<BR>  Another good effort from Heinlein, with the usual recipe of sociological and political musings mixed with a solid helping of engineering. Heinlein's creation of a lunar culture is excellent, and his ideas on revolution very fascinating.	2002-10-25

Richard Adams next effort, after the wonderful 'Watership Down', attempts to transfer the sweep and mythos of that book to a human arena with mixed results. A huge bear fleeing a forest fire stumbles into a poor backward island of Ortelga and is proclaimed to be an agent of God heralding a return to fortune for Ortelga. <BR>The book starts promisingly, but loses its sense of mystery and myth after a third of the story (after the conquest of Bekla). Adams has interesting points to make, mainly how a religion can be corrupted with even the best intentions. But its not done well enough to sustain the story...	2002-10-03

The main premise of the plot is based around relativity. The faster the ship goes, the 'slower' time becomes for the ship and its crew. With the result that the crew can travel immense distances in, what is for them, a few years time; and literally watch the universe age. <BR>This is an intriguing premise, but the book, short as is, reads slow. Characterization is not well done. The crew seems to come apart psychologically too fast. After all they knew when they started they wouldn't see Earth again, and would be journeying for at least five years. I just don't believe a handpicked crew, would panic and despair in a few years, even if the universe around them had aged hundreds of millions of years.<BR>And Sweden ruling the world?	2002-07-25

Cardinal of the Kremlin is a little more rounded than Clancy's earlier Jack Ryan books (Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games), as the character have much more depth to them.<BR>Also CotK is has more of a geopolitical angle than his others, with the consequence of having less action. <BR>Clancy, as always, is a master of describing the inner workings of Defense and Intelligence agencies, which I find fascinating, moreso than the technical details of equipment, for which he is also famous (or is it infamous? :)) . <BR>However the ending was very abrupt (especially compared with HfRO which seemed to have several). Still highly recommended.<BR>I can only guess that this wasn't made into a movie because of the smaller role Jack Ryan plays in this story.	2002-06-26

Much of Huxley's vision of the future is within our grasp: it is but a step from choosing the sex of one's babies to conditioning the physical and mental attributes of embryos; a step from the continual advertising bombardment of today to the consumerism of 'end don't mend', a step from TV to the feelies, a step from Prozac and Ritalin to Soma.<br />However Brave New World is not the terrifying vision of the future many make it out be. This is because Huxley contrasts his sterile, engineered society of the future with the grimy, superstitious society of the reservation. Huxley asks: is it better to have poverty, violence, art and freedom; or order, conformity, comfort and banality. After all happiness is still happiness even when produced by artificial means. The balance between order and chaos is a fundemental choice for any society.<br />All in all a thought provoking book, and therefore highly recommended	2002-06-26

It is the best of the first three, as with each book greater depth is added to Rowling's world. So in this book we learn a little more about Harry's parents, and the dark days during the rise of Voldemort.

Since there are already many reviews outlining the plot, I will just say how much I enjoyed it. Definitely a Childrens classic that adult's will enjoy as well. I do have a couple of quibbles though. Harry's treatment at the hands of the Dursley's seems very far-fetched. I know that this is a common theme in children's fantasy, but it's a little overdone. Secondly, Quidditch makes no sense at all, neither the concept(why just have one seeker, when you could have six?) or the fact that an assembly line broomstick (the nimbus 2000) should give one an advantage(shouldn't it be magical and athletic skill?)<br />But, all on all an excellent book (and the movie was good too!)	2002-05-10

However there is no adult dimension in this book. The characters are very simplistic. All the good characters are really, really good, and all the bad character's are really, really bad. Matthias turns from a bumbling novice to a skilled warrior and leader of the abbey's defence within a few pages. Children won't mind any of this and I heartily recommend it for them. Not in the same class as Watership Down,The Narnian Chronicles or even Harry Potter though.	2002-05-04

He finds that his quest is part of a greater struggle; between Law and Chaos, and that mortals are just the pawns of the gods. Along the way, he makes a bargain with a sorcerer, finds true love and confronts the ruler of the first five plane: The Knight of Swords. <BR>Not bad as swords and sorceries go, but the pace is very rushed. Better than Moorcock's Sci-fi stuff though...	2002-03-02

He is accompanied again by the eternal companion of champions Jhary-a-conel. Corum also receives the help of other heroes, which readers of Moorcock's other Eternal Champions series will recognize. <BR>This book brings the trilogy to a satisfying conclusion, but again the pacing is so fast that it has the effect of making the struggle against Chaos seem to easy for Corum, as he seems to get out of jams as fast as he gets in them, usually with supernatural help.	2002-03-02

In this book Prince Corum travels too a different plane to try and end the hegemony of The Queen of Swords, and thus save his own plane from the forces of Chaos. With him is the eternal companion of Champions,Jhary-a-conel and his winged cat.<BR>I don't know if this story was originally written for a magazine format, but it certainly reads like it. This is probably the weakest of the swords trilogy, and like all three books in the sword trilogy, the pace is breakneck. One has no time to appreciate the dangers Corum finds himself in, before he is immediately rescued and moved on to the next predicament.	2002-03-02

A Nebula was awarded to the third story 'Ill met in Lankhmar' and recounts the first meeting between the two heroes.
