Its wording is more straightforward, to-the-point, and sophisticated than the more average Context books such as Horsley and Silberman's The Message and the Kingdom, and Crossan's In Search of Paul.   <br /> <br />The first few chapters get to the point by defining Imperial Theology, Pax Romana, and Ruler Cult.  Subsequent chapters then readily demonstrate how the New Testament draws upon Old Testament political themes to principally stand as a rebuttal to the Roman Empire system, and only secondarily as an intertwined expression of religious, mystical, and religious-morality content.  Thus this book provides the ideal framework, on the canonical side, to identify the difference between New Testament Christianity and Gnostic-mystical Christianity, a comparison project which is today's main challenge as both the cultural context is being reconstructed and as Gnostic mysticism is being reconstructed.   <br /> <br />Books presenting the Context-oriented approach are generally a must-have in any library of Christian origins, but to get started the fastest in understanding the original intended audience of New Testament Christianity, start by reading the first few chapters of this book.	2005-10-06

Nitrous showed James the ordinary state of consciousness isn't enough for a full account of the mind. <br /> <br />Shanon critiques previous approaches to cognitive psychology, entheogens, and the mystic state and surpasses previous coverage of drug-induced mysticism.  He presents and calls for a sophisticated, well-informed phenomenological Cognitive Psychology approach to the mind and to the dissociative cognitive state and primary religious experiencing.   <br /> <br />He presents a research methodology, framework, and paradigm of extensive first-hand experience and training in the dissociative visionary cognitive state, with extensive comparison of experiential observations with many other experienced observers or trained practitioners, per Ken Wilber's Eye to Eye.  He demonstrates how the altered, dissociative cognitive state informs the scientific study of the mind, and how a phenomenological cognitive psychology perspective informs the scientific, systematic study of the states induced by visionary plants. <br /> <br />He approaches cognitive psychology as a concern with overall dynamic mental activity and phenomena, rather than underlying-level mental representation.  He critiques the established Psychology models of mystic-state experiencing, emphasizing that the visionary altered state affects and works comprehensively and non-specifically upon the entirety of experiencing and cognitive activity, including movement and performance, neither centered in uncovering hidden layer of already-ongoing sub-cognitive activity nor being restricted to merely the isolated faculty of imagination. <br /> <br />Antipodes opens a new era in research and theory on visionary plants and mythic metaphor.  Myths were discovered through the use of substance-induced alteredstates of consciousness; the world of myth is the world of entheogens.  Ayahuasca drinkers tend toward the universal metaphysical conclusion, of idealist monism: only interconnected thoughts exist. <br /> <br />Although noting Ancient Jewish mysticism used a Ayahuasca mixture such as Rue and Acacia or Mimosa, he emphasizes myths as metaphorical description of dissociative cognitive experiencing induced by visionary plants, not of the plants themselves like previous entheogen scholars.  Myth describes dissociative experiencing through small-scale mythemes and larger-scale structures, and represents mental transformation over multiple sessions. <br /> <br />Shanon's coverage of mystical phenomena is less developed and coherent than of imagery.  His categories of experiential phenomena and visionary metaphor don't cover the specifically religious-experiencing realm such as a willing sacrificing of kingship; he covers temples as merely a visual object, not really explaining why kings and temples are seen.  He covers control-instability, personal autonomy issues, and fear as though separate from religious/spiritual divine-encounter aspects.   <br /> <br />Practitioners fearfully cross themselves and pray for mercy before taking the Eucharistic potion.  Cognitive dissociation brings thought-control crisis in which reliance on one's own powers and resources is of no avail; to combat fear and restabilize mental control, trust is needed in something beyond one's local autonomous self.   <br /> <br />He advises mastering fearful thoughts and remembering you're an autonomous self who can influence thoughts -- yet asserts Ayahuasca drinkers feel the source and master of which thoughts happen isn't themselves, but external forces; it's scientifically unknown how thoughts originate; and the source of thoughts, control, and what happens in one's mind is not oneself, but a hidden, transcendent source. <br /> <br />Metaphorical descriptions of dissociative phenomena are also covered in Metzner's Unfolding Self; Culiano's Out of this World; Collins' Death, Ecstasy, and Other Worldly Journeys; Arbel's Beholders of Divine Secrets; and Thorne's Marihuana: Mysticism & Cannabis Experience.  Antipodes is a must-have for consciousness and entheogen researchers.	2005-09-10

His contributions abruptly halt there.  His theory of parallels, his interpretation of the ramifications of the parallels, and his underlying model of the motivations for the parallels are completely incorrect, off-base, and purely misleading -- he's on the wrong track there.   <br /> <br />This, by an author who has been a software developer, is one of those works that is like the memorable quip about the Apple Newton PDA (personal digital assistant): \\"It seems to have been made by a team consisting of a genius and an idiot.\\"  Because Carotta's work amounts to a useful inventory of parallels combined with a completely unsound interpretation of the ramifications of the parallels, because the book is completely distorted in such manner, the critiques of the book are typically distorted and off-base as well: they too are based on an entirely off-base model, theory, and interpretation of the ramifications of the parallels. <br /> <br />His useful inventory of parallels amounts to a set of data to be explained and fit into an explanatory framework.  His explanatory framework for the data-set he discovered is completely incorrect.  The following fallacies constitute his explanatory framework for the data in question: <br /> <br /> <br />o  The Jesus figure was formed by repeated accidental miscopying.   <br /> <br />Actually, the Jesus figure was a masterful deliberate creation.  This point aligns with Atwill's book Caesar's Messiah, showing why one must read multiple books, views, and perspectives -- each one a mixture of insight and misleading distortion -- to piece together a viable explanatory framework. <br /> <br /> <br />o  Jesus did exist historically.  He was Caesar. <br /> <br />Actually, the Jesus figurewas skillfully and deliberately crafted as a strategic modification of the divinized Caesar figure.  It is arbitrary and meaningless, misleading and a poor description of the situation, to say that since the Jesus figure derives from the Caesar figure, this amounts to the historicity of Jesus. <br /> <br /> <br />o  Jesus simply derives from a single figure, Julius Caesar. <br /> <br />Actually, the Jesus figure derives from around 100 figures -- combinations of real historical individuals, legends, mythic savior figures, mythic heroic figures, and so on. <br /> <br /> <br />o  The Julius Caesar life-story as written-up basically constitutes historical fact. <br /> <br />Actually, the Julius Caesar life-story as written-up constitutes a blend of elements in standard ancient and Hellenistic mode, in which themes from the political domain were deliberately intermixed with themes from the mythic and religious domain. <br /> <br /> <br />The essential weakness of the book has nothing to do with the soundness of each parallel Carotta lists.  Critics who attempt to disvalue the book on the basis of calling into question these claimed parallels are on the essentially wrong trail.  The real substantial and significant weakness of the book is Carotta's interpretive and explanatory framework that he presents along with the set of parallels he has discovered and inventoried. <br /> <br />A sound explanatory framework for the data Carotta discovered -- the parallels between the figures of Jesus and Caesar -- is that the Jesus figure was deliberately and strategically crafted as a figurative and allegorical response, understood and recognized as a figurative response, to how the divinized Julius figure was used for the Roman imperial sociopolitical system.   <br /> <br />The Jesus figure was created as a figurative response to how the divinized Julius figure was used for the Roman imperial sociopolitical system.  It is entirely off-base to couch the data in the explanatory framework summarized in the title \\"Jesus Was Caesar\\". <br /> <br />Jesus Was Caesar?  No -- not at all in the way Carotta describes.  Jesus was a figurative response to how the Roman Empire used the figure of Julius as justification for its sociopolitical system.	2005-05-13

She appropriately emphasizes and investigates this foundation of visionary plants, while providing a general model of Dionysian religion.  This book thereby provides not the final word, but the first adequate and appropriate starting-point for an accurate model of Dionysus and therefore of ancient religion.   <br /> <br />Taylor-Perry's routine and matter-of-fact, rather than defensive and fleeting, incorporation and investigation of visionary plants into her model is similar to the routine and no-nonsense incorporation, treatment, and handling of visionary plants in Ruck and Staples' book The World of Classical Myth.   <br /> <br />This study represents a milestone in progressing beyond the hesitant, defensive, and inadequate hypothesis of visionary plants in the single instance of the Eleusinian Mysteries, and moving into an essentially different phase of theory in which visionary plants are taken as routinely axiomatic and characteristically typical and definitive of ancient religion -- a relatively confident, assertive, and robust incorporation of the visionary-plants theory of religion, to an extent that can truly begin to form a viable and compelling, coherent, and integrated model of Dionysus and ancient religion.   <br /> <br />This is the main strength of the book, to absorb and incorporate the previous studies of Dionysus but firmly transfer them onto the more  coherent and solid ground of a visionary-plants basis, rather than treating visionary plants as a special side-topic and highly tentative hypothesis.  This book is definitely recommended as a valuable, worthwhile, and substantial addition to entheogen religion scholars and researchers of Greek, Hellenistic-era, and ancient religion.  The God Who Comes: Dionysian Mysteries Reclaimed is not only suitable for the canon of standard studies of Dionysian religion,but stands as a milestone in the development of the canon.	2005-04-23

He doesn't do a great job of describing that particular experience. He contradicts himself regarding the nature of that experience, making it hard to summarize his portrayal of it. Sometimes he characterizes that experience as a complete loss of consciousness, sometimes as pure awareness without mental content.     He's been reading too much Forman, who has an exagerrated near-exclusive interest in 'the pure consciousness event' at the expense of what Paper covers under the broad term 'ecstatic religious experiences'. Paper is basically consistent in his use of the broad term 'ecstatic religious experiences' and his super-narrow use of the term 'the mystic experience'.     Against Paper, cessation of mental-construct processing is interesting, but it is not in every sense the ultimate center of all value in mysticism or in the dissociative state of cognition. Cessation of mental-construct processing is a peak religious experience but it is a lack of balance and proportion to make an entire religion (model of mysticism) out of solely that one aspect, that one feature, of the dissociative, mystical cognitive state. The book has a lot to offer after, or if, you can tolerate this constant irritating violation of established usage. The dissociative state has myriad aspects and dynamic features, but Paper only intends a single aspect or feature every time he writes 'the mystic experience'.     He writes that \\"research on near-death experiences... incorporate many features of the mystic experience\\", yet he always defines 'the mystic experience' in too narrow of a way to allow talking of its \\"many features\\".     It requires two passes or attempts to review this book: one to remark on the annoying weird usage that narrows the term 'the mystic experience' down to a single particular experience, and another attempt at a review in order to critique that take on that particular experience and critique his overall contributions to the book. The book's overall contributions are blocked and impeded by the issue of Paper's bizarre and irritating super-narrowing re-definition of the term and construct 'the mystic experience'. He ought to use a more specific, less confusing term such as Forman's clear and explicit term 'pure consciousness event'.	2005-02-16

This is a large, beautiful, well-produced presentation of his findings to date, with up-to-date coverage of magic in visionary-plant shamanism and on the Web.  This book is a good model of combining clear, accessible presentation with scholarly references. <br /> <br />This book has widely comprehensive coverage of magic in the history of ideas, including myth; he treats magic in relation to religion, myth, Western esotericism, Gnosticism, alchemy, hermeticism, and astrology.  Mostly Western rather than Eastern practices, but Bon shamanism is covered.  Spans ancient and modern eras through the 20th Century.  Has stronger coverage of visionary plants than most books on magic, though more coverage is needed such as in Ratsch's book \\"Witchcraft Medicine: Healing Arts, Shamanic Practices, and Forbidden Plants\\", which raises the standard for covering this key subject. <br /> <br />I would like to see more explicit coverage of magic and myth as metaphorical double-entendres for the visionary-state phenomena.  I would also like to see more extended coverage of astrological determinism and magically or supernaturally transcending it -- for example, the index lacks entries for determinism, fate, heimarmene, and astrological determinism, even though the book does have some coverage of astrological determinism. <br /> <br />Because of the focus on the history of esotericism, this is a superior book on magic.  There is a little room for improvement in depth of profundity such as bringing together metaphor, ecstatic consciousness, transcendence, and cosmic determinism.  This book is among the better treatments of the history of magic, though not outstanding in its depth of grasp; its real outstanding strength is its comprehensive scope, the author's thorough and highly developed long-term familiarity with the material, and clear presentation.	2004-11-03

Pagan as Protestant v. Catholic	In the book Drudgery Divine, J. Z. Smith portrays Christianity and mystery religions in their late-antique phase as similar simultaneous parallel developments.  He emphasizes diversity in all the religions, against the monolithic assumption that underlies the usual project of comparing &quot;the&quot; Jewish religion, &quot;the&quot; Christian religion, and &quot;the&quot; Pagan type of religion.<br />Drudgery Divine is an expose of the biased and flawed nature of the Protestant, anti-Catholic project of portraying early Christianity as completely non-Catholic, non-ritualist, and non-initiatory.  This Protestant scholarly project was based on illegitimate approaches to comparison of early, pre-Catholic Christianity to the pagan/Hellenistic religions.  <br />The Protestant project sought to portray Christianity as far from ritual and initiation and mystery-religion as possible, and implicitly equated Catholic practices with Hellenistic ritual, initiation, and mystery, arguing that because pure, original Christianity was not at all like Hellenistic religion, original Christianity was not at all like Catholic Christianity.  <br />According to the Protestant scholars, original Christianity was completely unlike Catholic Christianity, being strictly a matter of revealed, not secret religion; being strictly a matter of straightforward rational ethics, not initiation and ritual; being strictly a matter of sermon study-lectures, not magic-like ritual practices; being strictly a matter of doctrinal principles of pure faith, not ritual activity.  <br />Insofar as the older Jewish religion could be portrayed as unlike Hellenistic secret ritual initiation, the Protestant scholars emphasized that real, original Christianity derived purely and strictly from the Jewish religion, as opposed to having anything to do with pagan/Hellenistic (read 'Catholic') secret ritual initiation.  <br />According to those Protestant scholars, the word 'mysterion' in Jewish writings has only one meaning to consider, and this meaning is purely secular, and simply connotes 'secret', and does not connote secret ritual initiation -- therefore, the use of the word 'mysterion' in original (which is to say, non-Catholic) Christianity had nothing to do with Hellenistic-type (read 'Catholic-type') secret ritual initiation.<br />Smith's book does not serve the purpose of putting forth an elaborated correct positive model of the nature of earliest Christianities.  Its focused purpose is to sweep away the bunk, biased, covert project driven by anti-Catholic concerns, to enable the next generation of scholars to completely re-approach the question of the relationship of early Christianity to Hellenistic religion, including an adequate treatment of multiplicity within Christianity and within the other religions, and development over time.  <br />He points out that some kinds of Christianity were similar to some kinds of Hellenistic religion.<br />One of many tenets of the Protestant project of comparing original Christianity/Jewish religion against Hellenistic/Catholic religion, Smith briefly points out, is the idea that the Jewish religion was completely unlike secret ritual initiation.	2004-06-05

Historical Jesus scholars assume Christianity began in Palestine and spread from there.  They put their theoretical feet too firmly in Palestine, when Christianity was actually a product of the Hellenistic urban world, which somewhat violently took over the old, thus respectable, Jewish scriptures to give credibility to the new, Christian religion.  <br />Rieser has his theoretical feet firmly planted in the urban Roman empire, with an emphasis on my favored period of 70-313 CE, with a bit of focus on the pivotal change after that as the Christian religion became officially accepted and then co-opted and mandated by the same kind of power hierarchy it was originally designed to resist.<br />Rieser recommends we study the detailed socio-economic realities of Palestine as a backdrop for religious, pseudo-historical, edifying political fiction.  He shows how Christianity was started by the Jews of the Diaspora.  It was soon taken over and fully Hellenized by the lower class throughout the Roman Empire (with an increasingly artificial Jewish veneer).  <br />Christianity arrived last, not first, in Palestine -- that's why Christian archeological finds appear in Rome but not in Judea until the fourth century.  Jesus, the Apostles, and Paul are entirely fictional, though loosely based on types of actual individuals. Christianity was initially started by Jews, though these were the very heavily Hellenized Diaspora Jews, not the less-Hellenized Jews in Palestine.  <br />The heavily Hellenistic communities gradually invented and pulled together the pseudo-historical single figure and retroactively set him into the pre-70, Palestine backdrop.  <br />Once you abandon Historical Jesus -- and Historical Apostles and Historical Paul and that whole way of thinking -- many superior theoretical options open up for understanding the early Christian religion in terms of a mythically allegorized socio-political counter-religion to the hierarchical honor-hyperinflating system of divinized Caesar.  (I would point out that it also opens up the researcher's ability to think of earliest Christianity in terms of mythic allegory that describes and conveys primary religious experiencing.)<br />Christianity was almost immediately co-opted by the gentile lower class of the large cities of the Roman Empire, especially Rome, Alexandria, and the cities of Asia Minor (just to the east of Greece, including Byzantium/Constantinople), with increasing animosity between the Hellenists and Jews.  The Hellenist lower class found the Hellenic transformed version of the Jewish Diaspora messiah religion to be useful politically.<br />When Christianity finally arrived in Palestine, the Jews there shunned it as alien, unfamiliar, and just another attempt to invade and corrupt Israel with Hellenism.<br />Rieser mentions the central importance of sacred meals in mystery religions and mentions Jesus as the &quot;drug, or pharmakos, of immortality&quot;, but has no insight into entheogenic experiential allegory.  Why would wine and bread deserve to be placed at the center of any Hellenistic religion?  Historical and socio-political treatments such as this tend to completely omit religious experiencing from their theory of Christianity.  <br />They assume that the ritual makes the eucharist or sacrament seem potent, rather than vice versa.  Though Rieser explains how the Hellenized transformation of the messiah story was politically meaningful and useful to the Hellenes, he doesn't mention that it was also fully amenable to allegorically expressing the standard core mystery-religion with a storyline that is fictionally set in Palestine rather than in the mythic realm as such.  <br />Instead of a story about a mythic Prometheus chained to a rock, or a mythic Attis tied to or encased in a tree trunk, or Isaac bound to the altar, the pseudo-historical Jesus figure is fastened to a cross, just like (as Rieser states) the actual rebel slaves and underclass in Rome or in Judea.<br />Rieser has only passing, shallow coverage of the mystery religions.  But if the Hellenistic mystery-religion mythic storylines were intended to describe the initiation experiences encountered by the mystery-religion initiate after consuming something sacred, the pseudo-historical Jesus storyline may also be experienced firsthand after the Christian initiate partakes of a Last Supper before entering the kingdom of God that is revealed when time ends.  <br />Rieser provides plenty of hooks for such an explanation, but, like almost all the overly historical-oriented modern researchers, is unable to treat this experiential allegory dimension which calls out for coverage.<br />Rieser reduces religion to the socio-political realm instead of recognizing the overlaid, richly interpenetrating layers of political allegory and mystic-state experiential allegory.  The mythic-only Christ theorists Freke and Gandy, conversely, explain experiential initiation in the original Christian religion, in The Jesus Mysteries, and in Jesus and the Lost Goddess, but omit the socio-political layer of allegory.  <br />The socio-political perspective without mystery-religion experiential allegory is less than completely convincing, because it implausibly omits Hellenistic-style primary religious experiencing from early Christianity.<br />Rieser's plausible and realistic view of the Roman Empire and the changing Hellenistic/Jewish relationships is still ahead of current research in the U.S.  Every Christian-origins scholar should read The True Founder of Christianity and the Hellenistic Philosophy.  Its style, perspective, and sensibility are valuable and it makes an essential contribution to the field.<br />See also Rieser's book Messianism and Epiphany: An Essay on the Origins of Christianity.	2004-02-24

Dave Hunter's books are closer to what's needed.  This book is ok to add to a collection, but not the first book to get.    The accompanying CD sounds bad. After gathering articles about genuine star guitar rigs, one editor poured his time and energy into making a so-called sample CD -- using an amp simulator.  The CD tracks provide fake, incomplete, half-baked Tone at best. It misleads and misguides beginning guitarists to make them think that this non-range of non-Tone is worth recording.  These tone samples are mediocre at best; instead, Dave Hunter's CDs with his good books set a proper standard.    Why would anyone ever choose to listen to this fake sound when they could easily put on a genuine, rich sounding record instead? It's misguided to use the opposite of Tone, to create a CD that is marketed as showcasing the goal amp sounds, including actual power tubes and bona fide speaker distortion, which are explained to some extent within the book.    What this CD ends up demonstrating is negative: why your tone is doomed to sound like a total uninspired amateur and poseur if you use an amp simulator rather than actual power tubes and hard-pushed guitar speaker. The CD perpetuates the divide between kids' gear and adult gear (per the Damage Control founders who broke off from Line 6 corporation).  Actual cranked amps are essential to the qualifications of the guitar gods.    This sample CD could be a boon to amp tone, by steering people away from amp simulators, jolting some good sense into them to run out and get instead an actual miked-amp setup, such as a tube power amp and a guitar speaker, possibly in an isolation booth.	2003-10-11

Even in Germany you have to look for Drews' books in antiquarian libraries.<br />There was a pope Peter on the very Vatican a long time before Catholic papacy became into being.  From another reader's translation of this book into English: &quot;No doubt: the Christian Peter is nothing but a reduplicated and humanized Persian Petros or Mithra, who got that way into the Gospels. The papal Church is nothing but the immediate continuation or the Christian substitute of the old Petros cult. The Archigallus, the highest priest or pagan Pope of the Mithras-Attis cult corresponds to the highest or archpriest of the entire Catholic Christendom. He had his residence on the Vatican, worshipped the Sun as Saviour and in the Kybele the 'virgin'-Godmother, who would be represented sitting with a baby boy on her lap having the Virgin Mary as her Christian counterpart.&quot;<br />Drews provides a substantial scholarly basis for understanding that the Bible is essentially all mythic or, as I'd emphasize more, mystic allegory.  A must-have for all mythic-only Jesus scholars, because eliminating the hypothesis of a single historical person underlying the Jesus figure goes hand-in-hand with doing the same for the rest of his crowd: Paul, Peter, John, James, Mary, and all the apostles.	2003-09-02

Similar to Freke & Gandy's book The Jesus Mysteries and its companion Jesus and the Goddess, and unlike Doherty's book The Jesus Puzzle, Acharya not only makes a case for the nonhistoricity of Jesus and absence of a single individual as the kernel for the Jesus figure, she also proposes an interpretation of what, positively, the original Jesus figure meant to the earliest Christians and proto-Christians.      Her presentation of the case for the negative half of the project, debunking the historicity of Jesus, is good, is standard, and strengthens the case made by the other mythic-only Jesus scholars.  By providing a positive scenario of the real, original, esoteric meaning of Jesus, in addition to debunking the received history, Acharya is more ambitious than Doherty.  However, her proposed explanation of the Jesus figure as a matter of initiation, myth, and esotericism is a 1-dimensional, literalist, materialist, and debased version of astrology.      She conceives of astrology as a study of physical bodies rather than as being also an allegorical system of psyche development grounded in the mystic state of consciousness.  She thus misreads the nature and spirit of that which she proposes as a replacement for Jesus' historicity, astrology.  Freke & Gandy have a better feel for the psychological and mystic-state emphasis in esoteric mystery initiations and myth.      Her lack of recognition of the mystic-state psychology emphasis in astrology is all the more remarkable because it contrasts with her own short section about visionary plants.  In that section she again uses the term 'initiation', but doesn't describe what initiation is about.      That section on visionary plants is also oddly not integrated into the rest of the book, because it states that the 'Jesus as Amanita' theme was merely one aspect of the Jesus myth and Christ conspiracy, which incorporated virtually everything at hand.  If this isolated, insightful statement of Acharya is correct, it contradicts, as too limited and too literalist, her own proposed positive explanation of the real original meaning of Jesus in the rest of the book, which she consistently portrays as strictly meaning the literal, physical sun within a conception of astrology that knows nothing of the divine experience of the bright mystic sun in the psyche during initiation.    Thus her book contains the necessary elements to portray astrology as a series of psychological, mystic-state initiation experiences integrated with external materialist, cosmological teachings, but she doesn't put the pieces together.  Instead, the bulk of the book consistently portrays literal cosmological bodies as the only concern of astrology -- against all scholars of Western esotericism, who are unanimous that astrology is at least as concerned with nonordinary experiencing and divine development of the psyche, as with physical cosmological bodies.    This is an ambitious and at times overambitious book in that Acharya is unable to put forth a coherent and compelling positive explanation of what the Jesus figure originally meant in its cultural context.  She fumbles the ball of esotericism, reducing it to a materialist, that is, non-psychological and non-mystical, conception.    She also misportrays the character of mythic and mystic thinking in ancient wisdom traditions in that she portrays astrology as an isolated esoteric sacred science.  Fideler's book Jesus Christ, Sun of God: Ancient Cosmology and Early Christian Symbolism provides a more accurate, multifaceted view of how astrotheology functioned as one esoteric thematic school among many.    I especially applaud her revealing that the Paul figure is not historical.  More research is needed here, following the lead of the 19th-Century Dutch Radical Critics.    In the last chapters of the book, Acharya commits the common fallacy of postulating an ancient and materialist origin of religious ideas, rather than recognizing that religious ideas spring from the ever-available mystic altered state of consciousness.  Because the origin of the ideas in psychological experiences during the mystic state isn't recognized, such nonmystical scholars as Acharya only have recourse to one type of explanation: a literalist, materialist, non-psychological historical origin of religious ideas.  She relies too heavily on a single type of scholar, such as Doane in the 19th century, before Jung; she seems unaware of the Jungian or mystic-state theories of the origin of mythic thinking.      The only way she could succeed at convincing skeptics of Jesus' nonhistoricity is by providing a fully compelling positive alternative of what the mystic Jesus figure originally meant.  In proffering a materialist version of astrology, she needs to state her position on the Jungian subconscious or mystic state psychological phenomena as an explanation for the origin of the mythic Jesus figure.    This is a highly readable book for a popular audience.  Those wanting a more scholarly convincing argument should also read Doherty's book The Jesus Puzzle.  Those wanting a more insightful characterization of ancient astrology as psyche-centered should also read Fideler's book Jesus Christ, Sun of God, and those wanting a more experiential characterization of mystery-religion initiation should also read Freke & Gandy's books The Jesus Mysteries and Jesus and the Goddess.    The goal of the book is to establish was Jesus wasn't (a historical individual serving as the kernel for the eventual Jesus figure) and what Jesus was.  It is stronger on the first project than the second, because what Jesus was was -- as she states in one isolated spot but otherwise neglects -- a composite figure formed from many themes, not just from a physicalist type of astrology.      The goal of such a revised and corrected understanding is to change popular and scholarly understanding of the original meaning of the Jesus figure, which will then help prevent a continuation of the destructiveness that is supported by a literalist misconception of Christianity.  Acharya only partially achieves this goal of providing an accurate understanding of the original Hellenistic meaning of the Jesus figure, and thus this book is of limited efficacy in switching the world away from a literalist to a truly esoteric comprehension of Jesus and Christianity.	2003-08-27

It is well-written and scholarly.  The field is inherently speculative at this early point.  This is a much-needed valuable contribution to religion studies.  <br />Today's situation is a perfect example of a paradigm shift: if you examine each hypothesis separately and each book on the subject separately, and assume the dominant paradigm or non-theory of \\"those crazy and primitive ancients are simply unfathomable and alien to our way of thinking,\\" you'll be able to easily dismiss each hypothesis and each book.  <br />But when you consider the still-small set of all books and articles about the entheogen theory of religion, a viable alternative paradigm is coming into view.  This new paradigm, within which Merkur is only one of a growing number of researchers, is readily yielding specific plausible hypotheses, while the official dominant view has no hypotheses other than \\"the ancients' minds operated differently than ours, and we simple can't comprehend them, and they were remarkably excitable by wine -- lightweights, unlike us.\\"<br />Therefore, any one book in this field cannot be reasonably evaluated in isolation; instead, read Merkur's book Psychedelic Sacrament, Clark Heinrich's 1995 book Strange Fruit, which also has coverage of ergot in the Old Testament, and several other books in the field of the entheogen theory of religion.  Only then are you reasonably equipped to assess how much this book contributes to our understanding of the history of religion and the nature of religious experiencing.	2003-07-01

Heinrich presents a fine and sufficient candidate. <br />He also presents a brilliant hypothesis that the story of the Exodus is based around ergot poisoning of the yeast supply. <br />To better reveal what an innovative coverage and approach the book provides, it would've benefitted from a detailed table of contents, more section subheads, and clearer chapter titles.<br />Chapters and their coverage of Amanita encoding:<br />A Brief Explanation of an Unusual Book -- defining speculative history approach and encoding of visionary plants in myth-religion<BR>Beating around the Burning Bush -- drug use in religions (\\"& myth\\") (short)<BR>The Soma Drinkers -- Vedic Aryans<BR>The Fly Agaric -- effects of Amanita<BR>Curious Evidence -- Soma, Allegro<br />The Dwarf Sun-God -- Vishnu, Krishna<BR>The Red-Eyed Howler -- Rudra/Himalayas, Shiva, Hanuman, Tantra<BR>The Secrets of Eden -- Story of Garden of Eden<BR>The Prophets of Ancient Israel -- Abraham, Moses, ergot exodus, Elijah, Elisha, Song of Songs, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jonah<BR>Living Water and the Bread of Life: The Story of Jesus -- Jesus, Paul, Revelation<BR>The Knowers of God -- Gnostics<BR>The Mysterious Grail -- Holy Grail<BR>Elixir: The Secret Stone of Alchemy -- Alchemy<BR>An Artistic Conspiracy? -- Renaissance art (short)<BR>Heaven and Hell -- author trip reports<BR>Last Word -- summary of reasonableness of entheogen encoding in religions/groups discussed<BR>Legend of Miskwedo -- American Indian<br />I commend how Clark Heinrich's book is structured to trace the presence of entheogens, particularly Amanita, through history, with Alchemy serving to represent the Renaissance period and Western Esotericism.<br />This is an improved second edition of the excellent book \\"Strange Fruit\\".  The original title was Strange Fruit: Alchemy and Religion: The Hidden Truth: Alchemy, Religion and Magical Foods: A Speculative History.<br />\\"A speculative history\\" is important: Heinrich is tracing the Amanita through Western history of myth-religion, and approach that is needed more, as we fill in the presence of visionary plants in all eras/areas/groups/religions/systems of gnosis & forms of the perennial philosophy.  <br />The pair of separate terms \\"religion and alchemy\\" obscures what his \\"speculative history\\" approach implies: there isn't in fact \\"religions\\" over here and \\"alchemy\\" over there as something set apart; neither is the \\"myth vs. religion\\" distinction helpful.  The book actually contains a more full-fledged history, rather than just \\"religion\\" and \\"alchemy\\" -- Western Esotericism is covered not only by Alchemy, but also by the Holy Grail.<br />Some say Heinrich makes the error of seeing Amanita everywhere.  On the contrary, entheogen scholarship only errs in failing to see visionary plants everywhere, wherever the perennial philosophy is present, whether called \\"philosophy\\", \\"gnosis\\", \\"religion\\", \\"myth\\", \\"magic\\", or \\"Western Esotericism\\".  <br />Further research is needed, such as in Entheos journal, to fill in the remaining areas left after Heinrich's book, so that we at last recognize and come to see visionary plants everywhere -- in all these traditions or currents.<br />The book's \\"speculative history\\" approach implies coverage of finding visionary plants everywhere and finding that this \\"everywhere\\" is really just one single \\"place\\": manifestations of the perennial philosophy, or gnosis, which is universal.<br />The book tends to write in a voice which assumes the existence of a single individual who was the kernal for the Jesus figure, but Heinrich also points out that we have no evidence justifying a conclusion that such an individual existed. He portrays Jesus both as hierophant administering Amanita and Jesus as Amanita. He provides a fair commentary on John Allegro's contributions to recognizing Amanita in Christianity.<br />The book tends, like most entheogen scholarship, to treat the visionary plants themselves as the entirety of what is revealed, when in fact the gnosis itself, the principles of the perennial philosophy, are certainly the other half and perhaps ultimately the main half of what is revealed -- though in practice, revealing the visionary plants is tantamount to revealing the perennial philosophy.<br />Heinrich is innovative but not alone; this kind of entheogen scholarship has become a burgeoning approach and school of thought -- an increasingly standardized and established, productive research paradigm. Chris Bennett's book Sex, Drugs, Violence and the Bible makes a case for cannabis and other visionary plants in the Bible. Dan Merkur's book Mystery of Manna contributes additional arguments to the case for ergot in the Old Testament.<br />This is a model of a fine book. The prose is clear, artistic, and masterful. The photos are stunning and perfectly support his case, showing the shape-shifting Amanita in its various lifecycle stages, explaining how each stage is allegorized in Hindu, Christian, and alchemical traditions. A must-have for entheogen scholars.	2003-05-14

It is turgid, and scholastic, and should be read while keeping in mind the skeptical cautionary points in Michael A. Williams' book Rethinking 'Gnosticism'.      The 2nd edition has an added chapter which distorts the subject matter by forcing it through a lens of mid-20th Century existentialist and academic-styled expression; that chapter converts the gnostics into 1950s existentialist academic dissertationists.      Several more recent books have been written to provide a clearer, more straightforward introduction to this subject, including \\"Gnosis: The Nature and History of Gnosticism\\" by Kurt Rudolph, and \\"Gnosticism: New Light on the Ancient Tradition of Inner Knowing\\" by Stephan Hoeller.	2003-04-20

Mary Magdalene is often replaced by Mary mother of Jesus, who then is passive and affirms Peter's authority.  The Peter figure is consistently elevated in writings that promote hierarchical, male, formal authority such as Deacons, Bishops, and Archbishops.<br />The Mary Magdalene figure is consistently elevated is writings from which formal leadership roles are absent.  The Paul figure is more involved in a tug-of-war between these two opposing systems of church government.  <br />Brock tends to speak as though taking for granted the historical existence of the Bible figures -- that may or may not be excusable.  Those who wanted to concentrate power exclusively in the hands of the leaders of a hierarchical church had good reason to literalize all the Bible figures, whereas I would expect the democratizers such as elevated Mary Magdalene as authoritative would be inclined to democratically put forth the whole scheme as mythic-mystic metaphor.<br />I would like to see this motive for literalization treated and possibly contrasted between those who elevated the figure of Mary Magdalene (women, mystics, and those not in power) and those who elevated the figure of Peter (male Roman rulers).<br />Brock demonstrates that among the gospels, Luke is the most pro-Peter and most pro-hierarchy, promoting the narrowest and most formal concept of &quot;apostle&quot;.  The whole idea of a firmly restricted number of &quot;apostles&quot; aligns with the motives of the Petrine camp and is against the spirit of the Mary Magdalene camp.  <br />I am still trying to understand whether this book postulates that Christianity began as a women-driven religion that was later taken over by the men in power; whether Mary Magdalene is practically the same as the Beloved Disciple and the traditional figure of &quot;John&quot;; and whether Mary Magdalene should be thought of as the mythic consort of the godman figure in the Christian system of mythic-mystic religion.<br />This is a solidly scholarly work that greatly advances Mary Magdalene studies and shows the importance and full relevance of Mary Magdalene.  Before reading Brock, I was inclined to think that because the Mary Magdalene early tradition has been largely suppressed in the canon, a theory of the core Christian mythic-mystic system need not cover her.<br />Brock clearly reveals the importance of tracing in the canon the boundaries of this battle for authority between the democratic and hierarchical camps.  To a significant extent, the canon is intrinsically shaped in the form of a conflict and contention between the two camps; the canon reflects a great tug-of-war between two main scripture-shaping camps, and cannot be meaningfully understood when approached as a single, coherent, harmonious construction.  <br />Brock opens up the canon by demonstrating that it reflects opposing efforts to define the structure of the church, the content of Christian doctrine, and the socio-political role of women.  The scriptures can be rightly divided, putting aside the familiar Petrine authoritarian tradition which was convenient for the Roman rulers,  and freshly opening up the democratic direct experience associated with the Mary Magdalene camp.  <br />I would like to see more about the association of direct mystic experiencing with the Mary Magdalene advocates.  This book is more concerned with establishing the evidence for its specific, delimited thesis that there was a struggle for authority, than with speculating about the motives and mode of operation of the Orthodox authoritarian Christians (bishops and other powerful, elite rulers) against the Gnostic Christians.	2003-04-02

Aside from some distracting typos, it is highly readable and reveals how interesting and complex many of the Bible stories are.  As is standard, it assumes the literal existence of Bible characters -- an assumption which entheogen scholars are increasingly calling into question.  <br />I'm grateful for this book spurring me on to take on studying all the books in the Bible.  Highly recommended for entheogen and religion collections -- essential, in fact, especially in light of how few books there are about entheogens in Christianity.	2003-03-29

This book would benefit by being more emphatically aimed at the guitarist, particularly the guitarist who wants good amp tone in a home recording studio.  There are currently two other books about recording the electric guitar.  The book The Recording Guitarist by Jon Chappell has a more relevant perspective and is the longest, with the greatest number of helpful tips.  Recording the Electric Guitar: It's All About Tone by Jon Bare is the same length as the present book, but comes with a CD that carries great authority by using real examples from the author's projects.<br />Page 2 shows isolation booths/rooms.<br />Page 7 mentions the loudness problem, and presents -- like all the books -- speaker simulators as the main solution to the loudness problem, without considering various forms of power attenuation or speaker isolation enclosures.<br />Page 43 has a paragraph on &quot;speaker overdrive&quot;.<br />Page 44 covers re-amping a recorded dry guitar.  (This is also an efficient way to dial-in amp sounds, surpassed only by having one person play guitar and the other person operate the processors such as EQ and level settings throughout the processing chain.)<br />Pages 45 and 50 cover multimiking, which is important when a single person in a home studio wants to remote-mike a guitar speaker and efficiently dial-in a good sound at the mixer.<br />Page 57-58 has fair coverage of DI (direct inject of a line-level guitar signal into the mixer), together with the muddled coverage of dummy loads, and speaker simulators that is typical in the first wave of &quot;getting guitar sounds&quot; books. &quot;A speaker simulator provides a dummy load in the form of a power soak.&quot; That's incorrect and nonsensical. A better statement would be &quot;A typical speaker simulator product provides an artificial speaker load in the form of a resistive or reactive load, in addition to a cabinet-simulation filter.&quot; What's happening here, in this sloppy and overgeneral use of the term &quot;speaker simulator&quot; and &quot;power soak&quot;, is that the authors of the books have in mind a particular product they aren't explicitly discussing: the Palmer PDI-03 Speaker Simulator, which happens to comprise a dummy load and a cab-sim filter. <br />The term &quot;power soak&quot; is incorrect as a type of device, especially as a type of dummy load. The product, the Scholtz Power Soak, is a power attenuator, which can be used as a dummy load and contains a dummy load together with a wattage splitter. Odd, the author capitalizes &quot;speaker simulation... the Simulator&quot; -- supporting my contention that he ought to explicitly tell us he's talking about the Palmer PDI-03 Speaker Simulator. We need to be rigorous in distinguishing between particular products and general types of circuits or gear. Much of the confusion comes from using product names in place of technology types, and vice versa, as if saying &quot;A Dummy Load is a type of hot plate.&quot; These authors totally jumble the product and technology terms: Hot Plate (THD), Power Soak (Scholtz), PowerBrake (Marshall), Speaker Simulator (Palmer), Red Box, dummy load, power attenuator, speaker simulator, DI box, and cabinet-simulation filter.<br />Pages 62-63 almost cover pre-distortion EQ: &quot;the Sans Amp PSA 1... uses EQ pre and post overdrive to allow a very wide range of sounds. ... Alesis Quadraverb GT... EQ section offers almost too many options! ... You also have the option of running the EQ section pre or post pre-amp.&quot; The latter choice, &quot;pre or post pre-amp&quot;, reflects the industry-entrenched single-EQ fallacy, on the part of the author or Alesis; the right &quot;choice&quot; is both pre and post distortion; a Rock amp rig largely comprises a series of alternating eq and distortion stages. The book mentions Session Award JD10 (also known as the Morley JD10). Page 67 says &quot;a better eq could be patched in ... pre or post overdrive&quot; -- but there is no explanation, systematic or otherwise, of the difference between EQ before the preamp distortion (pickup EQ) and after the preamp distortion (amp EQ).  Neither does the book compare EQ before the tube power amp (this is &quot;amp EQ&quot;, controlling the power-tube distortion voicing) versus after the output transformer (speaker and mic EQ).<br />Page 137 half-insightfully says to play the guitar in the control room, with remote miked guitar speaker in the live room, but doesn't specify whether the guitar amp head is in the control room or in the sound room with the miked guitar speaker -- other books point out the tremendous advantages of using a head in the control room and a guitar speaker cab in the live room (or, to speak more meaningfully in a home studio context: using a tube power amp in the mixer room and a remote-miked guitar speaker in another room or enclosure).	2003-01-27

Page 26 mentions power amp distortion, and a power mode (1/2-power) switch, and shows a photo of the Marshall PowerBrake: &quot;Powerbrake, which is a heavy-duty volume control capable of absorbing the power of a flat-out amp to deliver the same tone at a lower volume...&quot;  This is the ideal, not the reality; many people hold that the THD Hot Plate is more transparent than the Marshall PowerBrake, but both products have a characteristic EQ response that manifests even with just a few dB of attenuation, and in addition, heavy attenuation inherently drives the guitar speaker differently, with less roundness and complexity, and this in turn affects the power-tube response.  It's odd that the author doesn't mention the Hot Plate, which is often favored over the PowerBrake, given that page 61 shows a photo of a guitarist (Carl V.?) with gear that includes a THD Hot Plate, low in the rack, behind the mic stand.<br />The book doesn't mention other solutions to the loudness problem including London Power's Power Scaling, the Peale Power Sag technology, and speaker isolation cabinets, and doesn't mention that the power reduction switch is 1/4-power on many amps, nor does it propose using truly low-wattage tube power amps such as 5 watts down to a fraction of a watt.<br />Page 76 mentions the problem of integrating a guitar preamp/processor with a tube amp, but doesn't have any specific advice; it leaves the reader dangling with a vague recommendation to do &quot;judicious reprogramming&quot; and &quot;serious tweaking and comparisons&quot;, rather than providing useful insight and practical guidance.<br />From the start, this series makes a potentially fatal mistake of separating without integrating guitars, amps, and effects. The &quot;getting guitar sounds&quot; books make more sense for those whose goal is to look at the combination of guitar, amp, and effects as a way of producing a target sound. How does a single-coil neck pickup, through a slow phaser, into a distorted tube power amp sound?	2003-01-27

There are more tricks, and there is much more relevant and helpful advice here, than the other books, CDs, or videos. This book is outstanding for its *relevance* -- the author is One Of Us; he knows the problems we face and tricks to help solve them; his thinking style is solidly grounded in the same reality of the typical Rock guitarist at home. He knows who he is writing for. The book oozes relevance and practicality.<br />The author doesn't know about using a power attenuator as a power attenuator -- only and always as a dummy load.  He says to try EQ before distortion, but never shows, like the BOSS booklet, literally running an eq&gt;dist&gt;eq pedal chain or putting an eq before the amp and another in the fx loop.  <br />Among all the books, there are only a couple paragraphs that say anything at all about power attenuators (used as power attenuators).  This omission, repeated in this book, is odd, given that most of the &quot;getting guitar sounds&quot; books mention the importance of power-tube distortion and speaker distortion.  <br />This book, like the others, doesn't usefully combine solutions, like combining the idea of a separate head and cab in control room and sound room with the idea of a speaker isolation enclosure.  This book talks about putting a combo amp in an isolation box, where you're using the combo amp's power amp, but it's far better to use a head in the control room -- using only the speaker of the boxed combo amp.<br />No existing book shows the important, basic, and fundamental processing chain: guitar pickup EQ, preamp distortion, amp EQ, tube power amp, power attenuator, guitar speaker/mic EQ.  That standard omission, where instead these pieces are scattered across the chapters, shows how far we are from having relevant instructional books about using gear for amp tone.<br />This book has a few brief paragraphs covering: speaker isolation boxes, remote miked guitar speaker, multimiking, pre-distortion EQ, using FX loops to split gear into two modules and recombine, direct inject of a preamp signal into a tube amp's power amp, importance of power-tube distortion, dummy loads, re-amping recorded dry guitar through a guitar amp, and active pickups.<br />In all the books about using guitar gear to get guitar sounds, I put sticky-tabs marking key, rarely covered aspects of amp tone gear usage. Most books ended up with about 10 tabs, but this book has around 50. The coverage indicated by each tab I inserted is usually very rudimentary; when I say that a tone secret tip is mentioned on a certain page, in most cases I mean that it is just barely touched on, with a couple garbled sentences, lacking systematic coverage. This book has five times as many useful tone tips, or 5 times as thorough coverage of such tips.  All these tone tips are fundamental and elementary, really, and should be explained to all beginning guitarists; although these are now considered &quot;advanced gear and amp tone secrets&quot;, they should actually be the first thing learned.	2003-01-27

It isn't really helpful in integrating effects into a practical foundation of amp tone, such as examining the fundamental chain of amp tone: pickup EQ, preamp distortion, amp EQ, power-tube distortion, power attenuator, speaker/mic EQ.<br />The distortion section says nothing about combining stages of distortion, or the relation between preamp distortion and power-tube distortion.  It doesn't mention shaping distortion voicing by pre-distortion EQ.  The EQ section says nothing about pre-distortion EQ versus post-distortion EQ; it says nothing but the totally obvious.  The Phaser section says nothing about where phasing can be placed, before or after a distortion stage.  Same with the Volume Pedal section.  <br />These effects sections don't integrate the effect within a rig chain, but that's one of the most important things guitarists should know.  It's rather obvious, by demoing pedals in the store, what each effect does on its own -- we really don't need a book for that, so in this sense, the book is superfluous and doesn't add value.  The issue of effects order is covered in a vague and helpless way on page 71 -- &quot;different pedals behave very differently depending on their order&quot;.  Do people buy this book just to be told what they already know?  No, they need specific advice, but the book doesn't have any, just &quot;try it&quot; -- tellingly, page 72 starts with an implicit admission of the lack of content in the book's main sections regarding effects placement: &quot;Instead of letting you leave empty-handed, it only seemed fair to offer some old family recipes for the road.&quot;<br />The book is basic in the wrong way; it could have presented 80 pages of insight and tricks for integrating various processors with a distorting tube power amp, comparing different sequences, and showing how to manage the loudness problem.  Instead, it's an inventory of the obvious.  Let's hope the next generation of guitar effects books studies the better, more professional-level books such as The Recording Guitarist.	2003-01-27

It is lacking in coverage of some key points within that scope, however.  It has only two pages of coverage of capturing that sound via microphones or direct-injection into the mixer.<br />...What's the purpose of talking about guitar effects in isolation from each other and from the amp?  Any moron can dial in individual effects in any guitar store -- meanwhile, we're left without a clue about how to bend amp tone itself through controlling eq and levels at multiple distortion stages from guitar pickups to studio monitors -- which is exactly what this book should, and doesn't, cover.  It covers some aspects of \\"getting great guitar sounds\\", but is limited as far as \\"getting great amp and distortion sounds\\". <br />At this point, there aren't enough books on getting guitar sounds to be very critical; we have to buy what's available and try to piece together the clues.

This book is so wide-ranging, it's hard to form a clear mental picture of its scope.  Arthur has innovative coverage speculating about entheogens in Egyptian and Asian as well as Christian religion.  <br />This subject is just getting started so there are few books and what few there are are speculative.  The entheogen theory of the origin of religions *makes sense*, particularly when focusing on the specifically religious aspect of religion rather than other aspects such as political, ethical, or sociological aspects.<br />Scholars, including esoteric and Literalist Christian scholars, agree that entheogenic plants are basically reliable triggers for religious experiencing.  Historians of religion are trying to use \\"psychology\\", \\"anthropology\\", and \\"sociology\\" to explain the origin of religions.  These explanatory threads point to entheogens at the fountainhead of religion, religious experiencing, and religious myth.<br />This book provides some evidence but most of all provides the all-important *perspective* from which we can see how well it makes good sense to look to entheogens for the origin of mystic experiencing at the root of religion.  There's really no reasonable argument against the entheogen theory of the origin of religion -- it enables a full-spectrum, integral-theory explanation of religion to finally come together.	2002-08-05

The most helpful aspect of this arrangement of material is that in the section covering the Gospel books, it presents selected chapters in chronological order (Sunday School materials might have set a precedent here).  <br />It's like an ideally arranged compendium of Sunday School booklets, with helpful background sections introducing major parts of the Bible.  It uses a classic style of graphics, combined with various types of art as DK Publishing excels in.<br />Everyone who is studying Christianity should read this first, to set up a basic framework of understanding.  This book portrays clearly and efficiently a point of reference to answer \\"What is the orthodox conventional reading of the Bible?\\"<br />This book reveals the anti-Semitism that builds up in the book of Acts; the Jews who supposedly persecuted the Christians are always shown in a two-dimensional, cardboard way, with mean expressions on their faces.  This book clearly portrays the conventional Christian reading of this material.  It's a good, clear portrayal of the standard orthodox way of reading the Bible.<br />There is an appendix of people's names in the back.  The book lacks, most of all, a set of genealogy diagrams.  It has a fairly good map in front, but could use more maps or at least a guide to the little maps that are dispersed throughout.<br />It has a great index.  After reading the book cover-to-cover, I highlighted the 50% of the index entries that are least clear to me, to do a 2nd, review pass.  I played a Bible trivia game and was inspired to read this book because I lacked too many of the standard Bible stories.  I can tell that I'll do much better in that Bible trivia game, and will do even better after reviewing more of the unfamiliar entries I found in this book's index.<br />I felt that getting through this book required the most perseverance when wading through the section about the kings who did or didn't worship God, and the section about Jesus' parables -- these are covered well, but these weren't the sections of the Bible I was most interested in.  My favorite sections of the book -- the subjects I was already most curious about -- were the stories between Eden and the later kings, and the stories between the Crucifixion and Revelation.  The book has a nice treatment of Revelation and explains its political context.  In the middle of the book, the parables and wisdom literature is covered.<br />I treasure this book and am glad to have read the Bible in this clear and understandable form.  Next, I may read the Bible Handbook by DK Publishing (John Bowker).  I'm reading Bowker's 2002 book from DK Publishing, God: A Brief History.  I've also read the pocket-size Bible handbook from DK Publishing, which isn't very enlightening -- it's a tiny, somewhat random subset of the Illustrated Family Bible.  I also recommend the books by DK Publishing, which I have read, covering Christianity, Myth, World Religions, and Philosophy.	2002-07-10

Through the first half, this didn't seem to be a book focusing on the Bible at all -- just the mundane daily-life background of the Bible, raising the question of what is meant by \\"Bible Companion\\".<br />I was expecting more coverage of the OT stories and a little more coverage of the NT stories, and less coverage of the backdrop of daily life.  Given the limited space, I'm surprised this book isn't primarily organized in terms of the OT and NT stories, only secondarily interweaving a little of daily life within that primary framework.<br />The text is tiny, but that turned out to not be a problem for me.<br />This book has some maps but really needs a couple genealogy diagrams covering the figures who are listed in the Who's Who section.  The book depends heavily on the un-illustrated Who's Who section in the back, losing the publisher's strength which is in integrated graphic/text communication.  The Who's Who text-only appendix, with sentences defining the relationships among the characters, is hard to grasp and retain.  A diagrammatic presentation of personal relationships would enable such a short book to communicate the stories more effectively, in a graspable way.<br />It's a fine book, but I hope the publisher makes these changes.  I commend DK Publishing for taking on the fun challenge of communicating so much in such a small space -- and I encourage them to continue refining their approach.  To get the full potential out of the book, I'll need to read it a second time, working from the text-only appendixes to the graphical matter in the main part of the book.	2002-06-17

DK Publishing has mastered the effective integration of fine multimedia page layout with top-notch writing, resulting in effective presentation of information.  <br />I have read several introductions to Philosophy -- this book finally brought it all together in my mind.

The book completely achieves what it sets out to do.  <br />I recommend the wonderful full-scale hardcover version of this book.  Whether you are intensely focused on philosophy or are casually interested, I strongly recommend reading this introduction before others.  I think the DK series amounts to a breakthrough in effective presentation of information.  <br />I am looking forward to books by this publisher on more topics, and am looking through their catalog to buy more books related to history, philosophy, and religion.  These books also make excellent gifts, and when I need a gift book on a subject, I look first to DK: for example, their 2001 catalog shows no book about Judaism, so I had to look around for a &quot;D&amp;K-style&quot; presentation by another publisher on the subject.  <br />D&amp;K has become a high standard by which to compare other publishers, particularly for presenting solid, useful introductions to non-fiction subjects.  The word &quot;introduction&quot; is inadequate: the D&amp;K approach to presenting information effectively provides the main, central enlightenment about a subject, in a rich multimedia way that stays vivid and fresh after finishing the book.  <br />The DK Publishing approach to presenting information has proven that text content does not need to be compromised when integrated with graphic content, and has shown how pictures and text can work together to build up comprehension and clarity.	2002-05-15

Historical Jesus scholars assume Christianity began in Palestine and spread from there.  They put their theoretical feet too firmly in Palestine, when Christianity was actually a product of the Hellenistic urban world, which somewhat violently took over the old, thus respectable, Jewish scriptures to give credibility to the new, Christian religion.  <br />Rieser has his theoretical feet firmly planted in the urban Roman empire, with an emphasis on my favored period of 70-313 CE, with a bit of focus on the pivotal change after that as the Christian religion became officially accepted and then co-opted and mandated by the same kind of power hierarchy it was originally designed to resist.<br />Rieser recommends we study the detailed socio-economic realities of Palestine as a backdrop for religious, pseudo-historical, edifying political fiction.  He shows how Christianity was started by the Jews of the Diaspora.  It was soon taken over and fully Hellenized by the lower class throughout the Roman Empire (with an increasingly artificial Jewish veneer).  <br />Christianity arrived last, not first, in Palestine -- that's why Christian archeological finds appear in Rome but not in Judea until the fourth century.  Jesus, the Apostles, and Paul are entirely fictional, though loosely based on types of actual individuals. Christianity was initially started by Jews, though these were the very heavily Hellenized Diaspora Jews, not the less-Hellenized Jews in Palestine.  <br />The heavily Hellenistic communities gradually invented and pulled together the pseudo-historical single figure and retroactively set him into the pre-70, Palestine backdrop.  <br />Once you abandon Historical Jesus -- and Historical Apostles and Historical Paul and that whole way of thinking -- many superior theoretical options open up for understanding the early Christian religion in terms of a mythically allegorized socio-political counter-religion to the hierarchical honor-hyperinflating system of divinized Caesar.  (I would point out that it also opens up the researcher's ability to think of earliest Christianity in terms of mythic allegory that describes and conveys primary religious experiencing.)<br />Christianity was almost immediately co-opted by the gentile lower class of the large cities of the Roman Empire, especially Rome, Alexandria, and the cities of Asia Minor (just to the east of Greece, including Byzantium/Constantinople), with increasing animosity between the Hellenists and Jews.  The Hellenist lower class found the Hellenic transformed version of the Jewish Diaspora messiah religion to be useful politically.<br />When Christianity finally arrived in Palestine, the Jews there shunned it as alien, unfamiliar, and just another attempt to invade and corrupt Israel with Hellenism.<br />Rieser mentions the central importance of sacred meals in mystery religions and mentions Jesus as the \\"drug, or pharmakos, of immortality\\", but has no insight into entheogenic experiential allegory.  Why would wine and bread deserve to be placed at the center of any Hellenistic religion?  Historical and socio-political treatments such as this tend to completely omit religious experiencing from their theory of Christianity.  <br />They assume that the ritual makes the eucharist or sacrament seem potent, rather than vice versa.  Though Rieser explains how the Hellenized transformation of the messiah story was politically meaningful and useful to the Hellenes, he doesn't mention that it was also fully amenable to allegorically expressing the standard core mystery-religion with a storyline that is fictionally set in Palestine rather than in the mythic realm as such.  <br />Instead of a story about a mythic Prometheus chained to a rock, or a mythic Attis tied to or encased in a tree trunk, or Isaac bound to the altar, the pseudo-historical Jesus figure is fastened to a cross, just like (as Rieser states) the actual rebel slaves and underclass in Rome or in Judea.<br />Rieser has only passing, shallow coverage of the mystery religions.  But if the Hellenistic mystery-religion mythic storylines were intended to describe the initiation experiences encountered by the mystery-religion initiate after consuming something sacred, the pseudo-historical Jesus storyline may also be experienced firsthand after the Christian initiate partakes of a Last Supper before entering the kingdom of God that is revealed when time ends.  <br />Rieser provides plenty of hooks for such an explanation, but, like almost all the overly historical-oriented modern researchers, is unable to treat this experiential allegory dimension which calls out for coverage.<br />Rieser reduces religion to the socio-political realm instead of recognizing the overlaid, richly interpenetrating layers of political allegory and mystic-state experiential allegory.  The mythic-only Christ theorists Freke and Gandy, conversely, explain experiential initiation in the original Christian religion, in The Jesus Mysteries, and in Jesus and the Lost Goddess, but omit the socio-political layer of allegory.  <br />The socio-political perspective without mystery-religion experiential allegory is less than completely convincing, because it implausibly omits Hellenistic-style primary religious experiencing from early Christianity.<br />Rieser's plausible and realistic view of the Roman Empire and the changing Hellenistic/Jewish relationships is still ahead of current research in the U.S.  Every Christian-origins scholar should read The True Founder of Christianity and the Hellenistic Philosophy.  Its style, perspective, and sensibility are valuable and it makes an essential contribution to the field.<br />I have read The Jesus Myth, The Jesus Puzzle, The Jesus Mysteries, Deconstructing Jesus, The Christ Myth, The Christian Myth, and The Christ Conspiracy.

Freed from objectivism, positivism, and hermeneutical naivete, the quest becomes a search for our own true selves reflected in the mirror held up to us by Jesus. The task is not to produce the historical Jesus &quot;as he really was,&quot; but to help co-create the &quot;myth of the human Jesus.&quot; Thus understood, the Jesus-quest is the attempt to create a plausible historical portrait of Jesus in response to personal, social, and theological needs of the present&quot;.-Walter Wink, Auburn Theological Seminary <br />This work is a psychological examination and critique of the philosophical assumptions guiding historical knowledge in the quest for the historical Jesus. By combining a critical historiography with a phenomenological reading of C. G. Jung's analytical psychology, this work brings the hermeneutic question in the quest for the historical Jesus to the foreground. Psyche and world cannot be separated in research and interpretation, and the unconscious ground of our &quot;knowledge&quot; cannot be escaped. The picture of the &quot;historical Jesus&quot; is always a story we tell and not knowledge we discover. While historical criticism cannot recover Jesus, the historical approach to Jesus is important because, rightly understood, it participates in the process of individuation, as described by Jung, through the withdrawal of the projection of the self from the figure of Jesus. This leads to the evolution of consciousness as a contemporary form of incarnation within the individual and society.<br />Hal Childs is a psychotherapist and Executive Co-Director of the California Counseling Institute in San Francisco.	2002-04-03

However, it was unclear which entheogens might be allegorized in those scriptures. Heinrich presents a fine and sufficient candidate. <br />He also presents a brilliant hypothesis that the story of the Exodus is based around ergot poisoning of the yeast supply. Chris Bennett in Sex, Drugs, Violence and the Bible makes a case for cannabis especially in the Old Testament, and Dan Merkur in Mystery of Manna, and in Psychedelic Sacrament, makes a case for ergot in the Old Testament.<br />This is a model of a fine book. The prose is clear, artistic, and masterful. The photos are stunning and perfectly support his case, showing the shape-shifting Amanita in its various lifecycle stages, explaining how each stage is allegorized in Hindu, Christian, and alchemical traditions.

Various separate threads of mystic techniques have sometimes come together to form an approach to the mystic altered state that is based on rational reflection, together with short-session use of visionary plants, rather than continuous long-term meditation.<br />This book associates a seemingly overlooked tradition of short-session meditation with the use of psychoactive, visionary plants.  The use of psychoactives enables a more rationality-oriented approach and obviates the need to constantly meditate for long-term periods.  This entheogen-using, short-session, rational form of mysticism is being increasingly recognized throughout Western history.  Meditation, psychoactives, and rational thinking can be and historically have been brought together to augment each other.<br />Merkur helps entheogen researchers focus not only on revealing the presence of particular plants in mystic-state practices, but also on the traditions of using the plants in a shared religious framework and reflecting on the experiences produced by the visionary plants.  The field of mysticism greatly needs such coverage of the important and challenging semi-secret tradition of not only entheogen use, but entheogen use combined with rational mysticism and short-session meditation.<br />I don't think Merkur is claiming that the mystics who combine these approaches claim that every aspect of mystic experiencing is entirely rationally explainable and conceptually tangible; the vision of the transcendent cosmic throne may still include a certain aspect that is, in a way, beyond the reach of complete, direct conceptualization.<br />Despite the seemingly entrenched assumptions that mysticism is inherently slow and laborious, drug-free, and non-rational, rational short-session meditation forms an effective alternative tradition or alternative view of what approach makes sense.  This proposal contradicts the dominant assumptions about the techniques and conventions of mysticism: the assumption, perhaps misguided, that mysticism ideally should not use psychoactives, is not rationality-oriented, and must be conducted for extended, endlessly long meditation periods. In some semi-obscured traditions that are recently coming to light, these approaches have come together naturally and effectively.<br />This seems similar to the \\"lightning-bolt\\" short-path variety of Buddhist meditation technique as portrayed by James Arthur in Mushrooms and Mankind, which points out that Vajrayana was created by combining Tantric Buddhism and the native Bon shamanism of Tibet.  The approach Merkur describes also seems equivalent to the evident visionary-state experiencing on tap in the Hellenistic mystery-religions, in which a person commonly undergoes a moderate number of limited-duration initiations to achieve spiritual purification and mental transformation, reshaping the mind's conception of the self by the encounter with transcendent experiencing.<br />Merkur, as psychologist, contrasts the experience of loss of the sense of personal freedom, which he portrays as being conventional mysticism, with a supposedly different experience of a psychoactive rational mysticism that involves panic attacks.  However, I'd point out that the loss of the sense of being a metaphysically free agent is integral to a mystic-state panic attack.  When the psychoactive perspective and self-sense, combined with rational analysis about our assumption of personal sovereign agency, suspends the sense of wielding metaphysically free power, that is the very cause and central vortex of the panic attack. The self-commanding part of the mind panics because the mind perceives the lack of metaphysical freedom and self-control, and sees the mind's vulnerable dependence on the mysterious uncontrollable arising of personal control-thoughts, like discovering that one's controllership is dependent on whatever happens to come up from an underground spring in a cave.<br />Merkur uses the Psychology interpretive paradigm, but that would be strengthened by a stronger Philosophy of Metaphysics background, including the philosophy of time and responsible control agents. The book doesn't really explain what the union with God experience, or the vision of the invisible transcendent controller on the cosmic throne above one's personal controllership level, would be like for a modern entheogenic rational mystic. <br />Merkur reveals the occasional conjunction of Western religion and psychoactives, and also a kind of rationality which I would call, with Ken Wilber, \\"vision-logic\\" or visionary rationality. <br />Fortunately, this book does not depend on identifying mystic sacraments as any one visionary plant.  There is consensus in the field of the entheogen theory of religion that it is more important to identify scriptural allusions to psychoactives, and find how psychoactives were combined with meditation and visionary rationality, than to identify the main and minor entheogens used.  The important point is to recognize the terms \\"sacrament\\" or \\"manna\\" as meaning visionary plants.<br />Subsections include The Necessity of Vision; Philo's Meditative Practices; Other Varieties of Ecstasy in Philo; The Contemplative Practice of Aristotle; Discursive Meditations in Islam; Bernard on Intellectualist Mysticism; Bernard on Trance-Based Mysticism; Death and Resurrection at Sinai; Maimonides on Meditation, and others.<br />Merkur provides essential coverage of primary religious experiencing at the origin and heart of Judeo-Christianity, providing highly valuable contributions that help to discovering the semi-suppressed tradition and history of entheogens in Western religion, as well as expanding our expectations about the nature of mystic experiencing.  This book is a step toward covering entheogens casually as just one part, not especially novel or controversial, of a system of philosophy and religion. <br />This scholarly book is clear, organized, and presents a focused and well-supported thesis -- an excellent source for researchers to cite.  Merkur is a clear writer who states where he's headed, states why he's covering subjects, and summarizes what he has established.<br />An invaluable, much needed, must-have contribution to research in the history of mysticism, theory of mystic-state insight and experiencing, and the entheogen theory of religion.	2002-04-01

This is a fascinating expose of the Catholic Church, especially if you have never read about the differences between Catholocism and Protestantism.  <br />I wish Dave would write more about Reformed theology; having read nearly all of his nonfiction books, I remained completely unaware that free will was a contentious issue that was used to create and break away the Protestant tradition from Catholocism.  To provide that background, a starting place is Sproul's Willing to Believe: The Controversy over Free Will.  <br />A book even more focused on issues such as free will in the Protestant/Catholic divide is The Roman Catholic Controversy: Catholics &amp; Protestants -- Do the Differences Still Matter?, by James R. White.  I read Hunt's book and these two books cover to cover.  Don't make the mistake I did and limit yourself to reading books about Christianity by one author, such as Hunt.  <br />An especially good remedy to break away from the limitation of having just one perspective on Christianity is to read a couple of general histories of Christianity (search on &quot;history of Christianity&quot;).  This will provide perspectives and background on the Reformation that you won't get from reading Hunt's book, which only provides a Fundamentalist Prophecy perspective.<br />Hunt is the voice of scholarly American fundamentalist Protestantism. He is a careful and consistent fundamentalist; he is not vague. He accepts supernaturalism as a starting point, and builds rationally and clearly on that basis, such as accepting the existence of spirit creatures. <br />This is a great introduction to Catholic history and doctrine and shows what a tremendous step forward Luther brought, though Protestantism still retains a lot of the Catholic orthodox supernaturalist Literalist reading of the Bible.	2002-03-30

Did Christianity Begin with a Mythical Christ? : Challenging the Existence of an Historical Jesus	Books	5	13	22	N	Y	An essential Radical Humanist Debunking book	To characterize Doherty's book in relation to others, here is a high-level comparative guide to books about Jesus.  Doherty's \\"radical humanist debunking\\" book is essential, though limited.<br />Orthodox mystics<BR>(Supernaturalist esoteric Historical Jesus researchers.) These investigators research Jesus' life as part of seeking direct mystical experiences of the supernatural Christ, which manifested as the actual Historical Jesus. They think Jesus was supernatural and also can be experienced mystically.<br />Orthodox literalists<BR>(Supernaturalist non-esoteric Historical Jesus researchers.) These do Historical Jesus research as part of worshipping the Christ of Faith. The assume there was a real, single, towering supernatural Historical Jesus who performed miracles, was resurrected from death, and is God. Even if they let go of some or all miracles, they maintain that Jesus is holy, is uniquely God, and is the Savior. The very existence of Christianity depends on an actual, single, uniquely holy Jesus.<br />Modernist mystics<BR>(Non-supernaturalist, esoteric Historical Jesus researchers.) These assume Jesus was a mystery-religion initiator and spirituality expert who was unfortunately crucified. This approach so well explains mythic allegorical Christianity, an actual Jesus tends to become an unnecessary hypothesis, though by habit of tradition, such theorists try to find something for the supposed Historical Jesus to do as part of the mystery religion: he spent time with the Essenes as the Teacher of Righteousness, or was an even more towering and ethically influential man. Example: Andrew Welburn's book, The Beginnings of Christianity: Essene Mystery, Gnostic Revelation and the Christian Vision.<br />Moderate demythologizers<BR>(Non-supernaturalist, non-esoteric Historical Jesus researchers.) These are today's mainstream Jesus scholars and liberal Christians, who focus on Historical Jesus studies to uncover a supposed liberal ethical teacher. They assume therewas a real, single, towering Jesus, upon whom many myths were piled. They treat Jesus as a largely unique figure, though not a unique holy savior. Examples: The Jesus Seminar.<br />Skeptical hyperpluralists<BR>(Non-supernaturalist, non-esoteric, skeptical Historical Jesus researchers.) These are interested in exploring our inability to choose among the plethora of Jesuses and Christs rather than promoting a particular Jesus. They acknowledge the mythic-only Christ hypothesis, but don't treat that any more seriously than any particular proposed Historical Jesus. Examples: Richard Grigg, Imaginary Christs: The Challenge of Christological Pluralism; Robert Price: Deconstructing Jesus.<br />Radical humanist debunkers<BR>(Non-supernaturalist, non-esoteric mythic-only Christ researchers.) These classic scientific humanists neglect or belittle esoteric religious experiencing. Religion is bad; it's all superstition and deceptive myth to manipulate weak and irrational minds. This approach equates all religion with exoteric religion, and dismisses religion, without giving special coverage of esoteric religion and its claims to provide transcendent knowledge, insight, or wisdom beyond what scientific humanism provides. When Jesus is proven to be mythical, Christianity automatically vanishes altogether (\\"good riddance\\") for such scorched-earth debunkers. Example: Earl Doherty's The Jesus Puzzle: Did Christianity Begin with a Mythical Christ?<br />Fully allegorical mystics<BR>(Non-supernaturalist, esoteric/allegorical mythic-only Christ researchers.) <BR>These researchers propose an esoteric, allegorical, usually mystic-experiencing theory of the origin of Christianity. Scientific history refutes the Historical Jesus hypothesis, which should be replaced by a positive alternative hypothesis of the Jesus figure as an allegorical mythic personification of esoteric initiation experience that, with the Holy Spirit, conveys transcendent knowledge, enlightenment, an experiential core of religious insight, spiritual, mental, and ethical transformation, and the revealing of hidden wisdom. Mystery-religions are entheogenic (see James Arthur's Mushrooms & Mankind, and Clark Heinrich), experiential (Andrew Welburn), and determinism-transcending (see Luther Martin's Hellenistic Religions). Examples: Freke and Gandy's The Jesus Mysteries, and Jesus & The Lost Goddess, propose a Gnostic drama of Jesus rescuing Sophia, the lost and deluded soul; Acharya S, author of The Christ Conspiracy, proposes an astrotheology explanation for the origin of Christianity. The Jesus that became canonical was a mythical, allegorical figure loosely based on a variety of political, ethical, and religious figures of the era. The canonical Jesus is a socio-political rebel, liberator of those oppressed by the power establishment, whose storyline also allegorizes the mystic experiences of Hellenistic mystery-religion initiation. Jesus is an allegorical mythic dying/rising savior figure as in Hellenistic mystery-religions. His dramatic mystery-ritual storyline is set in the historical rather than mythic realm; it is about political rebellion against the power establishment that tried to use religion to justify the oppressive status quo. The power establishment took over this politically and mystically popular religion of Jesus to defuse it by making it a supernaturalist exoteric-only religion.<br />Doherty's radical humanist debunking approach may have an immediate impact because its methodology and style is so similar to the moderate demythologizers. This approach uses the methodology and style of the moderate demythologizers to refute the unexamined foundation of their entire system. The approach of fully allegorical mysticism is too great a jump for the mainstream of Jesus researchers at this point; they may need to transition through the radical humanist debunking approach before proceeding forward to the fully allegorical esoteric approach. However, they might change more readily if a positive alternative explanation of the origin of Christianity -- fully allegorical mysticism -- is provided, instead of a purely negative explanation (deceit and superstition) or a purely exoteric, socio-political explanation (Rodney Stark) without any mystic-experiencing aspect.<br />The radical humanist debunkers most immediately contradict the moderate-demythologizer mainstream, which simply takes it for granted that some single Jesus or another existed -- the question of *whether* such a single man existed is out of bounds as an investigation for them; for them, the only question is about the details. <br />The fully allegorical, mythic-only Christ books may be more relevant in the long run, into the era that will be familiar with the no-Historical-Jesus alternative. But at the moment, the radical humanist debunker approach seems to be the most likely to be influential. The skeptical hyperpluralists are also likely to be influential, because they highlight the overabundance of plausible scenarios about Jesus.<br />...	2002-03-25

I read this cover to cover and have found about a dozen similar books on original mystery-initiation experiential Christianity;...One interesting proposal in this book is that the figure of Lazarus is the author, fictionally speaking, of the Gospel of John. <br />As is standard for almost all late 20th Century scholars, Welburn uncritically assumes that Jesus existed, even as he presents a totally non-orthodox paradigm of what Christianity was really all about and where it came from. He wonders why the canon doesn't tell about Jesus' initiation practices, even though he explains Steiner's portrayal of Jesus' betrayal, arrest, trial, judgement, humiliation, crucifixion, burial, and ascension as themselves the experiential content of such Christian-style initiation.<br />Actually I hope Steiner's theory here is a little more complete than Welburn's explanation, which omits the trial and judgment phase of experiential mystic Christianity. The trial and judgment phase of the mystery drama is experientially crucial -- it is here where the mind questions the concept of the sovereign egoic moral agent and judges the idea to be monstrously incoherent, suitable only for animals and children. I don't know if Steiner covers this phase; Welburn doesn't.<br />At this point in recent history-oriented studies, in such theories as mystery-religion Christianity, the Historical Jesus assumption is just a clumsy and superfluous complication getting in the way, adding complexity without enabling theories to be simplified. <br />Welburn should at least ask whether the hypothesis of the existence of a single Historical Jesus is helpful for a coherent theory of the true origins of the Christian mystery religion. The *idea* of a historical figure is great and profound, but shouldn't be confused with the *actuality* of a historical figure who undergoes literal biographical events of betrayal, trial, and crucifixion. Welburn, of all scholars, should realize this. Nevertheless, this is an excellent book deserving a strong 5 stars.<br />As in any study of Christianity compared to mystery religions, this has enough mentions of sacred eating and drinking to hook into the entheogen theory of the origin of religions, and enough mentions of fate, determinism, necessity, or heimarmene to hook into a block-universe determinism theory.<br />Top-quality scholarship. Strongly recommended for those interested in original Christianity as essentially a mystic experiential mystery-religion. The endnotes contain pointers to related interesting books.<br />The author often mentions Rudolph Steiner's book Christianity as Mystical Fact.	2002-03-13

The book explains the Valentinian gnostic reading of Paul's early epistles. \\"Jews\\" means literalists, the uninitiated, lower Christians. \\"Greeks\\" means spiritualists, the initiated, higher Christians. Paul encouraged the higher Christians to feel united or married with the lower Christians.<br />The book would greatly benefit from a 2-column listing of the ideas the Valentinians associated with the higher and lower Christians. As a philosopher and theorist of ego death who is looking for a rational reading of the Christian scriptures, I agree with everything that falls into the group of ideas the Valentinians associated with higher Christians, and I disagree with all the ideas that fall into the group of ideas the Valentinians associated with lower Christians.<br />The two sets of doctrines -- the book The Gnostic Paul divides the religious ideas as follows, from the Valentinian reading of Paul's early writings:<br />HIGHER, ESOTERIC CHRISTIANITY<BR>\\"Greeks\\"<BR>The religion of Heresy<BR>Early Paul<BR>The Truth, wisdom, enlightenment<BR>The initiated, adults<BR>A secret mystery is revealed to some apostles, but not to other apostles<BR>The sacrament of apolytrosis (apo- can mean after-, post-, and separate redemption) in addition to common eucharist<BR>Redemption<BR>Spiritual freedom from moral codes -- but metaphysical determinism/fatedness, predestined election<BR>Reject idea of responsible moral agency and idea of our culpability of sin/guilt<BR>The apple was a gift of gnosis<BR>All blame is placed on the Ground, not us<BR>No death on the Cross (it was mythic and could be seen as a pseudo-death)<BR>Sacrifice is mythic, mental, conceptual, a mental experience<BR>No bodily resurrection<BR>Mythic Christ<BR>Belief in higher and lowerChristians (with a principled respect for the lower)<BR>No point in moral-reward heaven or moral-punishment hell<BR>We are spirits, controlled by God<br />LOWER, EXOTERIC CHRISTIANITY<BR>\\"Jews\\"<BR>The Orthodox religion<BR>Peter, The Church Fathers and their forged later Paul<BR>The Lie, error, darkness, foolishness<BR>The uninitiated, children<BR>No secret mystery; all apostles have authority through simple ordinary seeing of miraculous resurrection<BR>The common eucharist, only<BR>Salvation, baptism<BR>Spiritual enslavement to morality -- with delusion of free will and choosing faith oneself<BR>Belief in responsible moral agency and our culpability for sin/guilt<BR>All blame is placed on us<BR>The apple was bad<BR>Jesus died on the Cross<BR>Sacrifice is bodily, bloody, magically effective, physical<BR>Bodily resurrection<BR>Supernaturalist Jesus<BR>Disbelief in higher level of Christianity -- to obtain unity and harmony of the Church<BR>Moral-reward heaven and moral-punishment hell exist, for the responsible agent/soul<BR>We are souls, controlled by ourselves<BR> <BR>Each point I listed above should have page references to Pagel's book to prove that the ideas break out this way in her book.<br />An important reason why Christ-myth scholars should read this book is that Pagels shows how to read the scriptures in a 2-valued ambiguous way, where the meaning deliberately toggles between two distinct readings. It's not just that Paul was misinterpreted; Pagel's treatment seems to indicate that Paul deliberately wrote in an encoded, ambiguous way that flips between the two conceptual systems. If people were confused, it is because Paul meant for them to be confused and carefully chose his words so that they could support both readings: literal and spiritual. The epistles were written as encoded mysteries and should be read as such.<br />The most remarkable thing presented repeatedly in this book is the idea that the Pauline writings intentionally withheld the higher view from the uninitiated.  Pagels never ventures to explain why.  Perhaps the Valentinians wanted to protect and preserve the delusion of the ego just as we protect children.  This problem extends beyond the Christian mystery-religion; the Greek mystery religions forbade, by punishment of death, publically revealing the things shown in the mysteries.  There were political reasons to veil a deterministic belief system, because cosmic determinism has been used to justify an oppressive status quo (\\"I was meant, fated, and divinely ordained by Necessity to dominate you\\") rather than democracy.  So the Pauline writings were deliberately written in a way that would be read in a supernatural, Literalist way but could be read as a non-supernatural, mystery-religion, mystic allegory.	2002-01-15

Explains how the drug war is *fake* -- a flimsy invented excuse for persecution for profit and for generating the funny money that the corporate state needs.<br />The War on Drugs has nothing to do with reducing drug use, and everything to do with immoral means on the part of the authorities to gain power and money for themselves, no matter what the cost to others. If the so-called \\"drug problem\\" was eliminated today, the prohibition industry would hasten to re-create the \\"drug problem\\" as quickly as possible -- their income depends on it. This book follows the money and shows how this evil situation came about.<br />Drug policy reformers especially should read this book, to understand how the leading prohibitionists are incincere. You can't take the prohibitionists seriously after reading this book. They are fakes, actors, manipulators, amoral liars -- con artists. The drug war is revealed as a giant con scheme on the part of the prohibitionists who strive to whip up fear and panic among the gullible public.<br />Covers 19th and 20th century prohibition for profit.

It is the perfect size for an introduction to the main ideas and traditions in Christianity. It is not too short, but is certainly not overly long either; it isn't too hard to read this cover to cover. It is clear, and throughout, compares Protestant, Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and other main forms of Christianity. <br />The pictures are charmingly honest and realistic, showing actual people worshipping and doing other Christian activities. I have been reading special topics in theology but needed a basic backgrounder to broadly survey Christian traditions. The book emphasizes what might be called current traditions; it has good coverage of the origins of Christianity but is not primarily about the historical development of Christianity. It is balanced and appropriate for anyone who wants to quickly survey the main ideas and traditions of Christianity. <br />This book would make a great gift for anyone. It is written very clearly and straight. It points out some of the most surprising aspects of Christianity such as the sudden ending of Mark with the empty tomb and no post-resurrection appearance. It provides a fair, reasonable, and unbiased comparison of the different forms of Christianity. <br />The book does have some incidental weaknesses, such as the glossary entries which really should each be twice as long. Given that each page spread lists relevant glossary entries, I would expect the glossary entries to be more insightful. However, the book definitely achieves its goal in a nice, glossy yet accessible format. It is physically an ideal size to handle -- not so large like a coffeetable book that it becomes difficult to handle.<br />I especially enjoyed the coverage of Eastern Orthodox Christianity.	2001-12-18

Allegro acts as though portraying Christianity as mushroom- and fertility- based, he has demolished the credibility of Christianity altogether.<br />He disrespects his subject matter, like Aldous Huxley's smugly self-assured, ignorant, disgusted attitude toward entheogens before he experienced them.  Not only was this book 30 years ahead of its time, the book was 30 years ahead of its author's ability to understand entheogens.  Given that this sensationalist pulp book was written to shock a mass audience and discredit Christianity within that audience, it is unclear how ignorant or enlightened Allegro is about the efficacy of entheogens to cause intense religious experience and possibly valid mystic-state insight into the relation of self, control, time, and world.<br />Jesus is portrayed as none other than the Amanita, but that completely discredits Christianity for Allegro the scorched-earth, anti-religion humanist.  The book is just as startling and confusing for entheogen-positive readers as those who are unfamiliar or dismissive of entheogens.  Allegro made the mistake of alienating both orthodox Literalist Christians and esoteric mystics.  The book is a real mixed bag, and the befuddling swarms of etymologies limit the readability as well.<br />Entheogenists may welcome his assertion that the inner circle of the early Christians used entheogens, specifically Amanita, but will be put off because he then turns around and holds a dismissive, pop-sensationalist attitude against entheogens.  Entheogenists may also get more than they bargained for in this book when Allegro proposes that there was no man Jesus; Jesus was none other than the Amanita. <br />His theory is groundbreaking: he was the first to propose in some detail that Christianity was entheogen-orientedand that the entheogen was Amanita, and to additionally propose (in conjunction) that there was no historical Jesus.<br />The book, though flawed by sensationalism, is important, and required vision and daring.  There was almost complete ignorance about entheogens when this book was published.  I would recommend this book more for entheogen book collectors and scholars of the origins of Christianity than for general readers.<br />For related books, see my Amazon book lists: Ego death as deterministic self-control cancellation; Original, experiential, mystical Christianity; Christianity as political rebellion against \\"divine\\" Caesar; Mythic-only Christ theory; Entheogen theory of the origin of religions.	2001-11-11

The ideas are not at all outdated. I've read the recent Christ-myth books, such as The Jesus Puzzle, The Christ Conspiracy, The Jesus Mysteries, The Jesus Myth, and Deconstructing Jesus. This book and The Jesus Mysteries are my favorites because instead of only refuting the historical Jesus and discarding the whole of the Jesus story, they ask what is the meaning and value of the myth, in terms of religious experiencing and insight into the relation of self and world.<br />The conclusion of this book is that given the choice between Jesus as myth and the historical Jesus, the right path for religion as religion is to choose Jesus as myth. If all we have is the historical Jesus of liberal Protestantism, then we no longer have religion, just mundane morality divested of both myth and the supernatural. But if we retain Jesus as myth, then we retain the religious redemption that is possible. He asserts that the Catholic Church could become legitimate by abandoning the historical Jesus and emphasizing the mythic Jesus as redeemer. Despite his elevation of redemption as the true essence of religion, Drews does not define redemption. (I'd define redemption as reconciliation between the self as moral agent and that from which it emanates.) Drews does not explicitly define this reconciliation and explain specifically how the Jesus myth assists this reconciliation.<br />He explains a main motive for creating the assertion of the historical Jesus. The early Jewish Christian leaders used a strategy of trying to limit authority to themselves and shut out competitors such as Paul and his Gentile/mythic Christianity by creating historical requirements that would serve to exclude others and restrict authority to themselves. Drews shows that this is the same strategy the Church fathers used: assert that the only spiritual authority is that of the person who spent time with the historical Jesus. If Jesus is allowed to be purely mythic, religious authority is potentially spread evenly among all people, but if Jesus is historical as well as mythic, the profitable and advantageous possibility of excluding other authorities arises.<br />Drews emphasizes the sacred meal as central to early Christian worship and compares it to the central role of soma (= \\"body\\") in Vedic religion, thus this book is useful for the entheogenic theory of religion.	2001-02-19

The Christ-myth books (The Christ Conspiracy, The Jesus Puzzle, Deconstructing Jesus, The Jesus Mysteries) describe how the story began first as history-style myth and then later became reified as actual historical events of a single, toweringly influential Jesus figure.<br />In Paul's authentic epistles, Jesus is mythical, and in the synoptic gospels, Jesus is historical. Why place John after the synoptics, then? It makes more sense to see John as the bridge from the mythic early epistles to the later synoptic Literalist/historicizing gospels, to form a smooth progression. <br />The more I read other recent books, the more I keep being drawn to The Unfinished Gospel. Right now there is a tension building up; it's so inconsistent with the latest conception of the transformation of Christianity in the first few centuries to assume the John is later than the synoptics. This book may become a classic, because there is an established minority of scholars who agree that John reflects earlier traditions than the synoptic gospels.<br />I expect that once the other contemporary scholars consider how perfectly this book's redating fits in with their theories of myth-making and historicizing, this book could garner a lot of attention. Gnostic, esoteric, and Christ-myth scholars should consider this book.	2000-11-11

Books	5	6	8	N	N	The most memorable of the Christ-myth books	As a rational theorist of religious experiencing, I was able to immediately revise my theory of the visions of Christ after reading this book -- it saved my universal theory of how the mythic-only death-and-rebirth savior figure works psychologically. The Christ-myth theory so vividly and compellingly explained in this book enabled me to make very slight adjustments to suddenly move from an untenable, only locally or \\"tribally\\" valid, Christianity-centric explanation of the entheogenic ego-death experience to a largely universal and ecumenical, non-Christian theory of the experience of Christ.<br />This book marks a major turning point or breakthrough past the impasse of the popular assertion that Christianity is uniquely inspired. It turns out that the unique inspiration of the Christ vision is not the property of Christianity; Christianity stole and monopolized the idea that everyone already believed (the Christ-myth), literalized the story, and then killed all the mythic-Christ believers and burned their writings.<br />This book has freed the Christ myth from the clutches of Literalist, historicist Christianity. These authors have a high regard for The Gnostic Gospels, which I then read; taking the two books together, it becomes clear how the Literalist view garnered power for the authorities through creating an artificial scarcity of seeing Christ. <br />Christ as a mystery-religion renders the savior-vision democratically and directly accessible to all people, rather than forcing people to access Christ through the narrow conduit of the priestly hierarchy. <br />This book is fun, exciting, profound, and easy to read. It also explains some of the pagan philosophy of the ego-death experience. It is more informed by pagan and non-Christian philosophy than most of the Christ-myth books, which focus on Christianity in too much isolation from the surrounding religious philosophies. <br />The Jesus Mysteries is not coming from within Christianity and coming into contact with pagan religious experiencing; it moves the other direction, which is historically more comprehensible and vivid: from a universal mediterranean backdrop of pagan religious thought, the book shows how Christianity developed by combining and modifying ideas about the mythic Christ figure.	2000-11-11

She provides motives and explains why the books of the Bible were written in the odd, magic-thinking language that is so unnatural and stilted. She agrees with The Jesus Conspiracy, that Jesus was removed prematurely from the cross (\\"Pilate could not believe he was dead so soon.\\")<br />I don't think Theiring's books so far are on the very most promising path, though her theory may have a lot to contribute about the political dynamics of the time and Jewish ideas about purity, and about reading allegorically.<br />I have turned full attention to the mythic Jesus theory; there was no towering historical Jesus and no single person underlying the essentially mythical, composite Jesus figure.
