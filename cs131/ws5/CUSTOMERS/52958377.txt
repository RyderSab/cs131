Three weeks into this program, I have to admit: this works! I am a forty-year-old mom who had been yo-yo dieting and binge-eating for four years, struggling to lose the last  five pounds of pregnancy weight-gain. Before, I was always one of those thin people who ate whatever I wanted without a thought about the amount of food I was eating. Now, incredibly, the pounds are coming off, and I am eating whatever I want. No more dieting. No more bingeing. By just working out aerobically for 30 minutes a day and eating only when I feel hungry, I am making my body slim down because my body thinks I need to work like this to survive. I was skeptical at first, and even fearful of losing control over my eating, but this book gave me a good dose of science and helped me take a leap of faith in my body's biology. This book explains how it is. I am immensely grateful for this book. Thank you, Mr. Hariton. Anyone who really wants to end the agony of yo-yo dieting should get and read this book. Just try the program for three weeks, and you'll be glad you did.    Update on earlier review (above): It's been two months since I gave this book a rave review for having changed my life and body for the better after only three weeks on the plan. I am back to report that, yes, this plan really, really works. The results amaze me: In less than three months I have lost seven pounds, down to my pre-pregnancy weight, and I have lost 3/4 inch off my hips, down to my pre-pregnancy measurement. And I have done this just by stationary-bicycling or speed-walking for 30 minutes a day and by eating whatever I feel like whenever I am hungry. Believe me, I eat whatever and howevermuch I want -- I even overeat at times (for example, during the recent Christmas holidays!). It's just that often I find I am not all that hungry. According to Hariton's theory, this would be because the daily 30-minute workout makes my body think that it needs to work hard physically for survival and cannot afford to carry anyexcess weight.     To be thin again now, while eating whatever I want, just as when I was younger -- this is so weird, and so wonderful! Goodness, I owe so much to this one, little gem of a book. To everyone who struggles with a weight prblem, I say this: please give this plan a sincere try. Buy this book, or just borrow it from the public library, but give it -- give yourself -- a chance.	2004-11-20

Lerner writes extremely well, and with a deliciously mordant sense of humor. As someone who has suffered from compulsive overeating and binge-eating, I can tell you that Lerner's account is deadly accurate as to what life is like for people like us. This is a story that I have lived in many respects, yet Lerner puts it into words in a way that I never could. This is not just about the obese or overweight person; it is also about the multitudes of us who are consumed by calories and the struggle to lose weight, whether it be 100 pounds or 10 pounds. A very good read.	2003-03-31

Every year, on the first chilly day of autumn, I get this book off the shelf and read &quot;A Christmas Memory.&quot; The story is a beautiful, elegiac account of Miss Sook's seasonal ritual of fruitcake-baking and gift-giving, which she and Truman Capote shared. The story encapsulates the spirit of the season. And the spirit carries me through my own fruitcake-baking for the season. <br />The other Christmas story in this collection, entitled &quot;One Christmas,&quot; is probably my favorite short story of all time; the ending always makes me cry as few writings can. The story is a perfect, crystalline window into Truman Capote's soul as shaped by his sad childhood. Utterly heartbreaking. If you are looking for a gift for someone who celebrates Christmas and does not have the good fortune to have read these beautiful stories, this is the perfect little gift.<br />Do not be tempted to read these stories any other time of year. Keep these stories sacred to the season.	2003-02-07

I have read this cookbook from cover to cover and learned an incredible lot. It's the chemistry in cooking and baking that you need to know, if you want to understand recipes, make them work, and even be able to alter them to your tastes. I had devised a cookie recipe that was perfect except that the cookies didn't brown enough on top; this book taught me about adding just a bit of baking soda to counteract the acidity and increase browning. But, oh my, if there's one recipe that you must try, it's Shirley Corriher's Touch-of-Grace Biscuits -- the most feather-light, utterly heavenly biscuits I have ever tasted! No wonder these biscuits are famous among foodies. These biscuits are my family's favorite, the only ones they want. In short, this is a terrific cookbook that is a must for serious cooks and bakers.	2002-10-24

For a while I had been struggling to make Korean dishes using an English translation of a cookbook originally published in Korea; the translation was poor, recipes were hard to understand, and ingredients were not well-described and were hard to find. Finally, here is an authentic Korean cookbook that makes sense to an English-speaker like me who did not grow up with this cuisine, that takes the mystery out of the ingredients with clear descriptions and close-up color photos. Korean cuisine makes sense to me now. The recipes in this book are well-written and well-organized, and the step-by-step photos are invaluable. It doesn't hurt that the author is the owner of the world-famous Woo Lae Oak restaurants, which happen to be my husband's and my favorite. My husband, who grew up with Korean food, says the recipes are authentic. All I know is that the recipes work, and Korean cooking is a lot less mysterious now! Highly recommended.	2002-06-27

This memoir is so completely engrossing, I stayed up until 2 a.m. last night just because I had to know the ending. The surprise is, the last couple of pages left me sobbing so hard I couldn't sleep. It is a beautifully written account of the author's increasing emotional and physical distance from her mother as her mother descends into rage and abusiveness stemming, the author learns only too late, from early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The author's emotions seem so controlled through it all, even after she learns of the diagnosis and of its genetic implications, one might think her unfeeling. But her pain and the pathos  are inescapable in a unnerving way. Unforgettable.	2002-03-20

I was thrilled to find this book, which happens to include a recipe I had been seeking (and begging from Chinese bakeries, to no avail) for the last six years. You know how you walk into any Chinese bakery in the United States and see a range of treats,  from the very traditional Chinese ones to the peculiarly Chinese renditions of baked goods in the European and American traditions? Well, this book presents recipes for lots and lots of Chinese-bakery treats, covering the whole range, from east to west.<br />Among the more traditional Chinese treats are moon cakes filled with sweet red bean paste surrounding a savory egg yolk, little cakes of  chewy pineapple filling wrapped in a short-crust pastry, savory curry and pork pies, little eggy custard tarts, and the childhood favorite of mine whose recipe eluded me all these years: &quot;bo lo mien bao, &quot;commonly known as &quot;pineapple buns&quot; even though there is no pineapple in it, because of the pattern made when the crusty golden topping cracks during baking, and in this book inartfully called &quot;Rolls with Scaly Crust&quot; but absolutely delicious! For afficionados of Chinese baking, this book gives recipes for making the mysterious &quot;Invert Syrup&quot; and &quot;Lye&quot; I have seen referred to but not explained in some old recipes.<br />As for the traditionally European and American bakery treats, what I love is that these are the typically Chinese renditions of western favorites. If you have not been to a Chinese bakery and tasted the way the Chinese and other Asian peoples like their western baked goods to taste (and think they should taste!), just imagine a world in which yeasted bread loaves, rolls, buns, and doughnuts are all made with a white and fluffy sweet-roll dough, even when the treats that are filled with savory fillings. Imagine cakes with the finest, fluffiest of textures: American Strawberry Cake; Vanilla Chiffon Cake, Chocolate Chiffon Cake; Raisin Swiss Roll, and the deliciously different Cheddar Cheese Cake. Evaporated milk is widely used in Chinese baking in place of fresh milk, but some of the recipes call for fresh milk or cream, such as Caramel Pudding and Chocolate Chiffon Pie. The techniques given for Basic Pie Shell dough and the Basic Tart Shell dough are unconventional, but, as once could say is the theme of this entire collection, that's the Chinese take on it!<br />I highly recommend this book to bakers who want to create Chinese-bakery favorites at home, especially to those who are always feeling that they live too far away from a Chinese bakery or who like western bakery treats the way they are made in Chinese bakeries. Beautiful color photographs of the finished items as well as step-by-step color photos of many of the techniques. Clear Instructions in English and Chinese. Avoirdupois and metric measurements.

I am really big on Martha Pearl Villas's recipes because there is an elegant simplicity in her tastes, and this is true even of the richest desserts in this book. Often amusingly bossy and opinionated, she is absolutely adamant about not &quot;tarting up&quot; a dessert with extraneous flavors or ingredients. I tried her Confederate Peach Cobbler recently, and it was a real success with my family, including my thinks-he-is-a-food-critic husband. The fresh peaches were cooked just right -- not too sweet and neither too firm nor too soft -- in a crystal-clear filling that let the marvelous peach flavors come through, unobscured by unnecessary spices and extracts. The rich biscuit crust made with heavy cream was scrumptious, the perfect counterpoint to the simple filling. Another great example of such elegant simplicity is the Pineapple Upside-Down Cake, which also came out utterly delectable when I tried it recently. This upside-down cake was not cloyingly sweet like some, for it had just the right amount of brown sugar and butter glazing the pineapples and cherries, and the cake underneath was a simple sponge that was the perfect foil for the rich, caramelized glaze. Though definitely highly caloric, this cake, with its clear fruit flavors and light sponge base, seemed so light that I, surprisingly, felt I could have finished the entire cake in one sitting. I am looking forward to trying all of the recipes in this book. In short, you will find that Martha Pearl Villas does not &quot;re-invent&quot; (i.e., adulterate) the old Southern favorites just to sell a cookbook; these recipes are the real thing. I highly recommend (and own) all of Martha Pearl Villas's cookbooks for their very Southern emphasis on good, true flavors.	2001-08-29

He was given this book as a gift a year ago and now, five years old, he still has not tired of these wonderful board games. He asks me or his father to play these games with him nearly every day -- and that's the ultimate endorsement of a toy by a child, I'd say. You would have to see how thrilled my son gets, how he laughs, as he plays these games; my words can't convey his utter delight. The illustrations are lively and colorful and absolutely stunning; they look a bit like the amazing high-tech animation seen in the recent movies &quot;Antz&quot; and &quot;A Bug's Life.&quot; These games not only amuse but teach as well. Playing these games, my son has learned counting, taking turns, game strategy, sportsmanship, and lots more. The fact that the three game pieces attach by velcro to the book makes this book portable, packable, and terrific for car and plane trips. Now this is the gift I choose most frequently when looking for a gift for other little children. As a parent, I highly recommend it!	2001-08-29

The Chinese cookbooks published by Wei-chuan (a cooking school in Taipei that is essentially the Cordon Bleu of Taiwan) are my bibles, and I don't bother with any other Chinese cookbooks. The recipes in this book are utterly delectable and absolutely authentic, using traditional ingredients and methods -- no shortcuts or substitutions here. For example, you will not find, as in other, less authentic cookbook recipes, peanut butter being substituted for sesame paste. Even though I live in the United States and do not read or speak Chinese, I have not had a problem finding these authentic ingredients in Asian food stores, especially because the ingredients are often pictured in photographs and the text is in both English and Chinese, so that I can even point out the photo or Chinese words for the store clerk if need be. This book is a great addition to any Chinese cookbook library because Cantonese cuisine is so distinctive for its elegantly simple flavors and sauces, a wonderful contrast to the more complex, sophisticated cuisines of Shanghai or Beijing. If you are serious about Chinese cuisine, this book and the others by Wei-chuan are the best you can buy in the English language.	2001-07-25

I find myself consulting it at least once a day, not just for meal-planning and specific recipes -- and all the recipes I have tried are utterly delectable and fool-proof like all of Christopher Kimball's well-tested and well-reasoned recipes -- but also to help me in devising my own recipes or modifying recipes to my taste. That's the beauty of Kimball's reasoned approach: once you understand how ingredients and techniques work, you are able to amazing things! With what I have learned, I have &quot;perfected&quot; my chocolate-chunk cookies to make them denser and chewier as I like them; my baking powder biscuits by using tenderizing buttermilk and the right proportion of lard to butter; my pizza dough to make it more crispy and chewy by putting the olive oil on, not in, it; etc. Also, my meats are cooked perfectly every time, using Kimball's cooking temperatures and cooking times, for he has tested all the possibilities for you and set forth the results in useful charts.

The authors present thoughtful analyses of the social and cultural context in which the courtship, marriage, and trial took place. One thinks, this was the 1920s, but is the United States today all that far removed from the types of thinking that made such a horrific, shaming trial possible? Maybe not.

I have all three of Martha Pearl's cookbooks, including this latest, and I love them all. She's witty, she's opinionated, and she's sometimes hilariously dictatorial (&quot;Don't be uppity about using canned salmon if you don't have fresh .... You really can't tell the difference&quot; in this molded salad.) Martha Pearl's got some seventy years of experience giving parties, and y'all can tell she knows how to throw a party, southern-style! The recipes are very practically organized into complete (and I mean complete!) menus, each comprising seven or eight items, from the pre-dinner drinks and punches all the way to the desserts. Each menu makes for a lavish spread of elegantly simple foods that are just delicious. I have never tried a Martha Pearl recipe that wasn't utterly delectable. In addition to the customary holiday celebrations throughout the year, for which this book offers a wealth of good recipes and fresh ideas for entertaining, this book inspires me to want to give parties I never thought of before, like a Spend-the-Day Fruitcake Party (y'all bring your own dried and candied fruits to snip and soak, and luncheon  will be served while y'all take a break at some point); a Gumbo Night; an After-Shopping Brunch (any excuse to throw a party!); a Tots' Jingle-Bell Party; etc. Martha Pearl's evident love for giving a good party is contagious. Having her recipes and party-planning tips is like having her in the kitchen with me, and she's like everyone's favorite grandmother: inspiring, dependable, and just delightful. If Martha Pearl comes out with a fourth cookbook, I'll have to have it!	2001-07-20

I took this cookbook with me when my family was relocated, for my husband's job, to live in Silicon Valley for three months in a corporate apartment and forced to make do with a bare-bones kitchen containing three foil-thin skillets and a rectangular Pyrex baking pan. Amazingly, these recipes were simple enough that I was able to make easy and delicious meals everyday with a minimum of implements and without need for fancy ingredients. This is, simply put, real folks' home-cooking. By the way, you have got to try Irma Lee  Stratton's Chocolate Dump Cake! It is the chocolate cake recipe I had been searching for, the moistest and fudgiest chocolate cake I have ever had. You won't even want to add frosting, it's that good!	2001-06-30
US	52958377	R2MAKVPST4VB4M	0399145346	134975297	A Gracious Plenty	Books	5	20	21	N	N	A treasury of the best of old-time southern recipes	This is a cookbook I turn to all the time. I get homesick for the South (where I grew up) whenever I look at these evocative black-and-white photos that reveal vistas into the Southern way of life -- the church supper, the front porch where someone sits shelling beans, the hot and steamy kitchen where dinner rolls sit rising. I also love reading the reminiscences in this book written by various Southerners. All the essays make my heart ache, but one especially took me back, to the long hot summer I spent in the poor black town of Mound Bayou, Mississippi, in the midst of the civil rights struggles of the Freedom Riders. Most importantly, these recipes are real, culled from community cookbooks, and representative of the best of Southern cooking, from humble water-and-cornmeal cakes to the ethereal Forgotten Kisses served at the  finest luncheons. Just the other evening, I made Aunt Effie's Custard Johnny Cake for the first time, having heard it described as one of the best recipes in the collection, and I have decided that this one recipe alone is worth the price of the book! Mmmmm-mmmmm. This book is a must-have for lovers of good Southern food.	2001-06-22

Besides being a good read, with Kimball's charming reminiscences of growing up in a quaint Vermont country town, this cookbook is a treasure because of the multitude of absolutely reliable recipes for the best country cooking to be had! I just love this cookbook, and it is the first one I reach for when making meals everyday for my family. It is full of recipes for the type of good, hearty, down-home cooking that you grew up with and/or crave. These recipes are so thoroughly tested and well explained that they are, well, fool-proof. Kimball tells you why and how. All the recipes I have tried have been superb. The chicken pot pie is homey and satisfying. The buttermilk biscuits are so tender and fluffy and high, I threw away my old biscuit recipe and will not make biscuits any other way now. The buttermilk pancakes are the best and most tender I have ever had -- the secret is in the egg whites. Read why inexpensive cast-iron cookware is all you need for good cooking. Now I understand why my expensive Calphalon pans and non-stick coatings have long disappointed me. As soon as I had finished reading this book cover to cover, I bought a cast-iron Dutch oven and two skillets,  and now I am cooking happy. If you want a cookbook to cook real meals by, this is the one!!!	2001-01-31

The recipes are authentic, letting one create the type of Cantonese dim sum treats one finds in Chinatowns or in Hong Kong. (For Taiwanese-style or Peking-style dim sum, my favorite is Wei-Chuan's cookbook in this series, entitled _Chinese Snacks_.) Be advised, though, that many of the recipes in this book specify quantities of ingredients by weight, both in metric and in avoirdupois/imperial/ounces, so a food scale is useful to have when using this book.	2000-12-20

This is one of my all-time favorite books, and I keep extra copies in various rooms around the house. In this delightful collection of essays, each devoted to a particular pleasure at risk of being forgotten in our  busy lives, Barbara Holland eloquently and wittily persuades us to succumb  to guilty indulgences such as bare feet, happy hour, chicken gravy, and  calling in sick. She also celebrates the unabashed pleasures such as  weekends, dawdling over the  morning paper, gardening, and idle summer  vacations. Ms Holland covers 67 pleasures in all, some of which you will  instantly recognize, some of which it is never too late to start indulging  in, and others that are just downright dangerous! Extremely engaging and  often laugh-out-loud funny, this is a book to dip into every now and then,  as a delicious antidote to the strains and stresses of modern life. It  makes an excellent gift for any of the overworked, abstemious persons you  know, including yourself.	1999-11-09

The retail-price-guide charts on  diamonds are excellent; you can know whether the price being quoted to you  is reasonable. This book taught me how to how to use a jeweler's loupe  properly, to evaluate all types of gemstones.

Here, you will not find, as in some other  cookbooks I have seen, the chicken being boiled when the traditional recipe  calls for steaming, or julienned carrots substituted for the julienned  bamboo traditionally used in the dish. This book and the other, more  specialized Chinese cookbooks published by Wei-Chuan (the venerated and  most famous cooking school in Taiwan), are the only Chinese cookbooks I  use. _Chinese Cuisine_ lets me create exactly the Chinese dishes I loved as  a child, for it's the very same book that my mother used, albeit in an  earlier edition, as a young wife and mother in Taiwan.<br />These recipes are  thoroughly tested, both by the Wei-chuan cooking school and by generations  of students and readers. As an American-raised Chinese who knew little to  begin with about Chinese cooking methods, I have made about half of the  recipes in the book and had spectacular results every time. Each recipe is  meticulously laid out, step by step, and accompanied by a glorious,  mouth-watering photograph of the finished dish. In each recipe, photographs  also demonstrate specialized techniques called for by the recipe. I also  find very helpful the introductory section of the book that describes and  shows clear photographs of the sometimes unusual fresh produce and  preserved foods that are used in the recipes, so that someone unfamiliar  with them could walk into an Asian food store and buy them by sight, or  even by pointing out the picture and Chinese name of the food to a sales  clerk, as I have sometimes done. Also valuable is the introductory section  setting forth sample menues for family meals as well as multi-course feasts  and explaining the traditional principles that the Chinese  have always  used in selecting the combination of dishes for a meal.<br />This wonderful  book, along with the other Wei-Chuan Chinese cookbooks, is the only one I  recommend when westerners ask me which Chinese cookbook to get. It's the  best!ok, along with the other Wei-Chuan Chinese cookbooks, is the only one I  recommend when westerners ask me which Chinese cookbook to get. It's the  best!	1999-01-14
US	52958377	RWS8WKP7012CI	0684813483	911059235	The Pie and Pastry Bible	Books	5	40	41	N	N	A must for every pie-crust lover.	As someone who had tried various pie-crust recipes over the years and never gotten it quite right, reading Berenbaum's aptly named bible was a revelation. The complex and rather unorthodox techniques for cutting in fat  into the flour had me skeptical at first but, having tried several of the  various crust recipes in this book, I will never make a crust the easy old  way again. If you want to make consistently perfect, by which I mean  delectably tender and flaky, crust, this book is for you. The cream-cheese  crust that Berenbaum calls the soul of her book is alone worth the price of  the book. <br />In addition, there's the fool-proof technique  for ensuring an  apple pie in which the juices cling just so to the apple slices yet puddle  just a little on the plate -- no more runny apple pies. The multi-step  technique, which involves macerating the apple slices, draining the liquid  that forms, and boiling down the liquid to a syrup before baking, is  time-consuming, but the results are worth it. I tried the apple pie recipe,  and my husband rated it a 10! I am one reader who will never again simply  toss the apple slices in sugar and bake, on the off-chance that the liquids  might (or might not) reduce enough during baking. <br />The book is invaluable  also for the understanding it gives the reader of how the various  ingredients in pie crust work, e.g., why the addition of baking powder to  pie crust is  a must for flakiness, why the crust dough needs to be kneaded  harder and longer to make it strong enough to wrap around a meat loaf or  the filling of a turnover, etc. <br />I could go on and on about the merits of  this book. Although I wish no one else would read it so that I could be the  only person in the world (besides the author) who can make marvelous crust,  I cannot help thinking this is a book that should not be kept a secret.	1998-12-27
