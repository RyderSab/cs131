The Los Angeles Times first exposed Dux as a fraud after the movie Bloodsport was released. After The Secret Man came out, author B.G. Burkett examined Dux's military records which reveal that Dux never left California during his less than 6 months with the Marine Corps. You can read the entire, bizarre, and sad account in Burkett's book, Stolen Valor. Dux's entire military career as a secret operative is a total fantasy.	2004-11-16

Many of his verdicts in Cook County were the result of his bribes to selected jurors. He lost his most famous cases- Loeb and Leopold, and Scopes. Darrow was driven by a hardline socialist dogma, but he still represented corporations when he needed the money. Irving Stone, the author, has been revealed as a Soviet agent in the Venona transcripts. His views about Darrow are biased with his twisted view of American society. If you read this book,realize that it is not an objective biography about Darrow, but a propaganda piece instead.	2004-02-09

Mailer hero-worshipped Ali, and could never write anything objective about him. Mailer knew nothing about boxing, other than the sensation of hitting a woman in one of his drunken binges. Mailer went to Africa, and could not write the truth about Zaire or its bloodthirsty dictator. He either did not know or could not write that the stadium in which the fight was held, for example, was a killing field for criminals who were rounded up before the fight to make sure the event went smoothly for the press and the tourists.	2002-03-13

I have read Islam Revealed and find it to be a very good book about Islam.  Dr. Shorrosh is a Palestinian Arab, has lived most of his life around Muslims,and has debated the subject of Islam for years.<BR>  Dr. Shorrosh critically examines the life of Muhammad and the history of Islam, including the violent battles waged against any people who did not accept Islam as a revealed religion. To this day Islam is a religion that encourages violences against any who do not accept its teachings. Dr. Shorrosh also reveals the tremendous number of historical errors and contradictions in the Quaran concerning, among others, the genealogy of Abraham; the life of Moses; the error of confusing Mary, the mother of Jesus, as the sister of Aaron; the error as to the birthplace of Jesus; and the life of Jesus.<BR>   Dr. Shorrosh also writes extensively about the inferior role of women in Islam. A Muslim husband may divorce his wife without a single reason and may have up to 4 wives. He may beat his wives if they disobey him. <BR>   For those who are interested in a scholarly, historical and theological comparison between Christianity and Islam, this book is an excellent start.	2001-12-30

Jimmy Carter must be ranked among our weakest and most ineffectual modern Presidents, and this book fails to take a truly critical examination of Carter and his failed domestic and foreign policies.  Upon entering office,  Jimmy Carter slashed our military budget and tried to cozy up to the  Soviets.  Their response was to invade several countries, mainly through  their proxies. When the Soviets marched into Afghanistan, Carter's response  was to withdraw from the Olympics. After the US embassy was taken over in  Iran, Carter tried to appease the Iranians, and then launched a failed and  inept rescue mission, which epitomizes Carter's foreign and military  record.   On the domestic front, it wasn't much better.  Energy prices  skyrocketed, inflation was rampant, and taxation rose, along with interest  rates.  Carter's response was to create more government entitlement  programs, and accuse the citizenry of malaise.    Very, very little was  accomplished during the Carter years, as he was a weak, highly flawed  little man out of his element on the world stage.	1999-12-14

I don't buy the argument, advanced by some of the reviewers, that Jimmy Carter is a great ex-President.  I belong to the camp that believes that Jimmy Carter is not only a failed President but a failed ex-President as  well. Carter prides himself as our unappointed world ambassador, but I  believe history will show that he is ineffectual and meddlesome.  In  Nicarauga, for example, Carter strongly believed that the Sandanistas would  win the free elections, as Carter had encouraged the overthrow of Somoza  and welcomed the Sandanistas as liberators.  Carter opposed the Persian  Gulf War, and appeased the North Koreans when he travelled there.    Other  than write a handful of mediocre books, I can't think of a single  constructive, intelligent thing Carter has done since he has left office.  Nixon, with all of his flaws, was at least considered a statesman by not  only Reagan and Bush, but Clinton as well.  I doubt history will record  that any active President ever followed Jimmy Carter's advice on any issue  of national importance.	1999-12-14

It's also unfortunate  that RFK did not disclose the truth about the secret deals he and JFK made  in exchange for the removal of the missiles- our promise not to invade  Cuba, and our removal of the Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

In  office, Carter proved to be a petty, self-righteous little man who was  overwhelmed by the presidency.  He was not a leader- he was a bureaucrat.

It turned out to be an excellent novel, with a strong story line and sympathetic main character. Brian Jones is not the  main character, as the story is told from the perspective of a young  English girl. The book, however, evokes the sense of loss and tragedy that  many of us felt when Brian Jones died. There is a sense of innocence about  the book that is quite touching.     Incidentally, I am an adult male, and  this book is not just for the female fans.  I quite enjoyed it and highly  recommend it. I look forward to the author's next work.	1999-09-27

Mr. Grisham is supposed to be an attorney, but fails to get any of the legal details correct. For example, the defense attorney in this book  attempts to remove the case to federal court by filing a motion in state  court!  The only proper procedure to remove a case filed in state court to  is to file a notice of removal in federal court. The author's description  of bad faith law is also laughable- even a first year law student could do  a better job of getting the law right.  A great deal of time is spent in  the book concerning the removal of a letter by the insurance company from  its claim file. But what is the point of removing a letter that has already  been mailed?  If a company were going to conceal a document, it would  conceal a document that the plaintiff has never seen, or heard about.  Next, the main character is seriously flawed, and is no hero. In no  particular order of importance, he is guilty of practicing law without a  license, drunk driving, forming a partnership with a non-lawyer, improperly  soliciting clients, and murder. Just who is the bad guy here???  Grisham  completely misses the boat in this book.  It would not have taken a great  deal of effort to get the details correct.  Instead, he loses all  credibility as an author, especially an author of legal novels. Imagine, if  you will, a writer of Western novels having his hero mount a horse from the  right side, or saddle the horse backwards, and not have his readers laugh  at the absurdity of his effort.	1999-09-15

The major character of the book is an abortionist, whom the author portrays as a heroine.  The author  is obviously a liberal, and strongly pro-abortion, and felt the need to use  this genre to advance his views on the subject.
