US	50820963	RUT3VDZX5N7CP	0385511612	430694437	Bleachers	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Brief tale, well written -- Excellent Read	I think that I'm getting to the point where I look forward more to John Grisham's non- thriller books.  Granted that Grisham earned his considerable fortune writing about idealistic law school graduates fighting big corporations and a cynical legal system, but Bleachers is a prime example of what can happen when a skilled writer decides to stretch his creative muscles and move away from the security of an enjoyable formula.<br /><br />Neely Crenshaw is a former high school hero, returning to his small home town to await the imminent death of it's legendary football coach, the one that torments his psyche and that of so many of his teammates.  We come to know Eddie Rake as the builder of a high school football powerhouse, a man with an athletic philosophy akin to Vince Lombardi and Bear Bryant; and a man that left an indelible mark - some good, and some bad - on every player he coached.<br /><br />Much of the story is revealed in the conversations of Crenshaw and his teammates, as they gather to memorialize Rake along with the positive and negative aspects of his legacy.  It's a brief book, but Grisham reveals secrets with a marvelous pacing that left me satisfied.  Conversations early on refer to the coach's firing, and then provide the details much later when the reader can better appreciate them.  The source for Crenshaw's particular antipathy to his one-time mentor is revealed piecemeal, until you find yourself wondering precisely who was the victim and who the villain.<br /><br />To say more would be giving away too much.  It's not that this is a book about incidents and games, so much as an exploration of character and values.  It's a great read, and I hope that John Grisham is as proud of Bleachers as he should be.	2005-09-12

It often seems that we live in an age when the only significant discoveries are the result of massive expeditions that depend upon millions of dollars in high tech resources and vast support teams that include corporate sponsors and publicists.  Shadow Divers tells a different story, a story of highly skilled (and very courageous) men investing their own time, money and passion for history in the discovery and identification of a sunken German U-boat off the coast of New Jersey.<br /><br />This is not about a search for the riches that might be found in a Spanish galleon, or the historical significance of the Titanic, Andrea Doria or the Lusitania.  The target of the divers was an unknown submarine, a wreck found below 300 feet of ocean in a place where no German U-boat was ever reported lost.  The mystery of the boat's identity, why it was in New Jersey waters, and how it met it's end sent John Chatterton, Ritchie Kohler and their associates on a six year odyssey.  That this mission was a dangerous one is underscored by the fact that three men lost their lives during dives to the wreck they came to refer to as the U-Who.  They operated off a charter boat, basically chipping in for gas money, relying on skill, enthusiasm and bravery.<br /><br />Robert Kurson's telling of this story is fantastic!  He relates the steps of their six year quest and adds to it with poignant explorations of the character and passions that motivated these men to risk their lives to put names and identities to the skeletons - both human and metal - that lay at the bottom of the ocean.  I found myself moving from page to page with the curiosity and anticipation normally engendered by a fictionalized mystery.  But this is a tale of real divers, divers with day jobs - at one point Kohler finishes his conversation with a renowned U-boat historian and drives off to replace the glass for a drive-thru window at a KFC restaurant!<br /><br />You might ask yourself what drove these men to risk their lives?  The answer isn't a simple one, but it revolves around issues of character and commitment.  Kurson leaves you with an appreciation of those qualities, sufficient enough that you'll respect both of them and the other \\"weekend divers\\" that worked to solve the questions of a warship that was supposed to be half a world away from the place where it died.isk their lives?

First, the legendary rocker Jimmy Stoma dies under somewhat suspect circumstances, and now someone is picking off the members of his backup band, The Slut Puppies.  Only in the South Florida world of Carl Hiassen can murder be this funny!  And that's not to denigrate the quality of the mystery that takes the reader through intrigues in the music business, corporate journalism, the South Beach club scene and soft core internet porn.  The twist at the end is about as original as anything I've read in a long while.<br /><br />The protagonist of this romp is Jack Tagger, a cynical soon-to-be 47 year old writer of newspaper obituaries whose obsession with famous dead people that checked out at his age has cost him more than a few girl friends and monthly doctor's exams.  Jack wasn't always this way, okay well he was always cynical; but his once thriving front page career has been derailed by some inappropriate public comments directed to the new owners of his employer.  When the report of the drowning death of Jimmy Stoma triggers a few questions, he realizes that this could be the story that springs him from journalistic exile, releasing him from under the thumb of his twenty something female editor.<br /><br />The cast of characters is vintage Hiassen!  There is the bereaved widow that uses her husband's funeral to plug her next CD, and her music producer that has appropriated a cosmetics brand as his name.  The sister of the deceased supports herself via online appearances as Rita the Meter Maid and a female SWAT officer (no nudity of course).  The newspaper staff includes the aforementioned editor (did I mention her sexy toenails?), a sportswriter that longs to become a serious novelist, and a J school intern that plans to move on to law school after graduation.<br /><br />I should also mention that in his first physical confrontation with the bad guys, Tagger resorts to the use of a three foot, frozen lizard as his defensive weapon of choice.  If that doesn't pique your interest enough to get you to read the book, I don't know that will.pique your interest enough to get you to read the book, I don't know that will. <br />	2005-08-22

A look at our "friends" the Saudis	This is a story that is rarely told, and even more infrequently, told well.  Carmen bin Laden relates the story of her marriage to a member of what is perhaps the most influential non-royal family in Saudi Arabia.  Yes, it's that bin Laden family.  Her former husband, Yeslam, is an older half-brother of the infamous Osama.<br /><br />The family and their umbrella company, the bin Laden Organization owe their wealth and influence to Sheik Mohammed bin Laden, the deceased patriarch, who built a small construction business into what might be described as the Saudi equivalent of Halliburton.  With the bin Laden Organization winning the right to supervise and effect the renovation of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, the family's influence was solidified for good.<br /><br />Carmen is the daughter of an Iranian mother and Swiss father.  She grew up in Switzerland, with frequent trips to visit her grandmother in pre-Revolutionary Iran.  While she was raised Muslim, the traditions and strictures of the Saudis that she encountered after her marriage where far more confining and archaic than she ever expected.  From the restrictive confines of the abaya, the head to toe covering of Saudi women, to prohibitions against conversation or interaction with men other than her husband, Carmen found herself a prisoner in her own home.<br /><br />Carmen's difficulties have little to do with Islam, but the Wahhabi sect of Islam that dominates life in Saudi Arabia.  Her stories and anecdotes of life under a harsh social system that has clear delineations between Saudi men and woman, Saudis and non-Saudis, make for fascinating reading.  It also give a tiny bit of insight into the religious fanaticism of her former brother-in-law and his followers.  If the Saudis are supposed to be our best friends among the Arabs, my hopes for a more peaceful world have been severely damaged.<br /><br />I suspect that the author has tempered some of her stories in the desire to protect her daughters from reprisals, but she offers sufficient tales to give a clear understanding of the restrictions and biases against women within Saudi culture.  One such story deals with the trouble that she had in merely having a carpet laid to her satisfaction, barred as she was from speaking directly to the workers.  Or the difficulties in dealing with male employees that will not take orders from a woman.  I can't help but wonder that if a woman within a moneyed and prominent family should encounter such a stifling existence, how bad must it be for women in the middle or lower classes?m reprisals, but she offers sufficient tales to give a clear understanding of the restrictions and biases against women within Saudi culture.

Many good writers are capable of producing an excellent trilogy based on the same complete set of characters, however after book three their output tends to be uneven at best (think Frank Herbert with the Dune series, or even Arthur C. Clark with his Rama novels).  But Rowling not only sustains the story line, her writing seems to improve with each effort.<br /><br />Harry and his friends are back at Hogwarts for their sixth year, 16 years old and suffering from all the usual teen agonies.  There are relationships to maintain, both romantic and platonic; academic tribulations, issues of trust, politics and more.  Through it all, you find yourself hurrying from page to page because you're curious about what happens next or because you just care about Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore and everyone else.  There are no cheap tricks here, you might expect that given the whole wizarding theme of the series, that one or more situation might be resolved by just a casual, unexplained flick of the wand, but no.  Harry can be as tenacious as one of Scott Turow's lawyers.  Hermione does her research in the library, sans Internet (not that there is anything wrong with the Internet of course... ).<br /><br />As far as the plot goes, the threat posed by Voldemort is growing, with Harry and other students imperiled by his Death Eater followers.  Thankfully for Harry (and us readers) Quidditch is once again being contested, providing a great diversion as well as more and more insight into the various relationships that complicate the lives of the teenage protagonists.  Beyond that, events unfold that drive the story to the end of the Hogwarts' school year, setting things up quite nicely for the final book in the series.  Now, you don't really want me to divulge any more detail than that do you?<br /><br />As always, the story of Harry and his friends will satisfy young readers (or listeners being read to by parents or siblings).  Or if you are an adult looking for additional depth and thematic elements, you might discover plenty of references to the global war on terror, journalistic and academic ethics, corporate corruption and the politics of personality.  Is that pithy enough for you?<br /><br />Oh... yes, there is a new teacher at Hogwarts, a name dropping self promoter that might give Gilderoy Lockhart a run for his money; Professor Dumbledore still reveals his secrets only when he's ready, and Severus Snape is just as ambiguously evil as ever.<br /><br />I'd be tempted to beg Ms. Rowling to publish her next book as soon as possible, but given the quality of the first six, I can almost, almost be content waiting for her to release it only when she's ready.

And even fewer have Carl Hiaasen's ability to craft sentence after sentence of dialogue and observations that can have you laughing aloud while one character physically abuses another.  If that sounds a bit strange... well... guilty as charged!<br /><br />The sick puppy of the title is a lovable lump of a labrador retriever that eats almost anything, including the glass eyes of taxidermied big game.  His erstwhile caretaker is Twilly Spree, a devout anti-litter campaigner with an anger management problem and a lot of very creative ideas about how to reek havoc on people that carelessly dump their trash.  He's joined by the wife of a powerful Florida lobbyist, a crazy ex-governor who favors road kill meals, and a cast of other south Florida crooks, politicos and perverts.<br /><br />It sounds like a dreadful mishmash, but in the deft hands of Carl Hiaasen it makes for a most enjoyable read.  I could give you more detailed character descriptions or plot features (as some other reviewers have already done here), and it wouldn't detract from the fun of reading the book.

Yet Dr. Smith was not content to allow his words to become dated, and we are all the better for it.  Some of the changes might be regarded as more or less stylistic, such as rendering the title and text more gender neutral and thus more reflective of current thinking.  Other additions include a discussion of the aboriginal philosophies of native Americans, Australians and Pacific Islanders.  However the core appeal of this book comes from Dr. Smith's ability to illuminate the core principals and philosophies of each religion with both respect and admiration.<br /><br />Smith states his purpose early on as an exploration of ideas and beliefs.  And he explicitly warns that this book \\"is not a balanced account of it's subject.\\"  Accordingly, \\"this is a book about values\\" not religious history.  As such it forms an excellent basis from which a person might broaden their understanding of the major religions of the world.  This is reinforced at the end of each chapter with the author's suggestions for sources of additional reading and exploration.<br /><br />Given the immensity of his subject matter, I'm amazed that Dr. Smith was able to keep his book at a manageable size.  There are so many branches and divisions within the various religions that a less disciplined scholar might become lost in, adding pages and pages of minutiae that might otherwise obscure the overall purpose of relating how people of different faiths define and seek to become closer to God.<br /><br />I might issue one caveat to \\"index-browsers\\" like myself, who check out the index for areas of interest prior to beginning the book.  There are some topics, like Mormonism, the Bahai beliefs, Scientology and current trends in religious fundamentalism that are given cursory or no discussion.

But I couldn't understand how an American electorate could buy it all hook, line and sinker.  It's the framing!<br /><br />We've been lost in the wilderness of facts and logic so long, that we've forgotten how to communicate, while the members of the Radical Right have been refining their skills in presenting their message.<br /><br />Lakoff's premise, clearly explained in terms of linguistics and communication, is that the framing of the message strengthen and reinforces it before it ever is delivered.  It's not a cynical manipulation of language, but a skillful application of classic presentation skills.<br /><br />We (those of the liberal persuasion) have been listening to ad men, political consultants and pundits far too long.  We forget that there are other frames (perspectives) from which people might view the same message.  Consider the contrasting metaphores that Lakoff uses throughout, that of the Strict Father or the Nurturing Parent.  The Radical Right embrace the Strict Father.  Progressives and Liberals favor the Nurturing Parent.<br /><br />Once you begin to look past the words and consider the way the message is... and can be... framed, you'll better understand how we can reverse the trends of the past two election cycles and focus on bringing positive change that betters and strengthens America.<br /><br />I'm buying some copies for my friends!

If your political reading interests center around partisan commentary - whether from pundits of the left or the right - do yourself a favor and pass on this book.  Michael Moore, Bill O'Reilly, Al Franken or Ann Coulter will have another, more entertaining missive out any day now and you can reinforce your righteous anger at will.  If you are more inclined to dive into a factual and thought-provoking analysis of the war between Al Qaeda and the U.S., one would be hard pressed to find a better source of information.<br /><br />Let's put Imperial Hubris into it's proper perspective.  It is the work of Michael Scheuer, who has spent the past twenty-plus years gathering and analyzing information pertinent to the regimes and conflicts of the middle east.  His concern is that numerous political and religious agendas are being confused with the primary one of protecting the interest of Americans at home and abroad.  Well trained analyst that he is, Scheuer builds a case for viewing the \\"war on terrorism\\" with a fresh set of eyes that view the conflict from all sides, not just one.  Whether in a war between nations or a less lethal contest between disagreeing parties, one of the quickest routes to defeat is to discount your enemy as simply being \\"against\\" you and your values.  You need to assess your own behavior, as well as your strengths and weaknesses from your opponent's perspective in order to better counter their attack.<br /><br />Hubris, exaggerated pride or self-confidence, can bring down even the strongest of armies.  It is hubris to say that Osama bin Laden and his followers hate us because we are free.  Yes, they hate America, but it has nothing to do with our freedom or our democracy.  They hate us because they perceive America to be a threat to Islam.  Scheuer doesn't accuse the American government or the American people as wanting to destroy Islam, but he can describe how some of our actions might be perceived through Islamic eyes as trying to accomplish just that.<br /><br />As another example, in our hubris, we tend to paint bin Laden as an isolated, evil criminal, acting out against the modern society of the West.  Shockingly enough (to many Americans) there are millions of Islamists that see him as more of a \\"defender of the faith\\".  That dichotomy of image illustrates the danger we face in trying to defend ourselves against his army.  Dismissing him and his followers as mad renegades is a classical blunder of onerous proportions.<br /><br />What raises this book above the babble, is Scheuer's willingness to provoke debate.  He doesn't claim to have all of the answers, but clearly he asks a number of questions that should be (or should have been) asked of our political and military leaders.  Too many of these questions have been shot down by political correctness, partisan politics or global economics before effective answers could be developed.<br /><br />Having seen Mr. Scheuer on various media outlets, I am greatly impressed with his demeanor.  This is a man more comfortable with gathering evidence, more so than leaping to conclusions.  He'll answer a tough question with an appropriately \\"this is how I see it...\\"response, citing factual evidence while acknowledging the opposing view.  Clearly he does not expect everyone to agree with all of his conclusions or recommendations.  Personally, I wouldn't be willing to follow every path that he suggests.  But he does acknowledge the value of open debate, the type of debate that leads to consensus building and clear prioritization of our national interest.

Robert Hartwell Fisk definitely warrants his (self-described?) label of curmudgeon; and  I say that with great admiration.  If you have a long list of grammatical pet peeves, his Dictionary of Disagreeable English will furnish you with an entertaining source for putting people right.  If you couldn't care less about precise English, don't bother.  But if you appreciate the appropriateness of \\"couldn't\\" as opposed to the ghastly \\"could care less\\" that has become so common today, then buy this book in quantity and give it to all of your friends!<br /><br />It is a bit intimidating to write a review of this book, as there is the fear of provoking a mild (or worse) response from the author regarding errors within the review, however I will try.  Fisk provides evidence of errors that range from common misspellings and mispronunciations to such flagrant misuse of words that their meanings are completely distorted.  I was gratified to find the a number of words and phrases that rank among my linguistic pet peeves, and I was shocked to discover too many errors of my own usage.<br /><br />Mr. Fisk chooses his targets carefully, with wit and sarcasm -[...]- such that you can't help but lose time moving from one entry to the next.  He provides examples of each mistaken use, followed by a suggestion that would make the sentence more precise.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, he does not appear to favor a return to the language of the Victorians.  He readily acknowledges that English is a living language, and he even makes a few allowances for the \\"creative\\" use of words by some technical disciplines.  Nonetheless he loudly denounces what I might call Dilbertarian business-speak at every opportunity.  He even coins a new word of his own, \\"lexicographers\\" to refer to dictionaries and editors that are all to willing to bend to the noise of popular vocabulary, at the expense of clear communication.<br /><br />Congratulations Mr. Fisk!

Like many readers of Angels and Demons, I'm curious as to why this novel had to sit in the backwaters of the book sales lists until after it's sequel The Da Vinci Code was discovered.  In many ways this is a superior read; a breakneck pace, more fully developed characters, though perhaps a lesser degree of plausibility.<br /><br />If you forget that A & D came first, you might suspect (as I did) in the early going that Dan Brown was following his Da Vinci formula - Harvard educator and symbologist Robert Landon is rousted by a late night phone call that brings him into the middle of a millennially long conspiracy (propagated by another secret society) that is laid open by a shocking murder.  But this mystery is far more complex than it's successor.<br /><br />The secret society in this case is the Illuminati, allegedly founded by Galileo and his supporters as a science-based foe of the Catholic Church.  With the gruesome murder and mutilation of scientist Leonardo Vetra, the threat to the Vatican (and others) becomes all too evident.  As a scholar and authority on the Illuminati, Langdon's help is requested by the victim's research consortium.  Solving the murder might be sufficient, however there is the issue of some missing antimatter.  And if that's not enough, the antimatter, with it's mega-nuclear destructive power is hidden somewhere in or below the Vatican.  And by the way, it's likely to detonate during a Papal Conclave, destroying Vatican City and a considerable portion of Rome in the process.<br /><br />Langdon is assisted in his chase by the beautiful and brilliant Vittoria Vetra (daughter and research partner of the murder victim).  No, she really didn't have to be beautiful, but then aren't the protagonists of every major thriller supposed to be some form of eye candy?  Note to Central Casting, how about Harrison Ford and Angelina Jolie for the movie?<br /><br />The Illuminati's hired killer is also a sincerely kinky sort, who adds even greater tension to his obvious menace.  And then there is also an authoritarian wheelchair-bound scientist, a collection of Vatican officials and Swiss Guards who take turns helping and/or hindering the investigation, constantly leaving the reader to wonder who the real conspirators are.<br /><br />It all makes for a memorable read. the plot hurdles along from chapter to chapter, rarely slowing down enough to allow the reader a decent break.

Despite what you might think, Mount Vesuvius is something of a secondary character in this historical novel, even though the reader is well aware of what's in store for the mountain and the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum.  But knowledge of the impending cataclysm only increases the reader's interest with each successive tremor or sulfurous odor.<br /><br />Robert Harris could have opted for a multi-character \\"movie of the week\\" kind of scenario, but instead he focuses more tightly on Attilius, the newly appointed Aquarius (think chief engineer) of the Aqua Augusta, the freshwater lifeline of southern Italy.  It's a good choice, in fact I found the historical details of the Roman aqueducts more fascinating than the volcano; but then I opted for physics rather than geology in high school.  In any case, a disruption to the flow of water to the people around the Bay of Neapolis (Naples) sends Attilius on an expedition to repair the aqueduct and restore the flow of water.<br /><br />If ash and lava pose the more imminent threat, it's water that offers the catalyst and ultimate redemption.  What should be a routine \\"fix and repair\\" operation uncovers further mysteries involving the disappearance of Attilius' predecessor, political corruption and romantic intrigue.  And the presence of Pliny the Elder as a major character offers a number of opportunities for scientific or historical digression, none of which derail the story, thankfully enough.<br /><br />The actual eruption of Vesuvious and its subsequent destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum only constitute the final hundred pages of the book, but the Harris does an excellent job of describing the event as if you were there to witness it.  It's a good book, although not worthy of some of the hype that it's received.	2004-09-15

What sets the \\"Ultimate Kauai Guidebook: Kauai Revealed\\" apart from most is the quality of writing, its organization, and the authors' wit and candor.<br /><br />Too many guidebooks read like they were composed by a subcommitee from the local bureau of tourism; listing every last attraction in breathless prose subtly designed to the wallet of the unwitting traveler.  Doughty and Friedman live on Kauai and make no secret of their affection for the island, but they don't shortchange the reader a bit.  The best locations get highlighted with a \\"not to be missed\\" or \\"a real gem\\" graphic; and the best restaurants are awarded an \\"ono\\" (a Hawaiian word meaning \\"delicious\\").  And they can be brutally frank about those places that fail to meet their standards, one resort in particular gets labelled as \\"a real pit.\\"<br /><br />The authors' attention to detail is especially obvious in the maps, where in some cases the location and number of telephone poles is included to assist in navigating some of the unmarked dirt roads!<br /><br />We just returned from our first visit to Kauai, travelling there with a borrowed copy of the Ultimate Kauai Guidebook.  But after a day or so of following its recommendations and suggestions, we bought our own copy (with two couples in the car, that also made things easier by having one copy for the front seat copy and one in the back).  Finding a copy wasn't difficult at all, it was on sale at the helicopter tour desk, the canteen wagon at the Waimea Canyon lookout and at any number of restaurants or resorts.  But buy your copy before you ever get on the plane.  It's enjoyable reading that will make for a memorable vacation.ng that will make for a memorable vacation.	2004-09-13

It could all happen again!	It's a bit spooky to read this account of events in the Middle East during the decade that bracketed World War, while the occupation and rebuilding of post-Saddam Iraq is unfolding. The parallels (both good and not-so-good) are fascinating, almost to the point where one could substitute current names like Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz and Condoleeza Rice for Lord Kitchener, Lord Asquith and Sir Mark Sykes.<br />More than one scholar has suggested that this work from David Fromkin is a must-read for anyone wanting to understand the roots of the politics and current animosities of the Middle East. I'm no scholar, but I can't imagine another source that could provide a better accounts of the events and personalities from 90 years ago that have shaped (and often misshaped) the most problematic region of the world. The movie &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; may have been cinema at it's best; but it was also history at it's most trivial. This is the real history, laced with context and the full implications of each development.<br />Fromkin relates in fascinating detail the various acts of hubris, misdirection, treachery, imperialism, nation building, cowardice and more that shaped the arbitrary borders and ruling classes of today's Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Iran and Israel. From the Young Turks of the Ottoman Empire to the early leaders of Zionism, each player in this vast geopolitical game comes under the author's critical eye. And Fromkin is impartial with both his praise and his criticism. While his portrait of Winston Churchill tosses body blow or two to Sir Winston's image, it also establishes a firm foundation for those that regard Churchill as one of the most dominate and influential leaders of the twentieth century.<br />Knowledge of mistakes in the past is no guarantee that future mistakes will not occur, but it does help to avoid a repeat of past errors. This book should be required reading for any American concerned with the Middle East, particularly our current leadership!icularly our current leadership!	2004-07-19

The brutal murders of Brenda Lafferty and her infant daughter by Ron and Dan Lafferty are at the center of this examination of Mormon fundamentalism.  If your only exposure to the writing of John Krakauer has been his personal account of an ill-fated Mount Everest expedition (Into Thin Air), you'll be pleased to discover that his abilities as a writer stretch much further than the first person narrative.  Under the Banner of Heaven is an engrossing inspection of religious zealotry focusing on Ron and Dan Lafferty, two Mormon fundamentalists who carried out the murders based upon what they believe were instructions from God.<br />Krakauer augments his story with a basic history of Mormonism that does well to explain it's growth from inception to a religion of prominence in less than two centuries.  At the same time, he shines a perceptive light on some of the idiosyncrasies within Mormon theology that may have contributed to the existence of fundamentalist splinter movements promoting polygamy, misogyny and pedophilia.  There are plenty of simple questions, none of which are met with clear or straightforward answers.  Did the oppression of the early Mormons lead to the development of a subculture of violence in later years?  Was Joseph Smith a prophet, charlatan or religious genius?  And what of the other self-proclaimed prophets, have they truly received revelations from God, are they delusional or mentally ill?<br />One interesting facet of Krakauer's writing here is that he forgoes an aggressively journalistic style of writing in favor of a more direct approach.  By that I mean that he doesn't qualify pieces of narrative by writing that Ron Lafferty \\"allegedly\\" or \\"might\\" have received a revelation, he simply writes that \\"God spoke to Ron.\\"  That might foster disagreement with those of us who might question whether or not Lafferty is a creative liar or some form of schizophrenic, however it makes for a much lucid read; and in any case, Krakauer seems more interested in offering enough evidence to allow the reader to reach their own conclusions within the context of their personal faith.<br />I learned a great deal from this book.  Compared to other religions, Mormonism is a relative newcomer with its inception in the 1820's.  The history of how this religion has grown and sprouted splinter movements of its own is fascinating.  It's these offshoots that have become the most problematic for mainstream Mormons, sowing the seeds for the Lafferty murders, along with the more recent kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart.<br />With this effort, John Krakauer (an agnostic) has produced a fascinating work of history, crime, psychology and theological discussion that will affect you in one way or another.sted in offering enough evidence to allow the reader to reach their own conclusions within the context of their personal faith.<br />I learned a great deal from this book.

You might call it Andromeda Strain meets Jurassic Park since the human-engineered malevolence is at the microscopic level in the form of nanoparticle-sized machines that have escaped from their laboratory and begun reproducing at an alarming rate.<br />The narrator of this adventure, Jack Forman is an expert in distributed programming.  Only now his career has been interrupted by some Silicon Valley backstabbing and innuendo, shifting him into a Mr. Mom role that's no all to all unpleasant save for the suspicion that his newly workaholic wife might be having an affair.  Her job involves a secret Defense project that is trying to create molecule-sized machines for intelligence gathering.  The trouble is, something has gone wrong with the project and Jack's been enlisted to help fix it.  That might sound simple but the tiny nano-machines have evolved into an independent form of life that seems ill-disposed to share space with mammals like rabbits, coyotes... and humans.<br />Crichton's appeal has always been his ability to build an exciting plot around a basic theme of technology exceeding the control of it's inventors.  This is vintage Crichton, not one of his best, but far from his lesser efforts.  He does a better job than usual though, in controlling his urge to educate the scientifically illiterate, limiting his dissertations on next-generation programming and molecular science to only a few paragraphs at a time, rather than going on for pages at a time.  He has also developed more of a flair for characterization, creating a cast that with more emotional and relational range than in many of his previous books.<br />Maybe he does telescope the ending just a bit, but by the time you've confirmed your suspicions as to where the story is heading, you've still had a thoroughly enjoyable ride.	2004-02-09

Reynolds Price provides a wealth of imagination and speculation in this physically small but intellectually expansive book.  Writing as a self-described &quot;outlaw Christian&quot;, he attempts to address Jesus' role or philosophy with regard to topics given relatively short shrift by the Gospels -- homosexuality, suicide and the role of women in the Church.<br />Taking a thought from the &quot;What Would Jesus Do?&quot; (WWJD)fad, Price speculates on how the ethics of Jesus might have led him to react had he been faced with the romantic affections of another man, or the immiment suicide of a follower.  More appealingly, Price never claims to be presenting new theology, only to be offering the basis for continuing consideration of Christ's timeless message.<br />I'm usually quick to reject much of the WWJD speculation for the simple reason that Jesus would likely never have put himself in the position of flirting with more modern temptations such as drug use or fathering a child out of wedlock, but the three scenarios offered by Price are much more plausible.<br />People of faith, who welcome theologic speculation and reverent debate will enjoy this work, as Mr. Price never allows doubt on the divinity of Jesus.  You might agree with his imaginings, or you might believe that he's off base.  But either way, once you've finished this book, you'll be thinking more about Christ and his teachings.  It's not meant to be either a repudiation or augmentation of the Gospels, but it does shine a very interesting light on them.	2004-02-02

From a brief chapter in Genesis, Ms. Diamant constructs a story about the life of Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob (son of Isaac and grandson of Abraham) that is much more rich and detailed than its biblical telling.  She approaches her subject much like a historian intent on finding a new perspective to a much told tale, in this case it's a much more feminine viewpoint that gives this particular novel its vibrancy.  The title refers to the tent used by the women of biblical times during their monthly cycles, a place forbidden to men where the lines of status are blurred and the conversation more personal.<br />If Dinah receives short shrift in the Bible (which she does) it is likely due to the fact that the original writings (and subsequent translations) were masculine in their orientation; call it a gender-based variation on the &quot;history is written by the conquerors&quot; theory.  If you relate the individual events or milestones here in simplistic terms, the story is in basic point by point agreement with the Bible -- Jacob takes four wives, they give him 12 sons and a daughter, the daughter is the catalyst for a violent incident, son Joseph is sold to the Egyptians and ultimately becomes a man of power.  Here, Anita Diamant moves the focus from the men to the women, with Dinah becoming the first person narrator.  The descriptions of people and events then are filtered through her perceptions and related to the reader accordingly.  For example, Joseph is not the son who is horribly wronged and with the help of God rebuilds his life to a position of great power.  Here he is the younger brother of Dinah, whose estrangement from her family occurs well before his.  When she encounters him again, much later in life, she's completely unware of the trials that have formed him and perceives him as perhaps more arrogant and aloof.<br />Some might be inclined to dismiss The Red Tent as a &quot;biblical chick book.&quot;  First and foremost, this is a very well written novel.  Under the pen of a Rabbi this might have taken the form of midrash (a homily on a scriptural passage that serves as an embellishment of the scriptural narrative) a more conclusive interpretation of its lessons; but I think that Ms. Diamant's purpose is more to make us think and discuss rather than to instruct.  If that's true, she succeeds admirably!ot;  First and foremost, this is a very well written novel.

Al Franken takes aim at the conservative politicians and pundits that ride outrageous boasts and accusations to greater power and profit.  It's a simple enough task, you just do a little fact checking or number crunching and voila, the truth is revealed.  Okay, maybe he could list some of the claims that turned out to be true, but that isn't nearly as entertaining as exposing Bill O'Reilly's facetious claim to two Peabody Awards; or Ann Coulter's illusion of friendship with him.<br />That's not to say that this is a book dedicated to amplifying the occasional misspeak or slip of the tongue.  As a personal friend of the late Paul Wellstone, Franken is incensed with the characterizations of a memorial service (for the senator, his family and friends that perished with him in a plane crash) that likened it to a crudely partisan political rally.  He adroitly compares the smattering of boos that some Republican senators received to the treatment of Hillary Clinton at a post-9/11 tribute at Madison Square Garden.  And his high dudgeon is as well founded as it is well defended.<br />What separates Franken from many other partisan pundits is that he is genuinely funny and not reluctant to poke fun at himself.  When a smart-alecky idea, to have fun with the campus recruiters for Bob Jones University falls a little flat, he relates the entire adventure with self-deprecating humor.  He also owns up to second thoughts regarding his participation in an early pro-war with Iraq rally.<br />It's Franken's wit that ultimately holds sway.  With terms like \\"traitor\\" and \\"slander\\" often being hurled from the Right, the Great Political Debate is decidedly less high brow than most of us would like; but at least Al has fun with it.  Even the iconic Barbara Bush comes under fire after a chance encounter on an airline flight.<br />If your taste in opinion shapers runs more along the lines of Coulter, O'Reilly and Limbaugh, you might be better advised to just sit by your radio.

Blackwood Farm is not without it's flaws however, as she seems stuck in a narrative theme that basically involves a vampire relating a personal and familial history that culminates with his acquisition of dark immortality.<br />The narrator of this tale is Quinn Blackwood, scion of a wealthy Louisiana family with a gothic past of its own, as well as some tenuous ties to the Mayfair family of New Orleans.  Quinn has lived his entire life (mortal and otherwise) with the companionship of a twin-like spirit he calls Goblin.  During his eccentric childhood, Quinn welcomed the love and friendship of his doppelganger, however as the years pass and he matures into a (much) more worldly young adult, Goblin evolves into a more jealous and malevolent presence.  Quinn's transformation into a vampire only increases the evil of Goblin, sending Quinn on a desperate search for help from the famed Lestat.<br />There are enough twists and surprises to satisfy most fans of the Chronicles, certainly more than some of the more recent tales.  But what makes this book more enjoyable is Ms. Rice's vivid and eclectic group of personalities.  Characterizations have always been one of her strong suits and Blackwood Farm reinforces that reputation.  Quinn Blackwood along with his ancestral and extended family are fascinating in their own right; and his interaction with various vampires, the Talamasca and the Mayfairs makes for a most enjoyable read.  It's particularly enjoyable to reencounter the precocious designee of the Mayfair Legacy, Mona, both for the post-Taltos update as well as her Lolita-ish vitality and potential for scandal.  Lastly, it's good to see Lestat growing away from his role as a self promoting rogue into a more complex and influential immortal, a vampire whose accomplishments are beginning to reflect a maturity worthy of his abilities and power.<br />Just when I was beginning to tire of Ms. Rice's vampires, she pulls me back in.  I am once again looking forward to her next effort.shments are beginning to reflect a maturity worthy of his abilities and power.<br />Just when I was beginning to tire of Ms. Rice's vampires, she pulls me back in.

This engrossing and enjoyable read is one of the most thought provoking books to ever deal with mountaineering.  Most books that have related the exploits and perils of mountain climbers have been first person accounts that balance observation with self-analysis, or journalistic efforts that seek to glorify or demonize the intensely individualistic adventurers that comprise the community of climbers.  The views and impressions of those closest to the climbers, their spouses, lovers and children, have largely been ignored or suppressed... until now.<br />Within a two page introduction, Maria Coffey firmly establishes her credentials to create this work.  Hers' is a perspective that is simultaneously critical, yet admiring of the people that pursue adventure through mountain climbing.  One of those climbers was Joe Tasker, her partner of two and a half years, who disappeared from the Northeast Ridge of Mount Everest more than twenty years ago.  In the time since, Ms. Coffey has dealt with the abrupt end to his life and their relationship through an examination of the motivations that drive men and women to risk their lives in an exercise where success is achieved not by just reaching the top of a mountain, but safely returning to the bottom.<br />Mountaineering is a unique endeavor, one without the usual trophies or audible applause of most other sports.  It's a sport in which records are established not by a higher score or faster time but by the realization of firsts - the first to summit, the first woman, first blind climber to summit, first one to pioneer a new route and so forth.  It's an activity that draws highly motivated people capable of surviving alone in the most harsh and solitary places on Earth.  Despite this solitary, sometimes selfish pursuit, others are left behind to deal with the consequences of a climber's mistakes or bad luck.<br />Ms. Coffey relates the stories of the wives, lovers and children with the type of empathy that can only be experienced by one who has shared experience.  A combination of admiration and exasperation with their risk-taking loved ones is a common thread throughout this book.  There is the expected pain of separation as their loved one is away for three or more months on yet another expedition, but they also must deal with the frustration of trying to maintain a \\"normal\\" home with while faced with the specter of a spouse or parent in near-constant peril.  Some strive to build a life of their own, separate and distinct from that of their climber.  Others network with the partners of other climbers, sharing news, monitoring the progress of each expedition from base camp or home.<br />As Ms. Coffey illustrates, the price of failure for these adventurers is thrust on their surviving loved ones as well.  Many are left with the doubt and denial left by a report that someone has \\"disappeared\\", never knowing precisely how or why the climber died.  They might cling to a dwindling thread of hope that somehow he has survived, only to learn five, ten or more years later that a mummified body has been found near a summit.  Often, the fate of their climber is all too clearly known as a when teammates witness their entombment under an avalanche of snow, rock and ice.  This burden of witness often torments the surviving climbers, as they are left to question the deaths of  close friends when they themselves were spared.<br />Every account, every personal story is different, from the individual epics related by the survivors of incidents on Everest, Annapurna, The Eiger, K2 and other legendary mountains, to children's' memories of a parent removed from their life long before they were capable of understanding.  Each resounds in a differing way.  A climbing team survives by the chance discovery of a bag of supplies left behind more than a year ago in tribute to teammates lost on a vertical wall.  A daughter builds a collection of teddy bears by giving her father a different one to carry on each climb, with one providing a psychological rescue for him during a near-death crisis.  A son bonds with his dad through climbing; then is arbitrarily removed by his father from the summit team just days before the final push.  The reason for his demotion goes unresolved for nearly twenty years.  There are also the countless bargains struck at moments of peril; where a climber vows to himself or others to abandon climbing should they survive, only to be drawn back to the mountains again and again.<br />Throughout the book, Maria Coffey weaves her own memories and emotions into the narrative, laying bare the good and the bad of her relationship with Joe Tasker.  While the question so often asked of the mountaineers is \\"why do you do it?\\"  The one posed to their families might be more along the lines of \\"how can you stand them?\\"  Ms. Coffey provides some potential answers, each of them as profound and personal as the next.mb, with one providing a psychological rescue for him during a near-death crisis.

Dan Brown has written an immensely enjoyable thriller that will grab your attention on the opening pages.  Blending vivid characters with fact, fiction, history, speculation and myth, The Da Vinci Code takes the reader on a fast paced search for the identity of a murderer.  The victim is the renowned curator of the Louvre, a man of diverse interests who uses clues originally planted by Leonardo Da Vinci and others, to protect and preserve an ancient secret.<br />Rousted from his hotel bed by the French Police; Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor and symbologist is brought to the galleries of the Louvre to witness and interpret the scene of the crime.  Clearly the victim intended to communicate a message, however the meaning of it is as mysterious as the motive behind his murder.  Aided by the granddaughter of the victim, a trained cryptologist, Langdon is thrust into a frenzied search for a killer; a search that might also lead to the answer of Christendom's most revered mystery, the Holy Grail itself!<br />Nothing is ever quite what it seems, as each puzzle unfolds to reveal yet another question to answer.  Doubt regarding allies and enemies persists as agents from French and British law enforcement, religious historians, the Vatican and Opus Dei jockey with the protagonists for the possession of a secret maintained by the mysterious Priory of Sion for almost two millennia.<br />What sets this novel apart from the usual murder/pursuit genre is Mr. Brown's ability to merge details from art history, symbology, mathematics,  forensics and theology into such a readable story.  Descriptions like \\"page-turner\\" and \\"couldn't put it down\\" are more than appropriate for The Da Vinci Code.  You'll find yourself racing the characters to interpret the various clues and puzzles, while breathlessly awaiting each turn of the plot.  Upon reaching the end, the only question that might remain is \\"exactly how much is true... and how much is fiction?\\"	2003-09-03

If you've never read anything by Ann Rice, this is the one to select first.  Years after it's release, many of Ms. Rice's fans still claim The Mummy as one of their favorites.  And justifiably so, as this work combines an inventive plot, vivid characterizations, subtle eroticism and exquisite Victorian settings in a fascinating novel that rewards the reader from start to finish.<br /><br />Forget every other mummy you may have read about or seen in movies.  The Ramses of this book is elegant, handsome and capable of charming all that he meets.  Blessed and cursed with eternal life, he has withdrawn into an ancient tomb only to be released by an archaeological expedition -- that plot device might well be the only cliche used by Ms. Rice throughout the book.  With his senses aroused and intrigued by the British civilization during the reign of Queen Victoria, he embarks upon a quest to rediscover his ancient love, Cleopatra, while captivating Julie, the daughter of the archeologist.<br />The story ends with a promise of continuing adventures for Ramses, Julie and the other characters, however no sequel has been published as yet.  At a book signing for her another of her books, I asked Ms. Rice when we could expect more from this fascinating collection of characters.  With a smile, she merely confided that &quot;I'm working on it now&quot;, however that was in 1995 and we still wait.<br /><br />If you have been reluctant to read an Ann Rice novel, this particular story will provide a good introduction to her style of writing without subjecting you to the complexities and darker themes of her Vampires or the Mayfair witches.  The downside to that is that after reading The Mummy, you may very well want more and find yourself embarked on a figurative Ann Rice literary festival as you read more and more of this wonderful writer's work.	2003-08-04

Harry's back, another year older but saddled with the typical teenager's conceit of believing that he is a decade wiser.  He can be excused some of that, after all during his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft, Harry managed to win the Tri-Wizards Cup competition along with defeating the Dark Lord Voldemort in a face to face duel.  But achievements like that will only carry you so far in the wizard world.<br />A new year at Hogwarts is about to begin and Harry is miserable.  He's been subjected to another two months of tyranny from the Dursleys; the Daily Prophet seems to be waging a campaign to discredit him as a delusional seeker of publicity; and there is the specter of his Ordinary Wizarding Levels (O.W.L.s) hanging over this next term.  Of course, in order to even sit for the O.W.L.s he must return to Hogwarts, and that is not necessarily a foregone conclusion.<br />The wait for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix may have been longer than many of J.K. Rowling's fans were willing to bear, but it was clearly worth it!  Unlike many literary serials, each of the Potter books has grown more vivid and compelling than it's predecessors.  That's good news and not so good news as this version checks in at a staggering 870 pages in length.  But it's 870 of very, very readable adventure and personality.  Personality?  Perhaps a better word would be \\"attitude\\".  And Harry like any 15 year old male (wizard or muggle) has attitude to spare.  It tests his relationships with friends and mentors alike.  The story is rich, but dark and Harry must confront a personal loss of immense proportions along the way.  So much has been written about the death of a significant character that to offer more might be giving away too much.<br />The entire cast of characters delivers on a number of different fronts.  Graduation has opened the keeper slot on the Gryffindor Quidditch team for Ron, and he's also a new prefect along with Hermione who is still as insufferably bright and studious as ever.  To Harry's dismay, Dumbledore is keeping his distance, distracted by matters of greater import, and Hagrid is tending to more secrets in the Dark Forest.  Then there is Professor Snape, who's life's work seems to be centered around browbeating Harry into expulsion, only this year the new Defense against the Dark Arts instructor may accomplish that task for him!  And did I mention that there are boy/girl issues to address?  You only need to think back to age 15 to conjure your own disturbing emotions in that regard.<br />What sets Ms. Rowling's talent apart from other authors is not just her ability to craft an intricate and fascinating plot, but the depth of characterization that colors her writing.  She manages to truly get inside the head of a 15 year old male in a way that is uncanny and more than entertaining.  This latest installment will answer a number of questions for the reader, perhaps the most important being \\"why does Harry have to return to the Dursley's each year?\\", but there are sufficient new mysteries to unearth and carry the reader into the remainder of the series.  It's a marvelous read for all!ferably bright and studious as ever.

You only need to think back to age 15 to conjure your own disturbing emotions in that regard.<br />What sets Ms. Rowling's talent apart from other authors is not just her ability to craft an intricate and fascinating plot, but the depth of characterization that colors her writing.  She manages to truly get inside the head of a 15 year old male in a way that is uncanny and more than entertaining.  This latest installment will answer a number of questions for the reader, perhaps the most important being \\"why does Harry have to return to the Dursley's each year?\\", but there are sufficient new mysteries to unearth and carry the reader into the remainder of the series.  It's a marvelous read for all!	2003-06-30

Bruce Feiler attempts to collect the varied and sometimes conflicting stories of the man many believe to be the first to enter into a covenant with God.<br />Universal agreement concerning Abraham does not come easily.  Most Jewish, Christian or Moslems would agree that he was the first to acknowledge the existence of a single God, that he entered into a covenant with God wherein he agreed to follow God's instructions to leave his homeland for an unknown destination.  Already old and childless, he and his wife Sarah were told by God that they would bear a son, and that their descendants would create a great nation.  Later, God instructed Abraham to offer his son, \\"the son whom you love\\" as sacrifice to the One God.  Beyond those gross generalizations, the story of Abraham morphs in various directions depending upon the beliefs of the story teller.<br />The instruction to take \\"the son whom you love\\" serves as a critical focus of debate for many, as Christians and Jews believe that Abraham offered his son Isaac by his wife, Sarah as the sacrifice; whereas Moslems believe that it was his older son Ishmael (born to his slave Hagar) that was placed on the sacrificial altar.  Feiler discusses how the various religions interpret similar writings or incidents, and yet arrive at dramatically different conclusions.<br />What elevates this book beyond the realm of a comparative religion text book, is Feiler's balanced portrait of a man who exists in a singular position of relevance to Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  Fundamentalists of any persuasion will likely take issue with some of his observations, but Feiler treats his subject with respect and awe, and a desire to place Abraham into a position that might bridge some of the passions that exist today in the Middle East.  He succeeds in that regard, with interviews and discussions with Abrahamic scholars and clerics that give a glimmer of hope for all of us.that exist today in the Middle East.

Perhaps timing is everything, but don't tell that to Jon Krakauer, an outdoors writer and mountain climber who was offered the opportunity of a lifetime to climb Mount Everest; only to find himself in the middle of the most notable catastrophe to ever strike the mountain.  With the 50th anniversary of the successful assent by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, there is renewed interest in Chomolungma (the Tibetan name for the mountain.  Previous to the second half of the twentieth century, Everest was a forbidden monolith that crushed anyone who attempted to scale it's heights.  But with it's invincibility shattered by Hillary and Norgay, Everest began to shed some of it's mystery, and bit by bit, the appearance (but just the appearance) of it's lethality.  By the 90's, the primary requisite for a summit attempt was a bank account large enough to pay for an experienced guide.  New problems like the litter of discarded oxygen canisters became a threat to the mountain, as the climbing ranks swelled with serious amateurs anxious to achieve various ego firsts like \\"first woman over 60,\\" \\"first Lithuanian\\" to summit Everest, along with the highest mountains on each of the continents.<br />Outside magazine sent Krakauer on an expedition with Rob Hall, one of the most experienced of the new crop of guides, whose business it was to get climbers to the summit.  Even with modern equipment and climbing techniques that's still a daunting task, not for the faint of heart or the expanded of waistline.  However the professional mountaineers of Hillary's generation were being followed on Hall's expedition by a postal employee, a New York socialite and others.  They were joined on the mountain by various teams, some so inexperienced as to be comical.  Among the other teams was one led by Scott Fisher, another guide that was making a name for his ability to get people to the top and in a bit of braggadocio had even claimed that he had \\"found a golden staircase to the summit.\\"<br />Krakauer outlines all of the minutia regarding preparation and execution of an Everest climb.  You can almost find yourself wheezing as he describes what existence is like above the elevation that is known as the Death Zone.  And he recounts in harrowing detail the storm that hit while Hall and Fisher's teams were near or below the summit, and the efforts of the others to rescue them.  I had mixed feelings when I read of the final conversation between Rob Hall, as he sat helpless and dying on the mountain, and his pregnant wife back in New Zealand.  Here is a man and woman exchanging their final words, both fully aware of his fate, and yet we mortals who will likely never be tested in this way are privy to his private thoughts and her quiet despair.<br />Moving from the role of dispassionate observer, into a deeper role of survivor, Krakauer anguishes over what he could have done differently, of the mistakes he believes he made and how he will ever reconcile his grief.  Yes, he stood on the summit.  Yes, he survived and returned home.  But he has no satisfaction about conquering the mountain.  And he questions why anyone else would even attempt it./>Krakauer outlines all of the minutia regarding preparation and execution of an Everest climb.

I don't know which is more fascinating, the story of the steamship Central America sinking amid a violent storm; or the story of the engineer extraordinaire who resolved to recover it's California gold rush cargo that had remained undisturbed for almost 125 years under two miles of ocean.  Fortunately, Gary Kinder chose to tell both tales and they are equally engrossing<br />Almost by definition, disasters at sea make for interesting reading, and the foundering of the Central America ranks among the worst maritime losses in American history.  She went down in water over 10,000 feet deep, lost for over a century.  Kinder relates her final voyage, illuminating the heroism of her captain, crew and passengers in a style that nearly makes the reader weep as her decks vanish into the sea.  That alone would make this book worthy of note in any list of ship histories, but Tommy Thompson determined to find the wreck and to recover a treasure that many experts considered to be unrecoverable.<br />It takes a talented writer to make an engineer seem interesting, or maybe the engineer just has to combine an almost Edison-like gift for innovation with a bit of treasure hunter to be interesting.  First you have to find the ship, then you have to figure out how to bring it's cargo back to the surface - no mean feat at those depths.  But Thompson wasn't content with simply finding and recovering the gold bullion and coins that went down with the Central America, he wanted to bring the artifacts up as cleanly and completely as possible.  Where others might have been content to just sink a robot-controlled bucket down to the wreck and scoop up what ever could be found, Thompson and his crew invented new technologies that brought coins up with so little damage that appraisers at first questioned whether they were from a shipwreck.  Thompson and company face one challenge after another, engineering problems, technologic problems, financial problems and even the drama provided by rival treasure hunters.

This is the story, told in the first person, of a girl from Kentucky whose life becomes inextricably linked with New England whaling and the legendary captain of the Pequod.  Herman Mehlville briefly mentioned the existence of a partner for Ahab in his illustrious tome; Ms. Naslund takes that reference and imagines an entire life intertwined with people and events both real and literary.<br />Naslund's heroine, Una is a strong character worthy of her fictional husband Ahab.  Hers is a life that is rich and multi-textured as any you'll ever encounter.  In fact, Ahab enters Una's life relatively late in the novel, long after she has been through her own whaling adventures, which include a ship that meets its demise via whale attack.  This might not become the timeless classic of it's literary relation, but it's worthy of the association.  It's an incredibly skillful piece of literary craftsmanship!	2003-06-05

This book is almost too witty for it's own good, but it's a thoroughly enjoyable read!  The first few pages led me to suspect that Nanny, the heroine of this modern morality play, might be just a little too sensitive and a little self-absorbed to be taken seriously.  But as it picks up speed, Nan wins you over with her grace under pressure, her devotion to her young charge and the rebellious spirit that allows her to simply survive employment for a family that has too much money, too many individualistic priorities and absolutely no consideration whatsoever.<br />Nanny is a college student that is recruited by Mrs. X to be a part-time caregiver to young Grayer.  Normally the use of \\"X\\" as a pseudonym would turn me off, but here it's a justifiable defense tactic in that the authors, Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus have worked as nannies; and both prefer to prevent any possible linkage to their former employers.  In fact, they preface the book with a more explicit disclaimer of possible real events or characters than is usually found in novels.  That's a good thing, because if Mr. and Mrs. X truly walk (or limo) through the streets of New York, civilization as we know it is doomed!<br />Grayer is not unlike most four year old kids that I've met.  He can be utterly charming in one moment and a tyrannical hellion the next.  And as you move through the story, he will win your heart and sympathy just as completely as he does Nanny's.  Consider the fact that his most precious possession is one of his father's well worn business cards.  He can't go anywhere without it!<br />His parents are another story altogether.  Mrs. X is a woman who has worked her way up from mistress to second wife, and is now in danger of becoming an ex-Mrs. X.  Somewhere along the way, she managed to confuse the definition of part-time caregiver with that of indentured servant, but no matter.  She has other things to be concerned with, things like organizing Mr. X's parties, shopping for herself and maintaining her current social and marital status.  Note the absence of \\"spending time with Grayer\\" in that list of concerns.  Mr. X is simply too busy with his business and the potential next Mrs. X to be more than a shadowy presence, whose son might not recognize him without his omnipresent cell phone adorned ear.<br />The story moves from autumn to summer with Nanny's job description being augmented with duties ranging from minor errand running, to attending a society Halloween party in full Teletubbie regalia, Christmas shopping for the X's other employees, to accompanying the family on vacation.  If Nanny hasn't won your heart by the Halloween party, her informed speculation regarding her own Christmas gift (fueled by the knowledge of what the other \\"help\\" is receiving) and the ultimate reality of it will.  There are also play dates that succeed and play dates that leave you wondering like the baking session featuring a manic, barely dressed mother on a coke-fueled high.<br />Throughout the book, Nan gives the reader the benefit of her own intelligent observations as well as the comebacks and questions that she would \\"really\\" like to offer to the X's.  It makes for a great story that will win you over completely!

Will Bartlett, the director of a small resident company of actors in the 1970's, senses that their work has become a bit complacent, making their company vulnerable to closing in favor of more popular (and \\"safe\\") touring productions.  His solution is to bring the entire cast to his rural summer home, so that they might \\"live\\" the production of Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\", thus uncovering new depth to their roles that will energize the audience and the company's benefactors.  Unfortunately, he has failed to notice the complacency and stagnation within his own family.  The result of this exercise in creativity is a mixture of chaos and pathos as various members of Will's theatrical and home families jockey and learn more about themselves, their friends and rivals.<br />Will's wife Myra and daughter Beth discover a mutual yearning for the role of Curley's Wife, that threatens to send their already robust mother/daughter rivalry over the edge.  Meanwhile, Melinda the flower child actress embraces the role along with a castmate.  Meanwhile, the motley collection of actors discover that living the lives of farm workers is much more difficult than recreating them on stage.<br />The near-communal living conditions stretch hormones as well, as Beth plots her seduction of the hunky young heartthrob, Myra looks to re-energize her life with Will's best friend, and a closeted gay man discovers a potential soul mate.  Throughout the week, Will the director focuses so tightly on his concept of the play that he is completely blind to the shifting relationships offstage.  The events of man and nature bring the ensemble to a collection of resolutions that range from poignant to worrisome.<br />With a third person literary style that constantly shifts from character to character, Ms. Willis has created a nice novel that somehow left me wanting more.  The players are all vividly portrayed, however I can't help but wish that events could have moved just a little faster than a snail's pace.pace.	2003-05-27

It's not that Ms. Rice has lost any of her writing ability, indeed her descriptions of locales ranging from New Orleans to Central American jungles can almost make you sweat while enduring a New England winter; but finding a compelling plot line is becoming more and more of a problem.<br />Merrick is a witch of substantial power, descended from a branch of the Mayfair family.  Beset by multiple demons of the spirit world (ghosts and demons) and the temptations of spirits (alcohol), she has lived within the Order of the Talamasa since adolescence.  Now her semi-incestuous mentor, David Talbot, seeks her help on behalf of Louis, the original protagonist of &quot;Interview with a Vampire&quot;.  After a great deal of reminiscing and tale-telling by David (who serves as narrator), we are brought to the type of resolution that dominates so many of Ms. Rice's novels of the past ten years or so.<br />Perhaps you should read this with the expectation of digesting a series of richly described short stories.  Individual chapters can almost stand alone, yet the thread that passes for a story line is stretched entirely too far.  Ms. Rice has done much better in the past.	2003-05-07

Michael Moore will never have to worry about being too subtle, nor should he bother applying for a job as a diplomat or arbitrator.  But therein lies the appeal of his work.  In a society that allegedly decries political correctness, Moore airs his views with a blunt force that can make almost anyone squirm.  And while the Dixie Chicks might see fit to apologize or clarify a single off the cuff remark, Michael is unrepentant regarding the positions taken in his films, writings or commentaries.<br />His true talent lies in his ability to be entertaining while lambasting what he sees as the inequities and injustices of American life today.  Michael is a proud LIBERAL, who saves some of his ire for alleged leftists whose achievements he judges to be more conservative than liberal.  By way of example, some of his best shots are aimed squarely at Bill Clinton, accusing him of being the president that did more to advance the Republican agenda than any of his predecessors.<br />You might not agree with every conclusion that he reaches - I don't - but you have to admire the fact that he can produce a chain of evidence to support his opinions.  Granted that the chain might be a little crooked or that a link or two might be a bit tenuous, but Moore goes to more trouble to research and defend his ideas than various high profile commentators of the Right (like Ann Coulter or William Bennett).  Even his critics provide fodder when he notes that his first film generate ton's of negative mail for showing the killing of a rabbit (for food), but nary a complaint about the scene in which a black man is shot by police - on camera.<br />If you're unsure about whether to read this book, consider Michael's appearance at the Academy Awards.  It's vintage Michael Moore.  If you agree with him, buy the book.  If you don't agree with what he said but were entertained, buy the book.  If his words disturbed you, you might want to just borrow it to browse through.

He's been a comedian, cartoon voice artist, ad man, playwrite, satirist, writer and ethicist.  He has created ad campaigns that lampooned the very industries they promoted.  And he's stood up to the Darth Vader's of business, refusing to treat the consumer like an idiot.<br />The most refreshing aspect of this book is the fact that so much of his humor survives the test of time.  One of the photos he uses is from a commercial for Chun King Chow Mein, where the voice-over proclaimed that \\"nine out of ten doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein.\\"  I remember the ad, but I still found myself laughing out loud as I realized that the picture of ten men in medical garb was comprised of nine Asians and one Caucasian.<br />Unfortunately, there is the realization that anti-Frebergian forces still hold influence over our media, even after so many years of Stan leading the charge for truth and honesty.  He doesn't need to make things up, the words of his antagonists are more absurd than any of his thousands of characters.<br />As other reviewers have noted, this volume ends in 1963, with much of his best work yet to come.

Contrary to modern warfare, where the commander might be tens or hundreds of miles removed from the battlefield, the leaders of the Union and Confederate troops were never far from the very thick of the fight and often in harm's way.  The timidity of a George McClellan compared with the ferocity of a Stonewall Jackson was transferred to their troops, with strategic decisions being reinforced by the personalities of the officers involved.  Jeff Shaara understands that and communicates it brilliantly in Gods and Generals.<br />Modern war stories tend to be best told from the view of the individual soldier, the person that is continually confronted with the blood, the noise and the horror.  But Shaara uses the generals and their staffs to give nuance and illumination to a conflict that was much more complex in it's origins than the common perception of it being a war abolition versus slavery.  He takes the reader into the strategy counsels of the various combatants, where the stoicism of Robert E. Lee stands in marked contrast to the flamboyance of his cavalry commander, J.E.B. Stuart.  While across the lines, field generals like Winfield Hancock strive to support their troops while following ill-considered tactical decisions of Generals McClellan, Burnside and Hooker.<br />This is a prequel to the Killer Angels, the earlier masterpiece of Michael Shaara, Jeff's father, that so adroitly told the tale of the battle of Gettysburg. After Michael's death, Jeff was persuaded to expand his work with this novel that covers the years before the war, and the early battles in Virginia.  Prior to the 1860's, war was perceived by much of the public as contests of honor fought on far away battlegrounds, under arcane rules that belied the fact that blood was shed and men died.  Consider the gentry of Washington D.C. that took their carriages to picnic and watch the battle of Antietam; expecting to see a quick and orderly end of the rebellion, only to find themselves fleeing in panic before the ill-equipped but motivated troops of the Confederacy.  In a similar dichotomy, the reaction of the Confederate troops to the Union's shelling of the town of Fredricksburg seems disproportionate to that of losing comrades to enemy fire.<br />Jeff Shaara is every bit the story teller that his father was.

Up to the time that I became aware of this book, I thought that the Seabiscuit was &quot;just another racehorse with a name more suitable for punchlines by the Three Stooges.  After all, I never saw his name listed among any of the Triple Crown winners or even as a winner of a Triple Crown race.  That's a testament to my personal ignorance however.  I now know however, that as a cultural phenomenon, Seabiscuit compares favorably with Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan and Babe Ruth.<br />It's not that he won horse races, it's the way he won horse races.  It's the way he overcame challenges.  The individual stories of the people that comprised &quot;Team Biscuit&quot; could have easily drawn the attention of writers with lesser talents, but Laura Hillenbrand puts the spotlight squarely on this wonderful horse; skillfully weaving in the exploits of his owner, trainer and jockeys to illustrate how he won the hearts and minds of a depression-battered nation.<br />There is something for everyone here.  Have you ever wondered about how someone could train a racehorse?  How a human can exploit, while simultaneously protect the competitive heart of an animal?  How a horse can affect the lives of so many?  Seabiscuit is a book that is almost impossible to put down (yes, I know that's a clich&eacute;) but you won't believe how much sleep I happily lost because of this book.

Clearly, Bill Quinn and many other people have an axe to grind with the Bentonville retailing giant. Augmenting his own experience and observations with the testimony of others (some anonymous and some not), Quinn succeeds in knocking the corporate behemoth down by a peg or two.<br />By now, most people are aware of the effect that Wal-Mart has had on small town America, but you may not be aware of some of the tactics they have used in their quest for dominance. It's never been a secret that Wal-Mart can be a particularly aggressive competitor, but the degree of organized hypocrisy that appears to drive these people makes one long for the days of the equally ruthless but less folksy robber barons of yore -- the capitalistic aristocracy of Rockefeller, Gould, Vanderbilt and Carnegie.<br />It all makes for a fascinating book, one that I would have rated much higher were it not for the slightly adolescent sarcasm that runs throughout.  I might also quibble a bit with the organization of Quinn's material, but I'll give him bonus points for guts, perspective and a preponderance of evidence.	2003-01-24

As many reviewers have noted, Mr. Brock confesses to lies and fabrications throughout this book so his veracity might be put to question.  But I'm tempted to believe this political confessional if for no other reason than his portrayal of many conservative pundits seems rational enough to understand many of their rantings.  It's not the political theology that many of his former colleagues embrace that's dangerous.  It's the motivations and personal agendas that drive many of them to utter rumor as fact while maintaining a holier-than-thou level of hypocracy that seems unprecedented in modern times.<br />The Rush Limbaughs, David Horowitzs, Ann Coulters and Matt Drudges of the world can bray and shout, however Brock pulls aside the curtain to give rational people a peek at what they are really after.  It's a shame that Mr. Brock can't fully dissect the motivations that create a level of disgust and hate far beyond that of polite dissent, but then I doubt that anyone truly understands them.

Langewiesche bends over backwards to be fair and impartial, and he details a fascinating, compelling story of how a disparate group of civil service bureaucrats, police officials, fire fighters, engineers and construction civilians came together to solve a set of inconceivable problems.  He doesn't create any new heroes, and he may have even brought some of the more alleged heroes of 9/11 down a peg or two, but he never trashes anyone.  He lays out the facts as facts and links his own opinions with personal observations.  That's more important to me than any patriotic mythology.	2002-10-30
