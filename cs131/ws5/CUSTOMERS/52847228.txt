Without a clear mind  you will be lost... it takes common sense, good logic and quiet  surroundings to successfully read the book in its entirety.<br />Second, the  topics covered are well laid out... from relativity, to quantum mechanics,  to the cosmos, to string theory... and even a chapter discussing our  existence and how God fits in the picture. All in all, every chapter builds  on the next very well, and the visual/&quot;plain English&quot;  descriptions blend well with the scientific terminology.<br />Third, the  chapter on string theory (which was recently added) left me feeling a  little hungry for more... although it describes what string theory is, I  felt a lacking of completeness... probably due to the fact that this is a  newer field in theoretical physics.<br />If you are interested in theoretical  physics at all, and wish to understand Einstein's theories of relativity  and how the fit with quantum mechanics, then this is the book to start  with. After having read this book you will feel the urge to get some other  books discussing quantum mechanics, space-time warpings, string theory,  wormholes, and black holes.<br />Believe me... theoretical physics is a very  interesting subject that has been developed over many years by brilliant  minds... those who are able to open their minds to what the cosmos and the  universe have to show can certainly achieve understanding... and perhaps  question things further.<br />Enjoy!	2000-07-16
