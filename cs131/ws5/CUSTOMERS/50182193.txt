Tolkien: A Biography	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Tolkien, read by millions, and here he is	J.R.R. \\"Tollers\\" Tolkien was born in South Africa; as this biography shows, he was moved back to the home of his English parents as a very young child and was not influenced by his native land at all.  Carpenter's biography is very strong on the harsh circumstances of young Tolkien's upbringing, particularly the death of his young parents before World War I.   <br /> <br />The orphaned Tolkien found solace in the Catholic Church, of which he would be a faithful member for the rest of his life.  Carpenter correctly places great emphasis on Tolkien's Catholicism, which is not at all obvious to those who are most familiar with Tolkien by reading his fictional works.  Tolkien also found love, and discovered within himself a surpassing love of comparative linguistics.  Tolkien's skill with the languages of northern Europe made him more than just a linguist.  He became a philologist, a member of a rare subset of linguists who were able to reconstruct the meanings of lost and forgotten words. <br /> <br />Carpenter points out that, for Tolkien, the act of writing fiction was a labor that blended into his philological genius. Eventually Tolkien was able to convince himself that he was, not creating a fantasy world, but rediscovering a world that had always been there, waiting to be re-found and re-written.   <br /> <br />This was a fateful act of perception, because one of the grave dangers of fantasy-writing is that the writer will get lost in his or her own ego.  Tolkien was able to set himself aside and go exploring, to the delight of readers all over the world.   <br /> <br />Underneath much else were Tolkien's hellish experiences in World War I.  Already himself an orphan, the young man had to endure the deaths of two of his closest friends in battle.  When he would write about the sufferings of fantasy characters in war, real blood and real death lay behind the printed pages. <br /> <br />This is a biography of a man who, superficially, was one of the least egotistical of writers.  Carpenter shows the strong feelings and slightly embittered personality behind the facade.  Havaing interviewed many members of Tolkien's own friends and family, he has produced a classic work of appreciation.	2005-04-12

Apsley Cherry-Garrard went \\"South with Scott\\" in 1912.  Unlike his expedition leader, Cherry-Garrard came home to England - minus most of his teeth, but alive.  One of England's richest young men, he seemed to have every prospect of succeeding in whatever new challenges life would throw at him.  And yet, for Cherry-Garrard, his years with Scott's Last Expedition would prove to be the most intense and all-consuming experience of his life, and in a very real sense he would spend the rest of his days re-living his days in the Antarctic.<br /><br />Cherry-Garrard wrote and rewrote his memories to produce this classic book.  It interleaves pages from his diary, quotes and letters from many of Cherry-Garrard's surviving expedition comrades, memories, and reminiscences - some of them startingly piercing and balanced.  The reputation of Robert Scott and his fellow explorers has come under sharp scrutiny in recent decades, with many criticisms pointed at the explorer's weaknesses.  In many cases these criticisms are based upon Cherry-Garrard's own sharp insights and balanced judgment.<br /><br />In the end, however, Cherry-Garrard was loyal to his dead commander and deceased comrades.  The men who died on their way back from the South Pole, Robert Scott, Dr. Edward Wilson, \\"Birdie\\" Bowers, \\"Titus\\" Oates, and Edgar Evans, had been among Cherry-Garrard's closest friends in life.  Cherry-Garrard is honest enough to point out the mistakes they all made, but his concluding judgment is that these men wrote a page of heroic endeavor that is unlikely to ever be surpassed.  Read about it here.	2005-03-02

This reviewer has, I believe, achieved an understanding of the heart of what Lewis was trying to gain here: the ability to insert, into the minds of his readers, a contingent understanding of the frames within which the Middle Ages reading public saw their world.   <br /> <br />What Lewis is describing was not metaphysics.  It was real physics, the way real people looked at a real world.  \\"It was not true,\\" Lewis admits, but he goes on to make two further claims that cannot, I think, be disproved: <br /> <br />1. The medieval model of the universe was filled with \\"delight.\\"  It was beautiful in a way that inspired poets and artists of all sorts to creativity.  Lewis points out that the mentality of a creative artist of the Middle Ages, inspired by the Discarded Image as a model of the universe, was much less egotistical than many creative people are expected to be today.  Artists routinely produced masterpieces and then did not sign them.  Simply working on a corner of the Model was enough. <br /> <br />2.  The medieval model of the universe was not true and has since been disproved by modern physics, but we can have no assurance that the models we follow and believe in today are true, either.  In fact, to philosophers of human thinking like Kuhn and Lewis, every \\"model\\" that we come to believe in from time to time is contingent; all of them either have been, or some day will be, superseded by new models. <br /> <br />Lewis was a Christian, and he felt an Appreciative-love for the European Middle Ages that he wanted his readers to share.  I hope the readers of this review will believe me when I say that Lewis did not over-play his own religion in this book.  He fearlessly makes it clear that, if the Middle Ages and their aesthetic model of the universe had aspects of beauty in them, these aspects were as likely to be due to elements of pagan survivalas they were to Christianity.  We are repeatedly reminded that the European Middle Ages were not a high-tech, totalitarian theocracy, but a very poor world in which a wide variety of Christian and pre-Christian cultural forces jostled with each other.	2005-01-26

Marie regions, many originally collected by folklorist Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, into a volume of nineteen stories suitable for older children and young teenage readers.  The myths are told in a way that is suitable for families of almost all beliefs.  The overall tone of these retellings is gentle, and it lacks some of the grimness that marked these stories as they were originally told.  One key theme of these retellings, repeated over and over, is that of the metamorphosis or transformation of the souls of key human characters into a new dimension or state of being.	2004-06-08

Tolkien Created a New Mythology)	Books	5	28	28	N	N	Don't let the word &quot;philology&quot; deter you	This book is quite simply superb in every conceiveable respect.  It is written by a scholar who understands and respects Tolkien's own scholarly passion for philology, the science and stories of the evolution of words and language.  This is very different from the humanistic field of literary criticism, and Shippey explains at some length what a philologist can and cannot do.  The close reader will end Shippey's book with a wistful feeling that some very wrong turns have been made in academia over the past one hundred years, and one of the reasons for Tolkien's greatness in his time was quite simply his refusal to accept or acknowledge that these wrong turns had been made.  At bottom, a scholar of literature is, or at least ought to be, someone who loves words.  We will always have a few of these people among us, and Tolkien's and Shippey's works remind us that no overgrown pathway is ever truly lost.	2004-05-29

Keep in mind that after 1862, the C.S.A. had very little good-quality paper or ink.  A typical Rebel missive was written with homemade vegetable ink on the margins of a used business letter.  It was under these discouraging circumstances that the men who wore the gray told their families, wives, and loves ones of the reality of Civil War (War Between the States) combat.  <br />&quot;The Life of Johnny Reb&quot; is drawn from these thousands of letters, as well as contemporary newspaper articles, court-martial records, medical accounts, and regimental histories.  Wiley was in all phases of his research a severe realist who was not interested in romanticising his subjects.  When he admires the common soldier of the Confederacy, it is admiration that is due on the basis of the facts and nothing but the facts.  <br />Wiley, himself a Southerner, uses some of the euphemisms required of writers of his day.  Slaves are routinely called &quot;servants&quot;, for example, and if one of his men writes a few lines of obscene poetry, Wiley will sometimes refuse to quote them in print.    <br />Many of us believe that the C.S.A. was not a worthy cause for which to fight.  All the more honor, then, to those common soldiers of the Confederacy who fought, bled, and died for it in increasing awareness of the fact that they were likely to lose.  Whatever the ultimate justice of their cause, they did their best.	2003-09-02

Morrell, a Bethlehem Steel ore boat, in Lake Huron in 1966 is another awesome tale of the power of the \\"freshwater seas.\\"  The huge vessel fell into the through of the seas on its ill-fated November voyage and cracked in two.  <br />The heart of the book are the edited oral reminescences of Dennis Hale, the sole survivor of the disaster.  Hale recalls the loneliness of his early life, the camaraderie he found among his fellow seamen, and the unexpected tragedy of the boat's catastrophic failure and sinking.   <br />Hale and three fellow survivors crawled from the icy water into an unpowered lifeboat, exposed to the freezing elements of mid-November Lake Huron.  Due to the failure of the shipping line and the Coast Guard to mount an immediate search for the missing ore boat and its crew, Hale had to watch his comrades die in the lifeboat.   Hale does not know why he alone survived, and recalls an \\"out of the body\\" experience which he had, alone, on the lifeboat.  This testimony only adds to the mystery.<br />Hale's account does not make up a full-sized book, and the editors were forced to fill it out with public-domain stuff from the sinking - specifically, the Coast Guard final report on the disaster.  <br />Although much of this book is made up of dull, bureaucratic addenda, Hale's own story is an essential element of any good Great Lakes collection.  Although this book has flaws, it is highly recommended.	2002-09-18

However, it is bent, on every paragraph of every page, against older siblings.  I know from my own personal experience that there is in fact a distinctive and characteristic older-sibling world view, but the author of this book appears to be so envious and so spiteful that he cannot see anything but the dark side of this distinctive pattern.  Thus, the definitive written work understanding and celebrating the diversity of different birth-order world views remains to be written.  <br />I should like to know what the author, Frank Sulloway, thinks of today's China.  The Chinese government has for at least two decades, especially in urban areas, encouraged families to be content with only one child.  As a result of the partial success of this policy, there are now an uncharacteristically large number of oldest-siblings now growing toward adulthood in China, unleavened by what would otherwise be a proportionate cohort of younger ones.  Does Mr. Sulloway view this with alarm?  Is he prepared to be consistent with his own theory, which requires those who believe in it to characterize this generation of young Chinese as hierarchically content, unimaginative stick-in-the-muds?  Surely nobody who values human diversity would go so far.  Sulloway's theories are fascinating and should be followed up by other serious students of human nature.  However these theories, when taken by themselves, lead to conclusions that very few real persons would accept.	2002-03-03

Hey, it worked for Horace Walpole, didn't it?  <br />The scene is painted as thickly as a Van Gogh painting.  The great castle broods under a dismal sky as Prince Manfred prepares for the wedding of his good-for-nothing son, Conrad, with Isabella, the daughter of a neighboring feudal lord.  Plans for the wedding are interrupted when a gigantic helmet interferes with the ceremony.  Manfred has good reason to become angry and alarmed . . . . but to find out why, you'll have to read the book.  <br />This book should be read for the atmosphere, which is dark and romantic from beginning to end.  In the final paragraph, two of the principal characters do get married and live happily ever after, but only so the hero can &quot;forever indulge the melancholy that had taken possession of his soul.&quot;  On this almost gruesome note the book ends.  <br />Read this book, the foundation-stone of gothic sensibility.  Let's face it, gothic scene-painting flirts with unreality and always has done so.  Here at the beginning, it all seems more real.	2001-12-20

He is right to note that rich, powerful governments are often corrupt, but the men and women who make up these governments do not change thir ways because someone preaches at them.  <br />As with other histories written in ancient times, the two stories contained in this book are partly historical data, partly historical narratives, and partly dramatic dialogue.  Whenever Sallust wants to make a general point, like &quot;Rome is the city where everything is for sale&quot;, he adapts the language of this assertion to the circumstances of a point of specific action, and then puts it into the mouth of one of his characters.  Keep in mind that the dramatic dialogue may be fiction, but the underlying points may very well have been valid.  Rome really was a city where almost everything was for sale, and reading narratives like these gives us a vivid look at this reality.  <br />This work is flawed, but we should be very happy that we have it because it gives us an alternate (pagan) look at power relationships within the late Roman Republic - a society that would soon become an Empire and produce written works (both Christian and secular) that are today read all over the world.	2001-11-12

It will be read for centuries to come, like Boswell's life of Samuel Johnson, as an example of what the English language can be at its best.  A biographer of Churchill faces a terrific challenge.  He or she has to be able to write, if not as well, at least almost as well as Churchill himself.  After a lifetime of journalism and historical writing, Manchester was able to finish this book, the dramatic story of how Churchill came together with the nation that had rejected him.  Together, these two forces, Churchill and the British nation - and Manchester correctly personalizes them both, sees them both as equal characters in a dramatic story - forged a partnership to fight Hitler and save the world from disaster.  <br />It would probably be a lot easier for all of us if we all knew what it is like to have courage.  I am writing this review at a time when we Americans, and the people of the world, are being called upon to have quite a lot of it.  Apparently, the universe is built in such a way that we human beings must try to be courageous whether we want to be so or not.  The true reason of history, and of historical books like this one, is to hold a mirror up to courage and the other human virtues, to show us what these virtues are like so that we must follow them if we are able to do so.  Like Thucydides said, happiness comes from being free, and freedom comes from being courageous.<br />It is too bad that this is where Manchester's great biography of Churchill must end, but he has brought the story to its climax.  The work of people like Manchester is an inspiration to other writers, and perhaps some other historian will appear some day to finish the work begun and broken off here.	2001-10-10

The authors are trained crime professionals and their guess is a plausible one. But it is just that - a guess. The trail is colder than the South Pole. There are many possible hypotheses as to what happened to the Lindbergh baby and this is only one of them. Ahlgren and Monier present a convincing case that Bruno Hauptmann, the man arrested, convicted, and executed for the kidnapping, was either innocent or, at worst, a subsidiary figure in a kidnapping ring. He was ruthlessly &quot;framed&quot; by the New York and New Jersey police, who concocted additional evidence to build a case against Hauptmann. However, Ahlgren and Monier never explain how a large percentage of the Lindbergh ransom money ended up in Hauptmann's possession. Furthermore, the case for Hauptmann has also been made by other books and documentaries. This book should be very interesting to people who have an interest in the Lindbergh kidnapping case. However, readers should not rely on it as their one and only book to tell them about the &quot;Crime of the Century.&quot;	2001-08-27

Petersen, longtime boss of the Mackinac Island State Park, this book was simultaneously a work of serious history and a labor of love.  He uncovered dozens of old photographs of Mackinac Island, especially its busy, tourist-oriented miniature &quot;city&quot; at the base of the cliff, and wrote captions that are simultaneously light, humorous and insightful using the images to describe and explain the feelings of tourists 100 years ago.  The period from about 1880 through about 1920 was in some ways the &quot;golden age&quot; of the posed, cabinet-sized black-and-white photograph, and these images carry much more detail (and may be much more physically long-lasting) than today's digital images.  <br />I am giving this book 4 stars instead of five because it was written some years ago (1973, republished 1980).  Since then, more photographs of old Mackinac have been found.  Also, a future photographic history of Mackinac may wish to include &quot;real photo&quot; postcards, which also contain interesting high-quality images.<br />All in all, this is a wonderful book and Mackinac Island lovers are fortunate that it is still in print.	2001-07-12

Walter Lord is trained as a lawyer, and he interviewed his subjects so that they were persuaded and maybe even almost compelled to admit how shocked and disorganized they were on this fateful day.<br />Pearl Harbor was, in strictly military terms, a terrible defeat for America's armed forces. It was also a day that we will always remember because in it we see a deeply flawed but great, peaceful people hurled into war. They had to fight back, and they did.

Until now it has been a collector's item.  <br />In this book, young Richard Halliburton realizes his dreams by traveling around the world with very little money.  I can't summarize here all the places he goes nor all the adventures he sees, but the book is a page-turner from start to finish.  Halliburton climbs the Matterhorn, bums train rides in Spain, gets thrown into jail in Gibraltar, replenishes his empty wallet in Monte Carlo, narrowly escapes incineration on the Indian Ocean, comes face to face with a poisonous snake on the Malay Peninsula, and determines to climb Mount Fuji in winter despite the fact that &quot;it couldn't be done&quot; . . . and, in the end, comes home to Memphis and his mom and dad.   <br />One of the previous reviewers raised troubling questions about Halliburton's place in the twenty-first century.  It's true that the author loves India, and every page in which he describe his travels through that country reflects that love.  It's also true that he didn't respect individual Indians in the way which we all ought to respect each other today.  This is a disturbing question, but my appeal to everyone who reads this review is that people who want a period piece, a description of what it was like for a young man to travel around the world in the 1920s, read this book as a whole and decide whether or not they like it on this basis.  <br />Halliburton wrote about India as a whole.  If we read what he wrote about as a whole, Calcutta and Udaipur and Agra and everything else, we will realize that whatever his faults, he loved the country.  Furthermore, I think that if you read this book as a book of history, a description of a world that no longer exists, you will like it or love it for what it is.	2001-01-30

The author, a longtime Cleveland, Ohio, journalist, had many friends in Great Lakes shipping and was able to draw upon his numerous contacts to produce a series of works that carry with them the smell and sight and sound of the Great Lakes.  <br />&quot;Ghost Ships&quot; is written as a series of article-length stories about Great Lakes cargo vessels that met disaster - in some cases, disaster so complete that no one was left alive to tell the tale of how the boat went down.  Boyer expertly combines contemporary evidence, in many cases gathered from local news stories, to develop believeable theories as to how these &quot;ghost ships&quot; met their end.<br />Some readers may be troubled by Boyer's ability to guess what happened and his ability to blend fact and fiction together to create his tales.  However, all of his stories are firmly grounded (if I can use this word when writing about the water) and the man knew more than any living person how these disasters happened.  Modern technology has lowered the probability of great disasters on the Great Lakes, and as of the Year 2000 there have been no &quot;ghost ships&quot; for the past 25 years.  Long may it so continue.  In the meantime, we have Boyer's fine book.	2000-10-21

People who feel that they have reached a new stage of acceptance of what is happening to them as they move thorugh life's journey will find this book, or any other reasonably accurate translation of the underlying poem, to be a tremendous resource.	2000-10-09

He is a  master canoebuilder who is a living link to the close relationship which  some of his people have to the Upper Great Lakes.  He knows, and loves, the  water in ways that some of us can only dream about.<br />The previous reviewer  who wrote that this book is &quot;nothing to get excited about&quot; just  doesn't get it.  Read it and you will find out about a man who, like all of  us, is lost and confused in some ways, and who is extraordinarily talented  and courageous in other ways.  I want to tell everyone who reads this  review of this courage, so that we will all know it and give Mr. Paquin the  respect which he deserves.	2000-06-28

Reading this book is almost as good as a trip to Northern Michigan.  Cameron has obtained some of the best color-reproduction  craftspeople in the world to print his books, and it shows.  These are not  your ordinary snapshots.  The entire Island is here.  If you ever wanted to  see something steadily and see it whole, this book is a good place to  start.	2000-06-24

It also carries with it the promise of a great career to come.  I believe this is Pressfield's second novel, but he writes as if he has been doing it all his life.  <br />It must  be tough to write about characters that one loves - women and men and  children.  Pressfield has done it.  He is not afraid to do it: not afraid  to talk about what he loves.  If there is a secret to writing books like  this one, this is it.  <br />When we dig up old towns and cities, what we find  is disintegration.  Pieces scattered all over the place.  That is what  being an archeologist is all about.  How is one to make sense of these  pieces and put them back together?  Historians can't do it.  They are  scholars.  There isn't enough data.  If what Pressfield loves is ancient  Greece, and he has the courage to make up characters he loves and listen to  them talking and growing and fighting, he can put the pieces together.  A  corroded shield from a long-ago battlefield, a bit of text from old  Plutarch . . . these things make a story.  <br />This is a novel, but the  story it tells is a true one.  The characters Pressfield shares with us are  men and women who had brothers and sisters who actually existed.  By  throwing away a few years of their lives, they won fame that will never  die.	2000-06-24

The terrible story of how a group of madmen brought sorrow to the planet is brought vividly to life in this classic history.  It is a titanic work on a titanic subject.<br />The  author, Bill Shirer, took some risks.  He interposed his own judgements and  feelings with the facts which he sets down.  Seeing as how Shirer saw the  Nazi regime with his own eyes, and his revulsion is based on his own  experience, and almost all of his readers will share that revulsion, the  risk pays off.  Few historians could take a risk like this, or should.  Because of what Shirer (and the world) saw and suffered, he did right.<br />Do  not rely solely upon this book to learn about the Holocaust.  The section  of this book which retells the story of this ultimate crime is based on  German documents and testimony gathered immediately after the war (and  before almost all of the surviving perpetrators decided to collectively  shut up).  As a result, the section uniformly treats the Jewish and other  prey of the killing system as passive victims.  A balanced view is  required, to say the least, and I am sure that most readers with a strong  enough stomach to tackle this book will go on to read the testimonies of  survivors and get closer to a real view of this almost unbelieveable story.  However, the German sources quoted here at great length are useful should  there be anyone reading this book who is so unfortunate as to believe that  the Holocaust never happened.  It did, and you can read about it here, in  the words and documents of the men with blood on their hands.<br />Once again,  this is a true, scary, unforgettable classic of the art of historical  journalism.	2000-03-13

In the 1910s this was done, as it is done in  every generation, but only with great difficulty and some soul-searching on  both sides.<br />So buy and read this book if you want to read about young  Harry's epic quest.  Bess' letters to Harry are lost, but Harry Truman's  letters are so vivid that their contents can be partly reconstucted.  The  two were real soul mates in the end - in the true sense of this most  over-used phrase.  They could actually converse by letter.  How many of us  are so lucky?<br />Buy and read this book if you want to see these two  attractive people in the vanished world of 1910s Missouri.  If you're  looking for President Harry Truman, you won't find much of him here.  By  1945 this pair had been married and living together for 25 years and were  no longer writing daily letters to each other.  But if you are one of those  people who think that Truman was one of our greatest Presidents because he  never forgot who he was and where he came from, you may want to know where  he came from.  He came from here, in this book.	2000-03-03

He wrote in a time after the invention of the printing press, but before the invention of newspapers and magazines, so the sort of journalism which we rely on today to tell us  more than we want to know about the inner lives of show-business figures  did not exist during his lifetime.<br />Anyone who wants to write a  full-length biography of this man, one of the greatest writers of our  planet, has two choices.  She can either make up stuff along the way, as  countless Shakespeare biographers have done since the 1600s, or she can  stick to the fragmentary facts and fit them into a picture of the social  structure and life that Shakespeare lived in.  This is what Chute does in  her now out-of-print classic, and as readers of this review can see, I  think she did a superb job.  <br />Chute's book is superb not only because she  is a vivid writer, not only because she tells us why certain things were  the way they were, but because she respects the people she is writing  about.  When she tells us why Elizabethan &quot;players&quot; and their  property managers liked tawny-orange dye for their costumes, she not only  tells us why they liked it (it was a &quot;color-fast&quot; dye which would  not fade) but conveys to us some of the combination of freedom and limits  which made up Elizabethan society.  The men and women of London were people  who, on the one hand, could not buy the color-stable, wash-and-wear clothes  we wear without a thought today, but on the other hand, if they could find  a good dye or could afford to wear a bright color, they could gaudy  themselves up in a way which grownups are too shy to do nowadays.  As  always, something has been lost and something has been gained, and Chute  knows this and doesn't write history on the basis of &quot;look at how many  mistakes those poor little people made&quot; or &quot;look at all those  great heroes of the past.&quot;  They are men and women and children whocould have learned from us, and we can learn from them.  All of them,  Shakespeare first among them but not the only one.	2000-02-25

It was written after World War II when many of the members of  the expedition (but not Shackleton) were still alive and could be  interviewed.  This book is their story as much as that of the author,  Lansing. <br />In their stories we see a bunch of men from the Edwardian  British Isles - one of the most class-ridden societies the world has ever  seen - learn to work together.  These men were not perfect.  Every reader  will find someone in the &quot;Endurance&quot; whom he or she will identify  with.  Whatever their flaws, they were able to accomplish the  impossible.<br />Most people who read this review will know how the story  ends, so I am not giving anything away when I say that it is just as much a  triumph of the human spirit as it was when it was first told, decades ago.   Today Lansing's book is both a classic and a best seller, a tribute to the  fact that we need stories like these, and are not ashamed to admit the fact  that we need them.	2000-02-11

It has been published many times, but ought to be reviewed as a set.  Volume One of this set, &quot;The Gathering  Storm&quot;, is scarier than any horror movie ever filmed.  Watch  helplessly as decent people are drawn into the black hole of the worst  tragedy that humankind has ever found itself in.  You will notice that I  ended this last sentence with a proposition.  This reminds me of a story -  one day someone nudged the Prime Minister and reminded him that he, too,  had committed this offense against grammatical decency.  Churchill's  reported response was &quot;This is arrant pedantry, up with which I shall  not put.&quot;	2000-01-25
