It is well-written and gives an excellent defence of the eclectic approach to textual criticism. It shows clearly that the idea that the King James Version is the only inspired one is unbiblical and illogical.<br /><br />The authors of the various articles show that all of the arguments for KJV-Onlyism are based on false information.<br /><br />But the book also contains insights into bible translation and lots of useful information about the manuscripts from which we got our bible, both Old and New Testaments.<br /><br />The writers write respectfully, with due praise for the King James Version and with courtesy to those who hold different points of view to them.<br /><br />I have learnt quite a bit from this book, despite having previously read books such as Carson's The King James Version Debate: a plea for realism [which I also recommend, despite its age.]<br /><br />Warmly recommended.	2005-06-29

If you are puzzled by the Holy Spirit, or by all the different slants in various Christian circles on his ministry, you will find this book enlightening.<br />Packer writes in a forthright, yet fair way. He does not seek to knock other views for the sake of it, but often shows how they have valuable insights, though they may be emphasising some things too greatly, or omitting other essentials.<br /><br />His book is not only about the Holy Spirit, and also features important teaching on the trinity, holiness, Christian living and bible reading.<br /><br />I think this book is every bit as good as Knowing God. I'm sorry that I have only just discovered it.<br /><br />The new edition includes a 2005 \\"Preface to the Preface\\" and a short chapter on assurance, entitled \\"Heaven on Earth -a Pentecost Exposition.\\" They are worth reading, but maybe not worth the cost of a new book if your copy is still in good nick.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-05-27

We believe in a God who is loving and merciful, but who is also holy and cannot abide evil.<br /><br />We rightly focus on the New Testament and its message of love and forgiveness for sins: this book reminds us that our salvation has a bloody history, not only in the torture and crucifixion of Christ, but also in the death of many hundreds of thousands of people, by leaders who believed they were ordered to do this by God himself.<br /><br />Three of the book's contributors understand that Moses, Joshua and David were led by God to wipe out Canaanites, Amalekites, Philistines and others, but Nazarene pacifist C S Cowles believes that the New Testament shows that they were misled.<br /><br />It is worth reading the articles from the different points of view, but also intriguing to read each author's critique of the others' views.<br /><br />I felt that each article was worth having been included in the book, but I would have liked to read what an evangelical pacifist with a high view of the bible would have written, too.<br /><br />Highly recommended	2005-05-09

His book is easy to read, and mainly concentrates on central issues of the faith.<br /><br />I especially appreciate his work on the atonement, and all the multi-faceted aspects of Christ's death and the chapters on the trinity. I think he gives an excellent explanation of the trinity, and I found his comparison of Nicaea versus Calvin's views interesting and well thought-out.<br /><br />My review is based on the first edition, and I eagerly look forward to being able to read his revision of chaper 9 [on The Trinity and the Creeds] in the recently released 2nd edition.<br /><br />As a so-called \\"Credobaptist\\" and sympathiser with New Covenant Theology, I am not advocating his covenant theology or teachings on infant baptism. For those topics, see Wayne Grudem's excellent volume.<br /><br />But I do heartily recommend study of this book which is a result of his 40 years teaching Christian theology.	2005-04-11

Some uses of plurals sound correct when spoken, but may at first appear a little odd when you read them. However, it is most likely that eventually this will seem normal in print as well.<br /><br />To assist us in understanding the Bible, it is helpful to have translations like the TNIV which focus on getting the meaning across and also translations like the NASB which focus more on following the form of the original language.<br /><br />The Old Testament update is only a little different from the 25 year old NIV. When the New Testament was released, it was said that the text differs in 7% of places. My guess is that there is even less change in the Old Testament.<br /><br />If you want a version in contemporary English that is easy to read, I recommend the substantially revised New Living Translation, now known as NLT2.<br /><br />For an understanding of translating the bible into contemporary English, and especially the philosophy of the NIV and TNIV translators, I recommend The Challenge of Bible Translation, edited by Strauss, Voth and Scorgie.	2005-02-25

It opened Paul up for me. Although it was a fairly loose translation, and only taken from the American Standard Version by an untrained bible lover, I still got mad when I read Romans 9, so it was close enough to give me the drift!<br /><br />In about 1970, this developed into The Living Bible, which was a paraphrase which enabled many people to come to grips with the bible for the first time.<br /><br />In the late 1980s, a group of distinguished evangelical scholars revised Taylor's paraphrase, transforming it into The New Living Translation. This version was still easy to read, but much closer to the original.<br /><br />Now in 2005, Tyndale have released The New Living Translation 2, which goes even further in the direction of accuracy. It is an extensive revision, in which few verses have been untouched.<br /><br />If you already use the NLT, you'll find this version is still  the same style of translation, but it is much closer to the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. In some instances it seems to be even more particular than the TNIV, which has also just been released.<br /><br />If you are skeptical of \\"dynamic equivalence\\" translations, I urge you to carefully look at this version. It is still easy to read, but now much tighter. In soem ways it is more \\"literal,\\" but also at times, even more explanatory.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-02-01

So the obvious question is \\"But is my bible the inspired Word of God?\\"<br /><br />Goodrick gives an excellent answer to this question which will satisfy nearly everyone, but not those who would like to hold an inerrant bible in their hands.<br /><br />He says:<br /><br />1. Yes the original is inspired, inerrant, infallible.<br /><br />2. What we have today is 99% or even more the same as this inspired,inerrant, infallible original.<br /><br />If you know the bible well, and are honest you will admit that the bible we have today has discrepancies and apparent contradictions in a very small number of places. If you are familiar with your bible, you will know that there are a few puzzles with your bible which may be transcriptional errors, or may be only apparent contradictions because we don't have all the facts.<br /><br />We also have minor wording and meaning differences between the various bibles we have [including minor differences between various versions of the King James].<br /><br />But none of these affects any Christian doctrine.<br /><br />We can have complete confidence that the bible as we have it today in all major versions is substantially the same in the vast majority of cases as the inspired original.<br /><br />But there is value in limiting what we call inspired, inerrant and infallible to the original, because of the small number of<br /><br />differences between the versions we have today.<br /><br />We dare not make a pronouncement that a particular one is THE Bible, because of *our* fallibility, not the bible's.<br /><br />Worth reading if you have been asking this question.	2005-01-15

It contains helpful description of the evangelical faith, as well as advice for preserving it.<br />Martyn Lloyd-Jones is a Welshman who was one of the most popular preachers in London for many years, and has published many books of bible expositions, especially on Romans and Ephesians.<br />This book is a series of talks to the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students in 1971.<br />Lloyd-Jones begins with a talk on Jude 3 in which he points out the necessity of &quot;earnestly contending for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.&quot;<br />The Christian message, or evangel, he says, is worth fighting for! We must articulate this Christian faith, and also counteract heresy. This is why the early Christian creeds were created.<br />He argues that Christian unity is important, but points out that true Christians are united by Christ, but it is a union based on truth: the truth of God. We must work hard to understand it, and be faithful to it. We are not interested in unity for the sake of it, or to make us look good in the eyes of the world.<br />He says that there are four areas of importance for evangelicals:<br />The importance of<br />1. the preservation of the gospel<br />2. learning from history<br />3. maintaining negatives<br />4. allowing no subtractions from or additions to the gospel<br />Some evangelical priorities he lists include:<br />1. Submit yourself to the Bible.<br />2. Christian faith comes before denomination.<br />3. Be watchful to maintain purity of doctrine.<br />4. Keep reason and scholarship in their place.<br />They are useful tools, but must be subservient to Scripture.<br />5. Take a critical view of tradition and history.<br />6.

This book is sane and helpful. Written in 1939, it would have been so tempting for the writer to identify the cataclysmic events of the time with what we find in Revelation, but instead he has begun by studying the time in which the book was originally written, and thinking about what it would have meant to the first hearers and readers.<br />Hendriksen is one of those who sees the book divided into 7 parallel sections, each of which covers the same territory, but in a different way. His interpretation makes the book meaningful for all Christians in all ages, not just the original recipients and certainly not a select group who live just before the Second Coming of Christ.<br />Whatever books you are using on Revelation, I highly recommend you include More Than Conquerors in your study.	2004-05-07

Some uses of plurals sound correct when spoken, but may at first appear a little odd when you read them. However, it is most likely that eventually this will seem normal in print as well.<br />To assist us in understanding the Bible, it is helpful to have translations like the TNIV which focus on getting the meaning across and also translations like the NASB which focus more on following the form of the original language.<br />I am eagerly awaiting the Old Testament update of the NIV. If it is as good as the New Testament part, this may well become the standard English bible for the first part of the 21st Century.<br />For an understanding of translating the bible into contemporary English, and especially the philosophy of the NIV and TNIV translators, I recommend The Challenge of Bible Translation, edited by Strauss, Voth and Scorgie.	2004-02-08

We had only half an hour there, so it was great to find such an interesting book in the short time available, and then read it on the train back to my niece's home.<br />If you like reading other people's stories about their lives and beliefs, you will enjoy this book. The Christian people included come from a variety of denominations and countries.<br />I enjoyed reading the sermon by Phillips Brooks, the clergyman who penned O Little Town of Bethlehem. The introduction tells us that he rekindled interest in Christ by making chapel attendance voluntary, instead of compulsory, as it had always been.<br />There are many other fascinating glimpses into people's journeys of faith, but the highlight for me was reading about Harvard's spiritual roots and the efforts to reclaim them.<br />Warmly recommended	2004-01-23

At times it sounds quite stilted and unnecessarily formal.<br /> If you liked the New English Bible, I think you will find that this one is a big improvement. There is not as much conjectural emendation in the Old Testament, and the translators are less inclined to move the text around, as was done in translations by Moffat and the NEB.<br />It is well worth getting a copy for the fresh approach.	2004-01-10

Derek Tidball's book takes us through the many different passages where the bible articulates this message, including:<br />Genesis 22 - the story of Abraham obeying God and offering his only son as a sacrifice<br />Exodus 12 - the story of the Jewish Passover<br />Psalm 22 - which foretells many aspects of Christ's suffering on the cross<br />Isaiah 53 - which depicts a suffering servant, taken up in the NT as a prophecy of Christ's death on the cross<br />The accounts in the 4 gospels which while having many features in common, also have their own distinctive emphases<br />Paul's teaching about the cross in Romans 3, 1 Corinthians 1, 2 Corinthians 5, Ephesians 2, Colossinas 1-2, Galatians and Philippians<br />and the perspective of the writers of Hebrews, Peter and John in Revelation<br />The book is written as biblical theology, letting each author give his own point of view. While Tidball believes that these views harmonise, he does not smooth out the distinctions, but allows us to see them in their own settings.<br />This is the best book I have seen on the cross and I unreservedly recommend it.	2004-01-01

In his short write-up and expansion of 4 sermons preached at All Souls Church, Langham Place, London, Stott refers to Bertrand Russell's 1927 public address at Battersea entitled \\"Why I am not a Christian\\" which 30 years later became a collection of essays with that title. However this book is not an answer to Russell, but does make the case for Christianity, making points that Russell never considered.<br />So why is Stott a Christian? In the seven chapters, Stott gives 6 reasons why he is a Christian, and finally an invitation to the reader to respond to \\"the greatest of all invitations\\" from Jesus Christ himself.<br />Stott's six reasons?<br />1. Not because I found Christ, but because he, the Hound of Heaven, pursued me.<br />2. Because I am convinced that the claims of Jesus are true.<br />3. Because of the cross of Christ.<br />4. Because Christianity best explains who we are, both our weaknesses and our glories.<br />5. Because Jesus Christ is the key to true freedom.<br />6. Because human beings have aspirations which only Christ can fulfil.<br />There are less than 140 pages of text, but the book packs a lot into those pages and is highly recommended.	2004-01-01

Those of us who agree with Piper that there are some unique roles for men and women, still understand that women are called to Christian ministry, even if we do not believe they should be leading churches.<br />In Australia some of our complementarian churches have several female ministers, leading women's ministries, etc. The title is unnecessarily offensive to those women.<br />I also agree with the people who pointed out that the book has little to say about its title, excepting for one chapter. Maybe it should be retitled \\"Christian Leaders, We Are Not Professionals, and other articles.\\"<br />There is not really anything new here, as the articles, or something like them, have appeared on the Desiring God website, or in other books.<br />However, the book does contain some excellent articles. Some of those I have enjoyed include:<br />Brothers, Bitzer Was a Banker, which is an apology for continuing to study the biblical languages.<br />Brothers, Show Your People Why God Inspired Hard Texts<br />Brothers, Save the Saints<br />The article on not writing teetotalism into the church covenant [but then more or less insisting on it anyway] is a curious one. I find it hard to see how he has avoided legalism, as he thinks he has. When the bible clearly teaches us to enjoy God's good gift of wine, but also unambiguously tells us not to overindulge, to argue for teetotalism seems to me to be thinking you are wiser than God.<br />With these qualifications, I recommend this book.	2004-01-01

Earlier Bible translations almost always rendered these words as &quot;men&quot; and &quot;brothers.&quot; But it is sometimes obvious that the words are meant to include women as well. At other times it is not so easy to determine. For instance, were women allowed to participate in the selection in Acts 6:3? Did the Samaritan woman only tell all the men about Jesus, or did she speak to women too, in John 4:28?<br />A newer, more up-to-date book, edited by Mark Strauss and others is now available. It addresses the TNIV translation and has helpful articles about the issue of whether a translation should be firstly trying to preserve the form of the original bible text or the meaning. It is called The Challenge of Bible Translation and has articles by Strauus, Carson, Silva and many other thinkers on this issue.	2003-11-29

It is pleasing that he has been prepared to show some of those in his theological neck of the woods where their understanding of translation issues could be improved.<br />The book is at times rather technical, but even in those challenging sections, there is much to gain, if you can plough through Carson's sometimes less than user-friendly writing style. You will also find Mark Strauss' book &quot;Distorting Scripture&quot; well worth reading.<br />(Both books also deal with the issue of dynamic equivalent versus literal translations in an engaging and helpful fashion.)<br />Carson's introduction about the passions aroused by new Bible translations is entertaining. I liked the quote from Bruce Metzger: &quot;Though in previous centuries Bible translators were sometimes burned, today happily it is only a copy of the translation which meets such a fate.&quot;<br />A highlight is Carson's account of his bilingual childhood, and his discovery of the peculiarities inherent in a particular Bible version, when he tried to preach a sermon in French, having prepared it with an English Bible, and vice versa.<br />I also enjoyed Carson's sometimes cheeky ways of showing that our language has changed.<br />Carson has a helpful article in a new book called The Challenge of Bible Translation, in which there are lots of other helpful articles on the issue of translating with a view to firstly preserving the form of the original, or its meaning.<br />Here he refers to presuppositions guiding the production of the ESV and TNIV translations, and gives very helpful guidelines for thinking about issues of bible translation.

He argues that there is a place for corporate worship and that church is more than sitting in a holy building and having my own little quiet time with God, or only meeting for teaching or encouraging others. In his theology of worship, he guards against some of the extremes we find in evangelical churches today. The reflection on David Peterson's &quot;Engaging with God&quot; is stimulating. Some have used Peterson's book to argue that in the New Testament meetings were not for the purpose of worshipping God. Carson points out that though the book shows that worship in the New Testament is meant to be a whole of life thing, and not just something Christians do on Sundays, Peterson still &quot;wants to talk about ... corporate worship in the regular 'services' of the church.&quot;<br />The main sections of the book are written from a variety of perspectives, from formal to fairly free, from liturgical to extemporary.<br />Interestingly, the article by the minister from the more liturgical background, Mark Ashton, argues from his knowledge of Cranmer [the creator of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer] that churches should have more flexibility and freedom. And the articles by those from a less structured eccesiology argue for the use of some liturgy!<br />And Carson suggests we should be using the best of the ways of worship from our brothers and sisters around the world, without becoming self-consciously Multicultural for the sake of it.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-11-26

A couple of years later, people are still using the NIV, in churches, in bible study groups and privately.<br />It is a great modernisation of the RSV, both in its use of gender-inclusive language [despite its being championed by those who are against this] and revision of archaic terms.<br />It is not as easy to read as the NIV, but it does remove many of the unnecessarily masculine words found in the NIV which do not have a Hebrew, Aramaic or Greek masculine word behind them.<br />Unfortunately the revisers insist on translating words such as ADELFOI as masculine in places where they admit the word clearly refers to both men and women, as in Romans 1:13.

I find it hard to see how you could align yourself with one side, without admitting that many of the points the other side makes are also important and must be also taken into account.<br />It also shows that the Dispensationalist camp has much more in it than a quirky take on the Second Coming.

The scholars who wrote the articles are some of the best-known, most-respected evangelical scholars today.<br />Highly recommended.<br />If you would like this book and 17 other helpful books, including the Dictionary of Biblical Imagery, Sinclair Ferguson's New Dictionary of Theology, the New Bible Dictionary and the New Dictionary of Biblical Theology,  also the Essential IVP Reference Collection CD ROM.	2003-06-21

He also stresses the importance of telling others about God's plan to rescue all put their trust in Jesus Christ.<br />His book helps us to see that all Christians believe in God's sovereignty and show this by the way they pray.<br />He tells us what the gospel is and what it isn't, which is one of our great needs today, no less than when this book was written over 40 years ago.<br />He manages to present the essentials of this important topic, without ever using that theological swearword derived from the name of a Frenchman who has been much maligned. Charles Spurgeon would have been proud of him.<br />I have knocked off a star, because I understand the book is exactly the same as it was when first printed, using language which is more masculine than anyone uses today, and based on the King James Version. This would make the book sound odd to many contemporary readers. If you are used to reading books that use such language and such an old Bible version, please add a star.<br />While the whole book is worthy of reading, I think the first chapter is absolutely essential for all Christians to read, because it shows us clearly that although we may not like to think of God controlling the world completely, it is clearly the teaching of Scripture and is the very ground of our confidence that God will bring us safely to be with him forever if we trust in him, and the only basis for keeping on faithfully in presenting the gospel to everyone we can.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-05-03

At times it sounds a bit old-fashioned, and reveals Wilcock's Anglican point of view. But the book shows his high view of Scripture and includes a study guide which we found helpful when we studied Luke in our Bible study group. It took over a year, but this is understandable when you realise that Luke is the longest book in the New Testament and has over 24 chapters.<br />Bear in mind that the study guide contains questions about Wilcock's book, not about Luke itself. But we found it quite easy to adapt the questions so that they were about the Gospel, not the book about the Gospel.<br />I have also enjoyed Wilcock's book on Revelation, also in this Bible Speaks Today series, originally entitled &quot;I Saw Heaven Opened.&quot;<br />Warmly recommended.	2003-04-21

He gives you several interpretations of controversial issues, but also lets you know his own thoughts. If you want a conservative, evangelical treatment of Luke's book about the Early Church, you will appreciate this book.<br />The study guide is helpful, but bear in mind that it is intended to be a guide to Stott's book, not to Acts itself. As we were not studying Stott's book, but Acts, we adapted the questions to suit ourselves, and did not find this too difficult to do.<br />Highly recommended. I am also finding Howard Marshall's Tyndale Commentary useful, as I prepare the studies for our group.	2003-04-21

Hammond's little book of theology was written in 1936, but the edition used now was extensively revised by David Wright in 1968. The title itself reflects its age: no one would dream of using such a title today. Most people would not even be aware of its meaning or where it came from. [It is the King James Version of the last words of 1 Corinthians 14:20, now rendered as \\"in your thinking be mature.\\"]<br />This is still a helpful handbook of Christian teaching, from a Reformed point of view. It is wonderful that it is still being made available.It is useful because it is concise, and because it has handy lists of bible passages at the end of each section, which the author feels justify his understanding of the teachings he is presenting. There are also a few questions, which should help the reader to think through the preceding summaries of Christian teaching. Sometimes bible passages and questions are grouped together.<br />I have knocked off a star because the language is at times dated and because the books recommended have often been superseded by more recent titles.<br />But the book is well worth having and pondering over.<br />For an up to date, longer book of theology, I recommend Wayne Grudem's Introduction to Systematic Theology, also available from Amazon.	2003-04-21

This is how I got my copies.In each book you will find the statement: &quot;Anyone is at liberty to use material from this book, with or without credit... The writer's desire is to further, not restrict its use.&quot;<br />As a child I was taught the Dispensational view of the Second Coming, and was blissfully unaware that it was a very recent development, unknown to the Apostles and everyone else until the mid-Nineteenth Century. Reading Boettner's book was a helpful corrective, combined with reading Robert Clouse's &quot;The Meaning of the Millennium.&quot;<br />It is worth reading Boettner to gain an understanding of Postmillennialism, which is the least-known of the various views held by evangelical Christians [though it is quite prominent in some Presbyterian and Reformed circles].<br />Boettner's books are easily found on the internet, where they are legally available, but it is worth having the hard copy. There is something about a book!<br />Highly recommended.	2003-04-21

Mauro points out the errors in Dispensationalism, as well as opening up the plain meaning of Daniel chapter 9 and Matthew Chapter 24.<br />One helpful feature of the book is his making available extended passages from Josephus, which show how the destruction of the temple in AD 70 fulfilled a lot of what Jesus said in his Olivet discourse.<br />I also recommend reading Mauro's The Hope of Israel.<br />If you want something sane and balanced, put down your Left Behind books, and read this stuff.	2003-04-21

My 1987 edition copy is well-worn. It is good to see that the book is continuing to be updated. Sylvester Mawson's original version was published in 1934!<br />Nearly always, I have been successful in finding expressions I have looked up in these pages. But, if you are like me, a lover of lists, you will enjoy browsing when you are not hunting for the meaning of a word.<br />In my edition, the definitions are not separated into language groups, which means you don't have to know which language the expression comes from. But I would guess that most users of the book would have some idea of the likely section to hunt in. Could be confusing with Italian and Spanish, though!<br />Recommended for all lovers of language.	2003-04-21

The author helps you to know what to do to be an effective Christian by pretending to tell you how to be a bad Christian. It is not surprising that Adrian Plass wrote the foreword, because it is very much in the style of his writing.<br />Here are some snippets which I enjoyed:<br />On the page where you would usually find acknowledgments or a dedication, you will read instead<br />\\"An ineffective Christian never remembers to thank anyone under any circumstances. Might as well learn that before you begin this book.\\"<br />Habit 1: Dichotomize Your Life. Truly ineffective Christians apportion their lives into secular and sacred components.<br />Habit 2: Make tolerance your god. Accept anything and everything. All viewpoints are not only valid but also equal.<br />Habit 20: Seek the quick, self-help solution. Look for easy answers. Trust your instincts.<br />Habit 22: Make music the big issue. Base your musical taste only on style. He even includes a hymn:<br />Come, thou Fount of every blessing<br />Give me what I want today.<br />Entertainment never ceasing<br />Paths of comfort line my way.<br />Lots of fun, but also much to chew on in this little gem.	2003-04-21

He tells us at the very beginning of his book that there is much more to Calvinism than these 5 points, and that they were not invented by Calvin. It is also worth pointing out that they are a response to a submission to the Church of Holland and not an original statement by Calvinist believers.<br />I found Palmer's presentation compelling. I think that if you believe the Bible is authoritative, he has shown that the so-called five points are its teaching [along with much, much else].<br />Palmer's short account of Calvin's perseverance despite opposition and all sorts of illnesses is also a worthwhile feature of this book.<br />If you want to pursue this topic further, I also recommend Loraine Boettner's Reformed Doctrine of Predestination and Wayne Grudem's Systematic Theology for more detailed treatments.	2003-04-21

Erasmus lived just after the invention of printing and used this new technology to publish the Greek New Testament and to retranslate it into Latin, correcting errors that had persisted for over a thousand years.<br />He tells us of Erasmus' strengths and weaknesses. We see him as the instigator of the Reformation, yet a critic of Luther and others who would take what he had begun to the next logical step.<br />He would sometimes stand up for what he believed in, but at other times would deny what he had previously written, to keep in favour with the leaders of the Church.<br />We see Erasmus' perseverance in the face of opposition and many illnesses, but we are also informed of the many contradictions in what he wrote.<br />This is a great book. It is even better than his very good volume on Augustine.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-04-01

It has led many Christians to a deeper understanding of the Bible, and a closer walk with God. One of the book's best features is the way it integrates the various strands of the Bible's teachings into a satisfying union.<br />The book shows our great need of being God-centred, not centred on ourselves. Piper shows us how God himself is properly God-centred, and seeks to bring us the joys of this true focus.<br />Many people have found this book to be life-changing, and I am most certainly one of them.<br />It is worth reading and re-reading.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-02-23

So you get G J Wenham on Genesis and Peter O'Brien on Colossians, for example.<br />Highly recommended.<br />If you would like this book at a bargain price, with 17 other helpful books, including the Dictionary of Biblical Imagery, Sinclair Ferguson's New Dictionary of Theology, the New Bible Dictionary and the New Dictionary of Biblical Theology, Amazon also sells the Essential IVP Reference Collection CD ROM.	2003-01-21

[I don't think what I am saying here detracts from what the authors are saying.]<br />This is an important book, but it is rather tedious to read. I think that the same material could have been presented in 200 pages, without leaving out any of the important points being made.

Many Christian people seem to be unaware of other views, or have dismissed them too quickly. I am disturbed by the enthusiasm for war amongst many Christian people, and would hope that Clouse's book might be a small corrective to this.<br />This topic is worthy of thinking through, because it relates to our understanding of the relationship between the Old and New Testaments and also to the character of the God who is revealed in the Bible.<br />The four writers each present persuasive cases. If this makes you uncertain about your previously held views, it will have been worth reading the book.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-01-20

I was also intrigued by the problem of relating the book of Esther, especially the last few chapters, to our Christian lives today.<br />While I was disappointed to find there was not a single reference to Esther in the book, I have appreciated the way it makes you think through such issues as:<br />What is the relationship between the Old and New Testaments?<br />What is the central message of the bible?<br />How does each passage relate to the central message about? Christ? What does this mean to us as we seek to preach it?<br />The book has stimulated my thinking. It is one that would be worth reading a couple of times, and then consulting as you preach on particular biblical passages.<br />Goldsworthy has some interesting things to say about expository preaching, even sometimes using humour to get his message across.<br />A couple of the interesting things he says:<br />It is easy to preach about the exhortations to holy living in such a way that you ignore grace and bind yourself and your congregation with law again!<br />Preaching from the gospels must be done realising that the message Jesus preached to his first disciples needs to be nuanced in the light of his death, resurrection and ascension.<br />Goldsworthy explains these things much better than me!<br />Highly recommended.	2003-01-20

In many churches, only one view is ever presented, and often this is the most recent one, unknown in the history of the church until the mid-1800s.<br />Books like this one help you to see that evangelical Christians have different ways of interpreting the Bible's teaching about the end of the world. This may prove unsettling at first, but it is good to be aware of other people's views when the New Testament is not as clear as some would like us to believe.<br />It is also helpful to see that the main teaching, that Jesus is coming again to take those who believe in him to be with him forever, *is* clear.<br />Another helpful book, also available from Amazon, is Steve Gregg's Revelation: Four Views - a parallel commentary, which presents several of these views side by side, in their authors' own words.<br />Both books are warmly recommended.	2003-01-20

His account of his own journey on this issue is one of the many helpful features of the book.<br />I also appreciated his discussion of capitalism versus socialism. This is done with grace, and should be helpful to you, whatever point of view you have.<br />As a result of reading this book, I have been challenged to develop a plan for my own giving. I highly recommend this book if you are looking for sensible guidance on Christian stewardship.	2003-01-06

It includes a plentiful supply of short quotations from Augustine, tells the story of his life and gives an introduction to his writings. It is written from an evangelical point of view, but the author's theological perspective is not intrusive.<br />In the course of telling the story, he mentions lots of names of people from Augustine's times who modern readers will not be familiar with. This may be necessary, but it would be helpful if he had told us a little more about some of these people, as on occasion, the story seems to be little more than a string of names.<br />The author is not afraid to tell us where he thinks Augustine made mistakes. He is also fairly generous with him, and explains that many of Augustine's quirky ideas [to us today] are a product of his times.<br />I highly recommend the book as a simple introduction to one of the most important people in Christian history.	2003-01-05

Books	5	19	23	N	N	Short, sensible discussion	Michael Green has written another helpful book that will be very useful to people asking questions about Christianity. It is so good, it is worth buying a few copies so that you can have one available to give away when you are talking about the gospel with friends.<br />He clears up many popular misconceptions such as<br />1. It doesn't matter what you believe, as long as you are sincere<br />2. All religions are pretty much the same<br />3. All religions lead to God<br />4. Jesus is only one of many great religious leaders<br />In the last few chapters, he shows that Jesus is unique because He is the only one who<br />* claimed to be able to show us what God is like<br />* claimed to be able to deal radically with human wickedness<br />* came back to life, showing that his promises were true<br />* promised to live within us and help us to live satisfying lives which are pleasing to God<br />I am not happy with Green's enthusiastic endorsement of the Alpha course, but with this caveat, I heartily recommend this book as a terrific source for people thinking about religion and people who are seeking to introduce their friends to Christ.	2003-01-05

If you enjoy Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, I think you will appreciate Father Brown. This edition is a great bargain-priced introduction.<br />Father Brown is the archetypal bumbler who is actually quite adept at finding out who committed the crime. He is the ordinary citizen who beats the police at their own game.<br />I got addicted to short stories about 35 years ago when I was at high school. I began reading them in the yellow-covered Gollancz science fiction short story collections. There is something to be said for a story that you can read at a sitting.<br />Chesterton's stories are now public domain. You can sample them online, but it is much nicer to have a book to browse away from the computer!<br />And this is such an unbeatable price, I am buying several copies to give as excellent, but inexpensive gifts.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-09-22

It gives information about people you have, or should have heard of, and forces you to think through the relative value of various professions and great people.<br />For instance:<br />Is science more influential than music? Is religion as influential as art? How could we have allowed an evil person like Hitler to be so influential? Was Bach more influential than Einstein?<br /><br />A great book to read and re-read. A must for every bookshelf. [You can easily find Hart's list in a web-search, but don't cheat yourself. Get the book and read it!]<br />It is interesting to see how Hart revised his list for the second edition.	2002-06-23

I would have thought that several others had had as great an impact as Taylor's paraphrase.<br />The articles about each book chosen are short and to the point. Sometimes there could have been a little more detail, particularly about lesser-known works.<br />This book should get people talking about Christian books that have made an impact on them. Warmly recommended.	2002-06-23

It is different from any other biblical studies resource I have seen. It covers ground that is not really treated in such depth in other aids.<br />You do still need to use standard bible dictionaries and commentaries, in my opinion. But, used in conjunction with them, it is going to really open up the Bible for you.<br />I am disappointed that the editors decided that they would not let you know who wrote the various articles. Their argument is that their editorial work has not left the research done by the various contributors unchanged, and that it would be misleading to append a given contributor's name to an entry, when they have often extensively revised that entry. I feel they should have let us know about their editorial work, AND shown the contributors' names at the end of each entry.<br />The articles dealing with the imagery in each biblical book are very helpful. Here is an example of what you will find:<br />The article on Colossians gives some insights into the purpose of Paul's letter, the image of the cosmic Christ, the motifs of knowledge and fullness in Colossians and the metaphorical use of circumcision.<br />Many of the images referred to in each article on Bible books are also given more in-depth treatment in individual articles.<br />This book is one of the most interesting aids to biblical study I have seen. Highly recommended.<br />If you would like to purchase the work at a bargain price, Amazon also sells the Essential IVP Reference Collection CD ROM, which contains this great work, and 17 other helpful biblical resources.  In some ways, the electronic version is more useful than the book.	2002-06-20

It is reasonably easy to understand, and shows how language works and how we can easily get tripped up in our efforts to interpret it, in a stimulating and entertaining manner. His book is short, and definitely worth reading a few times.<br />If you find yourself disagreeing with his conclusions, think carefully about what yours are based on. Is it a great sermon or a cherished theory, or is it based on careful biblical study?<br />Other thought-provoking books by Carson which give examples of his exegetical method include his &quot;Inclusive Language Debate: a plea for realism,&quot;&quot;The Difficult Doctrine of the Love of God&quot; and &quot;Showing the Spirit,&quot; which is an exposition of 1 Corinthians 12-14.<br />Carson is bilingual, having been brought up in Canada where he and his father preached in both English and French. He shows how this has helped in his study of language and of the Bible in his book on the inclusive language debate. The insights he has discovered make him well worth reading.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-05-27

The church is Bethlehem Baptist in Minneapolis, Minnesota: what else could you call the magazine but The Star?<br />As others have commented, this is not your ordinary book of meditations: it includes reflections on the wrath of God as well as the love of God, and musings on subjects as varied as &quot;Enduring the Pain of a Flawed Marriage&quot; and &quot;The Power of Books and How To Read Them.&quot;<br />Several of the short pieces tell the story of a great Christian. This is one of Piper's best gifts to the church. He has a wonderful way of telling a story and pointing us to Jesus.<br />One reviewer was put off by some of the subjects. Some of them may irk us, but these jabs may be used by God to make us better people, as we reflect on them.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-05-26

It makes you think about what the New Testament tells us about Jesus, and what he says about himself. It shows clearly how Jesus is above all who came before him. Over and over, he says and does the things that only God does. Thus it would be an excellent book for a person who is unsure of Christ's divinity.<br />The book also makes you think about the relationship of the Old Testament to the New, and the Christian's relation to Old Testament [and New Testament] teaching. Do Christians have to obey the Old Testament law, or only &quot;the law of Christ?&quot; What does the NT mean by &quot;the law of Christ?&quot; These are issues all Christians must consider.<br />The book provides a penetrating overview of the Gospel of Matthew, showing how Matthew's aim is to present Jesus as the One who fulfills all the promises of the Old Testament. This helpful introduction to Matthew is followed up by informative exegesis of Matthew 5:17-20, which is a key passage in our understanding of the Christian's relationship to the law, the Old Testament and Christ.<br />New Covenant Theology aims to be a middle ground between the Covenant Theology of Christians of Reformed persuasion and the Dispensational Theology which is subscribed to by Christians of both Reformed and Arminian points of view.<br />You will definitely be inspired by reading this book, whether or not you agree with the authors' conclusions.	2002-05-09

Grudem has the knack of writing profoundly, yet simply.<br />In his book, he discusses most issues an evangelical would be interested in, and he fairly presents the views of those he disagrees with.<br />I like his questions and hymns at the end of each chapter. It is also helpful that he tells you explicitly where he is coming from in his introduction.<br />This book is a terrific start if you want to explore Christian theology. There is also a shorter version of the book, but I think you would be cheating yourself if you didn't buy the whole shebang. [You don't have to read it all!]<br />Although I think Grudem and the Council for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood are a little astray in their views on bible translation, I am happy to enthusiastically recommend this book, which does not stray into that area.	2002-05-08

In it, Carson carefully categorises the Bible's message about God's love. He shows how the different strands fit together.  He affirms God's love for all the world and his particular love for those he has chosen. He shows how John can tell us in his gospel that God loved the world, but tells us not to in his first letter!<br />He discusses the popular, but recent interpretation of the meaning of two Greek words used in John 21 in more detail than he did in his excellent, earlier book &quot;Exegetical Fallacies.&quot; Since reading his argument, I have become convinced of his view that the two words do not have great differences in meaning in the New Testament (or in the Greek translation of the Old Testament).<br />At times, Carson's writing is not easy to read, but this book is one of his most lucid.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-05-06

It is pleasing that he has been prepared to show  some of those in his theological neck of the woods where their understanding of translation issues could be improved.<br />The book is at times rather technical, but even in those challenging sections, there is much to gain, if you can plough through Carson's sometimes less than user-friendly writing style. You will also find Mark Strauss' book &quot;Distorting Scripture&quot; well worth reading.<br />(Both books also deal with the issue of dynamic equivalent versus literal translations in an engaging and helpful fashion.)<br />Carson's introduction about the passions aroused by new Bible translations is entertaining. I liked the quote from Bruce Metzger: &quot;Though in previous centuries Bible translators were sometimes burned, today happily it is only a copy of the translation which meets such a fate.&quot;<br />A highlight is Carson's account of his bilingual childhood, and his discovery of the peculiarities inherent in a particular Bible version, when he tried to preach a sermon in French, having prepared it with an English Bible, and vice versa.<br />I also enjoyed Carson's sometimes cheeky ways of showing that our language has changed.<br />It would be helpful if Strauss and Carson could update their books to evaluate the TNIV and other versions completed since their books appeared in 1998.	2002-05-05

Earlier Bible translations almost always rendered these words as &quot;men&quot; and &quot;brothers.&quot; But it is sometimes obvious that the words are meant to include women as well. At other times it is not so easy to determine. For instance, were women allowed to participate in the selection in Acts 6:3? Did the Samaritan woman only tell all the men about Jesus, or did she speak to women too, in John 4:28?<BR>  <BR>It would be helpful if Strauss and Carson could update their books to deal with the TNIV and other Bibles completed since their books were published in 1998.	2002-05-05

After the 11th September outrage, How can people take a teaching seriously which proclaims that God is good, and yet completely in control of the world? Could a good God really be all-powerful, and yet allow (or even ordain) atrocities like that?<br />The contributors show that a proper understanding of the Bible involves believing that God is indeed sovereign, yet also loving, just and good.<br />John Piper's helpful chapter asks the question &quot;Are there 2 wills in God?&quot; And then seeks to show that God does indeed &quot;fulfil all his will&quot; and yet &quot;is not willing that any should perish.&quot;<br />S.M. Baugh discusses the meaning of &quot;foreknowledge&quot; in the Bible, and argues persuasively that God's foreknowledge must mean a lot more than knowing what is going to happen in the future.<br />Jerry Bridges shows that a belief in the sovereignty of God has practical implications for everyday living, while Samuel Storms explains how it is worth praying to a God who has already decreed &quot;the end from the beginning.&quot; In fact, he argues that there is not much point in praying to a God who is not in complete control of his world.<br />This book has been one of the most helpful explanations of Calvinism which I have read. Highly recommended.	2002-04-25

Schreiner is a disciple of John Piper: if you have read his books, especially Future Grace, you will already know the explanation the book presents.<br />What I like about this book is that it makes sense of the whole NT and does not try to view its message through a narrow lens. The writers have done a great job of making sense of the promises *and* warnings we find in the NT.<br /> ... they are faithful to Reformed theology, while still making sense of NT teaching on doing good works.<br />This is an encouraging book which will stimulate all God's children to persevere and keep running the race to the very end, knowing that they do so because it is God who is energising them.	2002-03-17

It is so much like it, I think it should be called the Extremely Similar Version. It is frequently word for word the same.<br />Its useful features include making the RSV's masculine-oriented language inclusive, where the original does not use a masculine word. For example, in Matthew 5:11 the RSV begins \\"Blessed are you when men revile you ...\\" but the ESV substitutes \\"others\\" because there is no masculine word in the original text. Consequently, this version contains much more inclusive language than the NIV, whose last update was in 1984.<br />It also modernises the RSV by changing the \\"thees\\" and \\"thous\\" used in addressing God to \\"you.\\" Some words that now sound old-fashioned are also put into more contemporary English. <br />But the translators are squeamish about using inclusive language where the original text uses masculine language, even where they admit that the author intended to be inclusive. See for example, Romans 1:13 and its footnote. ADELPHOI is always translated as \\"brothers,\\" even where it is clear that the writer intends to include men and women. However, they have at least provided footnotes, alerting the reader to the writer's intention.<br />Unfortunately they retain archaic theological words such as \\"propitiation,\\" which means that it may bewilder those who do not already have a grasp of biblical theology. The ESV is well worth using in conjunction with other bibles, but I will be disappointed if conservative churches adopt it as the version to be read in church, because it will entrench a masculine-oriented language which is no longer used in the community. [I speak as a complementarian, who would prefer a Bible which cautiously uses inclusive language, where it is obvious that this is the authors' meaning.]<br />It is ironic that the NIV Bible, now out of favour with the ESV's intended audience, was published as an alternative to the RSV, because of the RSV's perceived liberalism. Now, with a few light changes, the RSV is back in favour again, and the NIV is the version some evangelicals \\"love to hate\\"!	2001-11-03
