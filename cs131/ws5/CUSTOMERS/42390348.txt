This is a rather pessimistic appraisal of the Zionist movement, and an apologetic treatise on Britain's failure to live up to its promises to that movement.  While it condemns European inaction during the Holocaust as well as anti-Semitism from every direction, it comes out as pro-Palestinian in its analysis of their \\"right\\" to the levantine lands and does not seriously consider the Jewish claim.  (The fact of enormous Arab immigration to Palestine AFTER the founding of Zionism in the 1890's is stated only as an afterthought, and he disputes the historic fact that the Palestinian Arabs were told to leave their homes to allow invading armies to destroy the Jews in 1948.)  Even while Laqueur admits that the Jewish people may have a claim to nationalism, it is clear from his choice of commentary that he believes them to be too long away from their ancient home to have any stake in it.  He also strongly advocates Jewish assimilation into host nations of the diaspora, which is disturbing as it minimalizes and trivializes the plight of the Jewish people, which continues to this day.	2005-07-22

When I started it, I couldn't read, pronouce, or write one syllable of Hebrew.  I'd sat through many awkward services in my life, reading the English translation of what everyone else seemed to understand.  Now, after going through this book twice in one week, I can read and pronounce Hebrew at a glance, and I'm beginning to write and read written Hebrew script.  It's incredible.  If you want to learn Hebrew, before you begin any other series, get your letters down first.  This book is totally worth buying.	2005-07-14

Murasaki was indeed a remarkable character, and the first half of the novel does a wonderful job in constructing what her early life may have been like, but the author's creation of her character's romantic preference for women denies the historical hetero orientation of \\"The Tale of Genji\\".  To paraphrase Virgina Woolf, authors should write from the perspective of all people, WITHOUT AGENDAS.	2005-04-06

It takes the biblical narratives of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs of the Jewish people and twists them so that Jacob, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah are portrayed as idolaters who worship Mesopotamian gods and have only the basest possible morality.  It is a feminist \\"retelling\\" of one of the chief stories of Genesis, presenting biblical men in the worst possible light, with Jacob as a greedy, lustful, misogynistic self-seeking weakling.  The historical accuracy of this book is also practically non-existant; Rachel is made a blonde, which is obsurd considering that she lived in ancient Mesopotamia, which is today modern Iraq.  One of the few saving graces of this book is that the writing is superb; but it is not enough to convince you to wade through this river of lies.	2005-04-06

I loved the rich description of Mary's everyday activities; they brought  an historical reality to the work which is often missing in period pieces.  But her accented speaking and (purposely) poorly written entries (to give Mary's writing historical authenticity) become tiresome.  The plot is heavily based around events from the original Jeckyll and Hyde tale; it is very much a piece of fan fiction, so to speak, and in some respects Mary is - literally - a &quot;Mary Sue&quot;, or a character inserted into a created world as a placeholder for the author.

A woman commits arson, purposefully killing two of her three children and their pets, but the reason for her actions are left unstated.  This is one story that Rule should have dropped; she admits that no one connected with the crime or family wanted to talk to her (except a few of the key players), leaving her bereft of the deep material she usually presents in her work.  Tantalizing hints of psychological abuse and personality disorder are dangled before us, though never validated or discounted.

It is not flashy, exploitative, or predictable.  Although the victim and others hurt by Tom Capano were not totally innocent, Anne Rule does not present them as such; yet she manages to show appropriate compassion for those whose lives were torn apart, never to be mended.  Thomas Capano was a manipulative monster, a terrible adversary to be faced; Anne Marie is portrayed clearly as a woman whose childhood predisposed her to be hunted by a sick man.  The writing is excellent, especially her information about the Mid-Atlantic states.  Buy this one; you'll want to read it again, someday.	2002-07-30

B.B. is too cruel, self-centered, and deluded; Margo cannot stand up for herself, even when her happiness could depend on it.  That a mother would not lock her 15-year old daughter in the attic to stop her from having an affair with a grown man is laughable at best, morally skewed at worst.

Astrid Magnussen is the most convincing anti-hero of literature since Nabokov's Humbert Humbert, and Fitch's critical stance toward contemporary American life is as timely and valid.  &quot;White Oleander&quot; is American myth, flipped; justice, beauty, perserverance, success, triumph, even survival are shown to be dreams of the entitled classes.

It was written not long after her husband's death, and I believe that her grief shows through in this novel, blotting out the strength of the novel's imaginary world -- always a mistake for a writer.  The male character is strangely feminine, not passive but almost a woman in a man-suit, making him seem unbelievable.  I never felt attached to the Gaitlins or Sophia, as I loved the characters of Tyler's other novels, including her latest, well-written and memorable novel, \\"Back When We Were Grownups.\\"   Read it if you must, but please do not believe that this is the height of Tyler's capability.

Luckily, this book so urgently describes teen \\"first love\\" that her writing style need not be considered.  Although many have complained that the sex scenes are far too graphic, I disagree; they do not totally convey the physical realities of sexual encounters.  Judy Blume effectively sanitized the sex act for her chosen parent/teen audience of readers.

Through a series of publically unimportant, though personally tragic human losses, two people meet who seem to have nothing in common except the most basic need of a mate.  What they actually have in common, however, is their method of &quot;navigating&quot; life: their vision fixes on one goal, as ancient mariners fixed a telescopic gaze on a star, or the horizon, to guide them across the trackless oceans.  The protagonists' desire to reach their goals in a world they do not understand determines every decision each one makes, even if it is wrong, will lead to disaster, or will ultimately break their hearts.  The same may be said for almost every other character.  You will not regret this read.	2002-07-14

The story is so timeless that it could occur today, and it is amazing that Nabokov's criticisms of the United States after WWII still hold true in the Digital Age.  Humbert Humbert, \\"Lolita\\"'s anti-hero, was psychologically blunted in youth by the death of his \\"first love\\", leading him to continually search for a replacement.  His inappropriate affection for pre-adolescent girls leads his entire life - one that held much promise - to ruin.  Delores Haze, though hardly an innocent herself, is still a child, a fact that Humbert ignores until her youth is depleted.

Such weak characters deserve no time pulled  from the busy life of an avid reader.  If you want to  read Anna Quindlen at her best, pick up a copy of &quot;Black and Blue&quot;.  Don't waste your time with &quot;Object Lessons&quot;.	2002-01-07

But this book has made me change my mind.  Sailor Moon is good, but Fushigi Yugi is GREAT, and more mature.  The romance is thrilling; Tamahone and Hotohori are GORGEOUS.  Miaka is a heroine with whom we can associate; she's not the best looking and she makes mistakes, but she has a good heart, and she's brave.  If you are slightly tired of watching blonde, buxom Sailor Moon get ahead because of her looks, consider this instead.	2002-01-07

The book is quite exciting, especially for its realistic plot.  Ann is a true heroine, though one who emerges from the book deeply scarred.  Still, the characters and situations are true to life.  Ann's mother, Adele, acts exactly as an abusive, psychotic individual would behave, and  Ann responds in the same way as an abused child.  Also, for those who claim that Ann is emotionless, remember that her feelings are reflected in her descriptions of places and people; she reflects herself upon them in her recollection, and what comes through is tremendous pain.  Those who have been wounded in life will deeply associate with this book.	2001-12-08
