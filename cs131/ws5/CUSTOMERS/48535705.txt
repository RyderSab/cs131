At first it was a little slow, however towards the end it became quite explosive! I now understand why there was such much explaining in the beginning, since there are two other books to follow. It is worth the money you spend on it.  The only problem is waiting on book #2 to come out.  Hurry up Teri!!!  Don't leave us hanging for long.  Pick the book up and read it.  It's more than enjoyable.	2004-02-09

It will have you happy, angry and sad.  Kaia's goes through some real tough times, but with love, loyalty and friendship, she is able to come to grips with all that life has thrown at her.  Now this book is not your typical &quot;street life&quot; book, but has the elements.  You will find yourself hating certain characters, while loving others.  I laughed and cried while reading this book.  This is a must read.  It was simply wonderful!	2004-02-09

Dollar had the right intentions, just went about it the wrong way. I do not think the book was dragged out as one reviewer has suggested, instead it gave you insight into why Dollar did and made the decisions he made.  I truly thought he would get out of the &quot;game&quot;.  Never expected it to end the way it did.  Excellent read!!!!<br />Now I can't wait for the sequel to &quot;The Root Of All Evil&quot;.	2004-02-09

We now understand why Roxy Winters was in Paris to begin with and how she got there.  We also understand why she chose the path she chose.  However, the best character in the entire novel was Nicky.  She told it like it was and didn't bite her tongue.  I would like to read a novel centering around her character.  She was quite strong despite the horror she went through.	2003-08-27

I had it on my Amazon wish list for months.  I read the reviews more closely and decided to purchase it.  Boy, am I glad I did!  This book was excellent.  Lyric was a trip.  Don't cross her.  But in reality she was lonely and wanted a real relationship.  Her two best friends, Madison and Portia were a handful. Madison appears to have her act together, but you will soon find out that she doesn't.  Portia is just plan \\"Ghetto\\".  She's really smarter than she wants to admit.  Joshua just couldn't keep his pants on and his wife, Parker, had reason's for doing what she did, until she realizes she is the only one that can make her happy.<br />There is much drama in this book and a surprise at the end, that will leave your mouth hanging open.  Ms. Winslow did an excellent job.  The characters were well developed and the story flowed.  You never had to re-read a passage to find out who was actually talking.  Excellent book.  A must read.  Can't wait for her next novel.	2003-08-18

Yarni's character was well thought out and the author really gave you an insight into the trials and tribulations Yarni had to go through.  I do not believe she made the characters in the book heriones, as one reviewer suggested, but she gave us an insight into the life of a hustler and their girlfriends.  I've never dated a hustler, so I wouldn't know what they go through, let alone their families, friends and girlfriends.<br />Although hustling is their life, they still are human and have human emotions like anybody else.  Yarni's mother Gloria was a rock.  Many of us have mothers/sisters/aunts who we all can depend on no matter what because they love us unconditionally.  The love Gloria had for Yarni was unconditional, as the love Yarni felt for Des.<br />I truly enjoyed the book. Great job Ms. Turner.  Can't wait for the next one.	2003-08-11

When I read the first few pages I couldn't get into the language, but when I took a deap breath and read a little more slowly, I couldn't put this book down.  I finished it in one day.  Although Lou-Loc was a hustler/gangsta, I was cheering for him to succeed.  There was so much action and drama, I thought I was reading a screenplay.  It had you laughing and crying.  K'Wan, your book was a masterpiece.  I can't wait for the next one.  Excellent job.  Anyone who reads this book will not be disappointed.	2003-08-11

It had me laughing out-loud.  Queenie would tell it like it was and didn't care if your feelings were hurt or not.  I don't want to give away too much of the book, but we have all been in Queenie's shoes when it comes to a man. Her girlfriend Poe is a trip.  It's funny how a man can have you doing things you wouldn't normally do.  Please read this book and when you get to the character of Brooda, please come back and write a review and let us know what you thought.  That Brooda had me rolling on the floor.<br />Can't wait for Ms. Phillips next novel.	2003-08-05

I had to keep reading to find out what was going to happen.  As African-American's we face all sorts of discrimination on a daily basis.  But in corporate america it is much worst even when we are more qualified both professionally and educationally. I felt everything Anise was going through and the choices she made regarding her career.<br />This book isn't filled with &quot;ghetto drama&quot;, but the drama Anise has to face on a day to day basis.  I highly recommend that you pick this book up, you will not be disappointed.  I truly enjoyed every page.	2003-08-05

The author is writing a series inter-mingling the characters from Soulmates Dissapate, Never Again Once More and He's Just a Friend, into her next novel and I can't wait.<br />Fancy Taylor is selfish and self-centered.  She is out for only one person and that is herself.  At first I didn't feel sorry for her, but as you read the novel and come to understand why she does the things that she does, you can't but help feel sorry for her.<br />Desmond believes he loves Fancy, but she does him wrong repeatedly, but he is always there for her.  Her best friend, SaVoy is a little naive when it comes to relationships between men &amp; women, but as the novel progresses, you will find out why she is as naive as she is.<br />I don't want to give away any real details of the story line, but would highly recommend you read this one ASAP.  Do not wait for it to come out in paperback.  Go buy the hardback, you will not be disappoined.<br />Way to go Mary Morrison!  Can't wait for the next one.	2003-08-01

Innocent and Noire really got on my nerves.  For Innocent to be 33-34 he couldn't make up his mind what he really wanted and nor could Noire.  Now I will say the author did a wonderful job of detailing all of the places the characters visited, I will give her that.  But this book could have been sumed up in fewer pages.  They were either going to get together or they weren't. Didn't like it. If you want to read it, wait on the paperback or borrow it from a friend.	2003-07-29

From reading the book, you would think the main character was much older than she was. But I guess that came from what she went through.  It also gives you an insight into sister girlfriends!

It gave us an insight into what really goes on in a man's head/thoughts.  It showed that men and women both play games when it comes to matters of the heart.  I was disappointed when Brendan destroyed his relationship with his best friend and surprised as to who he actually ended up with.  Nate tried to have his cake and eat it to, and in the end it caught up with him.  By the way, what did Nate do for a living???   I realize the book was told from the standpoint of Cory.  However, I wanted to read more dialogue between the characters and not so much narration. There was some drama, but it was more towards the end of the book than in the beginning.  However, for a first time author, he did a pretty good job.	2003-07-25

The way the author describes the ship is wonderful especially for those who have never been on a cruise ship before.  Miles was immature, but came around towards the end.  Why Mia puts up with his nonsense was a question I had in the back of my mind.  But when you love someone, that love can make you do some real stupid things.  I truly believe there should be a sequel.  I want to know more about the captian and the cruise director.  Also, do Mia and Miles last?	2003-07-18

If you are in the age category of 20 to 30, I do believe you can relate more to the characters in the book, because they are young and trying to find their way.

I finished the book in 1 day. I just couldn't put it down.  The issues Sydney is dealing with taking care of her mother alone when there are other siblings, is one we all can relate to.  Rick taking a non-commital stance with his finance is all too real.  The abuse Gina suffers happens more often in america's households than we can believe.  At first I was mad at Gina and thought that her character was stupid, but unless you are in that person's shoes, you have no idea what they are actually going through.  Deloris' character was one we all know, if you have a loving mother who has a strong faith in God.  This is a book that I would recommend you read.  It's an easy read and once you get started, you will not want to put it down until you are finished reading it.  Please do not pay any attention to the reviews by the so-called critics, they have no idea.  Read the book!	2003-06-27
