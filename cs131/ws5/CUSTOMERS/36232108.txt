The former is rather shy, he likes to play with a doll and enjoys indoor games whereas the latter has a bolder character. They grow up in Cleveland and experience the kind of \\"reckless overnight friendship particular to those who are young.\\" After college they move to New York where they live in an improbable mnage  trois with a girl called Clare. A few years later they move to the country where \\"their\\" - there are two likely fathers - daughter Rebecca is born. <br />The novel features an endless succession of rather banal events, people moving in different directions never quite knowing what their destination should be or what motivates them to do what they are doing. What is the author talking about? Is he describing the love between teenage boys? Their relationship with their parents? Their parents slowly becoming old? A couple of gay men living together with a woman? A woman who inexplicably wishes to have a child by a gay father? A trio trying to raise a child? Unfortunately there is no answer to these interesting issues in the novel because the author keeps the text at the level of mere actions, never pausing to reflect more deeply on what motivates people to perform a particular action. An altogether disappointing novel.	2005-10-03

For Matt Franklin and his comrades in arms, robbing a Securicor van should have been a routine operation but things didn't turn out the way they should have and the result was a disaster. Two of Franklin's companions are shot dead and a third one severely injured. Who is trying to wipe them and their families out? Could it be that the British army and government were implicated in the massacre? What lies behind the walls of a mysterious and secret research centre in the English countryside? <br />Finally the only one left alive, Matt Franklin, with the help of DI Crane, becomes involved in a series of events that lead to the climax in the London underground. <br />Such novels are to literature what instant soups are to gastronomy. They taste bad because the ingredients are miserable: guns, cars, blood, explosions, pursuits...

Here is a small selection of those I've enjoyed most. <br />In \\"Under The Garden\\" William Wilditch, after spending a long time abroad, is now visiting the family house, Winton Hall, which he hasn't seen since his childhood and where his brother George lives. After the first night, Wilditch finds it difficult to distinguish between memories and fantasy, fact and dream. He remembers a dream he had as a child when he entered a dark cave on the island in the middle of the pond in the garden. In that cave he met two rogues: Javitt, a sententious old man who had lived there for many years with a mute woman, Mary. <br />In \\"A Visit To Morin\\" a narrator, Dunlop, remembers admiring a French author called Pierre Morin who was controversial in the 1950s because he was accused of Jansenism while others called him an Augustinian. Dunlop spots Morin at a Midnight Mass in a village near Colmar. After introducing himself to the author, he is invited to his house where they have an astonishing conversation during which Morin reveals to Dunlop that long after he ceased to believe in God, he still remains a carrier of belief through his books. <br />A patient suffering from leprosy in \\"Dream Of A Strange Land\\" in Switzerland is driven to a desperate action because he can't get his doctor's help. Indeed the doctor's house has been transformed into a casino to accommodate the Herr General, now too weak to travel to Monte Carlo. Not only does the patient think he went to the wrong house but he thinks he is in the wrong country as well, Germany probably... <br />In \\"A Discovery In The Woods\\" a group of strange children with short and uneven limbs who move like crabs decide that they should enter a new territory in search of blackberries. Thus they leave the confines of their village, Bottom, and they discover an enormous house resembling a giant stranded fish which seems to have been thrown up among the rocks to die. <br />An \\"old sterile thing\\" is the way the American woman in \\"Beauty\\" is described. She is desperately calling after her Pekinese dog Beauty in the night. But Beauty left her mistress for a well deserved nocturnal ramble in the dirt of the city. <br />Madame Volet in \\"Chagrin In Three Parts\\" lost her husband to Emmy with whom he fell in love. Her friend Madame Dejoie tries to console her by suggesting that satisfaction can be achieved if only one can discover in oneself \\"the capacity for love\\" for another woman! <br />Henry Cooper in \\"The Overnight Bag\\" travels on a BEA flight from Nice to London carrying in his BOAC overnight bag what he claims to be his wife's \\"dead baby\\". <br />In \\"Mortmain\\" Philip Carter's new marriage to Julia is jeopardised by a series of notes hidden in their apartment by his former wife Josephine. <br />Mary Watson in \\"Cheap In August\\" is taking a holiday in Jamaica where she meets an unhappy and lonely American, Henry Hickslaughter. Because Mary really went on holiday to look for an adventure she can't help feeling that her attachment to the old man is cheap in the same way as everything is cheap in Jamaica in August. <br />A young woman author appraised by her publisher for her \\"power of observation\\" turns out to have no power of observation whatsoever in \\"The Invisible Japanese Gentlemen\\". <br />In \\"Awful When You Think Of It\\" a man on a train has an imaginary dialogue with a fellow passenger's baby and he tries to picture what kind of adult that baby will become. <br />\\"Doctor Crombie\\" portrays a school doctor living at the beginning of the 20th century who is convinced that there is a correlation between sexual intercourse and cancer: \\"Almost one hundred percent of those who die of cancer have practised sex\\" he claims! <br />In \\"Two Gentle People\\" Marie-Claire Duval and Henry Graves meet in the Parc Monceau in Paris, then have dinner together only to realise that the hour came too late in both their lives... <br />A wonderful collection ofshort stories by one of the greatest British authors of the 20th century.	2005-09-27

Hawthorne tells the tragic tale of a fallen woman, Hester Prynne. In his essay entitled \\"The Custom House\\", the author pretends to have found a mysterious relic of cloth in the shape of the letter along with a manuscript in which a certain Jonathan Pue described the letter's wearer. <br />Thus the character of Hester Prynne was born, this adulteress who has to wear the shameful letter A embroidered on her garment in scarlet letter and insolent gold thread. Her error is adultery and the Puritan magistrates of colonial Boston decided that she should wear the bright letter affixed to her breath. In the opening scene, Hester is standing dishonoured before the town holding another man's child just as her long-lost husband Roger Chillinworth arrives in Boston. The story is tightly constructed and takes place in 24 chapters with the action in the first, the twelfth and the last revolving around the scaffold on which Hester suffers her punishment. The structure is taught and essentially limited to the description of the three adult characters of Hester Prynne, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale and Roger Chillingworth, each in turn wearing various masks to hide themselves from the failures of the human heart. Hester never reveals her lover's identity thus protecting her from public disgrace but not from his interior sense of guilt. At any rate she is a strong character, a rebel dwelling in solitude which grants her freedom of thought, particularly concerning the fate of women: \\"The world's law was no law for her mind\\" the author writes. To the reader she appears as a fascinating creature, captivating, rebellious, even intimidating. The dnouement is equally startling. After Hester's daughter Pearl marries, she returns to the small abandoned cottage and resumes her former life, not being able to remain an expatriate, the scarlet letter now voluntarily clamped to her bosom as if it were part of her true identity. Her triumph finally lies in her willingness to take up the mark that identifies her as a woman.	2005-09-26

Its centre is plagued by an incessant drought whereas its northern part is permanently covered by a coat of ice. Mara and Dann are respectively seven and four when they become orphans. They are brought to a place called The Rock Village and it is Daima who takes care of them. A few years later they begin their epic journey from the centre of Ifrik to its northern part where there is more water and consequently more food. During their trip they come across all kinds of primitive peoples living in very poor conditions and in many instances Dann and Mara have to fight in order to survive. <br />It is an apocalyptic world which Mrs Lessing imagined for her novel. One in which people live in tribe-like colonies and behave in a very aggressive manner toward each other. It is a world in which all scientific knowledge has been lost and in which there is no more room for culture or art. There are cities which were once splendid and now have either turned into ruins or have been submerged by floods. Nature has become so hostile that it is barely possible for people to inhabit the centre of Ifrik. There are giant spiders, water dragons, enormous lizards and huge beetles who can bisect a child with their pincers. A frightening vision of the future of our planet indeed. <br />Readers will no doubt be comforted by the fact that there are still authors today who manage to write a powerful adventure story without resorting to the tedious ingredients of guns, cars, explosions, terrorists, FBI/CIA & Co. and billions of dollars.	2005-09-20

He arrives in Benares, \\"the Oxford of the East\\", where he hopes to study and spend his time with his favourite books. He is a shy young man who does not enjoy the casual display of personality at social gatherings. The superficial amiability and the light chatter make him feel uncomfortable and he doesn't enjoy taking part in conversations, afraid to say the wrong thing and not quite sure what the right thing to say is. He grew up alone and therefore developed no skills for intimacy or even friendship which he feels requires a degree of self-abnegation from him. <br />However after meeting several characters like Miss West, Rajesh - a fellow student who turns out to be a criminal - and Catherine, Samar slowly realises that socialising allows him to discover a whole new world. It is particularly his love affair with Catherine which he experiences as a strong emotional turmoil. It is understandable since Samar grew up in a culture where men and women are ushered into marriage after parents have convinced each other about their respective social and financial status. Love is supposed to follow marriage and not the other way round and it doesn't matter much if it doesn't... <br />An interesting tale of a young provincial man who struggles to make sense of a strange and alien cosmopolitan world. The descriptions of Pondicherry, Allahabad, Benares, Dharamshala and the Himalayas are lyrical and the reader is constantly reminded of the bewitching power of India. <br />	2005-09-08

But then his seventeen year old student Chris Wiley starts writing a novel about Mary Queen of Scots entitled \\"Who Killed Darnley\\" and Rowland suffers from writing block because he is jealous of the ease with which Chris's writing progresses. Rowland can't understand why his teenage pupil is able to write like a professional, how he can manage language so wonderfully and with so little experience. Nothing compared with his own dismal efforts at mediocre prose. <br />But as the reader progresses along the plot, he realises that nothing in Mrs Spark's novel is as it seems. The characters are well drawn, the scenes are often very amusing because they are laced with acute and witty observations about authors, publishers, school life, marital relationships and more generally about present day preoccupations. <br />	2005-09-08

There is Angelo himself, Cavallero, Zarlingo, Benedetti, Antrilli, Mascarini and Nicholas. During their meetings, they gamble, brawl and of course drink heavily. Nicholas Molise and his wife Maria brought up four children now in their fifties, Mario, Virgil, Stella and Henry, the latter being the narrator in Mr Fante's both tragic and funny tale. Nicholas is now 76 and he used to work as a contractor and he built many imposing buildings in San Elmo. A passionate man of Italian origin, the head of the family is described by Henry as \\"a judge, jury and executioner, Jehovah himself\\". He scorns his sons because, to his bitter disappointment, none of them became a stonemason. And now Nick pesters Henry to join him in an absurd project of building of a smokehouse up in the Sierra mountains... <br />It is both the funny and sad tale of a son watching his father age, wait, mark time and become increasingly lonelier. But there is anger too in Henry's memories when he remembers his father's ignorance, he who kept books out of Henry's range, despised them, ignored them. His ranting, threats, greed, bullying and gambling are hard to forget. Henry can't but despise his father's old bones and skin, his wine-soaked oldness, his sinful and sodden friends. He can barely contain his anger at being trapped on an absurd safari into the mountains because of his father's vanity, to prove himself he is still \\"a hotshot stonemason\\". Yet Henry is finally the only son who stands by his father's side as his final moment approaches... <br />The novel is brimming with love, violence, death, religion and also plenty of humour because the author's prose is honest, evocative and intimate.	2005-08-24

Unfortunately since then he became the Stockholm Syndicate's target. One night Henderson and Beaurain together with 20 armed men were watching suspicious movements in a building in the rue des Bouchers when suddenly an assassin appeared out of nowhere with his Luger pointing at Beaurain. The latter could shoot at him with a gas pistol and then Henderson and his men neutralised him and took him away in their van. <br />But then a series of questions had to be posed. Why did the Syndicate send a Russian called Serge Litov to do the killing? Was the dark-haired woman Beaurain had spotted in the window of the Auberge des Roses next to the scene of the shooting a watcher safely placed there by the Syndicate? Knowing that Beaurain had escaped the killing, what would the Syndicate's next step be? And how would Telescope counter their next attack? Or could it be that the Syndicate's plan was not to kill Beaurain but, far worse, to have Litov infiltrate Telescope and locate its main base at Chteau Wardin...?	2005-08-16

He has been appointed by superintendent Jack Straffen and is going to work together with psychiatrists John Archer and Peter Cleave, the latter being the narrator of the ensuing events. Max is accompanied by his wife Stella and his son Charlie. <br />But soon Stella comes to despise the claustrophobic atmosphere of the mental institution and her husband Max - it was a cold and white marriage - who has a weak sexual drive and lacks the moral and physical imagination to continue to find Stella attractive and who channels his libido into his work. <br />It is therefore understandable that after meeting one of Peter's patients, a sculptor called Edgar Stark, she feel irresistibly attracted by his strong manliness. <br />But Edgar is a delusional patient who killed his wife Ruth, then cut her head and mutilated her. This was the result of an unconscious process and the product of the delusional structure of his mind to suppose his wife's infidelity. Edgar structured his sculpting around Ruth until the idealisation of her person collapsed and he developed morbid delusions about her infidelity. <br />One day Edgar manages to steal some of Max's clothes and absconds to London. When Peter notices that Stella has secretly visited Edgar several times in London, he tries to warn her about the dangers such a situation is bound to present, but to no avail. Stella decides to join Edgar and flees her family thus placing her life into the hands of a dangerous criminal. <br />The narrative structure of the novel is particularly original since it combines both events which unfold chronologically and a retrospective account or confession to Peter of Stella's relationship with Edgar. The narrative is superb and unruffled and the slowly shocking descent into the tormented depths of madness is a brilliant achievement. Few authors have shown with such elegance and restraint the extremes of mental derangement.	2005-08-16

During these six days - they seem like the days of the Creation indeed - Conor retraces his father's epic life from his early childhood after the first World War when he was just a bundle of abandoned skin and rescued by two Protestant ladies who raised him. Later, when the ladies died, Michael sold their property and developed a strong passion for photography. He sold his prints to various newspapers. In 1939 he went to Madrid and subsequently to Mexico where he married Juanita. Obsessed with the beauty of her body, Michael took hundreds of pictures of her in various stages of nudity. These photos became a strong point of discord between them in later years and they're the probable cause for Juanita's vanishing 11 years before Conor's account. After that they moved to California, Wyoming and New York before finally returning back to Ireland. <br />It is the impressive tale of a son retracing his parents' long journey in order to try to find his mother again. It is also the story of a son witnessing the physical decay of his old father rotting in his own dirt and whose sole preoccupation in old age is fishing. A formidable novel by the best contemporary Irish novelist.	2005-08-16

It is a fairly complex tale involving many protagonists and what is interesting is that the plot revolves around the Amerindian mythology of the brother-sister incest, in this case involving two characters called Beatrice and Danny McKinnon. <br />The myth concerns the eclipse which represents brother-and-sister incest in the form of a copulating sun and moon and it is widespread throughout the Americas, from the Bering Straight in the North to the southern parts of Brazil. People believe that a brother came secretly to his sister at nights. She enjoyed this but, not knowing who he was, painted his face in black with some genipap plant to identify him. In his shame, the brother rose to the sky and became the moon which explains why the moon has dark patches on its face. Other events are interesting in the novel: Father Napier's pathetic attempt at converting the Rupununi district to Christianity and his subsequent failure and descent into madness, the existence of Beatrice's son Sonny and his tragic disappearance and also Beatrice's threat uttered to her sister Wifreda during an eclipse to make her blind. An impressive first novel well worth reading. <br />	2005-08-16

Her first son Sean drowned in a ditch when he was 3 and her second son, Martin, left to live in Dublin. He was forced to lave Monaghan after having admitted to his father that he was homosexual, a fact his father couldn't admit since \\"the animals in the fields don't even do that\\". Finally Grace can't take the violence anymore and runs over Michael with her car one night as he is coming back home, drunk. <br />After her crime, Grace joins her son Martin in Dublin but she soon understands that it is difficult for her to come to terms with her son's way of life and she can't help feeling out of place, bored and tired of staying in the house Martin shares with his boyfriend Henry. Furthermore there is neither escape nor redemption to be found in Dublin for the crime she committed. <br />An altogether interesting first novel with an original plot structure although perhaps a bit lengthy at times. Certainly Grace's psychological instability in a life which became devoid of meaning after Michael's death and her son's difficulty in trying to comprehend her behaviour in Dublin are the strong points in Mr Ridgway's novel.	2005-08-13

Caroline was sent to a convent school in Milan and Matteo to a school in Turin which had been recommended by his uncle. However Matteo performed very poorly: he was bad at maths, could not sing and played football in a disastrous way so that he was constantly bullied by his classmates. Finally his parents decided to take him back home and they found a tutor, Fabian, for his education. But he remained a rebellious student, learning nothing, eating nothing. Whenever his father talked to him about a career in banking or in the family silk business, Matteo would simply smile faintly. Finally in the summer of 1975, he married Sophie, the daughter of a German banker and together they left for India taking with them Matteo's much beloved copy of Hermann Hesse's \\"The Journey to the East\\". <br />In Bombay they met Pierre Eduard who took them to an elderly woman who performed a few tricks as a form of worship to the glory of Shiva. Whilst Sophie remained unimpressed with what she called \\"party tricks\\", Matteo on the other hand was quite transfixed by what he had seen. Later they met Mr Pandey, a \\"deus ex machina\\" as Sophie called him in her exasperation, who suggested that they go and live in an ashram. After that Matteo came up with the idea that they replicate the journey which a famous saint had undertaken on foot to a shrine where he obtained enlightenment. But Sophie could not share Matteo's enthusiasm about searching for \\"the mystery that is the heart of India\\" during the exhausting expedition and even after such a short time spent in the country, she had no doubt that it was a culture to which she would never belong. Matteo on the other hand was literally seized by madness with his quest for the \\"devine light\\" despite the warnings that \\"the gods are destructive in this country\\". Will Matteo's studying with a swami at a distant ashram help him recover his senses? Will Matteo and Sophie go through this adventure togetherand recover their love? <br />Mrs Desai shows hard and driven people in her novel, the mutual contempt of a wife and a husband, the rejection foreigners may experience in India and also a man deluding himself in an impossible quest. Perhaps the author's other novels like \\"Baumgartner's Bombay\\" or \\"In Custody\\" are more accessible, less obscure.	2005-08-13

There is Joseph Hamilton, a rather plump boy of unsubtle features and of nervous composure. Scott Berry, a shy brown-eyed boy. Raoul Dean, slim and indifferent. Although the three boys were raised in different social backgrounds, they used to spend a great deal of time together. Their deviant behaviour started with small theft, breaking shop windows and resisting their parents' authority. That is why they were convicted by a children's court to stay at Bleda Reformatory until the age of 18. But to Mr Hull's great disappointment it soon transpires that the three boys are unwilling to settle into the quiet and reverential attitude which is expected of the residents at Blenda. <br />A harrowing account of three teenaged boys growing up in violence, resentment and vengeance, their life completely devoid of peace, joy and contentment. Once again, a South African author shows us that life in that part of the world is more a matter of survival than of living. Mr Galgut's achievement can easily be compared to some of his compatriots like Andr Brink, Nadine Gordimer or J. M. Coetzee.	2005-08-13

As her sister Charlotte sated, this personal experience lies behind many of the characters and events as well as Agnes's feelings in the novel. <br />As a first novel, it show an astonishing maturity and technical accomplishment since \\"Agnes Grey\\" is in many ways a very personal story. Mrs Bront describes as vividly as possible the strong pressures that a governess' life involved at that time - the isolation, the frustrations, the insensitive treatment of employers and their families. Actually it transpires in this novel that middle-class households used to consider a governess as little more than a servant thus undervaluing her role as an educator. And the author's view of such households is sharply cynical: they are self-satisfied, vulgar, small-minded snobs who delight in social pretension. They are mercilessly depicted in their moral emptiness and Agnes actually suffers from moral isolation which becomes more and more oppressive and alienating, especially during her stay with the Murrays. In this family Agnes feel deprived from ordinary human kindness and warmth of affection so much so that she falls into depression because she feels that her moral identity is being destroyed, no longer confident in her \\"distinctions of right and wrong\\". <br />A remarkable novel about a young woman and such issues as moral behaviour, moral responsibility and individual integrity.	2005-08-13

And indeed readers will discover some harrowing facts about the way the industry processes our everyday food. If you don't know what mechanically recovered meat is, how chickens are raised in Brazil, that when you order chicken in a restaurant you may in fact be eating 30% beef, that a farm is no longer a place where food is grown but an industrial complex of packing sheds around lorry parks or that the conditions under which illegal immigrants pick fruit and vegetables in Spain can be compared to \\"South African apartheid\\". The author visited a giant refrigerated packing plant near Aylesford which reminded her of Fritz Lang's \\"Metropolis\\"! Did you know that a standard shopping basket in a supermarket with 20 fresh foods represents an average accumulation of 100 000 \\"food miles\\"? One example: the mangetout or asparagus from Peru you buy have a journey of 6312 miles behind them... Or that 60% of the factory bread consumed in Britain is produced by plants belonging to two giants - who call themselves \\"bakeries\\" - British Bakeries and Allied Bakeries? <br />Well Mrs Lawrence has plenty of examples in store in her study which will surprise many a reader about the way our modern food is manufactured and processed.

Mrs Curren, a professor of classics in Cape Town, has just received the fatal news from her doctor, Dr Syfert, that she suffers from an incurable form of cancer. Part of the narrative consists in an imaginary letter Mrs Curren will never write to her daughter who left for America in 1976. Indeed she does not consider it to be just to share her burden with her daughter but, as she puts it, \\"to resist the craving to share my death\\", \\"to take my leave without bitterness\\" and \\"to embrace death as my own, mine alone.\\" But since it is nearly impossible for her to approach death without the support of another human being, she ends up sharing her thoughts and life with Mr Vercueil, a tramp she finds one morning sleeping in the garden of her house. <br />Death is omnipresent in Mr Coetzee's work, not only Mrs Curren's but in the townships of Cape Town where the lives of the coloureds are worth next to nothing and therefore death is as common as life for the people obliged to live there. A powerful, sad and unforgettable tale whose characters and events cut to the bone.	2005-08-12

People claim that there is a certain resemblance with Virginia Woolf in her features. At any rate her novels are published under the pen-name of Vanessa Wilde and they bear such titles as \\"The Sun at Midnight\\", \\"Beneath the Visiting Mood\\" or \\"The Stone and the Star\\". Edith doesn't seem to hold writing in high esteem. She describes this activity more like a compulsion: \\"she bent her head obediently to her daily task of fantasy and obfuscation\\", enjoying a rest \\"after her obscure and unnoticeable exertions\\". In fact she even considers reading as a kind of cure for the psychologically diseased: \\"Fiction, the time honoured resource of the ill-at-ease...\\" <br />After settling down at the Hotel du Lac - set in a small village on the Swiss shore of lake Geneva - Edith meets her extravagant fellow lodgers: Iris Pusey and her daughter Jennifer, Mme de Bonneuil and Monica accompanied by her insufferable dog Kiki. During her numerous discussions with these women, Edith starts reflecting on the life she has led so far and on love in general. The reader also learns about her past and her troubled relationship with her mother. And it is not before the end of the novel that we discover why Edith came to the Hotel du Lac, why she left London in such a haste and what exactly the \\"unfortunate lapse\\" was which brought her to her temporary exile in Switzerland. <br />Like one critic said about \\"Hotel du Lac\\": \\"Novels like Anita Brookner's are why we read novels\\".	2005-08-08

The work impresses so much because it is a portrayal with extraordinary vitality and thoughtfulness of its characters. One feels that only the author's personal experiences can lend the story its sense of authenticity. As a result of the violation of Soviet legality, people were put to camps and had to undergo severe physical and moral tests under extreme circumstances. That's why Shukhov's \\"ordinary\\" day arouses in the reader the feeling of pain for the fate of the people who rise up before us so vivid and so near. Yet the author's unique skill lies in the fact that the bitterness and pain are not rendered by a feeling of hopeless depression but by the profound humanity and solidarity of the inmates. The author shows that even in such a grim place as a Soviet camp there is room for humour, hope and feelings. Finally Solzhenitsyn being a first class stylist, his novel is written in the colourful and lively language in which folk metaphors are mixed with camp jargon.	2005-06-30

He has to look after his younger sisters, Jody, Misty and Amber, because their mother is serving a life sentence in prison since she killed their father. He works at a Shop Rite with two incompetent work mates, Bud and Church, under the command of the useless boss Rick. And he has a second part-time job at Barklay's Appliances. Their house is a permanent chaos and it is very difficult for Harley to make both ends meet. He is assigned a social worker and a psychoanalyst whom he both loathes. But he has no choice since he doesn't want his sisters to be officially declared orphans and be sent to foster families. <br />The strength of this novel is the fact that the events are seen through Harley's young mind. He is often confused because he is not mature enough to have two jobs and educate his younger sisters at the same time. They in turn consider him more as a brother than a father and as a result there are frequent rows between them, especially between Harley and the elder girl Amber who strives for independence. But Harley is very much concerned by the well being of the girls and his worries even once make him have a hallucinatory vision of finding them dead at home, piled up in a pool of blood. <br />At the same time he is looking for a girlfriend and wonders if it is possible to love someone without getting personally involved, without any mutual feeling or judgement. His first relationship is a confused one with a neighbour, Callie Mercer, wife of a bank manager and mother of two children. And Harley often recalls his father and how he used to ill treat his children. <br />His struggle in life is all the more impressive since he gets no support at all from any adult, not even his uncle Mike.	2005-06-30

It is well known however that these events took place under Presiedent Calles, elected in 1924, and the infamous atheist Governor of Tabasco, Garrido Canabal. <br />The central figure of the novel is a nameless priest, a so-called \\"whisky priest\\" since this spirit was used during illegal Masses due to the lack of wine. Furthermore, the name attests for a drinking habit with most illegal priests in this tropical, crooked and anti-clerical part of Mexico. The story-line is a succession of harrowing scenes as the haunted priest tries to keep conducting his Masses but the most ironical and corrosive scene is the one in which he must watch a half-caste mestizo, a fiercely anti-clerical lieutenant and a corrupt chief of police drink up a bottle of wine he had bought with his last money for sacramental use. <br />Graham Greene's sympathy with the poor in spirit and the world's losers is obvious. The whisky priest's descent into illegality and darkness and his simultaneous ascent in martyrdom are spectacular because they so dominate the plot - all other characters have an insignificant importance except that of the lieutenant. The priest's existence seems particularly dogged and doomed not only because of the illegality of his clerical activities but also because he is an alcoholic and has an illegitimate daughter. But clearly the author distinguishes between man and function and this also applies to Father Jos, a debased priest compelled by the authorities and his own cowardice to marry - a figure of ridicule even to the children of the town. <br />Finally it is worth mentioning the author's brilliantly built and abrupt scenes and artfully lit images which have a cinematic touch of surreal reminiscent of pictures by Luis Bunuel.	2005-06-23

He has narrow shoulders and surprisingly wide hips and because he inherited bad hip joints, he moves about with a hideous swing as if he wants to shake off something on his back. His skin is scarred with acne, his eyes deep-set and strange, often downcast, avoiding other people's glance. He wears filthy, smelly and disgusting clothes and the words on his T-shirt read \\"Kill The Others\\". <br />He sees the world through a sort of murky veil, always afraid that others are after him, that every single person is his enemy and that is why he has no friends at all and hardly talks to anyone. He often conducts imaginary inner dialogues with a hallucinatory figure called \\"Nestor\\". Most people find him so repulsive that they compare him with an animal, finding that his eyes resemble those of a dog or that he runs like a hare. <br />One day, a boy called Kannick Snellingen finds the dead body of Haldis Horn lying on the steps of her small farm in Finnemarka. He also reports to the police that he has seen Errki Johrma in the woods not far from the farm. And indeed Inspector Sejer soon finds out that Errki has been missing from the asylum for some time... <br />Mrs Fossum designed a clever plot in this mystery story and her portrayal of the schizophrenic mind will indeed regale readers interested in psychology in the same manner as Ruth Rendell's books do.	2005-06-22

He doesn't devote much time talking about his criminal activities in his home country apart from stating that he used to rob banks and deal in drugs and then chose to abandon his wife and children for the life of a fugitive. Upon his arrival in the Indian capital, he met Prabaker Kharre, a loveable character who showed him round the city, particularly the areas rarely visited by mainstream tourists. At Leopold's, a bar where illegal business is conducted by many Indians and a few foreigners, the narrator was introduced to Karla Saaranen, a beautiful woman who is often the object of his thoughts throughout the novel due to the difficulty she has in feeling love for anyone. <br />As he settled down in Bombay, he learned to speak Marathi and Hindi and during the adventurous years he spent in the city he became acquainted with a whole array of characters and he became to be known as Lin, Linbaba or Shantaram. The most impressive passages in the novel are the narrator's visit to Prabaker's native village of Sunder, his work in the zhopadpatti slum, his experience with the monsoon and the cholera, his work for Abdel Khader Khan and the Bombay Mafia, his stays at the Arthur Road Prison and the Colaba lock-up and finally his fight for the mujaheddin cause in the mountains of Afghanistan. <br />Mr Roberts wonderfully shows both the generosity and the violence of the Indian people's character.

But a row occurs between Pierre and Nathalie because the former considers that Louis is allowed to consume too many sweets. Subsequently, Pierre accuses Nathalie of badly educating their son and menaces to take him to Paris to his mother's. The boy runs away and is chased by his father when he suddenly falls into a ravine. With the help of the gendarmes, Louis is found dead and there is no trace of his father. Two hours later the boy and his distraught mother are brought to Vichy General Hospital, Louis miraculously comes back to life but remains comatose in Dr Philippe Meunier's ward. After that he is transferred to the Clinique de l'Horizon in Provence and placed in the hands of neurologist Dr Pascal Dannachet who specialises in PVS patients (Persistent Vegetative State). <br />Soon Pascal is puzzled by the circumstances of Louis's accident. Not only because his mother is the only witness but also because she now claims that Louis didn't fall into the ravine but was pushed by his father, an alcoholic pilot with Air France. Then two menacing letters are sent to both Nathalie and Pierre in a childish handwriting and signed \\"Louis\\". How could a comatose child write these letters, let alone post them? Is it a trick played by his father Pierre? But this possibility is soon ruled out when Pierre's body is found by a group of speleologists in a cave not far from Louis's accident. <br />A fine mystery story in which Mrs Jensen shows that a mother's feelings for her son can be ambivalent, swaying between love and hatred, perhaps because a son is never quite like a mother wishes him to be.	2005-06-08

He suffers from hallucinations - visual, auditory and olfactory - and from body delusions, he is physically regressed and has ideas of persecution. At the beginning of the novel, set in 1957, he lives in a shabby house along with other tenants, a \\"cargo of dead souls\\" as he calls the place, the landlady of which is a matronly figure, Mrs Wilkinson, who terrifies Cleg. As the story unfolds, the reader gets to know the circumstances which brought Cleg to live in this grimy place where \\"desolation prevails\\", in an area of London resembling \\"a clotted web of dark compartments.\\" He feels that he would relish his solitude and memories were he not so easily thrown into turmoil by the latter. His existence is loveless, monotonous and grey as he often drifts further and further into the back parts of his mind where the reader follows him and tries to discern reality from delusion. A man like Cleg constantly lives in isolation, he has no friends, doesn't want any, doesn't like any. How could he, being permanently nagged by the certainty that others can destroy him with just a glance? From early childhood, being seen created in Cleg a deep sense of unease and he recalls imagining being \\"a coal-black boy who could move through darkness without being seen.\\" Even years later \\"the misting and blurring of the visible world gave such comfort to the boy, and to the creature I have since become.\\" Another reason for Cleg avoiding people is the frightening prospect of their thoughts invading his mind. \\"If I'm not careful these thought patterns of theirs crowd out my own, and I can't have that, I can't have other people's thoughts in my head.\\" <br />Apart from a brilliant psychological portrait of the schizophrenic mind, \\"Spider\\" is designed almost like a detective story in which the reader slowly discovers what happened to Cleg in his childhood, the time he spent in a mental institution and the subsequent years at Mrs Wilkinson's house. Highly recommended.	2005-06-07

The novel opens when the Bourbon sates of Naples and Sicily, called the kingdom of the Tow Sicilies, is about to end and the Italian peninsula is to become one state again for the first time since the fall of the Roman Empire. The first chapter is set in May 1860 precisely when Garibaldi arrives in Sicily from Genoa. The \\"Garibaldini\\" land in Marsala and within two weeks occupy the capital, Palermo. Gathering more volunteers, Garibaldi crosses to the mainland and defeats the Bourbon troops on the Volturno. Subsequently Garibaldi hands over southern Italy to King Victor Emmanuel and every state in the peninsula agrees to join the new united kingdom via plebiscites. Finally the revolutionary actions of the Risorgimento - the movement for unification - are ended by the Italian government troops and Rome is declared as capital of Italy in 1870.<br /><br />It is against this historical background that the reader follows the life of Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina, a Sicilian aristocrat who watches impassively the ruin of his own class and his own inheritance. He is no less abated by the decline of his own prestige than the numerous prancing bewhiskered stone leopards adorning his palaces. One follows his worries about daughters, dowries, political careers and religious intrigues. He submits to endless little subterfuges, he the leopard who used to sweep away effortlessly difficulties with the wave of his paw. Don Fabrizio is surrounded by a multitude of hilariously grotesque characters with whom the author casts an amused but bitter glance at the Sicilian mentality. \\"The Sicilians never want to improve for the simple reason that they think themselves perfect; their vanity is stronger than their misery; every invasion by outsiders, whether so by origin, if Sicilian, by independence of spirit, upsets their illusion of achieved perfection, risks disturbing their satisfied waiting for nothing; having been trampled on by a dozen different peoples, they consider they have an imperial past which gives them a right to a grand funeral.\\"<br /><br />Giuseppe di Lampedusa painstakingly meditated for twenty-five years over his novel.

At that establishment, it is the tradition that one pupil should be granted a private audience with a visiting author provided that a piece of his or her own work wins the competition. The winner is chosen by the author and the pupil's work is then published in the school newspaper. When the visit of Ernest Hemingway is announced, Lambert struggles along with his competitors George Kellog, Bill White and Jeff Purcell to win the honour of meeting the famous writer in private. Unfortunately Lambert chooses a not quite honest way of winning the competition which results in his being expelled from school. <br />Apart from the plot which magnificently describes life at school at that time, Mr Wolff poses interesting questions. What is an author? How does the desire to create arise? How many of those who have literary ambitions will eventually succeed? How can an aspiring writer fight the writer's block? The author also shows that the topics of truth and fiction and of honesty and delusion are  slippery ones. One wonders indeed if it is possible to tell the truth in writing and if, in art in general, there is any truth at all. In this sense, the main character in \\"Old School\\" is perhaps not Lambert but literature itself. One quality this novel certainly possesses is stylistic restraint with every sentence having a rare and high precision.	2005-05-25

Laing, 1) (Volume 3)	Books	5	53	54	N	N	An existential approach to the conception of the self	In this valuable study, Dr Laing proposes to examine the way some individuals are very proficient in acquiring a false self in order to adapt to false realities and to give an account of specifically personal forms of depersonalisation and disintegration. It is no small task for the therapist to articulate what the patient's \\"world\\" is and his way of being in it in order to outline his psychopathology. The author states that if we look at his actions as signs of a disease, we impose categories of thoughts on the patient in our effort to try to explain his mental state and it isn't easy for the therapist to transpose himself into the patient's strange and alien view of world in order to understand his existential position. <br />Dr Laing states that many patients suffer from \\"ontological insecurity\\" because they feel insubstantial, the ordinary circumstances of life constituting a continual threat to their own existence. He mentions personalities like Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett and Francis Bacon. Then Dr Laing proceeds by giving the account of three forms of anxiety encountered by the ontologically insecure subject: engulfment, implosion and petrification. To illustrate these three forms, the author describes the case of Mrs R. who suffered from agoraphobia and schizohphrenic withdrawal. <br />Interestingly enough, the schizoid individual constantly feels vulnerable as he is exposed by the look of another person and that is why he fears live dialectical relationships with live people and prefers to relate himself to depersonalised persons or to phantoms of his own fantasies, thus the distinction between the \\"embodied\\" and \\"unembodied\\" self. Such an individual is afraid of the world, frightened that any impingement will be total and engulfing. He is afraid of letting himself \\"go\\", of coming out of himself or of losing himself because he feels that he will be depleted, exhausted, emptied, robbed or sucked dry. So for the schizoid individual, direct participation in life is felt as being at a risk of being destroyed by life. One aspect of this individual's ontological insecurity is the precariousness of his subjective sense of his own aliveness and the sense that others threaten this tentative feeling. The schizoid individual strongly believes in his own destructiveness by others. This view is in accord to the existentialist's philosophy represented by Jean-Paul Sartre who stated in his famous theatre play \\"Huis Clos\\" that \\"L'enfer, c'est les autres.\\" <br />Thus a false self can arise in the individual which is in compliance with the intentions and expectations of the other or with what are imagined to be the other's intentions or expectations. Indeed, the self-conscious person feels he is more the object of other people's interest than in fact he is. And so the schizoid individual carries out defences like being like everyone else, being someone other than oneself, playing a part, being nobody or being incognito and anonymous. So if the gaze of others is experienced as a threat, there is a constant dread and resentment at being turned into someone else's thing (what Sartre called \\"l'tre-pour-autrui\\"), of being penetrated by him, and a sense of being in someone else's power and control. Freedom then consists in being inaccessible. Love too for schizoid individuals is viewed as disguised persecution since it aims to turn him into an object of the other. <br />This type of individual can be himself in safety only in isolation. With others he plays an elaborate game of pretence and his social life is felt to be false and futile. But the more he keeps his \\"true self\\" concealed and unseen, the more he presents to others a false front and the more compulsive this fake presentation of himself becomes. This can lead to a complete disintegration of the personality.	2005-05-18

Amina's body now withered, her hair white, ill health and grief having altered her considerably. Her diligence and her capacity for running the household are now gone. She no longer pays attention to her home except for the services to her husband al-Sayyid Ahmad, once a vigorous man in full swing. He now suffers from high blood pressure and he had to give up many of the pleasures of life - drinks, women and good food. In fact, many months before dying, he is completely bedridden, a particularly humiliating situation for a man with such a strong ego. <br />Here Mr Mahfouz casts a compassionate glance at the irony of life which makes elderly people become utterly dependant on others, as they used to be when they were infants. For Kamal, now thirty-six, it is sad to see his family age, all the more since he refuses to get married and thus spends a lot of time aloof and lonely. Aiming at becoming a true intellectual, Kamal often collides with doubt and struggles with instincts and passions and is becoming \\"an emotionally crippled recluse\\". He often broods about his youth, his love for Ada and the eternal loss of the enchanting past. <br />But there are also reasons to rejoice as the younger generation takes over and ascends in society. Marriages take place, careers are planned. Mr Mahfouz splendidly portrays this cycle of life in which the old generation gives way to the boisterous and cheerful young one. This is shown in the moving final scene when Kamal and his brother Yasin enter a store where the former buys several items for his daughter's baby while the latter buys a black necktie he will need when the mournful day of his mother's death arrives...	2005-05-11

After more than one year, Al-Sayyid Ahmad resumes his visits to Jalila and Zubayda. The later is to become his private mistress on a houseboat on the Nile and later Yasin's wife! Kamal is now seventeen and to Al-Sayyid Ahmad's disappointment he intends to enrol at the Teachers College. His father would wish him to become a civil servant or an engineer but Kamal is more interested in literature and philosophy. He is indeed becoming an adult and his relation with his mother Amina is changing. He feels that he has nothing much to tell her except \\"meaningless chatter\\". Another disappointment for Kamal is his love for Ada who never quite reciprocates his feelings for her. <br />What makes the second volume interesting is the evolution of the Egyptian society, the rules of which begin to relax as the country inexorably adopts more Western values. These values are difficult to accept for conservative people like those of Al-Sayyid Ahmad's generation. It appears that the family values suffer most from such a modernisation and in this respect Yasin is a good example with his three marriages. Like in the first volume, the reader can expect the highest literary standards in \\"Palace Of Desire\\" by one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. <br />	2005-05-09

As Dr. Trotter recounts the events which lead to his being sentenced, one becomes aware of how deeply a patient can become involved both with his therapy and his therapist - it is no exaggeration to use the word obsession - so that the analyst is elevated to the figure of a deity and is blindly worshiped by the analysand. <br />Then Dr Yalom introduces a set of characters whose paths cross at one point or another in the novel as the very skilfully woven plot unfolds. There is Justin who's been trapped in an impossible marriage for years and decides one day, out of the blue, to leave his wife Carol for another woman, having unexpectedly regained his self-confidence. Carol on her part holds Dr. Ernest Lash responsible for Justin's transformation and she decides to take revenge and to become Ernest's patient in order to seduce him and then to sue him for malpractice. But Ernest remains indomitable and Carolyn's - alias Carol's - vain sexual advances give rise to hilarious scenes. <br />Dr Marshal Streider, Ernest's supervisor, helps to cure Shelly Merriman who can't prevent revealing his hand of cards on his face.

His physical condition is mirrored in Constance's emotional paralysis. When she meets the gamekeeper Mellors, she finds refuge in his arms and feels regenerated. Together they shield themselves from the chaos of the outer world and move to the sanctum of the inner world of fulfilment. <br />The character of Constance is an interesting one because there is a certain complexity in her: she is both in touch with nature, yet educated; sensitive, yet wise; female in her sensitivity, yet almost male in her strength and attitude. She is a woman with a social position who is drawn to an outsider of a lower class. The structure of the novel is also interesting because it shows three stages in Constance's relationship with her husband and Mellors. In the first phase, she denies her husband, responding to a failed marriage, she finds refuge with Mellors. Then begins the second stage when Constance regenerates in the peaceful world of her lover's hut. Finally in the third stage, she escapes the world of Wragby Hall as she leaves for a holiday to Venice. There she takes the resolution never to return to Clifford's world. This resolution is taken all the more easily by Constance because being away from Wragby Hall she can reconsider her commitment to Mellors while their relationship is gradually exposed as a scandal which really prevents her from returning to her husband. Then the novel's central struggle shifts from that between a Lady and a gamekeeper to that between Constance's and Mellor's commitment to each other and the forces hostile to their relationship. <br />Constance's transformations occur in an set of tensions and an artistic dualism: tenderness against apathy, nature against culture, wood against stone, flesh against intellect, frankness against manipulation or fertility againststerility. These tensions strongly mark the first phase of the novel where Wragby Hall symbolises sterility and spiritual and emotional apathy, will and intellectual control; the hut symbolises the free play of the instinct and sensual pleasure, the haven of tenderness. The two worlds cannot interact: Clifford intrudes into nature with his mechanical wheelchair as much as Mellors is an intruder and outsider inside Wragby Hall. Perhaps the most striking opposition is that between silence and talk. As Constance and Mellors retreat into the sheltered world of the hut, the author insists on the stillness and the silence of the place, focuses on the internal and emotional feelings since both characters are fugitives from \\"the outer world of chaos.\\" That's why enclosures are so present in the novel: the hut, the clearing, the cottage, an enclosed yard, a bedroom, as many shelters from psychological suffering. Mellors is \\"afraid of society\\" whereas Constance recoils from the \\"insanity of the whole civilised species.\\" They both linger in pure silence, even anonymity since they hardly ever call each other by name. <br />D.H. Lawrence's critics have deplored the numerous love making scenes in which Constance and Mellors induldge and which are described in a surprisingly open language, considering the epoch in which the novel was published. But these scenes show how Constance is \\"reborn\\", how sex is the act that most completely unites a man and a woman and its power of renewal is attuned to day, season or year - it is in this novel the most regenerative experience possible. There is indeed strong hope that John Thomas will be reunited with lady Jane in the future! In this sense, \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" ranks among the 20th century most extraordinary achievements.	2005-04-28

The novel opens with the birth of Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli's son in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1968. Then the author relates in detail how Ashoke and Ashima marry in Calcutta without having met even once before. After the wedding, Ashoke is offered a position as a doctoral candidate in electrical engineering at MIT and moves to Cambridge, followed some time later by his wife Ashima. Since it is the tradition in Bengal that the grandmother determines her grandson's Christian name, she sends a letter from Calcuta to Cambridge but the letter never arrives and so the reader learns how the main character in the novel comes to bear the name of Gogol. <br />It is interesting to see how the first generation emigrants feel completely out of place in their new environment, constantly longing to return to their country. But as their children grow up, they gradually adapt to American customs, startled by the fact that their offspring feel much closer to the culture they are being brought up in rather that to their parents' original civilisation. After Ashoke's death, more than thirty years later, as Ashima is about to sell her house and return to Calcutta, her conception of \\"home\\" has naturally shifted and she actually feels like going to a foreign place. <br />A moving first novel in which Mrs Lahiri describes in a compassionate, tender and human way a small family making the voyage between Asia and America.	2005-04-28

Curiously enough, Jessie's records and blood samples got lost in a fire when his doctor, Dr Buhler, had a car accident. Subsequently, Jessie was moved from Tucson Medical Centre to the Berne clinic in Thun, Switzerland, where patients are given a new chance at life thanks to a revolutionary formula called \\"cellular rejuvenation\\". Puzzled by such proceedings, Nancy and her British friend Bob Newman, a journalist, decide to travel to Thun to pay a visit to Professor Armand Grange, head of the Berne clinic, to persuade him to let them see and talk to Jessie. <br />To their astonishment, the clinic is guarded by uniformed armed men and Doberman watchdogs so that it resembles more a fortress than a hospital. Bob manages to distract Dr Novak's attention for a few minutes and Jessie confesses to Linda that a strange experiment is being carried out at the clinic and that some patients do not survive the experiment. <br />On their way back to Berne, Bob and Linda nearly crash into a snowplough which suddenly emerges from nowhere in front of their car.

Among the main topics, overpopulation of some parts of the world was a major concern for the author. The rapidly increasing number of people in relation to limited natural resources may lead to social instability and jeopardise the well being of individuals. There is a correlation between people multiplying too rapidly and the rise of totalitarian systems of government. Then the author discusses the issue of what should be undertaken with congenially or mentally insufficient organisms which are the result of unfavourable mutations. Should they be allowed to \\"contaminate\\" the genetic pool from which the members of our species will have to draw?<br /><br />Another problem of modern societies is the fact that the dehumanising effects of their over-organisation, especially in cities, may lead to a high incidence of schizophrenia. In \\"Brave New World\\" we see a society where people are never alone. This tendency can already be observed today as William Whyte rightly observes in \\"The Organisation Man\\". Concepts like \\"socially oriented behaviour, team work, group dynamics, acquisition of social skills\\" are very trendy nowadays.<br /><br />Other topics are discussed by Mr Huxley such as the concentration of communication-power in the hands of a few big concerns, the danger of people assembled in large crowds who then cease to have any judgement or will of their own - overwhelmed as they are by simplistic slogans - the question of children being conditioned by advertising from a very early age to buying specific products, the problems caused by widely available drugs such as \\"soma\\" and the effectiveness of subliminal projections and hypnopaedia.<br /><br />An altogether interesting read which allows a better understanding of Mr Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\".	2005-03-16

We readers rarely ask ourselves this question but in Mr Calvino's novel, even this simple assumption is questioned. The story is quite confusing indeed because nothing is as it appears. <br />But apart from the plot, Mr Calvino reflects on interesting topics which in my view save the book. For instance the reader's dilemma of choosing the appropriate novel among the thousand existing publications, the required ingredients to create suspense in a plot, the fact that books are easily defined entities which can be enjoyed without risks compared to the elusive quality of real-life existence, the pleasure of using a paper knife as the reader cuts his way through a novel or the problem posed by someone reading a text which may impose an undesirable pace on the listener. The author also casts a critical glance at universities as literary institutions which have forgotten that literature can be enjoyed in a natural, innocent and primitive way without having to be lacerated by intellectual analysis.	2005-03-16

In 1921, after living some time in New York and working as a waiter at the Waldorf-Astoria, he met the enormously wealthy press magnate William Randolph Hearst who offered him the position of butler at his extravagant castle in San Simeon, California. Although Heart is still married to his wife who lives on the East Coast with their five sons, he shares his life with Miss Davies, an ageing, depressed and alcoholic movie star. <br />As Kristjan undertakes to write numerous and never to be sent letters to his wife Elisabet in Iceland, the reader slowly discovers the man's tragic destiny. The contents of the letters partly explain the circumstances which lead Kristjan to marry Elisabet, to save her father's business and then to abandon both his shipping company and his family to flee to New York. What were his reasons? What did he seek in America and did he find what he was looking for? Why could Elisabet never find Kristjan despite her pathetic journey to New York with two of their four children? <br />Mr Olafsson masterfully depicts a desperate character who can never face the members of his family again because of the choices he made earlier in his life. It is interesting to compare \\"Walking Into The Night\\" with Kazuo Ishiguro's \\"The Remains Of The Day\\" because, although both novels convey a different atmosphere, they both show that certain vital decisions we take in our lives are irrevocable.	2005-03-10

Henry meets his septuagenarian Aunt Augusta for the first time at what he supposes to be his mother's funeral. She quickly persuades him to abandon his monotonous suburban life to join her and travel her way. And so they make their way first to Brighton and later to Paris, Istanbul and Paraguay. Through her aunt Henry gets acquainted with a twilight society, hippies, war criminals and CIA agents. He learns to smoke pot and to smuggle large amounts of money from one country to the next. <br />The character of Aunt Augusta is very witty indeed: she is wicked, selfish, wildly engaging, an old \\"belle de nuit\\" who likes men \\"who have a bit of the hound in them\\", a quality her nephew obviously lacks, which adds to her bewilderment. It is a feminine character, Aunt Augusta, who takes charge of the story, a rare fact for Mr Greene. She becomes a fierce, bossy and intrusive mother figure for Henry. Indeed he ends up by understanding and calling her \\"mother\\" a few lines before the end of the novel as he lays his head on his aunt's breast, feeling like a boy again who has run away from school and will never have to return. Finally Henry is completely transformed by his aunt and, at 50, begins to blossom. He sees her differently and acknowledges that she is not as wicked as he first considered her. In a prison cell in Paraguay, Henry notes: \\"I would certainly have called her career shady myself nine months ago and yet now there seemed nothing so very wrong in her curriculum vitae, nothing as wrong as 30 years in a bank.\\"	2005-03-09

In the 1970s, Olivia's step-granddaughter goes back to the heat and dust of Satipur to solve the mystery of the outrage caused by Olivia's flight. <br />Mrs Jhabvala's novel sounds like a warning. Both Olivia and the narrator do not seem to withstand India because they are fine and sensitive people who come to love the country very much, too much perhaps. Indeed there are many things to love in India: the landscapes, the history, the music and the physical beauty of men and women which may become a danger to the European. The characters in this novel are immersed by the Indian culture - and in Olivia's case, destroyed by it - they seem to be softened by an excess of feeling for India and finally they are dragged over to the other side. But according to Mrs Jhabvala's description of India - the smells, the sounds, the poverty, the filth, the beggars and cripples - it is difficult to imagine that Europeans can be as totally immersed in that culture as were both Olivia and the narrator.

He fits exactly the definition of a psychopathic person. He is asocial, self centred, impulsive and suffers from an acute anxiety nurosis. He has a strong need to preserve an immaculate ego, he is paranoiac, fears retribution and has an urgent need to be thought well by all people. And men like him cannot be reassured because their belief in their own worthlessness is so intense. Self-confidence cannot be implanted in Arthur anymore at the age of 50. That's why he fears other people - they represent a menace to his own integrity - and so he lives in private isolation. <br />Characteristically for a psychotic mind, Arthur is unable to form emotional relationships and he has no social ways of coping with his frustrations. This is certainly why Arthur keeps a plastic shop window model in his cellar. This model is dressed in his Auntie Gracie's clothes - for him she is the image of a mother, wife, counsellor, housekeeper and sole friend - which Arthur delights in \\"strangulating\\" regularly at night. <br />A very good thriller which shows that Mrs Rendell understands how a psychopathic mind works and how it can go awry.	2005-02-28

One day she gets a call from Ben Hoffman, a retired lawyer who used to be Sarah's professional mentor, asking her to come back to Smitrivier to take up a case. And so after fourteen years, Sarah returns to the town where she grew up to do Ben a favour because she thinks she owes him so much. A policeman, Pieter Muller, is suspected of having killed James Sizela's son Steve during the Apartheid. Muller's culpability has been a belief in Smitrivier for thirteen years, ever since Steve was arrested on Pieter Muller's orders and then disappeared. So now the Truth Commission is James's last chance to find his son's body and have him properly buried. The timing appears to be perfect since the Truth Commission is about to deal with the jailed policeman Dirk Hendricks who applied for amnesty for the torture of Alex Mpondo, now an MP in the South African government. The plan is to use Alex Mpondo's presence at the hearing to threaten Hendricks that unless he reveals Pieter Muller's complicity in the murder of Steve Sizela, he may not get his amnesty. But the search for the truth is going to be far more arduous than Sarah imagined - perhaps even an impossible task. <br />Mrs Slovo casts a merciless look at contemporary South Africa where heroism and perfidy are no longer distinct, where new truths are as painful as old lies, where torturers, once heroes, are now victims.

Actually he goes as far as claiming that reading is a biological necessity in the same way as eating is. Reading is thinking, imagining, understanding, feeling and healing. It is an activity that is far from an escape or an avoidance of reality because it provides the reader the necessary relief from the ad hoc reacting and chaos of socialising by taking care of us, leading us and letting us imagine alternative lives through the complex paths of experience and language. <br />In this sense reading truly is a therapeutic experience and Mr Gold gives numerous examples of patients he managed to cure by giving them novels to read because they are an experiential tool for re-seeing and reordering the reader's own confusing experience. Novels take on our confusion, they bear our burdens and leave us to see the larger picture we cannot see because they offer another perspective. <br />Reading being the most powerful and plentiful source of information, it isn't surprising that a vital element for the survival of any totalitarian regime is to take control of what people read because language is power. Authors like Aldus Huxley, George Orwell and above all Ray Bradbury have masterfully illustrated this point in their novels, the latter showing what happens to a civilisation in which television replaces literacy. People may still be able to read but they are what we may call \\"literary illiterates\\". <br />No doubt Mr Gold's message is clear: we have to read for the salvation of our spirit.	2005-02-28

Interestingly enough, an author like George Simenon stated that \\"Writing is not a profession but a vocation of unhappiness.\\" For some artists, creating is a wish-fulfilment like for Frederik Rolfe who was a psychopathic personality and a paranoid and who was also querulous, egocentric, suspicious and misanthropic. Or James Bond, the character who was a wish-fulfilling fantasy of what Ian Flemming would like to have been. The desire for fame and honour is also a part of an artist's motivation. Some artists attach such enormous importance to their work that it can be considered as an addiction in which the creative activity is sometimes used as a defence. Many artists show a schizoid character: they are introverted, solitary people, preoccupied with inner rather than outer reality because they feel weak and vulnerable vis--vis others. Dr Storr mentions Franz Kafka, Charles Dickens, Bertrand Russel and Albert Einstein. Indeed, it is the capacity for extreme abstraction combined with a retention of contact with reality which makes creative achievement of a high order so remarkable.  Had Isaac Newton not been anxious, insecure, hypochondriacal and self-disparaging with paranoid tendencies making him live in near total seclusion, he may never have achieved what he did. <br />Some artists have a manic-depressive temperament and the opportunity to express themselves through art enables them to do so without the immediate need to fit in with the opinions of others. The artistic creation is thus an effective method of protecting the self from depression. <br />Other artists like Rossini, Stravinski or Henrik Ibsen were obsessional characters - disgusted with bodily functions, parsimonious and miserly - so that their creative work was characterised by meticulous and extreme tidiness which reflects their compulsive need to order and control. Detachment from the object - \\"physical distance\\" - is a necessary condition for both artists and scientists and the capacity for abstraction gives the artist a sense of mastery over that from which he detaches himself. <br />The fact that man carries with him throughout his life a discontent of the intrinsic frustration of his infancy leaves him with a \\"divine discontent\\" which may spur him on to creative achievement. The creative, especially those with a depressive psychopathology, readily identify themselves with others and they are very fearful of undue influence so that it is their very sensitivity to what others think which makes them avoid company. <br />Furthermore, Dr Storr examines the relationship between genius and madness, that between creativity and the quest for identity and finally the creation as an act of integration. A very erudite work and yet very pleasantly written so that it is perfectly accessible even to the layman in psychology.	2005-02-28

One day he returns to his family house in northern England for the funeral of his recently deceased mother Lydia. Otto, Edmund's brother, a stone mason, still lives in the house with his wife Isabel and daughter Flora, along with Maria Magistrelli - Maggie - the nurse whom both Otto and Edmund consider as their second \\"mother\\". She is the Italian girl who brought up the two boys since neither their father John - a \\"nonentity\\" - nor Lydia - an intensely mean woman - took any part in their upbringing. <br />Their childhood passed in an alternate frenzy of jealousy and of suffocation from their mother and Edmund feels that, although he didn't return to the house for many years, he never escaped from Lydia, that she got inside him, into the depth of his being and that there was no abyss and no darkness where she was not. And soon Edmund discovers that the remaining relatives still living in the old house are entangled in a web of deceit and false pretence. Flora is pregnant by David Levkin, Otto's apprentice, who is now having an affair with Isabel whereas Elsa, David's sister, is Otto's lover. Edmund quickly realises that his brother Otto, a violently tempered man, has become an alcoholic and he wonders whether he isn't himself rapidly becoming part of \\"the machine\\". Soon he feels agitated, exasperated and confused. He finds the whole situation \\"too scandalous, too outrageous\\". Edmund is constantly on the brink of leaving, not wanting \\"to be inside such a circle of hell\\". But due to his sympathy or weakness, he feels that his presence is needed by both his sister and his niece. But little does he know about the outcome of his stay at the old family house... <br />Mrs Murdoch has been compared to Tolstoy and Dostoyevski for her literary skills and certainly \\"The Italian Girl\\" proves her capacity to show that being in love provides joy but can turn otherwise decent individuals into monsters of cruelty and blindness.	2005-02-24

On board the \\"Empress of Britain\\" they are introduced to Diana Charnwood, daughter of Fabian Charnwood, head of Charnwood Investments. Since people like Max live by their wits and can never afford to relax completely, Wingate quickly becomes aware that \\"the man who wheedles his way into Diana Charnwood's affections wheedles his way into a fortune.\\" And indeed, shortly after having been introduced to Diana Charnwood, Max writes the following promissory note: \\"I hereby undertake to share equally with my good friend Guy Horton all financial proceeds, however and/or actual marriage I contract with Miss Diana Charnwood if and whenever it may occur.\\" Is this note going to be good luck charms or, as Guy soon comes to suspect, the omens of ill fortune? <br />As usual in Mr Goddard's novels, this splendidly old fashioned affair is full of thuggery, cross and double-cross, plot and counter-plot and the reader feels like being on a roller coaster with never ending twists and bends.	2005-02-19

Mr Leavitt's ridiculously shallow and hollow novel tries to portrait an eighteen year old man, Paul Porterfield, who aspires to become a great pianist because he worships Richard Kennington, a forty year old piano prodigy. But lacking in talent, Paul's destiny is to remain a page turner. <br />What is Mr Leavitt writing about? He only hints at the psychological aspect of Paul's broken ambition which, according to the title, is supposed to be the topic of this novel. If he wants to depict the attraction of an ageing man for a young boy of eighteen, Mr Leavitt should read Thomas Mann or Stefan Zweig, both authors being much more successful on this topic. The reader will be deeply disappointed by many fastidious passages - Paul walking \\"without underwear\\", a fruit seller with a basket from which \\"scarlet peppers spilled out in obscene abundance\\" - and by the numerous and tiring clichs like \\"in Rome there is always a nearby bar\\".

The time span in \\"Rumours of Rain\\" is exactly three days, starting from Friday and extending to Monday, an \\"apocalyptic\\" week end for Martin Mynhardt during which he is going to lose not only his farm but more importantly so his wife Elise, his daughter Ilse and his son Louis. What the nature of this loss is should not be disclosed here for the sake of those who haven't read the novel yet. But Mr Brink remarkably shows how a successful businessman - Martin is the chairman of the Mining Chamber of the Afrikaans Institute of Commerce, so he has, in his own words, \\"reached the top\\" - can irremediably ruin his relationship with his family and put his career at risk because of certain choices he made in the past. Mynhardt acknowledges this in the questions he asks at the last page of the novel: \\"Does one inevitably become the victim of one's own paradoxes in the end?\\" <br />As Martin drives to his farm with his son Louis - hardly any conversation is possible between son and father since Louis was sent to fight in Angola - to convince his mother to sell it, he recollects the many acquaintances he had, the love affairs, his professional success. Many questions are posed in the novel, particularly those concerning the political situation in South Africa during the apartheid. Can any changes be brought about peacefully? What should the position of the White man be after so many years of discrimination, oppression and humiliation imposed on the Black peoples? Should one approve of any violent forms of action through which one can prove one's solidarity with the oppressed masses? <br />\\"Rumours of Rain\\" is a very complex and powerful novel - the descriptions of townships like Soweto are literally breathtaking - like the continent in which it is set.	2005-02-15

His father - and later Julius himself - used to work in a shop in Edgware Road belonging to one ebullient Ostrovski. Julius's brother Freddy showed an early talent for the violin so his parents were intent on making a prodigal performer out of him at all cost and despite the fact that that he was \\"sick before and after every performance\\" since the audience always attended his recitals as \\"a phenomenon, a fairground spectacle.\\" Naturally the parents' disappointment was all the deeper when their \\"cherished prodigy\\" had to abandon his career as a violinist after a breakdown. <br />Now that Julius is the only remaining of what used to be a family of four, he reflects on his life as he tries to get accustomed to his new flat in Chiltern Street, all the more so since new initiatives are no longer within his reach. He feels that the routine of his empty days bring him no reward, most of his actions being eternally undertaken with a sigh. After divorcing his wife Josie Burns, Julius no longer even has the heart for solitary holidays. He likes spending his time alone, aware that in solitude nobody but himself can register his decline, unable to dislodge his melancholia and almost feeling compelled by destiny to live like a recluse. Yet he knows that a solitary way of life is the only one that suits his temperament and so the time for reflecting over his past is ample. And these recollections Julius sees as a \\"lifetime of repeated episodes of defeat\\" which he considers as the essence of his sentimental education, a permanent reminder that he wasted his life. <br />So for a man like Herz, is there going to be anything next but death, is there a next big thing to come? After closing the book, the reader may not know how to answer the question but perhaps this is beside the point because Mrs Brookner'sachievement lies in the way she captures the anxieties due to old age, to a world becoming increasingly more alien because of its modernity and to memories of a lifetime one wishes one had spent in a different manner.	2005-02-14

It is not a biography in the classic sense of the term since real characters with true identities mingle with fictitious characters in episodes from the author's imagination. Nureyev's moody personality combined with his professionalism as a dancer are wonderfully captured by the author. By employing the technique of multiple narrators and skilfully interchanging between them - they are set in various locations in Russia, New York, France and England - Mr McCann has managed to produce the portrait of a vivid and many faceted artist with a tremendous charisma. Where most biographies tend to isolate and estrange its subject by pointing out its uniqueness, the author has achieved quite the opposite effect. Indeed, it often feels as if the reader were himself part of the dancer's exhilarating and thwarting lifestyle. It is the author's genius to transform carefully researched material into sparkling fiction on an artist whose fame, artistic accomplishment and shrewish, hedonistic, homosexual night life of 1970s New York are legendary.	2005-02-09

This magnificent tale tells the story of the Abd al-Jawad family who live in Palace Walk. Ahmed Abd al-Jawad and his wife Amina have two daughters, Khadija and Aisha, and three sons: Yasin is a secretary at al-Nashin school and the son of his father's previous marriage to Haniya, Fahmy is a law student and Kamal, a 10 year old boy. <br />As the reader follows the joys, sorrows and temptations of each member of the Abd al-Jawad family, he discovers what life used to be like in Cairo at the beginning of the last century. Mr Mahfouz's prose is full of psychological insight, both cultural and social observations and the tale is told with great affection, humour and sensitivity.

The narrative is performed in an emotional manner by his sister Gin. Jack's life as an artist starts in London where he attends St Martin's School of Art with his sister. But one day, at the age of seventeen, Jack falls under the spell of Vera Savage, a thirty year old artist from Glasgow. He is immediately attracted by her petulant manner, her flamboyant character although it quickly appears that this woman is neither very clean nor often sober. Gin deeply resents this \\"painted creature\\" but she can do nothing to prevent his brother from following Vera to New York. There, Jack is profoundly unhappy, sensing that Vera belongs to a world which offers no place for him, which even rejects him and Jack finds himself tramping the streets with a feeling of anger and misery. <br />Finally Jack and Vera decide to take a passage to Cuba but due to some political unrest, they are forced to leave the island and end up in Port Mungo in Honduras. There, in spite of being engaged in a torrid and complicated love affair with his wife, Jack can finally devote himself entirely to his painting. Their two daughters Peg and Ann are brought up in their parents' chaos. It is mainly Jack who raises them because Vera succumbs to infidelity and alcoholism and her chronic restlessness makes her an impossible mother. After their return to New York 20 years later, the sequels of the time they spent in Port Mungo are still there, notably Peg's death which is surrounded by a halo of mysterious circumstances. <br />In Mr McGrath's novel, human beings are held in a thrall by love, hatred, secrecy, art and complicity and despite their efforts they are unable to escape their fate.	2004-12-23

It is a journalistic account of the survival of the only one of the eight men, Luis Alejandro Velaso, who managed to reach a life raft and survived ten days with neither food nor water until he drifted to the Colombian coast and was rescued by a group of villagers. <br />The narration is incredibly gripping considering that practically nothing happens to Luis during the ten days he spent on the raft. There is only the sea, the sky, the stars, the fish, the gulls and a lonely man lost at sea. It shows what a genial storyteller Mr Marquez is, a true virtuoso of the word.

He is unhappily married to Zenobia (Zeena), a suspicious, hypochondriac, bitter, narrow-minded, ignorant and discontented woman. He is strongly attracted to Zeena's cousin Mattie Silver who shares their household and is entrusted with all the chores which Zeena refuses to do. Ethan's tragic fate begins when Zeena peremptorily decides that they need a \\"hired girl\\" which would of course imply Mattie's departure since the Fromes don't have the means to employ two girls.<br /><br />A novel of great intensity with its slow developing tragedy and characters plunging towards their destiny. The author's masterful economy of language vividly renders the oppressive \\"silent ache\\" that permanently hinders communication between Ethan and Zeena. The vision of the three main characters is done in an almost cinematic way as they are trapped indoors in the severe Massachusetts winter. The narrative pattern is original too since the whole plot is told by an unnamed narrator who met the taciturn Ethan many years after the events he is about to tell us. The reader has moments of doubt when the narrator tells a story in all details and long passages of dialogue he could not possibly have known or heard during his meeting with Ethan. But Edith Wharton's extraordinary craft makes the story break away from the contingencies of the frame and it comes to moving life for the reader. A superb novel, one of the finest and most intense narratives in the history of American literature.	2004-12-22

She is the recipient of several literary awards and on each occasion she is invited to give a lecture in which she expresses not only her ideas in her books but her view of religion, the lives of animals, the mission of a novel writer or various aesthetic issues. <br />Thus the reader is confronted in Mr Coetzee's novel with a wide range of essential thoughts: how to define the function of the novel in our lives, the specificity of native African literature, \\"The humanities teach us humanity\\", the way people treat animals compared to the way the Nazis treated the Jews - a questionable comparison? - or the fact that fiction takes us out of ourselves into other lives. Elizabeth Costello also discusses poets like Rilke or Ted Hughes or the relevance of imposing Christian faith in many African countries. How should the writers deal with the question of evil and Eros in their writings? Does a writer need to have beliefs, is he allowed to change his beliefs? <br />It is not easy to say how much Mr Coetzee wishes to tell about himself through the main character of his novel. In any case, Elizabeth Costello is a better writer than lecturer/talker: \\"Her strategy with interviews is to take control of the exchange\\" by using blocks of dialogue rehearsed in advance. \\"Even as a reader of her own stories she lacks animation\\". \\"Not her mtier, argumentation. She shouldn't be there\\". Henceforth, her lectures often lack a structure and the audience are puzzled by her changes of topic - or sometimes lack of topic - due to the fact that she is \\"full of doubt, and desperate too\\". She feels that it is not her duty to teach or preach anything through her books but merely to show how people lived in a certain place and time. <br />An accomplished work which deals with a wide range of philosophical, ethic, religious and moral issues that are so essential in our lives.	2004-12-21

George goes to work, attends staff meetings, spends his evenings with Emma, worries about money...<br /><br />It is precisely this uneventful way of life that makes Mrs Fox's novel interesting. It is the tedious and habitual way George leads his life, the utter emptiness and uselessness of his daily activities, almost as though he were living against his own volition. An \\"attitude of defeat\\" is a description used for Emma but it may equally adequately be applied to George, an attitude also shown by his clothes which hang on their hangers \\"like humble effigies of himself\\". Even his trying to help a lost youth, Ernest Jenkins, fails because George, \\"the goddamned fool\\", can only offer him dead heroes and dead poets. But George is lucid enough to be aware that he suffers from a profound disaffection with his life. \\"Poor George! I guess you have as many troubles as the rest of us\\" says one of the characters.

Ibrahim comes from an unnamed Arab country and Julie falls in love with him. Their relationship has to be kept secret all the more since Julie despises her privileged background. She is outright ashamed of her father - a businessman whose sole interest in life is money - and his new wife Danielle as well as of her mother who abandoned her daughter to marry a casino owner in California. <br />When Ibrahim receives the order to depart from South Africa within 14 days because he is in contravention of the termination of his permit, Julie tries to resort to every legal way to prolong Ibrahim's sojourn, but to no avail. When Julie informs her father that she intends to accompany Ibrahim back to his homeland, he tells her bluntly: \\"You choose to go to hell in your own way.\\" Before they depart, Julie and Ibrahim get married. Yet life in the small Arab village is far from hell. Although Ibrahim's sole concern is to obtain a visa for an English speaking country, Julie adapts quite nicely to her new surroundings, learns Arabic, teaches English and participates in the family life.

The social mix created by Mrs Gordimer between contemporary South Africa and the small Arab village in the desert is truly stunning. Let alone to see how much it takes for love to survive the circumstances of emigration and immigration, it is well worth reading \\"The Pickup\\". <br />	2004-12-16

Various characters are more or less involved in the following incident: Jim Drover, a communist bus driver, killed a policeman during a riot at Hyde Park Corner because he thought that the policeman was going to attack his wife Milly. He is now in prison sentenced to death. Milly lives in a shabby, droughty house and although she loves his husband, she starts an affair with Jim's brother Conrad, a chief clerk at the Regal Assurance Company. Conrad is unsure whether, provided that Jim's appeal is successful, the alternative of spending 18 years in prison is a better one to being executed. In any case, his depression and hatred lead him to buying a gun and trying to kill the Assistant Commissioner without realising that the bullets in the guns are blanks. Then there is Mrs Coney, the dead policeman's wife, forced by Milly to sign a petition to save Jim from execution. And Kay Rimmer, Milly's sister, a worker at a match factory, a prostitute of sorts who frequently visits Mr Surrogate, writer of books of economics and socialist idealism.  If \\"it's a battlefield\\", the reader may wonder what those protagonists are fighting for. Although Mr Greene casts a critical glance at institutions such as the Scotland Yard, trade unions, politics or the law, the characters' actions often appear to be meaningless. But perhaps this is the author's point: whatever the battle, one struggles in vain... \\"Brighton Rock\\" or \\"The Human Factor\\" are more carefully constructed novels in which Graham Greene showed his talent as a novelist.	2004-12-15

On the historical side, the story opens with the digging of a railway tunnel under the East River in New York in 1916. The reader follows the main character, a coloured man called Nathan Walker, a sandhog who struggles daily with his shovel against the earth. The working conditions are atrocious: the heat, the noise, the dirt, the physical strain - the digging was done by manpower in these days. Later Nathan marries Eleanor O'Lear, a white woman of Irish descent. Such a marriage was considered by most New Yorkers as a disgrace at that time. They bring up two children, both a social and a financial challenge. <br />Parallel to Nathan Walker's story, the reader follows another character, a homeless man nicknamed Treefrog who made his home in one of the many disused tunnels in New York in the 1990s. At first there appears to be no connection between Nathan and Treefrog but soon enough the reader discovers how and why they are linked in the novel. <br />With a marvellous narrative for its economy, Mr McCann constructs a beautiful epic story of laughter and tragedy, of sadness and small victories. It is an authentic account about homelessness, about living below the rich and about the stronghold of the past.	2004-10-16

Adriaan is a secluded character who does not wish to discuss or read his poetry in public, who doesn't feel compelled to advertise his writing in literary journals. He isn't interested in so-called \\"admirers\\" of Afrikaans literature either and he is thus a fairly isolated figure in the small community of writers and artists of Cape Town. The fact that his companion Stephan left him a short while ago makes him feel even more lonely. Among his friends, Nico is a superficial and conceited actor relentlessly looking for an improbable lover in the latest cruising points in the city. The atmosphere of sadness and desolation is increased by the fact that Cape Town is becoming slowly depopulated and continuously invaded by the homeless and dispossessed who set up their camps among the empty, neglected and decayed buildings. The squatters' filthy shelters pop up everywhere in streets and in parks. Hawkers, peddlers, hucksters, thieves and beggars slowly creep into the city centre. As the oppression against the natives increases, bloody corpses litter the streets, blood is smeared over the pavement. \\"We learned not to ask questions; we learned to keep silent, we learned to accept.\\" writes Mr. Schoeman. At the same time the members of the white community remain securely barricaded with their money and their comfort behind the high walls surrounding their properties. Gradually, acquaintances are leaving: Bernard's wife Marisa is leaving for Holland. She wishes \\"never even hear the name South Africa any more.\\" The days of the small museum where Adriaan works are numbered, a decison taken by some official in Pretoria. Employees are gradually leaving it and looking for other job opportunities. Carla closes down her beach house in Brandvlei, knowing that she'll probably never return to it again. Even Dekker, an renown old poet, though physically still present in the country, took leave long ago and shut himself from the world with disillusionment. <br />A very powerful novel depicting the darkest epoch of South Africa. The story of many characters drowning in sadness and abandonment because there is little hope for art, poetry or love in the future.	2004-10-16

Garay is a young Argentinean in his mid twenties of half English descent because of his mother. He teaches English at the Instituto San Martin, a job he profoundly dislikes because of its monotony. He distrusts people and prefers to spend time alone, surprised if anyone likes him or approves of him, often seeing the world as separate from himself. When his mother is at work, he enjoys pretending that he is a woman, putting on her underwear, her skirts and blouses. When his mother dies, Garay's solitude becomes really oppressive. Moreover, it is a period of unrest in Argentina: the Malvinas war, the end of the Allende regime and the political emergence of a cowboy called Carlos Menem. <br />Garay's life starts changing after he meets Susan and Donald Ford. They offer him a job as a consultant/interpreter/guide for a group of American officials visiting Buenos Aires on business. Being quite successful, Susan and Donald suggest some time later that Garay opens his own office as a consultant. He gladly accepts their proposition and happily leaves his career as a teacher behind him for ever. <br />Although Garay always believed that he was happier alone, he realises that he is desperate for someone.

In his early childhood, at the very beginning of the 20th century, Stephen was sent to Clongowes, a Jesuit boarding school near Dublin. He disliked the place because his classmates bullied him, because he was taught religion in a dogmatic way and because he was flogged unjustly by his prefect of studies. After that he spent a summer with his uncle Charles in Dublin. Stephen was then sent to Belvedere college, which he disliked as much as Clongowes. The spirit of quarrelsome comradeship couldn't turn him away from his habits of quiet obedience. He mistrusted the agitation and doubted the sincerity of such comradeship, which he felt was an awful anticipation of adulthood. <br />Stephen was by then aware that he didn't belong. He also felt more and more estranged from his father after having accompanied him once to Cork and witnessed his drinking habits, a journey which ended in Stephen's first experience in love making - a sordid one. <br />More disappointment followed as Stephen went to university, thus becoming a disillusioned young man - a disillusionment caused by academicism, love and sex, his parents, religion and perhaps also his own country, Ireland...	2004-09-27

The main characters are the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, Dr Joseph Bauer, one of the founders of psychoanalysis, and a then young (the year is 1882) medical intern called Sigmund Freud. As these protagonists discuss their ideas, preoccupations and frustrations, they create an original plot of a fictional relationship between an exceptional analysand and a talented analyst. As the fictional dialogue between Breuer and Nietzsche unfolds, the reader becomes aware of the fact that at this epoch it must have been the first time that a doctor realised that what mattered is not what a patient said but that he said it. These were truly the first steps towards psychotherapy. Breuer's task was not made easy by Nietzsche's character. His social fears and his misanthropy made him select an impersonal and distant style. His tone was often harsh and brittle, particularly when he talked about his deceptive lover, Lou Salom, a woman Nietzsche actually met in the spring of 1882. The unpleasant experience he had with this one and only love affair made him resentful towards women. He felt that they corrupted and spoiled him, he avoided them because he thought that he was ill suited for them. This partly explains Nietzsche's total isolation, his feeling of belonging nowhere, having no lover, no circle of friends, no home, no family hearth, his life sounding like a hollow echo. <br />A wonderful achievement showing sad and troubled characters in an intriguing cross-discussion of philosophy and emerging psychotherapy, yet as gripping to read as a detective story.	2004-09-23

The tale is a subtle maze of poetry and case history, dreams, fantasy and historical facts. The novel opens with a letter written by Sigmund Freud about one of his patients, a young woman singer whose career was interrupted and who wrote \\"verses\\" between the staves of a score of \\"Don Giovanni\\" showing that she suffers from a severe sexual hysteria. <br />Indeed, in the first chapter, the reader is confronted with Lisa's \\"verse\\", a mixture of pornographic material and hallucinatory dreams of horrible events that took place at a white hotel set in the Austrian Alps. Then follows an account in prose of how the patient allegedly met Freud's son who took her to the white hotel where she experienced a nearly constant sado-masochistic love making. There she also \\"witnessed\\" several tragedies: the hotel catching fire, people perishing in a landslide or in a cable-car accident. <br />Following this account, a fictional Freudian case study partly explains Lisa's hallucinations through a careful analysis of her youth. After Freud's psychotherapy, Lisa appears to have regained her sanity because as of the spring of 1929, she resumes her career as a singer and becomes quite a renown artist. The reader follows her from Milan to Vienna where she marries Victor. Her voice gradually fades in quality and her final move is to Odessa before World War II and before the Nazis manage to occupy this Russian city. <br />A book to experience rather than simply to read, a haunting and strange novel, its plot woven like a tapestry, full of beautiful and sad characters.	2004-09-14

They exchanged many letters and the reader can discover the 56 letters that Wittgenstein sent to Malcolm between March 26 1940 to April 16 1951 in this book. <br />Norman Malcolm does not discuss Wittgenstein's philosophical works - although he attended a respectable number of his lectures - but describes the philosopher in his daily life, his tastes, his talks with his fellows in Cambridge. It is interesting to learn that Wittgenstein was an emphatic talker both while lecturing and conversing privately, that he dressed as simply as possible although he had rigorous standards of cleanliness and that his room at Trinity College was austerely furnished. <br />His lectures were quite original. He didn't address his audience in a formal way but the meetings - in his room where the members of the class had to bring chairs - were rather a conversation during which Wittgenstein carried on original research. He was usually impatient and easily angered and his students often feared him. Making friendship with Wittgenstein was very exacting since his extreme harshness could rebuke a friend. Malcolm often experienced that Wittgenstein had a tendency to be suspicious of motives and character. It was always a strain to be with Wittgenstein because of the intellectual demands of his conversation and his ruthless severity. This was due to his passionate love of truth and that is the reason why his philosophical thoughts tortured and exhausted him. He detested academic life, he could not stand the society of his academic colleagues and could not suffer all forms of affectation and insincerity. His mood was often sombre because of the difficulty of achieving understanding in philosophy. As he struggled to work through a problem, his listeners felt that they were in the presence of real suffering. That may explain his strong inclination to pessimism, a feeling that was often close to despair. Another source of torment was that he felt himself to be a failure as a teacher, a profession he abandoned after a few years to devote himself exclusively to philosophy. <br />Towards the end of his life, Wittgenstein spent long months with Malcolm and his wife in America where Malcolm could witness Wittgenstein's increasing difficulty to concentrate and think, mainly because of his fragile health. A moving memory of one of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century.	2004-09-07

He has jurisdiction over the garrison. But with the arrival of Colonel Joll from the Third Bureau - the most important division of the Civil Guard - the peaceful life is about to end for the magistrate. The arrival of Joll and his troops is justified by the fact that in the capital there is some concern about the barbarian tribes of the north uniting with those of the west, which may lead to unrest. Joll's methods of interrogation are brutal, his evidence against the native prisoners based on thin air. \\"Prisoners are prisoners\\" is enough of an accusation to lead a man or a woman to death. <br />When the magistrate decides to take a twenty year old girl with whom he had a relationship back to her tribe of barbarians, he is accused of having treasonously conspired with the enemy and the treatment inflicted on him thereafter is no less inhuman than that endured by the barbarians themselves. This is the price the magistrate has to pay for giving up his \\"alliance with the guardians of the Empire\\" and setting himself into opposition, thus becoming an enemy of the state. <br />Mr Coetzee's book shows all the suffering that the apartheid regime used to inflict on native South Africans. Furthermore, it shows that this regime was capable of committing the same atrocities against people of their own kin.	2004-09-06

Although these vary from country to country and from epoch to epoch, various patterns of sexual behaviour can be considered as generic Although certain behaviours can be considered as unnatural, they are widely spread among both women and men in the Western civilisation. Dr Storr is chiefly concerned with the description of the origins of most deviations.<br /><br />The feeling of guilt is an essential factor in the production of sexual deviation because our societies place some restraints upon sexual conduct. With certain children, the feeling of guilt is so strong that they're unable to overcome it and continue to carry it with them into adult life with the result that their capacity for forming adult relationships is impaired. Extreme sexual guilt prevents a person from falling in love, since he or she cannot believe that another will find acceptable what he or she has himself or herself tried to reject.<br /><br />A conviction of sexual inferiority is an equally strong impediment. This is particularly the case with men since first they have to achieve and sustain erection, second the male has to become quite a different creature from his mother in the process of development from child to adult and third there is no male equivalent to child bearing. Furthermore, a boy whose father is either absent or indifferent has less chance of developing into a sexually confident adult male because the parent of the same sex fails the child by being a deficient sexual model. So the inferiority feeling so characteristic of the sexually deviant usually originates in an early failure in identification.<br /><br />Dr Storr examines different types of deviation like sado-masochism (relationships which try to re-create childish patterns in which one partner is acting the child and the other is assuming the role of parent), fetishism (in this case the fetish acts as a reassurance, a defence against fear, a magical device which ensures potency), transvestism (the transvestite may be said to have sexual relations with clothes instead of with a person), male and female homosexuality, exhibitionism, frotteurism, voyeurism, paedophilia and buggery.<br /><br />In the last part of his book, Dr Storr examines the methods of treatment of sexual deviants, notably by analytical psychotherapy.<br /><br />An instructive study allowing the reader to realise that a sexual deviation is the outward sign of a failure to make an adult love-relationship, the study of sexual deviation being nothing else than the study of sex without love.

This is not only due to the twisty nature of the plot - intermittently describing events nearly 10 years distant in time - but also to the great number of characters often involved in confusing situations resulting from witty misunderstandings. This is not in the least to say that the novel is confusing, on the contrary, the non-linear plot is an essential part of the originality of \\"The House of Sleep\\". <br />In the 1980s a group of students were studying at the imposing college of Ashdown on the English South Coast before drifting apart. A decade later, Ashdown has become the Dudden Clinic where the increasingly unstable Dr Dudden investigates the mechanisms of sleep, using both animals and human beings for his various experiments. Due to a series of coincidences involving various disorders in their sleep patterns, these students are drawn back together. Sarah is narcoleptic, she has dreams so vivid that she can't distinguish them from real events, Robert whose identity is about to change completely due to misunderstandings that come from his/her condition and Terry, the insomniac film critic who spends his nights with his obsessions with movies. And finally Dr Dudden who considers sleep as a disease shortening people's lives by a third. <br />A compelling novel about love, loss and obsession.	2004-08-24

These areas of land are impoverished and underdeveloped, set aside by the apartheid government for the self determination of its various black nations. As Frank Eloff joins the staff of five for a one year training, he soon discovers that there is virtually no activity at the hospital. Most of the people living in the abandoned town - built once by what Laurence terms as \\"a puppet dictator\\" - aren't even aware of the presence of the facility! The equipment is so flimsy that most cases have to be referred to a hospital in a town an hour away. <br />Nevertheless, Mr Galgut masterfully describes the relationships between the staff members, at times showing harmony, at times tension and discord. Laurence's thoughts are busy with his failed marriage, with his father resenting him for being what one may call a loser - he ironically talks about \\"such wonderful work you do up there amongst the rural blacks\\" - or with his memories of the two years he spent in the army. <br />An altogether impressive read, atmospheric with the heavy heat of South Africa, its political and racial issues and the permanent threat of violence which many authors associate with their country in their novels - J.M. Coetzee, Andr Brink, Nadine Gordimer or Doris Lessing to name but a few.	2004-08-24

He has to change trains in Detroit and since he has several hours at his leisure, he decides to visit the Detroit Institute of Arts. There, he is puzzled by a photograph taken by Augustus Sander in 1914 showing three farmers on their way to a dance. The reader follows the narrator's progress as he tries to find answers to the questions that preoccupy him about the photograph: who took it, why was it taken, who are the three farmers appearing in the picture. <br />On another level, Mr Powers gives a fictional account - or it may also be the result of the narrator's research, it is not explicit in the text - of the action taking place at the time the photograph was taken and also what happens subsequently. And so the reader gets to know the three farmers Hubert, Peter and Adolphe. <br />Yet on another level, the author introduces various contemporary characters working in the Powell Building for a magazine called \\"Micro Monthly News\\": Mays, Moseley, Delaney. After having at first the impression that the events at this level are unrelated to the two other levels, the reader soon realises that there is a connection indeed. <br />What makes Mr Powers's novel interesting are his many reflections on various topics. These range from the situation of a small Belgian village called Petit Roi during the First World War, the part that Henry Ford played in that war, various personalities like Darwin, Freud, Gdel, Planck or Sarah Bernhardt, to the Industrial Revolution and the changes that mechanisation brought to our civilisation. And because the main protagonist so to speak of the novel is a photograph, Mr Powers also deals in detail in the history of photography. <br />A very instructive novel, plenty of interesting points of view that show Mr Powers's broad knowledge.	2004-08-20

The text comes in the form of 13 parcels of varying length (from 7 to 50 pages). Sometimes they are sheets of National Bank or Bank of New South Wales letterhead, a cloth booklet, octavo pages, open envelopes providing space for text, a pocket diary or the reverse side of advertising fliers. They cover Ned's adventurous life until the manuscript abruptly terminates when he was 26 years old and it is told in a tone so wild and passionate that the reader often believes that the bushranger is speaking to him from the grave! It is a breathtaking account of an existence marked by a cascade of events where Ned is in turn a reformer, a criminal, a horse thief, a farmer, a bushranger and an orphan. Ned's voice is very convincing, continually creating new surprises on every page despite the plainness of his language, or rather perhaps because of it. Actually his uneducated voice is very much part of the originality of Mr Carey's novel. <br />The critics have ranked Mr Carey next to Charles Dickens and Lawrence Sterne - very rightly so, in my opinion.	2004-08-20

It is the period of the height of the youth riots in the township of Soweto. At Ben's school, Gordon Ngubene, a native, is a cleaner and he occasionally does little chores for Ben. When Ben sees that Jonathan, Gordon's son, is showing signs of intelligence and diligence, he decides to partly finance his education. One day however, Jonathan takes part in a demonstration which ends up in a violent riot and is arrested by the police. A few weeks later, after a harrowing quest through countless offices, Ben and Gordon are informed that Jonathan died \\"of natural causes\\" while in detention. <br />Due to the mystery surrounding his son's death, Gordon gives up his job in order to devote himself entirely to the enquiries which have become an obsession with him. Both the Special Branch and the Security Police are annoyed about Gordon's insistence and soon enough Gordon is arrested. After numerous attempts to try to trace Gordon and speak to him, Ben and Gordon's wife Emily are told by the spokesman of the Security Police that Gordon apparently committed suicide by hanging himself with strips torn from his blanket. <br />But Ben Du Toit senses that the official explanations for both Jonathan's and Gordon's deaths are just a pretext for poorly disguised murders and so he decides to take matters in his own hands and starts investigating. <br />Mr Brink's novel is a harrowing account of a solitary man's fight against all the atrocities of the Apartheid. During this dark period in the history of South Africa, a white man had to be a real hero to fight for the right of the Afrikaners. The author beautifully captures the fact that Ben has to fight not only the resentment of the people of the other race, but also that of the people belonging to his own race - his family for a start. The descriptions of the townships of Johannesburg, particularly that of Soweto, are breathtaking in their accuracy and poignancy.	2004-08-06

It is interesting to learn how many people of genius were lonely-goers: their creative talent, their mental instability and their incapacity for making satisfying personal relationships are closely linked. Such famous people as Descartes, Newton, Locke, Pascal, Spinoza, Kant, Leibniz, Schopenhauer, Nietsche, Kierkegaard, Kafka or Wittgenstein were all lonely people without necessarily being unhappy. These people were great thinkers and it is remarkable to see that thinking is essentially a solitary activity. The capacity to be alone is necessary for the brain to function at its best and it is also an aspect of emotional maturity. Learning, thinking, creating and maintaining contact with one's inner world are all facilitated by solitude. Great religious figures also have recognised that solitude promotes insight. Buddha, Jesus, St Matthew, St Luke and Mahomet all spent part of their existence in some sort of retreat. They all understood that solitude allows to escape from the pressure of ordinary life and is a way of spiritual renewal. It may well be that monastic seclusion and the absence of close personal ties in such institutions not only facilitate the individual's relation with God, but also fosters scholarship. <br />Solitude is a sign of inner security rather than the expression of a withdrawn state. It also appears probable that those who prefer to be alone are more at ease with inanimate objects or with abstract concepts than they are with other people. This need to be alone is derived from or is enhanced by some degree of insecure attachment in early childhood. This was the case of people like Rudyard Kipling, H. H. Munro, P. G. Wodehouse or George Simenon. For them, the process of creation was a way of protecting themselves against being overwhelmed by depression. Their interests take over some of the functions more usually performed by intimate relationships. Because the higher reaches of abstraction require long periods of solitude and intense concentration which are hard to achieve if one has to meet the emotional demands of friends or a wife and children. And it is a consolation to learn that people living in a secluded manner do not suffer at all because interpersonal relationships are not the only way of finding emotional fulfilment. <br />Dr Storr also devotes a fascinating chapter to enforced solitude and the harrowing effects that solitary confinement can have on the human mind. He quotes Francis Bacon: \\"The worst solitude is to be destitute fo sincere friendship\\". <br />Dr Storr's study of solitude is a marvellous book, very readable even for the layman in psychology and very instructive too.	2004-08-06

Although every precaution is taken after the plane has landed in Heathrow, several passengers, Dr Palmer and a stewardess die a few days later of the same symptoms as Barclay because they had come close to the sick man without any protection. Dr Steven Dunbar, a Sci-Med investigator, is commissioned to investigate the case and when a post-mortem is performed on Barclay's body, a filovirus is discovered as being the cause for his haemorrhagic fever. However, this is surprising because scientists agree on the fact that there is no haemorrhagic fever in Ndanga. Even more surprising is the fact that a young woman, Ann Danby, is found dead in her flat in Manchester, also having succumbed to haemorrhagic fever. As more and more cases are reported with completely unrelated patients throughout the British Isles, a race against time starts for Dr Dunbar and his colleagues to find and eradicate the mysterious disease. <br />An entertaining medical thriller in the same vein as Michael Palmer or Robin Cook.	2004-07-30

One day he is accosted by one blind Watkin telling him that his employer wants to commission him to paint her portrait. Provided that he manages to disengage himself from his current promises at once, Watkin's employer is willing to pay Piambo three times as much as he would have earned with his other engagements. Piambo agrees and he is soon to meet the mysterious Mrs Chrabuque at her place. She appears behind a screen and explains to Piambo that he will have to paint her without ever being allowed to cast an eye on her. He will be allowed to visit Mrs Chrabuque for an hour daily and from the information she will give him, he will have to construct in his mind an image of her and paint her. If Piambo manages to capture her likeness, she is ready to double the already overwhelming money she is willing to pay him. <br /> The idea for the plot of this novel is excellent and it would have been interesting to follow the painter's mind to see how he succeeds in actually picturing a face he is not allowed to see. Unfortunately, Piambo is soon drawn into an adventure with Shenz, a fellow artist, who persuades him to try to cheat and find a way to discover what Mrs Charbuque looks like. Then there Mrs Charbuque's long narrative about her father being a crystalogogist and his science of reading snow flakes. In the end there is so much mysticism that the topic of art and painting slides into the background as we watch Piambo being involved, as he states himself, into an &quot;affair resembling a convoluted dream shattered by waking&quot; which poses the question of the credibility of the whole plot.	2004-07-30

After having been driven to a nearly fatal assault on his child Martin, Dawn is placed in an institution. The text closes with Dawn reflecting as follows: &quot;I have high hopes of finding whose fault I am.&quot; <br /> &quot;The narrative of Jacobus Coetzee&quot; is actually a translation from Afrikaans by J.M. Coetzee of a text published in 1762. It is the account of a hideous vengeance of a frontiersman on a tribe of Hottentots in South Africa. <br /> Both Eugene Dawn in the 1970s and Jacobus Coetzee in the 1760s are dealers in death who claim their humanity and impressively express their feelings of guilt.	2004-07-30

Books	5	3	4	N	N	An impressive novel	Knut Hamsun's novel tells the story of a young writer living in Christiana (nowadays Oslo) in Norway at the end of the 19th century. As it was extremely difficult for him to make a living from the few newspaper articles he managed to sell for a few kroner, he constantly lived on the verge of famine. Very often his psyche was badly affected by numerous refusals, hopes built up and knocked down so that he often lost courage. His extreme poverty forced the writer to live in rooms &quot;not furnished in a way appropriate to intellectual effort&quot; which also had a negative impact on his literary muse. <br /> Hamsun never mentions his hero's name; it is as if he were a perpetual foreigner in his surroundings and his hunger transforms him into a sociopath: he is famished not because he cannot find a job in Christiana but because he is stubbornly determined to live from his writing, although he is just a beginner. His loneliness is the consequence both of his constant striving for food and for inspiration and his inability to make friends because he has no patience for others. Another interesting aspect is the young writer's ambiguous feeling towards God whom he both fears and curses for his fate, but destiny neither provides him with inspiration nor allows him to die; he is constantly saved by temporary deliverance - an editor accepts one of his articles, he is paid five kroner and he is saved for a few days until the ordeal begins again. The hero is so estranged from his environment that he emerges almost lifeless. He has no plans for the future, expecting some happy chance, almost always resigned and melancholy. The young writer is nothing but a chain of moods changing constantly, often without consistency. He doubts the existence of God, yet he prays to Him. He loves yet at the same time belittles this love. He strives for literary revelation yet he is frivolous in his approach to literature. <br /> The power of &quot;Hunger&quot; is that doubt found in Hamsun its narrator par excellence.	2004-07-26

Though their life appears to be idyllic given the setting and the climate, they both have to work hard growing vegetables and fruit, producing wine and olive oil in order to make both ends meet. But why did Richard decide to leave his fatherland and emigrate to Italy? The reason for this matter may seem slightly utopian at first glance but Mr Cook manages to describe the situation so masterfully that it is utterly believable - even more so, considering what we know today about the former East-European countries. Indeed, Richard used to be a journalist at the time when a certain Jobling was Prime Minister. Richard was made redundant when he predicted that Jobling, for fear of being thrown out at the next election, would simply announce that he was going to rule by himself. And indeed, it turned out that there was practically nothing to stop him, making Richard's prediction true. After a particularly vitriolic TV interview, Jobling won the election just the same and Richard was put on a blacklist so that he couldn't afford to live in Britain anymore. But Jobling isn't about to forget Richard Watt and he finds out means to extradite him. For Richard, being forced to return to Britain, now a crumbling and decaying totalitarian state, will prove, as you may guess, to be fatal. <br /> A harrowing and powerful account,	2004-07-23

And what better place to find such character than a society set up in the honour of the dubiously talented authors Susannah and Joshua Sneddon? <br />These two authors toiled in the early years of the 20th century at their creative tasks in a remote cottage of Mikelwike, a small village in Yorkshire. Neither wrote masterpieces but Susanna's books were always more popular than her brother's. That's perhaps why Joshua one day killed his sister with an axe and then shot himself in the head. <br />Many years later, there is a renewed interest in the Sneddons, inspired by entrepreneur Gerald Suzman. He bought the Sneddon cottage, with plans to open a museum and to found a literary society called the Sneddon Fellowship. Sneddon enthusiasts from as far away as America, Norway and Japan gather at Suzman's invitation for the inauguration of the society during a Sneddon Weekend. DC Charlie Peace joins the party, intrigued by Suzman's unexpected literary interest in the Sneddond. Suzman's history shows a far greater penchant for wealth than literature, so he must have discovered a source of profit in the Fellowship. But where? <br />Charlie fears that an elderly American lady called Lettie Farraday may know too much for her own good. Lettie, who has returned to Mikelwike, the village of her birth, for the first time in fifty years, is the only conferee who personally knew the Sneddons. Too much knowledge may be dangerous...	2004-07-23

The reader meets Eve Gordon who endured a harrowing childhood with her alcoholic parents; now 39, she lives a life of virtual isolation and desperately wants to become her therapist's friend. Many sessions are spent with Eve curled up in the corner of the practice without uttering a single word. Bruce Marins, a cripple - a &quot;Thalidomide baby&quot;, a drug taken by his mother to cure her morning sickness - who rejects sympathy as being patronising, who feels anger and distrust of people around him and who sees deceit, pity and rejection wherever he turns. As Dr Rubin is about to greet Bonnie Paulsen and Jerry Stillman in her office, she is far from picturing the way these two patients are going to deceive her with their egregious lies and carefully plotted hoax - &quot;How easily any patient can defeat even the most artful and accomplished therapist.&quot; she writes! Jake Garvin suffers from manic-depressive psychosis and so needs help because he's having trouble writing his dissertation for his degree. This is all the more urgent since the two job offers Jake has received depend on his finishing his dissertation. A case which will unfortunately end very tragically. Richard Durbin and Valerie Goldner are a yuppie couple. But why does Richard stubbornly refuse to have a child with Valerie? What mysterious event in his past makes him refuse to become a father? And finally there is the case of Delfina Ortega, a Mexican American, who was pregnant at 16, then became an excellent high school student graduating near the top of her class, who was subsequently awarded full scholarship to the university and then, when she was accepted to a graduate programme in Latin American history, she falls into a panic attack. <br /> Dr Rubin's cases are a wonderful read for those of us who are mere laymen in the field of psychology.	2004-07-23

At the beginning of the novel, he is in his mid twenties and has been awarded a stipend by the University of Kansas Press to fund the publication of a biography of Jules Gund, the author of a single work of fiction called &quot;The Gondola&quot;. But before Omar can start doing research for the biography, he needs the authorisation of the Gund literary trust which consists of three people: Caroline and Adam Gund and Arden Langdon, all three living in Ochos Rios, Uruguay. After having written to the trustees, Omar receives their disappointing answer: they refuse to grant him the authorisation he needs for the biography. Being a rather hesitant and indecisive young man - perhaps the archetype of the doctoral student in literature - Omar is about to give up his plans when he is convinced by his buoyant girlfriend Deidre that it is his duty not to abate, not to abandon his literary project. At this point the reader's mind is already full of questions: why don't the trustees want to grant the permission? Is there some aspect of Jules Gund's life that they want to keep secret for ever? Will Omar - considering his character - be able to change their mind?   Mr Cameron's novel features subtle dialogue, reflections about love, loss, grief, posterity. The descriptions of Ochos Rios, a languid and dreamy place, are superb. Even though the atmosphere is at times as heavy as the humid air of the jungle, wit and comedy still find their place in this superbly crafted novel.	2004-07-20

It is when Rydal sees Chester at the Benaki Museum for the first time that his resemblance to Rydal's father's twin brother strikes him. Rydal then decides to keep an eye on Chester. A few days later, Chester gets the unpleasant visit of a Greek police officer who informs him that he is working in co-operation with the American authorities. The latter are apparently more and more interested in Chester's shady past. Realising that he may well be arrested and extradited, Chester hits the policeman who then stumbles and falls, banging his head against the bathtub. A fatal blow.

There are the teenagers and their reluctance to accept the authority of their teachers or parents, the loss of freedom resulting from marriage, the pain people can feel, both physical and emotional, memories from childhood or the army. There are the inevitable haunted, vulnerable and dependent characters. In some short stories, writers appear, too: &quot;Writers who write about writers can bring on the worst kind of miscarriage.&quot; writes one of them! There is the pleasure given to children by their father?s visitation days, his hugs and their smells of linen, whisky and tobacco. In the stories collected under the title &quot;Liars in Love&quot;, couples separating is a frequent - almost repetitive - topic. It seems to me that once you have reached a certain age and experience in life, Mr Yates's prose simply confirms your own feelings and seems, not downright commonplace, but lacking in originality. In this literary genre, it is my opinion that Raymond Carver, Nadine Gordimer or Jhumpa Lahiri are more enjoyable authors.	2004-07-20

Josh found work at Colstar International in the same town. Colstar is the largest producer of portable power sources and they specialise in producing several types of batteries. Truly enough, Patience owes its wealth to this large company. After about five weeks in Patience, Abby notices that Josh is becoming irritable, distracted, easily fatigued and more and more frequently suffers from violent headaches which make him reach for the bottle, something he never used to do before. Furthermore, several patients treated by Abby seem to suffer from the same symptoms as Josh. After having had their blood analysed by an independent laboratory, it appears that these patients were all contaminated by cadmium. Colstar refuses to locate the source of the contamination because it would cost them too much to close the plant for any length of time. When Abby's investigations become too pressing, the director of Patience Regional Hospital, Joe Henderson, asks her to resign, menacing her with the falsified report on the death of one of her patients, Peggy Wheaton. But it is only when one night, returning home from work, Abby is shot at several times that she understands that the threat from Colstar is not to be taken lightly... <br />A very good medical thriller.	2004-07-20

Dr Cake is a frail man suffering from tuberculosis but his intellectual strength is still intact. Both men's passion is poetry and the conversation unfolds around great poets like Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelly or Keats. But it is when Dr Cake expresses some doubts about Keats's death that the two men start reflecting on the afterlife of poets. What if Keats had decided to stage his own disappearance and continued to live under another identity? Strangely enough, like Keats, Dr Cake was born in 1795, went to school near London, started working as a doctor and then gave it up to devote himself to poetry. And why was Dr Cake buried with no name on the brass plate screwed on his coffin-lid? Perhaps &quot;Dr Cake&quot; is an invention after all...	2004-06-17

He visits Patricia Highsmith in Tegna and they talk about Ripley and Ruth Rendell, he meets Rachel Berg with her stunning story of the &quot;Baroness de St Leger and the Golden Amulet&quot;. There is Professors Eschenbaum's ebullient narration of &quot;The Disappearing Courtesan&quot; in Venice. The various dialogues of the protagonists about literature, architecture, society and history undoubtedly show what an erudite author Mr Dessaix is. But because the narrator is HIV positive, there are also many reflections throughout the novel linked to the disease. His relationship to his friend Peter, for example, who doesn't blame him for having chosen an adventurous way of life. The fact that the narrator knows not only - as we all do - that he is going to die but that he is going to do so in the near future changes his perception of time. &quot;Time now is for beguiling, not for spending profitably&quot; he says. He also dwells on the concept of solitude compared to loneliness, abandonment or desertion. He feels that certain acquaintances are to be enjoyed and then simply to be moved on from. The narrator also refuses to start crafting the approaching end of his life and states that it is essential to invest with meaning the moment we're living through. And then there is the closing idea of this remarkable novel that kindness is undervalued and that we shouldn't want to live without it.	2004-06-11

He was a liar, a boastful man and a voluminous writer of mediocre verse. He was also dabbing in Satanism, magic and occult. He inspired Somerset Maugham and served as a model for Oliver Haddo in &quot;The Magician&quot;.<br /> Arthur Burdon, surgeon of St Luke's in London, has just arrived in Paris to study the methods of the French operators. But he has also come there to see Margaret Dauncy with whom he is in love. It is Dr Porhoet, a lifetime friend of Arthur's, who introduces him to Oliver Haddo. This obese, fleshy-faced man with an imposing paunch claims to be a magician. At a dinner party, the guests can hardly believe the stories told by this charlatan. They wonder whether he is an impostor or a madman and how much he really believes what he says. Does he deceive himself or is he laughing up his sleeve at the madness of those who take him seriously? To Arthur's bewilderment, as he is about to marry Margaret, she falls under the spell of Oliver Haddo and flees with him. Yet Arthur can hardly picture into what abyss of horror and evil Margaret will be driven.<br /> A complex and perceptive novel.

But then Jack found out that certain &quot;irregularities&quot; took place at MediaTronics and, advised by his attorney Gary Marder, resigned from his job and became a &quot;househusband&quot;. Now he is coping with all the chores at home, looking after his three children.   Jack's wife Julia works for Xymos Technology, developing technology in what the company calls &quot;molecular manufacturing&quot; or nanotechnology. Since she is the vice president, she is not often present at home.   The plot starts picking up when Julia is severely injured in a car accident, the circumstances of which seem rather mysterious. At the same time, Jack is asked by Tim Bergman to take a consulting job with Xymos. But when Jack joins Xymos at an isolated, sate-of-the-art facility in Nevada, he soon discovers that the technology the company is doing research on is far from flawless...   Perfect suspense combined with lots of technology, this is one of Mr Crichton's most entertaining novels.   George Wilson reading &quot;Prey&quot; is a remarkable performance.

US	36232108	R1V2PFIMQMWKH4	0451077679	158144239	The Confessions of Nat Turner	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Magnificent	In August 1831, in a remote region of south-eastern Virginia, took place the only effective and sustained revolt in the history of American Negro slavery. That year, a black man, Nat Turner, awaits death in a prison cell. He is a slave, a preacher and the leader of the revolt. Mr Styron based his novel on the single significant contemporary document concerning this insurrection, namely a brief pamphlet of twenty pages called &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot;, published in Richmond in 1831. The confession Turner made to his jailers under the duress of his God is a narrative describing a good man's transformation into an avenging angel even as it encompasses all the betrayals, cruelties and humiliations that made up slavery - and that is still present in the collective psyches of both races.   This magnificent book brilliantly depicts the American past in a dazzling narrative.	2004-05-06

In 1918 during a violent storm which floods the country, this difficult and taciturn man encounters a young woman called Armrita in a cave. After an expert and violent [adult] scene, the Englishman is killed by the flood and Armrita is taken to Agra to be married to Razdan, a distinguished court pleader who belongs to one of the highest and most distinguished castes in all Hindustan. Some months later, Armrita gives birth to a son, Pran Nath, who is actually Ronald Forrester's child, and dies after delivering the baby. A few years later, when Razdan learns that is son is the &quot;illegitimate child of a casteless, filth eating, left-and-right-hand-confusing Englishman&quot;, he dies of shock. Now an orphan, Pran Nath is thrown out of the house by the chowkidar and becomes one of the many homeless of Agra.   So begins the epic life of a young boy of six in India. His odyssey-like journey will take him from Agra to the red light district of Bombay, then to the brick cloisters of the University of Oxford and finally to Fotseland, in Africa. It is the sad story of a man never understanding who he really is, neither really Indian nor really English, despite all his efforts. Mr Kunzru meditates on the construction of identity, self deprecation, miscegenation and racism in an ambitious and remarkable first novel.	2004-04-28

Santiago Nasar got up at five-thirty in the morning on the Monday he was going to be killed by the twins Pedro and Pablo Vicario. The narrator is told by Placida Linero, Santiago Nasar's mother, that within the hour, her 21 year old son would be dead. Why did the twins want to kill the proprietor of The Divine Face, the ranch he had inherited from his father? Why did they chose that particular morning, when the bishop was due to visit the village? Why wasn't Santiago Nasar aware of the fact that somebody had shoved an envelope under the door of his house with a written document warning him that he was going killed, stating in addition the place, the motive and other quite precise details of the plot? How could the murder have been committed despite the fact that nearly all the inhabitants of the town knew that it was inevitably going to happen? The investigation of this murder takes the quality of a hallucinatory exploration into the past. The narrator's quest for the truth leads him into the darkness of human intentions, a truth that perpetually seems to slither away. This small masterpiece is one of the greatest classics of the 20th century.	2004-04-28

His wife Margot claims that men tend to get &quot;particularly band-tempered, pompous and demanding&quot; when they reach a certain age. Furthermore, one of his students nearly offends Adam when he states that he now looks anything like his picture on the back of his books. All this happens as Adam meets one of his admirers, Ralph, at a party. Ralph explains to Adam that some old - and rich - people are now having their living brains removed and transplanted into the bodies of young dead people. He assures him that the operation has already been performed successfully hundreds of times, as was the case on himself. Finally convinced by the numerous women eyeing Ralph at the party, Adam decides to undergo the operation and selects from a broad variety of dead corpses at the clinic the body of an athletic and very handsome young Italian footballer, settling for a &quot;short term body rental&quot; of six months. The outcome of the operation is successful and so begins for Adam - now Leo - a very surprising new life indeed.   Mr Kureishi's short stories are witty, incisive and funny. He is a keen observer of the human condition and he treats subjects like love, parenthood and the problem of happiness very skilfully.	2004-04-27

The events described in Mr Coetzee's novel are those which constitute the background and the action of Dostoevsky's &quot;The Devils&quot;.   Fyodor Mikhailovich, travelling under the name of Isaev, returns secretly to St Petersburg in October 1869. Having arrived at 63 Svechnoi Street, he meets Anna Sergeyevna and her daughter Matryona in their apartment. This is the place where is son Pavel Alexandrovich used to reside before his recent death. In deep grief, Fyodor Mikhailovich covers his face with his hands and tears run over his fingers as he discovers his son's room. &quot;I am the one who is dead, he thinks; or rather, I died but my death failed to arrive.&quot; Such are the thoughts that burden Fyodor Mikhailovich's mind as the hunger to talk about his son and to hear others talk about him rises in him. There is no one present to strike his hair, no murmurs of consolation in his ear.   Mr Coetzee places himself between known facts and Dostoevski's fiction, as Fyodor Mikhailovich seeks the truth about his son's death. Indeed, the circumstances of his death remain obscure because Pavel Alexandrovich was the member of a gang lead by Sergei Gennadevich Nechaev. This student anarchist movement became notorious for having murdered one of its own members...   A tour de force, Mr Coetzee's novel reflects on the relation of writers to events. It's also a touching account of a father's deep grief and his painful adjustment to the past of his son. A powerful, subtly written, superb personal testament.	2004-04-05

She's just lost a close friend, Hugo Baumgartner. When she gets back home, all that is left of Baumgartner's life are a few postcards sent by his mother during the Second World War. The German text on these postcards is always cryptic: &quot;Meine kleine Maus,&quot; &quot;Mein Haschen&quot; &quot;Liebchen...&quot; &quot;Do not worry, my rabbit, I am well. Are you well?&quot; &quot;Keep well, my mouse, and do not worry&quot; &quot;I am well...&quot; and they're signed &quot;Mama&quot;, &quot;Mutti&quot; or &quot;M&quot;.   And so the reader begins to follow Hugo Baumgartner's life, starting with his childhood in Berlin. At the age of about eight, his father, a Jewish furniture retailer, soon loses his business, his store is ransacked by the Nazis and he is taken to a concentration camp. Baumgartner and his mother are forced to leave their beautifully furnished apartment and hide in the former office of the shop. At school, Baumgartner's situation becomes unbearable: his classmates chant to him: &quot;Baumgartner, Baum, hat eine Nase wie ein Daum&quot; (Baumgartner's dumb, has a nose like a thumb.) Eventually, his survival in Germany becoming a matter of days, his mother agrees to Herr Pfuehl's idea to send his son to India, since he has a few connections there in the furniture production business.   There are many moving scenes as the reader discovers, along with Hugo, the sights, sounds and smells of Calcutta and Bombay. And moving too, the life of this pathetic and insignificant man Baumgartner who simply does not belong. Neither to Hitler's Germany nor to India's society, where he is a perpetual &quot;firanghi&quot;, foreigner, a wounded survivor.   This novel is the achievement of a superior writer with a sharp perception about human nature, loss, solitude.	2004-03-29

The city is described as &quot;smashed and dreary&quot; and when the action starts, Vienna is still divided up in zones among the Four Powers: the Russian, the British, the American and the French zones. Rollo Martins's line is the writing of cheap paperback Westerns under the penname of Buck Dexter. Martins received an invitation from Harry Lime of the International Refugee Office to join him in Vienna. When Martins arrives at the Hotel Asoria, there is no Lime expecting him, but only a cryptic message for Mr Dexter from a man called Crabbin. Martins then decides to look for Lime's apartment, but once he arrives there, a neighbour, a Herr Kurz, informs him that Harry Lime is dead after having been run over by a car. The burial is to take place the same afternoon at Vienna's Central Cemetery. Martins goes to the ceremony and immediately after that, he is accosted by a man called Calloway, a policeman from Scotland Yard, who asks him if he knew Harry Lime.   This is the beginning of Graham Greene's classic espionage thriller, very well constructed with wonderfully drawn characters and a suspenseful plot.	2004-03-24

Since being a high school senior, Jake has always been a passionate admirer and reader of Horace Jacob Little's fiction. This author is much talked about because he is famous for the strange circumstances of his personality, his seclusion and his solitude. In fact, since nobody has ever approached him, Horace Jacob Little is not much more than a fiction himself. His true identity is a mystery, not even his literary agents have ever met him since they only communicate with him via a post office box. All of his books only feature a blank cover. There are no illustrations, no biographies and no photographs of Horace Jacob Little. He has never granted an interview and no one knows what he looks like or where he lives.   One morning at Princeton university, Jake attends a lecture given by Professor Mullin about the works of Horace Jacob Little when suddenly a man inches up the side aisle, climbs onto the stage and, after a few confused sentences, identifies himself as Horace Jacob Little. But is it really him? Jake's startled and hyperalert classmate Andrew Wallace has no doubt about it: &quot;If this isn't Horace Jacob Little, then who is? Who is??   And so begins Jake's awkward search of Horace Jacob Little. Perhaps Andrew's &quot;Confessions&quot; which he wrote at the Overlook Psychiatric Institute - a place for the artistic mentally ill, a house full of painters, musician and writers - also called The Muse Asylum and in which he purports to reveal the secret of Horace Jacob Little's identity will be of some help for Jake...

He particularly likes taking pictures of taxi dancers working at the Aragon Ballroom where Herbert occasionally goes. And so he met Charlie Mortensen - also called Carla Marie LaBreque - and Ruby Fahey. Due to Herbert's eccentric way of life as a recluse, he doesn't feel very comfortable in the presence of women. All the photography sessions taking place at his apartment, Herbert's behaviour is always uneasy whenever a woman comes for posing. When Charlie Mortensen is found dead by strangulation on 30 Sptember 1939 and Ruby Fahey (killed in the same manner) on 22 October, the police suspect Herbert White and arrest him. Slowly White will be drawn into signing a confession stating that he killed the two women. But Lieutenant Wesley Horner becomes suspicious: why did Hebert White state in his confession that he killed the women &quot;by battery to the head&quot; when both of them died from strangulation?   Truth vs. fiction, past vs. present, love vs. hatred, faith and memory are the themes illuminated masterfully by Robert Clark.

The passion that develops between them, along with Calliope's failure to develop, leads Calliope to suspect that she is not like other girls. In fact, she is not really a girl at all but what the author calls the &quot;dritte Geschlecht&quot;.   The explanation for this surprising fact is a rare genetic mutation and a guilty secret that has followed her grandparents from Greece to Detroit and beyond, outlasting the glorious days of the Motor City, the race riots of 1967, and the family's second migration, into the country known as suburbia. Because of the gene, Calliope is part girl, part boy. And even though the gene's epic travels have ended, her own odyssey has only begun.

Henry Nanther became an expert in diseases related to blood, particularly haemophilia, of which some members of Queen Victoria's court suffered. Martin, wanting to write a biography of his great-grandfather, starts researching Henry's life and soon discovers that he was not just an expert in the matters of the blood but was virtually obsessed with it. Martin begins to suspect that his great-grandfather was less innocent about his work and life as he progresses through Henry's medical diaries and journals. It seems that he was trying to conceal something because the tragedies linked to haemophilia in his family do nor appear to be mere accidents. It may even be that they have implications for the blood doctor's descendant. It is Mrs Vine's fair achievement, though not her best book. Henry Nanther's story is lengthily interrupted by Martin Nanther's personal and marital preoccupations, so that the book would perhaps be more enjoyable if it were shorter.

His peroformance in &quot;The Blood Doctor&quot; is impressive and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to him.	2004-02-06

This book follows the author's &quot;The Talented Mr Ripley&quot; so that the reader is already acquainted with most of the protagonists like Dick and Chris Greenleaf, Bernard Murchisson or Tom's wife Heloise. When Ed Banbury and Jeff Constant, owners of the Buckmaster Gallery in London, decide to open a new show featuring paintings by the famous Derwatt, the situation becomes uncomfortable when the American collector, Murchisson, claims that a painting he bought three years ago is a fake. Knowing that Derwatt died years ago in Greece and that Bernard had been forging paintings by &quot;Derwatt&quot;, allegedly living in a remote village in Mexico, it will take all of Ripley's talent to clean the reputation of the Buckmaster Gallery, as Murchisson's visit to London is imminent. Mrs Highsmith's highly successful ingredients are all present in this novel: crime, horror, humour and suspense.   Nigel Lambert reading Patricia Highsmith's &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot; is a masterpiece. All the humour and suspense is rendered splendidly by Mr Lambert's beautiful reading.	2004-01-27

How could Mary's life have ended with such a tragic fate? As the reader progresses through the novel, he discovers Mary's insufferable existence, her life destroyed by a disastrous marriage to a farmer, Dick Turner. Mary is forced to live in a rural environment in South Africa for which she is ill-suited. Furthermore, Mary's relationship with her husband rapidly deteriorates as she realises that Dick is unable to manage the farm successfully and they are constantly on the verge of bankruptcy. A truly superb novel, tragic and moving to the very last line. Mrs Lessing's wonderfully captures Africa's majestic beauty, the difficult relationship between the whites and the Natives. The psychological portrait of her heroine is exceptionally intense.	2004-01-27

They are set in contemporary Bombay and other cities and they evoke the colours, sounds, smells and white-hot heat of Indian cities. The stories are peopled with intensely individual characters: there is a painter living in a slum who fills his paintings with landscapes, birds and flowers he has never seen. There is an American woman who turns to the hippies in the Indian hills because she is unhappy with her life in the verdant countryside of Vermont. There is a man spiritually transformed by the surface texture of a melon. And many more. It is a finely written, atmospheric, memorable collection of short stories. As always with Anita Desai, her work is warm, perceptive, both funny and touched with sadness.	2004-01-14

Two men, an architect, Guy Haines, and a psychopath, Charles Bruno, meet on a train to swap murders. Charles will kill Guy's wife Miriam and Guy will kill Charles's father. A chance meeting and a rash conversation will trap Guy Haines, almost against his will, in a nightmare. This is a cunningly plotted melodrama and I read it with thorough enjoyment. Alfred Hitchcock shot a film baring the same name and the movie is equally thrilling. Classic suspense is still the best in my view!   In this audiobook, Mr William Roberts reads Patricia Highsmith's &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; with plenty of enthusiasm and I enjoyed his voice very much. He manages to adapt his intonation beautifully according to the situation, at times tense, then hilarious, then serious again. A great performance.	2004-01-08

In this bizarre profession, he has to deal with leaks, security checks, tensions and suspicions. As Maurice approaches retirement, he realises that some of the decisions he made in the past are now having very serious consequences. In this beautiful novel, the reader discovers what the life of a secret agent is like: he is lonely, isolated and becomes almost neurotic. Greene lays bare a machine, the Secret Service, which overlooks Maurice's subtle and secret motivations that impel him. The characters are beautiful, full of tenderness, excitement and doubt.   Mr Tim Pigott-Smith's performance as a reader of Graham Greene's &quot;The Human Factor&quot; in this audiobook is truly stunning. His voice is very pleasant and his vivid reading adds a further dimension to this already excellent novel.	2004-01-08

The boy was surgically altered to live as a girl. For 25 years, John/Joan was described as a medical triumph, setting a precedent and a proof that our sense of being male or female is primarily a matter of environment and education than it is a matter of genetics. The case was however a failure because of the psychological costs which are only today coming to light. Currently living as an adult male with a family of his own, John (a pseudonym) reveals the horrid details of his childhood. Journalist John Colapinto's remarkable work and research produced a riveting story of science, courage and survival.	2003-12-19

She accounts of the suffering of her family who spent this period of time hidden in the Secret Annexe, just before being arrested on 4 August 1944. Although the &quot;Diary&quot; is now fifty years old, it remains in my view an astonishing and excruciating account of what Jews had to endure during the Second World War.

One is a Southern lawyer, the other is a rough-edged artist with a strong penchant for alcohol and the third one is a delightful aristocrat who is the closest thing possible to wickedness. Out of this reunion, William Styron has crafted a fabulous novel of rape, murder, suicide and deception with an insight of the dreadful persuasiveness of evil. The qualities of this novel are many, ranging from the sense of the striking scene, the fine art of the dialogue, the sharp depiction of cities, Italian scenery and interiors. William Styron is certainly one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. This is my favourite book by this author.	2003-12-17

Joyce was 25 when he wrote this miscellaneous collection of short stories, among which &quot;The Dead&quot; is probably the most famous.

In 1984 the world is divided into three parts, Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. These three parts are constantly at war. The charismatic figure of Big Brother stands in the forefront of the Party. It is a figure of mythical power. Winston Smith struggles against the Party, he rebels against Big Brother and the totalitarian regime. But his rebellion will result in his own destruction. We should bare in mind that this novel was published in 1949 and we so realise that Orwell's imaginary future world is a brilliant creation, his vision of brutalised and manipulated humanity is gripping and unfortunately still supremely relevant.	2003-12-11
