US	45175307	RBQYS6MSIEZN9	0525464921	754509866	Fire Bringer	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A UNIQUE READ!	I truly enjoy books that delve into what other creatures are thinking and doing, other than humans.  Clement-Davies thrusts the reader into the heart of a fantasy novel where deers, or Herla, as they call themselves, take center stage.  The book focuses around a young deer, Rannoch and an anciet prophecy that he must fulfill.  We follow Rannoch and his companions through rain and snow, wolves and rivers; Sgorr and his vicious Sgorrla.<br /><br />Some could liken this book to Watership Down.  However, the environment, characters, and plot are entriely different.  The author creates heroes you find yourself rooting for, and enemies you come to loathe.  The epic tale is one I will not soon forget and will reread with great vigor.	2005-10-07

Elizabeth Kostova got a 2million bonus for a book she had yet to complete.  For an author completing their first novel this was absolutely monumental!  I was stunned to say the least.<br /><br />Working at a bookstore I am surrounded by books all day long and I succumbed to the hype and bought the book.  The two weeks following my purchase were gruesome to say the least.<br /><br />Elizabeth Kostova for a break out writer is excellent at putting you in the time and place, painting a surreal experience for the reader.  I could tell every word was carefully chosen and crafted into wonderful sentences.  However despite the rare beauty with which Kostova constructs here sentences she lacks the necessary drive and curiosity a reader needs imposed upon to voraciously finish a book.<br /><br />The Historian is well researched and vividly written yet the story does little to pique the interest of the reader.  The characters as do the places come alive before your very eyes, but that is only half of what a book of this calibur should provide.  The entire book is a search for Dracula.  But what I was really disappointed in was the complete lack of Dracula who doesn't show up until the last 50 or so pages.  I began to get so bored with the book I had to read a couple others inbetween.<br /><br />Kostova is still a wonderful writer and this is a book that could be a great read for someone with an extreme amount of patience and with an interest in description as opposed to plot.  So if you're that person check it out if not read something else.	2005-07-08

For those of you who have enjoyed the two books prior to this one you will not be disappointed. Hearn delivers a superb finish to a literary tale rife with love, action, myth, betrayal, and revenge.  Takeo, the main character, must reclaim his birth right from the Otori Lords who have taken it from him.  With his meager army he must face enemies across all of Japan.<br /><br />Hearn creates a fantasical world yet cements the story in reality.  The sole element of the story which took away from it was the idea of a prophecy which basically ensured Takeo's success.

For most new authors plot is hardly a problem, its the character developement, setting the scene, and the use of vivid language that prove to be obstacles to the newly published writer.  However, Bishop proves just the opposite.  She paints a vivid picture of her world with words that would make your mouth salivate, your eyes captivate and your breath alleviate.<br /><br />Bishop languishes in beautiful descriptions of her characters and their surroundings.  She  wonderfully illustrates the metamorphosis many of the characters go through.  Her characters are extremely life like and wonderful to watch and develop.  Yet what are they developing for and why.<br /><br />The Etched City lacks any and all plot leaving the reader trapped in a labyrinth of description and development with no payoff.  There is no story only illustration.  I would love to return to Ashamoil again or revisit the characters of Gwyn and Raule but with no story there is no chance.

The past fifteen years have been witness to both negative and positive shifts in the American economy.  With the ever shrinking middle class, creating a larger gap between the rich and the poor, American industries are faced with either adapting to the consumer change or becoming extinct.  A fairly new trend, which can trace its roots back as early as the 1930's, is the \\"trading up\\" phenomenon.<br /><br />Michael Silverstein and Neil Fiske illustrate the American consumer's ever increasing need to create their individuality from the products they purchase, which creates a greater need for companies to specialize their product within their general market.<br /><br />American consumerism has little to nothing to do with purchasing what one needs but focuses solely on what one wants.  Trading Up is rife with stories from Callaway Golf to Victoria Secret and how each person had to take a risk in order to achieve the monumental success.  \\"Trading up\\" utilizes emotional engagement as an essential factor in creating and advertising a product.  The product must instill a sense of desire within the consumer enabling them to pay a high premium.  Yet, emotional engagement is only the beginning.<br /><br />Silverstein and Fiske refer to a \\"ladder of benefits\\", which are key factors in the \\"trading up\\" phenomenon.  The \\"ladder of benefits\\" reshape and provide new meaning to an product already on the market.  Through technical differences, superior functional performance and emotional engagement a company would be able to recreate an already existing product and sell it for a premium price.  Trading Up is an excellent book to lay the groundwork for a motivated, creative, and business savvy individual, who is ready to take their industry to the next level.

In Death by Meeting, Patrick Lencioni, tackles a challenging issue facing a multitude of companies, how to run an effective and efficient meeting.<br /><br />Lencioni does away with the \\"how to\\", \\"listen to what I say approach\\", but instead creates a business fable, where the company is fictional, but its problems are real.  The name of the fictional company is Yip, and Casey is the CEO.  Casey, despite being an innovative, creative, hard-working CEO lacks the skills to run an effective meeting.  As the fable continues Casey is faced with losing his job.  Yip goes public, and the company which bought them is thinking about replacing Casey.  It will take the hard work and research of a certain assistant and Casey to turn Yip's executive meetings from useless to productive.<br /><br />Lencioni uses his fable as a medium to illustrate how to effectively run meetings.  The strategy and formula Lencioni weaves within the tale are crucial tools many businesses need to implement to create a more sound and smooth meeting.  Lencioni understands the problems meetings can pose, and offers critical information on how to overcome those problems.  Save you and your business. Read Death by Meeting.	2004-11-15

Like Tony (the author)  I have searched my entire short life for faith and still continue to search.<br /><br />However the title of the book would lead one to believe that the books focus is on Father Joe, the title character, yet this is not true.  While Father Joe acts as a guide he is hardly in the book at all.<br /><br />Now I have little room to talk b/c I don't have anything published but I found Tony to go off on too many tangents and be very descriptive in his writing.  The first 40 pages of the book and the last 70 are exceptional, however the stuff inbetween is not needed.<br /><br />I enjoyed Father Joe, and loved learning about the life of Tony Hendra, I just wish there had been more interaction with Father Joe and less of a biography of Hendra's life.	2004-08-16

However, King's DT series remains invigorating and interesting to say the least and is a testament to Kings skill as a writer.  I have read many comments on how the climax of the final battle with the wolves was too short, but King stays true, the DT series is not focused on battling the wolves but on reaching the Dark Tower, the battle is one tiny step in a great journey and who could forget Roland's quote &quot;five minutes of blood and stupidity.&quot;<br />Wolves of the Calla is an excellent edition to the DT series and after I read it I was inspired to write my very own series, look for it appearing soon..NOT!

Another is when David Talbot is talking about how he once saw the devil and God conversing at a cafe.

There are too many characters within her story and most of them are underdeveloped.  The first hundred pages or so of the tale I was extremely confused as to what was going on.  I hadn't the slightest clue as to what Banks was writing about.  The dialogue was also extremely cheap and almost movie-like in nature.  However as the story progressed I found myself drawn to one character in particular, Carlos.  Banks does a wonderful job drawing him out and developing him into a complex character.  The story gets better towards the end but unfortunately ends on a cliff-hanger.  If you like horror books in general pick this up and read it, it's quick and semi-enjoyable.	2003-08-01

King does a superb job at composing a scary yet fun short story about a werewolf who attacks once a month when the moon is full.  King isn't trying to allude to anything and isn't tryiny to make any deep comments about society he is simply, with this story, writing to entertain, and he does it with vigor.  The story is easily read and enjoyable all the way through, check it out!  By the way the illustrations are excellent and bring the story to life before your very eyes!	2003-07-24

The language of the text can sometimes be hard to follow if you are not accustomed to reading literature from that time period, but the story is nearly flawless.  Lewis also places other characters of ill repute in the novel.  My favorite being the Head nun of St. Clare's, in my opinion she is more of the villain than the monk.  Throughout the tale the characters relate past tale's which can be tedious and boring at times, but do help to fill in any missing gaps the reader may have.  All in all Lewis wrote a dark tale which will continue to be read for centuries to come, and his contribution to the Gothic novel will never be forgotten.	2003-07-24

Let me first just say WOW!!!  Always have I wanted to find some kind of book which solely covers all the various material in the Dark Tower series, and Robin Furth has done just that.  This book covers ever little possible detail and nuance of the epic series that you could think of.  Not only does the author, Robin Furth, contain the infamous initials R.F., which appear in many of King's novels as the initials of an extremely \\"bad-dude\\" she, I would venture knows more about the Dark Tower Series than the man himself!  The amount of work put into this concordance is scary beyond belief, from the streets of the New York, to the path of the beams, and the interstate highway in Topeka, nothing is left out.  For anyone who is obsessed with the Dark Tower series like I am you will find this reference book an excellent source of information.<br />Furth carefully defines and describes all the major and minor characters and places, and then references them within the series.  For example, when describing the Tick-Tock man, the leader of the Grays, she references him within the series like so; III:298 meaning volume 3 page 298.  This is nothing short of amazing!  I have already read through the book a couple of times and now feel I am well prepared to receive \\"Wolves of the Calla.\\"  I highly recommend this book to all avid Dark Tower fans.	2003-07-22

The book covers shamanism cross culturally, so you get a taste of shamanism in Siberia (where it first originated) Africa, South American, North America, and many others.  Some of the information in the text may be a little dated or flawed, but if you are someone who is just getting interested in the area of shamanism I highly recommend it.  The text is easy to read, has vivid pictures, isn't too dry or boring, and doesn't spend an exorbitant amount of time on any one thing in particular.  In short it's a fun and interesting educational read.	2003-07-21

The main character, a nameless protagonist, is a black man who journeys from his southern college into the streets of Harlem.  Throughout the novel I found myself in the shoes of the character experiencing the fears, victories, and sorrows of the invisible man.  This novel is reminiscent of Uncle Tom's Cabin but then goes a step farther.  Ellison is able to weave a tapestry of thought and culture which each word upon the page.  The book is simpy engrossing and will open one's eyes to a whole new experience.  This isn't the type of novel you read but experience, so experience it for yourself.	2003-07-20

For anyone to understand and appreciate this literary masterpiece you first have to read A Game of Thrones, Book one of the Song of Ice and Fire series.  In his second installment, A Clash of Kings, Martin sets the stage for an epic struggle of a land in utter chaos.  Five people vie to become king of the Seven Lands.  Death, deceit, and betrayal are all major characters in this epic novel which will have you up all night and into the dawn reading until you are finished.  Every sentence is carefully crafted painting a vivid picture of a place both real and surreal.  One of the most intriguing aspects about the book is that the chapters are told from character point of views, so one learns to sympathize with all the characters regardless if they are villians or not.  There are so many characters you'll love to hate and many more you'll hate to love.  Martin has created an epic story which transcends the likes of Tolkien and pushes the envelope in fantasy literature.	2003-07-18

I read this book for a research project I was on doing Native American Shamanism and found this book extremely helpful.  Although it may not be a great literary work it is a wonderful source of information and insight into the rites of passage into becoming a shaman.  The author, Robert Lake has had a vast amount of experience in the field, undergoing the rites and rituals of the shaman as well as being an observer.  I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in Native American culture, especially shamanism.	2003-07-18
US	45175307	R7ITFTVFRQW	1585671827	95189240	Shardik	Books	5	3	3	N	N	An Epic Tale	Richard Adams knows how to create worlds of originality and complexity with ease.  Shardik is another one of his tales that thrusts the reader head first into a world of savagery.  Religion and how one deals with the issue of it is, in my opinion, the underlying theme of the novel.  Adams impresses upon the reader through his depiction of characters and events the negative role religion can have upon the individual and society.  The story is a riveting ride of emotions as the reader is swept from various cities across Adam's world.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy literature that has something to say about the human condition and how it interacts with the spirit and laws of religion.  Richard Adams is a spellbinding story teller with much to impart upon society.	2003-07-17

But it took a chronic illness to change him into the human being he is today.  His story about his bout with cancer is not one of great inspiration or motivation but of survival.  I finished the book the same day I started it.  It is a quick read and an invigorating tale of one man's struggle not only with a physical illness but a mental battle to overcome all obstacles.	2003-07-17

The world Bunch endeavors to create is nothing short of undeveloped and lacking any sort of ingenuity.  I felt he just sat down and randomly wrote until he reached a certain amount of pages and then decided to stop.  Was there even an editing process in this book?  I do not recommend this book to anyone unless they are looking for mindless empty drivel to fill their head.	2003-07-17

He introduces the reader to the first visitings of the world in which the Dark Tower is apart of.  King and Straub are excellent at sweeping the reader into the story and placing them at its very heart.  The character development is wonderfully displayed and the world(S) that are described come alive before the readers very eyes.  A must read for people who are fans are for people looking for an entertaining and excellent read!	2002-12-24
