Laura Restrepo's LA ISLA DE LA PASION is very hard to put down, as it is an excellent novel. <br /> <br />In the early 1900's, a Mexican soldier by the name of Ramon Arnaud is stationed at a tiny island in the Pacific, south of Acapulco.  He moves there with his wife and a few other people.  For all practical purposes, these people are stranded there, while life in Mexico goes on.   The Porfirio Daz dictatorship falls, a civil war breaks, and the country is torn apart by revolution. <br /> <br />LA ISLA DE LA PASION is a story of exile, with all its connotations, including the dream of returning.  Sickness, insanity and the force of nature play major roles in the novel.  Restrepo also exposes the reader to feelings such as true friendship, love, and loyalty. <br /> <br />Restrepo narrates the story almost 70 years after it actually happened, basically by contacting descendants of those involved. <br /> <br />From the perspective of form, the novel is very well written and easy to read, even as Restrepo jumps from past to present and also from city to city. <br /> <br />The plot is very interesting and the reader will always find himself wondering what will happen next and reading just a bit further before putting the book down. <br /> <br />The characters in the story are extremely well developed and you will end up understanding them, their feelings, dreams, scale of values, and fears.   <br /> <br />Apart from being basically a tragic character, Ramon Arnaud borders with being a caricaturesque and comical typical Mexican. <br /> <br />Even though in esence this is a sad story, there is also always a shadow of hope of returning home. <br /> <br />Restrepo also throws in a few elements of magical realism, which adds to the delight of reading this book. <br /> <br /> The only flaws I found were a series of typical Colombian expressions (Restrepo is Colombian), which Mexicans do not use or even understand, being said by the characters. <br /> <br />Overall, LA ISLA DE LA PASION is an excellent novel, even though in my opinion it does not reach the heights of Restrepo's DELIRIO. <br />	2005-05-10

LA HERENCIA DE ESZTER is yet another excellent piece of writing from Hungarian writer Sandor Marai. <br /> <br />Eszter, the main character and narrator, lives in a house which she inherited from her father.  She shares the house with Nunu, who has been her maid and main confident for many years.  One day, she receives a letter from and old friend, Lajos, who announces a visit after an absence of 15 years.   <br /> <br />Lajos, a dreamer, liar, poet and mainly a con man is responsible for Eszter and her family having lost most of what they owned. <br /> <br />Lajos' visit proves to be everything Eszter and Nunu expected it to be, and more. <br /> <br />The novel's main topic is the inevitable fulfillment of destiny, beyond reason, ethics and any type of moral code. <br /> <br />LA HERENCIA DE ESZTER is also a love story, a story of love that never was, and a story of love that could have been. <br /> <br />As in other of Marai's novels, the prose is beautifully written, and the book is very hard to put down.   <br /> <br />The main characters are profound and full of life.  The plot is well conceived and very nicely laid out. <br /> <br />As in EL ULTIMO ENCUENTRO , also by Marai, people rejoining after having been apart for extended periods of time, is one of the novel's main pillars.  He is able to not only understand but portray and expose human feelings that have been kept in the deepest corners of their souls for many years. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this novel.   <br />	2005-05-02

It is a horror novella, set in mid 18th century Russia.  At this time, the nobility practically owned the country, and they represented all economic and political power.  Throughout the book, the reader is exposed to russian culture, customs, and their very particular way of life. <br /> <br />As in most of what Dumas has written, the narration is absolutely beautiful, and the story simply flows and captures the reader. <br /> <br />The story starts with Dumas paying a visit to a town by the name of Makarief, where he is interested in visiting the Grubensky castle.  Once there, he finds a portrait of a young lady, who's face has been covered with black paint.  He decides to investigate and soon enough lays his hands of a manuscript written by Ivan Andreovitch, a peasant who worked for the Grubensky family. <br /> <br />Andreovitch narrates the series of incidents which lead to the curious painting, and crop-eared Jacquot is the main character, first hand witness to all that happened. <br /> <br />Even though this is a pretty short story by Dumas' standards, the reader gets a very clear picture of what life was like in 18th century Russia. <br /> <br />The plot is very well laid out and developed, and will keep the reader's full attention throughout the whole book. <br /> <br />There is not much character development, but then again, the book is less than 200 pages long. <br /> <br />Overall,  JACQUOT SANS OREILLES is a magnificent piece of gothic literature <br />	2005-04-28

REMBRANDT'S WHORE takes place during the second half of Rembrandt's life, in Amsterdam.  It tells the story of Hendrickje Stoffels, a 20 year old girl who moves in from the country, in order to serve as maid in Rembrandt's household. <br /> <br />Rembrandt has her pose for his paintings, and soon falls in love with her.  Because of a contract he has signed, regarding not being able to marry after his former wife's death, at the expense of having to pay a sum which he does not posses, he is not able to marry her, and thus she becomes his \\"whore\\". <br /> <br />From a historical perspective, we are exposed to war, the plague, religious intolerance, and politics.  All of these factors play important roles as they compose the background of the story. <br /> <br />The second half of Rembrandt's life was characterized by bankruptcy, illness, and his downfall from Amsterdam's best known painter to his being exploited by various political figures, who took advantage of his precarious situation. Hendrickje stands by him and provides him with care, emotional support, and a child, Cornelia. <br /> <br />It is because of her that Rembrandt is able to live, having lost his wife Saskia and children in a tragic manner. <br /> <br />The plot is well conceived and interesting. <br /> <br />I was unpleasantly surprised by the book's form.  REMBRANDT'S WHORE is basically a monologue by Hendrickje, sometimes in first person, and others in second, as she talks directly to Rembrandt.  Quite franky, the novel is often confusing.   <br /> <br />Also, due to the fact that  a 20 year old, practically illiterate, peasant girl narrates the story, the novel's flow is absolutely nonexistent.  This makes it difficult to read and quite franky boring. <br /> <br />I have read quite a few biographical novels regarding the lives and times of famous painters, and this one rank's pretty low, and cannot be compare this to other books of the same genre.  A specific example is Irving Stone's LUST FOR LIFE,about Vincent VanGogh.  Now, that's a masterpiece..... <br />	2005-04-28

WORLD SO WIDE is a pretty good book, and even though it's the first of Sinclair's novels I have read, it is understandable that he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1930. <br /> <br />The novel regards the life and times of Hayden Chart, a typical American living in Colorado during the post WWII years.  Chart's seemingly perfect life is suddenly shattered by the death of his wife in an automobile accident, for which cannot help but feel guilty. <br /> <br />When his wife passes away, Chart decides to run away to Europe, in an effort to reconstruct his life.  He winds up in Florence, where most of the novel takes place.  He has realized that all that he is, is a good architect, and apart from that his life is very empty. He had thought of himself as a well cultured person, only to realize that on the contrary, he is quite ignorant.  His circle of friends in Colorado consists of a group of superficial characters, from which he must run away. He makes up his mind to become a european history scholar, which he sees as a way to live a better life.  <br /> <br />In his process to relive his life, he meets Olivia, a cold hearted Italian history professor, with whom he falls deeply in love with. <br /> <br />While in Italy, he develops a relationship with the American colony, which is also filled with a set of pretty superficial characters. <br /> <br />The plot flows with much ease, and the 200+ pages are both involving and easy to read. <br /> <br />Chart, Olivia, and a few of the secondary characters are extremely well developed, humanized and extremely believable characters. <br /> <br />I would not consider the book to be a page turner, but none the less, it is definitely a novel worth reading. <br /> <br />Chart's effort to rebuild his life, his being exposed to real love for the first time, and his effort to survive in a new world, quite different from his own, provide for a few hours of entertainment. He never becomes a historian, but he is able to turn his life around.   <br />	2005-04-24

I have to agree with what most reviewers say about Camus' THE PLAGUE:  it is definitely not an easy book to read.  If I had to describe the book in a simple phrase, it would have to be something like: an existentialist account of a series of profound Dostoevskian characters facing the utmost adversity, a relentless plague, which is an allegory of the evil mankind faces on a daily basis.<br /><br />It is absolutely inevitable for me to compare THE PLAGUE with Jose Saramago's BLINDNESS, and the latter is, in my humble opinion, a much better novel.  Saramago's book is much less existentialist and in exchange provides a huge dose of magical realism.  It deals with a nameless and timeless city, where all of a sudden the population starts going blind, for no apparent reason whatsoever.<br /><br />Dr. Rieux, Camus' main character, is an atheist who apart from that lacks all type of passion and feeling.  He faces the plague in a cool and heartless manner, which simply does not touch me as a reader. Rieux represents a heavy combination of character complexity with an existentialist view of life.  He is the absolute anti-hero by definition.  Even though he is the one that takes the bull by the horns, he does it simply because he has to do his job.  There is absolutely no room for hope in this poor man's soul.<br /><br />As a Nobel laureate, one cannot ignore the fact that Camus is an excellent writer, but he also the type of writer which some people love, and others, like me, do not enjoy that much.  I guess one's opinion regarding THE PLAGUE has a lot do with the reason why one reads.  I read to enjoy myself, to be transported to other places and times, to feel, love, hate and hope with the characters.  I guess if I read the novel, rereading every single page and profoundly analyzing each thought and sentence, I'd have a more positive opinion of THE PLAGUE, but that's not the way I like to read....<br /><br />I like books which transmit passions, both positive and negative.  THE PLAGUE simply fell very short...egative.  THE PLAGUE simply fell very short... <br />	2005-04-15

I am used to the fact that whenever I pick up a book by a Nobel laureate, it's usually a pretty safe bet.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with Andre Gide's LAFCADIO'S ADVENTURES.  To be quite frank, I had a very hard time finishisng the novel.<br /><br />Lafcadio, the main character, has had a very hard life.  His mother went through a series of lovers, whom she made him call \\"uncle\\" every single time.  These men marked Lafcadio's life each in a different manner.  He turns out to be a poor man, both economically and emotionally.  All of a sudden he finds out he is the [illegal] son of a very rich man, and his life suddenly changes.  Combining his new situation with wit, imagination and a few perverse ideas, provides enough for what could have been an excellent plot and novel.<br /><br />Together with a close friend, he designs a scam, involving the supposed kidnapping of the Pope, to swindle rich people out of their money.  Although the book is supposed to be funny and very witty, I must admit I simply did not get it.  Boring is the first word that comes to mind.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, even the not-so-good books by Nobel laureates are usually above average.  In my opinion, not the case with LAFCADIO'S ADVENTURES	2005-04-12

Regardless of the fact that I'm not into psychological analysis, it was hard to put the book down.  I would not go as far as calling it a page-turner, though. It cannot however be compared to WHEN NIETZSCHE WEPT, also by Yalom, which is one of the best books I have read in quite some time. <br /> <br />The plot is well conceived, crafted and very interesting, and all the characters are neatly woven into it. <br /> <br />The novel evolves around the character of Dr. Ernest Lash, an analyst who based on an enconter with another analyst, Dr. Trotter, decides to experiment with his next patient.  The experiment consists of openning up to the patient and telling her nothing but the truth.  It is fair to say that even though their relationship was brief, Trotter changed Lash's life. <br /> <br />Yet another analyst, Dr. Marshall Streider, who happens to be Lash's senior analyst, is also heavily involved in the plot.  Streider represents the typical analyst, who is thus very critical of Lash's experiment, and is extremely concerned with practicing psychiatry in a much more conventional manner. <br /> <br />Even though LYING ON THE COUCH is 369 pages long, I was impressed by Yalom's character development.  All characters have depth and come to life in the book. <br /> <br />I cannot help but compare Yalom's writing to another contemporary and successful author, John Grisham.  One is a psychiatrist and the other is a lawyer.  Based on their experiences, they both decide to write novels based on their professions.  With all due respect for Grisham, it is my opinion that his books are quite commercial, whereas Yalom's books have more depth and quality. <br /> <br />This book will not change your life, or even leave you thinking about it for months (unlike WHEN NIETZSCHE WEPT!), but it is entertaining and worth the time. <br />	2005-04-06

However, as with Morrell's THE PROTECTOR, I was expecting more.  I've read most of what he has written, and his most recent books cannot be compared to his earlier ones. <br /> <br />LONG LOST is different from most of all his other novels, in the sense that the main character is not a bodyguard, spy or other type of super human caracter.  Brad Denning is a typical wealthy american, who is dedicated to his work and his family. He is, however  seriously affected by the fact that his kid brother was kidnapped 25 years before.  He feels responsible and has carried guilt with him practically all his life. <br /> <br />The plot is well laid out, and Brad Denning is a credible character. <br /> <br />The book is very easy to read and chapter after chapter you will simply want to go on, and find out what happens next.  The ending, which again never happened with most of his prior works, is rather predictable.  <br /> <br />If this book is compared to others of the same genre, it will definitely come out on top, but Morrell has set very high standards with his prior novels, and fans will be left with a bit of a sense of emptiness.   <br /> <br />Overall, the book is pretty good, and it's worth the time it takes to go through the 300+ pages. <br /> <br />I am starting to think that the muses of inspiration have abandoned Morrell, but since he still has to make a living, he continues to write.   <br /> <br />Being not only an avid reader, but also a music addict, I must say if I compare books to music, I had a similar feeling with U2, right after they released RATTLE AND HUM.  In my opinion, they put out quite a few weak albums, which people continued to buy simple because it was U2.   <br /> <br />Morrell has written so many good books, that I am willing to give him alast chance.  If his next book does not rise to my expectations, that's it for me and him. <br />	2005-03-17

In spite of the fact that most of the reviews I have read higly praise the book, it never really got to me. <br /> <br />The concept seems quite interesting at first:  an unknown russian, cardinal Kiril Lakota is elected pope.  After being held prisioner for quite a few years, he steps up to lead millions of people around the globe in a new world which he basically has knowledge of only from his years in captivity. <br /> <br />At the same time, Kamanev, the man who had been Lakota's prision guard in Russia, and who tortured him beyond belief, has become the head of the russian government. <br /> <br />The fact that both men now need each other provides for a very interesting plot, which in my opinion is never fully developed.  The main issue I have with the novel is that it is plotless...nothing really happens.  A large portion of the book consists of  a series of endless, and a bit boring, thoughts  from Lakota. <br /> <br />On the other hand, the reader is exposed to the way the catholic church funtions and thinks, which is an interesting way to humanize religion in he eyes of the reader. <br /> <br />There are also a series of sub-plots dealing with what Lakota has to face as a pope, regading human cruelty, poverty, and most of all politics, which could have proven to be enough for a good novel. <br /> <br />Unfortunatelly, the narration goes astray in many parts, which lessens one's interest in the book. Quite frankly, I had to make a great effort to finish the book, hoping that at some time it would pick up, which it never did. <br /> <br />As I mentioned before, West is a very good writer, but this book is in my opinion, highly overrated.  I can honestly say it never got my full atention. <br />	2005-03-14

Wells is, without a doubt, gifted with both imagination and the abilty to write.  FIRST MEN ON THE MOON is a very good read; it is well written, fast-paced, and the plot is most definitely intriguing. <br /> <br />What you get out of this book, in my opinion, depends highly on your expectations of it.  If you're looking for sci-fi written in 1901, and you want to be amazed by Wells as a visionary of things to come, this is not your book.  With the exception of a lunar landing, none of the \\"scientific\\" developments or discoveries created and described by Wells exist nor in all probabilities will ever exist.  This is the main reason why Jules Verne advocates place him well above Wells.   <br /> <br />On the other hand, if what you want is a book that's easy and fun to read, with a plot that makes it hard to put the book down, then you're in for a treat.  Even though most of what Wells has written is pretty dense and by no means considered easy to read, this novel is. <br /> <br />As with many other writers in Victorian England, Wells is very influenced by his world and surroundings.  You will find (both on earth and on the moon!), that society is clearly divided into social classes, and it is definitely not Well's intention to disturb this normal \\"order\\" of things.   <br /> <br />Each of the two main characters represents a different victorian current of thought.  While Cavor is a true scientific mind, and his main concerns are truth, mankind, and a better world overall.  Bedford is more adventurous and daring, and his main concerns are himself and his own wealth.  In a way, neither ever understands the other, as they are blinded by their own view of the world.   <br /> <br />In summary, FIRST MEN ON THE MOON is definitely worth the time it takes to cover the 180+ pages, and when you put it down you will be left with a feeling of satisfaction..... <br />	2005-02-15

If what you're looking for is a profound, meaningfull novel, with extreme depth in the characters, this is not for you.  Manfredi is not (and does not try to be) Joyce, or Dickens, or Garca Mrquez. <br /> <br />As simply a piece of historical fiction, as is also Alexander (trilogy by Manfredi), I think this is a pretty good read. <br /> <br />The story is mainly narrated by a druid, who, years after the action took place, wants to leave testimony of how things happened. It is the year 476 AD and a handfull of legionaries, belonging to the last existing roman legion, accompanied by a couple of quite picturesque characters, embark in a very intense adventure.  They continuously find themselves in life threatening situations, which they sort out in diverse and imaginative ways. <br /> <br />This is a story full of of adventure, fraternity, honor, loyalty, love, and even magic, which is difficult to put down.  I consider it to be just fun, relaxing reading.  At the end, you are left with a warm, satisfying feeling.   You will not however, be left pondering the meaning of your own existence.... <br /> <br />What makes this novel unique is in my opinion, the amount of research that went into it.  It ties up nicely to historical and common mythical events, which makes it worth your time.  I guess it is to the reader's advantage that Manfredi is not only an archeologist, but a highly regarded and reknown history professor.  <br /> <br />As with other Manfredi books, the plot is interesting, and the book is very well written, even though one is to assume something is probably lost in the translation from Italian. <br />	2005-02-14

I have very mixed feelings about it, which in itself is not that uncommon, except for the fact that these feelings are diametrically opposed to each other.  How do you review and rate a book when you both loved and hated it?<br /><br />On one hand, Heller is without a doubt a superb writer, and Bob Slocum is a profound, complex, and extremely real character.  The novel is very well written and allows you to dive deeply into Slocum's mind and also into his (lack of) soul.  There is a certain hypnotic effect that takes place as you are getting to know Slocum.  At times, Heller helps himself by developing Slocum through repetition.  Many times will themes, dialogues, and ideas be repeated, which may become boring to some extent.<br /><br />On the other hand, this novel left me with a sense of complete emptiness.  In my opinion a good book is one that makes you feel strong emotions, regardless of whether they are positive of negative...so strictly by my own definition, this is a good book.  How rewarding is it?  Very little....<br /><br />Regarding the book's plot, it is practically nonexistent.  I would not have liked to have to write a book report on Something Happened, and be expected to complete a section or chapter called Plot!<br /><br />To be quite frank, with Heller's reknown wit, I was expecting a more humorous book.  This turns out to be one of the saddest books I have read in a long time.  Slocum is the kind of person that nobody wants to be but a whole lot of people turn out to be.  He doesn't love, or need, or cherish, or value anything.  He is truly a character without a soul.<br /><br />Is the novel worth the time you have to put into the 560+ pages?  I'd have to reluctantly say.....yes.<br /><br />I've read many books which try to satirize the american dream and the modern way of life, but this one goes too far.  However close to real life this book may be, I like to think my son will grow up in a world where the imense majority of people laugh, love, dream  and care deeply about someone or something....<br /><br />Finally, if you're depressed, wait until you're happier to pick up this book....it may develop suicidal tendencies.hink my son will grow up in a world where the imense majority of people laugh, love, dream  and care deeply about someone or something.... <br /> <br />Finally, if you're depressed, wait until you're happier to pick up this book....it may develop suicidal tendencies. <br />	2005-02-05

It must not be a coincidence then that this is among his shortest novels.  I suppose this is why at times, his characters wind up being caricaturesque, and not as complex and real as some of his other very memorable characters.  By the same token, some of his subplots do not fit in to the main plot the way they do in most, if not all, of his other works. <br /> <br />Dickens is trying to explore and provide us with a picture of the effects of utilitarianism on different types of human characters, and in my opinion he does a good job, but only as far as individuals go.  We can see the impact of the post romantic victorian social system on all of the novel's characters, and this makes the book interesting.  The downside, however, is that when Dickens tries to extrapolate and paint a picture of the social struggle going on, he falls quite short.  He tries to oversimplify too much, and in my opinion, fails at that. <br /> <br />The \\"nothing but Facts\\" system psychologically castrates most of the main characters in the book.  In one way or another, they all have their share of \\"Hard Times\\", and this can surely be attributed to a dehumanizing system, where people are statistics or simply gears within the machine which represents the newly industrialized world. <br /> <br />It is no surprise that there are absolutely no happy people in this novel.  This is definitely not one happy book, but overall it's really worth reading.  If what you're looking for is a book that easy to read and to understand, and a page-turner, just stay away--read John Grisham instead ;-).   If you want to read Dickens, this is more that probably not his best, but it's still good.   <br />	2005-01-28

The shock of being exposed to a different type of thought process and thus narrative, is absolutely overwhelming.    There are a lot of things you learn from Christopher Boone, and I went through the 250+ pages in very few hours.    If I were to describe the book in one word, it would have to be \\"crude\\".  It is really mindboggling to be exposed to autism, and to the extremely starightforward and single purposed mind of Christopher.    The book is truly one of a kind.    At times it made me angry, anxious, desperate, impatient.... A book that can transmit one of these emotions had fulfiled its purpose.  A book that generates such a turmoil of emotions and feelings is definitely worth reading.	2005-01-22

This book was written by Sandor Marai more than 50 years ago, in Hungary, and was banned.  It was then published in 1999, and in 2004, its 23rd edition was published.  This itself made me pick it up.  A book that has been edited 23 times in 5 years must have something..... <br /> <br />El Ultimo Encuentro deals with a couple of old men, who were absolutely inseparable during their younger years, and are now meeting again, after not seeing or hearing from each other in more than 40 years.  The entire novel revolves around the mysterious reason why they separated. <br /> <br />Life, friendship, loyalty and truth are deeply explored in the meeting between these two men, who in spite of not having any type of contact in 40 years, have thought about each other every single day of their lives. <br /> <br />The book is beautifully written, and is very hard to put down. Two men are bearing their souls, dreams, and memories.... <br /> <br />In some ways, El Ultimo Encuentro reminds me of Hermann Hesse's writings.... <br /> <br />Definitely worth your time.	2005-01-21

Sylvester Bonnard personifies good and innocence, to the point that even as an elderly scholar he is most of the time perceived as a little boy. <br /> <br />It is not a simple task to develop a character in such depth, in less than 200 pages.

US	52661735	R199MMVATU07TN	0618154612	727433108	The Age of Napoleon	Books	5	16	18	N	N	Excellent.....	Herold approaches Napoleon in a very different manner, if compared to other authors.  While it is true he does not concentrate on military strategy or on the battles per se, he gives us a very clear view of what was going on around in Napoleonic times. <br /> <br />This history book concentrates more on ideas than on anything else.  You're given a picture of what was happening all around the world, at least from an ideological perspective. <br /> <br />I also find it quite usefull that he dedicates separate chapters to the different empires (Prussia, Russia, Spain, Britain....), so the book is not simply a chronological set of events.  He is not afraid to go back in time to let us understand a particular subject, and then in the next chapter go back in time again, but concentrating on a different matter. <br /> <br />The book can't be considered too easy to read, but then again, it's not a novel, it's a pretty complete history of Napoleonic Europe.  As a matter of fact it's probably the best one I have gotten my hands on. <br /> <br />The book is very well documented, and it goes into a bit of detail when explaining the sources so you come out with a basic knowledge not only of who wrote what about Napoleon, but much more importantly WHY. <br /> <br />The last part is a summary of what happened after Napoleon, in the times of Napoleon II and Napoleon III, which I also found useful.  It helps you situate Napoleon within the history of France. <br /> <br />Overall, it's an excellent book and I would recommend it for people who want a good insight into the age of Napoleon.	2004-12-06

This book is a pretty organized and concise biography of Napoleon. <br /> <br />Regarding form, it is written sort of as an outline, so it carries at least one subtitle per page, which at first as a bit annoying, but I got used to it.  Another important characteristic is that the book is packed with quotes and most of them are very adequate for what is being discussed at that moment.  A lot of research went into the bio. <br /> <br />Juan van den Eynde, quite a few times during his narration, takes sides against Napoleon, passing judgement too often.  It is my opinion that a good biographer lays out fact and opinion, so that it is the reader who eventually passes judgement on the subject, and forms his own opinion.  There are passages where you feel Eynde really hates Napoleon's guts. <br /> <br />In summary, the book is good and worth the time it takes to go through the 188 pages, but as a an introduction to Napoleon and his times.  Naturaly, the author does not provide detail about any of the important account in Napoleons life....	2004-11-28

Alain Lausard is the main character of Howard's novel, which deals with Napoleon Bonaparte's Egyptian campaign.  The novel covers about 2 years, since Napoleon left France (Toulon) and sailed for Malta and Egypt, until the invaders had been basically stranded for more than a year in Egypt. <br /> <br />The novel does not in any way concenrate on Napoleon himself, but on a group of soldiers, all of which were recruited after being incarcerated in Paris.  It depicts the hardships these soldiers went through as they crossed the Mediterranean, made a stop in Malta, and continued for Egypt, where they were not received as Napoleon expected, as liberators, but as invaders. <br /> <br />The book contains pretty gruesome descriptions af battles, massacres, rapes, all of which became common for the expeditioners.  The french army's main enemies were not the Bedouins or the Mamluks, as expected.  Hunger, desperation, mutiny, thirst and the plague were the real enemy. <br /> <br />It is written in a simple language, and is easy to read.  It's worth the time it takes to go through the 260+ pages. <br /> <br />	2004-11-27

It does not go into detail and leaves out particularly interesting passages of Bonaparte's carreer, such as some of the battles and in particular Auterlitz.   <br /> <br />As can be expected, if you have read about Napoleon before, you will be left with a sense of emptiness, as some critical and crucial events are covered in a single paragraph. <br /> <br />The only major shortcomming of the book is that it practically ignores Napoleon's relationship with women (Josephine, Marie-Louise)which as we all know is key to understanding Napoleonic history.   <br /> <br />The book is very well documented and overall presents a very nice introduction to Napoleon.  Also, it is easy to read....	2004-11-24

I say surprisingly, because most of the biographies I have read become tedious, slow, and boring at times.  Definitely not this one. I devoured the 650 pages in a couple of days. <br /> <br />It is superbly written, in the form of a novel, which makes it extremely easy and enjoyable to read.  I was amazed by the multitude of sources consulted and cited by Castelot, in order to make the biography as complete as possible.   <br /> <br />It covers Napoleon Bonaparte's entire life, and chapter by chapter the reader's interest is not only captured but maintained.  It's the type of reading that just makes you want to find further readings on the subject. <br /> <br />It draws a clear picture of Napoleon the soldier, the statesman, the lover, but above all, the man.  You walk away with a feeling of completeness, which seldom happens when you read biographical novels, which usually concentrate on very few aspects of the character being presented.  <br /> <br />The only criticism:  Too many times, when writing about a specific place, Castelot mentions the house/room/other place still exists, which in my opinion is irrelevant, this book being in the form of a novel.  <br />  <br />If you get your hands on it, don't let go of it.  It's really worth it....	2004-11-19

Since Colombia is \\"el pais del olvido\\", reading this can be very disturbing.  <br /> <br />It feels strange to read the past few years' newscasts thrown together into a single volume.  It makes you realize what a horrible situation Colombia and colombians have gone through. <br /> <br />She sometimes goes into too much gruesome detail on masacres and killings, but the overall picture is clear.   <br /> <br />It's a good thing that she lets you know right away that she supports leftist ideas.  Had she not done this since the beginning, her being so biased might become boring in the middle of the book. <br /> <br />She sometimes loses track of a story and jumps right into another one, only to leave it and jump back, which is sometimes difficult to cope with, but overall he book is prety good. <br /> <br />I guess if you're not colombian, as I am, and are interested in Colombia, this book provides an accurate description of he past 50 years of our \\"macondian\\" country.  However,if you want to learn about Colombia, Garcia Marquez is much more fun...... <br /> <br />The only point she totally misses, is mentioning the age of the combatants......15 in average!	2004-11-10

An autobiogaphic novel of a chinese writer during Mao's Cultural Revolution....    The book deals with the thoughts, happenings and loneliness of one man, who struggles to find himself in the middle of political and culural turmoil in China.    Nothing is good or bad, everything is simply different shades of gray.  What's acceptable one day is punishable the next.  Nobody wants (dares) to take any type of political stance, in a changing world.    Anxiety and vulnerability are in every single paragraph, as the writer is obcessed with finding the meaning of life in casual sexual experiences.    Everyone is forced to wear a mask, which allow them to blend in to the everchanging panorama of things. Identity is nonexistent.    Regaring form, the book jumps not only from time to time, back and forth, but is also narrated in second and third person, which complicates things a bit.     As Gao clarifies during his Nobel acceptance speech, he wites for himself, and by doing so, provides an insight into twentieth century maoist China.    In summary, a bit heavy....	2004-11-03

One Hundred Years of Solitude is definitely my favorite book of all times.  Since I considered I had read Gabo's masterpiece, I never got to reading Love in the Times of Cholera, until now.   <br /> <br />A few days ago, I read Memoria de mis Putas Tristes, which came out about a week ago, and when writing a review, I thought too bad the book is not 900 pages long.  Then, hungry for more divine prose and magic realism, I remembered Love in the Times of Cholera.  I suddenly had 500 more pages of Gabo. <br /> <br />The book turns out to be a 50+ year long love story, superbly written as most of what Gabo has written.  The prose grabs you and does not let you go until the very last line.  <br /> <br />Every now and then, one reads a sentence in a book and wonders how much feeling, effort, expeience and luck it takes to word something so beautifully.  This does not happen too often, and sometimes you go through numerous books without finding one of these, regardless of who the author is.  Well, let me just say that there is one of theses magical sentences in just about every single page of Love in the Times of Cholera.  The novel is like a bottle of excellent wine....each sip tastes better than the last one.  This book will leave you with a sensation od deep, pleasant intoxication. <br /> <br />How does it compare to One Hundred Years?  It's simply different.  Even though time is probably the main character in both novels, while there's more magic in One Hundred Years, there's more love and passion in Love in the Times of Cholera.   <br /> <br />I am left with the exact same feeling after reading every one of Gabo's boks:  how the hell does he do it every time? <br /> <br />Don't miss out on the pleasure produced by this novel.	2004-10-27

A very emotionally charged story, with strong and well defined characters, all of which remain nameless throughout the novel. <br /> <br />You will find yourself inmersed in the devastation, horror, and chaos..... transported to this city of the blind, sharing their troubles, fears, and feelings. <br /> <br />Saramago's narrative is superb.  Very few authors can get away with mixing description, comment and dialogue in a sigle sentence, aided only by the use of mostly commas. <br /> <br />This is really a superb book, which will be enjoyed by both Saramago advocates and also by people who have not read Saramago before.	2004-09-14

At first, the plot seems interesting and well conceived.  However, as she starts jumping around historical periods, following the trace of the sheet with which the body of Christ was covered and on which the image of Christ miraculously appears, the plot goes astray.  Too many characters, and very few of them are fully developed.    She tries to cover too much in 500+ pages....Knights Templar, a couple of french kings, Constantinople....and so on.  The book does not involve you in any way.  Definitely not a page turner.....      Not to ruin the book's ending, suffice it to say that one of the greatest misteries in history is resolved in an extremely simplistic manner.

The other chapters (puberty, teens, leaving home.....) were not very interesting, for me at least. <br /> <br />I now think that if you want to read about being a father, you should look for a book dedicated to fathers with kids the age of yours.  In other words, the book is way too ambitious. <br /> <br />It has to be very difficult to describe what it is to be a father, of children of absolutely any age, and have people relate to the reading. <br /> <br />The book makes a few good points about kids the same age as mine and I enjoyed it, but it tries to summarize too much in just a few pages. <br /> <br />Still, an OK book.   <br /> <br />	2004-07-22

I was in for a very pleasant experience.<br />Regardless of the fact that the book is in many passages written in a &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; manner, the characters have life and depth.  It is amazing the way the different stories are tightly woven together.<br />I think a great book is one that not only conveys clear images, but also emotions.  You cannot help but feel a deep impact by the emotional situations and stress of the characters in this novel.<br />You will find yourself devouring this book to see how the whole plot plays out and how all the character's stories tie together at the end.<br />As another reviewer said.

The author builds up a situation or conflict, only to resolve it in very few paragraphs, and to a certain extent in very predictable ways.

It is adventurous, fast paced and written in a superb manner.  <br />This book is a true delight and it is very hard to put down.  It is one of Dumas' lesser known pieces, and has not been published anywhere in quite a few years so it was not easy to find before this new hardcover edition.<br />Trust me on this one.  It's really worth it.	2003-10-29

When you walk into a bookstore and go to the history section, and look for latinamerican history, you will find this book there.  It is absolutely outrageous that this book is sold as if it were titled &quot;A History of Colombia&quot;.<br />Kidnapping is a phenomena that has plagued Colombia for some time now, as it provides the economic means for the civil war in Colombia. However, kidnapping is not the axis our major point of our history.<br />This very well written book is an account of a kidnapping from the inside.  Gabo actually spoke to the people this happened to, and penned it nicely.  This book is sad and reflects a reality which should only exist in nightmares.<br />Worth it.	2003-10-23

This is without a doubt one of the top 20th century novels, and as such, very much has been written about it.<br />Some clasify it as an epic, while others try and find all the symbolism and deep meaning behind the story of Macondo and the Buendía family.<br />Let me just say that more than a great novelist, García Marquez is a great observer.  As a colombian, I can honestly say that the events depicted in this well written novel are not as far away from our reality as might seem at first. Things like the ones descibed here do happen in small &quot;conteño&quot; (from the coast) towns throughout Latinamerica in general.<br />I am sure that for quite some time Gabo had a laugh at the expense of all who searched for the real and inner meaning of Cien Años de Soledad, and who wrote innumerable pages full of interpretations.<br />This book is simply the story of a town as told by a grandmother to her grandson.<br />You either love this book or you hate it, and if you hate it, it's because your world is too small and simple and you do not have the imagination it takes to understand this as an account of my &quot;bananero&quot; country's reality.<br />Do not miss this book.	2003-10-23

Many people have written about dictatorships in latinamerica.  Suffice it to say that this is one of the better ones.  I love Garcia Marquez, but I think this book is better than his Autumn of the Patriarch.<br />Naturally, if you have the chance to read the Spanish original version, much better.  However, the current translation is very good.	2003-10-23

This is one of his first writngs and I also consider it one of his best novels.<br />Together with Rulfo's Pedro Paramo, Azuela's Los de Abajo, and Allende's Como Agua Para Chocolate, one of the finest pieces of Mexican literature.	2003-10-23

However, for some reason I found this book extemely difficult to read.  Too much magical realism, if you ask me.  I gave it quite a few shots and failed miserably.<br />I recommend that before you bite into this one, you read some other books of his.	2003-10-22

If you can chose between the single volume and 4 volume versions, go for the later.  It is definitely worth your time.

If you pick this book up and are exposed to GGM for the first time though this, his memoirs, you will be bored to death, let alone clueless about what he is writing about.<br />For us GGM addicts, this book is another stroke of GGM's genius.  You'll learn about the though process of the genius who practically invented magic realism.	2003-10-21

Without a doubt Howard knows a lot about WWI, but he does not write in a way that I can enjoy reading him.  It took me a long time to finish this book and came out pretty empty handed.  James Stokesbury (A Short History of WWI) tackles the job superbly if you want an introduction to WWI.	2003-10-21

The fact that Yalom is a psychologist and not a novelist has become the most common criticism of this book.  However, I found it very interesting.  Few times are fact and fiction so carefully intertwined to produce a book that makes you think about your existence and how you dealt / deal / will deal with it after reading the book.	2003-10-14

To me, this is a vulgar attempt at a latinamerican Harry Potter-ish novel of adventure.  You want to know what's even worse?  There's a sequel out.  I saw it and I couldn't believe it.<br />I guess Allende acted like those rock stars that reach their peak and then think they can sell any garbage they put out....and sometimes do.	2003-10-14
