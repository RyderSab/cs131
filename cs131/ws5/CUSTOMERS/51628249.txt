I love this book for the simple fact its got not one, not two, but three villains.  Aside from my fave, Palpatine, it introduces another, Prince Xizor who dares to go up against another fave Lord Vader.  Its an action packed book with lots of scheming, dirty dealings and fighting scenes.  The glimpses into Vader's thoghts was a real treat and I was glad to see that the ending left you guessing a bit.  A great addition to the Star Wars saga.  Anthony heald who is my favorite narrator in audiobooks does a fantastic job bringing each character to life; using sound effects i.e mechanical  breathing when Vader was speaking was a nice touch and you got to love Xizor's theme which plays throughout this great audio production; one of my top audiobooks in my collection and one which has given me countless hours of listening enjoyment.  Highly recommended.	2001-08-02

While the overall premiss was all right the story just got to be too corny for my liking.  give me a break every victim survives?  Okay maybe one dies but the return of Megan's boyfrined was beyond fiction.  The only character which i cared about in this whole production was Matthews himself and I'd wish he had killed Tate in the end.    In my opinion it would have been just.  Still, we have to have our predictable endings all tied up in a nice bow.  No a complete bore and the RLV (repeat listening Value) of this audiobook is poor.  Don't buy it but borrow it or rent it.  Not a great thriller I'll stick to James Patterson from now on.  Not recommended.	2001-07-20

The stories in this collection are scary, and some will down right give you the creeps but as you listen on, you start to notice that each story is more or less like the last just altered a bit and given a new title.  Simply put there are too many &quot;the dead come back&quot; stories in this anthology for my liking.  Horror stories can be so much more.  How about a Psycho or haunted song or haunted music store even.  there was none of that.  There were a lot of dead rockers coming back to kill or avenge and again some of the stories were truly frightening.  My rating is actually 3.5 stars but it would have easily gotten 5 if there was more variety to it.  It is read by various readers including Joan Jett which in my personal opinion should stick to singing.  Her flat delivery does nothing for me.  I'm glad the stories weren't sugar coated and that there were swear words abound.  Drugs and sex of course were mentioned often though all were heterocentric, more variety there would have been nice as well.  Overall, a good audio production I would recommended and it does come with a bonus cassette filled with rock songs.	2001-07-17

Butterfly (Library Edition Audio CDs) (Audio Theatre Collection)	Books	5	8	9	N	N	A great production	This audiobook presentation of M Butterfly will give listeners a first class seat to hear one of literature's great stories.  M butterfly is much more then a love story; rather it is a multi-themed tale which addresses many issues.  West vs East, Fantasy vs reality sexuality, true love and the human condition.  John Lithgow and B. D. Wong are great in the leading roles, especially Wong what a transformation!  Buy this production and enjoy this mind's eye treat.  L.A theatre works did  an excellent job in putting it all together and I will not hesitate to buy more of their audio products.  Thank goodness Amazon carries a large selection!

James Luceno is fast becoming one of the top writers in the SW universe.  Palpatine simpley shines in this novel as he subtly influnces everyone to do his bidding even though no one suspects him of doing so.  Even the Jedi council is at a loss on who is truly behind all the political upheavl.  This book clearly explains the reason behind the taxation in Ep, 1 and gives much needed backround developments.  It was refreshing to read or in this case listen to a SW book that didn't focus so much on the shoot-em-ups but on plot and character development.  Being a palpatine fan, i devoured this book and hope more in this style will be written.  The early years are truly worth reading about.  It was also exciting to see the members of the Jedi council get off their lazy behinds for once and take part in the action, though i didn't much care for a female version of Yoda.  This book is a must read if one is to fully grasp the events of Ep, 1 and the upcoming Ep, 2.  On a personal note however, this book demonstrates how flawed Return of the Jedi was even though I've seen it about 500 times.  Palpatine is such a master not just of power but of manipulation and strategy that it was hard to swallow the empires defeat, though the ending of the film is great. Random house audio once again did a superb production and Alexander Adams read the book nicely, even doing better with it then the previous one Edge of Victory 1, Conquest.  I can't wait to see more of Palpatine in action but alas I will have to settle for enjoying the next installment in the equally brillaint New Jedi Order series which is the next one up.  Highly recommended.	2001-06-18

On the whole, this box set is great.  Most stories are well acted and of course have suspense!  One anoying thing about this collection is the inclusion of the dumb autolight commercial between shows but by the tenth cassette the comercial is gone.  Like the reviewer below me, a collection of this size is bound to carry a few duds but I would say that there are only three or four in this entire collection.  Most are quite intriguing and well written.  Its worth mentioning that comparing these stories with today's pop culture and morals is amusing though I was rather surprised that they tackled themes like divorce, adultery and even alcoholism; pretty progressive stuff for those days.  For the price, you can't go wrong.  If you are a lover of classic radio drama or audiobooks in general its worth every penny and they will give you hours of enjoyment.  Highly recommended.	2001-06-10

I can't understand why some fans don't like this plotline; personally I think its one of the best.  Conquest was a great book in that it reveals more of the Vong culture and its citizens it also shows that all Vong do not share the warmaster's views or agenda.  Two casts are introduced in Conquest, the shamed ones, those who's bodies could not withstand the sacrifices needed by the Gods and the Shapers, those who mould other spiecies into serving the Vong through brainwashing.  Its Anakin's show; who is on a mission to rescue Tahiri from the clutches of the Vong shapers before she is completely brainwashed.  The story itself is suspenseful enough but this novel also soes the seeds of a way to fight back against the Vong; Anakin learns of some great insights and I'm  sure in Rebirth he will use them to good use.  Still, I think it was a tad too soon to start turning direction concerning the Vong but I hold out hope that the Vong will strike back with avengenes before they are defeated.  Then again, things might not go as the fans predict the series is only in its seventh book and anything can happen.  I wish there was one every month instead of every three.  Anyway I'm looking forward to Cloak of Deception which goes back in time and stars the other Anakin; excellent series I have all novels to date Amazon can't ship them to me fast enough.  highly recommended.	2001-04-15

No doubt about it, Clive Barker has got what it takes to write great horror.  these four short stories stir the nerves and haunt the mind.  this is edge of your seat terror which wont allow you to stop reading till its over.  Having bought the audiobook edition, I found myself glued to my headphones listening to each creeping story.  From creatures hidden in knots to sexual lust out of control to body parts bent on destruction this book has it all; if all horror books would only have these elements it would be great.  The narrator Dillinger Steele did a pretty good job at reading the book but since most of the stories took place in London he failed to inject any hint of a british accent.  His southern one kind of muddles up the voice of the characters at times but he does not shy away from doing his best to give the listener the gory details.  A great book to add to a horror fans collection or an audiophile's one.  Highly recommended; now I want to buy In the flesh.  By the way, Amazon is practically the only etailer which has the audio versions of these books still on hand; get them before they're gone!	2001-04-05

Amazon recommended this series to me based on my purchases and after putting it off for a long time I went ahead and tried it out.  I liked it.  The story is good, fast moving and has suspense and action like a Star Wars novel.  Kane and Grant are likable characters and for a while there I thought were more then just friends, who knows?  Bridget looks like Mara Jade Skywalker's sister and is sexy and tough.  The villains are a mixture of human and alien and control the various cities that have surfaced after the destruction of Earth.  Basically the story takes place two centuries after a nuclear war has destroyed most of earth and has left it a wasteland.  However humanity or some form of it has returned but is entirely  controled by mysterious rulers known as Barrens.  Those who are useful and do not have any defects live within the cities, those who are not and are deformed in some way live in the outlands, but things are not that simple and for Kane and Grant who are part of the Barren's police force they are about to discover terrible secrets.  If you like Sci-fi and action packed books you will enjoy Exile to hell; recommended.	2001-03-08

Straub took settings and situations that mostly are reserved for female characters and filled them in with men.  The range of emotions displayed by each male in this book was unique and refreshing to see.  Now, as for the story, it was okay but again I was let down. this book does connect the other two together but mystry and Throat failed to keep up the suspense that was evident in Koko.  I read or in my case listened to all three back to back and each could have stood on its own.  Again, if you enjoy mysteries, read this one as well, but not for strict horror fans.  Out of all the books I have listened so far by this author, Ghost Story is the best followed by Koko and then Houses without Doors where all this Blue Rose business begins.	2001-03-06

From the reviews and all, I thought Mystery would be a continuation of the Blue Rose murders, but not really.  This was nothing but a mystery story of the boring variety; the kind where the main character goes around interviewing one person after another; what a yawn.  Stick to Horror Mr. Straub you do that much better.  Thank God its Value priced.  Yes I bought the audiobook version but I don't think I missed much, perhaps the connection with Koko?  Anyway, if you like a mystery read it but not for a horror fan like myself.	2001-03-06

Peter Straub truly has a gift for bringing the grotesque and the literary together.  I always enjoy this man's work.  Koko refers to a ruthless killer who was once a Vietnam vet and who experienced great horrors during his time there.  He was part of a group and all the members of that group sustained great psychological scars from their tour of duty.  Koko however could not live with his scars and so sets out to right wrongs that happened nearly twenty years ago.  The blood soon starts to flow and the remaining members of that group try to find out who exactly koko is and stop him.  From thialand to New york Straub serves a suspense filled thriller full of murder and decadence.  A great horror novel and I was glad to see Harry Beavers from &quot;Houses without Doors&quot; finally get waht he was due.	2001-02-24

Action packed, suspenseful and just plain fantastic is what this book is.  A heart pounding chase scene in the underbelly of the Galaxy's ruling planet.

However, his opposition is not without resolve as well and even a powerful Syth Lord like Maul will not find the mission so easy to fulfill.  Michael Reaves has done a fine job in crafting this installment; a hard to put down novel that will have you at the edge of your seat.  Adn waht a twist at the end.  Yes we know more or less that the blockade will take place, but if the reader forgets those events while reading this he will be in for one great read.  For sure one of my favorites; now I can't wait for Cloack of Deception which is the middle book to this trilogy which begins with Shadow Hunter and ends with Phantom Menace.  As well, hats off to Random House Audio for a great audio production this story was made for an audio format.	2001-02-11

I don't exactly know why but Anderson created this brilliant character only to make her out to be nothing but stupid and full of pomposity.  Admiral Daala has got to be one of the coolest newly created characters in the SW universe yet her creater seems to give little regard for her abilities.  Anderson is so eager to make sure that good triumphs over evil that he will do anything to make sure he meets that goal; including sacrificing storylines and dumbing characters to the hilt.   This book started out great and ended up being just plain unbelievable and silly.  First, Anderson set out to write a storyline about a superweapon similar to the Death Star only to simply grow tired of the storyline in the end and have it simply smash into an astaroid so he could get rid of it.  Second, he creates this female Admiral full of determination and stratagy only to have her lose a simple battle which the odds were tipped in her favor.  Don't tell me a bunch of cheery jedi can defeat a full imperial attack comprising of numorous star destroyers and a super star destroyer.  Don't tell me that only one jedi got killed during this whole assault; don't tell me that some jedi bimbo managed single handedly without the force to bring down a massive war ship full of troopers and personnel; No, Mr. Anderson lets face it, you were looking for excuses to finish the book and you chose the most illogical ones to do so. personally, I think this should have been another trilogy or at least a duology.  Admiral Dalla should have won the battle reduced the jedi knights to half their number and gotten close to absolute victory before being stopped for good.  She had the means and the determination to do so.  As well in a plot twist she could have seized control of the darksaber and exterminated Durga in the process.  And how, oh how, I kept hoping in the final scene Daala would have blown Calista's head off; but no Anderson couldn't even let her die because it simply would have not been right.I gave 4 stars for the action Anderson knows how to write about that but I would rate it 1 star for plot and character development.  Thank the darkside the New Jedi Order series is full of true villans who are not portrayed stupidly and where the force doesn't always save the day.	2001-01-28

Sometimes you're in the mood for a horror book or thriller that will not only entertain but make you think a bit as well.  this book does just that.  I purchased the audio version and thus didn't get all the stories that were in the print endition but from what I heard the stories were captivating.  &quot;blue Rose&quot; was by far the best; though the ending was a bit of a let down not because of the story itself but because the character didnt' get his due.  Another good one was &quot;Bar Talk&quot; which I suspect was a sort of a continuation of &quot;blue Rose.&quot;  I can't wait to start Koko which also expands the story of &quot;blue Rose.&quot;  all and all a good entertaining audiobook.  The reader did a fine job narrating and I loved his deep smooth voice.	2001-01-22

In short, a pointless book full of nothing with gore and blood to make it seem something.  After all, without the gore this poor excuse for a book would have never seen publication.  I can't believe wall street types act this way and if they do, I'm sure its a small minority.  As for the poor depicted in this book, they were so wooden and stale that no shock could truly be derived from their deaths.  My only regret after finishing the book besides wasting my time was that Evelyn never got killed; I was sure Bateman would have snuffed her out.  Not recommended; move on to something better like Patterson James or Richard North or even try the latest Star Wars book, now that's true suspense.	2001-01-22

Yes, the plot is simple but who the hell needs a complicated plot anyway, especially when they are writing fast pace horror such as this.  This book will put you in the middle of a bloodbath; a town which has gone crazy and where no one is truly a hero.  Don't go out in the rain whatever you do, it wil prove to be deadly.  The book starts off with a murder of a black boy and basically the thrilling ride accelerates from there.  Some will say its B rated material but i think its true horror or what I would deem a horror novel; certainly in terms better then Anne Rice puts out that is suppose to be horror.  Buy the book and you will see what I mean.  It might make you cringe a bit but what's horror without a few blood and guts and rape scenes.	2000-11-20

After the suspense of Agents of chaos 1 and 2 I could not wait for Balance point to come out.  Going by the title I thought it would have more to do with Centerpoint or something to that affect but I was wrong.  While not as action packed and dark as the previous books I did like it in the end.  Leia's up and close and personal meeting with the vong warmaster is bound to give her something to think about in the next installment.  However, the most irritating thing about this book is Jason Solo.  Waht a wimp!  He takes the light/dark side thing to the limit; one hopes that Kyp might step in and set him right.  I never seen such a nellie Jedi before!  Its only when he is pushed to the breaking point that he finally sees that using the force wont turn him into grandpa Vader.  I gave the book 4 stars for the last part of the book; prier to that the book for me dragged on.  It was interesting to see Jaynna injured and such but there should have been a bit more action.  And how about Luke and Mara; they are going to be parents now; sorry if I spoiled it for anyone.  While this is a good sub plot and one which will benefit the Star Wars universe I can't help but think how homophobic Star Wars is in a lot of ways.  We have this entire Galaxy, and surely there has to be planets  where there live a few gay folk.  While Star Wars is not the place for sexual politics; its an all ages universe after all, I think adding a diverse range of characters would  not be a bad thing.  It doesn't have to be explicit or anything but it would give a quick nod to the fact that there are different people out there.  If we can have humans courting furry aliens and such why not a minor gay character?  A gay Jedi?  parish the thoght some might say.  At any rate Star Wars is all about action good and evil and suspense filled adventure and I hope it will always stay that way.  Buy this book for it does add to the NJO series and now lets look forward to the next one hwich will take us back in time.	2000-11-11

I have to say  Next to the Star Wars audio dramas this audiobook comes a close second.   the acting is excellent and really brings the story to life.   this book  deals with what Bram Stoker must have come across while doing his research  for Dracula.  It tells the story of Countess Elizabeth Battaorey a noble in  the 17th century in Hungary.  Upon learning that her beloved husband the  Lord Battorey has been killed in a battle away from his land she goes mad  and seeks out a way to bring him back to her.  Her servent introduces her  to a witch and together these three undertake a grizzly trip into torture,  vamprism and satan worship.   Young girl after young girl is brought to  Castle battorey only to be drained of blood and mutalated.  Under the  guidence of the witch Darvoulla the countess sinks ever more deeper and  deeper into horror and mayhem until her kingdom can no longer deny the  truth. this story would be shocking enough if it was only fiction but this  is in fact a true story and all the events narrated did actually happen.

If I had to recommend a good suspense novel, this would be it.   the suspense never stops from the first word and you are simply glued to  the book wanting to find out what is going to happen next.  Casanova and  the Gentleman Caller have to be the most ruthless killers I have ever  encountered in suspense literature. Monsters though they are, Patterson  manages to make them seem highly attractive and desirable at the same time.   I have to confess some of the sex scenes aroused me a bit but this was due  to the readers ability to put you right there.  I guess I'm morbid or  something.  The theory of Twinning was riveting and it gave some insight to  these two psychos.   Alex Cross was his usual best though one does kind of  hope he gets a bit more then mere cuts and bruises while hunting down these  killers.   The house of horrors was well conceived and one could truly feel  for the women being kept there.  the audio production was top notch and you  will find yourself finishing the book in just one sitting.  I was kind of  hoping that Casanova would get away in the end, that there would be a  sequel but... well read or listen and you will find out what happens.  You  will need though to take a deep breath after you are done.	2000-08-02

Mill on the floss is much more then a mere tragic story; if the reader looks more carefully  she or he can see the various social themes that Eliot tackled in this  book.  Themes I might add that are still around today. The rich against the  poor, eg, Edward Tolliver's struggle against Wickem.  Sexism, prejudice  against people with disabilities,  hypocrisy social judgement and morality.   All these issues were raised in this story of family love, duty and  trajedy.  This book though classifyed as classic literature can still teach  us a lot about the human condition.  Its underlining messages still very  much relevant today.  I especially found the scene of maggie and Steven in  the Inn very poignant.  one could truly feel what Maggie was going through  at that moment.  Another outstanding scene was the one where Tom confronts  Philip in the woods and berates him for having the boldness to court his  sister.  pointing out his deformaty he usues it as a weapon to drive Philip  to the ground despite the fact that class wise philip was above Tom.   George Eliot (Mary Anne Evens) must be laughing somewhere seeing how her  books are still talked about today.   Finally, I have to congradulate Naxos  on producing another great audiobook.  Sara Kestelman does an excellent job  at narrating this lovely story.	2000-07-19

All right, this book was good in the sense that it gave us the insight to one of her most likeable vampires, Armand.  I did enjoy the story, the settings the sex scenes (if only I could have such a luscious love life)  yet after finishing the book I scratched my head and asked myself, havne't  I read this story somewhere before?  I.E.  Beautiful mortal is found by  vampire, vampire and beautiful mortal have a mad passionate affair, vampire  turns beautiful mortal into vampire.  Next, beautiful vampire that was  beautiful mortal starts to question everything.  Who am I really?  Why does  God allow this?  Who was the first...and so on.  It gets pretty tiresome if  this plot is done again and again.  Enough with the religious questions!  I  am a fan of Anne Rice but though she loves detail, and good character  development plot to her is like an after thought which more often then not  spoils her great landscapes and characters.  I hope in the upcoming book  that we can leave the past behind; please Anne we've had enough history  lessons!  Lets see some action, some tragic events!  By the way folks what  on earth happens to all those dead bodies that the vampires kill?  I mean  you would think a cop or two would start to get just a little suspicious.	2000-06-29

The day the book arrived I had to be out all day and so carried it around with me listening to bits here and there.  I would stop at a coffee shop and listen to it for a while longer and then I had to go and do some work  as well.  Simply put, I could not put this book down.  Yes the wait was  worth it and boy if the rest of the New Jedi order volumes are going to be  like this I might have to stop socializing for a while in order to read  them over and over again.  The suspense in this one could not be beat and  michael Stackpole once again captured the essence of Star Wars.  The  battles were fantastic, the characters right on and what a duel at the end!   My heart was racing overtime!  I thoght, Oh no, not him, not Coron!  Well,  I wont give out any spoilers but the person who begins to read or in this  case listen to this book is in for one very thrilling time.  Just buy it,  find yourself a comfortable chair and hang a &quot;Do not disturb&quot;  sighn on your door because you will not want to be drawn away no matter if  its work or fun. In addition, Hats off to Anthony Heald who does such an  excellent job in narrating these books; he entertains me every time.	2000-06-22

While listening to it alone in a quiet room I found myself looking over my shoulder just to make sure that no evil little monster was there waiting to pounce on me.  this story is  full of horrors both supernatural and human.  This all blends well together  to give the listener a real horrifying experience.  After listening to it  you'll want to listen to some nice soothing music or watch some comedy to  get your mind off what you just heard.  Beware however if you hear a loud  knock at your door or if someone visits you in your sleep.  I wont give the  plot away but to say that its about a family which moves to small town Main  and who will undergo several horrific changes.  the audio pruduction is  second to none and the acting is tops.  buy this and prepare to be  frightened.	2000-06-16

Though it has it's horific moments the book is mainly about the trial of the devil and whether or not he deserves to go  back to heaven.  The story takes us through various periods in history  showing tragic events and letting you decide whether or not the devil was  the engineer behind the events or it was merely man's mistakes and  judgement.  The jury listens and then has to reach a verdict.  Throughout  his trial however, the devil pleads, cajoles and even seduces various  members of the court so that they can see things his way.  He even kills  one or two of them for fun. Its an entertaining story, a bit campy at times  but funny as well.  I would not classify it as a horror story though.  The  production is well done as is all Sci-fi channel's works and the acting is  top notch.  The devil in particular has a very sexy voice which truly reels  you in.  I wouldn't mind spending a few hours in hell.  give it a listen if  you are a lover of sci-fi, fantasy but it will not scare you that much.   the ending is a bit of a shocker and the encounter between the devil and  Jesus is helarious.  It may be a bit offensive to those who are religious  but not by much.	2000-06-15

This audio production had me on the edge of my seat since tape one started rolling.  &quot;Mommy&quot; is a suspense filled story about a  loving mother who shall we say, wants nothing more then to do whats right  for her daughter not to mention for herself.  The story begins with an  innocent visit to Jessica Anne's school by her devoted mother.  As soon as  mommy meets up with Jessica Anne's teacher and has a slight disagreement  with her, the horror begins and doesn't stop till the very end. This is a  story of motherly love, a daughter's affection and about the special bond  between a mother and daughter, even though at times such a bond can take on  dark connotations.  After all, there is nothing a mother wouldn't do for a  daughter such as Jessica Anne.  Listening to this production one thinks of  another special mommy who caused a lot of campers to retire rather early  shall we say; indeed if that mommy and this mommy got together for tea,  well what a truly horrifying scene that would be. Sunset productions did a  great job with this story; the reader was good and gave the right amount of  tention and suspense where it was needed.  in addition the music and sound  effects which are heard along with the reader make this production one you  will want to listen over and over again, but do not let mommy catch you  reading in the middle of the night, it can prove to be deadly.	2000-06-11

Meg, is such a book.  Yes its been done before but in my opinion this one is much, much better than Jaws.   I found Jaws to be rather slow at times while Meg has a pace equal with  that of Meg's speed.  I really didn't care about the human characters in  this one only the shark.  Every time an attack was about to take place I  was rooting for the shark to get them all!   The ending i found breath  taking and it was nice to see that Alten didn't go for the big explosion  ending as is so common in such books. As for details, well who cares;  whether or not a shark can truly jump out of the water like that its  irrelevent this is a work of fiction after all.  You want facts go read an  encyclopedia.  You want non-stop suspense, read Meg. Having bought the  audio version I found it to be a good production.  The music accompaniment  worked quite well along with the reader and really brought up the suspense  level while listening to it.  Great book great production, now I can't wait  to listen to the sequel, Trench.	2000-06-04

After the edge of your seat suspense with Onslaught, reading this one was a bit of a low.   Good points. It showed us Anakin's anger and what is about to come,  As well good insight to the emotions and feelings of this  dark lord to be. * Liked the introduction of the young Tarkin.  We see why  he rises so fast in the Empire. Bad points. * Too fantastic for my taste.   While we get a hint of early dipictions of the Vong, the whole planet was  just a tad too weird even for Star Wars.  Too much fantasy and not enough  Sci fi. * Waht was the point of Raith Seinar?  He really didn't do much in  the end. * WHERE IS THE ACTION!   This is a Star Wars book after all.  I  bought the CD version which claimed to be abridged but I actually fell  asleep by the third CD and only got interested by the end of the fourth CD.   Next time make Anakin's little jonts through a world less stretched out.  Audio Good reading by the narrator though he could have used a bit more  variety in doing some of the voices. If you are a Star Wars devoteee by all  means get it, it does have its good points but its not the best in the lot.	2000-05-06

Another brilliant entry in the Star Wars saga.  the new Jedi Order is really starting to take shape with this book.  the Solo kids really show their stuff in this one while still allowing for the main characters to  shine as well.  True Han and Lando were kind of left out in this book but  they will be back, I am sure of it and its good to see new characters, and  new plot lines taking shape.  One thing that is really good about this  whole new jedi series is that  the Vong, are true villains not some moronic  imperial leader with no back bone at all and who is defeated without hardly  any effort or sacrifice.  Unlike the Empire, the Vong have a take no  prisoners attitude and do not spare anyone.  I hope the ruthlessness will  continue with feature entries for it makes for a better and a more  believable war.	2000-05-01

Even though Han is not my favorite character in the Star Wars universe,  I found this book to be very well written and totally engrossing.  A.C. Crispin has done an excellent job in fleshing out the character and telling  the story of the most roguish hero of the Rebellion.  In addition, David  Pittu did a superb job in narrating the story; love his Han voice and the  way he does the Hutts!	2000-03-16

How anti climatic can you get?  Oh Helen is rummaging through her medicine cabinet to see what she can find to use against her attacker!  Cut to Julie's house and the final scene and the sap Ray says in the end.  Give me a break!  Note, this  book was originally published in 75 so a lot of things are so retro that  well, kind of makes you laugh  compared to the pop culture of today.

Apart from non-stop action and chilling scenes this book asks the reader to examine him or herself, and  not  jump too quickly to convenient conclusions which most often then not  fail.  Hannibal Lecter is a monster but an intellectual one and thus adds  an attractive dimension to his character.  He is also a person of great  understanding and empathy and thus is the reason that Clarice falls for him  in the end. If a reader is willing to go beyond the mere suspense of this  story and read between the lines he or she would see the true horror, and  see in how in all of us lurks a side we rarely reveal to ourselves. I have  to say I really enjoyed this book and was glad to see Mason get what he had  coming to him as well as Krendler.   For those who disagree, Clarice really  didnt' have much of a choice.  Lecter was the person who finally helped her  break free from her father's ghost.  The life she knew before did not. As  for the production, having bought the audiobook version, it was great  though Mr. Gerroll overdid it a bit concerning Mason's character.  At times  it was very difficult to understand him; all and all though he did an  excellent job reading this great book; Bravo mr. Harris, hopefully you have  not put your irresistible monster to rest forever; after all, he now has a  bride of sorts; a fourth entry into his life would be greatly appreciated.	1999-12-22

When the book arrived I put it on right away, headphones and all for the whole effect.  I was quite surprised and found it interesting first time round but after a couple of plays it gets to be a  bit monotonous.  The stories are good as far as erotica goes but if they  are ment to excite, they should have had a few more sound effects to each  one.  The most exciting track of the whole thing that caused a ripple in me  was the beginning with the sounds of love making and the sound of the whip.   Peep show was good, and the woman was arousing to listen to.  However,  being bisexual, I wish they had the samething done by a man.  The track  after Peep Show was silly, and the final track a boring joke.  like I  stated before, if more sounds had been added it would have been great.	1999-12-06
US	51628249	R1NAGTWETB6Q0Z	0787122564	67741254	The Exorcist	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Still horrific but getting dated	Well I was glad to see The Exorcist released on cassette and unabridged to boot.  However, why, oh why did Blatty do the reading?  As an audio book they could have done so much with such a story but no, Blatty had to read  it.  His low deep tone does nothing for me and blends all the characters  into one so you really can't distinguish between Chris, Regan or Karras.  His accents are okay, Swiss and greek but well, he has no variety in his  voice.  A terrific thing that they could have done was have different  readers for the demon; say one for Berk, one for the Demon's voice and one  for the jibberish voice.   I have to say if it wasn't for the story, I  would give this production one star instead of 4.  Still it was chilling  but reading or in this case listening to it I found it a bit dated; I mean  the story is so well known and although some scenes still invoke terror I  found myself saying, &quot;just get on with it.&quot;  Karras I find can be  down right boring at times and his troubled faith gets to be overdone in  places. another thing regarding the audio aspect, Blatty at times makes the  demon sound like a neurotic drag queen; its more funny than anything else.  At least I have a classic now in my collection and being an audiophile its  a prize but I have to say the story should soon be put away or given a  special recognition in the horror worldd and then forgotten.	1999-11-17

I feel Salvatore has done a great job in advancing the SW saga.  The Yuuzhan Vong are a deadly opponent and one which will give the new Republic a run for their credits.  I find nothing  wrong with this production, ie. I bought the audio version; I'm glad to see  Anthony Heald reading the new crop of books; I think he does an excellent  job along with the sound effects and music accompaniments.  As for the  story itself I felt it was fast paced and well thought out.  Personally I  feel its about time a main character died, I mean come on, and wouldn't  mind seeing one or two more go.   In adddition this was the first SW book  which wasn't loaded with sugar coating.  Some say it was too graphical in  vilence but I say not.  The X-wing series also carries the same tone as  this book and I enjoy those too as well.  The Jedi are not unbeatable as  another reviewer stated and thus are susceptible to disease and alike.  All  and all great job Mr. Salvatore.	1999-11-17

However I found the plot a bit boring and not very grippihng, though after reading the reviews here I might go back  and finish it.  I would also like to comment on some of the reviewers who  found the story good but were put off because the main character was gay.  Well now you know how us gay folk feel when we read a main stream novel for  the story but find it riddled with heterosexuality.  Like the guy below me,  I find myself tuning out the love scenes in main stream books because they  simply bore me.  I live for the day when all books will appeal to all  readers.

I really was enthralled with this book.  It had a lot of surprises which kept the story line interesting and suspenseful.  I think that this trilogy was a good portrayal of boba  Fett and for those who think not, Stop reading those stupid comics!!  I  have a point to make regarding these books.  I am a blind reader who relys  on the audio version of books to stay on top of current titles.  Though the  audio version of Star wars books are usually abridged, they usually come  with sound effects and music which turns the book into a kind of audio  movie.  I think the trade off is worth it and would rather listen to an  abridged version which basically tells the main story rather then read a  full version with additional yet unnecessary passages.  I say this because  I find when listening to these books they really put you in the Star Wars  universe and you don't get bored!  Take my advise and listen to a few,  you'll be glad you did!!  Maybe then you wouldn't find some of SW books too  long or boring!	1999-07-22
