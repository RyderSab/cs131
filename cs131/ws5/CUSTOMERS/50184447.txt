Harris' book breathed new life into the ruins as I visited them, and Vesuvius looked all the more menacing as it towered over Pompeii.<br /><br />For me, what separated this book from your typical mass-market fiction was the research that Harris obviously put into this book, as well as the unique perspective he guides the reader from.  Rather than an obvious main character (such as Pliny, or a generic centurion), we have Aquarius: a man of character and honor, who above all has a pretty cool job that provided a bit of suspense to a book with an inescapably obvious ending to anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of Roman history!<br /><br />A fun summer read that's fascinating and well-written, Pompeii: A Novel provides a unique perspective on a famous natural disaster.  I give it a solid 4-star recommendation.	2005-08-09

By the end of the story I felt that I was much more able to grasp the realities of autism as well as the extreme challenges that family and friends (not to mention complete strangers!) face when trying to figure out how to interact with an autistic person.  Compelling and compassionate without being overtly or overly so, this was an excellent concept and brilliant point of view to write a story from.<br /><br />This being said, the story/plot itself could've used a little more work--this is clearly a \\"first novel.\\"  The mystery of the \\"curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\" is revealed remarkably quickly and brushed over with surprisingly little comment (I thought Christopher was the only one whose response seemed proportionate to the rather brutal crime) ... the end of the story gave into a mass-media \\"and they all lived happily ever after\\" style resolution ... there were small inconsistencies where Christopher would say one thing and then disprove himself (for example he states that he cannot understand how people picture themselves doing something other than what they are doing, yet he easily pictures himself being an astronaut) ...<br /><br />Despite its relatively minor flaws, this book was still an excellent read.  I'm curious to see where Haddon goes from here if he decides to write another book ... this would be a hard one to follow!	2005-08-09
US	50184447	R1NMBFRV188DN1	080483251X	90774506	Kappa	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Memorable satire	\\"Kappa\\" is a wonderful lampoon of Japanese society written by the gifted but troubled Akutagawa Ryunosuke.  Even though nearly 80 years have passed since Kappa was written, the people and subjects that Akutagawa impales with his pen (religion, capitalism, literature, abortion, heredity, etc.) are no less pressing today, making Kappa nearly as easy to analyze and enjoy now as when it was written.<br /><br />Akutagawa's writing style is a joy as always, and the plot is familiar to readers of Robinson Crusoe or Alice in Wonderland (Akutagawa finished translating Alice in Wonderland the same year he wrote Kappa).  Adapting the tale to Japan, Akutagawa chooses to use an outsider to Kappaland in a role as a \\"specially protected person,\\" much like foreigners were treated (and to a degree still are treated) in Japan.  The reader is left with the question of whether Patient 23 is sane or not, and more importantly, has the world we live in gone mad?  Despite the years that have passed since it was written, Kappa continues to be a fun and pertinent read.  Reading Kappa, I am reminded of the great shame it is that the world lost as brilliant a writer as Akutagawa at such a young age.	2005-05-30
US	50184447	R12EDDC60RAP5V	4770019513	700298850	69 (Kodansha Modern Writers)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Pure fun	Although it's not fair to compare Ryu and Haruki Murakami simply because they share the same family name, I couldn't help but feel that \\"69\\" was Ryu's \\"Norwegian Wood.\\"  In both stories (interestingly, both were written in 1987 about the year 1969!), the authors take a break from their normal styles and write semi-autobiographical works about their school days.  At the same time, it would be a mistake to consider both works fundamentally different from the authors' other works--\\"Norwegian Wood\\" is essentially Haruki's other stories without the Sheep Men and mysterious wells, \\"69\\" is the essence of Ryu's other works, sans the acid trips and coin lockers.<br /><br />Ryu's message is simple: You win in life by having fun.  Whereas Haruki's protagonists are coolly detached (the main character in Norwegian Wood watches the college demonstrations impassively), Ryu's are fiercely proactive--it's Ken that starts the trouble at his school.  Although Ryu finishes \\"69\\" with a slightly bittersweet ending, the vast majority of the book is about having fun.  Rebellion vs. authority, beauty vs. ugliness, extroverts vs. introverts: \\"69\\" has few grey areas.  Some people might criticize this lack of complexity as a sign of immaturity, but for me it was refreshing to read a book as optimistic and frank as this one.<br /><br />\\"69\\" will bother people aching for hidden meanings (why do people get bothered when an author actually says plainly what he means?) or some kind of bildungsroman formula involving personal growth (Ryu captures the energy and unabashed egoism of a 17 year old perfectly, rather than burdening Ken with some kind of post-modern angst).  But really, who cares?  Have fun reading this book!	2005-05-30

The characters belong to an upper class family, and are concerned with appearances, understated refinement, and tradition.  Scenes such as the cherry blossom viewings and the firefly hunt are given as much importance as great floods and miscarriages.  Although the characters have great depth, they are still not quite accessible--they belong to a different age and class, and float before the reader like a painting on a silk screen.  Although the themes of encroaching modernity and falling family fortunes are forever in the picture, in the end it is tradition that has the happy ending, modernity that has her hopes crushed.  As other readers have remarked, this is a significant shift from Naomi, where the \\"modern girl\\" is the clear and decisive victor.<br /><br />In many ways, The Makioka Sisters is a full-length novel version of Tanizaki's essay \\"In Praise of Shadows.\\"  Few pages go by without a mention of traditional elements of Japanese culture: poetry writing, architecture, nature, dance, etc.  None is a casual reference; all have layers of nuance and undertone.  Still, there is the feeling that Tanizaki has Traditional Culture win the battle but lose the war, for he--like us--knows that Japan has lost World War II and the elegant world he has created will not survive the following decades of strongly Western-influenced modernization.  The youth and beauty of the Makioka sisters and their world is to scatter in the wind like the petals of so many cherry blossoms.<br /><br />Captured best in the scene where Sachiko lies awake watching a lone firefly play about in her kimono sleeve before she lets it go, the book is a reminder that there is no such thing as true timelessness.  The Makioka Sisters is very much a story about a family, a nation, and a culture on the brink of violent change.  This book will reward readers with the insight and patience to savor every detail and contemplate every nuance.  Tanizaki's masterpiece, this book deserves five stars.d contemplate every nuance.

US	50184447	R2NQJQZKNLTI8V	0375724745	874076537	Naomi	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Pygmalita	'Naomi', Tanizaki's first major novel, starts off simply: a relatively young middle-class man discovers an even younger woman, who he sees as both exotic (starting with her western-sounding name 'Naomi' and Mary Pickford-esque looks) and an exciting work-in-progress, a Japanese Pygmalion.  She ends up living with him, and (to no great surprise) they end up as man and wife.  This is where the fun begins.<br /><br />Joji begins to see the sarcastic and nasty side to Naomi, who, with his nurturing, has turned into a full-fledged 'modern girl' (or 'Moga' as the Japanese referred to them).  Interested in avant-garde clothing and modern dancing, red flags go up as Joji meets her large number of intimate male friends and gradually recognizes her manipulative ways.  Still, he has decided that it is not that women deceive men; rather, men enjoy being deceived by women.  The rest of the story progresses as an ever-deepening spiral of manipulation and masochism as Naomi fully exploits her role as Joji's Lolita-like object of obsession.<br /><br />Although this story was so shocking that its serialization was briefly halted, the idea of sexually-dominant women and submissive men is a theme repeated often in Tanizaki's works (perhaps the pinnacle of this theme in Tanizaki's work is the early short story 'The Tattooer' or 'Portrait of Shunkin').<br /><br />While it's easy to generalize and say that Naomi represents the West, Joji the East, I think that might be an oversimplification and miss Tanizaki's more immediate point.  First and foremost, Naomi represents the Japanese 'modern girl', an increasingly powerful and liberated creature with even more weapons to make men submit to her.  This story is as much modernity vs. tradition as it is West vs. East.  After all, despite Joji's casual interest in dance and even his pseudo-western name (Joji/George) he is no match for the fully modernized Naomi.  When things start to go wrong, Joji tries to run for traditional safety nets (a traditional house, clothes, family structure), but Naomi doesn't let him.  Modernity allows Naomi to fight back on equal (if not more powerful) footing, and permits her to be realized as an object of loathing, obsession, and desire in ways not yet seen in Japan.<br /><br />No matter how you interpret the story, 'Naomi' is a sexy, humorous, and ironic tale of \\"a fool's love\\", as the original title suggests.  It's a memorable book and a great introduction to the master writer Tanizaki.ts (a traditional house, clothes, family structure), but Naomi doesn't let him.

US	50184447	R2XCXCIVUTI33A	0679723161	636015448	Lolita	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Exquisite,  forbidden fruit	Nabokov's 'Lolita' has a special aura about it- nearly everyone has heard of it and even those who have not read it know the general outline of it: a grown man's love for a young girl (or nymphet, in Nabokov's language).  The subject matter and even the very book cover of the Vintage edition itself makes 'Lolita' a book that is, like Humbert Humbert himself, slightly awkward and embarrassing to be associated with in public.  And yet, 'Lolita' has endured for over fifty years as a classic of literature because of Nabokov's fine mastery of prose and a story that never ceases to suck the reader down into H.H.'s gleefully obsessive, beautiful, grotesque, ironic, and lyrical world.<br /><br />In many ways it is amazing that this novel saw the light of day; Nabokov willingly admits it deals with one of the \\"three taboo\\" subject matters of the day (and remains as taboo, if not even more so, today).  The book is rich with allusions to history and other works of literature, yet it does not rely on these allusions for understanding of the work, just for its full enjoyment.  As Nabokov himself remarks, it is a mistake to over-symbolize the book as Old Europe (Humbert) exploiting (or alternately, being exploited by) Young America (Lolita).  Instead, this book should be best enjoyed for what it is--a masterpiece unto itself.<br /><br />If you're reading these reviews but have not read 'Lolita' yet, let me add my voice to the hundreds already here in praise of the novel.  Rush out to the nearest bookstore or library and dive into Nabokov's world of devilish nymphets and doomed compulsion--you won't regret it.	2005-03-24

I was pleased to read a book that was both educational and entertaining, and covers a topic that is unfortunately so-often neglected: practical, modern Japanese culture.  This book should be required reading for anyone interested in either living in Japan or working with Japanese either at home or in Japan.  This book should also be required reading for students of Japanese as well, regardless of language level.  Even for people with experience in Japan (for whom most of the information is hopefully second nature by now) this book serves as a helpful reminder and warning to common cultural pitfalls that even experts can fall into.<br /><br />There were only a few aspects of this book that disappointed me and kept me from giving it 5 stars.  These points include:<br /><br />-The title: whoever came up with title should be fired.  Not only is it generic and uninspiring but it could give the reader the mistaken impression that it is a language textbook.  By and large, it is NOT.  This is a book on Japanese culture with a few language tidbits thrown in.<br /><br />-The infatuation with Eleanor Jorden's works.  Some people love them, others hate them ... count me in the latter category.  From the perspective of pure linguistics, Jorden's might be superior books but from the perspective of language acquisition I cannot recommend them: particularly if you are studying on your own.  Horvat partially redeemed himself in my eyes by praising Nagara Susumu's \\"Japanese for Everyone\\" which I think is an outstanding textbook.<br /><br />-Anti-Hepburn attitude.  I'm sorry, but romaji should be there for the aid of people who are NOT proficient in Japanese (those that ARE proficient really don't need romaji!) ... you'll never convince me that a person unfamiliar with Japanese will pronounce \\"Huzi\\" or \\"Mitubisi\\" close to how they should be pronounced!<br /><br />-Length: as other reviewers have mentioned, this could have been two or three times as long.  $15 for a book under 200 pages seems a bit steep.<br /><br />But these are relatively minor points and should not keep you from buying this book.

From Mars' Song, a blistering attack of a \\"war without wisdom\\" to the Legend of Gold, a snapshot of the dreams and disappointments in the immediate post-war period, and finally the Raptor, a surreal look at the new peace in post-Occupation Japan, this collection of stories is a penetrating look at a controversial and tumultuous period in modern Japanese history.<br /><br />Discussion of literature in wartime and immediate post-war Japan often centers on figures such as Kawabata and Mishima, but Ishikawa's gift for combining brazenness with subtlety added to his uncompromising resistance to the Japanese war machine makes his tales important additions to the canon of Japanese literature.	2004-12-03

Kafka on the Shore is at once familiar and unfamiliar to readers of past Murakami stories: in story and in plotting it is reminiscent of past works of Murakami; the Tamura Kafka storyline is in many ways a re-telling of Hard-Boiled Wonderland, and the split narrative style also reminds one of that book.  Indeed, many times throughout the book I found myself thinking that Kafka on the Shore felt like a kind of summation of Murakami's works, all the way from Hear the Wind Sing through After the Quake in terms of style and plot elements.<br /><br />Despite the many familiar elements, there are several significant deviations from the usual formula, starting with the protagonist Tamura Kafka.  Unlike the typical 30-something \\"everyman\\" familiar to readers of Murakami, Kafka on the Shore features the young and proactive Tamura Kafka and to the best of my knowledge is the first of Murakami's novels to be written half in the third person, giving Murakami a bit more freedom in telling this tale from different characters' perspectives.  More important than narrative technique was Murakami's approach to the story: whereas many of Murakami's novels are full of a sense of loneliness and a feeling that the characters are chasing after something which is already beyond their reach, Tamura Kafka is very much in charge of his own destiny as his choice at the climax of the novel indicates.<br /><br />Although Kafka on the Shore started off wonderfully, by the second half of the book, the plot became unusually linear and predictable for a Murakami novel.  The Nakata/Hoshino plotline in particular was cryptic without the scope or wonder of Wind-Up Bird, for example.  Oshima, one of the most interesting characters Murakami has created (and that's saying a lot) is sadly underused in the second half.  Murakami's use of corporate icons and feminist figures is awkward and a bit forced.  In general, what starts off with the potential to be Murakami's masterpiece falls a bit short in the end.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that Kafka on the Shore feels like Murakami is undergoing a shift in style and in substance but it is a little unclear where he is trying to go to.  Unfortunately, his latest novel, After Dark, does not clear up the issue either.  As Murakami has aged, his protagonists have gotten younger (a 15-year old boy in Kafka and a 19-year old woman in After Dark) ... but they often seem like a middle-aged \\"everyman\\" trapped in a young person's body.  It will be enjoyable to see what direction Murakami takes in the future, but compared to his works of the '80s and early '90s, Murakami's recent works have retained his energy ... but lost a bit of the soul that make a Murakami novel an experience greater than the sum of its parts.end. <br /> <br />Part of the problem is that Kafka on the Shore feels like Murakami is undergoing a shift in style and in substance but it is a little unclear where he is trying to go to.

Not once is there a surprise, and despite the \\"action\\" that occurs, never is there a suspenseful moment.<br /><br />And on and on.  But I thought the story was better than Shadow of the Hegemon, which felt like the game of Risk on steroids.  In Shadow Puppets, the characters are forced to make hard choices, success and failure were not always so clear, and a feeling of melancholy hung over the tale.  Although the major characters in the book disappointed me more often than not, the minor characters played interesting roles.  Virlomi's Wall of India was simple, yet powerful.  Alai in particular was fascinating as the Caliph, a figure elegant and powerful, yet terribly constrained by duty and religion (he reminded me a bit of the young protagonist of Dune).<br /><br />After the disappointing end to the original post-Ender's Game trilogy, I had ceased to expect great things of this series, so perhaps that is why I was not as disappointed as others were with this book.  I was encouraged by Card's return to focusing on the characters, even if his attempts at characterization were often flawed at best.<br /><br />I see that Card is churning out another book in the series: \\"Shadow of the Giant\\" is due to come out early next year.  Part of me wishes that I had stopped at the original \\"Ender's Game\\", I should have known Card could never top that.  Yet I keep going in the series, as I imagine many other readers have, seeing sparks of genius in his books and always hoping for more (despite the inevitable disappointment).

Written by most anyone but Mishima this would be portrayed as a story of regret and tragedy, but in the hands of Mishima, the couple is described in tones extolling their beauty and virtue; death explained in words that evoke images of heat and passion.  Mishima does not sugarcoat the experience; he lays it bare for the reader.  My personal feelings regarding the content of this short story are at odds with those of Mishima, but I cannot deny the power and skill of \\"Patriotism\\".  This is the type of book that should be read and discussed, a story that loses no power despite the time that has elapsed since it was written nearly forty years ago.<br /><br />An interesting note regarding the title: although the original title (Yukoku) is usually translated as \\"patriotism\\" in English, the word carries different overtones than the English word \\"patriotism\\" or the more common Japanese word \\"aikoku\\" or \\"aikokushin\\".  Yukoku translates more accurately as worry or anxiety over the present state or future of one's country.  It is also a homophone for another word that means \\"evening\\".  When reading this tale, remember these details as well as the fact that Mishima wrote this tale not during the heat and fury of wartime Japan, but twenty years after World War II ended, and this story will take on new nuances.<br /><br />Patriotism is an intense study in nationalism, wartime-Japan style, as well as a window onto the soul of the enigmatic Mishima.	2004-09-15

Despite Truss's \\"no tolerance\\" claim, she is willing to point out that punctuation rules are far from consistent; what was commonplace fifty years ago would be laughed at today (for example, could you imagine someone writing \\"to-morrow\\"?).  Many issues are simply a matter of style (the \\"Oxford comma\\" or the optional \\"s\\" in \\"Truss's\\") or determined by which side of the Atlantic you're from.  Truss may state which she prefers, or uses, but rarely does she call one right and the other wrong.<br /><br />For this reason among others, Truss's book will probably never replace any manuals of style- but even if it simply causes people to be more aware of punctuation then I think it's a worthwhile book.  I will never roam the streets with an apostrophe on a stick, yelling \\"Sticklers unite!\\" but if awareness of this book results in fewer \\"Book's\\" or mixed up \\"whose/who's\\" and \\"its/it's\\", I for one will be a happier person.

Although skeptical about which Card would show up for \\"First Meetings\\", I was nevertheless reeled in by the \\"Ender\\" name.<br /><br />Fortunately I was not let down.  In fact, I was left hungry for more.  This feeling is probably both the plus and the minus of this book.  Here's what I mean:<br /><br />For the first time since Ender's Shadow, Card returns to what he does best: creating a suspenseful plot and engaging characters living in a world that is both fantastical and familiar.  The short stories about Ender's father were interesting: in \\"The Polish Boy\\" John Wiggin follows in the footsteps of Ender and Bean as the wunderkind lead character (Card's specialty), and sets up \\"Teacher's Pest\\" nicely by setting the stage for the chance (or is it?) meeting of Ender's parents.<br /><br />The original \\"Ender's Game\\" novella was remarkable for its similarity to what would become the full length \\"Ender's Game\\" novel.  As a sidenote, if you haven't read the novel, wait to read \\"First Meetings\\" until after you've read it!<br /><br />I personally enjoyed \\"The Investment Counselor\\" the most; it nicely fits in the wide gap between Child Genius Ender of \\"Ender's Game\\" and Empty Shell Ender of the following trilogy (ok, I'll be upfront: after Ender's Game I thought the following trilogy was a bit of a letdown).<br /><br />At the same time, I couldn't help but wish Card had fleshed out these stories into full length novels, particularly \\"The Investment Counselor\\" which could've developed nicely into a nice story involving arguably the three most interesting characters in the Ender universe: young Ender, Valentine, and Jane.  With the brevity of these stories, especially with the cartoonish graphics, when I finished the book I was both happy to have been able to re-enter Ender's world, but also a bit disappointed at finding it a bit watered-down.  I did not read it expecting another \\"Ender's Game\\", but I hoped it would at least measure up to \\"Ender's Shadow\\".  My advice to Mr. Card: do for these novellas what you did for the original \\"Ender's Game\\": make them into full-length novels!!!ed at finding it a bit watered-down.

The larger-than-life personae in this book and the general course of the novel draws immediate comparisons to F. Scott Fitzgerald, and of course while such comparisons will come up short, Mysteries of Pittsburgh is an enjoyable, artfully constructed book full of unforgettable characters.<br />The themes central to this story- love, ambition, uncertainty of oneself as an individual, the futility of running away from one's personal demons to name a few- are more fully developed in Chabon's later works, but they are no less a presence in Mysteries in Pittsburgh.  Others have been a bit dismissive of the &quot;first novel&quot; label on this book, but still when looking at a book and at an author it is important to recognize where he or she started creatively and what direction they have moved in.  As such, while Mysteries of Pittsburgh is not Chabon's greatest work by any means, it is a good start to the rest of his books and even on its own merits, is certainly worth the time taken to read it.	2004-03-29
US	50184447	R28CCPG8AP4A15	081120118X	988705640	Confessions of a Mask	Books	4	49	52	N	N	Good starting point into the world of Mishima	Reading other reviews of Confessions of a Mask, I see that many readers are looking at it from a perspective of \\"gay literature\\" and seem disappointed that Mishima is not really a supporter of the cause.  But from my perspective, as someone interested in Mishima as a giant in Japanese literature, Confessions of a Mask is a great introduction into the literary world of Mishima Yukio.<br /><br />Without giving away too much, the main forces that propel the protagonist in this semi-autobiographical work, are a secret lust for masculine beauty and an attempt at heterosexual \\"normalcy\\" attempted mainly through a painfully flawed try at loving a sister of his friend.  Other reviewers have commented that the second half of the story flags a bit, but for me, the frustration and concealed emotion that is tangible in the conversations between the protagonist and Sonoko is both convincing and intriguing.<br /><br />However, I would agree that the first half of the book is probably more interesting.  Mishima's work is less about homosexuality (with the emphasis on sex) and more about an almost reverent approach toward masculine virtue and beauty.  These ideas and the struggle within the protagonist start to flag as the war draws to an end and he becomes involved with Sonoko.<br /><br />I have yet to read many of Mishima's works, but the two main things that appeal to me are his staunch commitment to an ideal or perfection of some sort, and also the amazing penmanship that his stories exhibit.  As with most Japanese literature, this sort of subtle detail is lost in translation, so I encourage all who have the ability and time to read the originals!<br /><br />Although I have a feeling this book will be hard-pressed to please everyone, for me at least it seems like a great insight into the mind and the works of Mishima.  No study of modern Japanese literature would be complete without a look at Mishima, and although Confessions of a Mask may not be his greatest work, it is unquestionably an excellent starting point.tionably an excellent starting point.	2004-02-09

The writing is fresh and informative, the practical information is up to date and helpful, and the data is accurate.  For the amount of material covered, the depth is amazing ... From Hokkaido to the islands of Okinawa you can navigate the entire country with just this book.  And not just \\"navigate\\", but plan what to see, where to eat, and where to stay with a variety of options.<br />The main complaints previous reviewers have concern the occasional mistake and the lack of pictures.  Of course, when you try to summarize an entire country in a thousand pages there will be mistakes and omissions, and of course information will go out of date.  Which is why you should always double check your sources, or be prepared to roll with the punches.  Most places have websites and even the smallest cities in Japan have at least a little bit of tourist information in English.  If you're spending the time and money to come all the way to Japan, what does it hurt to spend a little bit of extra time on the internet double checking the details on places you want to see.<br />The same goes for pictures.  Personally, I'd rather wait until I get to a place and see for myself what something looks like, but when it comes to pictures (or maps) the internet is a treasure trove of information.<br />No matter how well you plan things, there will always be hangups.  Traffic is bad.  A place you want to see is taking the day off.  A bar you want to go to has closed its doors.  The best you can do is get as much information ahead of time and hope for the best.  From my experience living in Japan, if you are going to rely on one main source for your travel information in Japan, use the Rough Guide.  It's better than anything else out there.	2004-02-04
US	50184447	R1OB16J3SAQXSA	4770029047	87490493	Almost Transparent Blue	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Trippy	When Almost Transparent Blue came out in the late seventies, it was an important piece of literature and an important milestone in Japanese fiction.  Almost Transparent Blue is not simply about drugs and sex; in fact the chilling but fascinating aspect of Murakami's writing style is how remarkably detached his protagonist is from the actions that he and the people around him are doing.  This is a significant change from Coin Locker Babies, a book with similar themes, but much more proactive and passionate characters.  This rift between what is real and surreal becomes more in focus as the story continues, and the book reaches its climax when the protagonist, in a self-induced semi-hallucinogenic state, realizes that the reality that exists in the surreal world (primary, the Bird's world) is much more real and urgent than the drugs and sex in the \\"real\\" world around him.<br />While this book is still relevant today, as there is still an unnamable but nevertheless constant pressure on the youth of Japan (and around the world), the context it exists in has changed quite a bit.  Ryu's world is not quite the world of today, and ATB is beginning to show its age.  Nevertheless, Almost Transparent Blue is a very enjoyable book, and by the end it becomes clear that it is a much deeper and mature book than first meets the eye.	2003-10-21

Up Country is a very different type of book, and it is very evident that DeMille has actively put himself in the shoes of Paul Brenner.  The result is a tale that is personal and has an unusually intense focus on the two main characters: Brenner and the mysterious Susan Weber.<br />In fact, the vast majority of the book--including the 500-some pages between the first and second encounter between Brenner and the persistent Colonel Mang--consists almost purely of travel commentary with very little to do with actually solving the crime at hand.  As someone who is too young to have been around for the Vietnam War, this travelogue was interesting, although at times I wished DeMille would just get on with it.<br />A further departure from the typical elements of the genre was the ending, which was fairly ambiguous and left it up to the reader to create an ending.  The absence of a &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending was a nice change from the norm and sets up interesting possibilities for some kind of sequel.<br />Overall, Up Country was a very enjoyable book even if it was slightly unconventional.  Plodding and methodical at times, but the periods of action and confrontation were unforgettable.  The realities of war and lingering feelings in a country halfway around the world are subjects relevant now more than ever.	2003-07-12

The familiar cast of characters returns (with some memorable additions!) and Rowling fleshes out these characters and their personalities even further than she has done in her past books.  The same goes for the plot: it is more intricate and layered than any of her books to date.  Harry and company are faced with difficult decisions in a world that is increasingly grey, as distinctions between good and bad, right and wrong become as unclear as ever.<br />Best of all, this book maintains the magical quality, impressive depth, and mystical attraction that has become the standard for the Harry Potter series.  The book is almost 1000 pages, but I will imagine most readers, if they are like me, will not be able to put it down until they are finished.  Please, Ms. Rowling: don't make us wait another three years for the continuation of this saga!<br />Another excellent book!	2003-06-22

Anyone who has lived in Japan knows that Kerr hits the nail on the head time and time again with his penetrating observations of Japan.  As other reviewers have commented, this is not Japan bashing ... it is simply the truth that Japanese bureaucrats hope nobody notices.<br />For the Japanese and for others who are some way connected to Japan, this book should hopefully serve as a wake up call to the problems that are going on in Japan.  Like Kerr, while hoping for change I too find it hard to be optimistic about Japan.  It will likely take some social revolution of some kind for this to take place.  But it should be noted that the two main turning points in Japan's modern history: the Meiji Restoration and World War II was more a change in form than in function.  Power merely moved from the one group of bureaucrats to another while the country has largely functioned with the idea of putting industry first, people last.  I can't help but think that it will take some dramatic event, some effective leader to turn events around.  The fate of Japan and its role in 21st century Asia will be an important issue to keep track of.  It is my hope that Japan rediscovers itself and emerges from its current economic and cultural recession, but it will take some sacrifices to do so.<br />Kerr's book is heavy and it is full of passion but he backs up his arguments well with facts and anecdotes.  Dogs and Demons should be required reading for anyone interested in any aspect of Japan, be it business, pop culture, or traditional arts.  I look forward to Kerr's future insights as well.  Excellent book.	2003-06-15

As always, Irving created a memorable cast of characters and a plot that is both interesting and well-researched.  Cider House is not only a great story, but a great commentary on the issue of abortion.<br />The only thing that keeps me from giving Cider House 5 stars is my disappointment with Homer Wells as an adult.  As a child, Homer seems fated to have some kind of terrible destiny (like Owen Meany) but when it comes down to it, Homer never truly made a decision on his own until the end of the book.  His life as a youth is orchestrated by the opposing forces of Dr. Larch (my favorite person in the book) and Melony ... his love for Candy controls the next 15 ... and finally it is his decision to help Rose Rose that gets him back to St. Cloud's ... but even then it's under a fake name, and again even this is largely instigated by the guilt that Melony makes him feel.  Homer never escapes his destiny as an orphan who seems largely deprived on any free will of his own.  He's the \\"Right\\" Man ... the guy who agrees with everyone without being committal.<br />Overall Cider House is a very good book ... but I couldn't help but think that a slightly stronger main character would've made the story more cohesive.  Homer struggles with the question of whether he is the hero of his own life ... I would without hesitation say no: it is Dr. Larch.  Still, a good book, but probably not Irving's best.	2003-06-06
US	50184447	R2VXZGWAUZIZXB	0151008116	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	5	3	4	N	N	An incredible physical and spiritual journey	Life of Pi is an outstanding story: I think the greatest proof this is the wide variance in reviews here at Amazon.com.  Some people loved it, some people hated it, some people loved parts that other people hated and vice versa.  I personally loved it, but I think that some people are missing some of the main points of the story.  Just as Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea is not a simple adventure story about an old man catching and losing a fish, \\"Life of Pi\\" is not just a simple survival story about a boy and a tiger.  It's not about religion.  It's about spirituality and one's perspective on existence.<br />The book starts by fleshing out the character of Pi Patel and the impact that religion and spirituality (much to the confusion of the people around him) have on his life.  The reader is drawn in to Pi's world due to Yann's natural storytelling ability.  Chapter 21 is one of the key chapters to the story, where Yann/Pi first brings up the idea of the \\"better story.\\"  Chapter 22 is no less key, as Yann/Pi very briefly but powerfully discusses the very different interpretation of the \\"story\\" of life by an atheist and by an agnostic.<br />The middle of the story details Pi's shipwreck experience with a simple vividness that rivals Hemingway.  I was enthralled by this story as well, but others felt this part dragged on.  But the key is that, although it takes up the bulk of the text, Pi's adventure at sea is NOT the key to understanding this story.  Yes, it is a great example of physical and spiritual endurance, but it is not the true heart of this story.  The first clue is the fact that Yann/Pi tells us very early that Pi survives and there is a \\"happy ending.\\"  Why give this away unless Yann is trying to tell us that this is not the point of the story?  The true key to this story, which is not fully revealed until Chapter 99, is how you as the reader interpret this story.  Of the two stories that Pi tells to the Japanese investigators, which do YOU think is the \\"better story\\"? (this key term appears again here)<br />I would invite all of the people who did not enjoy this story or did not enjoy parts of it, to re-read the book with that question in mind.  This is a very personal story.  Life of Pi is an amazing tale of adventure, but an even more powerful agent of self-reflection.  If you haven't read it, go out and read it.  Life of Pi is an unforgettable ride.tter story\\"?

This book should be required reading for anyone who's lived in Japan, anyone who's interested in Japan, or even anyone who thinks all there is to Japan is samurai and geisha (or alternatively, anime and Pokemon).  Lost Japan is very reminiscent of Jun'ichiro Tanizaki's &quot;In Praise of Shadows&quot;: they are both works lamenting a disappearing Japan, and both are told in a series of seemingly unrelated essays and anecdotes.  Unfortunately, as several reviewers have mentioned already, sometimes Kerr goes to the point that his stories are so self-focused that they detract from the big picture.  The entire chapter on literati, for example, did not add much to the story for me at least.  However, overall Kerr's style is a success.<br />What impressed me the most with this book is how well Kerr was able to avoid falling into the easy traps of Japan Bashing or Japan Worship.  It is obvious that he loves Japan, but at the same time his vision is clear enough so that he can view Japan objectively and speak hard truths.  Most likely, any reader of this book who has been to Japan for any period of time found themselves nodding along to many parts of this book that were both critical of and in praise of modern Japan.  Kerr says so many things that seem so obvious, and yet they feel so novel because the Japanese themselves have not publicly admitted that there are serious, fundamental problems in contemporary society.  The sad thing is that it has been about a decade since Kerr's essays were published in Japan and it is questionable whether Japan has made any real progress in that time.  To that end, I look forward to reading Dogs and Demons to see how Kerr's thoughts have changed in the interim after writing Lost Japan.<br />I did not agree with everything Kerr had to say, but I found his arguments and ideas stimulating and fresh.  I hope Japan pulls itself out of its cultural and economic recession soon, but as Kerr hints at, a mere decade is no cause for panic in a country where events are measured in centuries and millennia.  Japan has suffered worse destruction in its past; here's hoping that the difficulties of the past decade will be made worth it with the rebirth of a new Japan that is able to combine features of its past with the realities of the present.ts cultural and economic recession soon, but as Kerr hints at, a mere decade is no cause for panic in a country where events are measured in centuries and millennia.

The ending is a bit unexpected, but then again, given the liberating power of literature, it is not a total surprise that Little Seamstress undergoes a metamorphosis and leaves her cocoon.  As heartbreaking as it is for the boys, if she had stayed where she was it would be almost like a betrayal to the liberating ideas she learned through Balzac.<br />Sijie blends humor, romance, and beauty together to create a book that is unforgettable and impossible to put down.  It is lamentable how short-sighted and misguided China's &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; was, and it is amazing that Sijie could spin this touching of a tale from that hard and unforgiving period.  &quot;Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress&quot; is a must read.	2003-05-02
US	50184447	R1ML5CCZB20NNW	4770023081	326209559	Coin Locker Babies: Japan's Modern Writers	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Interesting perspective on life and destruction	Ryu Murakami's \\"Coin Locker Babies\\" reminded me a lot of works by Chuck Palahniuk.  The nihilistic belief that all people are \\"unnecessary\\" and the anarchist belief that all things are created to be destroyed are strong themes that run through out the book.  At the same time, there is a strong desire to live (symbolized by the elusive but extremely powerful sound of a beating heart) that complements and at the same time counterbalances the urge to destroy.<br />This was my first encounter with Ryu Murakami, and I was impressed with his unique mastery of Japanese prose.  I was surprised to read the Publisher's Weekly review above that attaches words like \\"rambling\\" and \\"whimsy\\" to this book ... if the translation came off that way then it is the fault of the translator.  Murakami's world is a perpetual summer-hot, sticky, sweaty, the characters always hot, vivid, full of directionless energy ... anything but whimsical.  I am puzzled as to the use of the word \\"Toxitown\\" to describe what (in the original) is much more soberly called Drug Island.  The sections where Murakami \\"rambles\\" ... the scene with Anemone and the taxi driver stands out the most ... is entirely by design, and is carried out to great success.  It is the taxi driver, not Murakami, who rambles.  The structure of the last half of the book is my only real stylistic complaint: to me at least, the first half of the book (up until Kiku shoots his mother) moved along at a perfect pace, brilliantly drawing the reader into the world of Kiku and Hashi.  Then the pace just seemed to die.  Kiku languished in jail while Hashi entered into his own destructive phase before he is briefly thrown into a psychiatric ward toward the end of the book.  In my opinion at least, Murakami would've been better served spending less time with Kiku while he was in jail and more after he escaped; alternately with Hashi, it would have been more interesting to have spent less time with Hashi as a singer and more time in the psychiatric hospital.  Furthermore, Anemone and Niva all but disappear as unique, individual characters.  It was almost as if Murakami started to focus in on the central themes of his story to the point that the story itself began to lose direction.<br />The themes that Murakami introduces are interesting, again, very reminiscent of Palahniuk.  Kiku and Hashi are abandoned in coin lockers in Yokohama Station soon after birth, and grow up to feel unnecessary and at the same time, feel an uncontrollable energy and rage at society itself.  Almost like saying \\"if you don't need me, I don't need you either.\\"  The coin lockers themselves are a central image in the story, as they represent modern society at large: the concrete and metal \\"womb\\" that has no need for the person inside.  I disagree with Murakami's premise that all things are created in order to be destroyed, but this is still an admittedly powerful force throughout the book.  Almost paradoxically, the strong desire to live, to survive is a common theme as well.<br />What kept me from giving this book 5 stars was simply what seemed to me to be the pointlessness and predictability of all the destruction at the end.  Reading this book after witnessing the events in the world the last few years makes it admittedly hard to not feel slightly nauseated at the disregard for human life displayed by Hashi (until the end) and Kiku, in particular.  None of us are born into ideal situations ... all of us are \\"coin locker babies\\" to one degree or another ... but I do not buy into the theory that in order to live it is necessary to kill and destroy, be it in the real world or in literature.  Kiku and Hashi grow up, but it is questionable whether they really mature.  If they don't, what was the point for hanging around with them for 400 pages other than to just experience their wild adventures and hear their philosophy?<br />Despite this ambiguity, Coin Locker Babies was a thought provoking and well written book.

The highlight of his movies and comic books is usually the story itself, but in the case of Spirited Away, I think it would be fair to say that the sheer beauty and imagination of the film is just as amazing as the story itself.<br />For me, Spirited Away was by far the first, and to date only, animated movie that I could call visually stunning. The viewer, be he or she 5, 25, or 65 is as drawn into Miyazaki's world as the protagonist Chihiro is. This book allows you to revisit the movie through its art. Full of concept sketches, character designs, and backgrounds from the movie, this book also includes an introduction by Miyazaki himself as well as frequent commentary by the artists that worked on this film and even an explanation of some of the technology that helped make this such a visually appealing film. The book's price may seem a bit steep, but at around 250 full color, high quality pages I felt I more than got my money's worth.<br />There has been talk of Miyazaki retiring, but I hope this is not the case. With Spirited Away gaining such popular and critical acclaim in the United States, I hope he continues to work his magic for years to come, continuing to make his impression left not only on Japan, but to the global audience. With the increase in animation technology and the continuing strength of Miyazaki's imagination and storytelling power, it seems that the best is yet to come.	2003-04-09

Even though I consider myself an advanced learner of Japanese, I have not felt the need to buy a \\"Japanese\\" Kanji dictionary yet: this one by Spahn and Hadamitzky has more than met my needs.  Here are some of this dictionary's plusses:<br />-Just about every kanji or kanji compound you can think of is included (they claim 47,000+ compounds which sounds about right).<br />-The look-up system is easy to use, and the index is similarly helpful<br />-The appendices are surprisingly interesting and informative, including information ranging from the reigns of the emperors to geography to even a list of the most frequent Japanese surnames.<br />My only possible complaints are:<br />-not enough radicals: they chose to categorize the kanji using 79 radicals instead of the 214 historical radicals.  This resulted in almost 300 kanji that are \\"without\\" a radical, all lumped together at the beginning of the dictionary by the number of strokes.  Many of these are very common kanji, which can cause frustrations if you're trying to figure out which radical to look up only to find that it's in the \\"no radical\\" section.<br />-it would have been great if they'd had accent markings to show how the characters are pronounced.  In Japanese, context and an accent shift are the only difference between saying \\"Let's have success!\\" and \\"Let's have sex!\\" (sex and success are both romanized \\"seikoo\\").  Native Japanese presumably know the difference in pronunciation, but learners of a second language are not as likely.  This can result in awkward situations.  Knowing the correct accent in general makes you much more understandable, and it is a shame that most dictionaries don't include this information.<br />Overall though, this is a great dictionary.  I highly recommend it for beginners, experts, and everyone in between!	2003-04-09

This is not just a great piece of Japanese Canadian literature, this is a great book, period.  The Internment of Japanese American/Canadian citizens during World War II is a subject that is widely unknown, and a topic that few novelists have been able to capture with as much skill as Kogawa.<br />&quot;Obasan&quot; weaves a seamless tale that stretches between generations and spans continents and decades with an almost dreamlike quality.  As other reviewers have commented (lamented?) about, there are many dream sequences, all of which have significance as the story is unveiled.  The dreams, the &quot;silence that cannot speak,&quot; the love that is voiceless and yet vivid, the grief that cries out loudly and yet unheard ... the power of Kogawa's writing lies in being able to interpret and experience this imagery, and feel the pain of the internment as if doing so first hand.<br />I was surprised to see the number of negative reviews this book has received here ... I feel compelled to include my voice with those who thoroughly recommend this book.  &quot;Obasan&quot; is the best novel on the internment I have yet to come across, and certainly among the most powerful books I have read.  Although Kogawa writes of a silence that does not speak, she breaks the silence beautifully with &quot;Obasan,&quot; revealing a history that many do not know, and many do not talk about.  This is a story that must be remembered and retold ... so history does not repeat itself.	2003-02-18

Specifically, her position as a Nisei daughter -- child of first generation Japanese Americans -- is the focus of this tale.<br />The disappointing thing about this book is how obviously self-censored the book is.  Sone very briefly reveals deeply felt rage and resentment at intervals during the book, only to shake them off and quickly change to a more light-hearted topic.  Granted, there is an ironic tone to many of her comments and situations, and again granted, she is writing for a post-war audience that probably would not be receptive to outspoken criticism of the Internment, but still Sone seems to sugar coat the experience just a bit too much for my tastes.  By the end, with the patriotic speeches that make it sound like the Internment was as much the fault of the Japanese Americans as it was the government, I was getting a little tired of Sone's carefree and apologetic tone, especially after the highly charged preface.  In the book, Sone all but thanks the government for interning her and her family and giving them this character-building experience.<br />If you are truly interested in the internment and the impact it had on the Japanese Americans, try a book like Joy Kogawa's &quot;Obasan.&quot;  It's written about the Japanese Canadian experience, which was even more extreme than the Japanese American one.  Kogawa also experienced internment first hand, but &quot;Obasan&quot; is written far enough after the fact that Kogawa is able to give the story more perspective and is able to put a more honest face on what really happened.<br />Nisei Daughter is not a bad book by any means ... but it did not live up to my expectations either.  Sone's self-conscious editing makes the story seem much more like a novel than the autobiography that it supposedly is.

Exhibit A: \\"Empire of Signs.\\"<br /><br />That might be a little harsh. It might be better to say that Empire of Signs is an example of art for art's sake. Barthes claims to be attempting to isolate a number of features, treat them as signs, and create a system called Japan. Barthes does indeed make good on his promise (or is it a threat?) and paints a very vivid, creative system he calls Japan. He admits that he has little knowledge of Japan to begin with, and so his observations are primarily reflections of his own imagination and not the country that actually is called Japan.<br /><br />At this point red lights should be flashing and loud alarms should be going off in the reader's head: what Barthes admits to doing is exactly what he claims to abhor--Orientalism. Empire of Signs is a beautifully written, intelligent book (which is why I give it two stars instead of one), but by no means is it anything more than an essay on Japan According To Roland Barthes. Furthermore, although Barthes claims to have an indifferent opinion toward Japan, it become clear right away that he is in love with Japan when he starts his odes to pachinko and his love poems for the chopstick. The good news is that Barthes doesn't seem to be taking himself too seriously: the tone of the book is light, almost stream-of-consciousness in style. I just can't help but shudder to think that there are people out there who are trying to think of Japan and the Japanese in terms of the ephemeral realms of the sukiyaki pot.<br /><br />For anyone interested in the Japanese perspective and analysis of the \\"signs\\" of Japan, I would recommend Jun'ichiro Tanizaki's \\"In Praise of Shadows\\" or books by Alex Kerr ... Edward Said's \\"Orientalism\\" is an interesting (if not a little dense and controversial) look at orientalism ... but if you really want to know a little more about this \\"Empire of Signs\\" that is Japan, pick up a travel guide. Better still, read some Japanese literature by Soseki, Tanizaki, Oe, or the contemporary writer Haruki Murakami.<br /><br />Roland Barthes' \\"Empire of Signs\\" is like a very rich chocolate cake: pretty to look at, but very difficult to finish without becoming slightly nauseous.  Imagine a high-brow \\"Dave Barry Does Japan\\" and that just about sums up \\"Empire of Signs\\" in this reviewer's humble opinion., pick up a travel guide.

It is clear that Murayama himself experienced many of the things that his protagonist does, as his commentary on plantation life, reactions to the Pearl Harbor bombing, the traditional Japanese family system, and the importance of filial piety rings strong and true.  Perhaps my only complaint about this book was its brevity, I wish Murayama would've gone into more detail at points, and the ending itself seemed a little too pat given the hardships the family had gone through together for years (decades really).  I found myself wanting to know what Kiyoshi would have done had he not suddenly figured out the key to craps and freed his family from debt through gambling.  After following his own beliefs into the army, would he have been willing or able to settle for plantation life again after the war?<br />One of the more interesting aspects of the book is the confidence all of the characters have in themselves as individuals.  In contrast to John Okada's \\"No-No Boy,\\" where the protagonist spends the entire novel searching for an identity (rather than feeling Japanese or feeling American he feels largely empty instead), that is not an issue in this story.  Kiyoshi has a very strong family and community structure around him.<br />All I Asking for Is My Body is an excellent book, told very effectively through the eyes of a perceptive nisei who is often in difficult situations and forced to make tough choices.  The experience of plantation workers in Hawaii is an oft-overlooked aspect of American history, but Murayama does a great job of bringing the time period to life again with a fluidity and grace that makes this story memorable and easy to understand, even for today's readers, who are removed from the time and place of this novel's action.	2003-01-24
US	50184447	R1X1JZF72ZKAQ4	0345361792	438809520	A Prayer for Owen Meany	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Intelligent and Engaging	This is the second book of Irving's that I've read, \\"The World According to Garp\\" being the first. A Prayer For Owen Meany is slower than Garp and not as roll-on-the-ground-funny (although it does has its hilarious moments: the Christmas Pageant brought tears to my eyes I laughed so hard). In \\"Garp\\", Irving asks: why can't something serious be funny as well. In \\"Owen Meany\\", he continues along that vein and ends up tackling the issue of faith in the modern world. As other reviewers have said, Irving is not preachy, nor is he arrogant. He is cynical (or perhaps just honest?) about organized religion and the ending of the book is open to several interpretations.<br />A Prayer For Owen Meany is a book about faith, but it is also a book about friendship. In addition, Irving also delves into politics and analyzes the Vietnam War and the Reagan era. Even if you have little interest in religion or politics, do not let that discourage you from reading this book. \\"Owen Meany\\" is a truly universal tale and a masterpiece of modern literature. Don't miss out on reading this book if you haven't read it already: Irving will blow you away.	2003-01-06

For readers familiar with James Clavell's \\"Shogun\\", William Adams is the man that \\"Anjin-san\\" is based on.<br />The main problem I had with this book is Milton's nearly complete absence of Japanese sources.  Adams' appearance and involvement in Japanese politics must have provoked rather significant reactions from the leading Japanese leaders of the time, but Milton sadly does not deal with this story from the Japanese side at all.  Additionally, in the British edition of this book at least, there are several mistakes regarding the Japanese culture and the language.  Most humorously, he refers to \\"bannermen\\" as \\"hamamoto\\" when he means \\"hatamoto.\\"  A \\"hamamoto\\" might best be called a \\"beachman,\\" which I assume Milton did not intend.  Hopefully this type of mistake was caught before the American version was printed.  I would imagine many of these mistakes are due to Milton's over-reliance on old European sources and unfamiliarity with the Japanese culture.<br />Milton is clearly a writer first and a historian second.  As such, the line between fact and fiction is somewhat vague at times.  Nevertheless, this is a very interesting book.  Just remember that it is not always an entirely accurate one.	2003-01-06

Tanizaki's suggestion that these inclinations came from practical origins made sense (a lot better than the still-common theory that the Japanese idea of aesthetics is a result of different, Japanese genes).  It also seemed to me that the Japanese were more inclined to resign themselves to fate and find beauty in what was at hand (like the shadows) than to fight nature and create light at the expense of beauty.<br />What interested me most was the fact that Tanizaki has a &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality, not so much that Japan or the West is better than the other, just different.  However, it seems that if a young Japanese person were to read this essay today, it would seem just as &quot;foreign&quot; as it does to an American.<br />Nevertheless, it was interesting to read Tanizaki's essay, which discusses everything from the theatre to the bathroom, gold and lacquer, women and race.  One cannot help but read Tanizaki's essay without feeling his loss at the erosion of traditional society and the innate beauty within it.  At the same time, it makes you look around and notice the lack of beauty in our everyday lives (in terms of art and architecture).  America, too, was once a land of shadows and a people who we probably able to appreciate their beauty.  Tanizaki probably never considered the fact that his culture and ours are really not so fundamentally different.<br />If you read this essay, don't get caught up in Tanizaki's occasional bad-mouthing of Western culture (remember that he probably would have never dreamed that this short essay would be translated and read in the West!)  Instead, treat this as a rare look into a common Japanese mindset and an opportunity to see for yourself whether Tanizaki's praise of shadows is a worthy one or not.	2002-12-11

Okada follows the story of Ichiro, a young Japanese-American who has just been released from prison for refusing to be drafted.  Ichiro meets many people along the way, people who color Ichiro's view of the world and of himself (the dying Kenji is probably the most memorable).  Ultimately, Ichiro realizes that the world will be what he makes of it: either he decides to live and love life, or he can become bitter and be destroyed (like his pal Freddie).<br />Throughout the entire story, Ichiro struggles with his identity as an individual.  Japan and the Japanese are as foreign to him as any other race, but ethnically he is Japanese.  He is as American as anyone else in the country, but he is cursed to be called a \\"Jap\\" simply because of his features.  Ichiro tries to deal with his guilt and the reality of a bigoted world while searching for some niche where he can live a good life.  During this process, Ichiro meets people of all races and backgrounds who ultimately convince him not to give up.  He has made a mistake, yes, but so did the government.  It will not be easy, but if he chooses to live, to keep dancing while the music is playing, he just might make it.<br />This was my first experience with Asian-American literature, and it was enlightening to read about all the confusion and all of the pent up rage contained within Ichiro.  The Japanese-Americans, perhaps more so than any other minority group in America, keep a low profile even now, so it was interesting to read Okada's story.  No-No Boy is a good story and provides a good look at the issues surrounding Japanese-Americans.	2002-12-09

It is clear that Murakami values his privacy intensely and Rubin goes to great lengths to respect that.  Also, what information is given about Murakami will pretty much conform with what you probably could've assumed about him.  This book, more than anything else, is a chronological literary criticism of Murakami's works up through \\"after the quake.\\"  Rubin does a good job of analyzing many of the running motifs and themes that occur in Murakami's books (wells, corridors, birds, and elephants, to name a few).  It is clear that Rubin has a hard time being a Murakami fan and a Murakami scholar at the same time, but he seems to do a good job remaining impartial (although it is clear which books are his favorites and which are not!)<br />My first experience with Murakami was when I read \\"A Wild Sheep Chase\\" a year and a half ago, and before I knew it I had read every major novel and short story he'd written, finishing Pinball 1973 just last week.  I read the books in an order that pretty much had nothing to do with the order they were written (beware that the order that the English translations came out in is often quite different than the original order).  As a result, reading the details Rubin gives behind each of the books and about the growth that Murakami experienced along the way were among the highlights of the book for me and helped to solidify the ties that hold his books together.  Murakami fascinates me because he is still growing rapidly as a writer and a person and the growing pains as well as the links to his past work are found in each work if you know what to look for.<br />Rubin spends the most time in this book discussing \\"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,\\" which for me was an incredibly thrilling and frustrating book at the same time.  Murakami had so many excellent storylines and so many running motifs, but many seemed to frazzle and die out by the end.  Some call this piece Murakami's masterpiece, but I have a feeling that when all is said and done, this will be seen as a transitional piece: the first work where Murakami fully takes on the responsibility he feels towards the Japanese people.  Murakami tackled so many issues with such brilliance (the Nomonhan Incident in particular) that I look forward to seeing where this new focus takes Murakami in the future.  Some of his more recent work (\\"Sputnik Sweetheart\\" comes to mind) seem more of a step backwards than real progress, but there is no way Wind-Up Bird is a mere aberration.<br />Perhaps more so than any other writer, we as readers have the interesting opportunity to watch Murakami grow and experiment before our very eyes.  If you haven't already, definitely try to get your hands on some of the earlier novels and short stories Rubin mentions (\\"Hear the Wind Sing\\" in particular) to get an even better grasp of where Murakami has started from.<br />If you are a serious fan of Murakami and want a better understanding of the thinking behind his works and a bit of an analysis of the works themselves (remember that as an individualist, Murakami believes his books have no one, strict interpretation!), \\"Haruki Murakami and the Music of Words\\" is a must-have companion to Murakami's works.

US	50184447	R1VLBZ0CBU3VP6	0870113674	324016438	Botchan	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Deceptively simple	Botchan is the third book I've read of Soseki's, and it was fun to read about the adventures and mishaps (mostly mishaps) that Botchan encounters in this tale.  Botchan is a fun, quick read that shows off Soseki's sense of humor and wit.<br />This having been said, it seems prudent to remember that Soseki himself said that Botchan should not be considered a Japanese &quot;ideal.&quot;  His naivete and straight-forwardness are no match for the calculated actions that get him and others ousted from the school.  With the final, humorous pummeling of Red-shirt and Clown, Soseki seems to be warning the reader that however heroic Botchan might be, his victories are hollow ones.  After all, Red-shirt might be left with a black eye, but he has gotten rid of his enemies and he is presumably left also with &quot;Madonna&quot; and a higher salary (the salaries of Botchan, Porcupine, and Green Squash have to go somewhere, as hinted by Red-shirt midway through the book).  So in the end, the bad guy gets the woman and the money and the good guy gets the slow boat home.  Not exactly the ideal situation for a hero.<br />The good news is that Botchan doesn't seem to realize that he's won the battle but lost the war.  Unlike other Soseki characters that have to undergo hardship in order to gain wisdom (Sensei in Kokoro comes to mind), it is hard to see Botchan really getting anything out of his experience in Shikoku.  Of course though, ignorance is bliss.<br />If Botchan is your first experience with Soseki, give &quot;Kokoro&quot; a try ... it is a much more serious book, but many of the same themes appear.  If you've read some of Soseki's later work but not Botchan, definitely take the time to read it.  Having experienced the themes of suffering and guilt that are so prevalent in his later works, you'll probably be able to enjoy Botchan's light humor even more.<br />Either way, Botchan is a fun read, and a different, informal facet of Soseki that the reader does not normally get to see.to see.	2002-12-02

This question, raised countless times by the main character Rodrigues, is just one of many theological issues that Endo explores in this highly emotional, extremely probing novel.  The Christian period of Japan is regarded as a somewhat curious anomaly by the Japanese themselves, and is largely unknown in western circles.  That Endo could weave so elegant a tale, using a foreign main character (there are few precedents in Japanese literature) and frequently changing narrative styles no less, is an accomplishment in itself.<br />&quot;Silence&quot; raises several theological points, but the two that stuck with me the most were the following: how can God remain silent despite the suffering of his people (a question no less relevant with the events going on in the world today), and secondly, is it possible that Christianity cannot &quot;grow roots&quot; in the &quot;swamp&quot; that is Japan.  A Catholic himself, it is obvious that Endo has struggled over these questions himself, searching for answers.  Is it possible to betray your faith but stay true to your God?  Endo's frank look at questions like this is part of his universal success.  It is amazing to consider that this book was a huge seller in Endo's native Japan, which itself is barely 1% Christian.<br />&quot;Father, you were not defeated by me,&quot; Inoue says to Rodrigues.  &quot;You were defeated by this swamp of Japan.&quot;  &quot;No, no ... my struggle was with Christianity in my own heart&quot; Rodrigues replies.  Ultimately, Christian or non-Christian, no matter your age or nationality, faith comes down to these battles in the heart.  Endo does a magnificent job depicting this, and Silence is an outstanding book because of it.	2002-11-04

Perhaps the best thing to say is that I had fun reading this book, and go from there.<br />This was my first encounter with Jonathan Carroll, and I was pleased to read a book that was both highly intelligent and at the same time original and laugh-out-loud funny.  As other reviewers have written, don't even bother trying to categorize this book ... trying to capture this book within one genre does it no justice.  The overall plot is science fiction-esque, with time travel and an idea of universal destiny which reminded me a lot of a favorite sci-fi book of mine: Arthur C. Clarke's &quot;Childhood's End.&quot;  At the same time, this book has a fast-paced, mind-bending surrealism about itself, and is written in a style that is pleasantly &quot;American,&quot; much like John Irving.<br />Clever, thrilling, and wild, The Wooden Sea is a contemporary classic.  A fun and thought-provoking read you don't want to miss out on.	2002-10-27

As a novel it's not bad, but the point is that this is not a novel about business, it's a business book in the form of a novel.  Goldratt's biggest strength as a writer showed when he explained his theories by using easy to understand examples.  Using the marching Boy Scouts to explain not only what a bottleneck is, but also what the implications of a bottleneck are, was great.  The exchanges between Jonah and Alex were similarly enlightening.<br />There really are not too many negatives about this book.  Just don't have too many expectations for this book as a novel (Goldratt is not the John Grisham or Tom Clancy of Operations Management). The ending was a little bit awkward too ... it's like Goldratt wanted to tackle the whole issue of divisional management but settled for a brief introduction to it instead.  I'm not familiar with his other books, but I hope he went into this topic into a little more depth somewhere: it would be interesting to read his theories on managing above the single-plant level.<br />To sum up, &quot;The Goal&quot; is a great book for anyone interested in business in general, operations management and the Theory of Constraints in particular.  A lot of his advice is common sense, which he admits, but that's the point: business is about setting a goal and running operations with that goal in mind. Don't let some of the more conventional measurements (cost and efficiency measurements in particular) distract you from that.	2002-10-22

This book--which is at times hilarious, absurd, heart-breaking, outrageous, and tender ... often all of them at once--is one of the most profound books I've read in a while.  As Garp described one of his own books, The World According to Garp is at once funny and serious, and above all it is \\"true.\\"  Irving often steps out of the bounds of what would normally be called common, or at least literary, decency, but the result is to remind us that the world we are living in is really an \\"X-rated soap opera,\\" just like Garp's, full of comedy and tragedy, love and loss.<br />\\"To be full of Garp is to be full of life!\\" writes one reviewer, and I could not agree more.  The World According to Garp was one of those books I wished would never end, but at the same time I was content with how it ended.  Well before the end of this book, Garp and his family felt like a part of my own.  If you have not read this book, what are you waiting for?  Go out and read it!  If you have read this book, count yourself fortunate: The World According to Garp is one of the most imaginative and enjoyable books out there.	2002-10-16

I was also surprised to find out that many of these stories were set in periods in Japanese history decades and sometimes centuries before his contemporary time. After seeing Tanizaki's obvious passion for stories such as \\"The Bridge of Dreams\\" and \\"A Blind Man's Tale\\" I can see how he would undertake the massive task of \\"translating\\" the ancient Tale of Genji into modern Japanese.<br />Getting back to this collection of tales, what impressed me most about Tanizaki's writing was his ability to completely immerse the reader in these tales, and to calmly narrate the intense and often abnormal passions of his characters. What interested me was that time and time again, the women in his stories had complete control over the men. In \\"A Portrait of Shunkin\\", an older man blinds himself for the sake of a blind musician so that she is not shamed by her disfigurement. In \\"The Bridge of Dreams\\", the narrator is devoted to his mothers (yes, mothers!) to the point that it seems as if he has aged without ever really growing up: he continues to dream about his mother and try to breast feed from his mother far after it is appropriate to do so (it is suggested that he goes even farther than this ... Freud would've loved this tale). The men in \\"The Tattooer\\" and \\"Aguri\\" seem to have their souls leeched from them by their women. \\"A Blind Man's Tale\\" is another obvious example of a man being dominated by a woman. These extremes of pain and beauty are probably accentuated the most in \\"The Tattooer\\", my favorite story of the seven.<br />Domination is not achieved just by the fact that they are women, but also by their intense beauty. A tattooer falls in love with a girl after just seeing her foot. Tanizaki is gifted enough to be able to describe the foot in such a manner that the reader also falls in love with the girl, by just reading about the foot. For me, this was what made Tanizaki's writing compelling: despite (or perhaps because of) a straight-forward, precise writing style, his stories were extremely passionate and sensual. Sensual is the best word I can think of. These aren't racy, graphically sexually oriented stories where the men are simply out to sleep with the women, but stories that emphasise and highlight the amazing beauty of women (and the cruelty and pain that often accompanies that beauty). In a world with a lot of sex and a lot less beauty, reading about the reverse was surprisingly refreshing. \\"Terror\\" and \\"The Thief\\" are obvious exceptions to the motif of beauty, as they deal with internalized fear and guilt, but the stories are no less powerful than his more sensual ones.<br />Reading these seven tales, which are amazingly diverse, and incredibly, completed in a span of time that covers nearly fifty years, and I now hope to have the chance to read a full length novel of Tanizaki's to see how he treats these themes that occur so frequently in his short stories in a novel.

The best explanation I can give is that his writing has such an innate vitality and originality that by just reading and reflecting on what he writes, as cliche as it might seem, I feel extraordinary happy to be alive.  Murakami's gift for writing is rivaled by few, and his works leave a unique impression on every person who reads them.<br />However, as a writer, Murakami appears to be going through an obvious transition, which seems to have started after Japan experienced &quot;the Quake&quot; and the Tokyo subway gas attacks.  Murakami's last few books (Sputnik Sweetheart in particular) have been extremely reflective, almost brooding.  The stories might be better technically than his earlier works, but they lacked something, that ironic humor, warmth, and spunk that his earlier stories, like Dance, Dance, Dance (my personal favorite) and Wind-Up Bird overflowed with.<br />On top of that, when I discovered that this book is not one story but a series of short stories, I was intrigued to see which Haruki would show up.  I was not disappointed.  The stories in this book combine the emotion, humor, and excitement of his earlier works with the reflection and beauty of his most recent books to result in great stories, and in a couple cases, awesome ones.<br />By far, my favorites in this collection were All of God's Children Can Dance and Honey Pie, but the other stories are excellent as well.  &quot;Landscape with Flatiron&quot; is the only story that didn't do a whole lot for me, but the other stories shine so brightly that that was only a minor detail for me at least.<br />I really hope that Murakami continues on in the direction he has started with in this collection of stories.  His next novel, Umibe no Kafuka (Kafka on the Shore) is due out in a week in Japan, and at 800+ pages (in the Japanese version) it's certainly his longest work in a while.  I can't wait to read it.	2002-09-05

Childhood's End goes a giant leap beyond that and opens the reader's eyes to the universe he or she is a part of.  For the most part we go through life day by day, dreaming of adventure but living a dull, eventless life.  For the first time in a long time, I was forced to think about how miraculous it is that we are here at all, and how mysterious the workings of time and the universe are.<br />More than anything else, this book made me wonder about our place in the universe.  Are we alone in the universe?  Or are we simply one of many races out there, and not very high on the totem pole at that? (the book compares humans to an &quot;Overmind&quot; the way we might compare an amoeba to us).  Either way, it makes the infighting we do amongst ourselves seem pretty pettty.<br />Childhood's End is not a complicated book, it certainly doesn't take long to read, but it is easily among the best works ever of science fiction.  I am amazed when I think that this book was written 50 years ago.  Change a few numbers and terms and this book could easily have been written today.  Given the fact that it was indeed written half a century ago, and that for the most part Clarke overestimated our accomplishments to date, it certainly puts things in perspective.  Here's to hoping that in real life, it doesn't take Overlords to put things in order on Earth!	2002-09-03

The story itself reminded me a bit of William Golding's Lord of the Flies (which was actually written a year AFTER Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids was published).  The major difference I found between the two books was the difference in where the authors placed the evil forces in their book: for Golding, the evil (the gaping void, the mouth of the \\"Lord of the Flies) was inside of each individual.  For Oe, the evil was in the system, the outside pressure from society on the group of young boys.  When outside forces intrude in Golding's book, chaos ends and civility is restored.  The opposite happens in this book.<br />Additionally, Golding's tale is an extremely universal one.  The boys in the book happen to be English, but there's no reason why they couldn't be American, Japanese, Brazilian, etc.  On the other hand, Nip the Buds is written with specific regard to its setting: wartime Japan.  Oe himself is surprised by his worldwide appeal: he says he writes to his fellow Japanese, his own generation in particular.  Several of the themes, including that of heartless, fickle villagers, is common to Japanese fiction (Kurosawa's \\"Seven Samurai\\" and Abe Kobo's \\"Woman in the Dunes\\" come to mind instantly).  This book in general is written with obvious scorn for senseless violence and specifically, Japan's role in World War II.  This is not to say that Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids can only be appreciated by elderly Japanese people (I certainly am not in either category).  But, as is often the case with Japanese literature, it's very important to try to understand the environment the author was living in and commenting on at the time.<br />Oe's writing is supposed to be a bit abrasive to the Japanese eye, but in translation at least, it was straight-forward and simple to read.  It would be easy to call Nip the Buds a graphic book, but journalistic might be a better term.  This book is told through the eyes of a youth who has seen it all.  He doesn't link ideas such as love and sex or violence and killing, but often treats them as completely separate ideas.  Despite the callousness in this book, there is a lot of emotion as well.  The reformatory kids' bond is solid (until the end), and the tie between the narrator and his younger brother, and the narrator and the girl is very real and vivid.  Seeing these bonds wrenched apart one by one until the narrator is completely alone at the end is part of the reason that Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids is such an amazingly powerful book.  Oe has created a truly unforgettable work.to call Nip the Buds a graphic book, but journalistic might be a better term.  This book is told through the eyes of a youth who has seen it all.

This is definitely not one of Soseki's better known novels, especially in the United States, but it still has an appeal and sharpness that transcends time and cultural barriers.<br />&quot;Sanshiro&quot; is in many ways both different and yet similar to Soseki's most famous work, &quot;Kokoro.&quot;  Both include tales of heartbreak and tragedy, along with social commentary on Japanese society.  For whatever reason, Sanshiro struck me as a much more &quot;modern&quot; book than Kokoro.  Using the word modern on a book written 100 years ago may seem odd, but reading Soseki's comments on Japanese society at the time (end of the 19th/beginning of 20th century Japan), then considering the ultimate result of the Meiji cultural &quot;revolution&quot; (the emphasis on Western science and Eastern philosophy which led to militaristic ultranationalism), and then again the state of Japan today and it is clear that Soseki's comments are not outdated.<br />Similarly, Sanshiro's Mineko is a much more modern, &quot;Western&quot; young lady than her counterpart in Kokoro.  Unlike Kokoro's Ojosan, who didn't seem to have a thought of her own, Mineko is beautiful, intelligent, slightly haughty, and has a mysterious appeal about her.  She is not some trophy to be captured, but a person to be respected in her own right.  I found myself verbally assaulting the annoyingly clumsy Sanshiro when he missed opportunity after opportunity to get to know Mineko better.  Of course, when he finally develops some guts it's too late.  The blame for this unhappy end falls on Mineko as well, as she is one of Sanshiro and Yojiro's generation's &quot;unconscious hypocrites&quot; in the words of Soseki.  Mineko knows that she has found a fellow stray sheep in Sanshiro, yet she ultimately abandons him.<br />Soseki's writing is again a joy to read.  Every time you encounter a passage that seems to start getting a little monotonous, he throws in a paragraph that seems absolutely brilliant.  The characters are similarly memorable.  I liked Kokoro a bit better, but Sanshiro is still an excellent book that has aged well.s in a paragraph that seems absolutely brilliant.  The characters are similarly memorable.

Fight Club does not glorify anarchy or encourage mass destruction.  Palahniuk does his best to shock and stimulate the reader, not to encourage violence, but to open his or her eyes and stop living complacent, misguided lives.  He likes the seemingly paradoxical idea of achieving self-awareness through self-destruction.  Only by hitting rock bottom can one rise to the top.<br />Fight Club is of course the extreme example of this case, and Palahniuk's warning about extending self-destruction to destruction of others and full-blown anarchy is loud and clear.  Palahniuk's goal is to force you to open your eyes and ask yourself: what are you living for?  What are your goals in life?  If you had only one more day to live, what would you do?  And why aren't you doing those things right now?  Self-realization is not anarchy.  Neither is seeing things for what they are, not what popular culture tells you to believe.<br />Palahniuk's philosophy, evident in his other writings as well, is laid out toward the end of Fight Club: \\"We are not special.  We are not crap or trash, either.  We just are.\\"  On top of that, we \\"just are\\" for a short period of time.  Palahniuk's point: Don't waste that time by living a \\"safe\\" life, or a life dictated by others.  Love life, and live life.	2002-08-24
US	50184447	R28PIBOTZIR4C4	0688175376	85549901	Angry White Pyjamas: A Scrawny Oxford Poet Takes Lessons From The Tokyo Riot Police	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Unique Tale	I would think that two groups of people in particular would find this book interesting: 1) People who have lived in Japan, and 2) People who have studied martial arts (aikido in particular).<br />I only qualify for the first category, but I still enjoyed this book.  I certainly have new respect for anyone who can devote themselves to aikido, or any other martial art.  The author has no concrete reason to start his study other than a realization that you only get one shot at life: \\"this is it\\" the author says in a moment of epiphany reminiscent of Chuck Palahniuk's \\"Fight Club.\\"<br />The author enters the dojo knowing he'll have to work hard.  Once he joins the Riot Police Course he really knows he has to work hard.  With a mixture of madness, religious fervor, and perspiration, Twigger manages to survive the course.  I can see where hard-core aikido artists might look down on Twigger's attitude to just \\"survive\\" the course instead of putting his whole being into it, but the point of the book is not Twigger's transformation into an aikidoka but instead what he gets out of the intense course.  In fact, I don't think Twigger says if he even enters a dojo again after finishing the senshusei course.  What is important is that Twigger was able to apply what he learned in the dojo in his everyday life, in how he changed his teaching strategy for example.<br />Several other reviewers have mentioned how this book was oddly inspiring, and I would certainly agree with them.  This is the story about a year in the life of a completely ordinary guy experiencing an extraordinary challenge, and coming out victorious.  This doesn't mean everyone should run out to a dojo and learn a martial art, but it is a unique spin on the old lesson to dream big, endure hardship, and accomplish your goal.	2002-08-24

Herbert's writing style was a joy to read, as he managed to find the delicate balance between detail and brevity, resulting in a fluid tale with both depth and raw emotion.  What makes books like Dune and the Lord of the Rings series so great is that their respective worlds seem completely natural and real to the reader.  Add some great action, plot twists, and wonderfully fleshed out characters, and you have a masterpiece of not just science fiction, but modern literature as well.  The incredible epic of the Muad'Dib, the deadly beauty of Arrakis and its inhabitants ... Dune is a novel I will never forget.	2002-08-11

Count me among the latter.<br />I didn't know what to expect when I picked up this book.  I was pleasantly surprised by Golding's depth and sharp insight.  Despite the youth of its main characters, Lord of the Flies is not some juvenile adventure novel.  Golding's bleak commentary on the absolute evil (the \\"Lord of the Flies\\") that lies in our hearts, waiting for just the slightest opportunity to throw civilization into chaos is chilling and powerful.<br />I hope that those people who read this book in high school go back and read it again later in life, especially those who did not like it.  Lord of the Flies is not an exercise in finding symbolism and motifs ... it's about understanding the point that Golding makes through his story.  Lord of the Flies is clearly one of the more compelling and intense books I've read in a long time.  I highly recommend it.	2002-08-02

One of the major knocks on this book seems to be that Palahniuk has rehashed territory that he's covered before, but as a first-timer to Palahniuk, I was simply blown away.  Perhaps Choke was old hat for people who've read Palahniuk before, but for me at least it was an eye-opener.<br />&quot;Anarchist&quot; is a word that seems to be attached to Palaniuk, but I think insightful might be a better word.  He is able to see the world as a realist, albeit a joyfully cynical one.  Palahniuk's idea of Jamais vu-where everybody is a stranger no matter how well you think you know them-interested me in particular because of how true I believe it is.  Our parents, friends, children, co-workers ... no matter how well we may think we know each other, what do we really know?  How well do we even know ourselves for that matter?<br />Choke was as entertaining as it was thought-provoking.  I found myself laughing out loud again and again.  If Choke wasn't so hilarious it would be downright mortifying.  Palahniuk certainly pulls no punches.  The plot twist at the end- &quot;jamais vu all over again&quot;- left me amazed.<br />The general concensus seems to be that if you've read Palahniuk before, this book will be a familiar foray into chaos.  If you are like me and are only familiar with Palahniuk through the movie Fight Club (and liked it), I highly recommend Choke.  An unforgettable read.	2002-07-26

I think it's even a stretch to call it \\"science\\" fiction: more of a future political fiction instead.  Think of it as the game of Risk on steroids.<br />That might be an oversimplification, but many times that's what the story feels like: a game.  The players are Bean, Achilles, and Peter (and Petra and other Battle School alums to a lesser extent).  The book centers around how they use their power (and sometimes, lack of power) in a struggle for world domination.  The detail of, say, a Tom Clancy novel is left out, but the human side is more developed than a typical military/historical fiction.<br />Card's afterward is interesting to read as well.  I'm glad that he decided to spend more time on Bean's extraction of Petra, although I think Card might've been well served to spend just a little bit more time on it, as the interaction between Achilles and Petra seemed to end right after Petra beats him up.  Maybe Achilles was busy negotiating with China.  Maybe Card just didn't know where to go from there and shifted his focuses elsewhere.  Who knows.  I was a little disappointed with how Sister Carlotta exited the story line as well ... not sure if Card's going to go into that more in the next books or if that really was the end there.<br />There are a couple parts in the plot that seemed like Card had an idea but couldn't figure out a plausible way to carry it out.  The time when Bean, while shooting the breeze with a Battle School buddy, suddenly thinks that people are trying to kill him and they escape in the nick of time seemed a bit much.  A couple of the political moves seemed a little sketchy as well: Russia was intimidated by China's power but Japan wasn't?<br />It seems like I've given the book more criticism than praise, but the few complaints I have did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the book.  Bean's developing into quite an interesting character.  I was surprised to read in the afterward that there are two books following this one (I had assumed that Card would wrap everything up in just one more book).  I felt kind of like Card ran out of gas towards the end of the Ender trilogy ... here's hoping he can continue his success with the Bean series.ting character.

He can draw forth the whole spectrum of human emotion with his words. The majority of the \\"action\\" takes place in the first 400 pages, which are filled with humor, romance, and hope. The last part of the book is slower, but because the reader has gotten to know the boys as they were in their idealistic stages, the sadness that accompanies their later years is just as touching. Chabon's dialogue will leave you laughing out loud at times. He pulls no punches and takes no sides: instead of making broad statements about the persection of the Jews by the Nazis, or about homosexuality, he tells it from the human perspective.<br />I can see how some people can't get into this book. If you can't get into the characters or into the storyline, the last third of the book is going to be a drag. But if you take your time to enjoy the book, to enjoy the adventures of Joe and Sammy and appreciate the parallels between the real world and their created world, I think you will appreciate the beauty of these two guys' adventures.	2002-07-05

I feel the same way.  I'll give Card the extra .5 for the big risk he took by revisiting the classic story of Ender's Game.  Fortunately, his gamble payed off (is it really a gamble coming from the same guy who wrote Ender's Game though?).  Not only could Card make a book about a supporting charater from Ender's Game, but he managed to make it over a hundred pages longer than the original!<br />Even having read Ender's Game and knowing how the story will turn out, Ender's Shadow was still a surprisingly intense book.  Unlike Ender, Bean seems to have all the answers, and often seems to know more than even his teachers.  Bean is in a position to use the system instead of being used by it, unlike Ender, who as we know, is slowly being worn down by it.  Despite this position, Bean is often unsure of himself and has to live up to the comparisons to Ender (made by both Bean's peers and teachers, but also presumably the reader!)  On top of all this, Bean lives without knowing who his family is, and more importantly, the death sentence that comes with his enhanced intelligence.  In spite of this, Bean turns into a fine soldier and a fine kid.  I was most moved when he had the chance to take over the final battle when Ender appears to have frozen up, but instead trusts Ender to get the job done instead of taking the power for himself.<br />Card wisely put Bean in a position where he was extremely well-informed, enabling Card to add to the story instead of just rehashing it.  Ender's Shadow is not just Ender's Game from another point of view, but a story unto itself.  Unfortunately for Card, when it came to interactions between Ender and Bean, he was limited by the original story.  As a result, Ender plays as much of a supporting role in this book as Bean did in the original.<br />Most importantly, Ender's Shadow manages to recapture the emotions and imagination of the reader, just like Ender's Game.  My biggest knock on the trilogy that Card wrote between Ender's Game and Shadow is that he told a fine story but his characters seemed to be simply vehicles for the ideas he was trying to get across.  With Ender's Shadow Card gets back to what I feel he does best: portraying humanity through the story of a young, tragic kid like Ender, and now Bean.ame.

For me at least, the most notable part of this book was the skill with which Murakami dipped into his bucket of Loneliness and painted the tales of several unique individuals who could not be satisfied.  K, a loner who is distant from his family, loses the one person he truly loves (who cannot love him back the same way he loves her anyway).  Sumire, whose tornado-like love cannot be returned by Miu because of Miu's strange experience in Switzerland.  Miu, who suffered a truly bizarre experience on a Ferris Wheel and is only a shell of her previous self (Murakami's one of the few writers who can make a ferris wheel, of all things, terrifying).  K's married &quot;girlfriend&quot; and her son are also lonely.<br />Murakami somehow manages to keep this tale sad without being depressing.  A good work, it'll be appreciated by fans of Murakami.  However, if you haven't read anything by him and are looking for someplace to start, I'd recommend one of his earlier works first.  Murakami seems to have turned a little more mellow with his last few books.  Nevertheless, a good read.	2002-06-29

I had heard about all of the hype this book received in Japan, so I was curious to see what it would be like when I actually read it.<br />I was definitely not disappointed.  At its core, Miyabe's tale has a very real lesson about the dangers of credit card debt.  But what makes the story a real gem is the way that Miyabe tells the story of Shinjo Kyoko and the way she manipulates the way that Honma (and thus the reader) looks at her: as a mysterious petty criminal, a heinous murderer, a dreamer, a star-crossed victim; shallow, desperate, superstitious, heartless, ugly, and beautiful.  The ending (it would be hard to call it a \\"resolution\\") was fitting: there is no end to this tale yet, as Kyoko is still fleeing, even after being found.  Still, it's frustrating not to know what they all talked about in the restaurant at the end.  Miyabe leaves it up to the imagination: What would Tamotsu say to the person who killed his childhood friend?  What does Kimura Kozue say to the woman that came to kill her in cold-blood?  As Honma says, perhaps the best thing would be to just listen to the story that Kyoko has lived but has yet to tell to another.  But that's easy for him to say: unlike the others who had the misfortune to run across Kyoko, Honma did not have to pay in blood or heartbreak.<br />I did not read the English translation, but I hope the translator was able to capture the subtlety and fluidity of Miyabe's prose.  I'd be interested to know how the accents and dialects were translated into English.<br />This book was a beauty ... I hope more of her work is translated soon so a wider audience can enjoy her books!  A must-read.	2002-06-27

Ender's Game was brilliant ... Children of the Mind was just dull, melodramatic, and overextended. Ender himself all but disappeared in this last book, even before literally crumbling to dust 2/3 of the way through the book. I couldn't really buy into all of this one-Ender/three-bodies business, and the love interests of all the main characters seemed awfully forced. The \\"looming\\" Lusitania Fleet seemed like an afterthought as the characters launched into long winded philosophies on aiua and dealing with the three Enders.  It's almost like Card tried to make a large scale, Dune-type epic out of this series but changed course with this last book.  The idea of aiua connecting us all together was interesting (very reminiscent of neo-Confucian ideas about the structure of the universe), but it just wasn't enough to carry the book.<br />I think Card's biggest mistake with the whole series was aging Ender so quickly and reducing his role to meaningless cameo appearances. The tragic young Ender of Ender's Game--the Ender that won our hearts and imaginations--and the middle-aged Ender of the later books were like complete strangers. Maybe if the books had developed around Ender's growth as a person and Card had allowed Ender himself a more active role the conclusion would've been more satisfying. But sadly, by the end of the book, I just couldn't bring myself to care anymore. Ender was dead, the characters were all dull and the wild plotlines just seemed to spiral out of control.  I believe that development of characters and the depth of a book's environment/setting is absolutely crucial and the difference between great science fiction and average material.  Children of the Mind really is not that bad of a book.  But coming from Card, knowing he can do better ... it was a disappointment.<br />The good news is that after this book, the Ender's series returns back to its roots, back to the time when Ender was in Battle School.  While the next books in the series might not be as \\"deep\\" as this one, they are much more emotionally engaging.

Yongsu's Mother clearly enjoys telling her stories, and has developed a flair for the dramatic (at the expense of accuracy from time to time it appears).  I read this book for a class on East Asian folklore, and while I realize Yongsu's Mother is not the archetypal shaman, her experiences shed light on not only Korean shamans, but Koreans in general.<br />The most interesting part of the book, besides the stories, is Kendall's struggle to ascertain the accuracy of Yongsu's Mother's stories.  Yongsu's Mother is presumably not deliberately lying to Kendall, but instead exhibiting a fundamental human paradox: the past, presumably done with and set in stone, is made fluid by the human mind and memory.  The point is not that Yongsu's Mother's variations destroy her credibility, but rather that the variations give insight into her, and presumably her culture's, psyche.<br />This was a wonderful book ... don't be scared off by the title: this is not a book specifically about religion, but a biography about a woman who happens to be a shaman.  5 out of 5 stars.	2002-06-06

Unfortunately, I think the somewhat quaint words &quot;folk&quot; and &quot;lore&quot; in &quot;folklore&quot; throw people off and make them dimiss folklore studies as a trivial or insignificant field of scholarship.  &quot;Folklore&quot; just doesn't have the imposing sound of similar fields like anthropology and sociology.  Admittedly, before reading Toelken's book, if I thought of the word &quot;folk lore&quot; I probably would have pictured my grandfather sitting in a rocking chair telling stories from his childhood.  Of course, that is also a part of folklore, but I realize now how much more there is to it. Before reading this book, I didn't have a good understanding of what folklore was.  Even now, folklore's not so easy to define.  I think the best description of folklore is this: it is what makes our cultures unique, and what makes belonging to whatever social groups we belong to, significant.<br />Jokes, food, songs, religion ... Toelken covers these topics and more in his book, which reads kind of like an introduction to folklore studies.  Until I read this book, I probably would've laughed at the suggestion that I myself belong to several folk groups.  Now that I better understand the complex social groups that we all belong to, it's left me more curious to discover what makes different folk groups unique.  This is not the type of book that you read and think &quot;ok, that was nice&quot; and then never think about it again.  This book will open your eyes and make you question the things that you take for granted in everyday life.<br />A must-read!	2002-06-06

Put into a cage (or a deep hole in the sand) the primary, animal instinct is to escape, and to escape at all costs.  Before escaping the first time, Jumpei practically rapes the Woman, then forces her to drink sake and swallow pills.  This behavior is worse than the \\"illegal detainment\\" that he himself is experiencing.  But it's just a means to an end, he explains to himself.  After his near escape, he tries to force the Woman to have sex with him where everyone can see, just to \\"negotiate\\" to leave his hole for short breaks.  The Woman, who has lived in this hole for countless years, should be the more barbaric of the two, but instead, it's Jumpei.  You can almost sympathize with her apathy towards outsiders who might get hurt by their village's sand-selling operations.<br />Forced to re-evaluate his stance, Jumpei realizes that the Woman, far from being his captor, is a victim like him.  Furthermore, he comes to realize that there really isn't much to escape back to even if he does leave the village.  This becomes clear before and during his escape as he thinks contemptiously of his dead-end career, his colleage \\"Mobius Man,\\" and his wife, who he refers to in the Japanese version only as \\"aitsu\\"- \\"that damn woman\\".<br />As contradictory and cruel as Jumpei's actions may be, I couldn't help but wonder if I wouldn't do the same things in his situation.  Down in the pit, Jumpei is reduced to little more than an animal in a cage.  Abe describes the smells, emotions, and sights with a vivid honesty and realness.  At the end of the novel, Jumpei has not resigned himself to his fate, at least not consciously.  He'll think about escaping tomorrow he says.  The missing persons documents suggest that he never does try to escape.  But can you blame him?  His lack of freedom in the outside world is more subtle, but is it any less present than the lack of freedom in the hole?  Is his life with his wife any happier than his life with the Woman?  Is his job as a teacher more fulfilling than his job shovelling sand?  All answers appear to be a resounding \\"No.\\"  If so, other than pure animal instinct and \\"principle\\", what reason does he have to escape?filling than his job shovelling sand?

Murakami at his best	I was going on a road trip and needed something to read ... other than Sputnik Sweetheart, I'd already read all of Murakami's work, so I thought I'd give The Elephant Vanishes a shot.  Am I ever glad I did!<br />Murakami shows off his trademark humor, wit, and versatility while spinning tales about his favorite topic: humanity.  That's the best explanation I can give to someone who wants to know what kind of writer Murakami is: he writes about what it means to be alive.  Love, death, life, Murakami deals with the whole spectrum of human existance with amazing skill and grace.<br />Listing my favorite stories in this work without listing the entire table of contents would be a challenge, but I think it would be fair to say that my favorites were \\"The Silence,\\" \\"The Wind-up Bird\\" (from a longer Murakami novel), \\"The 100% Perfect Girl,\\" and \\"The Kangaroo Communique.\\"  If you haven't read Murakami before, this would be a great book to get your feet wet with.  If you're a Murakami fan but haven't read this one yet, what are you waiting for?  \\"The Elephant Vanishes\\" is Murakami at his best.	2002-05-29

Unlike a real, \\"empty\\" cat's cradle, this book was filled with irony, wit, and hard truths about society that ring true even (especially?) today.  If Cat's Cradle wasn't so damn funny, it would be chilling ... his end-of-the-world scenerio is devastatingly simple enough to be real.  Amidst this tale of impending doom, Vonnegut makes the reader think about religion, politics, and science with an increasingly cynical outlook.<br />This is an amazing book and a fast read.

I read the introduction after finishing the book (introductions always seem to ruin a surprise or two in the book if you read them first) ... so I was surprised to find out that Speaker for the Dead was actually Card's original &quot;main&quot; story.  Surprised, only because of how wonderful Ender's Game was ... it's hard to think of it as a prequel.<br />Speaker for the Dead was much broader in scope than Ender's Game, and appealed to the mind whereas Ender's Game appealed to the heart.  Religion on faroff planets, &quot;raman&quot; versus &quot;varelse&quot;, Speakers for the Dead ... what it came down to is that nothing is more powerful, or more comforting, than the Truth.  An idea that applies as much to Ender's world as it does to our own.<br />My only complaint, and probably the only thing that kept me from giving Speaker for the Dead 5 stars, is that I felt like Card introduced so many characters that they all seemed a little static and stereotyped.  The young Ender we laughed and cried with in Ender's Game seemed oddly stiff in SFTD (maybe living 3000 years will do that to you) ... many of the characters seemed to be filling &quot;roles&quot; (Pipo, Libo, and Miro as martyrs, Bishop Peregrino as &quot;The Church&quot;, Ouanda, Ela, and Novinha as victims of fate who need to be &quot;saved&quot; by Ender) ... I wish Card had slowed down just a bit and fleshed out the interesting characters he created.  What made Ender's Game the great read that it is was the emotion the reader feels for young, tragic Ender.  I couldn't help but feel that a little of that emotional attachment was missing from SFTD, which was a little disappointing, as the plot was so absorbing.<br />In spite of that small complaint, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I look forward to continuing on and reading Xenocide.	2002-03-20

I think the first chapter is quite possibly one of the most beautiful passages I've ever read. Continuing along, other works popped into mind ... Kawabata's Snow Country for one, along with Murakami's own Norwegian Wood and Dance, Dance, Dance. Perhaps more so than the books I just mentioned, South of the Border captures the subtle delicacy that is human existance. The pure beauty of slightly parted lips, the danger of one tug on the steering wheel at 80 mph, the unexplanable mystery represented by the envelope with money ... Murakami captured emotions and put them on paper with stunning results.<br />With the exception of Norwegian Wood, this is probably the most \\"normal\\" of Murakami's books. Both books deal with relatively similar topics, but to me at least, the growth of Murakami as a writer shows immensely in the differences between the two books. I read South of the Border right after reading Kawabata's Nobel-prize winning Snow Country (a similarly deceptively simple story) and I couldn't help but wonder if a Nobel prize isn't in Murakami's future as well. South of the Border, West of the Sun may not be Murakami's masterpiece ... some would say The Wind-up Bird Chronicle is, I personally like Dance, Dance, Dance the best ... but I feel that this book is nevertheless truly vintage Murakami. Murakami challenges the reader to rethink everything that he or she holds on to as \\"true\\" in this world. Shimamoto states that \\"some kinds of things, once they go forward, can never go back to where they began.\\" These things include not only physical acts, but the unfathomable workings of the mind and memory as well.	2002-03-11

That's the end?!?&quot;  But when I thought about it, the beauty of the ending matches the beauty of Snow Country, where what is left unsaid is often just as important as what is said.  To wrap up Snow Country with a more concrete, definite resolution would be an injustice in my opinion.<br />Kawabata's aptitude for description is amazing.  I could picture Yoko's reflection on Shimamura's train window, Komako's flushed cheeks, even Yoko's sadly beautiful voice with perfect clarity.  The storyline is no less beautiful.  Thinking of Komako and Yoko being left behind in that harsh but beautiful land, surrounded by nothing but the mountains, snow, and their complex pasts, and Shimamura returning to his spoiled idleness in Tokyo, is enough to sadden anyone.  I wonder if Shimamura will ever look back at his time in the Snow Country and regret what he has lost.<br />The only bad thing about Snow Country is that the English translation is not very good, although a good effort was made.  Unlike earlier Japanese novelists like Natsume Souseki, whose writing was heavily influenced by the West, Kawabata uses the full range of wordsmanship possible in his native Japanese language.  I would highly recommend the original Japanese version to anyone who has the time/ability to read it (it's &quot;Yukiguni&quot; in Japanese).  Snow Country is truly a modern masterpiece, a deserving recipient of the praise it has been given.	2002-02-28

Card managed to suspend any disbelief on my part that kids Ender's age could carry out such courageous and calculated acts by reminding us that Ender really was human, and a child at that.  Ender just wanted friends, people he could trust, rely on, and love.  Instead, his personal well-being (and sanity!) was sacrificed for the military objectives of human kind.  It's a tragedy that a big-hearted kid like Ender is turned into a killing machine, but it's a joy to read his triumphs and finally his ability to start a somewhat normal life in the end.<br />Kids saving the human race, kids ruling the planet ... as fantastic as it may seem, and is, it made for a compelling story.

US	50184447	R2AZMP0JSN65ZQ	0375704027	339664983	Norwegian Wood	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Murakami Lite	Having read most of Murakami's other works before reading Norwegian Wood, I was pretty surprised to read a fairly simple, realistic romance.  Although Murakami denies that this is autobiographical, one can't help but think that he based it somewhat on his own experiences.  Despite the different mood of the book, I believe that it would be a mistake to consider this book unrelated to his other works, as character traits of Watanabe, Midori, and Co. are found in many of Murakami's other works.  Midori's spunk and directness in particular can be glimpsed in a lot of Murakami's later characters.<br />As for the book itself ... although Norwegian Wood is supposedly a love story, I had a hard time seeing tender or romantic qualities in our protagonist.  Like many of Murakami's characters, Watanabe is at heart a realist, and a bit more selfish than the average Murakami \\"Everyman\\".  He has sex with pretty much every woman in the story so I had a hard time buying into his \\"love\\" for Naoko (he seemed more focused on her sexual prowess than her mind anyway).  I couldn't disagree with Nagasawa's drunken observation that Watanabe was like him in that he was incapable of truly loving anyone. Even when he declares that he can't do without Midori and never wants to be without her again, he goes and leaves her for a month after Naoko kills herself.  He even sleeps with Naoko's middle-aged roommate, Reiko.  Watanabe's ideals went out the window once he had a chance to take his pants off. When Naoko died, I found myself wondering if his sadness was because she died or because he lost a sexual outlet.  I couldn't help but feel that Naoko's gentle beauty was lost on him.  The older, wiser Watanabe that we start the book with seems to think along the same lines, but unfortunately, we lose his insight just a few pages into the book.<br />Norwegian Wood was an interesting read and likeable book, but not really the great literature Murakami's capable of.  Norwegian Wood was written around the same time as Banana Yoshimoto's \\"Kitchen\\" and I think it would be fair to make comparisons between the two.  That's not meant to be a knock on either story.  Murakami himself said he wanted to do something different in writing this book, which he certainly did.

The pace was fast and the two connected story lines sped rapidly towards their joint conclusion. The protagonist in the HB Wonderland and again in the End of the World start off not questioning much, rolling with the punches, but end up looking for more, asking questions, and seeking answers and solutions for their issues: in HB Wonderland, the shortage of time; in the End of the World, too much of it.<br /><br />I couldn't help but be a little disappointed with the ending though. I felt that Murakami set the reader up for a climax that just never came. The Wonderland protagonist put his affairs in order and then quietly awaited his mental switch-over. The End of the World version of the protagonist was left with unanswered questions. Why didn't he go with his shadow into the real world (and what happened to his shadow)? Is the reader to assume that the protagonist and the Librarian are going to live in exile off in the Woods? What happens when he tires of this? What's Murakami trying to say by having his protagonist choose to stay in the sterile, perfect Utopia instead of going out and re-discovering life in the real world?<br /><br />Murakami's questions about the meaning and substance of life, and our priorities in it were fascinating and thought-provoking. But I think this book falls just short of Murakami's later \\"Dance, Dance, Dance\\" in probing and commenting on contemporary life. Nevertheless, an enjoyable read.	2002-01-22

If Banana had developed it into a longer work a la Kitchen, it might've been as good of a read.<br />But in the end I just couldn't believe how bad the book was.  Kitchen was a light but thoughtful and thought-provoking romance full of emotion and beauty.  It was like a literary breath of fresh air.  Asleep was like Yoshimoto waxing poetic about a breath of fresh air.  Every sentence was truly beautiful and artfully constructed.  But without a solid story, it was mind-numbingly dull and felt meaningless.<br />Because I liked Kitchen so much, I'll give Yoshimoto another shot.

So, of course I had to read it.<br />I neither loved it nor hated it.  Holden Caulfield was a memorable character, one that I would love to sit down and talk with, but a character does not make a great book.  Salinger created a wonderful character, a cynical yet compassionate, tough yet insecure teenage boy, an outsider in a &quot;phony&quot; world.<br />But then nothing happens.  We see a portrait of a kid full of angst, a character that most of us can relate with to some degree or another ... and Salinger just has him spout cynisms when he's not suddenly crying because he feels lonely.  He hatches crazy schemes about running away and then abandons them when he realizes that his kid sister needs him, and he needs her.  So he hangs around, then eventually goes out to stay with his older brother, who (were he not his brother) would probably be termed a phony by Holden.  And that's it.  He runs back to family when confronted with a lifetime of loneliness.  A realistic resolution, perhaps, but not really the stuff classics are made of.<br />At no time does Holden ever feel despair or hopelessness.  And why should he?  Despite the situations he is in, he's always in control and active.  While he's not loaded, he's got plenty of money.  He's got friends, even if most of them are border-line phonies.  He's got a family who loves him.  So why on earth does he feel lonely?<br />Great characterization wasted by a mediocre book.	2002-01-02

Murakami did a wonderful job again of creating memorable characters (May Kasahara in particular, but Creta Kano and the &quot;Akasakas&quot; were favorites of mine as well).  He told incredible tales: the story of Lieutenant Mamiya probably could've been a novel in itself.  Creta Kano's &quot;defilement&quot; was chilling, and her metamorphoses were equally stunning.  The Akasakas' tale was interesting too.<br />But Murakami just couldn't tie it all together.  Many times I found myself saying &quot;what on earth was THAT all about&quot; ... the story of Cinnamon as a boy, where he crawls into bed with himself, for example.  Or Okada experiencing different &quot;self&quot;s and different &quot;here&quot;s.  However, my main source of dissatisfaction was Toru Okada himself.  In the midst of all of these dynamic and active characters, Okada just sits around waiting for phone calls, loiters around Shinjuku, and sits in his retrofitted well.  Except for a few, noteworthy events which stand out- his battle with death his first trip into the well, his battle with the musician, and then his knife-bat fight in the mysterious hotel room- there is very little substance to Okada.  Those three events were, for me, easily the highlights of the Okada Storyline.  The image I had of May Kasahara standing at the top of the well asking Okada how it felt to die little by little sticks with me still.  But the majority of the time, Okada just went around doing what other people told him to do.  By the end, he wasn't even in charge of the clothes that he wore.  He &quot;searched&quot; for his wife by sitting in a well designed for him in a house bought for him by the Akasakas.  I felt absolutely no empathy towards Okada.  In this surreal, harsh world that Murakami has created, Okada seems too pliable and soft for the protagonist's role.  If people like Okada are supposed to defeat the Noboru Watayas of the world, we're all in deep trouble.<br />In the end, Okada is left where he started- waiting for his wife to return.  Reading the book, that's essentially how I felt: I had just gone through an amazing, convoluted experience just to end up right back where I was when I started &quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.&quot;ms too pliable and soft for the protagonist's role.

Glory, for example.  Ryuji dreams that his special destiny is out there on the high seas.  Noboru sees this as manly and idolizes Ryuji, to the scorn of his gang leader.  Ryuji ends up leaving the sea for family life with Noboru's mother, causing him to fall &quot;from grace with the sea.&quot;  But is it really manly to continue to sail out over the horizon in search for &quot;glory&quot; that is almost certain not to be there?  It seems like loneliness and stubbornness in the face of futility are what Noboru (Mishima?) considers virtuous.  As stoic as that may seem to be, it seems somewhat absurd in this day and age.  However, Mishima, with his Zen samurai background, probably would consider these as virtues, not anachronisms.<br />The relationship between Ryuji and Noboru's mother was awkward and unnatural, which may have been Mishima's point- that a sailor like Ryuji could never fit into a domestic society- but was unconvincing nevertheless.  The parts of this book written from Ryuji's point of view, as opposed to Noboru's, portrayed him as somewhat shallow (his liking for popular music sticks out in my mind) even before he becomes involved with Noboru's mother.  Perhaps Mishima characterizes him this way on purpose: perhaps Mishima, like the chief, feels that there is no such thing as a hero in this world.<br />The hypocracy of Noboru and his gang was obvious too, and interesting.  They believed in supreme intellect, but were convinced that their genitals were made for copulating with stars in the Milky Way.  They believed that they could gain power over existance- a futile effort, given their mortality.  They kill Ryuji for failing to continue his quest for glory, yet these boys seem to have no desire to start their own quest.<br />While I found myself disagreeing often with the views Mishima took, or at least that I interpreted him as taking, I thought this was a fine book, one I would highly recommend.  Mishima challenges the reader to think about ideas such as glory, objectivity, and existance long after he or she finishes the novel.  Mishima's tale was chilling, but whether you agree with his viewpoints or not, a very satisfying read.  The vantage point of the story rotates between Noboru, his mother, and Ryuji- make sure you note the fact that the three main characters often view the same events quite differently, and make false assumptions about what the others are thinking.  Interpreting Mishima's work in just one way would be a mistake in my opinion.

Needless to say, I was hooked right away. The books are fun, and remarkably complex for \\"children's stories.\\" As much as I liked the first movie, I've liked the books even more ... but I still can't wait to see the next movie made! I hope they do a little bit better with the characterizations this time (am I the only one who thought the movie-Malfoy and movie-Snape didn't seem anywhere near as evil as their book counterparts?)<br />As creative as the Potter series is, it boils down to old-fashioned good vs. evil battles.  Which is why I don't understand the cries that this book promotes witchcraft and the like (especially when the people who say this haven't read the book or seen the movie).  Harry Potter does not promote witchcraft any more than the Wizard of Oz or Cinderella does (and I don't think anyone would consider the Fairy Godmother a challenge to the Christian faith ... I sure don't).<br />The best thing about the Harry Potter series is that it has gotten kids (and adults!) of all ages into reading books.  I think it's wonderful that kids are sitting down (voluntarily!) to read books.  It's just a shame that well-intentioned adults are trying to take away the joy of reading from their kids.	2001-11-30

I've been using the Kanji Learner's Dictionary for almost three years now and have nothing but good things to say about it.  The best thing about this dictionary is its size.  All of the commonly used kanji and kanji compounds are included in a compact volume.  When you're reading a newspaper article and come across an unfamiliar kanji/compound, or when you're writing a letter (or homework, etc.) and you can visualize a character but can't quite remember how it's written, who wants to lug out some 100 pound (slight exaggeration) kanji dictionary when you can quickly leaf through this one?<br />Granted, once you get out of the beginning stages, you will need a more thorough dictionary.  But I have found myself going back to this one every single time, unless there's a character or compound that doesn't appear in it (but honestly, I would say that happens only 1-5% of the time).  It's that convenient.<br />If you are looking for your first kanji dictionary, definitely buy this one- you'll find yourself going back to it again and again.  If you only have a huge kanji dictionary, buy this one too- you'll love the size, and be surprised by the fact that this dictionary actually has the vast majority of kanji/compounds that you're looking for ...	2001-11-15

Mikage and Yuichi's struggles in the aftermath of shocking and devastating deaths was incredibly moving. Their need to create a brighter, happier life together in a death-filled world, to discover how to continue to live in a cruel and uncaring environment ... isn't that what we all are trying to do to some degree or another? Kitchen is a 4.5/5 star book in my opinion. If you liked Kitchen, I'd recommend Haruki Murakami ... especially &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot; which touches on some similar themes but deals with them in very different ways.<br />Moonlight Shadow was a little whimsical for my tastes. The characters deal with the same issues as Mikage and Yuichi, but with a science fiction touch. Yoshimoto seemed to be trying too hard to make her point about moving on after death, rather than developing a good short story. It was a disappointing follow-up to Kitchen.<br />This is the first book of Yoshimoto's that I've read ... thanks to Kitchen, I'll be sure it's not the last. But I can only hope that the rest of her work is as well-writen as Kitchen and not like Moonlight Shadow.<br />One last comment: I read the Japanese version first, and I think the translator did a good job of getting Yoshimoto's style into English. It felt like the ending of the translation was more abrubt than the Japanese version, but I'm not sure why. Not sure if I'm the only one who felt that way or not ... In any event, I would definitely recommend Kitchen- see for yourself if you like it and Yoshimoto's style.	2001-11-01

I felt completely in touch with the narrator and was drawn to Murakami's characters.  Yuki was my favorite, Gotanda and Ame were up there too.  There were so many memorable scenes.  It was almost a disappointment to finish the book, leaving those familiar people behind.<br />I liked how the Sheep Man made but a cameo appearance, leaving the narrator to figure everything out for himself for the most part.  That's how it works in real life afterall.  The mystery of Kiki was equally interesting.  Perhaps the most impressive part of the book was the interaction between the narrator and Yuki though.<br />I can't say enough good things about the book.  I was completely blown away by it and given a new perspective on life.  Read Wild Sheep Chase and then Dance Dance Dance- you won't regret it!	2001-10-12
US	50184447	R22TYR4GOBK2EX	0895267152	594682043	Kokoro	Books	5	17	21	N	N	Poetic tale with meaning for everyone	The depth of this novel amazed me ... I cannot imagine the torment that Sensei felt, keeping his secret to himself until the very end of his life.  Orphaned at a young age, betrayed by his uncle over money, betrayer of his best friend over love, cause of his friend's suicide ... I can only hope that the narrator got as much out of Sensei's story as I did.<br />The last part, Sensei's confession, was clearly at the heart of Soseki's novel.  I believe I read that actually, Sensei's Testament was the first part Soseki wrote originally (which would, to a degree, explain the &quot;unfinished&quot; abrupt ending).  Also, during the first two parts &quot;I&quot; refers several times to Sensei's death, which would make sense chronologically if the last part was actually the first part.<br />In any event, reading this book was a joy, even if it was a sad tale.  Soseki's prose was akin to poetry, something I think was lost a bit in the translation (which is nearly fifty years old now).  Even in the translation, however, I think the poetic power that Soseki writes with is apparent.  Kokoro is a classic for the ages.	2001-09-07

The explanations that went along with the core conversations and grammar notes were enlightening, if a little complicated (especially the grammar notes).  In addition, the markings provided to help out with pronunciation were very helpful.<br />Unfortunately, the good points are overwhelmed by the bad.<br />*Vocabulary- I found the amount of vocabulary learned in the series to be terribly lacking.  Learning vocabulary seemed to be way behind grammar structures in priority given by the authors.  Without a substantial vocabulary, however, learning all of those grammar structures is like putting the cart before the horse.<br />*Romaji- Romaji is used very rarely in Japan.  And when it is used, the system used is not the system that JSL teaches.  Sure, the JSL's system might be more linguistically accurate, but I for one can't bring myself to say (with a straight face) that the tallest mountain in Japan is Mt. &quot;Huzi&quot;.<br />*No self-checks- If you are trying to learn Japanese on your own, DO NOT USE THIS SERIES.  I highly recommend &quot;Japanese For Everyone,&quot; I used it before going to Japan and felt ahead of the game when I arrived in Japan for a year as an exchange student.  I've also heard good things about the Yokoso series.<br />*Lack of Writing Emphasis- I hate romaji.  Learning to read it is a nearly worthless skill.  Why JSL insists on using it is beyond me.  There are separate books (2 I believe) called &quot;Japanese the Written Language&quot; but those books are so lacking that they make the JSL series look good.  I used the JSL and JWL series in college after a year in Japan and found it alarming at how limited the reading and writing abilities of my classmates who had learned Japanese just through JSL and JWL was.  It goes without saying, literacy is a big part of fluency.<br />*It's boring- Learning a language should be fun.  Bridging cultural differances, expanding ones own intellectual abilities ... I can think of few things as stimulating and exciting.  Another reviewer compared JSL3 to a chemistry book, but quite frankly I'd rather read the Chemistry book.  There is no reason why the serious learner of Japanese should not enjoy what he or she is doing.  In fact, if you aren't having fun, you're probably wasting your time.<br />A final word: if you're reading this review, chances are you're interested in learning Japanese or are a student of Japanese like me.  I love the Japanese language.  No, it's not easy.  Yes, it is a never-ending challenge.  But you should be having a lot of fun while you're at it.  I simply cannot recommend JSL when there are so many better options out there.  Do not waste your time or money on this series.ectual abilities ...

Having read the stories of the victims, I was able to appreciate how emotional and traumatic the events of that day were, and the effect of the gas attack on their lives from that day.  I cannot imagine how horrific it must have been for the victims to see their everyday life crumble into chaos and death right before their eyes.<br />The two parts of the book fit together nicely I think, and I like how Murakami was more hands-on with his interviews in the second half of the book, with the Aum members.  The first part was interesting, especially the interviews of Shizuko Akashi and the relatives of Eiji Wada.  The stoicism shown by the Japanese on the subways should be admirable, but I found it more alarming than anything else.  Hindsight is 20/20, of course, but so many people realized early on that something wrong was going on, but so few people reacted.  Also alarming was the general inability of the authorities to handle the emergency situation.<br />I found the interviews of the Aum and ex-Aum members to be interesting as well.  Most of them were lonely and unsure of the big questions in life, and saw Aum as a solution.  I was amazed at how many intelligent and logical people were lured in by Asahara's promise of spiritual freedom, which proved too good to be true.<br />Underground was amazing because of Murakami's ability to get people to open up to him and he managed to keep each person's story short and sweet.  I hope that no tragedy like this ever occurs in Japan or elsewhere, but if it does, I'm sure that people will be quicker to act next time and more lives will be saved.	2001-07-11

I can't say I fully understand this book (in fact, I'd be pretty suspicious of anyone who said they did completely understand it!) but it was fully enjoyable.  The ending was certainly unexpected, it definitely left me wondering what would happen to the protagonist.<br />An ordinary man experiencing an extraordinary adventure ... his quest to find a mysterious sheep ... if I had to describe this book to someone who's never read it I wouldn't be able to do it without explaining the entire book!

This extraordinary story about the bond between Ludo and Sibylla was amazing to follow, from Ludo's intense upbringing by his mother to his departure into the real world in seach of a father, and finally his discovery of the unexpected last samurai.<br />DeWitt's writing style was unique, a true stream-of-consciousness narrative that let the reader enter the minds of Ludo and Sibylla.  Ludo's search for a father, while extremely unorthodox, was moving and heartwarming.  Despite the writing style and the wandering search for a father, I thought the pace of the story was just right, keeping the book interesting without being frenetic.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone ... don't be put off by the somewhat highbrow subject matter.  Ludo's story is about much more than academics.  I would, however, recommend seeing Kurosawa's movie before reading the book though- it will give you a better understanding of the search for the Last Samurai.	2001-03-14

The stories in this book were truely fascinating, and I like the compact size as well.  However, what disappointed me the most was the unusually large proportion of explanations that accompanied the text.  The actual stories made up barely 10% of this book.  Granted, the aim of the book is to be able to read it without needing a dictionary, but still a breakdown of each and every sentence seemed a little like overkill.<br />I would love to see another reader from the people at &quot;Power Japanese.&quot;  But hopefully one with more Japanese text in it.  The number of good Japanese readers is so small, I'd rather sacrifice some time looking up a word or phrase if it means having the opportunity to have more real Japanese to read.	2000-10-24

One of the enjoyable things about this book is that for the most part,  they're all things to do and places to go that one has never heard of.  I  bought this book about 3/4 of the way through my stay of one year in  Yokohama (just south of Tokyo), and I regret that I couldn't make more time  to do more of the things in this book.<br />If you're on a whirlwind tour of  Tokyo and/or Japan, you can leave this book at home.  But if you'll be in  Tokyo for even a week or more, I highly recommend trying the tea ceremony,  seeing some minka, meditation, going to a public bath, etc.  These are  activities many Japanese people don't know about or don't take the time to  do often.  Moreover, they're activities that very few tourists (read:  gaijin) do, so it is more of an enjoyable experience in my opinion.<br />Great  book for those who enjoy places off the beaten path ...	2000-08-30

Granted, I haven't read other  translations of the Analects, so my rating is for the book itself more than  as a comparison to other translations.<br /><br />The fact that Confucius lived  thousands of years ago is amazing to me ... the things he says apply to  people throughout the ages, and they're full of wisdom.  Having read the  book, I find myself trying to be a bit more of a Confucian gentleman than I  did before reading it.  Confucius' teachings about humanity and being a  gentleman span across the ages.<br /><br />I'm very glad I read this book.  The  only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is because I can't compare it to  other translations, and it seems a little improper to rate a translated  book without comparing it to other translations.  But I personally found  Leys' lines to be easily understandable and interesting, even if I have no  way of ascertaining their accuracy with the original text.<br /><br />**7/31/09 UPDATE** I was looking to buy a copy of the Analects for a friend when I came across my own review when trying to decide between versions ... which is a somewhat strange feeling!  I'm still not an \\"expert\\", but having read several more Chinese classics in the meantime, including a few versions of the Analects, I thought I would update this review.  I think the Leys translation is a very good introduction to the Analects for someone who is looking for a starting point in Confucian thought.  The translation is a little bit loose but flows well in English, the introduction gives a good amount of context without going overboard, and the notes are nicely situated at the end to prevent clutter.  This makes it a good version for the Confucius novice, a comment I mean in earnest and not a backhanded compliment.  That said, I have yet to find a translation that surpasses Waley's in its rigor and thoroughness; the copious notes and detailed introduction are excellent as well.  However, Waley is likely to be a little more difficult for the newcomer to Confucius and Confucianism ... so he might not be the best starting point.  As always, different translations work best for different people.  Read the first couple of pages of a few versions and you'll quickly have an idea of what suits you.  No matter which version you end up with, the Analects is a wonderful work, worthy of the praise it receives!the newcomer to Confucius and Confucianism ... so he might not be the best starting point.
