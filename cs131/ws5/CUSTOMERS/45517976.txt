As if novel writing were not challenging enough for me. An aquaintance recommended I read Wendell Wellmans A Writers Roadmap. Of course! Any journey into an unknown territory certainly requires the use of a good roadmap. <br />Not long into the second chapter did I realize that many of the techniques that I was learning from Mr. Wellman would apply to my fiction writing as well. A double bonus, if you will. How could I go wrong? I couldnt.<br />Mr. Wellman's journey begins with Screenwriting from the Trenches. Sounded kind of like boot camp to this military vet. Here Wendell warns us, when writing, that the middle section will kill us. I know this to be true in my daily dietary battle with my own waistline. So this applies to writing as well? <br />The journey continues. From Who is your Hero to Whos Your Enemy. Regarding heroes, very important people they are, Mr. Wellman tells us that Hollywood chooses to discuss screenplays in terms of three acts. Act one: hero makes bad decision. Act two: hero makes bad decision (at this point, two wrongs do not make a right), Act three: hero make a good decision. And that is the simple formula. <br />Thanks Wendell, for this informative and well written roadmap. Could this be an introduction to writing? How about another guide? Id buy a copy.

This book was a mixed bag for me because Vlad is an accomplished photo-journalist and an accomplished author. The photography is almost worth the price of the book alone.<br />His words are almost poetic and I appreciated that Vlad, a Russian, was able to translate this book into English so that I, an American, could share in his passion. Each photo in his book has a detailed description included with it. It is evident to me that he writes from the heart. <br />No young man or woman should have to experience the horrors of war, and from what I now understand from reading his accounts, this war was ugly. Wait until you learn the real reason why the USSR sent these fine Russian boys into battle. It will make your blood boil.<br />Vlad Tamarov is a hero in every sense of the word. I would enjoy reading another book by him, yet this time something a little more mild. Norm Harrs, author, Fruit of a Poisonous Tree.	2003-04-07

Doctors, lawyers, and military people who write books have always given us the most real and heartfelt glimps of their worlds. An insider's view point, so to speak. So it is with author Guy \\"Indy\\" Jones, former Air Force. <br />In \\"Comfortably Numb\\" (I've achieved this state on numbness on occasion. I was sitting in a dentist's chair, so I can relate, somewhat, to his characters) yet what a descriptive title for a book. We do what we have to do regardless of the danger it presents to our lives. <br />\\"Regadless of the danger\\" should be the creedo of every military soul. So it was for Air Force reqruits Drew Martin and Jamie Dupree. Through the eyes of Jamie and Drew author Jones shows us the world of two young heros. From training to real life and of death and ultimately heroism. <br />The setting is aboard a JOINT STARS aircraft. North Korea is about to invade South Korea. Or is it? Life and death decisions have to be made in the blink of an eye. Some will die. Some will live. When the dust settles and the smoke clears, all will carry the badge of \\"hero.\\"<br />Well done Mr. Jones.	2003-02-25

All of the superlatives have been exhausted. It's true what they all say. If the term \\"streetwise\\" applies to military thrillers, then let the term apply to Capt. Meadows' Sixth Fleet. He writes with authority. <br />I very much enjoyed the raging battle scenes toward the end of the story. There is absolutely nothing good or grand about war, but I will note that Capt. Meadows did a masterful job at creating some very dramatic and very real battle scenes. The Americans and Italians are fighting the Libyans, both at sea and in the air. <br />I look forward to reading the entire Sixth Fleet series. The good news is that Capt. Meadows has recently contracted to do four more books. Well-done David. Cheers, shipmate.	2002-09-30

Be it Psycho, or Vertigo, or Rear Window, or The Birds, each story kept me on the edge of my seat. Now comes author Larry Brooks. And while, Larry, is not yet in Mr Hitchcock's class, I found myself enjoying Darkness Bound in the same way I'd enjoyed my Hitchcock thrillers, two generations ago. <br />As a best-selling writer of thrillers and mystery, I do understand the amount of skill required and the amount of talent that it takes to bring a great story from manuscript to print. And for those reasons I admire Larry Brooks, and what he has created in his Darkness Bound. <br />Darkness Bound is the tale of a man, who is caught up in a game of murder. He lured there by a fatally beautiful psycho babe . Bad turns to worse, for the man, as the people he most trusts fall into his morass of lies and deception and then turn against him. <br />If you are looking for an excellent psychological murder mystery/thriller, go out and buy, Darkness Bound. Read it. This story is bound to lead you from the darkness of bad fiction and into the light of good plot. I look forward to his next book, Pressure Points. Good job Larry. Norm Harris	2001-12-30

To learn why the tough talkin' hard smokin' Private Dick, along with his blonde bombshell assistant, Miss Jenkins, take to the mean streets of the town they call 'the big sleazy', post World War II Seattle.<BR>Colbert has done a masterful job at bringing his late 1940's tale of mystery and suspense to life. With rich and accurate descriptions of post war Seattle and truly memorable characters Colbert's story slinks its way through the back rooms and the back alleys of Seattle's creepiest neighborhood known simply as, Rat City. As a Seattle native I had the pleasure of growing up in the part of Seattle that was known as &quot;Rat City&quot;. Curt had described the setting perfectly. For me, Rat City, was a trip back in time and an enjoyable read. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good gumshoe/detective story. Two gumshoes up to Curt Colbert.	2001-09-20

Both former Vietnam era vets now writing Navy genre books. Although, he is much more sucessfull at this than I. For this reason I have truely enjoyed every Jake Grafton novel that I have read. His descriptions of our Navy, of its people and of its machines are beyond reproach. In this story spy sub USS America, I thought of the USS Jimmy Carter,the real spy sub, goes missing. Usually when a sub goes missing I think of Sontag's Blind Man's Bluff. The thing blew-up, it sank, people died. Not so. Jake learns that a group of CIA operators &quot;spooks&quot; may have swiped the sub. Their target is the White House. (Good choice. If you're trying to hit the broadside of a barn a huge white house would be an easy target. Dont' you think?)The Tomahawk cruise missle is designed to fly through a one meter window and is about 90% accurate on target. With a range of 1,500 miles, a Tomahawk lauched from Cuba would hit its mark. So the shot on the White House was not all that tough. Coonts is a relentless storyteller. If you liked Cuba or Hong Kong you will love this book as well. As a side note. I read a review that said,&quot;...rivals Clancy for fiction-as-realism and Cussler for spirited action.&quot; I disagree. Stephen Coonts' writing and storytelling skills stands alone as one of the modern standards to which all genre writers should strive to achieve. Put this one on your must real list.	2001-08-26

I have heard many blonde jokes and many more lawyer jokes in my time, but this is the first blonde lawyer joke, and there needs to be one, that I have run across. Actually the book, as is the movie, is an on going joke. Extremely humorous and yet one of great premise. And there is even a wonderful moral to be had in all of this. Cousin Vinny meets Bridget Jones? This story offers us love lost and love gained. Revenge and reward. Wonderful characters and clever and smart dialogue. I believe the movie was adapted from Amanda's first novel and she did a great job with the book. Elle Wood, the story's Fashion Merchandising sorority girl seemingly airhead heroine, worms her way into Harvard Law School for no other reason but to win back the love of her life. See the movie, read the book, but don't leave Amanda Brown's Legally Blonde off of your summer things to do list. General George Washington was once quoted as saying, 'When we assumed the Soldier, we did not lay aside the Citizen.&quot; Elle would modify that statement to read, &quot;When we assumed the Blonde, we did not lay aside the Airhead.&quot; Actually that is a line from my next book but it seemed to fit here, so I used it, and you read it here first. Get ready to laugh because...here comes, Elle!	2001-08-12

Anytime someone can put a 64 page book together and then market it for [price] you just have to take a moment and applaud them. <br />Seriously. I purchased two. One for my high school grad son and one for his mother. Who I figured put as much effort into son's success in graduating as son did.<br />Did you notice? The book has two different covers. One version shows a little boy on a swing and the other a little blonde girl. This way son can open said grad gift, at his graduation party, without having to suffer the embarrasment of having to own a book with a little girl on the cover. (Hey, give me credit for even noticing this minor detail.) And I did too take note of several grad cards with little girls on the cover...except those little girls were about 12 years older. But that's cool. The kid's going to college next year. He needs to be exposed to these things. <br />This hit book is the hit song. Very inspirational. Very moving. Very well worth the money for value given and recieved. So I hope you dance right on into the book store [...] and buy multipul copies of I Hope You Dance.

As a new male fan of Maureen Dennis I must admit No Hiding Place is probably the greatest piece of romance literature I have ever read. Truth be known...I do not read romance literature. I write about war, and blood and guts, and other macho stuff. Privately I fancy myself as a sort of modern day John Wayne. <br />But I had just seen the motion picture version of Bridget Jones's Diary and had decided that since I had begun the weekend by getting in touch with my inner self that I should finish the weekend by reading a story of romance. <br />In the bookstore, the pink cover caught my eye. I mean the cover of this book is beautiful. I looked both ways, to be sure none of my male counterparts were watching, I snatched the book from the shelf, sped to the check out counter, and bought the pink book. &quot;Plain brown bag, please,&quot; I whispered, in a deep voice, to the clerk. I then hurried home with my prize.<br />After pouring myself a glass of wine and selecting a good cigar from my humidor, I lit a candle or two and drew my bath (bubble). I then settled in to read No Hiding Place.<br />By the time the wine glass was empty (two bottles later), the cigar had reduced to a ashes (twice), the candles had burned to their bases, and the bath water had long grown cold, I had finished reading the pink book.<br />The next morning my roommate asked me if I enjoyed the pink book. I mumbled, &quot;Uh huh,&quot; and went back to reading the sports section of the newspaper. <br />She said, &quot;I wanted to read your pink book but it was all wet.&quot;  <br />I again mumbled, &quot;I...ah...I dropped it. I dropped it in the water. Yeah, that's right. And it got all wet.&quot; <br />&quot;It was that good?&quot; she asked knowingly. <br />I lowered the paper, peered at her from over the top of my reading glasses, and gushed, &quot;It was the greatest piece of romance literature I have ever read.&quot;	2001-05-13

Anyone who has read my reviews, glanced at my listmania, or read my bio on my `about me' page, will know that my reading habits are as diverse as the weather in Seattle. I move from foggy courtroom dramas to cloudy detective stories to sunny action/thrillers like a battleship moves from port to port (forgive me, I'm a Naval fiction writer. I had to use a nautical metaphor). In Graham Hamer's Paperchase, I found a new port of call. Here's a book that doesn't fit the mold - a refreshing mixture of human emotions, tight suspense, credible plot, and believeable characters. And, like me, the plot keeps on moving.<br />I won't categorize this one. It doesn't work to the standard blueprint. If I said it was like le Carre I'd be wrong. If I said it was like Follet I'd be wrong. If I said it was like Steven King, or Patterson or Pullman, I'd be wrong. Why? Because Paperchase is like all of them. But then again - it's not! There's a unique freshness about Paperchase that defies definition because here's an author who's developed a style very much his own; one who seems to have broken out of the genre trap to create his own niche. Buy it and find out what I mean.	2001-05-10

Mr. Deutermann's story telling is like a fine wine, it seems to improve with age. I have totally enjoyed every Deutermann offering that I have read.<br />I was first introduced to author Deutermann when I read Sweepers, then I read Scorpion in the Sea, and finally Zero Option. I write in the military genre myself, primarily Navy, and noticed that while Mr. Deutermann has gotten away from writing about his roots, the Navy, that he is still not opposed to attacking the establishment. Our federal government, bless their hearts, are such an easy target, don't you think? <br />In Hunting Season, Deutermann returns to using a woman, Janet Carter, as one of his primary protagonists. Remember Karen from Sweepers?  Janet, a rookie Fed, reminded me of Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs. And, like Sweepers, he has introduced to us to yet another sweeper. This time he writes about a good sweeper. How could there be such a thing as a good sweeper I ask? The psychological profile of the beast spells psychopath. <br />Hunting Season is a thriller in every sense of the word; its plot is both quick in pace and quick in action. And with enough twists and turns to keep any thrill seeking reader happy. P. T. Deutermann has a winner again so go hunting for and find Hunting Season.	2001-05-05

I had purchased The Informant as a resource book for my next novel little knowing what an outstanding story lay within. I was quick to realize that the non-fiction book that I was reading read like a fiction thriller. Many times, as author Kurt Eichenwald vividly described the process of how the FBI groomed their informant, I realized that I was feeling both tense and anxious. I know that only a very powerful story could invoke those emotions in me.<br />Needless to say The Informant proved an excellent book for me to read. The bonus for me was that I got all of the information I needed to craft my next fiction novel, which will deal with an FBI and Navy sting operation and an informant.  <br />I might add that The Constant Gardener by John Le Carre, just released an on it's way to being a bestseller (see my review), deals with something similar to the  Archer Daniels Midland anti trust case. In Le Carre's book it is the pharmaceutical-government complex that are the bad guys.	2001-04-10

The Informant is a non-fiction account of how the FBI used an Archer Daniels Midland executive to gather information in the lysine antitrust case the government brought against the corporation. I was ready to read more and Le Carre's The Constant Gardener fit the bill. <br />Often, when I read fiction such as Le Carre's, I wonder how much of it was based on truth. By the time I had finished the book I was sure that the pharmaceutical-government complex was up to something in not only Africa but elsewhere as well. Powerful companies who are not opposed to killing the people who stand in their way seem very likely to me. The suspicion surrounding the death of Karen Silkwood a Kerr-Mckey employee or even my recent novel about the military-industrial complex and an organization of fictitious aerospace contractors comes to mind. <br />John Le Carre has done a marvelous job at describing in detail his characters and their surroundings. The setting of the story is Kenya. Carre's writing and descriptions reminded me of how Hemmingway wrote about Africa in The Snows of Kilimanjaro and Other Stories.<br />In John Le Carre's The Constant Gardener the plot moves fast and tense and his characters are well drawn. For me The Constant Gardner was an exciting book to read and one that I would recommend to any one who enjoys either a mystery or a thriller.	2001-04-05

When I think of husband/wife sleuths I recall Dashiell Hammett's Nick and Nora Charles (The Thin Man) and television's Hart's- Hart to Hart (Robert Wagner and Stephanie Powers), and Rock Hudson and Susan St. James (MacMillian and Wife). Now come J D Robb's Dallas and Roarke in Betrayal in Death. Forgive me for comparing Robb's wonderful book to three TV programs (The Thin Man later became a TV series) my point is we all seem to love the husband and wife teams.<br />Husband/wife tandems offer us something that no other duo can offer us. A rich back-story based on an intimate relationship. Robb gives us this simmering and growing charismatic relationship both in this and in her previous stories featuring these characters. <br />No need for me to repeat the premise of J D Robb's Betrayal in Death. Preceding reviewers have sufficiently covered that ground. For me the true story is in the relationship between Dallas and Roarke just as it was for Nick and Nora, Hart and Hart, and etc. Has your marriage been a little boring lately? Then escape into the exhilarating world of Dallas and Roarke and read Betrayal of Death.

For a lawyer an admission of guilt makes for a tough defense; for a story it makes a great plot. I enjoy legal thrillers, as long as the bulk of the story is told outside of the courtroom. <br />To me there is nothing more boring than courtroom action, or inaction as it were, and courtroom dialog. I was not disappointed when I read The Vendetta Defense. The courtroom scenes turned out to be very well written and entertaining.<br />Lisa Scottoline is great at characterization. Pigeon Tony, this guy is a character, reminded me so much of my father that part way through the story I had total empathized with him. The story is great, the writing is exceptional, the characters are wonderful, the dialog is crisp, and should Judy Carrier lose her case at least Lisa Scottoline comes away a big winner with her masterpiece The Vendetta Defense.

I guessed part way through the book what was going on but I liked the story just the same. Now I have read my second Dean Koontz offering and I have to admit I could not figure out what was going on. Part way into the story I knew there was going to be far too many characters for me to keep track of.  Yet I was curious about the obvious biblical references to the majority of the character's names. Seraphim? Have you ever met anyone named Seraphim?  I kept thinking this story has a parallel story somewhere in the Holy Bible. I didn't find it though.   As I finished the book I recall wondering what Dean Koontz was up to? I was looking for that parallel. I finally found one. In like a lion out like a lamb (the month of March). The story started strong and finished weak.<br />To me the story was like a sophisticated X-Men story where the mutant good guys battle the mutant bad guys (most of the characters have semi-superpowers). This was not a negative for me. I enjoy the escapades of the X-Men.<br />I was the one that had to read A Tale of Two Cities several times before I began to realize the symbolism of the story. I believe I will need to ponder From the Corner of His Eye for a time as well. Maybe I'm being too harsh? Actually I would have no problem recommending this book to anyone.  Dean Koontz is the master.	2001-03-22

I say new age because I started my legal/mystery reading with Erle Stanley Gardner (Perry Mason). Honestly, I like all three writers. I would not call Turow's Personal Injuries a legal thriller. The characters are too well developed for this to be a thriller and the pacing seems too slow. In Personal Injuries Turow has given his fans a superbly plotted and methodical yarn. A yarn told step by step much the say way a lawyer would plan and strategize for a case. <br />For me to enjoy a story I have to care about the stories characters. And while Turow has developed his characters very well I didn't give a flip about them. Maybe I wasn't supposed to care? We all have our own reading preferences so I would not take it \\"personal\\" if you disagreed with me when I say, I enjoyed Personal Injuries.	2001-03-21

After suffering through the escapades of our last president (...) and then having to endure another 40 some odd days of bent and dimpled chads I was ready for something other than a story about a President of the United States. Fortunate I came across a novel titled $oft Money. A wonderful story about, none other than, a sitting President refreshed my enthusiasm to read more stories about the sordid lives of our elected kings. I'd been given Brad Meltzer's book but had put it aside, for the aforementioned reasons. Needless to say I was apprehensive when I first waded into this story. I had read the reviews that ran the gamut from one star to five stars.<br />In a nutshell a young man, Michael, dates the somewhat wild and rebellious daughter of the President. The two people observe the strange behavior of a white house aid while they are on a date. Someone gets murdered and the daughter suddenly becomes unavailable to the young man. Michael becomes the suspect and he's left to prove his own innocence. <br />I enjoyed the premise of the story. And I found it refreshing that Meltzer chose to focus his story on a sibling of the great man rather than on the great man himself. Reviews show a range of bad to good for this offering from Brad Metzler. No one can agree. But then again what two people ever agree on anything, even on something as simple as say...a good cigar? My advice is to buy the book and make your own decision. For what it's worth I enjoyed the book.	2001-03-21

This may be the one time where I judged the book by its title rather than its cover. House of Sand and Fog is a book you will either love or hate. If you like characterization and dialog, this book's for you. It is slow moving at times, the characters actions, or reactions, occasionally seemed slow. Some of the characters seemed a bit dense at times, hence the reference to \\"Fog\\" in the title. But the story is sound. I don't know anything about author Dubus, I do know that he as a talent for drawing a reader right into his characters lives. If you are looking for a happy book House of Sand and Fog will not fit your bill. If you are looking for an over all good book then get House of Sand and Fog now!	2001-03-20
US	45517976	R3LF5KPK87VI9	0399147012	743933431	Edge of Danger	Books	4	2	2	N	N	On the Edge.	I look forward to reading a Jack Higgins novel. As a kid I read every Ian Fleming 007 book I could find. Granted Higgins is not Fleming and Sean Dillon is not James Bond-but I draw the parallel just the same because I like the action stories and Jack Higgins never disappoints when it comes to action. If you like the action/danger story, one that will most assuredly place you at the edge of your chair, at the edge of your bed, or at the edge of your toilet seat, depending on where you do your most serious reading, then Edge of Danger is the book for you. Jack Higgins is a far better writer than I so when I offer criticism I do it in my most humble way. So here it is, I get tired of plots involving the President of the United States.	2001-03-20

I understand he has written several westerns? Itshows. While I enjoyed Mr. Parker taking a potshot by writing Potshotin the back of my mind I kept wondering when his characters wouldcircle the wagons and if the cavalry would arrive on time. Don'tget me wrong I loved the book. And Mr. Parker seems to have coveredall of his bases. The beautiful damsel, the tough as nailsprotagonist, ....  You see, the Preacher and his banditos are holed upin the Dell, kind of like the hole-in-the-wall gang from the oldwest. The hero needs to root them out so he rounds up his posse, ... etc. He comes up with four of them; he falls twohombres short to suit me. I wanted seven, kind of like in the moviewestern The Magnificent Seven. If you have sound tracks from any ofthe Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns I'd recommend you play themsoftly in the background as you sip your branch water and enjoyPotshot	2001-03-19

The person who had recommended the book to me told me that the author had drawn characters into the story from his past books. I feared something akin to a bad high school class reunion. McCaleb and Bosch. Knowing that the author had written about two these guys in the past I worried about the back-story that I did not have. \\"You like fast paced mysteries,\\" my friend said. \\"I like Nelson DeMille,\\" was my reply. \\"I don't like class reunions. I don't like jumping into the middle of something.\\" So with some reluctance I read A Darkness More Than Night. The book was good. Good plot, good writing, good characterizations, killer ending, go buy it	2001-03-19

With this in mind I was curious how Mr. Patterson would fair when I purchased his book 1st to Die.  I'd hoped that Mr. Patterson's protagonist, policewoman, Lindsey Boxer, would not prove to be the prototypical tough-as-nails superfemale that seems to find her way into so much of our fiction today. How could a policewoman named Boxer not be? The thought of a man writing from the viewpoint of a macho policewoman left me somewhat apprehensive. Placing my apprehensions behind me I fastened my seatbelt, I'd grown accustomed to James Patterson's break neck writing pace. I was not disappointed. The verdict is in. 1st to Die is 1st rate. As to whether or not he was successful as cross writing, the jury is still out	2001-03-19
US	45517976	R1SLCLOMLCPVID	0525945938	359050157	Scarlet Feather	Books	5	3	3	N	N	What a way to bow out	I had heard that Scarlet Feather would be Maeve Binchy's &quot;swan song.&quot; I then saw the title, you know, with the feathers? Not so. The title comes from a combination of the two main character's names, Cathy Scarlet and Tom Feather. Cathy and Tom, friends not lovers, form a cartering business. A story about a cartering business...how delicious I thought. Again I was wrong. Like all Binchy novels Scarlet Feather is a saga with characters and villians--and a mystery to be solved. As a fiction author I read for more than to just entertain myself but to appreciate writing style and to learn. Over the years I have come to know that Ms. Binchy has a gift for characterization and dialog. Come on Maeve just one more book...please!	2001-03-18
US	45517976	R1QVWQMBRF7ZFR	038550120X	299088859	A Painted House	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Bravo!	Two thumbs up to you Mr. Grisham for successfully stepping out of your comfort zone (legal/thriller) and into a different genre. A Painted House is a story told from the viewpoint of a seven-year-old boy. Talk about going back in personal time to draw a character so young. When I think of coming-of-age stories I think of John Irvin's The Cider House Rules. Dickens, Irving, Grisham? I can see where the die-hard Grisham fan might be disappointed--this is not a legal thriller. It is a great story set in a time and place where things were slow and peaceful. The only problem I had with the story was in the name of the story's main character, Luke. I kept thinking of Little Luke from the old television program, The Real McCoy's. &quot;Luke! Luke! The barn's on fire! Other than that, this story was great and you should buy the book	2001-03-18

Author Eric Burton's story telling brought this reader 'up close and personal' with the people who are closest to one of the most powerful men on the planet; the spin doctors and the political hucksters bent on protecting the President's image and career, at all costs. Burton's fictional president, Preston Wesley, like some of his predecessors (JFK and Bill Clinton) has a skeleton or two in his closet, and the author did a great job of keeping this reader in suspense through to the end.	2001-01-28
