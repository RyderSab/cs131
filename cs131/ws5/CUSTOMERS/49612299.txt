I can highly recommend this book though for new to the craft as well as old.  Yes, it covers the usual, but at the same time it is new and refreshing.  However, it does cover more intense and topics that are usually not touched on in novice books (such as the Qabbalah)  I am pleased to have added this to my own library!	2004-03-24

Ms. Walton does an incredible job of taking Welsh Mythology and breathing life into it making it a novel of unsurpassed proportions.  You encounter hidden lessons that actually sent shivers through me.  This book by no means should replace the Mabinogion's translation by Lady Charlotte, which is a more literal translation.  However, Ms. Walton provides insight to the myths and is quite inspiring in doing so.  This book just might change your life in some ways.	2004-01-25

It had a great explanation for the different types of familiars in the front, meditation ideas, and a very comprehensive number of different animals that you might find are your spirit guides.  I have found many people including myself who are not too keen on certain types of critters and she covers those as well, with reassurance and advice. Rest assured it is a good book to add to your library.	2003-11-05

You can expect to find the following...<BR>Origin of Halloween and Lore, Rituals and Celebrations, Herbs and Omens, Symbols, Superstions, Halloween Divinations, Recipes, and a Pagan Perspective, and more.<br />  I find anything on Samhain delightful and interesting, a very nice additon to my Ravenwolf book.  <br />  I love her choice of covers, using a John Wm Waterhouse painting once again.

It is basically about her coming to grips with her past, while at the same time she is seeing a serial killer commit murders.  I found it very predictable that you are intentionally mislead (knowing darn well the author was not going to give you that kind of info. on the killer) believe it was one character.  I had no problem knowing who the killer would be after a character was abruptly removed from the story...only to be never heard from again???? yeah right.

It is a wonderful section that is a mini encyclodedia of different plants and herbs used for aromatherapy, which lists the parts of plant used, ruling planet, and magickal uses.  I do however, like any specific topic, think you should also read and refer to other sources if you are serious about persuing something.  However, this is an excellent choice for a start.	2002-03-13

The spellings of words are very different and they use different terms as well. Examples:  hereupon, heretofor, tryal, joyning, choaked, etc...This is just a warning, for those who may not like a whole book written in such away.<br />Personally it was a must for my Salem Library, but it is NOT for everybody.	2002-03-13

It does NOT make up a fantasy world you are sent to, but instead you are in current time and place for the novel.

Once again it is a big fat wordy book.  It is written from a strange point of view, like you are a bird, flying over a town observing things and going invisibly into open windows of houses.  It takes the first 75 pages to get use to this strange stand point.  I have no idea why they would choose to write this way because tryng to be \\"creative\\", actually becomes aggravating. <br />It is good and sick horror stemming once again from the Good versus Evil storyline from the Talisman.  Once again we have Travelin Jack as the main character and once again the two authors insist on killing off one of your favorite characters.<BR>The ending in the \\"Black House\\" once agains gets very very bizarre and certainly can not be predictable.

It is specifically a nice small book, with celtic mythology and referances and a very reaonable price.  It surely can be used as a referance for the Wiccan way of life, but there are many alternate paths that shall find this book interesting.  For a celetic flair in your life or for the curious, I do recomend this book.	2002-03-10
