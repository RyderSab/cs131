US	20947016	R7K85OACJWSFF	0684148013	600826917	The Blitzkrieg Story	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Hardly a "lightning" read	\\"The Blitzkrieg Story\\" was published in the United States in 1976, the same year that another title by Charles Messenger, \\"The Art of Blitzkrieg,\\" was published in the U.K. A revised edition of the latter title was published in Britain in 1991 and in the United States in 1994. I assume that \\"The Blitzkrieg Story\\" and \\"The Art of Blitzkrieg\\" are essentially the same book, and I've found no indication that the revised edition was substantially updated from the original, but don't hold me to that. Certainly, the actions of the Coalition armies the 1991 Gulf War would have warranted a re-assessment of the potential of air-supported armored warfare in the late 20th century.  If you have the opportunity to buy it, the revised edition might be a better value than the 1976 originals. <br /> <br />Messenger is (or was) an officer in the Royal Tank Regiment and has published numerous books on 20th-century warfare.  His professional experience and insight provide in \\"The Blitzkrieg Story\\" a thorough account of the the development of tank warfare from World War I through the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. For casual readers, however, I fear the book will be a rather arid reading experience.  Roughly the first half of the book is spent discussing the controversies within various armies (those of Great Britain, Germany, France, the U.S.S.R., and the United States, essentially) during the 1920s and 1930s over the proper employment of tanks (as \\"rolling pillboxes\\" supporting infantry vs. use in independent armored/mechanized formations striking quickly and deeply into enemy territory).  Messenger's account of these arguments is an important part of the story he tells, but not terribly exciting (if that's what you're seeking from this subject). <br /> <br />One would expect that things would pick up once Messenger's account arrives at September 1939 and the Wehrmacht begins its \\"lightning war\\" on Poland.  The author covers the major armored campaigns of the European war quite thoroughly; but, again, his \\"top-down,\\" command-oriented accounts are not scintillating reads.  Messenger's comparison of the Israeli Defense Forces' brand of armored/air warfare with the World War II practitioners of \\"blitzkrieg\\" is interesting and insightful. I also commend him on attending to the role of air power in the rise of mechanized warfare, something that other writers on tank battles often overlook. <br /> <br />Again, casual readers, or those seeking slam-bang action stories about tank warfare, are going to be disappointed in \\"The Blitzkrieg Story.\\"  This is a scholarly, rather technical account of the ways in which various armies developed and used the tank in the mid-20th century, and Messenger's rather detached writing style adds to the book's overall dryness.  I would recommend it as a managable, informative introduction to the topic; but the reader will need to pay close attention and commit himself to a hard slog through the dense military prose.	2005-09-20
US	20947016	R1EOKUARHEQT00	1403964335	229982078	Saudi Arabia Exposed: Inside a Kingdom in Crisis	Books	3	20	24	N	N	Valid impressions from one knowledgable journalist	The semi-lurid title of this book should not deter anyone from reading it -- nor should it convince any reader that he or she is getting all the lowdown on a country that everyone, it seems, has been bashing since Sept. 11, 2001.  Bradford's insights into Saudi Arabia seem valid, but they remain the impressions of just one man, however knowledgable.    The most important thing I learned from Bradford (and I hasten to say that I am no expert on Saudi Arabia) is that this nation is not some monolithic kingdom chock full of fanatical Muslims loyal to the Saud family. Bradford demonstrates that the Arabian peninsula (or that part of it ruled by the Saudis) is a diverse place; there are other families and ethnic groups whose allegiance to the Saud family is pragmatic at best and in some cases rather tenuous. It is this diversity that, in part, is responsible for the Saud family's repressiveness and sometimes violent supression of dissent.    Bradford also indicates that dissent, or the potential for dissent, is widespread among the Saudi tribe as well as other subjects. The Saud family seems to be caught between forces that would pull it toward an increasingly Westernized culture or toward an Islamic government even more repressive than the current regime.  Bradford portrays a kingdom that is desperately trying to find a way to accommodate the modern world without offending traditionalists -- a problem not unique to either Saudi Arabia or Islam.    For all the value of Bradford's insights (and he did have unusual access for a Westerner, even one proficient in Arabic), there is a sense that \\"Saudi Arabia Exposed\\" rehashes several older articles from The Arab News, for which Bradford worked in Jiddah.  Although what's here is well-organized, there is a sense of shallowness based on the fact that this book consists  largely of the observations of one writer -- again, however knowledgable.  First-person observations can be of great value, no doubt, but they not do necessarily make for a thorough assessment of any subject -- especially one as complex as Saudi Arabia is for most Western readers.    I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the subject, but this should not be the only book one reads about Saudi Arabia.  Like it or not, the United States and the non-Islamic world generally are going to need to continue an accommodation with the Saudis, gently encouraging the liberalizing forces in their culture and politics without raising the old spectres of colonialism and mindless religious antagonism. Bradford offers hope that liberalization can work in Saudi Arabia, but he also provides a bleak picture of the obstacles that the kingdom's Western-oriented reformers need to overcome.    Glaring omission:  Not a single map!  And a \\"cast of characters\\" would have been nice -- no offense, but it's difficult to pick out who's who among all the Faisals and Alis and Abdullahs in the Saud family, past and present.	2005-09-19
US	20947016	R1AH30KJD6FFY7	0897334434	300764736	The Five Weeks of Giuseppe Zangara: The Man Who Would Assassinate FDR	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Near definitive, for now	\\"Captain Hornblower\\" provides a review of this book with which I largely agree, so I'll not repeat his comments here -- save to say that the Captain is a bit too hard on the author's legalistic approach.    Blaise Picchi is an attorney, after all, and the degree of justice that Giuseppe Zangara received in that Miami courtroom in February and March of 1933 is a major part of his story.  If one accepts that our adversarial system of criminal justice demands that a lawyer fight tooth and nail for his/her client, it's understandable that Picchi would be appalled by the poor representation that Zangara received, when a more vigorous and imaginative defense might have won him a life sentence rather than the electric chair.    Of course, the case against Zangara was difficult to refute -- he shot six people (with five bullets!) in front of a crowd of at least several dozen witnesses, if not hundreds -- and certainly many who read this book will not wonder that he was convicted and executed so quickly for the murder of Chicago mayor Anton Cermak. The three court-appointed attorneys who represented Zangara, according to Picchi's account, seem to have been more concerned with guarding the integrity of the Dade County judicial system -- ensuring that the swift arraignments of and pleas by Zangara were not perceived by the public or the media as egregious miscarriages of justice --  than with saving their client's life.  If one believes in the righteousness of capital punishment, of course, then Zangara was doomed, and rightfully so, from the moment that Cermak drew his last breath.     Aside from the question of whether Zangara really received justice, the other major question in this bizarre tale is simply, Why? Why would Zangara have wanted to kill Franklin D. Roosevelt? Why did he show no real remorse over the other people he did shoot, including Cermak?  And, was Cermak -- an enemy of Chicago's Capone mob -- the real target after all?    Picchi makes a good case for Zangara's rather simplistic motivation for murder. Simply kill all the capitalists, presidents and kings, Zangara apparently advocated, until no one will want to hold those jobs, and then a just, equitable society will emerge.  Picchi shows that Zangara was neither crazy nor guileful, but simply a man quite willing to commit murder in furtherance of his twisted moral vision.  Picchi also sees in Zangara a death wish, a willingness to die for his beliefs brought on, perhaps, by a chronic bellyache that made his life increasingly hellish. If one accepts Picchi's portrait of a guileless Zangara, it's not difficult to accept the entries of Zangara's fascinating journal at face value.    Growing up near Miami, I first heard about the Zangara shooting as a child; but what really fired my interest in this incident was an episode on the old \\"The Untouchables\\" TV series, c.1960, in which Robert Stack foils the Capone mob's plans to kill Cermak in Miami, only to have the Mayor gunned down by the little Italian guy in the crowd. Picchi examines the often-cited hypothesis that Zangara actually was a mob hitman. He finds little evidence to support it and much to oppose it.    As the Captain so ably states, what lifts the Zangara shooting to a level of more than minor historical interest is the presence of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the implications for the United States, and the planet, had he been murdered that warm Florida night in February, 1933.  The consequences boggle the mind. Picchi has done a good job of examining the crime itself, and its consequences for Zangara. If the book is lacking, it's in failing to place the crime forcefully into that \\"what if\\" context. Of course, history still is about what happened, not what might have happened (leave that to Harry Turtledove and Newt Gingrich); and unless the missing official records emerge and yield something startling (not very likely, I'd wager), Picchi has given us the best account of this episode we're likely to see anytime soon.    (Nag, nag, nag: Chicago Academic Press needs to obtain a copy of the \\"Chicago Manual of Style\\" and a fresh copy editor. There are several amateurish typos here, plus some glaring factual errors -- e.g., Huey Long was nicknamed \\"The Kingfish,\\" NOT \\"Kingfisher.\\"  Any Randy Newman fan knows that! The book contains some excellent photos but also would have benefited from a diagram of the crime scene.)	2005-09-08
US	20947016	R2J4MPFKHV43XO	0805069569	566397493	Warren G. Harding: The American Presidents Series: The 29th President, 1921-1923	Books	3	22	24	N	N	Blowing off the dust ...	I decided to read this book after seeing Dean plug it on C-SPAN. It sounded fascinating, and it was.  As a history student and reader, I had never bothered to read up on Harding and had been subjected to the repeated, glib assessments of the 29th president as a bland mediocrity, a morally compromised Republican get-along, go-along who comfortably fell into the presidency and did little but play poker, drink bootleg liquor, and frolic with his mistress in the White House before dying of a bellyache. <br /> <br />Wrong, concludes Dean. I doubt that anyone will ever make the case for Harding being a great president, but Dean at least makes a case for his being a competent chief executive who racked up some worthwhile accomplishments during his twenty-nine months in office. Eschewing the myths that grew up around the man after his death in August, 1923, Dean evaluates the personal attacks that were made on Harding and finds them wanting in both veracity and objectivity. <br /> <br />Of course, Harding was tainted in life and in death by the shenanigans of two cabinet members and some of their cronies. I do wish Dean had gone deeper into the treatment that the U.S. news media gave to Teapot Dome and the other scandals that scarred Harding's administration, and whether his tarnished reputation can be traced to a few partisan journalists (such as H.L. Mencken, whom Dean does talk about at length). Although Dean portrays Harding (who was for many years a newspaper publisher) as getting along famously with White House reporters and the Republican-dominated news media of his day, there must have been something beyond politics that motivated Mencken and Harding's other detractors to constantly trash him.  Eastern elitism? Scorn for Harding's often tortured oratory? (He wasn't a bad writer, just ... different.) Contempt for his rather laid-back leadership style, which emphasized compromise rather than confrontation?  There's a subject for a book in itself, but not a book of this volume's limited scope. <br /> <br />Of course, Dean's own tarnished White House years (and their common Ohio background) have likely made him a sympathetic Harding biographer. And this book -- part of a series of short presidential bios -- was never intended as the last word on Harding or his presidency.  But for the general public, at least, Dean's account of Harding blows the dust off of history and reminds us that the past needs frequent re-examination and re-evaluation.  Harding may not be among America's great or near-great presidents, but Dean makes a strong case for considering him with respect and, perhaps, even some admiration. Of course, there are other Harding biographies of the post-1964 era (the crucial year in which Harding's presidential papers finally were made public) that are less admiring than Dean, and I'd like to read them as well. But Dean is a reasonable place to start.    <br /> <br />	2005-09-08

One of the best aspects of the book is that, while this is essentially a \\"warts and all\\" biography, the author doesn't try to create warts where none existed.  If the worst one can say of Gehrig was that he was a mama's boy, a cheapskate, and a corporation man lacking in both rebelliousness and \\"color,\\" than it's the worst one can say about millions of young Americans, especially the immigrants and sons of immigrants, of his generation. Eig realizes that the drama of Gehrig's life doesn't need to be invented or enhanced. If anything, he patiently understates the tragedy that Gehrig faced as his powerful physique was ravaged by an incurable disease, as a superb athlete helplessly watched his athleticism deteriorate and his career, then his life, destroyed.    As portrayed by Eig, there is something almost childish about the optimism with which Gehrig confronted his debilitation and death.  But it was not in Gehrig to be cynical, or to feel sorry for himself, at least not for long.  One wonders if he could have, or would have, made his \\"luckiest man\\" speech in the weeks before he died (he actually made his famous remarks almost two years before his death, when he genuinely believed he might beat ALS). Yet one finds in those glorious words the gratitude and generosity that Gehrig seems to have always felt for his family, his teammates, and the fans who gave him the opportunity to make a comfortable and enjoyable living playing a game he loved.    Eig has plumbed all the expected source materials, including the memories of many old ballplayers who knew Gehrig, and he's come up with new sources (correspondence between Gehrig and one of his principal physicians) that shed more light on the man.  He also does a fine job in capturing the complex relationships that Gehrig had with his mother, his wife, and his teammates (especially Babe Ruth)-- again, reporting the facts and neither romanticizing nor villainizing any of them.    In short, this is terrific book, both as an entertaining read and as as chronicle of a sports superstar from a more innocent age. Eig avoids comparisons of Gehrig to modern-day sports stars, but I will say that Gehrig's feats on the ball field, and his modest grace off the field, would be becoming to any ballplayer today.    P.S. -- I have to mention one error: Eig refers a couple of times to the former commissioner of baseball as Judge Kenesaw \\"Mountain\\" Landis, but the quotation marks are unnecessary. Landis's given name was taken from an 1864 Civil War battle in Georgia, at Kennesaw Mountain.	2005-08-23
US	20947016	R44LNGZBUYLCJ	0806511214	50019722	The West That Never Was	Books	3	6	6	N	N	More entertaining than scholarly	Those seeking a thorough overview of the history of the American western film will likely be disappointed in this nonetheless quite readable book. This collection of short reviews would better be titled \\"Tony Thomas's Favorite Western Stars.\\" <br /> <br />Entertainment journalist Thomas was a prolific creator of books cataloging films by various motion picture performers or dealing with various film themes, but -- at least judging by \\"The West That Never Was\\" -- he was mainly a well-informed professional fan and seemed neither interested nor capable of plumbing the more profound meaning of motion pictures to our culture.  I'm not fond of the over-intellectualized, jargon-laden mud that passes for academic film criticism today; but a book that presents itself as a history of a genre ought to have more context and thought than this book presents. <br /> <br />What we get, essentially, is a series of short pieces about western films that Thomas enjoyed as a kid and as an adult, and their stars (many of whom journalist Thomas sought out and interviewed). His list starts with a number of \\"B\\" westerns of the 1930s, followed by several selections from the '40s through the early '70s, when the American western film matured and then declined. Essentially, he has chosen one or two films to represent each of his favorite western stars of the era -- so, for example, while he features the 1955 classic \\"The Man From Laramie,\\" one of a string of early '50s westerns directed by Anthony Mann and starring James Stewart, he describes their other, arguably more significant collaborations -- \\"Winchester '73\\" and \\"The Naked Spur,\\" among them -- only in passing. There are frequent mentions of John Wayne, but no feature reviews of \\"Stagecoach,\\" \\"Red River,\\"The Searchers,\\" \\"Rio Bravo,\\" \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,\\" \\"True Grit,\\" or any of Wayne's later westerns save his last, \\"The Shootist.\\"  John Ford's contribution to the American western cinema is represented only by \\"My Darling Clementine\\" and \\"Fort Apache\\" -- two good selections, but hardly indicative of Ford's influence. <br /> <br />Thomas's concentration on his own movie-going experiences and hero-worship also leaves out large chunks of western film history. None of his featured films are silents, and he has little to say about the few but significant \\"A\\" westerns of the 1930s and early '40s (\\"Cimarron,\\" \\"Law and Order,\\" \\"The Plainsman,\\" \\"The Westerner,\\" \\"The Dark Command,\\" \\"They Died with Their Boots On,\\" \\"The Outlaw,\\" etc.). Similarly, his interest in \\"B\\" westerns seems to have ended about 1940, and there's precious little about Roy Rogers, Lash LaRue, or the fulltime movie cowboys whose careers flourished and the then faded in the twilight of the programmers. <br /> <br />There are some strong points to this book, however. I appreciate that Thomas usually tried to tie all the films he reviewed to a particular era of American history, even if the connection is only Hollywood-superficial.  And there are plenty of well-reproduced B&W photographs in each review. <br /> <br />All in all, this is one informed fan's paean to his movie-going past and some of the western films and stars he admired.  Those who've never read up on this aspect of American cinema history might find it a painless introduction (and of course, most of the movies covered, including many of the \\"Bs,\\" are readily available on video). Someone looking for a more comprehensive history of the American western -- and more insight into the genre's significance in our culture -- is advised to go elsewhere.	2005-08-15
US	20947016	RPAFE9BA880YL	0060558288	261484893	God's Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn't Get It	Books	3	19	25	N	N	"Christian" and "Republican" are not synonymous	When it comes to a controversial book like \\"God's Politics,\\" one is tempted to review the other Amazon reviewers and their passionate paeans and denunciations, rather than evaluate the book itself.  No offense to Rodney King, but can I say one thing?  Can't we all just get along?  Seriously.  We need to get past the political and media labels that divide the United States and start recognizing our common humanity again.  (Of course, I'm assuming you see divisiveness as a bad thing.  Perhaps you don't.  More on that below.) <br /> <br />Nutshell:  Supporters of the current Republican leadership, including President George W. Bush, will find Wallis irritating -- but perhaps thought-provoking.  Those who continue to oppose Bush, including lifelong Democrats like myself, will find themselves largely in agreement with Wallis, even if they are not Christians.  Perhaps it's obvious to all but the news media, but \\"Christian\\" and \\"Republican\\" are not synonymous; Wallis reminds us that Democrats can be Christians too, and that there is great diversity and, yes, division among American Christians about the direction their country is taking under the current administration and Congress. <br /> <br />There's diversity within the Democratic Party as well (and among Republicans, many of whom are growing increasingly disenchanted with the Bush-Rove administration.). Disclaimer: Religiously, I approached \\"God's Politics\\" as a long-lapsed Methodist who now counts himself an agnostic.  Politically, I consider myself a small-L libertarian who is pragmatic enough to realize that the market doesn't rule everything and that government still has some roles to play in protecting people who can't protect themselves.  I have no truck with any Democrats (or others) who want to remove all risk and personal responsibility from individual lives; in a former life I might have been a Theodore Roosevelt Progressive or a Willkie Republican.  But in my lifetime I've seen the Republican Party leadership seek to divide the electorate racially and economically for its political gain, appealing to white racism to lock up the old Confederacy and using \\"moral values\\" as a red herring for GOP politicians who damn the left for the vulgarity of our popular culture while praising the corporations that commercialize and promote the vulgarity. (FOX News and FOX TV:  Balanced fare.)  Neither party has clean hands, but the Democrats offer the best hope and flexibility for reforming and for rebuilding a strong and inclusive American political center. <br /> <br />That center needs both Republicans and Democrats, which is why Wallis' book is so important.  It's vital for rank-and-file Republican Christians, to make the diversity of their views known to their leadership and to the media, and not let just the hard-line fundamentalist faction represent all Christians in their party.  Wallis demonstrates that the gospel of Jesus Christ  commands us to love, forgive, and seek justice, not simply to prosper and judge.  He emphasizes that Jesus Christ intended his followers to be a welcoming community, not a closed band of self-serving individualists.  He shows, indeed, that much of current Republican policy is antithetical to the teachings of Jesus. <br /> <br />The non-religious \\"left,\\" too, would benefit from closely examining Wallis's take on the true meaning of Christ's teachings.  Too many people conceal their own dearth of conviction by belittling the strongly held beliefs of others, rather than than trying to understand them.  Wallis makes a great case for why so many Americans consider \\"values\\" issues to be as important as \\"economic\\" issues; indeed, for Wallis, they are to a large extent the same thing.  Democrats must learn to address all issues as \\"values\\" issues - not just to win votes and elections, but to genuinely bring about change. <br /> <br />Although Wallis is strongly anti-abortion (though not strictly \\"anti-choice,\\" at least that I could detect), his demands forpeace, justice, and tolerance will no doubt create suspicion among certain of the self-righteous and convince some Republicans that he is merely a yellow-dog Democrat wearing an Evangelical collar. It is not surprising that many \\"conservatives\\" find Wallis's theology one-sided. The Bible contains much wisdom (and one can take it seriously even if he doesn't take it literally), but it also contradicts itself.  Wallis advocates a Biblical approach to public policy that stems from a different interpretation of the scriptures -- and is that not what American religious freedom is about?  Moreover, critics of Wallis need to ask themselves a simple question: Is his interpretation antithetical to the words and teachings of Jesus Christ? Or antithetical to the political baggage that Christianity has attracted in the past twenty centuries or so?   <br /> <br />Bottom line:  For Christians who voted for George W. Bush in 2004, here's a chance to reassess how the current Republican Party leadership really lines up with the core beliefs of all Evangelicals.  For Democrats, especially the non-religious ones and moderates like myself, here's our opportunity to make common ground with a substantial number of Evangelicals (and other devout people) whose values are more like our own than they are like Karl Rove's.  For all Americans, \\"God's Politics\\" is a call to put aside the labels used to divide us and to ask, \\"What do I really believe in?\\" and \\"What political party really expresses those beliefs?  Or at least has the real potential to do so?\\"  Difference of belief and opinion is not the same as divisiveness, if there are core values that the large majority of Americans and human beings can hold in common. <br /> <br />Down side:  Sorry, Jim - lots of good ideas and anecdotes but wayyyy too much redundancy and repetition and saying things ten different ways and so forth.  Could have been just as forceful in half the space.	2005-07-20

However, readers looking for war stories about the exploits of the men who flew the Mitchell and the Marauder in World War II are likely to be disappointed, as Mendenhall concentrates mainly on the technical aspects of the craft.    That's the strong point of his narrative, but readers unfamiliar with aviation technology and jargon might find some of his detailed descriptions of the intricacies of landing gear and wing assemblies hard to follow, if not downright boring.  For the more technically oriented, however, these are the strongest chapters in the book, and while Mendenhall is not a particularly vivid writer, he does a decent job in making his technical descriptions intelligible and easy to follow.    The historical material on the design, testing, manufacture, and deployment of the B-25 and B-26 also is handled well and thoroughly.  For those who are interested, Mendenhall painstakingly details the different design changes that each plane underwent -- e.g., the transition of the Mitchell from a high-level bomber to a low-altitude attack plane (some equipped with a 75mm cannon, no less!), and the initial difficulties with the Marauder's \\"stubby\\" wings.  After many operational accidents the bomber's wings were extended by six feet, which helped make it a less unforgiving plane to fly.    Mendenhall gives a general description of the deployment of the aircraft during WWII, listing the major theaters in which they were used as well as many of the USAAF and other units to which the planes were assigned. (The British Royal Air Force and the Soviet Union each received roughly 900 Mitchells during the war, and many other air forces also used the plane.) With the exception of the Jimmy Doolittle's famous raid on Japan in April 1942, in which 16 B-25s flew from the deck of the USS Hornet, there are few operational details about the  missions ofeither aircraft.  However, Mendenhall provides interesting information of how the two planes came to be assigned to certain combat areas -- the B-26 was removed from the Pacific and restricted to the European theater from 1943 onward, while the B-25 was relegated largely to the Asia/Pacific and Mediterranean areas and hardly used at all by the Britain-based Eighth AAF in northern Europe.    Perhaps the most attractive aspect of \\"The Deadly Duo\\" are the numerous illustrations. There are dozens of photographs documenting the design changes in the two aircraft as well as combat photos and even a gallery of post-war conversions as civilian business transports. Mendenhall also provides several of his own highly detailed drawings of the planes.    Again, this is an excellent resource on the development and technical aspects of these two important aircraft.  Other books might be more informative about the planes in combat and about the men who took them there, but Mendenhall provides an appreciation of the imagination and hard work it took to get the Mitchell and Marauder into the hands of the aviators who made them legends.	2005-06-08
US	20947016	R2ETOZP1IAMP9D	0609610589	484647692	Blood Done Sign My Name: A True Story	Books	5	19	23	N	N	Outstanding Combination of Memoir and History	This was both an exhilarating and painful book to read -- exhilarating in that Timothy Tyson is a fine writer with a gripping story to relate, and painful in that the story he tells resounds with scathing truths that all Southerners who lived through the era of civil rights activism in the 1960s and 1970s will recognize and feel. <br /> <br />Many North Carolinians like to think of their state as a relatively progressive place in racial matters, at least compared to states of the Deep South.  And much racial progress has been made there, as it has throughout the United States, since the 1960s.  Perhaps I am a dishonest white man, but I don't believe any thinking person can dwell on this country's past injustices without conceding that many Americans have recognized the existence of civic wrongs and continue working to eradicate them.  Much progress, of course, is hardly enough progress.  There's more to do, more minds to be educated and changed, more healing time to pass.  And no state, no nation, no species that hopes to maintain progress can lose sight of its past sins or cease to wonder how they came about. (The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill recently chose \\"Blood Done Sign My Name\\" for its 2005 Summer Reading Program, meaning that all of this fall's incoming freshmen are being asked to read it and discuss it.) <br /> <br />Southern literary historian Fred Hobson has developed the term \\"racial conversion narrative\\" to describe accounts by white Southerners who came to realize the evils of the racist beliefs on which they were raised.  In a review of Tyson's book in the journal \\"Southern Cultures,\\" Hobson stated that \\"Blood Done Sign My Name\\" was not a racial conversion narrative, save in the broadest sense.  I would disagree, for the transformation of racial attitudes among the Tyson family, father and son, and the impact of that transformation, is the heart of this book.  The killing of Henry Marrow in Oxford, North Carolina, on May 11, 1970, was agalvanizing incident in Timothy Tyson's life, but it was just part of a childhood into which North Carolina's traditions of racial discrimination and segregation intruded.  For Tyson, these traditions presented much more conflict than for most white kids of that era.  Tyson's father, Vernon, was a Methodist minister, whom the son portrays as a man who gradually defied the racial traditions of his family and culture to arrive at a simple conclusion:  that his Christian faith demanded from him a love for all people and a condemnation of racial injustice.  Tyson's mother, also Southern-born, strongly supported her husband's views, but it was his father's actions - especially in inviting black preachers and worshippers to the all-white churches he pastored - that drew fire from his church members and the North Carolina communities he served (not just Oxford).  Tyson effectively relates the impact of these events on his own maturing, from boyhood to a chaotic adolescence to a budding historian determined to understand his past and willing to confront it head on. <br /> <br />Not surprisingly, \\"Blood Done Sign My Name\\" also addresses Tyson's professional interest in civil rights history - the conflict between the popular memory of the Civil Rights movement and the reality of the black struggle for political and social equality. The movement is most frequently personified in Dr. Martin Luther King, whose Gandhian strategy of non-violence supposedly shamed white America into ending legal racial discrimination.  As I understand him, Tyson the historian believes that more aggressive black leaders, including many willing to use or at least threaten violence, played as much a role in the movement as King.  Years before King's assassination in 1968, black men and women were arming themselves and preaching black \\"self-defense\\" against white oppressors. (Tyson profiled one such black leader in \\"Radio Free Dixie: Robert F. Williams and the Roots of Black Power,\\" published in 2001).By the time Henry Marrow was killed in 1970, the patience of many black Americans, especially the young, had worn painfully thin.  Marrow's death, and the subsequent acquittal of the white men who killed him, inspired both nonviolent protests and incidents of violence (mainly against property) from black North Carolinians that made the state's white establishment sit up and take some notice of continuing black discontent.  Tyson's family later moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, another hotbed of racial strife in the early `70s. A leader of the Oxford protests, Ben Chavis, would be convicted for allegedly leading a violent conspiracy in Wilmington in 1971 that resulted in arson, shootings, and deaths.  (Chavis's conviction, along with those of the others of the \\"Wilmington Ten,\\" was overturned by a federal appeals court in 1980.)  Tyson tells of his family's involvement in these events, and he delves much farther back into North Carolina's racist past in relating the brutal riot by whites against black citizens of Wilmington in 1898, an episode that largely destroyed a budding bi-racial political movement in the state. <br /> <br />No doubt it was the black men and women of the United States who bore the largest burden and paid the greatest price to bring about the civil rights advances of the 20th century.  But their sacrifices would not have accomplished nearly so much had not many white Americans like Vernon Tyson had the courage to \\"convert\\" and defy, often at the risk of their lives and livelihoods, the racial conventions of the time.  One can argue that such people were, finally, only doing the right thing, but their actions, and the examples and standards they set for other white Americans, should never be disregarded, much less trashed.  Timothy Tyson's memoir of his father and mother, and of their impact on his own \\"conversion,\\" is what makes this book so readable and so memorable - particularly for we white Southern Boomers who underwent similar transformations.  More importantly, \\"Blood Done Sign My Name\\" is a call to continue confronting, and questioning, our racial past as a nation, and our racial beliefs as individuals.	2005-05-29

However, having also read several enthusiastic reviews of Goldberg's book by other Amazon contributors, I was impressed with how many readers felt their own prior belief in \\"liberal media bias\\" had been validated in \\"Arrogance.\\"  I fear that a lot of people will read \\"The Republican Noise Machine\\" looking for just that kind of validation of their passionate perception of a \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\" in the nation's news media.  No news organization, no reporter, is free of the cultural biases that influence all of us.  A \\"liberal\\" can be just a quick to jump to conclusions or be \\"selective\\" in including or excluding facts as anyone elsewhere on that simplistic political spectrum. One of the great dangers alluded to in Brock's book is the growing tendency of news consumers to read and view only what \\"confirms\\" their preconceptions -- a human failing, perhaps, but a failing nonetheless.    Having said that, I found Brock's evidence of a \\"conservative\\" media cabal more convincing than Goldberg's claims for \\"liberal\\" dominance.  Of course, they're talking about two different types of media distortion.  Goldberg sees primarily a bias of culture in the Elite Media, which he portrays as an exclusive club, sitting smug in its coastal enclaves, looking down its nose on the rest of the country.  But, Goldberg says, there's no organized left-wing conspiracy to dominate Big Media - the bias occurs because \\"the club\\" is so restrictive as to who can become a member.  (One wonders how in hell Dan Rather was allowed in?)      Brock, on the other hand, makes a valid case for a well-organized, well-financed campaign by \\"conservative\\" Republicans over the past 35 years or so to dominate various channels of information by which Americans get the news - and to shift the parameters of public debate \\"back\\" toward the right's agenda.  Chapter by chapter, he lays out a plausible narrative detailing the interaction of certain foundations and corporate funders, conservative think tanks and religious organizations, Republican politicians, and journalists-with-agendas who move easily across ethical lines.  The sheer size of the enterprise is staggering, encompassing not only obvious right-wing organs like Fox News and \\"The Washington Times,\\" but at least portions of the \\"liberal\\" media that Goldberg assails - e.g., \\"The Washington Post\\" and CNN.  The usual suspects whom \\"liberals\\" love to hate - Limbaugh, Coulter, O'Reilly - are given ample space, along with less-well-known advocates of a \\"conservative\\" propaganda network - Richard Mellon Scaife, Brent Bozell III, William Kristol, Roger Ailes and many others.      There are times when the sheer volume of information Brock presents in \\"The Republican Noise Machine\\" seems a bit numbing, but little of it is extraneous.  My only major quibble is that there are not more notes detailing sources of information, but this doesn't affect the overall credibility of the book.      Brock's earlier \\"expose\\" of the \\"conservative\\" media, \\"Blinded by the Right,\\" was essentially the personalized confession of a rather naive young man who seems to have been disillusioned not only by the right-wing media's lack of integrity and journalistic ethics, but by the Republican party leadership's hypocritical anti-gay agenda.  The earlier book came across as a little whiney, however credible its insights.  \\"The Republican Noise Machine\\" is a far more solid piece of work.  Brock doesn't offer any \\"solutions\\" to the issue of right-wing media bias, save the obvious - constant monitoring of media misstatements, half-truths, and outright lies, and greater support for news outlets that strive for the unobtainable - and, thus, all the more noble - ideal of objective reporting.	2005-04-18
US	20947016	R2JWELBFLKIUE9	0446693642	635347725	Arrogance: Rescuing America From The Media Elite	Books	2	7	21	N	N	Media conspiracy that panders to conservatives	Caution: Reviewed by a former newspaper reporter and lifelong Democrat.    Some of Bernard Goldberg's \\"Arrogance\\" is valid, and his Twelve Steps for reforming the news industry contain some worthy proposals.  People in the news media need a regular reality check when it comes to letting personal feelings and opinions influence the stories they cover and how they cover them.  Goldberg includes an ample number of anecdotes to demonstrate that reporters and editors can get lazy and let their preconceptions and assumptions take the place of the gruntwork of journalism.  And, thank goodness, Goldberg adamantly rejects the notion that there is some sort of industry-wide conspiracy to slant the news.  Most newspeople are in a profit-driven business as competitive as any other, only more so; they are not inclined to help one another and frequently (though not publicly) take pleasure in one another's gaffes.  That makes them only human, not conspirators.    Unfortunately, Goldberg obscures much of the good in \\"Arrogance\\" with whiney anecdotes about the usual suspects - Dan Rather and \\"The New York Times\\" lead his pack of liberal whipping boys - as well as some less familiar targets (Goldberg really has it in for Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism) that seem to have been hand-picked by a gaggle of Republican focus groups.  Let's see - what names can I drop to start those members of the Conservative Book Club salivating over this month's featured selection?  Hillary, Barbara, Barbra, Brock, Raines, Rather (again! and again!)  I haven't read Goldberg's earlier bash at the media, \\"Bias,\\" but \\"Arrogance\\" seems a bit too obviously concocted to recreate the appeal of \\"Bias\\" to kneejerk conservatives who want to believe in the worst way that they are  oppressed by the News Nazis in New York and Washington.  I could have taken more seriously Goldberg's tales of liberal media abuse if he had also addressed the similar sins committed by the righties.  But, then, the Conservative Book Club wouldn't have featured his book.    Goldberg concentrates his fire on the \\"media elite\\" - the TV networks and CNN, \\"Time,\\" \\"Newsweek,\\" \\"The New York Times\\" and \\"The Washington Post\\" - that was his environment in his 28 years at CBS.  He believes that these elites are lousy with liberals, to the exclusion of those with \\"other\\" perspectives.  Conservatives, religious believers, those who graduated from the \\"wrong\\" college need not apply to CBS or the \\"Times,\\" he contends.  He supplies no stats to back up these allegations, although there have been surveys done by various organizations that indicate that self-described liberals outnumber conservatives in the elite media.  (See the Media Research Centers's website, [...])  (Of course, these surveys also show self-described \\"moderates\\" outnumbering both liberals and conservatives put together, but who can believe anything professed by the wishy-washy middle?)  Goldberg seems to dismiss the diversity found in the news outlets of America's smaller cities and towns (not to mention on the Internet) that inform millions who don't take the \\"Times\\" (and that don't pay nearly as well as Bernie was paid at CBS).  His description of five Heartland cities that would help enlighten New York-obsessed journalists is extremely patronizing.    Why do liberals seem to dominate the elite media?  There are, no doubt, some liberals who see journalism as a means of influencing public policy.  If they're lucky, such ideologues get to work on publications with unabashedly leftist agendas that will accommodate their expressions of outrage over this immorality or that injustice.  Strangely, the conservative ideologues who go into journalism seek the same thing, often at the same (mirror-image) type of publication.  Many others who seek careers in journalism go to work for newsrooms where, fortunately, there are still editors who strive for the unobtainable ideal of objectivity, who keep their antennae tuned for opinions seeping into news stories, for \\"holes\\" in a story that indicate sloppy or indifferent reporting, and for plain human error.  (I once wrote a story on a political candidate's financial contributors - nothing sensational, essentially a straightforward listing - but I unintentionally miscalculated some of the figures and wound up overstating some amounts, and my editors missed the mistake.  The  candidate phoned and jumped all over me for my little newspaper's \\"liberal bias.\\"  The only bias was my dislike of math class.  The story got a front-page correction next day.)  Some have suggested that those who have gone into journalism since the 1960s tend to be better-educated than reporters of previous generations (when a \\"college boy\\" in the newsroom was pretty rare, and college girls in the newsroom were almost non-existent); and that a little education tends to lead some people to shun a black/white, good/evil, liberal/conservative view of society.    What really makes a newsroom \\"liberal,\\" however, is the very nature of \\"the news.\\"  By definition, \\"the news\\" is not the quotidian events of public and private lives.  Airplanes that don't crash, school kids who don't go berserk with a gun, nations that remain at peace, oil prices that remain stable - these are seldom the stuff of \\"news\\" because we are used to them and can gauge the influence they have on our own lives.  \\"News\\" is inherently extraordinary, disturbing, discomforting, disruptive of our emotional security.  Our comfort is often due to our ignorance; new information is assault and battery on our ignorance, and at times the truth indeed can hurt.  The news consumer, whether he or she counts himself liberal, conservative, or moderate, Republican, Democrat, or Independent, has to accept this fact and live with it -- else, the news consumer becomes a soft target for soothing pabulum that simply reinforces what he already thinks he knows.    Goldberg says that newsrooms need more diversity, more people who \\"think likeAmerica\\" instead of like the denizens of the coastal elitist enclaves.  How does he propose to do this - establish quotas for Democrats and Republicans, Christians and non-Christians, gays and straights?  Quiz prospective journalists on whether they own a firearm, eat sushi, or prefer Woody Allen films to Vin Diesel movies?  Of course not.  I never had a newspaper editor ask me about my politics in a job interview.  (Maybe they just assumed that I was a liberal.  Yeah, that's it.)  They were only interested in whether I could write and knew something about the issues I proposed to cover.  Goldberg implies only another and more execrable form of political correctness.    The elite news media are not without their sins, and Goldberg rightly slams them for insularity and, yes, for smugness.  But his criticisms would be much more believable did they not seem so personal -- and so calculated to sell books to all those Dittoheads.    P.S.  If you really believe in fairness, balance, and an open mind, challenge yourself by reading Eric Alterman's \\"What Liberal Media?\\" and David Brock's \\"The Republican Noise Machine.\\"	2005-03-25

Unfortunately, this is not a finished work of history.  It is perfunctorily written, and the chapters are poorly organized.  It contains some excellent information, but it is not a book for the casual reader or even the casual Civil War buff.    The antebellum South, and the Confederacy it spawned, was a complex place -- 9 million individuals, white and black, whose support of, opposition to, or acceptance of slavery and secession stemmed from a thousand different motives.  If one can generalize about the slave South, it is to say that an attitude of white supremacy and black inferiority prevailed among its white citizens (as it did in the North); and that African-Americans, both slave and free, who lived in the slave states were subjected to a stifling degree of legal control by slave owners and state governments.  Jordan goes over these two major points -- already familiar to students of the era -- in the first section of the book, \\"Uncertain Trumpet.\\"  The breadth of his research is commendable, but his technique of relating it is a bit numbing; a string of paragraphs, each a topic sentence and several redundant supporting anecdotes, is hardly historical analysis, much less a readable narrative.  Some of the anecdotes are powerful -- e.g., a slave mother is haunted by the sound of her owner's piano, purchased with the proceeds from the sale of the slave's daughter -- and the author would have done better to concentrate on those, to examine their meaning more closely.    The most controversial parts of the book are in the second half (\\"Give Us a Flag\\") and deal with black Virginians who served the Confederate cause either by taking up arms in its defense or voluntarily supporting the white soldiers who did.  As have many other authors (including Confederate apologists who continue to deny that the Civil War and theConfederacy were essentially about slavery and racism), Jordan cites numerous anecdotes about black Virginians fighting with Rebel forces or serving as cooks, teamsters, servants, musicians, laborers, and in other noncombatant roles in the Confederate armies and government.  He also supplies a fair amount of anecdotal evidence for a deep split among white Southerners over the propriety of arming slaves.  Even as the Confederacy was sliding to destruction in the spring of 1865, many whites were adamantly opposed to the tardy steps taken by the Confederate congress to organize black fighting units.  This ongoing opposition from all corners of the Confederacy -- not to mention the overall pattern of racism and subjugation of blacks in Civil War America -- calls into serious question the value of the anecdotal evidence often cited to \\"prove\\" widespread African-American support for the Southern cause, because it implies widespread white gratitude for this support.  Examining this topic alone would have been a worthwhile book.  As other reviewers here state, Jordan could have done a much more thorough job in testing this anecdotal evidence.    There seems to be little question that some African-Americans supported the Confederate war effort, including military service, even before 1865.  But to what extent?  To what military effect?  Did the arming of some slaves, or the volunteering of some blacks for military or quasi-military duty, have any widespread impact on the racial and political attitudes of white Southerners?  Were these \\"Afro-Confederates\\" genuine Southern patriots, or infrequent exceptions to the repressive laws of racism and slavery, or simply black men and women who sought to ingratiate themselves with their white owners and the white community?  These are questions that Jordan raises in this book, and that's a start.  I hope he'll spend some time and a couple of other books trying to answer them.	2005-03-06

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	3	21	26	N	N	Entertaining, informatative, but misses the point --	As a lifelong Democrat residing in a very red state, I had a great hopes for this book.  Frank is an engaging writer, and his analysis of what's happened to his native Kansas -- that mid-century bastion of moderate Republicanism -- over the past twenty years is in many respects dead on.  GOP conservatives have seduced centrist Kansas into supporting a rightwing political agenda that works against the economic well-being of the average Kansas family, Frank claims.  The \\"Cons\\" have used abortion, gun control, evolution, homosexuality, and other \\"cultural\\" issues to create a general resentment against Democratic \\"elitists\\" and even against moderate Republicans.  Moreover, Frank argues, the \\"Cons\\" know full well that such issues are unlikely to resolved legislatively but keep thumping them to stir up more resentment of \\"liberalism.\\" <br /> <br />Frank misses the point, however, in suggesting that that the Democratic party must return to its \\"roots\\" (or at least, the 1950s-60s) to win back the moderates and win some elections in red states like Kansas.  He sees the Democrats as regaining their  competitiveness through a revitalized labor movement and enlightened middle-class voters who will vote their pocketbooks rather than their religious beliefs or cultural fears.  What Frank fails to comprehend is that most American workers -- the most likely voters, anyway -- have moved beyond economic issues that propelled Democratic majorities in the 1930s and 1940s. The Democrats did their work almost too well over the past 70 years; they helped boost the American working and middle classes into a semi-comfortable (if often tenuous) standard of living that has allowed them the luxury of ignoring many pocketbook issues in favor of dealing with social changes that the \\"Cons\\" have hyped up into apocalyptic threats to the nation's future. (How many Americans over age 40 voted for Dubya specifically to slash their future Social Security benefits?) By often ignoring and even ridiculingthe religious/cultural-issue concerns, the Democrats have managed to lose some close national elections and provide the GOP with majorities in Congress. <br /> <br />The Democrats can start to win national elections again, and perhaps win back Congress, by addressing cultural issues as well as economic concerns.  The Dems (and GOP moderates who are growing increasingly disenchanted with the rightward tilt of their party) must seek ways to educate hostile voters without talking down to them, to find common ground in the middle of the political spectrum and address the fears of these voters whose financial interests would best be served by traditional Democratic principals.  Although these cultural issues may indeed resist legislative resolution, as Frank argues, they are nonetheless very real to many voters and supersede economic concerns.  Future Democratic candidates will ignore them at their peril. <br /> <br />Frustrated Democrats will find \\"What's the Matter with Kansas?\\" thought-provoking and informative, but Frank doesn't have the answer to the party's current electoral woes.	2005-03-01

Richard Schickel published this book in 1985, a few years after making a documentary about James Cagney that was released around the time of the actor's last theatrical feature, \\"Ragtime.\\" Schickel interviewed Cagney for the documentary as \\"Ragtime\\" was being filmed in 1980, and he based this book on that and other conversations with the actor late in Cagney's life.     Although this long essay contains a great deal of information about Cagney's life and film career, Schickel did not set out to write a conventional biography.  His main topic is the development of Cagney's screen persona, the \\"tough guy\\" character that Cagney (and Warner Brothers) created, played, and refined in more than sixty film roles. Schickel is interested in the way that this cinematic character reflected many of the country's social concerns during the 1930s, Cagney's first decade in the movies, and after.  He traces that development from the actor's first major starring role in \\"The Public Enemy\\" (1931) through his last major gangster role in \\"White Heat\\" (1949).  He also shows how that persona emerged, or was altered, in other Cagney films, notably \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\" (1942), for which Cagney received his only Academy Award.  Schickel notes that Cagney was a little ahead of his time when, in 1943, he left Warner Brothers and established his own production company (and made a rather undistinguished string of pictures); and he traces how Cagney's character fared in the late 1940s and 1950s, a time that saw Cagney's star fade until his \\"retirement\\" in 1961.  The actor came out of retirement in 1980 to appear in \\"Ragtime\\" in a small but crucial role; his last film was a rather dreary TV movie made in 1984, by which time Cagney was so frail his lines had to be dubbed by another actor doing a Cagney imitation.    Schickel also is interested in Cagney's reluctance to talk about his film career in creative terms (save for a handful of fondly remembered films, such as \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\"). Cagney seems to have placed very little value on the work he did in the 1930s, on the character he created, perhaps because Cagney's \\"tough guy\\" was so at odds with the real man.  Like many actors, Cagney  did not intellectualize about what he did on the screen; his art was instinctual, visceral, not cerebral.  Cagney thought of himself as a lucky song-and-dance man who found a relatively easy way to make a very good living when he was in his early 30s.  With few exceptions, each role he played was \\"just a job\\" to Cagney, no matter how much those roles enthralled and thrilled his admirers.    One might say that this book is less about Cagney and more about Schickel's own reaction to Cagney's screen persona and career.  It's definitely more a work of criticism than biography or history.  (There is, however, enough biographical information here to provide a good introduction to Cagney for those who know little or nothing about his career. There are also many good photos.)  But for those who admire Cagney's work, Schickel has written a valuable assessment of just why this exceptional actor -- and quiet, gentle man offscreen -- was, and is, such a treasure to American cinema.	2005-01-22
US	20947016	R1WFTT3FCN67E3	0609607081	30726731	Rammer Jammer Yellow Hammer: A Journey into the Heart of Fan Mania	Books	4	2	3	N	N	For true believers and football agnostics alike	First, a disclaimer:  This reviewer is a die-hard Florida Gator (and he's hard-dyin' today, after our New Year's Eve humiliation at the hands of the Miami Hurricanes in the Peach Bowl), which undoubtedly colors my opinion of this book. That said, I'd recommend \\"Rammer Jammer Yellowhammer\\" to any serious college football fan, if only for a reality check.  And for anyone who wishes to understand college football fandom -- especially in the South -- this is a good starting point.    Marino Casem, longtime coach at Mississippi's Alcorn State University, made the oft-quoted observation that \\"Football is, in the West, a cultural experience; in the Midwest, cannibalism; in the East, a tourist attraction; but, in the South, football is a religion, and Saturday is the holy day.\\" \\"Rammer Jammer Yellowhammer\\" is an Alabama fan's attempt to fathom that religious experience by following a group of RV-driving Crimson Tide faithful on their season-long pilgrimage to stadiums around the Southeastern Conference.    The religiosity of Alabama football fans is a special case, even for the South.  There are no major league pro teams in their home state for Alabamians to worship, so the Crimson Tide and the Auburn Tigers are the icons in their sports universe; and if the South at large is \\"Christ-haunted\\" (in the words of Flannery O'Connor), Alabama also is haunted by the spirit of Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant.  Elevated to Christ-like status in his 23 years as head coach in Tuscaloosa (22 winning seasons, 13 SEC championships, six national championships), Bryant`s shadow has darkened the tenure of every succeeding University of Alabama football coach since he retired at the end of the 1982 season and succumbed to a heart attack just a month later.  As with Steve Spurrier at Florida, Bryant raised expectations of consistent victory to unrealistic heights among his fans.  As a boy, Alabama-born Warren St. John had the privilege of meeting the Bear, and he appreciates the mystique that Bryant stillgenerates in the Heart of Dixie, as well as the heartbreak that Tide fans have experienced when succeeding coaches fail to continue Bryant's winning ways.    It's interesting that St. John chose to make his Crimson Tide pilgrimage during the fall of 1999, when Bama was reeling from two disappointing seasons and a sex scandal that involved head coach Mike DuBose.  Perhaps St. John needed to see the truest believers (as opposed to fair-weather fans) up close, before the Millenium.  (Why did he wait until 2004 to publish the book, though?  As it worked out, the Tide wound up 10-3 in 1999 and beat Florida for the SEC championship.  They haven't done as well since then.)  Whatever, St. John's account of his adventures with the Tide's RV camp followers, while not especially insightful, is amusing and an excellent read (mostly).  If you are a serious college football fan, you'll probably recognize many of these people (despite a few grotesques St. John wrote about), and perhaps yourself.  If you're not one of the faithful (and I mean to college football), you can still laugh and feel smugly superior to we poor believers in God's chosen game.    Since it's about the 1999 season, there are some anachronisms in the book.  For example, the University of Florida no longer allows fans to leave home games at halftime and re-enter the stadium after a few drinks.  There have been a few coaching changes in the Southeastern Conference since 1999.  But the book's major weakness is St. John's attempt to incorporate academic analysis into what should have remained a straightforward chronicle of Alabama football fandom.  The book reads extremely well until those sections where St. John cites this authority or that scholar about sports fans and sports loyalties.  Then the book comes to a dead stop.  Really, you can skim these passages.    Neither St. John nor anyone else should be surprised to find white racists among the faithful of the Tide or any other SEC team.  Racism twisted everything in the South, and still does, only less so. There's still a good book to be written about the transformation of Southern college football since the 1960s due to racial integration of the teams and universities, but that's not what St. John was trying to do here.  \\"Rammer Jammer Yellowhammer\\" is one literate fan's effort to understand and explain the religious experience that is Crimson Tide football.  He is honest enough to conclude that, like many adherents to the true church, his loyalty to Bama (rather than, say, Auburn) is largely irrational.  Like all faiths, it just IS - but it gets us through the day, and the season.	2005-01-03

No, he allowed, he'd heard of it but was turned off by the prospect of reading something that celebrated secession and the defense of slavery that we both see as having been the core values of the Confederacy.   <br /> <br />That sensibility is understandable, but if you are reticent about buying or reading some Southern nationalist fantasy that presents Confederate victory and independence as the desirable outcome of the Civil War, you need not fear \\"Dixie Victorious.\\"  At least one of the ten contributors (Wade G. Dudley) states bluntly that one should be thankful his scenario of Confederate triumph did not come to pass. \\"[Confederate] victory would have meant the continuation of the institution of slavery, an institution that the South would not have willingly abandoned for generations (if at all).\\"  On the other hand, contributor Kevin F. Kiley projects Virginia's abolition of slavery in 1870 and the Confederacy's total abandonment of the \\"peculiar institution\\" by 1900, following the fictional death of Lincoln and the electoral defeat of the Republican administration in 1864.  And Tsouras himself portrays a drastic transformation of Southern (and Northern) race relations following a Southern victory brought about in large part by the Confederacy's (fictional) decision in 1864 to enlist black combat troops into its armies. (That official decision actually was made less than a month before Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, far too late to affect the overall outcome of the war.)  But there is no overall sense in this collection that a Confederate victory would have been for the best. <br /> <br />Mostly, the contributors to \\"Dixie Victorious\\" concentrate on the military impacts of some relatively small changes in the historical record - e.g., the immediate presence of Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston's personal physician at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 saves the general from bleeding to death (as he actually did, because no one was around to put a tourniquet on his leg wound).  James R. Arnold conjectures that Johnston's survival at Shiloh enabled him to lead the (fictionalized) campaign that saved Vicksburg for the Confederacy a year later.  David M. Keithly and Michael R. Hathaway both offer counterfactual outcomes of Lee's 1862 invasion of Maryland (that actually ended with a nominal Union victory at Antietam) that lead to Confederate victory in the war.  Among the most interesting scenarios are Dudley's depiction of the triumph of Rebel ironclads over the Union blockade in the spring of 1862 and Cyril M. Lagvanec's fictionalized account of the 1864 Red River campaign in Louisiana.  The latter was in fact a Union fiasco, but Lagvanec argues that a few little twists could have made this often-ignored event the turning point of the war and a key to Confederate victory. <br /> <br />The contributors also are allowed to have some fun.  Each historian presents an authentic bibliography, but the endnotes for most chapters are a mixture of actual sources and some provocatively fanciful ones (\\"From Manassas to Manila Bay: The Campaigns of James Ewell Brown Stuart\\").   <br /> <br />The real purpose of such conjectures, as Tsouras points out, is to emphasize just how close the Confederacy came to winning the war -- how a relatively minor incident (e.g., Lee's actual injury just prior to the Maryland invasion in 1862) might have had major consequences. (MacKinlay Kantor posited just two alterations of fact to change the course of history in \\"If the South Had Won the Civil War,\\" which presents a more thorough projection of the aftermath of Confederate victory.)  For those who are already familiar with the actual military and political courses of the Civil War, \\"Dixie Victorious\\" is not just an amusement. The book illuminates the issues of these Civil War campaigns and encourages new ways of viewing them.  It's well worth your time.	2004-09-03

His account of the Bushes' often heavily veiled involvement in international investments (especially in the oil industry), the U.S. intelligence establishment, Republican politics, and, more recently, in \\"evangelical Republicanism,\\" are enlightening as to how wealth and power are developed and maintained in modern America.<br />The Bad:  For those of us who would use this book as a club to help knock George W. Bush out of the White House in November 2004, it is a rather unwieldy weapon.  Phillips's evident dislike of the two Presidents Bush is muted and hardly undercuts the evidence he brings forth regarding their financial, political, and intelligence activities over the years.  But the story is a very complex one, involving many threads that Phillips tries to weave into a coherent storyline.  He doesn't always succeed.  If you are looking for a book to present to a pro-Bush friend or relative, as I was, as a very obvious \\"smoking gun\\" with which to argue against Dubya's re-election, this just ain't it, despite all the valid, sound information Phillips presents.<br />The real value of this book, which is why I can rate it so highly and recommend it to anyone, is in demonstrating the way that America's corporate/government establishment really works.  There is a strong case to be made that the machinations of this establishment over the past one hundred years, however sinister they may seem to some people, have produced a strong and prosperous United States.  But one may also question, as Phillips does, whether the secret dealings of a relative handful of powerful men and families are always in the best interest of either Americans as individuals or of America as democratic society.  One has only to consider the current war in Iraq:  Our president states that we invaded Iraq, essentially, to defend America's security and freedom by overthrowing an evil dictator; but one is led to believe that, in the mind of George W. Bush and his corporate supporters, \\"security\\" means the preservation of their own wealth and power, which means preserving the present U.S. economic structure; and that preservation is directly tied to an uninterrupted flow of oil from the wells of the Mideast to the gasoline tanks and power plants of the United States.  They see their own interests as the interests of all Americans.<br />Could they be right?  Think of the disruption in the U.S. economy - in the global economy for that matter - if Mideastern oil supplies were suddenly and substantially diminished.  Our society and lifestyle have been built upon cheap gasoline and electricity, provided by fossil fuels.  The Bushes and their cronies understand this reality with a depth that most Americans can hardly comprehend.  And, as Phillips argues, the average American increasingly seems willing to trust his or her rights (and obligations) of citizenship to an imperialistic U.S. government controlled by political and corporate elites.  Many of these elites probably mean well in serving all Americans, but is their dominance in our government and in our economy a sign of a decaying democracy?<br />What Phillips sees at stake is not just the influence of the Bush family and the re-election of George W., but America's democratic legacy itself.  He points out that Democrats, too, have their elites and dynasties (Democrat Averill Harriman -- railroad heir, diplomat and New York governor -- was a close business associate of the Bushes; and if you count Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Kennedy dynasty now encompasses both major political parties).  Rumors that Hillary Clinton is determined to seek the White House reinforce Phillips's contention that some Americans, at least, find something comforting in such familial continuity holding the reins of power.<br />This is not a book that is going to dissuade a fervent Bush supporter from voting for his re-election; a \\"swing\\" voter who is willing to take the time to read the book might find it influential. But \\"American Dynasty\\" is most definitely a book that will enlighten those with the eyes to see just how the establishment works.  The Bushes, for better or worse, are definitely a part of that establishment.<br />Quibble: Lots of source endnotes (and not just from \\"Vanity Fair!\\") but no bibliography.	2004-07-11

US	20947016	R1XBIIVF6M2QS0	1557509484	996740984	They Were Expendable: An American Torpedo Boat Squadron in the U.S. Retreat from the Philippines (Bluejacket Books)	Books	5	52	56	N	N	An emotional saga of American military defeat	This is not a book to read as history, in the sense of seeking facts and figures about an event in the past.  \\"They Were Expendable\\" is ostensibly an account of the exploits of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 3, which gained glory amidst the disaster that was America's defense of the Philippine Islands in the opening months of the war with Japan (December 1941 - May 1942).  But this is wartime journalism, and it is replete with inaccuracies and exaggerations, not to mention a few passages that were subjected to military censorship.  This must be expected of a book that was written only a few weeks after Allied resistance of the Philippines formally ended in humiliating surrender; William L. White had no way to corroborate or fact-check the stories told to him by the four youthful naval officers he interviewed for this book.  But as an emotional record of the early, sometimes despairing days of the war against Japan, \\"They Were Expendable\\" is a work of truth and power.  This is not so much a slam-bang story of naval warfare as it is an account of the emotional trauma of defeat suffered by a nation accustomed to victory.<br />White originally wrote the book for \\"The Reader's Digest,\\" which published a condensed version in its September, 1942, issue, not quite four months after the fall of Corregidor.  The full-length book was released several days later and became a huge bestseller (one reason so many used copies are available today).  \\"They Were Expendable\\" was one of the first pieces of World War II \\"hardcover journalism\\" to give firsthand accounts of the U.S. debacle in the Philippines, and it promised no-holds-barred revelations about how and why the United States could have been so badly beaten.  Some of what was \\"revealed\\" was myth -- tales of spies and sabotage, and exaggerations of Allied numerical inferiority to the Japanese.  Nor could White, even if he had wanted to, have gotten away with criticizing Douglas MacArthur or any Washington bigwigs who were in partresponsible for the Philippines disaster.  Indeed, MacArthur was still the hero of the hour for most Americans, and his association with the motor torpedo boats of Squadron 3 -- they spirited General, family and entourage away from Corregidor after President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to Australia in mid-March, 1942 -- helped hype the book immensely.<br />But what the book lacks in factual veracity, it makes up for in emotional sincerity.  Although White actually wrote the \\"monologues\\" that make up the narrative, he based his words on those of four squadron officers who had been ordered to leave the Philippines, to relay their knowledge of torpedo-boat warfare to new PT crews back in the States.  Their quiet professionalism comes through loud and clear.  Lt. John D. Bulkeley, squadron commander and winner of the Medal of Honor for his leadership aboard the boats, is featured prominently because he had already received a great deal of publicity early in 1942, thanks to MacArthur's press agents on Corregidor<br />But the heart of the narrative (most of it, actually) is attributed to the squadron exec, Lt. Robert Kelly (later transformed in the movie version into John Wayne's overgrown adolescent, \\"Rusty Ryan,\\" a portrayal that Kelly came to detest).  Kelly not only relates his part in the squadron's combats against the Japanese and MacArthur's departure from the islands, but also tells of his relationship with an Army nurse, \\"Peggy,\\" whom he met in a Corregidor hospital where he was being treated for a minor injury that turned major.  White likely overstated the depth of this relationship - it was really more friendship than romance - but Kelly's grief over the loss of that friendship became a metaphor (okay, stick with me here) for America's loss of the Philippines, and perhaps the loss of an innocent vision of the United States as an invincible military power.<br />After the war (and after the release, in 1945, of the John Ford film based on the book -- a very personal expression of Ford's own views about the war and the Navy), U.S. intelligence officers and historians discovered that the achievements of Squadron 3 in Philippine waters had been somewhat exaggerated.  Japanese ships that the torpedo boat crews claimed as \\"sunk\\" were, more often than not, undamaged.  (Yes, U.S. torpedoes used early in the war were very unreliable.)  As the Pacific war progressed, PT boats became extremely important as inshore gunboats (a role in which Squadron 3 excelled, too) but were employed only occasionally as torpedo platforms.<br />Despite the wartime inaccuracies, White's restrained writing captures the quiet pride as well as the sadness and frustration of his subjects, young men still grieving over losing their crews and their boats.  (About half the squadron personnel, listed at the end of the book, became POWs, and several did not survive the harsh Japanese captivity.)  I first read this book at age ten, and I have kept coming back to it for more than thirty years because it has an emotional impact unlike most wartime reportage I've read.  Although he covered the war in a different way, \\"They Were Expendable\\" puts White on a level alongside Ernie Pyle, with whom he shared the ability to see beyond surface heroics to the melancholy that afflicts all human beings caught up in combat.  (If you like \\"They Were Expendable,\\" find a copy of White's other great book about the early days of defeat in the Pacific war, \\"Queens Die Proudly.\\")<br />This is a classic of World War Two journalism -- again, not for the facts, but for the truth.  If you want a factual book on Squadron 3 at war, read the appropriate chapter in Robert J. Bulkley Jr.'s \\"At Close Quarters.\\"  For a book that plumbs the emotional experience of an American defeat, read \\"They Were Expendable.\\"	2004-05-31

It's only recent rival is the similarly titled three-volume series by William R. Trotter, published a quarter-century after Barrett's Civil War centennial-era book.<br /><br />As both Barrett and Trotter point out, North Carolina was a pre-war stronghold of southern Unionists and the last of the Confederate states to officially secede (five weeks after the Fort Sumter attack).  Almost overnight the state, especially the Piedmont and eastern regions, became a strong supporter of the secessionist cause.  About 125,000 North Carolinians served in the Confederate armed forces (while several thousand more, including African-Americans and many Appalachian whites, served the Union cause).  The state was a prime provider of food, clothing, and other supplies to Lee's Army of Northern Virginia (of which, in the last two years of the war, North Carolina regiments comprised as much as fifty percent).  Wilmington, North Carolina, was the last major Confederate port to be closed to blockade runners, in January 1865; and the railroad leading from Wilmington to Weldon, North Carolina (and from there to Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia), was arguably the most important transportation link in the Confederacy.<br /><br />The state is often overlooked as a site of Civil War battles, however, even though Union forces invaded the state as early as August, 1861 (five weeks after the war's first major battle near Manassas, Virginia).  Four years later, North Carolina was the site of the largest surrender of Confederate troops.  In between were several hundred battles and skirmishes, mostly in the eastern part of the state, some in the western mountains, and in the central Piedmont area in March and April of 1865 when William T. Sherman's Union army surged across the South Carolina line.<br /><br />The Union's 1862 coastal campaign in North Carolina was one of the most important military ventures of the entire war, yet among the least appreciated then or now.  Beginning in January, Union army and naval forces by June had taken control of North Carolina's \\"inner banks,\\" from Virginia south to present-day Morehead City.  Union setbacks in Virginia, however, led to the withdrawal of many federal soldiers from North Carolina, leaving only enough Union troops to effectively hold a few coastal strongpoints.  Greater Union pressure in North Carolina in 1862 - e.g., reinforcements to securely occupy Wilmington and Goldsboro (a vital railroad junction on the Wilmington-Weldon line) - might have created a major military and economic disaster for the Confederacy and shortened the war.  Instead, the remaining Union troops hunkered down in fortified coastal towns like New Bern, \\"little\\" Washington, and Plymouth until 1865,  venturing out now and then to raid and forage in the rich farmlands of eastern North Carolina. (Confederate forces retook Plymouth and Washington in 1864 but abandoned them again before the year was out.)<br /><br />The state's role in the last months of the war is better known.  The fall of Fort Fisher in January 1865 effectively closed Wilmington as a port, depriving Lee's slowly starving troops of a major supply source.  Sherman's forces entered the state on March 3, as other Union troops marched from New Bern and Wilmington to meet Sherman at Goldsboro.  Gen. Joseph E. Johnston led a vain Confederate effort to stop Sherman in the state's biggest battle, near Bentonville; Johnston then fell back on Raleigh and later to Greensboro.  From the Tennessee mountains, Gen. George Stoneman's Union cavalry division descended on the western half of North Carolina in late March and April.  Following the Confederate government's evacuation of Richmond on April 2, President Jefferson Davis spent several days in Greensboro, then convened his last official cabinet meeting in Charlotte on April 26 before fleeing south.  Johnston and Sherman met at the Bennett Farm, near Durham, on April 17-18 and again on April 26, negotiating the surrender of all remaining Confederate forces in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. (Skirmishing continued in the western mountains of the state until early May, however.)<br /><br />Barrett's work is more traditional and academic than Trotter's, with extensive endnotes and a valuable bibliographical essay, but the writing is generally clear and moves along well.  As one might expect from a North Carolinian of his generation, Barrett's tone is a bit pro-Confederate, but overall his assessment of battles and generalship is sound.  However, while the book is strong on the conventional military aspects, Barrett doesn't spend much space on the political and social issues of the war in North Carolina - e.g., the activities of pro-Union political factions, Gov. Zebulon P. Vance's conflicts with Jefferson Davis, or the role of the state's African-Americans in the war.  Barrett does devote some space to Confederate deserters and others who resisted serving the Confederacy, but he doesn't give a cohesive picture of North Carolina politics during the war.  However, he does do a better job than Trotter of relating military events in North Carolina to the battles and campaigns of the broader war.<br /><br />The book contains some contemporary illustrations, but the maps are few and poorly done.  (I would recommend a DeLorme \\"North Carolina Atlas and Gazetteer\\" as a vital supplement to this book; many of the Civil War era rights-of-way remain in use.)  Another minor complaint:  Some of the place names cited in the book (apparently from wartime records and accounts) have changed since the 1860s and no longer show up on modern maps, and descriptions of these locations in terms of modern landmarks would have been welcome.<br /><br />With the vast amount of research done on the Civil War in the past forty years, there's a crying need for a new, well-documented, one-volume account of the North Carolina's role in the war, one giving more attention to the political and social aspects without shortchanging the military accounts.  Until that book emerges, Barrett's account is a good starting point for learning about the war as it was fought in the Old North State.ing south.

US	20947016	RNMSEHBO4YSM3	1568370490	827808069	The Last 90 Days of the War	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Fascinating account of war's end	This review is based on the 1993 facsimile reprint, which includes a short introduction (by Diane Cobb Cashman) about Cornelia Phillips Spencer, as well as what appears to be an index that wasn't in the 1866 publication. If you can locate a copy of the original book in good shape, of course, you've got a very valuable treasure!  One hopes the reprint version might be re-released by Broadfoot, or picked up and distributed by another publisher (UNC Press, are you there?).<br />Spencer, the widowed daughter of a University of North Carolina faculty member, experienced the Civil War from what was then the village of Chapel Hill. She was well-acquainted with North Carolina's leading citizens, including Gov. Zebulon P. Vance and the president of the state university, former Gov. David Swain.  Using this personal access, and corresponding with other witnesses to the closing weeks of the war, she pieced together an engaging, if somewhat episodic, account of those final days of conflict. (After the war and publication of this book, Spencer took an active role in \\"reconstructing\\" the University of North Carolina.  She is widely celebrated for her efforts that helped reopen the university in 1875, but she also is condemned by some for her white-supremacist views, hardly uncommon in her era.)<br />\\"The Last Ninety Days of the Civil War in North Carolina\\" is not a work of history so much as it is reportage; indeed, the book was originally a series of articles published late in 1865 in a New York City periodical. It also lacks the objectivity that one associates with more modern history and journalism. Spencer deals with three major themes in the book: (1) the rapacious behavior of Union soldiers as they invaded her home state; (2) the efforts of state officials to end the fighting and destruction in April 1865; and (3) the strong support received by the Confederacy from a state that was, according to Spencer, strongly Unionist in its sentiment up until April 1861. (Most observers, including Spencer, hold that President Lincoln's appeal to North Carolina for troops to put down the rebellion in neighboring southern states turned most Tarheels against the Union. North Carolina was the last of the Confederate states to secede, on May 20, 1861, five weeks after the attack on Fort Sumter.)<br />Spencer's account is unabashedly opinionated:  She both vilifies and praises Gen. William T. Sherman, for the destructiveness of his Union troops and for his magnanimous peace terms in accepting the surrender of Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston. The numerous examples of Yankee theft, vandalism, arson, abusiveness, and occasional murders, as related by Spencer's correspondents, must be considered with some caution - emotions were still running high in the months after the war ended - yet the preponderance of evidence presented shows an appalling degree of bad behavior by Union troops, and not just the \\"bummers,\\" in March and April of 1865. (This includes also the large Union cavalry force, under Gen. George Stoneman, that invaded North Carolina from the west and penetrated as far east and south as Greensboro and Charlotte.) Sherman's troops, who had inflicted considerable damage on public and private property in South Carolina as they marched northward that spring, had been instructed by their general to go easy on North Carolina, as that state had presumably been a reluctant participant in the Southern rebellion. The Union soldiers may have been incensed with the high degree of Confederate sympathy they encountered in the southern Piedmont of the state; certainly, the accounts Spencer presents argue that the Union troops did not spare North Carolinians the terrors of Sherman's \\"fear and dread\\" mode of warfare.<br />Spencer's book is particularly valuable for her account of efforts by Vance, Swain, and others to reduce the destruction and end the fighting in their state. Swain, with Vance's permission, led a delegation to intercept Sherman as he approached Raleigh, North Carolina, in hope of sparing the capital city and state facilities the destruction that had been visited on South Carolina's capital, Columbia. Sherman was merciful, and while his troops still stripped the countryside of food and valuables, the wanton destruction of homes, businesses, and public buildings was largely ended. Four days after taking Raleigh, Sherman met with Johnston at the Bennett Farm, near Durham, to arrange for the surrender of Johnston's army and the end of effective Confederate resistance.<br />Although some of Spencer's concerns (e.g., a couple of chapters and appendices about the effect of the war on her beloved University of North Carolina) will be of limited interest to most Civil War buffs, this is not a merely provincial account. It presents an unabashedly pro-Southern view of efforts to bring the war's destructiveness to an end. The most interesting aspect of this book, however, is what is NOT stated by Spencer: namely, the irony of North Carolina's sacrifices in defending a cause that, by Spencer's own acknowledgment, most of the state did not, at heart, support. Throughout the book she repeatedly expresses pride in North Carolina's support of the Confederacy; but she also writes, \\"I repeat, that from the first the great body of her people and the best and most clear-sighted of her public men deprecated the whole business of secession, and with sad prevision foretold the result.\\" One is left to wonder how much shorter and less destructive the entire Civil War might have been had North Carolina's Unionists prevailed in May of 1861.	2004-05-26

But one can't get a good understanding of the war in the Tarheel State just reading about a single region. I strongly suggest that serious students of the war, or of North Carolina, take time to read the entire trilogy.    Aside from John G. Barrett's \\"The Civil War in North Carolina,\\" Trotter's trilogy is the only modern comprehensive account of the war in the Tar Heel state. (See also my review of Barrett's book at Amazon.com.) Unlike Barrett's rather academic, formal approach, Trotter is as concerned with telling some good stories as he is with documenting North Carolina's role in the war. He includes a fairly extensive bibliography in each volume, but apparently he relied mainly on published sources, and the footnotes are very sparse. This is not to say that his work is inaccurate or invalid, but it is hardly the ultimate account of the war in North Carolina.    His geographical division of the three volumes also presents some problems.  Much information about the state's entry into the war and about its political aspects is found in \\"Silk Flags and Cold Steel,\\" but the most important battles in the first three years of the war -- which had an influence on these political events -- are covered in the \\"Ironclads and Columbiads\\" volume about the coastal war.  These two volumes also contain many later events that \\"interact,\\" for example, the closing battles in March and April of 1865. And some events in \\"Bushwhackers\\" - most notably, Stoneman's cavalry raid in the final weeks of the war - also lap over into the Piedmont. Again, a full understanding requires reading all three of these books. Trotter, while adopting a mildly pro-Confederate tone like Barrett's, doesn't do as good a job of tying events in North Carolina to those of the wider war.    \\"Silk Flags and Cold Steel\\" contains the most information about North Carolina politics and the reasons for the state's reluctant secession in May 1861.  Since there was little fighting in the Piedmont region of the state until the closing months of the war, most of the book deals with the war's impact on the economy, the relationship between the state and Confederate governments, and the roles of certain groups, including African-Americans, in the war. The latter part of the book covers Sherman's invasion of the state in March 1865, the battles of Averasboro and Bentonville, the surrender of Raleigh and the final surrender of Confederate forces in the state at Bennett Farm, near Durham.    One failing that Trotter shares with Barrett is the poor quality of his maps and the lack of description of battle sites, roads, and other places in modern terms. A copy of DeLorme's \\"North Carolina Atlas and Gazetteer\\" is a vital supplement to these three books; modern place names and locations of battles and other events should have been located using modern landmarks, included as footnotes.    Trotter's trilogy is \\"popular\\" history, entertainingly related and highly readable.  He doesn't hesitate to have occasional fun with purple prose -- \\"The obsidian mountain night engulfed them like wraiths\\" -- but the writing usually is lively and flows well.  There may be more recent and more thorough books about various aspects of the Civil War in North Carolina, but these three volumes present an introductory survey in a convenient package.	2004-05-26

Much of \\"Bushwhackers\\" focuses on Thomas's North Carolina Highland Legion, a unit made up partly of Cherokee Indians, which fought throughout the war and gained a fearsome reputation in the Great Smokies area.  Trotter also spends much space here on Confederate deserters and draft dodgers who flocked to the mountains to hide out (shades of \\"Cold Mountain!\\"). (In his other volumes, Trotter also devotes ample time to draft resisters and Unionist guerrillas in the Piedmont and Chowan River regions.) However, his account of the war in the mountains is more episodic and less cohesive than the accounts of the other two books, perhaps because the North Carolina mountain war was more diverse and source materials about it rather scarce and sometimes apocryphal.      One failing that Trotter shares with Barrett is the poor quality of his maps (\\"Bushwhackers\\" has no maps at all!) and the lack of description of battle sites, roads, and other places in modern terms. It took me a while to figure out that the town known in 1861 as \\"Warm Springs,\\" on the French Broad River, is named \\"Hot Springs\\" on modern maps; and I never did figure out if \\"Quallatown\\" is the same place as the present-day Cherokee, North Carolina. (If not, it must be very close by.) A copy of DeLorme's \\"North Carolina Atlas and Gazetteer\\" is a vital supplement to these three books; modern place names and locations of battles and other events should have been located using modern landmarks, included as footnotes.    Trotter's trilogy is \\"popular\\" history, entertainingly related and highly readable. He doesn't hesitate to have occasional fun with purple prose- \\"The obsidian mountain night engulfed them like wraiths\\" -but the writing usually is lively and flows well.  There may be more recent and more thorough books about various aspects of the Civil War in North Carolina, but Trotter's trilogy presents an introductory survey in a convenient package.	2004-05-26

But one can't get a good understanding of the Civil War in North Carolina by reading only about a single region. I strongly suggest that serious students of the war, or of North Carolina, take time to read the entire trilogy.    Aside from John G. Barrett's \\"The Civil War in North Carolina,\\" Trotter's trilogy is the only modern comprehensive account of the war in the Tar Heel state. (See also my review of Barrett's book at Amazon.com.) Unlike Barrett's rather academic, formal approach, Trotter is as concerned with telling some good stories as he is with documenting North Carolina's role in the war.  He includes a fairly extensive bibliography in each volume, but apparently he relied mainly on published sources, and the footnotes are very sparse. This is not to say that his work is inaccurate or invalid, but it is hardly the ultimate account of the war in North Carolina.    His geographical division of the three volumes also presents some problems. Much information about the state's entry into the war and about its poltical aspects is found in the volume on the Piedmont, \\"Silk Flags and Cold Steel,\\" but the most important battles in the first three years of the war -- which had an influence on these political events -- are covered in \\"Ironclads and Columbiads.\\" These two volumes also contain many later events that \\"interact,\\" for example, the closing battles in March and April of 1865. And some events in \\"Bushwhackers\\" - most notably, Stoneman's cavalry raid in the final weeks of the war - also lap over into Piedmont. Again, a full understanding requires reading all three of these books. Trotter, while adopting a mildly pro-Confederate tone like Barrett's, doesn't do as good a job of tying events in North Carolina to those of the wider war.    \\"Ironclads and Columbiads\\" covers the most important battles in the state. In January 1862, Union forces began in earnest to occupy crucial points on the North Carolina coast. Within six months, Union army and naval forces effectively controlled coastal North Carolina from the Virginia line south to present-day Morehead City. Union setbacks in Virginia, however, led to the withdrawal of many federal soldiers from North Carolina, leaving only enough Union troops to hold coastal strongpoints like New Bern, \\"little\\" Washington, and Plymouth.  Had the Union pressed harder in North Carolina in 1862 - e.g., reinforcing their units there and occupying Wilmington and Goldsboro (a vital railroad junction on the Wilmington-Weldon line) - the armies of the Confederacy might have been stretched much thinner than they were by the ineffective Union campaigns against Richmond, and may well have lost their principal port.  Union control of eastern North Carolina would have been a major military and economic disaster for the Confederacy. Instead, the Union forces on the coast had to remain in fortified garrisons until 1865, occasionally venturing out to raid and forage in the rich farmlands of eastern North Carolina. Confederate forces retook Plymouth and Washington in 1864 but lost them again before the year was out.    One failing that Trotter shares with Barrett is the poor quality of his maps and the lack of description of battle sites, roads, and other places in modern terms. A copy of DeLorme's \\"North Carolina Atlas and Gazetteer\\" is a vital supplement to these three books; modern place names and locations of battles and other events should have been located using modern landmarks, included as footnotes.

US	20947016	RNNE828Q3WRCV	037540287X	297671974	Raised on Radio	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Good starting point for casual readers on "Old Time Radio"	This review is based on the hardcover version.    This is neither a formal history of American radio's \\"Golden Age\\" (c.1928-1950), nor is it a book likely to please every \\"Old Time Radio\\" fanatic who wants elaborately detailed accounts of his favorite programs and performers.  Gerald Nachman came of age in the waning days of bigtime network radio; he fondly remembers the medium; and he tries to convey some of his warm regard (dare one call it \\"nostalgia?\\") for the people and broadcasts that have most impressed him.  For those who were not \\"raised on radio\\" (or, more likely, grew up in the later decades of disc jockeys and \\"talk\\"), the book provides an introduction to the basics of Old Time Radio.    Nachman affectionately hits the high points with chapters on Jack Benny, Fred Allen, and Bob Hope, a paean to the ultimate radio soap opera, \\"One Man's Family,\\" and insightful analyses of such cultural icons as Walter Winchell, the Quiz Kids, Burns and Allen, Arthur Godfrey, and others who made a medium that (along with the movies) dominated American popular culture in the 1930s and 1940s.  His assessment of the \\"Amos `n' Andy\\" controversy - should African-Americans be offended or flattered by two well-meaning white comedians in aural blackface? - is on the mark.  On the other hand, Nachman doesn't put enough emphasis on Orson Welle's 1938 \\"War of the Worlds\\" broadcast, which demonstrated the power of radio to scare the hell out of casual listeners; but there are numerous other books on that phenomenon.  One also can quibble that there's not a chapter about commercial radio's efforts to popularize \\"high culture\\" - e.g., Arturo Toscanini, Sigmund Spaeth, the Metropolitan Opera - although Nachman does mention them in passing.  Most of the chapters are devoted to specific entertainment genres - soap operas, kids' shows, dramatic series and serials, quiz programs, musical/variety shows, westerns, etc. - and cover major performers and programs in each.    As one might expect,Nachman bemoans the demise of \\"live\\" network radio in the 1950s and 1960s, as Americans turned from prime-time listening to prime-time viewing.  If the book has a major failing, it's a lack of information about and understanding of American radio audiences and why they largely abandoned network radio for television.  A chapter on audiences and the radio ratings systems might have been appropriate - but, again, this is not a history so much as an \\"appreciation.\\"    Nachman cites several interviews and includes a long list of books he apparently consulted for his own work; but since there are no footnotes, it's difficult for a non-specialist to judge if there are as many factual errors here as other reviewers claim.  (By the way, Adlai Stevenson WAS a presidential contender in 1960, at least until John F. Kennedy locked up the Democratic nomination; but there was no primary \\"election night\\" prior to Winchell's departure from network radio that year, so he couldn't have made his on-air comment, comparing Stevenson with Christine Jorgenson, quite as Nachman relates it.)    Still, Nachman writes in a lively, easy-flowing style; his chapters are well-organized and self-contained, short enough for casual reading.  All in all, \\"Raised on Radio\\" is a good introduction for younger readers (born after 1960, shall we say) to the basics of Old Time Radio, a good place to get one's bearings before tackling more specialized books and, of course, listening to the programs themselves.	2004-05-25
US	20947016	R3SLZDYMYGUP5F	0792241037	877597761	Storm of the Century: The Labor Day Hurricane of 1935	Books	3	14	16	N	N	Popular history with some flaws	I grew up in South Florida and spent many weekends on Lower Matecumbe Key, ground zero for the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane. I went through Hurricane Donna and a few others in the early 1960s, and I don't care to do that again -- another reason why the 1935 disaster has long fascinated me. It is a story of heartbreaking human miscalculation in the face of an overwhelming natural event.    Drye writes well and moves the narrative along.  When writing of factual matters and the experiences of those who endured the storm, the books succeeds pretty well. However, he buys into some of the political mythology surrounding the events of the storm -- e.g., that World War I veterans were sent to the Florida Keys by officials of Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration to prevent them from re-staging the 1932 \\"Bonus March\\" that gave such a black eye to Herbert Hoover.  As Drye notes, vets also were sent to other locations, their activities were still followed by the national media, and their absence from Washington didn't stop other veterans from pressing for payment of the bonus.  Sending out-of-work veterans to the Florida Keys as a labor force for highway construction can also be interpreted as an act of New Deal good intentions -- perhaps shortsighted but hardly malicious.    The actions of federal and state officials in the hours before the hurricane struck also are open to some interpretation, but Drye chooses to create villains and heroes -- in particular, Ray Sheldon, the man who managed the three labor camps that housed the veterans.  No doubt, Sheldon was largely responsible for failing to arrange the evacuation of the vets well before the storm struck. The more intriguing question, which really isn't addressed in the book, is WHY Sheldon -- who had experienced earlier Florida hurricanes -- didn't order an evacuation train until the storm was almost upon the Keys. Was it pure miscalculation, denial, or was there some bureaucratic purpose in his delay?  Here, some informedspeculation would have been welcome. Drye doesn't really address the question; he simply portrays Sheldon as indecisive and, post-hurricane, a liar. These he may have been but such a portrayal doesn't get much below the surface of the issue.    This leads to the most glaring deficiency in Drye's work: His book is devoid of footnotes, and the origin of much of his narrative is obscure. (To be fair, the decision to omit footnotes and a comprehensive bibliography may have been the publisher's, not Drye's.) He does acknowledge assistance from several people and lists a \\"selected bibliography,\\" both of which indicate some of his sources of information; but he doesn't list any of the National Archives resources or other official documents he must have consulted, nor their locations. Nor does he give sources for certain opinionated passages, such as his explanation of how the chairman of the congressional inquiry into the Labor Day disaster rigged the hearings to exonerate Roosevelt's officials.  This is a major failing of what should have been a much more useful study of this event.  The book also could have used a more comprehensive index and perhaps a \\"cast of characters\\" that would provide a convenient reference to the dozens of people mentioned, especially the myriad of bureaucrats. And, particularly for demonstrating the degree of miscalculation and faulty judgment involved in this disaster, a timeline of events also would have been welcomed.    Stories about natural disasters can be approached in essentially three ways: (1) Bravery/survival in the face of adversity, (2) Managerial competence and ineptitude in the face of adversity, and (3) A cautionary tale for the future. Drye does all three,  succeeding fairly well on (1), stumbling somewhat on (2), succeeding commendably on (3). If you're a relatively new resident to South Florida (especially the Keys) or know someone who's planning to move there -- of if you think riding out the eye of a hurricane would be a \\"neat\\" experience -- this book, with all its flaws, is worth a read.  One of the contemporary emergency management officials for the Florida Keys, quoted by Drye, hits it on the head regarding the next big Keys hurricane: \\"It's not if. It's when.\\"  Hurricane Andrew, another \\"rapidly intensifying\\" storm, devastated my home town of Homestead in 1992; had the eye made landfall twenty miles further north, it would have flattened Miami.  Hurricanes are the price one pays for living along the south Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and anyone contemplating residence and property ownership in those regions should know what happened on Upper and Lower Matecumbe Keys on the evening of Sept. 2, 1935. This book is a good place to start learning how high that price can be. (...)	2004-04-05
US	20947016	R32X51FL7UHGCY	0471089702	5974524	The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori	Books	3	29	37	N	N	Scholarly excellence, but lacking in context	Like many who will approach this book, I sought out Ravina's \\"The Last Samurai\\" as a corrective to the 2003 Edward Zwick film of the same title. As has been said elsewhere, it's deemed less politically correct in Hollywood to make a movie about a Japanese Robert E. Lee -- an American whose career is   somewhat analagous to that of Saigo Takamori -- than a Japanese Sitting Bull.  Ravina's extensively researched account strips away the romance from Saigo's life and presents it in a well-written and unemotional account.    Unfortunately, people such as myself -- American history buffs with only a rudimentary knowledge of Japanese history and,   especially, the political struggles during the transformation of 19th-century Japan from a feudal society to a modern nation with ambitions of world power -- are going to find \\"The Last Samurai\\" rough going. There is a good deal of information in the book about the people and events that shaped Saigo's career, but Ravina seems to assume that the reader will be well-acquainted with some of the basic aspects of Japanese history -- the establishment and development of the shogunate, the relationship between the shoguns and the imperial dynasty and court, the relationships among the various daimyos, or feudal domains -- and provides inadquate context for the uninformed reader. I would advise any potential reader not already thus informed to read at least one expansive, general account of 19th-century Japanese history before delving into the life of Saigo. Such foreknowledge will make Ravina's book a far more rewarding experience. The book contains some decent maps and illustrations, but the maps could have been more inclusive, to show all the feudal domains of mid-19th-century Japan. (A map listing in the contents page also would have been welcome). And as another reviewer suggests, a biographical \\"cast of characters\\" who figure prominently in the book would be useful. Maybe it's just me, but some of the Japanese names and titles were hard to keep separate in my mind.    In summary: This is not a \\"popular\\" biography and does not conform to stereotypical Western images of the samurai gleaned from a half-century of movies. It's an enlightening book for specialists or for others who have prepared themselves for a study of 19th-century Japan.	2004-02-16
