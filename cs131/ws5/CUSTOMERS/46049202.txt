I live in paradise and, at anytime, can sit on my deck and gaze out over the lake, listen to wind whistling through the trees, or admire the millions of stars overhead. I can walk through the woods, sit and watch birds and animals, admire the trout attempting to climb up the creek to spawn, and glean inspiration and rejuvenation from my environment on a daily basis. However not everyone has the options I do. Judy Reeves has found a way to assist any writer, living anywhere. This kit helps you to connect with your muse while teaching how to create a retreat right where you are.<br /><br />\\"The Writer's Retreat Kit\\" by Judy Reeves is a gem. The attractive kit includes a book and a deck of cards. The prose in the book takes you on a gentle and innovative cruise. Your passage through a variety of expeditions teaches you alternatives to \\"traditional\\" retreats. Each theme offers four options and suggestions for additional nourishment. The work also provides exercises along with ideas for starting and ending ceremonies. The cards can be pulled for inspiration or direction, too. The combinations are endless.<br /><br />Judy Reeves is a talented author who is a muse to writers all over the globe. In addition to contributing great and innovative programs for the writing community in San Diego, Judy was one of the first guest speakers and authors hosted by my Alliance of Writers. She blessed me by writing about the group in her, \\"Writing Along, Writing Together.\\"<br /><br />If you need a gift for a writer--or are a writer looking for something innovative and fresh--this is a winner!	2005-04-29

Books	5	3	4	N	N	Compact, Clever and A Comprehensive Overview	\\"Some Writers Deserve to Starve\\" by Elaura Niles is a must for any writer's bookcase. (I have mine inserted between a few other amusing titles.) The title made me laugh and succeeded in getting me to take it off the shelf. This turned out to be a great strategy since the book is small and was amidst hundreds of other titles at a big book superstore.<br /><br />When I actually got into the book, I found it to be a humorous and cut-to-the-chase handbook. As I read, I flashed back on my writing groups, on literary events I've sponsored, and on experiences I've had. Many novice writers contact me and I seem to repeat the same things over and over again. Now I can just hand those aspiring scribes this book!<br /><br />Compact and clever, this is a quick read--but don't be fooled, it is also a comprehensive overview. Get it if you want to know the real story. Also, it will make for a great conversation starter when you have those literary types lurking around your bookcases during social events.	2005-04-29

Released earlier this year, the Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior had to be a daunting task to put together. The three volumes provide an introductory overview on various behavior topics. I don't envy the editor (Marc Bekoff) who bravely tackled the task.<br /><br />Anyone interested in animal related topics will find this three volume set useful. The up-to-date information contains contributions from many experts in a variety of fields. Entries include submissions from disciplines such as entomology, psychology, biology, veterinary medicine, behavior and others.<br /><br />One major difference is that it includes dialog regarding animal emotions, awareness, consciousness and empathy. These have been taboo topics in the past.<br /><br />The other nice aspect of this work is the wide range of material it introduces. Regular behavior topics such as social organization, behavior patterns, animals as individuals and species, domestic and wild animals, and other related subjects such as careers are included.<br /><br />The book is user friendly with reasonably sized articles, short sidebars and provocative essays.	2005-03-20

Ken Follett has created an entertaining collection of characters is this spy thriller and added a hint of romance. The competition between spies involves a combination of Egyptian, Israeli, and Russians whose path crossed at Oxford!<br /><br />I spent time doing the audio (unabridged edition) and enjoyed most of it. However the accent of Dickstein sounded more Australian to me and parts literally put me to sleep!<br /><br />Overall it was engaging. Not at the top of my list but definately worth reading it you like spy stories with great characters.	2004-09-14

DeMille provides an interesting cast of characters with careful detail to setting. The climax comes within the walls of the \\"charm school\\" (where Russians are taught to imitate Americans). Although this is not my normal genre of reading, I found this novel to be a great choice and know that it will keep your interest.	2004-09-14

This was my first Anne Perry novel (audio abridgment). I found it to be entertaining and it moved along quite well.<br /><br />William Monk is one of Perry's regular characters. Set in Victorian England there is a cast of characters with passionate beliefs and different motivations. I suspected one to be the evil antagonist--but discovered it was not him as the story progressed. (All the clues are not available within an abridgment.)<br /><br />There were a few interesting twists...and the break from the underwater sequence with Monk kept me on edge.<br /><br />In the book you embark on a voyage to America coinciding with the beginning of the American Civil War. Hester and William Monk travel by boat on a mission to bring back the run-away daughter of Albertson. Meritt's confused passion for the abolishment of slavery is exhibited as a romantic crush for Lyman...a Northerner bent on purchasing guns from her father-- despite Albertson's continued refusal to sell them to him. Albertson's murder just happens to concide with the gun delivery to Lyman.<br /><br />The return to England takes you through the trial and the revelation of what actually happens after both Lyman and Meritt are acquitted of wrong doing.<br /><br />This engaging work will put Anne Perry on my list of authors to explore further.	2004-09-14

This Irish author presents an interesting weave of characters and fashions a fine tapestry of lives that cover the spectrum: Character ego, courage, depression, deceit, infidelity, and loyal friendships make this an interesting book. The text does build into adult content and language.<br /><br />The book is filled with Irish/Brit wit and flair. You'll enter the fashion magazine world and find some fine female characters along with the drama and growth that accompanies the human condition and any type of relationship.<br /><br />Recommended.	2004-09-06

The main character, Odd Thomas is an ordinary young adult who works as a fry cook. However, he is also clairvoyant and clairaudient--which means he can see and hear the deceased and other entities.<br /><br />Only a few people know about his gifts and his work helping local law enforcement. However, when he catches a glimpse of the dark bodachs (who usually are only around for violent episodes) the adventure begins.<br /><br />The engaging story will keep you hooked. You might not like the ending for this hero but you will definately enjoy the read!<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended.	2004-09-06

Lauren experiences the stark contrast between the large family craziness and Lauren's home life as she struggles to achieve her academic goals and learns that she can determine her own fate.<br /><br />Laruen's unexpected pregnancy takes her on a path where she faces her fears, her past, and discovers herself, truth, and true friendship.

When Koontz mentioned (at the LA Festival of Books) that his next book was set in my home area (San Bernardino Mountains) I was interested in reading it. He is a great writer and I loved \\"Odd Thomas.\\" However, other than the great beginning, \\"The Taking\\" was difficult for me to get through.<br /><br />I am not into the horror genre (or much science fiction) so the trek into the invasion by aliens and the resulting events didn't work for me.	2004-09-06

The video game seems harmless enough, but when crimes begin to mirror the serial killer cop test game put online--things heat up!

I savored the pace and the artistry of the weave.<br />Kingsolver takes you on a journey of the senses, explores the interconnectedness, and the choices found in simple life. Each of the three story lines are interconnected--you discover the threads slowly.<br />Having lived in a farm community and on the edge of the wilderness, I have encountered many of the characters and topics found in this book--I found it beautifully done.<br />Definately worth your time, but it is a nature walk through the forest not a trot down the path in the middle. So, if you are looking for popular fiction or entertainment read something like Evanovich, if you want to delve into an artful weave rich in description but without intense complications--then pick up this book.	2004-02-24

In this tale, a modern day writer discovers her mothers journal and has it translated. The story shifts from present day to the past of the mother, and then back to the present.<br />Although I found parts of the book interesting, it consistently failed to hold my interest. I'd rather invest my time into something that grabs me. Do I have any specifics to illustrate why? I understood some of the metaphors and symbols, and I also understand that some of the content reflects the author's life, but I think I've found fuller descriptions and illustrations of life in other cultures elsewhere--maybe I just don't relate to this one.	2004-02-24

Other reviews get into the story, so I won't. Basically, the underlying message is that you never know the full picture nor do you know your influence--or that of others.<br />The message is hidden in an interesting story that spans the long years of one life and you will want to make sure you have the tissues handy when you read about this one.

It starts with a teenage boy's quest for a connection to the divine. He is considered an oddity as he is a practicing Christian, Muslim and Hindu (all at once). The story gets interesting when this zoo director's son escapes a sinking ship and finds himself in a lifeboat shared by an orangutan, a hyena and a tiger.<br />Pi and the tiger co-habitate in the small lifeboat for seven and a half months. When finally landing on the coast of Mexico, Pi gives two explanations for his amazing survival. You, the reader, must decide which is truth.<br />A great tapistry of thought, insight, adaptability in adversity, and story telling.	2004-01-30

Davis adapts a Japanese accent with a perfect theatrical presentation.<br />This story is about a young peasant girl who became a popular geisha and the journey there (pre and post WWII). The book is filled with hints of petty jeolousies, plots to influence, and a cast of characters who leave you eager to hear the next events. The story seduces you through Chiyo's maturity into the popular geisha Sayuri--and I found myself rooting for her during her quest for her heart's desire. This was an interesting glimpse into the world of the geisha.	2004-01-30

(Audio)	This was my first experience with Stephen White and it was an enjoyable one. There are many plot twists and this mystery thriller was a fun adventure. It made me enjoy the drive and rant and rave aloud about some of the characters' choices.<br />The story weaves around an FBI agent female who is responsible for getting a death row inmate out, a shrink who is professionally involved with both the agent and ex-inmate, and a cast of characters that add confusion, passion, and bizarre motivations and twists into the plot.<br />You'll be surprized at the end, but the story will definately keep you interested. I have not read this author before and give it a four star only because I think the motivation for the murder was a weak one and that the ending could have come earlier...but it still was/is a fun and interesting story.	2004-01-28

Since then I've read them all and you should too!<br />The series can be savored without worrying about reading in order, but I've enjoyed the tiny threads woven through each book even more by going back and reading from the beginning.<br />Stephanie, a bounty hunter by default, is zany and witty. Her cast of characters includes a grandmother who loves to go to viewings of the recently deceased, an on-again-off-again boyfriend who is a cop, a sexy bad-a** bounty hunter(sometimes partner)named Ranger and his cast of merry men. (The mutual attraction between Stephanie and Ranger creates some interesting heat.)<br />Through this series you'll meet her family, friends, and co-workers--and entertaining fugitives--all in technicolor vibrance.<br />Don't miss this one!	2004-01-28

It presents emotional themes such as compassion, loyalty, grief, and others, while giving animal examples and then asking questions. Although there are examples of animals choosing the opposite responses to those presented (gorillas in captivity have attacked people, etc.) the book is a good tool for sparking dialog and breaking through the old concept that animals don't have emotions.	2002-12-30

Copyright © 2002 By Diana Guerrero<br />This was my first glimpse at the writing of Sandra Brown and boy was it a spectacular experience! The book is written in a couple of voices and begins with a prologue that immediately captures you and beckons you to continue the journey.<br />Envy indeed includes \\"a book within a book.\\" The prologue the reader first encounters is actually a submission to publisher/editor Maris Matherly-Reed. It is intended to hook her and reel her in to the author, who intends to use her in a larger scheme. It hooked me just as strongly!<br />Corruption, greed, infidelity, passion and intrigue are just some of the tidbits you'll find in BOTH storylines. The outcome? It will surprise you _and_ satisfy you.<br />Fabulously done.	2002-12-02

The story begins with an ominous knock on the door in the wee hours of the morning. The reader learns of the plane crash and subsequent loss of the pilot Jack Lyons, and then gets involved in the drama surrounding the circumstances of the loss. As things unfold they get ugly, but Kathryn resolves them in a way that works for her.<br />I don't always care for the Oprah selections as some are very dark, but this one was a find. But don't take my opinion, read it for yourself!	2002-12-02

The story involves a woman having a bit of a mid-life crisis. At the encouragement of her shrink, who also owns the summerhouse, she reconnects with women from her past and they meet.<br />In an interesting twist, they get the opportunity to time travel back (individually) to relive three weeks from any period in their pasts. When they return, each may choose to accept any changes they may have made and go forward, or keep things the same. They also can choose to remember or forget. Each woman embarks on her own journey of discovery and the outcomes, well you will just have to read the book!<br />I was so impressed with this read I immediately went out to read another Deveraux novel. I didn't find it as impressive as this one. If you want a good read I can recommend \\"The Summerhouse.\\"	2002-12-02

The wizard cast his spell and caught me. Lee Fõdi will capture you too with his fabulous fairytale, Corranda&#146;s Crown.<br />The spell of enchantment of Corranda&#146;s Crown was cast upon me from the moment I glimpsed the cover. This book is masterfully written and strikingly illustrated. It drew me in and kept me captive until I had read it from cover to cover. Young or old will delight in this fairy tale set in the mythical kingdom of Kendar.<br />The infant princess Corranda is just barely whisked away from the grasp of the evil sorceress Odjin. As Corranda grows into a young woman, her inner beauty and fortitude keep her safe on a journey filled with risks in the quest to save her dear &#147;Uncle,&#148; Rollick the Dwarf. Able to communicate with animals, Corranda is assisted by her animal friends, Orufoo the fox (whose jokes make everyone groan), Kapoora the otter, Shutakee the crow, and others. Corranda faces many challenges, climaxing in a direct confrontation with the evil sorceress.<br />Fõdi&#146;s charming tale is sure to capture the same audience that has delighted in JRR Tolkein and JK Rowling. If you are looking for a good read that is fun and imparts some good lessons including those about kindness, and the magic of nature, then look no further. Buy it today!	2002-11-10

This book is a fabulous read for any age. Contained within you will find the funny and frank commentary of the young Rachel Sa.<br />Determined to have a writing career, this young teen (now young woman) worked her way onto the pages of The Toronto Sun. This is a collection of some of those columns written in her clear and refreshing voice. Nothing is taboo, so the topics range from family, friends, sex, work and more. I especially loved the letters and commentary that were included.<br />If you want to glimpse the teen perspective, open a window to understanding or to dialoging with a younger person, than be sure to give this book a gander.	2002-08-14

Okay, this is a winner! If you do NOT have it on your bookshelf then get it! This has become one of the required textbooks for many of my courses. (Visit my Amazon page for more information.)<br /><br />It is flat out beautiful -- the beauty is that it is filled with the illustrations and notes by the authors. The book delves into the questions you might have, doubts that might arise -- and those get answered but the book allows and encourages creativity and growth through the nature journal process.<br /><br />You'll find hints for what tools to pick for your illustrations and notes, tips for observing, what information you might want to include, how to overcome your critical mind, beginning drawing exercises and tips on how to enchance your creativity. You'll find a seasonal section that gives some good suggestions for documenting natural changes and events. Later there are more drawing exercises on shading, drawing flowers, anatomy, landscapes, etc. There are also samples of different journal techniques, tips on how to set up a nature study, how to keep records, how to journal for a scientific study or biological research project and still more!<br /><br />Toward the end of the book group journaling and exploring is discussed. What you will also find are valuable tips for quizzes, writing, science, art, history, music and math projects.

In this delightful little book a young child has the opportunity to learn what to expect on the first day of school. The book encourages question asking and answering, encourages activities that can be done during the reading and allows a child to glean useful tidbits about preparing for school and what might happen once there.<br /><br />Manners discussed include crossing the street, riding on the bus and listening to the teacher. Other discussions include how to find the class and desk, what might be learned, how some things might be easy while others might take more time, recess and playtime, lunch, bathroom breaks and more!<br /><br />BEAUTIFULLY illustrated with an appealing and expressive kangaroo.

Native American's know that everything has a song -- I only wish that Dana Lyons had included the actual notes within ...<br /><br />What is included are rich illustrations and some valuable teaching information. Julia Butterfly Hill (Legacy of Luna) has written one of the forewords and the author has included his personal story of THE TREE in the back. It is there that you will also find some information about the Pacific Rain Forest.<br /><br />Proceeds from the book go to the Jane Goodall Insitute and the Circle of Life Foundation. (You can find them on the web or via the book) Readers are also encouraged to find all the species that have been included within the illustrations from a short list at the end. If you have a kid that is constantly up in the branches (like I was) or are interested in teaching your kids about the value of a tree or conservation then this book would be one of the places you might start.	2002-06-15

Readers are incorporated into a journey into the rainforest where they learn about preparations for the trip, human activities and life in the area, rainfall, life in the different areas of the rainforest, terms, adaptations of plants and animals and more.<br /><br />This book is a good introduction for younger readers and is a refreshing change from some of the other works that outline specific areas of the rainforest (like the layers) and rant and rave about loss of biodiversity.<br /><br />Although the book touches on the important points it provides a good introductory overview and introduces words, concepts, plants and animals for further research.<br /><br />The ending leaves room for futher adventures in a sequel -- or for the teacher to explore with the class. I found this book when looking for texts for a more advanced workshop that I teach. I would recommend it as part of a rainforest curriculum package.	2002-06-15

This one is on party etiquette for young kids. Fun and silly illustrations get the point across as elephant gets ready to go to her first party.<br />The book starts with elephant's friend asking if she can bring a guest to Brenda's birthday party. When she gets the okay the preparations begin! Next there are many questions and answer opportunities regarding the proper attire to wear and what sort of gift to bring.<br /><br />Some of the topics discussed include: How to get ready for the party and what type of manners you should exhibit when you bring a guest (stay close, introduce your friend and say something pleasant about your friend) and tongue-in-cheek discussions of how you should behave when introduced to the adults, if you break something, swing on the drapes and other wild animal behavior!<br /><br />Taking turns, sharing, not being greedy, leaving pets alone, not snooping, washing hands after you use the toilet and saying Thank You are some of the other important points covered. The book even discusses that your gift stays with the birthday person!<br /><br />The illustrations of elephant are charming with her apprehensive and excited looks -- and her pink bow worn especially for the party. A great read for small kids.  Teaches manners and what to expect at a party.	2002-06-15

If you want your child to have fun learning about sea animals then this is a must read. The book has beautiful photographs and fun drawings. The name of each character has roots in animal classification (which I thought was a very clever learning tool) and the story conveys important facts about the animal life contained within.<br />The story was fun and educational. These animal adventurers are sure to be off on another adventure soon based on the ending. The only weakenss I found was that the book was a bit anthropomorphic for me but kids will love it. As an animal professional, the specific parts I had trouble with were the humans (biologists) feeding the otters in the wild (not a good idea) and the part where the otters ride the orca on his back (transient orcas eat mammals).<br />The big plus of this book, beyond the breath taking photos, is that the author included clever learning aids in the activity section. If you are an educator or homeschooler you will love it! Inside is a hidden word challenge, a word scramble, a crossword puzzle, questions, a memory game, a sleuth activity, a glossary and classification section and more. Don't worry, an answer key is included!	2002-05-14

The Soul Cafe takes you on a journey that will remind you to \\"wake up and smell the coffee\\". Will Ian sell his soul or find it? This book takes you on the personal journey of a man faced with chosing integrity, accountability or selling out. In the process he finds his spiritual center and remembers what is important.

The book conveys lessons of life and truths that hold true today....that somehow often get overlooked or taken forgranted.<br />Spirituality, extrasensory perception, honoring others (including plants and animals), loving one another are some of the topics you will find.	2001-10-23

The stories and struggles of the growth of a ministry/church called \\"Graffiti\\" is set in a Lower East Side neighborhood in New York. It is poignant and speaks about the joys, heartaches, and relationships in day-to-day life.<br />Given the 9/11/01 events this book is well timed to remind us to get back to basics.....love, trust, kindness and honesty cross all barriers.

This book is a GREAT tool to fill your creative well. In the process you will discover joys you had pushed aside. The main tools in this twelve week workbook are the morning pages and the artist's date. Each day you journal three pages and each week you make a date with yourself. It is about nurturing and caring for yourself.<br />Often times we beat ourselves up after the world gives us the message that we are not good enough, smart enough, etc. This book peels back the layers to your true self.<br />WARNING!

The Vein of Gold goes deeper than the Artist's Way does. (AW was just the tip of the iceberg.) There is about 19 weeks of work in this book if you take your time. You &quot;write your life to right it.&quot;<br />This book continues the practice of the morning pages and the artist's dates but also gives you more assignments to do and more time to do some of them. If you are on the creative path to recovery I would highly recommend you work with this book.<br />You can jump right in but you might want to do the Artist's Way first. I faciliate groups using both books and find that the group energy adds to the synchronicity and security of having the same processes at the same time.<br />There are lovely quotes and sharing processes within the book. The sections are called &quot;Kingdoms&quot; and you explore and delve into your life story in a manner you may not have thought of yourself.<br />If you are on the creative pathway and want to move forward in your development --get this book!	2001-10-17
