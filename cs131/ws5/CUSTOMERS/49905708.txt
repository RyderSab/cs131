This can backfire, though. Faced with an information overload, the journalist has to pick-and-choose through all the data to construct her story. She probably has room only for a few of your points, and she may not choose the ones that you would like.<br /><br />Politicians understand this. When they do interviews, they focus on `talking points.' The politician prepares by selecting three or four points they want to get across during the interview. The preparation allows them to get their message across clearly and succinctly.<br /><br />You should do something similar to this to prepare for your encounters with the media. In 'Media Training 101,' Sally Stewart recommends that you have five focused and concise Key Message Points.<br /><br />Key Message Point #1 is a general statement about your company. It might include facts such as how long you have been in business, what you sell, or where you are located.<br /><br />Key Message Point #2 gives financial information. For example, revenues, growth percentage or number of units sold. Don't overload on statistics. Choose something easy to understand.<br /><br />Key Message Point #3 identifies your target market. What characteristics do your customers share? Are they consumers or businesses? Are they in a specific industry? Are they located in the same geographic area? What need do they have that your product or service fills? You might also mention your share of the market, if it is impressive.<br /><br />Key Message Point #4 addresses the company's future growth. Are you expanding into foreign markets, creating new products (or identifying new uses for existing products) to appeal to new types of customers, opening a new location or adding more employees?<br /><br />Key Message Point #5 can be anything not covered in the other four points. It is a way to point out the uniqueness of your company. You might mention awards or other recognition your company has received, the specialized training or experience of your staff, or whatever you would want customers and the public to know about your business and what makes it special.<br /><br />Once you have your Key Message Points, you are prepared for an interview at any time. This is important, because you won't always have a lot of advance notice of an interview. In some cases, you will have only minutes (if that) to prepare. With your Key Message Points you will know what to say-and when to stop talking.<br /><br />Cathy Stucker<br /><br />Author and Marketing/Publicity Consultantcompany.

That's why the 'Chicken Soup for the Soul' books are so popular. But even better than reading a great story is the experience of seeing and hearing a story performed by a skilled story teller.<br />Doug Stevenson knows how to make a story come to life, and in 'Never Be Boring Again,' he shows you how you can do it, too. He makes the process (almost!) painless, even if you are not a natural story teller.<br />This is not a book about how to give a speech. It is a detailed how-to about making powerful connections with your audience through vivid and engaging stories. And it's not just 'rah-rah.' Doug walks you through the nine steps of story structure to help you craft stories that will engage listeners and get your point across.  He shows how to incorporate The Phrase That Pays-a message that your listeners will remember and take with them. Then, Doug helps you use your body, voice and emotions to deliver a presentation that will hold the attention of any audience.<br />If you have ever watched a gifted speaker hold an audience in the palm of his hand, and wanted to know how you could do that, too, this is the book you have been waiting for.

Huge discounts, long waits for payment (often six months or more), and the dreaded returns make bookstores less than attractive markets. So what's a publisher to do? Find other places that will buy your books.<br />'Beyond the Bookstore' is your map to finding sales opportunities. The 79 strategies give specific information that will help you identify special markets for your books, locate the people who will buy from you, and make the sale. Some of the special markets identified include warehouse clubs, supermarkets, corporations, book fairs, airport stores, catalogs, museum stores, book clubs and home shopping networks. Strategies include lots of how-to, with success stories, detailed tips and contact information.<br />These strategies will work for large publishers, small presses, self-published authors, and (in many cases) Print on Demand titles. There are even strategies for leveraging your content to create new products, in addition to books.

Where do you start? What should you say? How should you format your manuscript?<br />Dan Poynter takes much of the pain out of writing, even if you are not experienced. His organization systems help you to pull together all the bits and pieces you will need to write your book. Not sure where to start? Dan suggests starting not with the first chapter, but with the one that will be shortest or easiest to write. (Good advice--it always works for me!)<br />You may find it odd that he addresses creating a mock-up of your cover before you start writing. That not only makes good sense from an organizational perspective (after all, the book cover promises what you will deliver in the book), it also helps you to think of what you are writing as a &quot;real&quot; book.<br />Once you complete the book you need to get it published. Dan helps you decide whether to self-publish or seek and agent and traditional publisher. Of course, Dan is &quot;Mr. Self-Publishing,&quot; so if you decide to self-publish, be sure to get a copy of &quot;The Self-Publishing Manual,&quot; his excellent resource for publishing and marketing your book.<br />This is a user-friendly and approachable guide to writing a nonfiction book that can be followed by anyone who wants to be published.<br />Cathy Stucker<br />Special Interests Publishing	2003-10-30

After all, when he leaves his Santa Monica apartment he must avoid curbs, crossing only where two scooped-out driveways face each other. That is only one of the obsessions and compulsions holding Daniel captive, and the twice-weekly visits of therapist-in-training Clarissa don't seem to be making much of a difference.<br />In other hands, Daniel's character could be pathetic. However, Steve Martin makes him more eccentric than truly crazy, and the coping mechanisms Daniel has developed to live within the constraints of his neuroses are actually sort of endearing. It was a joy to watch Daniel take his tentative steps toward engaging with the world, and I found myself rooting for him all along the way.<br />Even in the earliest days of his stand-up career (I've been a fan since 1970) Steve Martin's intelligence was obvious. His use of language makes his writing both funny and smart. In some ways, this novel reminded me of &quot;Roxanne,&quot; and the qualities that made that film so enjoyable.	2003-10-30

In \\"Purple Cow,\\" Seth Godin makes the point that to get the attention of customers, products have to be remarkable. That may seem obvious, but that doesn't mean that most companies understand it.<br />My favorite part of the book is \\"The Problem with Compromise.\\" As a marketing instructor and consultant, I've seen way too many businesses try to appeal to everyone, and as a result they appeal to no one.<br />Godin uses the example of vanilla ice cream. Inoffensive and bland, vanilla ice cream may be acceptable to most people, but vanilla ice cream is boring. The boring, vanilla slot is filled in most industries, so Godin says that success and growth come with products that annoy, offend, don't appeal, are too expensive, too cheap, too heavy, too complicated, too simple--too something. That means that while many people will not be attracted to your product, it will be absolutely perfect for others. They will be your customers.<br />Although Godin's advice is intended for companies of all sizes, it is especially important to small businesses. Most small companies can't afford to compete with the big guys on the big guys' terms. Instead, shake up the industry with a creative innovation and capture the niche you want to serve, while your competitors are busy making compromises to try to hold on to what they have.<br />This book will remind you of the importance of breaking away from the herd. Dare to be different, follow your passion, and the customers who share your passion will be drawn to your product.	2003-10-13

In this book, Azriela Jaffe identifies eight strategies for attracting good luck. Each strategy comes with Luck Builders, Luck Busters, and Luck Blockers--specific behaviors that can bring luck to you or chase it away. With these strategies, you can start making lucky breaks come your way.<br />Although we can't control everything in our lives, we can open the door to new opportunities and give luck easy entry into our lives. Simply changing your mindset and being open to new possibilities can make luck happen in amazing ways for you. That's the point of a story involving me that is included in &quot;Create Your Own Luck.&quot; I won't give all the details here, but on page 106 you can read about how I was able to salvage a problem situation and turn it into an exciting opportunity.<br />Being included in this book is in itself an example of one of the ways I've created luck in my life. When my problem occurred, and I made lemonade from the lemons, I posted the story to an email discussion group. Azriela saved that post and asked for my permission to include it in her book. If I hadn't taken the time to share my story, I wouldn't have been &quot;lucky&quot; enough to have my story shared with the world through this book. Just making yourself available can make you lucky!<br />I've always been a big believer in creating your own luck, and I had employed some of the strategies here intuitively. The good advice in this book showed me how to consciously and consistently use luck-creating strategies to create success after success.

For many years, it has been believed that the brain is &quot;hard-wired,&quot; a process completed early in childhood, and the adult brain can not be rewired in any significant way. The work of Dr. Schwartz and his colleagues demonstrates that the brain can be retrained to overcome the effects of illness or injury, at any age.<br />I am not a scientist, so I'll admit that some of the scientific explanations caused my brain to do some heavy lifting. And, there were parts of the chapter on the Silver Spring Monkeys I found too disturbing to read. That aside, this book excited me about the possibilities to retrain the brain. Dr. Schwartz's work has been primarily with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) patients, but the implications for other mental disorders, as well as victims of stroke and brain injury, are monumental.<br />This book also got me excited about learning other subjects it touches on, such as quantum physics and Buddhism. (Really!) If you are ready to expand your thinking on this important subject, you will certainly want to read &quot;The Mind and the Brain.&quot;	2003-01-30

It must be incredibly hard to write satire about politics these days. After all, how can you make up stuff that is more outrageous than what the real-life folks are doing? You will recognize many of the characters in this book from the Washington scene--although the names have been changed to protect the guilty--and Buckley has managed to come up with even more outrageous words and actions for them than their real-life counterparts have managed (at least so far).<br />One caution: You may not want to read this book in public. People tend to look at you strangely when you are in a public place and chuckling and giggling to yourself.	2002-11-23

Patricia Heaton and I were born 8 days apart, in different Ohio cities. We both grew up in loving families, and attended parochial schools. That's where the similarities seem to end. Patricia has four young sons, I have one neurotic dog. She is a famous TV star, and I'm, well, not. But the overwhelming feeling I had after reading this book was, &quot;I would love to have lunch with her sometime.&quot;<br />Take for example a marital conversation Patricia recounts. She read in a book that, &quot;instead of fighting . . .couples should say the word 'tone' when they feel they are being unfairly accosted verbally.&quot; Patricia and her husband, &quot;tried that once without much success. It began with me nicely asking him to take out the garbage and him saying 'Tone.' So I toned his tone. He toned my toning of his tone. Our marriage counselor told us we were both tone deaf. My husband thought Tone Def would be a cool name for a rap group or a record label.&quot;<br />Not only did I laugh out loud, I turned to my husband and informed him that someone has been listening in on our conversations. You will undoubtedly have a similar deja vu experience as you read this book if you are married or have children, if you were once a child, if you ever worked at a survival job, or if you are now a fabulously successful TV star.<br />Buy Patricia Heaton's book, pour a tall glass of your favorite beverage, curl up on the sofa and treat yourself to a funny, insightful, real and touching read. You won't regret it.	2002-10-24
