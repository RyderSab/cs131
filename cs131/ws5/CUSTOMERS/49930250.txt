The story--a memoir--is written in the most unusual and engaging literary voice I've read in months. Not a word out of place. \\"Uncle Eddy\\" has wonderful mastery of organization and rhythm in language, and a particulary strong sense of the daily absurd. Reading Wintle's tale is not unlike sitting down to coffee with an animated, cultured and highly eccentric girlfriend. Nevertheless, this documentation of the destruction of a little girl's childhood and her Uncle Eddy's frantic, well-meaning attempts to salvage her psyche and heart and provide her with a loving, stable home is also a harrowing read, particularly for a parent.  An very interesting book for adults, but not for children and certainly not for anybody who has even a smidgen of homophobia.	2005-09-15

This is an excellent addition to your bookshelf. Who but Yarbro would research the social history of the lands along the Silk Road as they were in the aftermath of a natural disaster that caused world-wide famine--and then share it with the rest of us in such an entertaining and haunting fashion? It's hard to say at this point whether I read these novels--and I read the first one to come out all those years ago and every other since then-- because I love the Count or the History. This one serves up both in gourmet style.	2005-02-08

So what? I read this novel during a snowstorm in Buffalo, and I got out of it just exactly what I was expecting:I was entertained. Had I expected fine literature, I might have been disappointed, but the Romance Genre simply does not produce works--or character studies--like those of Jane Austen and Joseph Conrad. Brockman is a fine Romance/Suspence author, and this book (as well as the last that everyone seems to love to bash) are fine examples of that genre. She's a very competent writer who makes few errors. It is likely that the negative reviews reflect the fact that in this novel the \\"Jules\\" subplot is equally as strongly written as the central \\"Cosmo\\" plot. But then you wonder, what percentage of Romance readers would've bought this book had it been marketed as a \\"Jules\\" novel with a \\"Cosmo\\" subplot? Right. And what Romance publishing house would've printed it? Hm. A few reviewers have chided her for using the book as a soapbox, but that's nothing that other Romance authors don't do regularly via their main character's thoughts & actions--one writer's vehement anti-abortion sentiments come to mind, and another's very strong religious bent.I liked this book; I was never tempted to put it down and reach over to the TBR pile for a new one. The probability of my purching her next novel: 100%.	2005-02-01

As might be expected, the moral land of gray makes for wonderful explorations of character, human behavior and reader satisfaction. Mr. Smith's writing is clear, concise and perhaps even formal in tone; perfect. These are not tales written by a lightweight.

I finished this novel 3 days ago and still cannot decide precisely what I think of it. On one hand, I despair of the author's somewhat stilted writing voice, and other editing errors. On the other hand, I find I truly like his characters and this odd little interlude in their lives. And of course, Tuscany itself is almost a character!

Yes, this novel has well-drawn characters (even the secondary characters), character development, and a fairly feisty plot that keeps rolling right along. But . . . as I read I wondered why it had not been classed on the back cover as an \\"inspirational\\" romance, because Ms. Sala uses a concrete deus ex machina, in this case a behind-the-scenes God, who appears to fix not only her plot but what ails her characters as well. This is OK, but for those of us who prefer the writer to fix her plot and characters herself, or who prefer not to read inspirational romances (which use faith-in-God as plot devices) at all, it seems like something is missing in the literary construction of the novel.	2004-12-18

In fact, romance takes a bit of a back seat to police procedure and mystery, and the book is all the stronger for it. While not heavy literature, the writing is deft and interesting, and as usual with Ms. Roberts, the characters are complex and well-drawn, and their conversations realistic.

(Sorry! No car chases or exploding buildings in this one!) You will recognize this style of writing from Jane Austen, and it's one that we see far too little of, perhaps because it doesn't sell well. Another thing that many modern readers are bound to find &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;slow&quot; are the elderly, and this novel is peopled with them. All to the good, because they prove to be wonderful characters. If your passion is ripping suspense yarns, or watching TV, then do skip this book, because you won't like it.

And Ms. Brockmann is to be congratulated for having the courage to risk her fans' ire by (gasp!) actually creating a host of new, quirky characters for us to learn to love (in subsequent novels?). Her writing is deft and intelligent. No novel in the romantic suspense genre should be expected to be a Henry James-esque exploration of character or motive. Neither should it be overly heavy on the &quot;romance,&quot; because suspense is by definition story-driven, or it just flops. In addition, when there are multiple players on the stage, any deep exploration of character, even for the main players, is challenging. In FLASHPOINT we are being introduced and given character sketches. Without a doubt, it is easier to develop a character when he first moves around as a side player for three novels. When he finally gets his own novel and starring role, he's already a multi-dimensional person--as are all the other familiar faces. With one, ensemble-player novel, that's almost impossible. (If you will remember the first novel about Tom Paoletti, you will also remember it had but 2 main characters, and 2 main side characters.)  I urge Ms. Brockmann to continue with this group of characters and not be put off by negative comments. Any writer who can produce an ensemble-cast novel of this caliber can only give us better in the future. Way to go, girl.	2004-05-03

Yes, they are slightly formulaic, yes they are historical--but what do you think the life of a putative vampire who is thousands of years old would be? Most tellingly, Saint-Germain, despite his several long-lived friends, suffers boredom and loneliness, and struggles against cynicism. The beauty of these novels is their portrayal of history without the rose-colored glasses present in most history books. Partially epistolary in form, these novels allow us to see history not through the rose-colored glasses of distance, but through the eyes of those living it as their present, and then supplies &quot;commentary&quot; in the form of Saint-Germain, whose 4,000 years of life have allowed him the time to develop modern sensibilities, as we see them. If you're looking for a horror story, you'll be disappointed; Saint-Germain is much more. If you expect institutions such as the Church and various historical figures to come out smelling like roses because the simplistic history you learned at school or even in your church suggests that it is so, you'll be disappointed as well. The reality and politics of the dark ages, say, or religion is often much nastier than we want to suppose, though it takes looking at primary sources--rather than TV and movies--to understand this. I am grateful that CQY does do this research, and then writes these novels, so the rest of us can see history--and humanity--with new eyes. A little fresh blood never hurt anybody, so to speak.	2003-12-13

Probably because it was banned, being a bit ahead of its time. In reality, this book is a lovely, wonderful metaphor for the arrival of the era of mechanization and the industrial revolution, as set against the \\"England of the Greenwood\\" (E. M. Forster). Lawrence appears to have had a fascination for this theme, as it occurs in some of his other novels as well. Far from being shunned as inappropriate for young adult readers, Lady Chatterly's Lover ought to be taught, at least at the college level, because it's a marvelous novel and should be appreciated as much, much more than a simple \\"dirty book.\\"	2003-12-12

Yes, aggressive behavior in girls can cause lasting damage, or at least lasting memories, to victims. However, if you wish to change a behavior--particularly one so very basic and pervasive as aggression and its expression, you had jolly well better understand it. Ms. Simmons seems to fall short here. Her untutored use of informants is entertaining, but unenlightening. Where are her statistics? Where are her cultural comparisons? Her examination of the history of female aggression? Where is all the latest data on, for example, Gossip, or, Shunning, the process of Friend-Making, or Social Leveling Mechanisms? (She says it does not exist; it does.) Her book is less a scholarly work drawing upon psychology, sociology, anthro or evolutionary psychology than it is a rant. If your daughter is the victim of female-female aggression--or the perpetrator--this book will not help you understand enough about the dynamics of those interactions to be of any use. It will merely assure you that others have had the same experiences. The best that can be said for Ms. Simmons' book is that it draws attention to an interesting subject, one worthy of much deeper, more intelligent and more practical investigation.	2003-11-11
