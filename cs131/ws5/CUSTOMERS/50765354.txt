Jilly's business is vintage clothes. Rory's is software, the Senate, and a legendary acting family. His ward is someone Jilly desperately wants to get close to. Meeting Rory throws her for a loop though. Meeting Jilly ('sexcandy') at a time when he is trying to keep his reputation spotless really flusters Rory. There is also a wonderful secondary romance. Rory's ward is a delight too. All these elements come together to form a very special book. I highly recommend THIS PERFECT KISS.	2001-02-04

This has been my absolute favorite. It's one of those books you can't put down. Anthony and Kate's relationship develops believably, the dialogue is superb, the secondary characters are fabulous, and Lady Whistledown's gossip pages are so much fun. <br />This book has a perfect balance between laughter and seriousness, something that it is very difficult to achieve. If you like fun, sexy, emotional, never-boring, unputdownable romances, read this book.	2000-12-17

Carter &quot;Blue&quot; McCoy is a member of an elite group of Navy SEALs. He travels home to Hatboro Creek to attend the wedding of his stepbrother to his childhood sweetheart. One of the first people he sees is Lucy Tait, police rookie and a girl he knew in high school. Lucy has had a crush on Blue for more than 10 years. Seeing him again jolts her. He is instantly attracted to her. They decide to engage in a brief affair. Brief becasue Blue will leave Hatboro Creek after the wedding; SEALs never stay in one place. But things get complicated when Blue's stepbrother turns up dead and Blue is the main suspect in his murder. <br />I just read my synopsis and realized that I cannot accurately convey how good this book is. Blue is tough, quiet, strong, and stern. He's also kind and honorable and darn sexy. I remembered him as an intriguing character from the 1st book in this series, PRINCE JOE. He makes an absolutely wonderful hero in FOREVER BLUE. Lucy is tough, direct, courageous, and (gasp!) not a virgin. (Regular romance readers will know what I mean by that last one.) I really, really liked Lucy. Blue and Lucy together are very hot, sweet, and sometimes even funny. <br />I usually dislike suspense or mystery in romances, but Brockmann knows how to incorporate these elements without taking away from the romance. I liked FOREVER BLUE even better than PRINCE JOE, which I would grade an A. I guess that means FOREVER BLUE is an A+.	2000-09-22

I usually dislike any action/adventure in romances because the authors  forget to concentrate on the characters and spend the entire book on car  chases and gunfights. Well, Brockmann is one author who does it right! The  characters are always the focus, with the action a nice bonus. <br />Joe Cat  is a wonderful hero: a tough, intelligent, funny, blue-collar kind of guy.  He is the leader of the Alpha Squad of the Navy SEALs. Veronica is a  high-class and hoity toity media consultant. A job brings them together:  Joe must pose as the Prince of Eustanzia to catch a terrorist. Veronica  must turn this macho sailor with the atrocious New Jersey accent into a  prince in 2 days! <br />The attraction between them is immediate and very  powerful, but many things stand in their way. Joe, a usually confident man,   feels insecure for the first time. His blue-collar background makes him  think Veronica won't want him for more than a fling. Is he right? You have  to read the book! Veronica, for her part, is scared for Joe as catching  dangerous terrorists is a daily thrill for him. Does she ask him to quit  the SEALs? You have to read the book! Believe me, it's better than I can  ever describe. <br />I was excited to learn that this is Brockmann's 1st book  in a 10-book (or more) series about Navy SEALs. I am looking forward to  reading the rest of the books in this series.	2000-08-10

They are poor as dirt and Esme, the practical one, decides she needs to &quot;marry up&quot; with Cleavis  Rhy in order to secure her family a real home and regular meals. Esme is  not *really* manipulative, just desperate. She is warm, fun, earthy, and  just what Cleav needs! <br />Cleavis is the storekeeper and the richest man in  town. On the surface, he is the perfect gentleman: polite, smartly dressed,  upright, and uptight. Esme's first words to him, &quot;You wanna marry  me?&quot;, startle him. She distracts him with her forwardness and tempts  him by constantly flipping up her skirts to adjust her sagging stockings.  You see, Esme can't afford garters. <br />This is a fun, warm, charming,  emotional book. I enjoyed it tremendously and recommend it highly.

Cora Downes is a merchant's daughter who enters London's elite society after rescuing a duke's son. The genuine and fun-loving Cora feels out of place in cold London society. Her fear of the aristocracy does not extend  to Francis Kneller though. He is a duke's son, but Cora feels comfortable  around him. Francis is amused by Cora and decides to ease her entrance into  society by paying attention to her. After he inadvertantly compromises her  twice, Francis offers Cora marriage. They enter into a marriage neither  really wants.<br />I loved that Cora was not a member of the ton. I loved  Francis Kneller's pink coats and lace. I loved their relationship. There is  much humor to be had in The Famous Heroine, but it never overshadows the  romance. It develops slowly and believably. Mary Balogh has written another  winner!	2000-07-21

Morgan caught my attention in the 1st book of this series, SAWYER. He's a large, muscle-bound, bad-tempered giant with a marshmallow center. His sister-in-law's sister,  Misty Malone, comes to Buckhorn for a visit. She has just lost her job and  is currently homeless, among other problems. Morgan and Misty are  immedietely attracted to each other. But when Misty introduces herself,  Morgan decides he cannot get involved with her sexually because she is  family. Misty has sworn off men after her experiences with her ex-fiance  and father. Morgan wants her to leave town immediately and stop flirting  with his brothers, but once he learns about her problems he has a change of  heart. Morgan and Misty's story is fun, funny, sexy, and touching. The  secondary characters are Morgan's fabulous, gorgeous, sexy brothers. I like  the family feel to this book and can't wait for Gabe's story next month.	2000-07-04

The story revolves around how plain Jane Wentworth and rakish Quentin Somerville meet, marry and then fall in love. <br />Jane is in her fifth London Season, an on-the-shelf miss. She has been  admiring Quentin Somerville from afar for many years. Outwardly, he is  charming, handsome, and sensual. She fancies herself in love. He fancies  himself in love with her beautiful and gentle stepsister.<br />Quentin has a  plan to compromise the stepsister at a masked ball so that he will have to  marry her. But it goes awry when it is Jane (in the stepsister's costume  and mask) he corners instead. They are forced to marry and he is quite  livid. He believes she manipulated him. Their marriage starts off  horrifically on their wedding night. Afterward, he banishes Jane to his  country estate. After a couple of months, he is forced by circumstances to  join her there. What follows is a sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes funny,  sometimes poignant unfolding of their relationship. Jane gets to know the  real Quentin, not the perfect one she imagined him to be. Quentin slowly  overcomes his self-loathing and starts to notice his wife. <br />A Perfect  Scoundrel is a wonderfully written, beautiful love story. All the  characters had personality, flaws, and layers. Quentin is very hard to like  at the beginning, but his transformation is believable and wonderful to  witness. This book is definitely a keeper!	2000-07-04

It is a wonderful blend of family, fun, and sex!<br />Sawyer saves Honey Malone when her car crashes into his lake. He is the only doctor in the small town of Buckhorn, so he takes her to his home  (AKA office) to recuperate. The attraction between Sawyer and Honey is  instant and intense. Nobody writes sexual tension like Lori Foster.  Whew!<br />For me, the best thing about this book was the entire cast of  characters. Sawyer lives in a huge house with his 15 year-old son and his  three fabulous brothers. Casey, his son, is a future heartbreaker. Morgan,  the sheriff, is a huge, sexy, bad-tempered sheriff with a heart of gold.  His story is next and I can't wait! Jordan is the quiet, intense, sexy  animal lover. And Gabe is the youngest brother: a lazy, sexy, heartthrob  handyman with too many women that he knows what to do with. They are all  gorgeous, sexy, wonderful...mother hens. They gather around the injured,  lost Honey Malone and 'adopt' her. Watching them do it makes you laugh and  sigh. <br />This is going to be a wonderful series.

I've never read a book by this author, so I didn't know what to expect. Well, this is a wonderful contemporary romance and I'm glad I read it. I will be hunting down this author's older  titles like nobody's business!<br />Dorsey and Adam are a fun, sexy, and  endearing couple. Adam is a very wealthy and very sexy publisher of an  elitist, sexist men's magazine (hey, I'm a feminist). Dorsey, on the other  hand, has many professions. She's a bartender at the exclusive men's club  Adam attends (doing 'research' for her sociology dissertation), a teaching  assistant at Severn College, and the reluctant author of HOW TO TRAP A  TYCOON. Adam doesn't know that Dorsey is the author of the book that is  &quot;wreaking indigestion on most men&quot;. The secondary characters are  all wonderful too. I especially enjoyed Adam's young, cynical staff writer  and Dorsey's mother. (Separately, not together)<br />The book summary does a  much better job of explaining the plot than I do. You really have to read  the book to appreciate it. It's great fun! If you read this book, I doubt  you'll be disappointed. I laughed out loud several times. I rarely put down  the book and when I did it was with great reluctance. Very highly  recommended.<br />P.S. There's also a fabulous secondary romance. What more  could you ask for?	2000-06-12

Anthony is absent 8 years from his home when he receives the request (order) from his father to return immediately. Anthony is independently wealthy and independent in all other ways, so why would he return to the  family he has not set eyes on in 8 years? Well...<br />Anthony, the heir to a  dukedom, marries an impoverished mouse of a gentlewoman below his station.  He acquires this &quot;temporary wife&quot; in order to &quot;stick  it&quot; to his estranged father (the duke) after he has been summoned  home. <br />His bride, Charity Duncan, seems like the perfect little  &quot;mouse&quot; to enrage his father. His plan is to marry her, use her  for a few weeks to assert his independence from his father, then separate  from her permanently.<br />Charity agrees to this because her family is in  debt and, as the eldest sibling, feels this marriage is the only way to  save her family from poverty and hardship. You see, Anthony will make her a  wealthy woman for life if she marries him and lets him use her as a pawn  for only a few weeks.<br />Things do not go as planned for either of them.  Charity's warm presence in her new husband's stuffy, loveless family causes  heartache, enlightenment, healing, love, grief, etc. Anthony learns very  quickly that Charity is NOT a mouse. Charity learns quickly that there is  more to Anthony than the cold, calculating, rigid man he seems.<br />The  relationship between Anthony and Charity is a unique one and develops with  care. This is NOT a case of &quot;First comes love, then comes  marriage&quot;. The sequence of events in their relationship is  unconventional and they all unfold in a very satisfying way.<br />Great book!  Read it!	2000-06-10

He is a much-feared warrior  nick-named the Black Dragon. He conquers castle Rhuddlan, but must  nevertheless fight his legitimate half-brother in a tournament to become  its lord. In the process, he must wed Lady Arianna. This illegitimate son  of a nobleman is weary of fighting and wants his own land and title enough  to consent to an arranged marriage. Lady Arianna is horrified by the  thought of marrying the Norman who killed her brother in battle. Suffice it  to say that theirs is a chaotic and emotionally brutal union. And this is  only the first 100 pages! What follows is quite a beautiful and  heart-wrenching read.<br />There is much strife, turmoil, and heartbreak in  this multi-layered story. However, there is enough humor and laughter to  save it from becoming depressing. <br />I loved this book. It is now one of my  very favorites.

He was immediately taken with Harriet and twice  offered to make her his mistress. Harriet, although very attracted to  Archie, refused because she was a virtuous young woman.<br />TEMPTING HARRIET  begins six years later. Harriet is now Lady Harriet Wingham, a 28-year-old  widow and mother. Archie is still a rake, but he is also the Duke of Tenby.  He decides, at 32, to do his &quot;duty&quot; and find himself a wife. He  goes to London for the Season to check out the marriage mart. At a ball, he  sees Harriet dancing and can't beleive his eyes. Neither can Harriet. She  is no longer a naive girl with no experience and is again extremely tempted  by Archie. She becomes his mistress, despite the fact that it pricks her  conscience. He takes her as his mistress, despite the fact that he loves  her and wants to offer her marriage. But he knows he cannot 'lower' himself  to marry a mere widow of a baron. <br />I don't want to give anything away.

He doesn't not know why he should feel guilt  since theirs is not a love match and it is common practice for husbands of  the ton to keep mistresses. <br />I don't usually like any kind of adultery in  my romance books. However, I'll make an exception for THE OBEDIENT BRIDE.  Mary Balogh writes about it in a very satisfying way. By the end of the  book, I was rooting for Geoffrey and Arabella. I was extremely happy by  Geoffrey's actions after Arabella found out about his mistress. Did he  become angry and arrogant? No. Did he become immediately contrite and admit  he was wrong. No. <br />Read this book! It is wondurful.	2000-05-22

Putney's first contemporary deals with a very difficult, emotional and brutal subject. I believe she has handled it well. Her portrayal of Patrick is as realistic as it gets.

Damien is quite the rakehell. The very first thing he (ahem) does in the book sort of tips you off to his wicked ways. If I must complain about anything, it is only that I found the  ending a bit rushed. <br />I am totally in love with 2 of Damien's fellow  Hellfire League members: Nick Sabine (the American) and Lord Jeremy Clune  (was he the villian? He was too sexy to be a villian!). Highly recommended!	2000-05-06

Highly recommended!	2000-05-03

It is also one of my favorite romances ever. It is extremely well-written, dark, sexy, humurous in a black humor kind of way, romantic, and emotional. The plot is original and daring. Killoran is the dark lord to end all dark lords. Emma is his perfect match.  Additionally, there are wonderful secondary characters: honorable  Nathaniel, Lady Barbara of the bad reputation, and the elderly, bawdy Lady  Seldane. And two creepy villians, Miriam and Darnley. The ending is superb.  Don't miss this book!	2000-04-19

This time around it is between a devoted single father who has all the pressures imaginable of a single father (and then some) and his daughter's counselor. Ordinary, everyday  people in ordinary professions. But what a great book! I loved it. Highly  recommended.	2000-04-15

This was my first book by Mary Balogh and it certainly won't be the last. Freddie is very flawed and filled with self-loathing. He makes so MANY mistakes, but you can't help but adore the scoundrel! He is a handsome  &quot;rake&quot; who marries the lame, plain Clara for her money. Clara is  no idiot heroine (thank you!). She is well aware of why Freddie is marrying  her. She marries him for his handsomeness and because simply looking at him  brings some sunlight into her dreary life. Their story is highly original  and develops beutifully. The writing is superb. I just loved this book!  Very highly recommended.	2000-04-03

This is the 1st in a trilogy. I highly enjoyed it. The heroine is a workaholic doctor. The hero is a devoted single father. His adorable son suffered a terrible accident that left him burned. The heroine takes a strong interest in his case and his father. Lovely story. Highly  recommended. Can't wait for Sean's story!	2000-04-03

I enjoyed it tremendously. The writing is fluid (thank you!), the story is original, and the characters are believable and well-developed. I cried for  the soldiers who died. The descriptions of death and disease as a result of  war were simple, but so real that you can't help but feel it. But mostly I  chuckled and laughed out loud at Lydia's thoughts and actions. And  thankfully, Major Sam Reed is no cardboard hero. He is brave and  compassionate, but also somewhat of a liar (for certain reasons, he tells  his family he married a nonexistant woman named Delightful Saunders and had  a nonexistant child with her and talks Lydia into marrying him to save his  tail!). I highly recommend this book! Very original. Very well-written. I  had almost given up reading romance after some rather excruciating  experiences with a hero and his manroot and another hero who was over-sexed  to say the least. Well, I'm off to look for her other books!	2000-04-03

I previously read THE LADY'S TUTOR by Schone and it was also very good. I confess I have not read a lot of erotic romance because before I picked up a Robin Schone book, they all  disappointed me. This book is very well-written and has a story to go along  with the 'erotic romance'. Good stuff!	2000-03-31

After reading three books in a row where the writing made me cringe and throw the book down, reading HEARTTHROB was a delight! The writing was fluid, thank you. No stumbling along here. A great story, a wonderful  romance (Jericho/Jed and Kate), a sweet secondaty romance, and fantastic  writing. AND I couldn't put it down. I started it last night and finished  it today. (If you're like me and you didn't like the pink cover...overlook  it! You won't be sorry.)	2000-03-21

In a genre where too many books seem to blend together until I can hardly tell them apart, LORD OF SCOUNDRELS is a true original. I haven't read anything like it. Dain and  Jessica are a very unique, loveable, frustrating, sexy couple. But there is  so much more to it than that and I fear I don't have the words. Only this:  DO NOT MISS THIS BOOK! Reading it was a true pleasure. Jessica calls Dain  Lord Beelzebub. I loved that she wasn't clueless or skittish around Dain.  Dain has been used to most people, especially women, looking at him as  though he is a freak. He's big, brutish, and a bully. He's also a  &quot;whoremonger&quot; who has sworn never to get involved with a lady.  But Jessica gets under his skin upon their first meeting. She accepts the  fact that for the first time in her life, she has fallen in MAJOR lust with  a man. This is where the fun begins. The prose is fluid, lyrical, and  smooth. It NEVER falters. The dialogue is the most original and witty  dialogue I've read in a very long time. Don't miss it!	2000-03-20

It is a definite 'keeper' in my opinion. The heroine, Mary, was a great match for Wolf. I thought DREAM MAN was my favorite Linda Howard book, but now it's #2 after MACKENZIE'S MOUNTAIN. Well, I'm off to  read about Wolf's son, Joe, in MACKENZIE'S MISSION!	2000-03-09

First, let me say this is a sequel to COP OF THE YEAR. Anyway, I loved this story. I never thought a 46-year-old high school principal could make a sexy hero. I was very wrong! That is what makes this story irresistible.  It is modern and about everyday people. At the same time, it is so  wonderfully different from what I'm used to reading in romance. This is the  fifth book I've read by Kathryn Shay. I've loved them all. I highly  recommend COP OF THE YEAR and her 'America's Bravest' trilogy: FEEL THE  HEAT, THE MAN WHO LOVED CHRISTMAS, and CODE OF HONOR. Along with Judith  McNaught, Patricia Gaffney, Laura Kinsale, and Susan E. Phillips, Kathryn  Shay is my favorite author.	2000-03-04

This latest in her contemporary series about firefighters is exceptionally well-written, sexy, emotional, and sometimes funny. I just love Jake and Chelsea together. Jake is stoic, gorgeous, and Chelsea's boss...Uh-oh! The  story is irresistible. I hope this is not the last book in her series. I  hope Delaney and Reed's story is next! I highly recommend the 1st two in  this series, FEEL THE HEAT and THE MAN WHO LOVED CHRISTMAS. I Loooove this  series!	2000-02-24

He is generous, kind, confident, &quot;devastatingly handsome&quot;, and proud. FINALLY! I hero who isn't arrogant to the point of being cruel and obnoxious. A non-tortured hero who  is every bit as enthralling and interesting as the misunderstood and very  tortured heroes of most romantic fiction. Mick is (gasp!) a nice man. But  make no mistakes, ladies (and gents): He is most definitely NOT a wimp. He  is as manly a man as they come. He just happens to be kind as well. He is  quite yummy. As if that weren't enough, the story is irresistible. This  book is one of my very favorites. Thanks, Judith Ivory!	2000-02-22

This book was sitting right next to SEP's FIRST LADY. I picked it up becuase the cover caught my eye (and it was sitting next to my FAVORITE author's new book). I noticed it  was an Avon book so I just up and bought the thing. Finally read it...very,  very great! I'm glad I picked it up. I very highly recommend it.

This storyline has been done before. Finally, someone has done it right! THE MAN WHO LOVED CHRISTMAS is a delightful, emotional love story not to be missed. Watching Beth and Dylan's relationship change is sometimes fun,  sometimes heartwrenching, and always sexy! Their animosity starts in FEEL  THE HEAT where they star as secondary characters.

It is the second in her trilogy (the 1st being TO LOVE AND TO CHERISH). It has such amazing depth and characterization...I was entralled while reading it. Sebastian is not a  simple man. He is very flawed and very selfish. He is also extremely weary  of being that way and his truggle to change is truly courageous and  heart-wrenching. His treatment of Rachel at times borders on the  unforgivable. Their story is multi-layered, very emotional, and sometimes  dark. This is an exceptional book...Do not miss it!	2000-02-14

This is the 2nd in her series about firefighters. I am a very serious romance reader and I tend to stay away from Harlequins because, in my opinion, most of them are not good. But I am glad I listened to my friend and read this book! It is certainly one of my favorites and the equal of  any &quot;mainstream&quot; romance book I've read. Dylan is irresistble and  Beth (who he calls &quot;Lizzie Borden&quot;) is his perfect match. The  characters are well-developed, the story is emotional and sexy, and the  entire book is very well-written. I recommend you start with Shay's 1st  book in this trilogy, FEEL THE HEAT. Dylan and Beth are in this one as  secondary characters. To say they do not see eye to eye is an  understatement! It is a joy to watch their turbulent and hostile  relationship develop! Do NOT miss this book!	2000-02-12

Especially the 1st 100 pages or so...and the hero and heroine haven't even touched! Ms. Schone knows the best way to write an erotic  romance: engage the reader's MIND first. And don't write sex scenes just  for the sake of having sex scenes. Ms. Schone treats her readers with  respect by not writing down to them. She has brought quality writing to  erotic romantic fiction! This book is exquisitely well-written. It is also  emotional and enlightening. Do not miss it!	2000-02-12

It's just too darn wonderful to pass up. It is  original, sexy, funny, and emotional. You will chuckle, laugh out loud,  cry, sob, yell at Bobby Tom, swoon at Bobby Tom, and want to kiss Bobby Tom  senseless!

Kenny is good enough to eat, ladies. And Emma is  hilarious. They are true opposites, but perfect together. Please read this  book for the hot tub scene alone. RUN to your local bookstore and buy  yourselves a copy of this book. It is simply delightful. I could NOT put it  down (and believe me, I usually have a very short attention span!). Happy  reading!

It is emotional, sexy, enlightening, and exciting.  (Read it for the billiards scene alone! Whew!)You will also get to meet the  3 other members of the Fallen Angels: Rafe, Lucien, and a very tortured  Michael. All three are fascinating and all three get their own stories in  other books!

I started this book wanting another fun, sexy, frivolous romp of a book. The kind of book that you enjoy while you're reading it, but forget as soon as you put  it down. The characters in THE RAKE are UNforgettable. Putney is a truly  gifted writer and I fear she has ruined me for most of the genre now. I now  have a much higher standard of quality that I want to achieve while I am  reading a &quot;romance&quot; book. THUNDER AND ROSES is my next Putney  book and I cannot wait to get started. For readers who enjoy romance: this  book is deep, emotional, and deals with alcoholism in a very realistic  manner. However, it is also sexy and fun. Do NOT miss this book!	1999-12-26
