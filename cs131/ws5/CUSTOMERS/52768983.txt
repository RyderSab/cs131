The rest were weak and/or disgusting.  The fact that I was 10 pages from the end and could put it down until the next day says something.  Save your money.  I have read a few others by this author and cannot really recommend her.	2001-05-16

But I still thought it was a good book.  I have not read too many of this author's books but I am not in the group that thinks she is great.  I admit that I did NOT like Knight in Shining Armor.  I liked The Velvet Promise but did not like Velvet Song.  Perhaps I enjoyed it because my expectations were not as high as other readers.	2001-05-07

If I had not read some of her other books, I would not do so now.  All of the demolition stuff bored me after a bit.  The mystery of the cause of the problems seemed obvious.  I did not like Kate, her mother, her father or her friends.  The only one I liked was Donovan and I felt bad for liking an abusive guy.  I was happy that the retelling of the violence was not too detailed or too violent.  I have read much worse in &quot;Romance&quot; novels and was led to believe that this one was difficult to read.  While I think no one should put up with being hit even one time and should definitely not feel shame as though they were the cause of the violence, I think that the way this story was written one could believe that Donovan was no longer dangerous.  Kate seemed to come from a pretty messed up family and I almost felt that the reformed Donovan deserved better.  In the end I just didn't care about any of them.	2001-05-04

I never really cared for the doctor and the whole premise of the man seeing her and then announcing that he would marry her was hard to accept.  I  certainly don't know why he bothered with her.  I suspect the book was  typical of when it was written.	2000-07-13

(These books were given to me.)  I only read the Snowbound one.  I liked it more than The Game Is Played but it was still just okay.  The premise of this guy seeing the girl and  falling in love were easier to accept here, but he really seemed pretty  rude.

If this had been my first Gibson book, I probably would have given it four stars.  It just entertain me as much as the others.  I liked Joe and Gabrielle.  I didn't  even mind the New Age stuff.

Lots of sex--some that I could not quite picture, some that I'd wished that I couldn't.  It was boring after a bit.  And a little too dark.

I really enjoyed NEVER BEFORE and I am looking forward to NEVER SAY NEVER, but this one just didn't keep my interest.

Wow! Big disappointment. The first five pages are devoted to extolling the benefits of having parents who are divorced (two houses, two birthdays, two Christmases, etc.); then when she was about half way through the book, my  seven year old looks up and says &quot;Dad, she lied to her daddy!&quot;.

(We bought books #1 and #2 but returned them both after reading book #1) O.K., I was prepared for the continuous advertisement for the Clue Jr. board game, but I was apalled by the behavior of the kids in this  &quot;club&quot;. The mysteries they solve are mostly catching each other  lying, cheating, and framing the other members of the club! I really don't  want my daughter to perceive that I condone or accept that kind of  behavior. I sure don't want her to think that membership in a club is worth  putting up with lying, cheating club members. I was hoping for an updated  Nancy Drew kind of story, with &quot;good guys&quot; who really are good.  On the other hand, these books may help improve the quality of your child's  fabrications...	1999-12-29

I enjoyed reading it, but had a problem with it almost from the beginning.  I know that Elenore's life was pretty  bad, but she went along alittle too easily with marring a guy who raped  her.  And then once she marries, she accepts the &quot;mistress&quot; much  too easily.  And for much too long.

I guess it's a silly thing that bothered me but bother me it did.  In the beginning of the story Tess is portrayed as frail, weak, afraid, skinny.  Then once  she is left by Curt she becomes a different character.  I had a hard time  reconciling the early Tess with the Tess who wore her guns backwards, could  flip a steer and do all the other stuff that the men did.

I typically don't like time-travel books, but I really enjoyed this one.  Hawk was a great man.  He truly seemed perfect in about every way.  Adam was cleverly written.  My only complaint is that Adrienne  is a bit too shrewish and took too long to admit her feelings.  I get a  little tired of having one character who is clearly good and another  character who chooses not to see this.  But I am keeping this one and  recommending it to my friends.	1999-05-17

And someone had told me it was good!  <br />The doctor and Dallas only seemed to be good friends yet they agree to marry after only knowing  each other for a few weeks.  He dies and then she meets the brother.  She  distrusts him, overcomes that, looks forward to a date with him and then  cries over Dallas.  It didn't work for me.  Then things get resolved, a  YEAR passes and just like that, things are better than before.  Dallas and  Jack seemed TOO different from each other to be believed.  <br />Don't waste  your time or money on this one.	1999-05-15

But the guy happens to meet the girl, he's attracted to her, and they become friends.  At least a couple of time  before she's married Archibald, the guy asks her to marry him.  She says no  and wonders if she made a mistake.  Well, shortly after the  &quot;marriage&quot; things change and the guy offers again.  This time  Sara accepts.  Eventually they end up together and it's like he's a  different character.  He acts like he was trapped and had no choice.  It  just seemed inconsistent and bothered me.  Maybe I missed something  crucial.  Anyway, I've liked their other books much more.	1999-05-08

I thought that the beginning held more promise than was delivered. I had a hard time with Alex.  After what had happened the last time she was with her husband, it was hard to imagine her  sleeping with a stranger about a day after she met him.  There seemed to be  a lot to love about John but what about her caused him to fall in love?   Her pain?  Her willingness to waitress even after obviously always having  had money?  Please.

I liked Quint even though he was usually nasty to Madelyne.  That was the problem I had with the book and why I could not give it five stars.  Quint is nasty to his wife and  untrusting.  He leaves her for long periods of time, questions the  legitimacy of his son and virtually anything that his wife says.  I think  that would be very, very hard to love.	1999-02-27

Sure she loved him, but 12 years to wait for someone who has never treated you like anything but a friend?  I  don't think so. Not even for a  romance novel.  And his claim that she  trapped him.   It did not seem like that to me.  I thought the back summary  made the book sound better than it was.  Is she worth reading again?	1999-02-19

I could even see how he fell in love with Flora since she seemed to be everything a man could want.  Other than being sexy and a good  dad I did not see that much to recommend Adam.  So much of their  relationship seemed to be about sex.  Other than being faithful to each  other they seemed to lack any sense of right and wrong regarding sex.  Plus  it is hard for me to equate sex and love when the &quot;f&quot; word is  being used.  It was still a good enough story, but not worth reading again.	1999-02-01

The fat counting is pretty old news now but I imagine it was of more interest when it was written.  What a jerk Diana's husband was!!  He was really pretty funny though.   Chris seemed just about perfect.  If not for JoJo, maybe he would have  been.  Diana did not seem to live a very moral life once she separated,  lost weight, and was sought after.  A bad example for her kids.  But I  liked the book anyway.	1999-01-06

I would not read it again.  I got alittle tired or Rand(y)'s almost constant state or arousal when Josselyn was around.  Sure he admired  her intellect, her loyalty, her spirit, but that lust was almost always the  driving force.  And Josselyn's constant--I shouldn't want him.  He's my  enemy.  I hate him.  But...--got tiresome.  If it had not been by Ms  Becnel, I might not even have given the book a three.  Do I want to bother  with the second story?  I doubt it.  I did not even like the character  Rhonwen.  Rhys and Jasper seemed okay, but Rhonwen irritated me.  I'll try  her again, but I'll heed other readers comments first.	1999-01-03

It did not bother me that he slept with her while trying to marry her off since we were to believe that he loved her at that point.  It bothered me more that he slept with  her in the first place.  He wasn't that drunk!  And she was half his age.   It also bothered me that he was never honest about his past until he had to  be and then she was not even upset!  I also find it depressing to read  about alcoholics.  But for some reason I liked the book enough to give Ms  Feather another chance.	1998-11-26

I found Travis to be sort of flat.  There just didn't  seem to be much to like or dislike about him although he was sweet.  The  trial also seemed to be lacking.  Couldn't there have been more to flesh it  out.  It seemed like the Will character was going to provide some  interesting conflict but not much came of it.  Perhaps if I had not read it  right after reading Ethan's story I would have enjoyed it more.	1998-10-08

I did enjoy the book but thought that the resolution was to quick  and too easy.  I understood that Shannon loved Whip and that he was honest  about his plans from the beginning, but how much can a person really take.   I would think his constant reminders that he wanted her and nothing more  would have diminished the love.  In any case, I did enjoy the book but I  would have enjoyed a more fleshed-out resolution.	1998-08-19

I only wish that the characters were not SO slow to realize that each loved the other.  I guess that that is just the way it goes.  How could Sabrina not know how sweet Ian was right from the start.

Overall I liked it although I never really cared for Adam or Banner.  Also, I know it's a romance novel, but falling in love in a day or a week.  Please.  I would have felt better even if details were omitted just knowing that weeks had past and that they at least got to know each other better. It seemed like Jeff spent more time with Banner and knew her better than Adam did.   When Banner and Adam fell in love and got married, Adam wasn't yet convinced that Banner was a good doctor.  I found that I was much more interested in Jeff throughout the book.  The resolution of the mountain visits did surprise me though.	1998-05-29

At first the story seemed to be about Jenny and Trell.  Later Trell was a very small part.  Travis seemed to take over.  There was a lot going on, but it just stopped being interesting.
