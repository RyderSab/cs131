As a student of the Bible, I can't take parts of the Law (leaving out the other aspects) and base a diet plan on them. Does God really care about toothpaste with floride vs. toothpaste without? Hmm. Not sure on that one. My heart tells me no.<br />My three stars are for the common sense part of Maker's Diet. We do need to take care of our bodies and be as healthy as we can.	2004-07-05

Ahab's great battle with the white whale Moby Dick was shadowed by the struggle of a woman desiring to understand the heart of a man. Good story.	2004-07-05
