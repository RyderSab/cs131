They're delightfully crazy and include a cross-dressing navigator, a talking bat, an old cannibal who isn't allowed to eat humans anymore, and a tribe of native Micronesians that is obsessed with People magazine. They're all quirky and fun to read about and though most of them don't have too much depth, it's not really needed. They're caricatures and wonderful ones. That's all that they need to be for this story.<br /><br />The best parts of the story are those that feature one or a few of the characters doing things that are only minimally related to the actual plot of the book. The little peaks into their lives enhanced the caricatures, gave a small peak into their motivations, and provided a lot of amusement for the reader. After all, where else can you find a High Priestess of a small island tribe who is obsessed with shoes and soap operas and isn't even a member of the tribe?<br /><br />The plot of Island of the Sequined Love Nun is extremely far fetched and full of holes, but it somehow works. It's almost like those things that are so ridiculous that they have to be true...because nobody would actually make something like that up. This is so ridiculous that it's easy to suspend disbelief and just enjoy it. Nothing really fits, but when it's put together it somehow makes a coherent whole, one that's enjoyable in its own crazy way.<br /><br />Really, the only way to describe Island of the Sequined Love Nun is that it's just crazy. It shouldn't' work, but it does, thanks to Moore's talent at pulling together stories that are as strange and amusing as his titles. Jibes and jokes abound in the story as Moore pokes fun at just about everything he can. Some are obvious, some are subtle and no reader will catch them all, but there are enough to keep almost anyone amused all the way through the book.<br /><br />Island of the Sequined Love Nun is not great literature, but it is highly entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a few chuckles. Nothing was really laugh-out-loud funny, but the majority of the book was highly amusing and entertaining. Anyone who likes out-there humor will likely enjoy this book very much.s.

US	15853110	R3NLWIEXPY7HNI	0765342308	119454509	Briar Rose	Books	3	4	8	N	N	Good Holocaust story, poor faerie tale	In Briar Rose, Yolen uses the faerie tale Sleeping Beauty as the framework for a Holocaust story, drawing parallels between the two stories and changing the faerie tale where needed to make it fit. The result is two intertwining tales, one various parts of the distorted Sleeping Beauty told again and again, and the other the quest of Becca to discover who her grandmother really was. The second leads to the discovery and telling of a Holocaust tale many don't know.<br /><br />One thing that every reader needs to be aware of is that Briar Rose is not Sleeping Beauty in a Holocaust setting. It is not a faerie tale. Even the repeated telling of Sleeping Beauty is distorted and unpleasant and certainly not a version that I personally would want told to me again and again. In short, don't read this if you're in the mood for something fun and lighthearted. The Holocaust story may be toned down so it's appropriate for children, but it's still there and there is no escaping it if you read this book.<br /><br />As a Holocaust story for children, I think that Briar Rose was well done. I personally would have preferred it if the facts hadn't been stretched so much, but I suppose in the large picture changing the fate of one person to make the story work isn't such a big deal. After all, Yolen does not ever claim that this story is the truth. It's simply a story based around some awful truths.<br /><br />The characterization in Briar Rose was decent. Becca was well developed, but many of her family members seemed flat, as though Yolen put them in to do what they needed to do and that was it. I didn't feel like there was any development for anyone except Becca and Magda, which was disappointing, particularly when it came to Stan. I just didn't see any chemistry there at all, and the romance aspect was not developed nearly enough to justify it being in the book.<br /><br />The plot of the story is highly improbable (and in fact we know that it did not happen as she states so in the back), but there were so many improbable things of that nature that did happen during the Holocaust that I was willing and able to suspend my disbelief enough that the plot worked.<br /><br />The one plot-hole that bothered me was the time frame. It just seems as though it should have taken Becca longer to accomplish what she did in Poland, particularly since she didn't speak the language. The coincidence that enabled the short time-frame was the thing that was most difficult for me to read. It just seemed like too big of a coincidence.<br /><br />However, I think that Briar Rose does do a good job of putting the horrors of the Holocaust on a level that younger readers can understand. Yolen didn't skimp on the horrors, though there isn't nearly as much detail as there likely would have been in a book for older readers. She doesn't pretend it didn't happen and she presents it in a way that is much easier to absorb and understand than the straight lists of facts that usually have to be learned.<br /><br />If you're looking for a faerie tale, this book is not for you.

It is much more action-filled than the previous book in the series, and as such is much more satisfying. While the first book in the series felt almost like a prologue until the very end, plenty happens in this book to justify the long set up.<br /><br />In Hidden Truth things move beyond character and setting and into the actual plot that Cook only hinted at in the first book of this series. The world is developed further, new characters are introduced, and plot twists keep things very interesting.<br /><br />The only thing that wasn't different from the first book was the characterization. Though there was further development of Alissa towards the end of the book, and there was a new major character introduced, for the most part, the characterization did not change from what was developed in book one. This is not a bad thing, as the characterization in book one was strong, but it would have been nice to see some further development of Strell and Useless and Bailic.<br /><br />The main weakness of Hidden Truth was the explanations. There were several plot devices that worked very well, but that would have been better if they had been explained further. There were some that were confusing, and others that were explained well enough that they weren't confusing, but the reader isn't left feeling as though he or she completely understands what is being talked about either. Many of the references are deliberately vague, to conceal plot twists later in the story, but some are never explained later in the book, and that is disappointing.<br /><br />That is, however, really the only big weakness in Hidden Truth. Cook's writing flows easily and is neither too wordy nor too sparse. She does a wonderful job building a world, crafting small details that make it seem real. Though some of the details are odd, they do give the world a very genuine feel and they make the characters seem more realistic.<br /><br />Hidden Truth is a highly satisfying book, one that could almost stand on its own if it weren't for the extensive background information provided in the first book in this series. The ending is satisfying, if a bit sappy at the very end. The twists and turns continue up to the last few pages, but that doesn't stop Cook from tying up all the loose ends so admirably one might wonder what there is left to do in the other two books. The ending of Hidden Truth truly felt like the ending to the story.<br /><br />Anyone who enjoyed First Truth will enjoy Hidden Truth a lot, and those who picked it up without reading the first book will likely want to go back to fill in the details. Lovers of the fantasy genre and those new to it will all likely enjoy this book very much.nd they make the characters seem more realistic. <br /> <br />Hidden Truth is a highly satisfying book, one that could almost stand on its own if it weren't for the extensive background information provided in the first book in this series.

US	15853110	R1TSS3BM871ULT	0441008658	777040121	Spindle's End	Books	5	3	3	N	N	An absolutely delightful retelling	Spindle's End is a delightful re-telling of the Sleeping Beauty tale. For the most part, it stays true to the tale, but instead of focusing on the spell and the rescue from the deep sleep, it focuses on the princess' childhood and adolescence and how she grows up away from the palace, not knowing who she is.<br /><br />It's a fascinating take on the story, and a highly enjoyable one. The reader gets to watch Rosie (the princess) grow from a tiny infant rescued from her cradle to a self-assured young woman who knows what she wants even though she's mistaken about who she really is.<br /><br />Perhaps the most enjoyable part of Spindle's End is McKinley's take on magic and faeries. Magic is everywhere in the kingdom, permeating everything, making life very uncertain when there wasn't a faerie around to keep or set things straight. Animals and everyday objects like mugs and teakettles tend to turn into something else just when it's most inconvenient and the faeries are the ones who can stop that from happening by creating charms or using some of their own magic to control it.<br /><br />Other than their ability to control magic, however, faeries are just like anyone else and anyone can be a faerie. It tends to run in magical families, naturally, but just a little bit of magic background can make someone a faerie. Not everyone knows who the faeries are, because it isn't obvious unless they decide to be a \\"Professional Faerie\\" that makes his or her living from selling charms and the like.<br /><br />It's very different from most magical faerie-tale worlds, and it is a refreshing change from the norm.<br /><br />The plot mostly focuses on Rosie's young life and how she became the woman she was when she came into her birthright. It isn't at all as uneventful as it may sound, and even the slow parts are filled with delightful characters that make the reader want more and more. The twists from the norm fit well with the story itself and nothing seems too odd, not even the surprise at the end.<br /><br />The characterization in Spindle's End is well done when it comes to the main characters. Even though it is an ensemble, none of the main people feels neglected or flat, and several of the supporting characters were also quite well-rounded. Even several of the animals (who Rosie can talk to as a result of her faerie gifts on her name-day) are well developed.<br /><br />The problem with the characters, in particular the animals, is that there are too many of them. There is a large group of animals that plays a pivotal roll in the last part of the novel, but there are almost too many of them. It is near impossible to associate names with species of animal, much less with an individual animal and the reader may feel as though he or she needs a cheat sheet to keep them all straight.<br /><br />Other than the possible confusion with the characters, however, Spindle's End is an absolutely delightful tale that breathes fresh life into an old story and shows a completely different perspective on familiar events. Anyone who likes Sleeping Beauty, reworked faerie tales, or fantasy books will likely enjoy this wonderful tale.ven the surprise at the end. <br /> <br />The characterization in Spindle's End is well done when it comes to the main characters.

US	15853110	R20KLVY2UNV1Y5	0763618292	897518580	Witch Child	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Compelling and informative	Witch Child is the journal of Mary, a girl who flees England at 14 after her grandmother is hanged for being a witch. In danger of suffering the same fate as her guardian, Mary joins with a group of Puritans heading for America. It is not, however the place of freedom she envisioned.<br /><br />Despite his title, Witch Child does not focus on magic at all, but rather is an account of the harsh, religious life that the Puritans led in the New World. The only magic in the book is when Mary scrys. Even when the other girls in the town try to frame her, it is trickery, not magic. Other than the ability to scry, any magical abilities Mary may posses are left to the reader to determine. She never lets on one way or the other.<br /><br />Still, Witch Child is a compelling, informative read. With Mary, the reader experiences the dangerous, harsh voyage on a small, crowded ship crossing the ocean and a harsh New England winter. Mary writes about the religious zeal of the Puritans and how it governs every aspect of their lives and the littlest things made people fall under suspicion. While it is not a true account, it is, as far as I can tell, a historically accurate representation of how people lived back then and as thus, was fascinating.<br /><br />It also performed well as a story, though it was not what I had expected. It took me a while to get into it because not much other than character development was happening while they were on the ship. It was, at times, somewhat dull, but it was also very effective both for character development and writing development. It was a realistic portrayal of how a young girl trapped on a ship for months would write and it also allowed the reader to get to know Mary's fellow passengers as she did. The situation brought out both the best and the worst in people, and as such presented a fairly rounded view of most of the characters, even some of the more minor ones.<br /><br />The plot picks up once they get off the ship, and from that point Mary's journal entries became much more engrossing. The internal bickering in the town they settle in is amusing and entertaining, though at times the amount of religious fervor is overwhelming. That, however, adds to the tone of the story and makes the plot more believable.<br /><br />The only thing that I really didn't like about this book was the ending. The premise was that the reader was reading Mary's diary, and then after the last entry, the whole premise is suddenly changed without explanation. It was very jarring and didn't really make much sense, though I have been told that it is explained better in the sequel, Sorceress. I hope so, because this was an enjoyable book, but that last page just completely jarred me and really felt as though it didn't fit at all with the rest of the book. Having just read Witch Child, I personally think that the book would be better without it, but if it really does set the stage for something in Sorceress then it's a different situation.<br /><br />All in all, I think that Witch Child is a clever, creative book. Mary's journal entries are easy to read but insightful, and they tell a complete story that is informative as well as entertaining. I would recommend this book to others who like fantasy.that point Mary's journal entries became much more engrossing.

While the story has potential, it unfortunately falls flat. Most of the book is creepy, and then in the last little bit, so many horrific things happen in such a short period of time that it doesn't seem real enough to be actually frightening.<br /><br />The first three quarters of this book are relatively well done. There are just enough scary things thrown in to give the novel it's tone, and the mystery that relates to the house is interesting enough to hold the reader's attention.<br /><br />The main characters are well developed, and Angel and Seth in particular show off many different sides to their personalities in their dealings with each other and with their schoolmates. Most of the more prominent supporting characters also had enough depth that they felt real, and the ones who didn't were only needed for a bit.<br /><br />The one thing that kept the first part from being great was the teenage angst. Saul created a realistic situation with the teasing and hazing, but it got to the point that it was detracting from the creepy murder part of the story. Even the most socially awkward teenager isn't the butt of jokes all the time; the other teenagers have other things to discuss and do. It just seemed a little much that they devoted that much time to making Angel and Seth miserable.<br /><br />The last quarter of Black Creek Crossing is where the really disturbing bits began to happen, but it seemed as though everything else that had been mentioned up to that point was forgotten. Though a bit more was revealed about the witches and the mysterious cat, nothing was ever fully explained. The mystery was never solved. It was as though Saul left it hanging so he could write another book in that same setting.<br /><br />There was so much more that could have been revealed to the readers without changing the ending, but none of it was. There are so many questions at the end that it was rather dissatisfying. Was the cat good or bad? Was it trying to hurt or help Seth & Angel? Who was interfering in the lives of the people who lived in the house and why? Nothing was explained satisfactorily, not even with rumors or conjecture. There was a great build up to the mystery of what and why and possibly how, but nothing was ever satisfied.<br /><br />It appears that Saul decided to try to include that \\"little bit more\\" that many readers are looking for in his novel, but then got so caught up in the horror aspects of it that he forgot to finish the mini-plots he started and just left the readers hanging in so many areas.<br /><br />I would only recommend this book to someone who is looking for a good scare and nothing more. Everyone else is likely to come away at least a little disappointed.was rather dissatisfying. Was the cat good or bad? Was it trying to hurt or help Seth & Angel?

The plot that dominated those two books was resolved at the end of the second book, and Hidden Truth has the characters pick up with their lives and then throws unrelated challenges at them. It is really more of a sequel than part of a compact series that follows one main plotline throughout.<br /><br />In Forgotten Truth, Alissa, the main character of the Truth novels, is transported back in time approximately four hundred years to a time when the keep is thriving instead of abandoned. There, she meets Masters she has only heard about and encounters a much younger version of Lodesh, the not-quite-ghost she awakened in the second book.<br /><br />Though it does not really continue the plot of First Truth and Hidden Truth, Forgotten Truth is still engaging and something that fans of the previous two novels will likely enjoy. Here, the reader gets to see Alissa mature some and become more confident in her abilities as both human and raku. Readers are also introduced to many new characters that they will, in a way already be familiar with from the first two books as Alissa meets the students, Keepers, and Masters of the past.<br /><br />Cook does an admirable job weaving the plot, focusing mostly on Alissa and what she is learning and doing as she attempts both to find her way back to her time, but also giving time to Strell, Useless, and Lodesh as they try to figure out what happened to Alissa and how to get her back. The jumps from one time to another are never jarring, and they never leave the reader wondering too much, though they do leave some immediate things unresolved to keep interest. It is a difficult balance to maintain, and Cook does it well.<br /><br />The returning characters in Forgotten Truth have mostly reached the point where they're rather stagnant and there is little development for any of them other than Alissa. They still have the depth that they had achieved in the prior novels, but they do not change much during the course of this one. However, there are several new characters introduced, and they are all also delightfully well-rounded, dynamic characters who are a lot of fun to get to know. It is the characters that Alissa meets in the past that keeps the book from becoming simply another \\"Lost in the wrong time\\" book.<br /><br />Though the general plot has certainly been done before, Cook manages to keep it fresh and interesting through the characters and by tying all the events that Alissa experiences back into the stories and events from the previous two books. It isn't so much what happens that keeps it interesting, but more what the reader gets to see and who the reader gets to meet.<br /><br />In many ways, Forgotten Truth is better and more exciting than certainly First Truth and to some extent Hidden Truth. Anyone who enjoyed the first two books in the series will like this one and newcomers to the series won't find themselves quite as lost as they would starting with the second book, though they will miss a lot of what is being referred to.depth that they had achieved in the prior novels, but they do not change much during the course of this one.

The book is geared towards younger readers (probably about 6-10 year-olds) but it is fun enough for adults to enjoy as well.<br /><br />The plot and language of Magyk is necessarily simple, but it is nonetheless engaging. Though I was fairly certain of how it would work out in the end-and I ended up being right-there were all sorts of things along the way that I did not anticipate and in fact could not have anticipated. The little plot twists that were encountered along the way kept the book fun and interesting.<br /><br />One thing that Sage did really well was tap into what kids think about things. For example, the level of Extra-Ordinary Wizard (of which there is only one) is obtained by getting a medallion. Traditionally, it's passed down from master to apprentice, but it can be taken by someone else and then that person becomes the Extra Ordinary Wizard. There's also a cat who was turned into a duck because his owner lives in the marshes and ducks are better suited for marshes and the princess wears her circlet all the time, even to bed.<br /><br />It is things like this that add a lot of charm to Magyk.<br /><br />The characters were also delightful. Though they perhaps would have been better if they'd been slightly more developed, none of them felt flat. They all had amusing quirks that rounded out their characters and brought even more fun to the novel, like really, really liking cabbage or being obsessed with funky shoes. The \\"good guys\\" were greatly amusing and the \\"bad guys\\" were evil enough to be evil but not bad enough to scare anyone in the intended audience.<br /><br />It is, at times, obvious that it is geared towards children. For example, when one of the \\"bad guys\\" is caught, they make him think that he is an unemployed circus clown and send him of to find work rather than putting him in jail or killing him. The language is also toned down, and the adults aren't quite as grown-up as most adults are generally portrayed. (Though perhaps that is closer to real life, as most of us never really grow up. What fun would that be?)<br /><br />Still, everything is so fun that it doesn't really matter. Anyone who likes magic or fantasy and wants to have a good time will enjoy this book.<br /><br />Another thing that's important to note about Magyk is that though it is part of a series, it stands wonderfully on it's own. The conclusion was quite satisfying, and though I would like to know more about what happened to the various characters and how they continue to come into their birthrights, the conclusion was good enough that I felt like I had read a complete story. I'm anxious to read the next book when it comes out, but I don't feel like I have to in order to fully enjoy this book.quite as grown-up as most adults are generally portrayed.

This is not precisely true, but it's not precisely a lie either, so I suppose I will forgive whoever wrote the blurb for misleading me. I certainly don't regret reading the story.<br /><br />The real story in Brimstone is a bit more mundane. The murders are just murders and the things that at first appear to be indicating supernatural activity actually indicate something completely different. However, in this instance, mundane is not boring. The crimes were committed by a devilishly clever criminal with highly unusual motivations and the officers that attempt to crack the case are smart, clever, and fun to read about.<br /><br />If I were to summarize the story of Brimstone, it would likely sound like the kind of story that makes it almost impossible to suspend disbelief, but it is actually amazingly easy. Preston and Child have woven a story that is just on this side of believable. It draws the readers in with an intriguing premise and delightful characters, and keeps them there with unexpected twists and edge-of-your-seat suspense. There are points where it is difficult to put the book down.<br /><br />The two main characters, Pendergast and D'Agosta, are recurring characters of Preston's and Child's, and as such are fairly well-developed at the beginning of the book. It is obvious that the writers know their characters even if the readers don't yet, but the need to develop them for the readers is not completely ignored either. While there were things that I would have liked to have more information on about both of them, I did not ever feel that they were flat or stereotypical.<br /><br />The supporting characters were not quite as well developed, but I did feel as though most of the characters who had any significant appearance in the book were developed as far as they needed to be. Some of them seemed to be returning characters as well, as I got the impression that the authors were building on something that had been previously developed, and those were definitely not flat.<br /><br />Despite its twists and turns, the plot is solid, wrapping up the loose ends by the end of the book and avoiding obvious holes. The only potential pitfall is the conclusion, as some readers might find the way that the murders were committed to be a bit too far-fetched for their tastes. Given what was implied on the cover, however, the method seems a bit of a stretch, but not by any means unbelievable.<br /><br />The other thing that readers should be aware of is that this is a part of a series, albeit one that can stand (mostly) alone. There is no prior reading required to understand what is going on as references to events in previous books are made only in passing and do not in any way affect understanding or enjoyment of the book. The plot is also seemingly wrapped up until the hint of more to be revealed on the last page of the book that might have some readers wanting to pick up the next book, Dance of Death. It is, however, not mandatory to feel as though there was a complete story.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed Brimstone, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries and thrillers.ot the impression that the authors were building on something that had been previously developed, and those were definitely not flat.<br /><br />Despite its twists and turns, the plot is solid, wrapping up the loose ends by the end of the book and avoiding obvious holes.

McKinley's version of the Robin Hood tale does not differ much from the story that most everyone hears in some version when they are a child. There are, I am sure, a few differences, but the major events that I remember from the stories and the movies were all there. The story in The Hero and the Crown is more the story of the characters than the events.<br /><br />McKinley's Robin is a reluctant hero, forced into his situation by circumstances beyond his control. He hesitates to endanger anyone else, and though the other outlaws flock to him, he honestly doesn't want most of them there. He's more concerned with keeping the people who come to him safe and getting them started in new lives than being a hero.<br /><br />It was a different explanation of his motives than I had read before, and I found it to be interesting. Though all of the Robin Hood's I've read about wanted to keep their people safe, this one seemed more focused on it than most, going out of his way to avoid attracting attention, and only taking what they were sure they could get and actually use. It was much more complicated than simply taking from the rich and giving to the poor.<br /><br />Though I thought that this view gave Robin more depth than other Robin's I've read about, I was glad when he took on a more traditional Robin Hood role and started to take the offensive against the sheriff and his men as well. McKinley's Robin is naturally the best kind of leader, the type who puts his people before himself and makes sure everyone is cared for, but it was strange to read about Robin Hood hiding in a small, uncomfortable camp in the forest and not doing anything to right the wrongs that were occurring nearby.<br /><br />The other characters were also different from what I remembered. Most notably, Marian was much more pro-active and involved in McKinley's version than in other versions I've read. I've never viewed Marian as weak, but here she was even stronger than I had imagined. Robin as an outlaw would never have worked without this Marian, whereas in other versions, Marian is helpful, but not vital. I enjoyed seeing her in a more active role, though I can understand why there was no focus on at home, because I just can't see this Marian fitting into the life at a noble's keep.<br /><br />Other recognizable but slightly different characters included Little John and Will Scarlet.<br /><br />In addition to the interesting characters, The Outlaws of Sherwood was an engrossing tale, written in a way that though I knew basically what would happen, I was engrossed, wanting to know how McKinley's characters would react and how things would get to a certain point. The unfamiliar variations were mostly welcome, because they made sense in the view of things that was presented, and there was nothing that was so far from the familiar story that I felt jarred while reading it.<br /><br />I found this to be a fun variation on the traditional Robin Hood tale and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys that story or McKinley's other work.s an outlaw would never have worked without this Marian, whereas in other versions, Marian is helpful, but not vital.

US	15853110	R36NIZWCSUZQPJ	0446576972	670656489	Dance of Death	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Disapointing	Dance of Death picks up immediately where Brimstone left off, taking up the thread of the story that was hinted at in Brimstone but never developed, that of Diogenes' \\"perfect crime.\\"<br /><br />It's a good premise, but Dance of Death ultimately falls short of its predecessor, failing to grab and keep readers attention nearly as effectively. It wasn't boring, but there were very few unpredictable parts, and only one unexpected twist right at the very end. It is, really, a decent novel in it's own right, but it is not as good as Brimstone and most readers are likely to notice that.<br /><br />I think that the main reason for that is that in Dance of Death there is very little that isn't already known. We know who the criminal is. We know, in a general sense, who the targets are. We know why these people are the targets. Even the addition of the other crime doesn't really add too much flavor to the story.<br /><br />Granted, there are things that the readers don't know, but those are, unfortunately never revealed. For instance, why does Diogenes hate Aloysius so much? What happened between them when they were children to make him feel that way? That, I think, would be an interesting revelation, but we'll have to wait at least until the release of the next Pendergast novel to find it out. It's hinted at enough in Dance of Death to make readers curious, but despite several times that it seems as though it's going to be revealed, it never is.<br /><br />The biggest flaw in Dance of Death is its ending. While other Preston and Child novels have conclusions even as they hint at more to come, Dance of Death just seemed to end. Nothing was resolved at all. Diogenes was still on the loose. The romantic issues between Laura Haywood and D'Agosta weren't resolved. D'Agosta's fate with the NYPD is yet to be determined. Every single plot line was left open. It was as though Preston and Child just got tired of writing and decided to quit right there and pick it up in a later book when they were in the mood again.<br /><br />It was very strange.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, the plot is still relatively solid. There were several things that I wished had been wrapped up better, but there were no obvious holes, and everything that happened did make sense by the end.<br /><br />In addition, Preston and Child managed to keep the other things that make this series good intact. The characters continue to grow as we learn more about them and characters that seemed a little flat in the previous novel gained depth in Dance of Death. The writing, while not precisely spectacular, is solid and easy to read.<br /><br />It was a fairly enjoyable book, I just would have enjoyed it more if I had actually liked what happened and if things had been properly concluded rather than leaving it blatantly open for the next book in the series.r book when they were in the mood again. <br /> <br />It was very strange. <br /> <br />Despite these flaws, the plot is still relatively solid.

US	15853110	R21I2Z7TWY0FYV	0689867042	429244800	Tithe: A Modern Faerie Tale	Books	4	3	6	N	N	Good, but sparse on details	Tithe is the story of Kaye, a girl who talked to faeries until she moved to the city to travel around with her mother's rock band. When strange circumstances force her and her mother to return to the area in which Kaye grew up, she again meets her faerie friends, though this time they're not necessarily her friends.<br /><br />The story is interesting and engaging, combining teenage angst with faerie magic. The result is a fun tale that isn't precisely what we want faerie tales to be, but is all the better for it. It wouldn't be nearly as exciting if the faeries were nice.<br /><br />In Tithe, Black presents mostly typical views of the Faerie courts and the animosity between them. Despite the fact that this is a young adult novel, Black doesn't skimp on the less desirable qualities of the faeries, both Seelie and Unseelie alike. Granted, the Unseelie are worse, but the Seelie aren't sweetness and light. They're all power hungry, callous towards humans, and don't seem to care about each other all that much. They take advantage of Kaye despite being her friends because it presents a good opportunity for political maneuvering.<br /><br />It is that political maneuvering that is the weakest point of plot. The possibility isn't even revealed until about a third of the way in, and Kaye isn't completely clued in until much later. Yet, somehow, she manages to unravel a years-old plot with minimal information and only a few hours time. It seems highly unrealistic that she, who knew very little about Faerie culture, was able to figure out what the faeries themselves were unaware of. It also seemed unrealistic that the faeries would believe her on such flimsy evidence. She offered no proof of what she was saying, so it was her word versus the word of a well-established faerie. It doesn't seem right that they took the word of an outsider that readily.<br /><br />The other way I thought Tithe could be improved was by including more explanations. So many strange things were just accepted by the characters with very little disbelief and so many things were left unexplained. I know that part of that is because Black was trying to keep the novel \\"toned down\\" for the younger readers that it's geared towards, but I think that there could have been more explanations without losing the Young Adult feel of the novel. It seemed at parts that Black was using the fact that it was geared towards younger people as an excuse to not get into too much, such as the political situation of the faeries.<br /><br />The lack of details and explanation carried over into the characters as well. Though I didn't feel that any of the characters were flat, I would have liked to know all of them a little better, especially Kaye. Her reaction to the huge change she goes through is almost non-existent, as is Corny's reaction. It would have seemed more real without that. The same goes for their reaction to the death that occurs. It didn't seem like they reacted enough based on what else I knew about them.<br /><br />Still, in all other areas, the characterization was strong and clever. I loved the different faeries especially and the way they showed their allegiance (or lack thereof) to their courts. The intrigues that were only hinted at did help with the characterization by fleshing out many of the faeries who would otherwise have been rather flat.<br /><br />In addition, though the political part of the plot was questionable, I found the rest of it to be enjoyable. I think that if the faerie politics had only been as deep as they seemed until the last few pages, I would have been satisfied, for what appeared up to that point was clever enough that I was able to overlook the holes, which were for the most part, minor. It was only the end that was too unbelievable.<br /><br />All in all, Tithe is a wonderful story. It's fun, creative, and a different twist on the idea of changelings that I personally liked a lot. It will appeal to the imagination of younger readers, andthe issues above likely won't trouble them as much as it would an adult. Still, even for adults, this is an enjoyable book that I would recommend to faerie and fantasy fans.er readers, and the issues above likely won't trouble them as much as it would an adult.

US	15853110	R167XH5RKGAP7W	0312201656	477658660	I Capture the Castle	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Enjoyable	I Capture the Castle is the story of Cassandra, a 17 year old girl living in a decrepit castle in England in the 1930's. It's told through her journal entries, which she writes not so much to tell the events of the day, but more to practice her writing because her author father (who hasn't written in years) was highly critical of the last piece that she showed him.<br /><br />As the reviews on the cover of the book claim, Cassandra is a very charismatic narrator. It is difficult to dislike her, though there were several points where I did truly want to. Her excitement for things is infectious, as is the romanticism of the castle in which she lives. Her endeavors to improve her writing lead to a very interesting and sometimes moving story.<br /><br />The main problem that I had with the story was actually something that was done well. The characterization was excellent, making it very believable that it was a young woman writing about family and friends that she has known for some time. They were well fleshed-out and seemed like real people. The problem that I had was that they seemed like real people that I just didn't like and at times that detracted from my reading pleasure.<br /><br />While I did find I Capture the Castle to be enjoyable for the most part, my dislike of the characters hampered that enjoyment. I found Rose to be very shallow, as was Cassandra, and I honestly wanted to see them foiled in their quest for husbands. I have little tolerance for people who are upset about their circumstances but don't do anything to change them, so the constant moping in the Mortmain household grated on my nerves after a while. I know that it was a different time, and perhaps that was more appropriate action then, but it was annoying to see all the women there so weak and unable or unwilling to do anything to improve their situation.<br /><br />The plot was also so much based around their desires to improve their situation that I had a small bit of trouble with it as well, but it was cleverly done, and there were enough side plots that I wasn't too overwhelmed by Cassandra and Rose's attempts to improve their position through marriage.<br /><br />I did find this book to be an interesting look into a different time period. I enjoyed reading about the idiosyncrasies that Cassandra focused on, as well as things about the village life and the castle itself. I also found the attempts to get Cassandra's father to write to be highly entertaining, particularly the last way they tried. I also enjoyed the characters that, for the most part, weren't involved in the husband-fetching scheme.<br /><br />Really, Cassandra was charismatic enough that she made up for most of the flaws in the story with the way that she told it and in the end, I did enjoy the book. I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading about that time period.it as well, but it was cleverly done, and there were enough side plots that I wasn't too overwhelmed by Cassandra and Rose's attempts to improve their position through marriage. <br /> <br />I did find this book to be an interesting look into a different time period.

US	15853110	RMPN3Z5VKOJJI	037582670X	342317933	Eldest (Inheritance, Book 2)	Books	4	1	4	N	N	Good, but it could be better	The second book of the Inheritance Trilogy, Eldest picks up where Eragon left off, with Eragon and Saphria getting ready to go to the elves to further their training. It's an enjoyable book that follows Eraogn and Saphria through their training, as well as following Eragon's cousin Roran as he struggles to defend their village from the evil forces of the King. The two stories come together at the end, setting the stage for the third and final book in the trilogy.<br /><br />One thing that I noticed while reading Eldest was how heavily Paolini was influenced by the works of great fantasy artists such as J.R.R. Tolkein and David & Leigh Eddings. Everything was uniquely his own, but there were, for example, many songs included, a tactic reminiscent of Tolkein. I can't remember precisely what it was that reminded me of the Eddingses, but I do know there was something specific that did that as well. It was all very complimentary, nods to favorite authors if you will, but it was definitely more noticeable in Eldest than it was in Eragon.<br /><br />It was, however, all integrated seamlessly into the story, so unless the readers are familiar with the works of the referenced authors, they likely won't notice anything at all.<br /><br />Most of the story elements in Eldest-plot, characterization, etc.-are continued directly and seamlessly from Eragon. The characters continue to grow and develop, changing as events dictate. They all gain more depth as we learn more about them and even the minor characters who mostly hover in the background start to pick up a little more form.<br /><br />The story itself picks up directly where Eragon left off. While it can't stand alone, Eldest is a complete book, wrapping up enough sub-plots by the end that the reader feels satisfied despite the fact that there is still a whole book before the story itself is finished.<br /><br />Paolini's writing style is probably the weakest point of a very enjoyable book. Though he tells an engrossing story, he does a lot of telling rather than showing and he also includes several fantasy clich&eacute;s. I saw what happened with Murtagh coming from the very beginning of the book, though I was slightly surprised by the method. The revelation that Eragon had regarding his father at the end was also something that had definitely been done before in fantasy. It will also, naturally, be done again. It wasn't a horrible thing, but the rest of the novel was so creative that it was jarring to see something that had been done so many times before.<br /><br />It is the writing style, I think, that makes this a young adult book rather than a High Fantasy novel. The plot is certainly complex enough and I think that as Paolini himself matures he will move wonderfully into the realm of High Fantasy, if that's where he chooses to go. If he chooses not to, I think that he will continue to write excellent young adult novels. He is definitely an author that I will be following in the future.ossing story, he does a lot of telling rather than showing and he also includes several fantasy clichs.

It is enjoyable enough, but very little actually happens. It mostly feels like Cook is setting up relationships and situations for later in the series. It's necessary, but it leaves the reader wondering what, exactly, was accomplished in this book.<br /><br />The strongest point in First Truth is the characterization of the two main. Cook spends a good deal of time developing Alissa and Strell as characters individually and then more time developing their relationship with each other. They're both complex and well-rounded and they have a very believable relationship.<br /><br />The other two big characters in the book, Useless and Bailic, aren't quite as well developed, but they don't seem to be lacking either. The reader knows what Alissa and Strell know, and as they don't know too much about Useless and Bailic, the reader does not either. They're not so much flat characters as mysterious. There are definitely hints of more there than is actually revealed, but it isn't seen in this book. Perhaps Cook will develop them further in the other books of the quartet.<br /><br />The plot was relatively simple and didn't seem to actually start until about a third of the way into the book, when Alissa and Strell finally met. It was fairly solid, with no obvious holes, but it was also slow moving, and remained that way through the entire book. Things didn't ever really pick up, not even towards the end.<br /><br />That isn't to say that First Truth wasn't enjoyable, because it was, but it would have been nice if some of the things that were hinted at and set up for had happened in this book. Unfortunately, the whole book felt as though it was one big set up for things to come, like it was the first part of a much longer story. It seems as though this particular quartet is composed strictly of one long story, not one long story with several shorter stories within it. There was no shorter story that was started or concluded.<br /><br />Considering the way Cook set things up, the ending of First Truth was remarkably satisfying. It wasn't a conclusion, but it was a nice place to pause for a while before continuing on with the next part of the story. It leaves the reader curious enough about what will happen next that most will want to read the next book, but it isn't a cliffhanger that will leave readers upset if they don't have the next book right away.<br /><br />This is a promising start to the series, and if Cook continues along the lines that she has started, the entire quartet should be an enjoyable read. Anyone who likes fantasy will probably enjoy this book, though readers should be prepared to pick up at least the second book in the quartet once they finish First Truth.story, not one long story with several shorter stories within it.

US	15853110	R2ZW5ZF7WOQRRX	0877959536	680352145	Unicorn Mountain	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Surprisingly enjoyable	I found Unicorn Mountain to be an enjoyable book, but it wasn't quite what I thought it would be. Part fantasy, part more general fiction, it is a story of life and death and coming together. It's a story of conflicting cultures, of facing fears, and of finding out what really matters.<br /><br />The cover proclaims Unicorn Mountain to be a fantasy novel, but I'm not sure that's quite it's primary genre. True, there are fantasy elements, namely the unicorns, but they actually play a very small role in the novel. The other elements that could be considered fantasy are actually spiritual elements from the Ute traditions, and I personally would not dream of demeaning their religion by calling it fantasy.<br /><br />My other problem with calling this a fantasy novel is that I'm not sure which sub-genre I would put it in. It takes place in (relatively) modern times, but it's not an urban fantasy. I don't think that rural fantasy is a sub-genre.<br /><br />Personally, I think that this would best be classified as simply fiction.<br /><br />Instead of filling the book with unicorns as I had expected, Bishop uses the mystical creatures to bring his main characters together and to highlight their stories. The unicorns gave them all something to fight for and a reason to stay around each other and learn to accept each other's differences.<br /><br />Unicorn Mountain was written and set in the mid 1980's, at the beginning of the widespread AIDS epidemic in the United States, and it dealt with that in a surprisingly dignified manner, given the time period in which it was written. I thought that Bishop did an admirable job conveying Bo and the people he interacted with, covering the entire spectrum of reactions. Though it was rather obvious to me that Bo was created for that reason, I still liked the character, because he was far more than just a gay guy with AIDS, which is part of what the book was about.<br /><br />I did find the bits about people being overly upset by condoms and condom advertising to be amusing, because that was before my time, but it fits in with the timeframe and adds a little extra to the book, even if it does date it a little. In this case, though, I think that dating is good, because it will help people place the attitudes about AIDS and gays in context as well.<br /><br />The other characters were equally engaging. I particularly liked Paisley/Alma, though I wish that Bishop had spent more time with her, and that I had been able to learn more about the Ute culture and rituals through her. That I think was the one thing that I felt was really lacking element-wise from the book. I didn't feel that Sam and Paisley were developed as well as they could have been, because a lot of the Ute culture was glossed over so that I didn't really learn anything.<br /><br />Unicorn Mountain surprised me.

LeGuin's Earthsea books are hailed by many as an outstanding example of the fantasy genre. I am personally going to withhold judgment on that until I have had the opportunity to read the other two books in the original trilogy because while I enjoyed A Wizard of Earthsea I felt that there were some things missing that could have made it a much better book. My hope is that those missing pieces will be filled in by The Tombs of Atuan and The Farthest Shore and that together the three books will make one outstanding tale.<br /><br />My first thought upon finishing A Wizard of Earthsea was, \\"That's it?\\" I really felt that it was far too short. I enjoyed the story a lot, but it seemed as though I was just getting into it and things were really just beginning to happen when all of a sudden things were being wrapped up and before I knew it, the book was done.<br /><br />One thing I would like to have read about is more of the magic theory of the world. There was lots of talk about classes in magic, but nothing that gave me a glimpse into how the magic really worked. There were enough different branches and classes to imply that there is a magic theory, but it was never elaborated upon. I would also have liked to know what differentiated the wizards from the sorcerers. I know that they touched on it in the book, but I never truly understood the difference. That is definitely one thing that I hope will be expounded upon in the later books.<br /><br />Actually, I hope just about everything, including characterization, will be expounded upon in the later books. Like just about everything else in A Wizard of Earthsea, I felt that there was a good start on characterization, but that it could and should have gone a little farther for it to be truly complete. The only character I felt that I knew at all well was Ged, but there were a few, like Vetch and Ogion, who I felt as though I should have known better than I did, because they were important to Ged. In addition, I felt that the squabbles Ged had with some people would perhaps have had more meaning if I had known more about the people involved.<br /><br />The only thing that I didn't really like about A Wizard of Earthsea was was Ged's reaction to what I thought should have been a traumatic event. I felt as though the whole incident was rather pointless because it didn't really affect Ged at all. He didn't really mourn as far as I can tell, and though it was mentioned that he was upset, I didn't see any signs of Ged being more than somewhat disappointed. Perhaps that was due to the fact that I didn't know him as well as I would have liked, but it did seem odd that I was more upset than Ged was.<br /><br />Other than that, however, I found A Wizard of Earthsea to be a very enjoyable book. I wished that it was longer and that there was more to it, but that was because I was enjoying the book. I was sorry to see it end, and I'm looking forward to reading the other books in this series.n, I felt that the squabbles Ged had with some people would perhaps have had more meaning if I had known more about the people involved. <br /> <br />The only thing that I didn't really like about A Wizard of Earthsea was was Ged's reaction to what I thought should have been a traumatic event.

US	15853110	RX68YPKDY4EKA	1563890895	287740469	5: Sandman, The: A Game of You - Book V	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Another installment of a highly enjoyable series	A Game of You returns us to one of the characters we were introduced to in The Doll's House, Barbie, part of the seemingly normal couple that lived in the same house as Rose. This is an expansion of her dream in that book, a further look into the world that she dreamed, and the end of that world.<br /><br />The thing that I liked best about this book was how the characters were all somehow related to characters in earlier books. Barbie was Rose Walker's housemate. Foxglove is the ex-girlfriend of Judy, the girl who killed herself in the diner in Preludes and Nocturnes. The way everyone is connected to someone else in The Sandman, even if they appear in different volumes, helps to draw the whole story together.<br /><br />The characters in A Game of You were, in my opinion, the best thing about the book. I wasn't surprised, as this seems to be the norm for The Sandman books, but I was impressed. The characters are all so diverse, each with their own (mostly) realistic quirks. Hazel and Foxtrot were my favorites, but I enjoyed all of them, even the woman from the subway who is terrified of dogs.<br /><br />(I'm sure, however, that I'm missing something somewhere, as I know there's more to Thessaly than meets the eye. I'm just not sure what it is. Maybe I'll catch it when I re-read the series.)<br /><br />A Game of You is really about the ending of a dream, which is in a way what all The Sandman books I've read are about, but this one is a little more obvious. The actual dream in the Dreamscape is ending. The skerry on which it exists is being destroyed by the dream itself, or at least from within the dream, by something left by Barbie when she roamed it as Princess Barbara.<br /><br />It made for an interesting plot, in the dream and out of it, the two worlds mirroring each other. Most of the significant action took place in the dream, but the disastrous results were felt in the waking world much more keenly than in the dreamscape. The ones who suffered were not the ones who were causing the problem, which, of course, is what actually caused the problem to begin with, as Barbie left her younger self trapped in the dream, unable to get out.<br /><br />Full of insights and unexpected twists, A Game of You is engaging and entertaining and more. There are things, ideas, lurking beneath the surface, waiting to be let out, but it also makes a good read just for enjoyment. Like the others in the series, I will be returning to this book sometime in the future.not the ones who were causing the problem, which, of course, is what actually caused the problem to begin with, as Barbie left her younger self trapped in the dream, unable to get out. <br /> <br />Full of insights and unexpected twists, A Game of You is engaging and entertaining and more.

Unlike the previous books, Season of Mists focuses mostly on immortals (or those close to it) rather than mortals. Only one of the chapters of the book even took place on earth, and that was dealing with the dead, not the living.<br /><br />Because of this slightly different format, Season of Mists introduced a lot of rather colorful characters. Some were the relatively familiar faces of Norse, Egyptian, and Eastern gods, angels, and demons, while others were new characters, delightful and colorful in their own way. I particularly liked the contrast of Order and Chaos and, of course, the faeries, but that was a given to anyone who knows me at all.<br /><br />I promise, though, I won't dwell on them here. I love Nuala, but in Season of Mists she really plays a very small roll.<br /><br />The central plot of Season of Mists is the abandonment of Hell. Lucifer closes it, turning out all the souls, and then gives the key to Dream to do with as he will. This, naturally proves far more complicated than it originally seems.<br /><br />Most of the story is concerned with the direct repercussions of this, particularly among the (relatively) immortal creatures of mythology. The result was one of the most fun chapters I've read in a long time-the chapter where they all come and present their cases to Dream, trying to win Hell for themselves. The interactions were entertaining, and the different ways that they tried to persuade Dream to give them the key to Hell, along with their reasons for wanting it and plans for it, were as varied and entertaining as they are.<br /><br />I have to admit, that I was a little disappointed with the ultimate decision, and I wish that I could have known who Dream would have chosen if no one had interceded, but I do admit that the decision that was reached was the only one that could be reached. It did, however, raise an interesting point when Hell was given to its new owners and re-populated. I'm not sure that I agree that it's worse to be tortured to be redeemed and made a better person than it is to be tortured for no reason, but I can see how, with eternal torment, this might be the case. It is, after all, easier to bear unpleasant things if you can be righteously angry about them.<br /><br />Woven in with the main story of the \\"battle\\" for Hell, was a secondary plot line. It was, for a while, seemingly forgotten once the key to Hell was handed over to Dream, but Gaiman did not forget about it, and the conclusion to that was even more satisfying, in my opinion, than the conclusion to the main story. I was glad that Nada was not forgotten in all the distractions.<br /><br />I know that there is more to Season of Mists than I've gotten out of it, but I've only read it once and, like the other books in The Sandman, it is one that must be read multiple times in order to be fully appreciated. It is also a book I hope to return to sometime in the future.e that could be reached. It did, however, raise an interesting point when Hell was given to its new owners and re-populated.

US	15853110	RX07HOR96PHIZ	0441011934	987517519	Heroics for Beginners	Books	3	4	4	N	N	An Amusing Read	This book isn't great literature, or even a really good book, at least not in the sense that most people use to describe good books. What it is, however, is fun, amusing, and clever.<br /><br />With an interesting mix of modern and medieval views, colloquialisms, and technology, Heroics for Beginners is an interesting and amusing read. It plays off a lot of popular and common heroic/fantasy/adventure novel clich&eacute;s and is good for more than a few laughs.<br /><br />When Ancient Artifact Model 7 (the very latest in ancient artifacts) is stolen from the kingdom of Desarae, Prince Kevin Timberline (son of Eric the Cool), has to retrieve it from the Evil Overlord who stole it before it is turned into a Weapon of Mass Destruction (which is accomplished by combining it with the Diabolical Device). More importantly, he has to do this before his arch-rival, Prince Logan, manages to do the same and wins the hand of Princess Becky.<br /><br />The Evil Overlord, Lord Voltmeter, is He Who Must Be Named (don't you dare use a pronoun to refer to him), and his castle has a turnstile at the most common entrance for would be heros-the ventilation shaft.<br /><br />This is a novel that fans of light-hearted humor like Terry Pratchett's novels will most likely enjoy. It wasn't quite as entertaining as the Discworld novels, but it was amusing, and it was fun, and he's definitely an author who I would read again given the opportunity.	2005-06-11
US	15853110	R17SRKPKLV4071	0553562738	466136665	Doomsday Book	Books	4	3	7	N	N	Doomsday Book	This is one of my favorite books that I've read recently. A combination of Historical Fiction and Science Fiction, Doomsday Book is engaging, interesting, and educational.<br /><br />In the future, the secret to time travel has been discovered, but it is only used for academic purposed, for nothing can be brought back from the past. The corporations that were funding the initial endeavors lost interest and pulled their funding when they discovered that they weren't going to be able to pillage the past for it's treasures.<br /><br />Historians have a completely different perspective and they can't resist the opportunity to explore the time periods that they have been studying through books and artifacts. Mostly, they've been exploring the 20th century, for that is the only time period that they can be sure that their researchers are going to be safe, but recently the 14th century has been opened up for exploration as well.<br /><br />Kirvin, the first historian to go back to the 14th century, is excited about going and has a fairly simple job. She just has to come up with appropriate clothes and a story for why she's traveling alone. The people who are staying behind monitoring her trip, however, have much more to do and many more worries.<br /><br />The worries pan out when something goes horribly wrong, trapping Kirvin somewhere in the past, only not when she was supposed to be.<br /><br />The two storylines-the future and the past- are equally engaging and entertaining. The technology of the future contrasts with the simplicity of the past, but the events and the reactions to them are remarkably similar, despite the 700-year time difference.<br /><br />This fascinating look into what life might have been like in the past is combined with a gripping storyline, and well-developed, interesting characters that the reader comes to genuinely care about. The link between the future and the past makes everything flow despite the jumps back and forth between the time periods.<br /><br />The little details that are included about both the past and the future make both time periods come to life in vivid (or not so vivid) color. The reader feels like he or she is there, feels the terror, the worry, and the hope. It was a book I found hard to put down.<br /><br />In addition to being an engaging story, Doomsday Book also deals with the themes of hope, sacrifice, and suffering, as well as how we as human beings react to them. Even in the darkest times of the dark ages there was still hope and even in the brightest futures there is still fear and suffering. They are eternal and undying, but it is how they are reacted to that matters. Doomsday Book shows this admirably.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes Fantasy, Historical Fiction, or Science Fiction.

US	15853110	RD25MGCC6A9KW	0061020613	532931410	Witches Abroad	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Fairy Godmothers?	The \\"Witch\\" Discworld books have never been my favorites, and this was no exception. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it and thought that it was funny, but nothing about it grabbed me and made it one of my favorite Pratchett books. The reason for that is probably quite simply that the Witches just aren't my favorite characters (I'm a Watch girl), and characters are a good portion of what makes a Discworld novel.<br /><br />I do have to say, however, that this is probably my favorite of the \\"Witch\\" novels. I love the way Granny reacts when she leaves Lancre, and that provided a lot of the humor in this novel. I also found the usual bickering between Granny and Nanny to be amusing and it didn't grate on my nerves in this book as it had occasionally in other \\"Witch\\" books that I've read.<br /><br />I really liked the Pratchett twist on traditional Fairy Tales and Fairy Godmothers. He never fails to surprise me with amusing insights on and colorful twists to just about everything he writes about. &lt;u>Witches Abroad&lt;/u> was no exception.	2005-05-17

The writing was mediocre at best, the characterization bland, and there were too many plot holes to make it a really enjoyable read. I was also annoyed by the way that Sherman seemed to discard most of the faerie \\"lore\\" that has become accepted in the world at large (and by this I mean like folk-tales, not rules set forth by other fantasy writers) but she didn't really create her own either. I spent most of the book confused about the societies of the faerie creatures.<br /><br />The potential for a good story was there, but the ideas, characters, and world needed to be better developed for it to work well. I would only recommend this book to Sherman fans	2005-05-17
US	15853110	R2ETHPSRVQVF5E	0345417623	786105285	Timeline	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Decent, for what it is	I found this book to be a lot like the movie-nothing spectacular, but fun and enjoyable if you take everything at face value. The pseudo-science won't stand up to much scrutiny, and while the history will probably do a little better, I'm sure it too is flawed. However, I didn't read this book for a science lesson or a history lesson. I read it to be entertained, and it did a good job of that.<br /><br />True, there are quite a few plot holes, but I was able to overlook them and just enjoy the book and the adventures the characters were having. Anyone looking for realism or a strong plot will probably not enjoy this book, but I enjoyed it for what it was and didn't expect too much from it.	2005-05-17
US	15853110	R3PQ3HJUXODY1N	0061007188	583740178	The Undine	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Mediocre at best	This is another book that I got because I really love faeries and other fantasy creatures. It was definitely not what I expected. The plot focused a lot on the humans rather than the Undines, and as a result, I really wasn't sure whose side I should be on. Part of me wanted to root for the Undines, as they were being ripped from their homes and rather unfairly persecuted, but mostly I was given the human's point of view, and I could see how they wouldn't want the Undines around. The Undines were really giving back as good as they got.<br /><br />There was also an over-abundance of characters and conspiracies. It made it difficult to follow at times, and I never really got attached to any one character or group of characters. I felt as though I didn't really know any of them, which made it difficult to tell.<br /><br />One thing that surprised me was the lack of eroticism. There was some, but not as much as I expected given the back, and a lot of it was very vague. Given that I wasn't really impressed with anything else, however, that might have been for the best.	2005-05-17

Of course, it was supposed to be cheesy, at least in parts, as it was a combination fantasy novel and spoof on old Private-Eye novels. I think that it did remarkably well in the spoof factor, but the fantasy factor fell a little short.<br /><br />As a Private-Eye spoof, it got just about everything right, all the way down to the twist at the end about the crime and who done it. It was so easy to see Mallory walking around in a trench coat and hat like the old Dicks of the 1920s.<br /><br />As a fantasy novel, it did all right, but I think that at times Resnick was trying too hard. There were a lot of things that were squeezed in for no apparent reason other than to make the world seem more \\"fantasy-like,\\" but I think that it would have been better had the differences between the two New Yorks been more subtle for the most part. Then the major differences would have been bigger surprises and would have been more effective.<br /><br />Probably the best part of this book was the characters. I wouldn't say that any of them were spectacularly well-developed, but they were definitely interesting. I liked how Resnick included little quirks for each of them. They were all memorable, even the ones that I knew next to nothing about, which unfortunately were most of them. Really, I didn't even know that much about Mallory by the end of the book.<br /><br />All in all, I found this book to be enjoyable, but nothing spectacular.	2005-05-17

It stood on it's own rather well, but there were a few things that I didn't understand as well as I think I could have if I'd read the other books.<br /><br />The only thing that really bothered me about this book was the name of the Sorceress. Jill just didn't fit in with the other names in the book, and the excuse that was given wasn't a very good one, or at least it wasn't to someone who had only read that book. It was alluded that there might have been a better explanation in another book, something to do with who her father was, but it was not satisfactory to me.<br /><br />I did, however, find the characters to be vibrant and the plot to be engaging, so that little complaint really isn't much of a complaint at all. This was, I thought, a rather decent fantasy novel and if I stumble across more of her work, I will likely pick it up.	2005-05-17
US	15853110	R17YYMGFII0IT6	0345347676	931027453	Camber of Culdi, Volume 1: In the Legends of Camber of Culdi	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Good, but not flawless	I have to admit that I was a little nervous when I started reading this book. One of the things that drew me into the other Deryni books that I've read was the characters, but this book is the start of the prequels to the two series that I've already read, and is set approximately two hundred years earlier. It involves a whole different set of characters, most of whom I had never heard of and those that I had were only legends in the books I had already read. Would they be able to draw me in the way the characters in the other books had? What if I didn't like them? Would I be able to enjoy this book as much as I had enjoyed the other series that I had read?<br /><br />Fortunately, my fears were unfounded. The characters in Camber of Culdi drew me in perhaps even more rapidly than the ones in the other Deryni novels I'd read. In particular, I liked Evaine, and not just because she represents a group that seems to be lacking in most fantasy novels-strong females. That was, of course, part of it, but I also found her to be an endearing character in her own right.<br /><br />Most of the other characters were similarly endearing, though Evaine was my favorite, which really drew me into the book. It only took a few chapters for me to genuinely care about what happened to these people.<br /><br />I will, however, admit that most of the characterization was not terribly complex. It seemed that the bad guys were bad and the good guys were good and there is only one character that I can think of off the top of my head that was really a mixture, only one that I couldn't tell if I was supposed to like or not. I found that to be a little disturbing, because while generally a person is predominately good or evil, most people do have some demeaning or redeeming qualities, and I found those to be far and few between.<br /><br />One thing in the book that I have very mixed feelings about is the use of magic. On the one hand, I enjoyed seeing the spells that were only legend in Kelson's time actually be used, but on the other hand the integration of magic with the Church was even stronger here than in the books that take place later, and I found that to be a bit disturbing. The Church in this world is a Christian Church, basically the Catholic Church, though it's never actually called Catholic, and it was disturbing to have Christian Saints invoked for magical spells. I'm not a practicing Christian, but I was raised Christian, and I can definitely see how this would be disturbing to someone who was a practicing Christian.<br /><br />However, I do think that the inclusion of the Church made the world seem more real. Religion does play a big roll in the lives of many people and so many fantasy writers completely ignore it. I liked the added realism and the similarities with an existing religion did make it easier to relate to than some completely made-up religion.<br /><br />I thought that the plot of this book, while enjoyable, was its weakest point. There were several things that just happened too easily for me to readily accept them and there were a few rather obvious holes in the plot as well. It wasn't anything that ruined the book, but there were places that left me wondering why or how and other places that just seemed too easy, but never turned out to be that way. It seemed that the Deryni magic, though well done in terms of how it worked, was fallen back upon a little too often and just made a few things a little too simple to accomplish.<br /><br />Still, I thought that the characters more than made up for that lack, keeping me interested in reading even through the jarring plot moments because I truly did want to know what happened to them and how things worked out in the end.in Kelson's time actually be used, but on the other hand the integration of magic with the Church was even stronger here than in the books that take place later, and I found that to be a bit disturbing.

It poked fun at everything from the competition between email and regular mail to the Post Office's motto to deliver no matter what (well, almost no matter what) to people's obsession with collecting stamps (or pins or anything else that seems strange to most \\"normal\\" people) to the animosity between dogs and postmen to herbal remedies to the dangers of monopolies.<br /><br />I giggled aloud several times while reading this book, and it definitely ranks up there in the list of my favorite Discworld novels. It's not my favorite (it couldn't possibly be without starring Susan or Vimes or any other recurring characters except the Patrician and a passing reference to Lady Sibyl), but it does rank up there. It's one that I'll be reading again.<br /><br />Pratchett exhibits his usual wit and sarcasm regarding just about everything and the end result is an entertaining look into the world of the Postal Delivery System, at least as it exists on Discworld (which, as we all know, is nothing like the real world).<br /><br />The newest character to be introduced, Moist, is entertaining, and someone I hope we see again, perhaps as one of his other personas, who all seem entertaining as well. I think it would be interesting to see him actually interact with the watch, particularly with Sergeant Angua, who would have to know that the \\"different\\" people are really all the same person.<br /><br />The one thing that disappointed me about this book was the lack of footnotes. There were a few, but not a lot, and they are often my favorite parts of the Discworld books.<br /><br />Still, it was a very funny, very enjoyable book that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys the Discworld series.	2005-04-25
US	15853110	R1M2CP8SEL2PZP	0441627404	52422715	The Once and Future King	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Good, but not great	Overall, I enjoyed this story. It wasn't a book that drew me in and made me not want to put it down like a lot of fantasy novels do, but I'm not sure if that's because I know the story (at least, most of it), or the writing style, or what. It was probably a combination of the above things.<br /><br />The one thing that I really didn't like is T.H. White's tendency to veer off onto what, for lack of a better phrase, I'll call social commentary. For example, in the last book of The Once and Future King, a chapter started out with Lancelot and Guinevere sitting in the castle looking out a window at the landscape. White then goes on to describe not only the landscape, but also the kinds of people one might see riding by and why, and then branches off into explaining other aspects of the society upon which they were looking. The whole chapter, except for the first paragraph, was this commentary and description.<br /><br />White does this throughout the whole story. At the beginning of the novel, in the first two books, I found it interesting and enlightening, especially since the society that is being described is very different from the one that we live in today, but by the end of the fourth book, I was ready for it to move on and get along with the story.<br /><br />I liked the story, but I knew that I would like the story. I've read and heard the Legend of King Arthur many times in many different forms, and I've almost always enjoyed it, so I wasn't worried about not liking the story. The more I think about it though, the more I think that I didn't really like many aspects of the novel other than the story.<br /><br />I did enjoy some of the characters, the strong ones, but there really weren't too many strong characters. Granted, I didn't expect every character introduced to be strong and well-developed, no one can do that unless there are only a very few characters in the novel.

US	15853110	R2F1PJFCNZTDEK	0060987103	816790174	Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West	Books	4	2	6	N	N	A New Twist on a Classic Favorite	I enjoyed this book a lot. It was fun and interesting to see a different perspective on the familiar story of The Wizard of Oz. I've always enjoyed stories where an author gives a different perspective and twists to a familiar story, but keeps the story the same. I think that Gregory Maguire succeeded admirably here.<br /><br />Wicked was hard to get in to as the first chapter starts out before Elphaba was born, and focuses on the religious upheaval in Munchkinland, which, while important to the story, was, in my opinion, a little over done at times, particularly towards the beginning of the book. It went more to explain the attitudes of Elphaba's parents rather than how it affected her, though I suppose the attitudes of her parents did affect her outlook on life.<br /><br />I really started enjoying the book once Elphaba got to Schiz and met Galinda (later Glinda). Galinda was a wonderful character and it amused me greatly to see her as a spoiled child rather than as the kind soul she was portrayed as in Baum's books. Of course, she did grow up, but it was still amusing, and realistic, to see her as something other than the practically perfect being Baum has her as.<br /><br />I liked the story of the shoes too, how they were made specially for Nessarose and then enchanted by Glinda to give Nessa the ability to walk without help. I think they, more than anything else, are what made Elphaba into the Wicked Witch. She was shunned her whole life because of her deformity (the green skin), while Nessarose, her sister, was embraced and loved and helped along because of hers (the lack of arms). When Glinda gave the shoes to Dorothy, it was the last straw. Elphaba felt that they should have been hers to begin with, but they were given to her sister, and then to Dorothy, the girl who killed her sister, however inadvertently.<br /><br />The whole book made it very easy to see how the Wicked Witch of the West could simply be misunderstood, rather than truly wicked. She tried to do what she could to help the Animals, she tried to help her sister, she tried to help the family of Fizero, but everything backfired on her. Everything ended in a mess that harmed more people than it helped. Eventually, and quite understandably, Elphaba became rather bitter.<br /><br />There were parts of the story that I didn't like, however. I thought the religion was over done. Though it was used to explain Frix's attitude towards his daughter, and Nessarose's \\"calling\\" and attitude towards the Munchkins, there were parts that seemed to go on forever about who believed what and why, and it got tedious.<br /><br />I also didn't really like the portrayal of the Wizard. In Baum's book, the Wizard is a kindhearted man who's afraid of what he's done and a little lost because of where he is. He was thrust into power that he didn't want because of how he arrived in Oz. In Wicked, the Wizard is power-hungry, and attempting to suppress a class of \\"people\\" (Animals). While I could see how it fit into the story and why Elphaba would see him the way she did, I still didn't like it. I wanted him to be the misguided but generally kindly man that I remembered from the Oz books, which I read again and again and again in my childhood. (My mother had the whole collection in hardback. I should see if she still has it. I want them.)<br /><br />Still, all in all, I found it to be an extremely enjoyable book and I would highly recommend it.e tried to do what she could to help the Animals, she tried to help her sister, she tried to help the family of Fizero, but everything backfired on her.

I enjoy Science Fiction on occasion, but I prefer fantasy and when I read Science Fiction, I usually read the fantastical future variety. This is a book that I never would have even picked up off the bookshelf much less bought if it hadn't been one of the books of the month in one of my book clubs.<br /><br />I am, however, very glad that I did. While it's not what I normally read, it was interesting and engaging, and I found myself anxious to read more and unwilling to put it down.<br /><br />Canticle for Leibowitz is divided up into three sections, each one dealing with a different part of history, each a turning point in the circumstances at the Abbey of Saint Leibowitz. The first part is only a few hundred years after the destruction of civilization, when mankind is back in the dark era. The second is the renaissance when things are being rediscovered, and the last is when technology has again reached the point it had reached before the last nuclear destruction.<br /><br />The second part was my favorite, though my favorite character was Brother Francis from the first part. The third part was my least favorite all around, likely because it was the most depressing. The beginning and middle were full of hope, desperate hope, but hope nonetheless, and the end made the destruction of humanity seem inevitable, which wasn't pleasant to read.<br /><br />Each part was confusing at first, as they all started in the middle of something, but once I was able to figure out what was going on (usually after a few pages), I got into it a lot. The characters were engaging and well developed and Miller made me care about what happened to them.<br /><br />One thing that I really liked about the book was the symmetry. Each part began in the middle of some insignificant task that lead to something greater, and each part ended with a death and circling buzzards and the passage of a lot of time. It gave finality to each part and kept them separate, yet at the same time linked them together.<br /><br />While I was disappointed by the ending (I had wanted things to end on a more hopeful note than they did), I think that the story accomplished what it had set out to accomplish-show the reader what things would be like if the world continued the way it was going. It was written in 1959, back when nuclear bombs were being developed at terrific paces, and it was obviously a commentary on that. I'm not sure how much it managed to change things, but it was a well-done social commentary and one that was pleasant to read at that. Some of the things could still be applied to today, though with the Cold War over, it's not quite as urgent as it must have seemed to Miller then. I'm very interested to see how he deals with the world situation that was presenting himself when he wrote the sequel 40 years after the original.gave finality to each part and kept them separate, yet at the same time linked them together. <br /> <br />While I was disappointed by the ending (I had wanted things to end on a more hopeful note than they did), I think that the story accomplished what it had set out to accomplish-show the reader what things would be like if the world continued the way it was going.

US	15853110	R8TNZ6NA7V86G	0380789019	511174865	Neverwhere	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Delightful Fun	I read this book in two sittings, and the only reason I didn't read it in one is because I had to go to work before I had finished it. It was a fun book, a fairly light read in my opinion, but something that I enjoyed.<br /><br />The one issue that I had with this book is the descriptions. Some of the descriptions were very detailed, like of the floating market, but some of them, particularly the tube stations and trains, weren't as detailed, and that made it harder for me to imagine those things. Also, a lot of the buildings weren't described too well. I don't think it was something intentional on Gaiman's part, just that he knows those buildings and tube tunnels and trains very well, and so he assumes unconsciously that everyone else does too. Unfortunately, that's not true.<br /><br />I suppose I could have done some research online and found pictures, but I don't like stopping in the middle of something to do that, especially when I'm curled up in bed all warm and comfortable. Getting up to figure out what a building looks like isn't a high priority.<br /><br />Still, it didn't distract from the book too much. I actually find it hard to believe that I'm complaining about the lack of descriptions, because I'd much rather have plot than description, but you do need some, and I don't think that some areas quite got there.<br /><br />Other areas, however, were wonderfully described and places like the floating market and Down Street became the real stars of the book.<br /><br />One thing I really liked about the book was the characterization. The people from London Above were very one-dimensional (except Richard), but the people from London Below weren't, even the ones who were only met briefly. They all had their little quirks and idiosyncrasies that made them who they were, and made them denizens of London Below.<br /><br />I especially liked how, except for Croup and Vandemar, you couldn't really tell until the end (and sometimes not even then) who was a \\"good guy\\" and who was a \\"bad guy\\". Everyone seemed flawed, and everyone was suspect (to me at least) at some point in the book. Even those people who were obviously trying to help Richard and Door weren't very altruistic in their motives. Everyone wanted something before they would do anything at all and then the methods that they used to accomplish supposedly good things weren't always the most moral way to do them. Even after finishing the book, I'm still not sure how I'm supposed to feel about some of the characters.<br /><br />Croup and Vandemar, however, were delightful villains. You knew that anyone who would employ them had to be a terrible being, but since it wasn't made known until almost the end of the book who that was, you mostly focused on them and their devilishly creative and painfully fun ways of maiming, torturing and killing. They contrasted perfectly-Croup's tendency to appreciate the finer things in life (though not the way most people appreciate them) and his excess verbiage set off Vandemar's impatience, silence, and need for action wonderfully.<br /><br />This isn't a book that I would read for plot alone, because the plot itself isn't that strong. This isn't to say that it wasn't a good plot, because it was, but the places and the characters stole the show. If the imaginary people and places that Gaiman created hadn't been so vibrant and entertaining, I think the book might have fallen through the same cracks that lead to London Below.<br /><br />Still, the plot was engaging enough to keep me interested, I'm just not sure how much I would have enjoyed the book if it hadn't been for the people and places in it.<br /><br />As I read the book, I felt more and more like Richard did-that the world of London Below was more real than London Above. It was a different world, and one that I wouldn't want to live in, but despite the darkness and dankness and impossible magic, it seemed more alive and more real than London Above. It almost seemed that the reason the people of London Above couldn't see the people of London Below unless they were directly addressed was that they were looking so hard at what they wanted to be there that really wasn't, they couldn't see what really was there.<br /><br />Maybe we all do that sometimes.eemed that the reason the people of London Above couldn't see the people of London Below unless they were directly addressed was that they were looking so hard at what they wanted to be there that really wasn't, they couldn't see what really was there. <br /> <br />Maybe we all do that sometimes.	2005-04-25

While Wicked added depth to The Wizard of Oz and especially the characters of Elphaba (the Witch of the West), Nessarose (the Witch of the East) and Galinda/Glinda (the witch of the North), Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister bore minimal resemblance to the tale of Cinderella and I had to look hard for many of the connections.<br /><br />I think that had Confessions been a stand-alone novel, with no claims to being a retelling of Cinderella, I might have enjoyed it more. I kept waiting for things that I remembered from Cinderella to happen, like the death of Cinderella's father, but they never did. Some things were the same, like the ball and the slipper that the Prince came to find the owner for, but most of it was different.<br /><br />I expected differences; after all, it is from a different perspective. However, I didn't expect them to be so vast and so difficult to tie into the story that it is supposedly based on.<br /><br />I think that part of the problem that I had with the book was that it was written in the present tense. All but the prologue and epilogue (which were in the first person) were written in third person, and the third person present tense is difficult for me to read. It was very strange, though it did make sense at the end when you found out who was telling the story. It wasn't who I expected, so that was a surprise, and it put some things into perspective, because the way the story was told was much more typical of Ruth than of Iris.<br /><br />Still, despite the fact that it does fit her character, it was disconcerting.<br /><br />The tale itself was interesting and engaging once I managed to get beyond the disturbing style, but it didn't really relate much to Cinderella until the very last part, and even then, there were parts that were distinctly different and that I couldn't reconcile with the story of Cinderella that I know.<br /><br />I think I might have enjoyed it more if I hadn't expected to be able to better relate it to Cinderella and also if I hadn't read it immediately after Wicked, because comparisons were inevitable, and Confessions fell short every time.ow. <br /> <br />I think I might have enjoyed it more if I hadn't expected to be able to better relate it to Cinderella and also if I hadn't read it immediately after Wicked, because comparisons were inevitable, and Confessions fell short every time.	2005-04-25

I've read other books by Holly Lisle before and while I wouldn't classify any of them as brutal, I would classify them as dark, and I could easily see how she might cross over that line. It is, after all, but a short step from dark to brutal.<br /><br />I suppose that, in a way, she was right. There were parts that, taken on their own, I would likely classify as brutal, but I don't think that the book as a whole qualifies. It is, however, definitely a dark fantasy; one in which no excuses are made and evil is given almost as much attention as good. This is not a typical fantasy book.<br /><br />I think, though, that is a lot of its appeal. It was almost refreshing to read a book that was unapologetically dark, one that did not necessarily offer hope of a brighter tomorrow. It certainly isn't the type of book I would want to read all the time, but it did make a nice change of pace from my normal reading habits.<br /><br />In &lt;u>Diplomacy of Wolves&lt;/u>, Lisle weaves a world full of forbidden magic and intrigue, yet one with so much detail and thought that it seems real. Lisle is a talented world-builder, creating a believable place with many cultures and a solid history. Into it, she puts well-developed characters involved in complex, detailed plot that draws the reader in.<br /><br />All in all, I would say that &lt;u>Diplomacy of Wolves&lt;/u> is a very strong, well-written book.<br /><br />The one thing that I had a problem with was part of the characterization of Kait, one of the main characters. For the most part, she is well-developed, with both flaws and strengths, and is actually a rather likeable character. However, in her interactions with one other character, she fails to notice obvious slip-ups that someone with her background wouldn't miss. These were the kind of slip-ups that were designed to let the reader know something that the characters weren't supposed to know yet, but they were so glaringly obvious that I found it annoying. Not only was the information conveyed in a poor manner, but it also diminished the characterization of the main character in the book. I can easily think of a few other ways to convey the needed information to the readers that wouldn't have gone against established character traits.<br /><br />Other than the few slip-ups dealing with that particular information, the rest of the characterization was strong and well-done. In the layers of intrigue, the characters were not always aware of the truth about each other, but Lisle still managed to convey motivation to the readers, even when the characters themselves weren't fully aware of it.<br /><br />I found the plot to be similarly strong, with several different layers intertwining, yet easy enough to follow and, with the exception of the before-mentioned incident, surprisingly lacking in holes. Given the complexity of the plot, I would have expected more things to slip by Lisle and I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was nothing else that really bothered me or felt as though it was missing.<br /><br />The world Lisle created in &lt;u>Diplomacy of Wolves&lt;/u> may be dark, but it's intriguing, and I for one cannot wait to read more.ow something that the characters weren't supposed to know yet, but they were so glaringly obvious that I found it annoying.

US	15853110	R19R60W7JA68PY	0451456912	440459606	Cursed Towers (Witches of Eileanan)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A Solid continuation of the series	When I started reading these books, I was slightly worried that they'd blend together and I wouldn't be able to come up with separate comments on the individual books rather than the series as a whole. Fortunately, Forsyth has encorporated enough ideas that the books aren't really running together. I'm a little hazy at times on where one book ends and the next begins, but it's easy enough to flip to the back of the book and check. Each book is semi-independent of the others in that they do all continue the same story, but they have their own rising action, conflict, and resolution.<br /><br />The first two books in the series dealt with restoring Lachlan to the throne of Eileanan, overthrowing Maya, the half-Fairge witch who ensnared his brother, the current, dying King, and has been forcing her will on the land. The Cursed Towers picks up after that, dealing with the other problems that plague Eileanan: the remaining supporters of Maya who want to put her daughter on the throne with her as regent, the Fairge who want to eradicate the humans from the land that they consider to be theirs, the mistrust and persecution of the Faerie races, and the Bright Soldiers coming in from the one area of Eileanan that never swore fealty to the King.<br /><br />Of course, it doesn't deal with that all at once. All the problems are there, and they affect the actions of the characters, but only one issue can be handled at a time, and they're not all handled in this book. After all, there are three more books in the series.<br /><br />I liked how this book divided the main characters not just with distance but also in the matter of their views. The conflicts between the various \\"good guys\\" added to the complexity and depth of the novel. I especially liked how Isabeau journeyed off on her own again to find herself, so to speak. Towards the end of the second book and definitely at the beginning of this book, I felt that she was becoming submerged in the fight to right the wrongs in Eileanan and also in her twin sister. I would have hated for Iseult and Isabeau to become mere extensions of each other rather than separate people with vastly different personalities, and I'm glad the Forsyth prevented that from happening. I also liked how she did it, because it was obvious that Iseult was the dominant twin personality-wise, and it wouldn't have seemed right if Isabeau had been able to resist the pull, especially given her emotional state. I thought the way it was worked was quite realistic.<br /><br />Other than the dialect, which continues to grate on my nerves at times, the one thing that really bothered me about the book was just a tiny nit-picking detail. Lachlan's wings are the result of a spell that was cast upon him, transforming him into a blackbird. The Witches were never able to fully transform him back, and he was left with the wings. However, since they are the result of a magic spell, it doesn't seem to me that they could be passed to his child. There isn't anything in his genetic code that gives him wings; it's the result of magic. Still, the baby has wings as well. I'm sure that Forsyth came up with the baby's wings logically, but I didn't see it and that bothered me slightly.<br /><br />Still, other than that I really enjoyed the book.

Of course, I've thoroughly enjoyed every Discworld book except the very first, so that wasn't very surprising. However, one thing that made this book especially enjoyable is that it is the introduction of one of my favorite recurring characters, Angua.<br /><br />Men at Arms is a Watch book, and I always particularly enjoy them because the Watch is full of such colorful characters. In this book we are also introduced to Detruis, the troll who's really smart when it's cold and really stupid when it's hot. Unfortunately, Ank-Morpork is almost always hot.<br /><br />As usual for Discworld novels, Men at Arms is full of satire, poking fun at everything from monarchy to violence to racism (or in this case, specism). The thought \\"Guns don't kill people; people kill people\\" is turned on its head when the gonne takes over the mind of it's wielder, making him kill people at random. It talks to whoever is holding it and even fires itself on occasion.<br /><br />The book starts out with new recruits to the watch being trained. Cuddy (a Dwarf), Detrius (a Troll), and Angua (both Werewolf and a woman) provide comic relief throughout the book as they attempt to adjust to the different procedures of the Night Watch.<br /><br />The real story, however, is the gonne that has gone missing just a day before Captain Vimes is scheduled to retire (he's marrying Lady Sibyl). Of course, Vimes has to find the gun and the culprit who is using it. Vetinari tells him not to, but that only makes him more determined. After all, he is a policeman; solving crimes is his job.<br /><br />As with all Discworld books, the best part of Men at Arms is the characters rather than the story. The story itself is all right, but it is the crazy character-extremely literal and valiant Carrot, hulking and slow Detrius, very odd but strangely loveable Nobby, Gaspode the talking dog, and stubborn and determined Vimes-that make the story. Without them, it wouldn't be nearly as funny or enjoyable.<br /><br />Pratchett has a knack for weaving stereotypes into believable, loveable characters, and it shows in this book. Carrot, the long lost king, is brave, valiant, noble, and honest. However, he's also managing to adapt to life in Ank-Morpork. While he doesn't lie, he doesn't ever tell the whole truth. Detrius is big and slow and stupid, but get him in cold weather and he's extremely smart. Every main character personifies a stereotype and then takes it further, turning it around and making it real and comical.<br /><br />This is definitely one of Pratchett's more amusing books. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a humorous read and all Pratchett fans.or enjoyable.<br /><br />Pratchett has a knack for weaving stereotypes into believable, loveable characters, and it shows in this book.

I liked the story itself well enough, but there were a few things that bothered me about the book and made it a little difficult to read. The first and most minor was that Meghan's familiar, Gitâ, is a donbeag, an imaginary creature, and isn't described well at all. All I know about the donbeag is that it's tiny and furry. I found this annoying because it made it very difficult to imagine. All the other creatures that were mentioned in the book were either described or creatures that really exist or standard fantasy creatures, such as dragons. The fact that Gitâ was the most mentioned and the only one I couldn't imagine annoyed me.<br /><br />The main thing that bothered me, though, is the way that the characters talked. I am against writing in dialect unless a character is either talking in a significantly different manner than they normally talk or talks in a significantly different manner than all the rest of the characters. All the characters in Witches of Eileanan talk in a Celtic-type dialect, and Forsyth writes it all in. Know is ken, not is no', of is o', you is ye, cannot is cannae, etc. If it were just one character that spoke like that, it would be fine, but they all do. I think it would have been much more readable if she had just mentioned the accent occasionally and perhaps put in a few words here and there that were exceptionally different. I managed to figure out the dialect after a while, but until I did, it gave me a headache trying to read it. Even now, I think that it detracts from the story because I had to think about it more than I did the rest of the story.<br /><br />Still, if I put that aside, I did find the story to be enjoyable. I thought that both plot and characterization were well-developed and complex. The main characters all had layers to their personalities and believable strengths and faults. The plot encompassed many different people, each with his or her own goal, though some were working together to a common end. The different elements and movements, including the \\"bad guys\\" are given consideration, and the reader is able to get glimpses into everyone's schemes and plans.<br /><br />Another thing that I really liked is that the way the book ended. While it is obvious that it is part of a series, things were wrapped up enough for this part that if I hadn't had the second book on hand, I wouldn't have been irritated. I hate picking up a book to find out that it is part of a series and the ending is abrupt and sudden with no real conclusion. I prefer series where the books can stand on their own and I can read the series backwards if I want and not be too confused. Witches of Eileanan doesn't go quite that far, but it also doesn't leave the reader hanging, which I appreciate. There's nothing worse than discovering that a book you're reading doesn't even conclude part of the story.<br /><br />All in all, I thought that Witches of Eileanan was a good book, though I think it would have been better had the dialect not been written in. Still, I thought the story was worth stumbling past the dialect.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun, relatively complex fantasy novel and doesn't mind dialect being written in.any different people, each with his or her own goal, though some were working together to a common end.

While I was anxious to find out about what Isabeau was doing during the events in The Forbidden Land, I was concerned that this book, like its predecessor, leaving me wondering still what some of the others were doing.<br /><br />I was pleased to discover that wasn't the case.<br /><br />The book flowed smoothly, covering Isabeau's actions during the time period of The Forbidden Land in the first part, and then returning to the familiar style of the first three books. It flipped smoothly between the military campaign and the intrigue at the palace, allowing the reader to focus on all of the pertinent things.<br /><br />The main problem that I had with this book was that, after Isabeau's adventure on the Skull of the World, this book felt a lot like the third book in the series. While the enemy that was being fought was different and the reason behind Isabeau's sudden departure was to retrieve children rather than take them away, the big details were almost the same. Yes, they were in a different part of the land and issues that they had to face were different, but it was much of the same.<br /><br />Still, I found it to be an enjoyable read, if not something completely new and unexpected.<br /><br />The thing that I most enjoyed about this book was Isabeau's time on the Spine of the World and her journey to the Skull of the World. The glimpses that I got into the culture of the Khan'cohbans were delightful as it was vastly different from any of the other cultures in the book. I had enjoyed the few glimpses I had gotten in previous books, but this went into much more detail and I really enjoyed reading about them.<br /><br />Isabeau's journey was also wonderful to read. It was a good mix of magic and realism and I particularly enjoyed her finding her new power. That was simply fun.<br /><br />As with the other books in the series, the characterization and world building is strong in The Skull of the World. The complexity of the different species of Faeries on this world is delightful and I like how Forsyth mixes familiar with unfamiliar to populate the world she created.<br /><br />Again, I wished for a map, but the story was engaging enough that the lack of one didn't detract from my enjoyment too much.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed the other books in this series.s, the characterization and world building is strong in The Skull of the World.

I expected a continuation of the story that I had read thus far in the first three books in this series, something along the same lines of what I had already read. While this did continue the story, it was different from what I was expecting, focusing on one character, Finn, rather than on all of them.<br /><br />As I read the story, I got caught up in what was happening, but at the beginning of the book, it felt a little bit like a cop out. I couldn't help but feeling that Forsyth knew she needed to wrap up the other lose ends that she had left open, but that she wasn't sure how she wanted to do most of it, so she just focused on one thing, one small set of characters. It was a little frustrating.<br /><br />The author's note in the back of the book assures readers that Isabeau will return in the next novel, which takes place at the same time as this book. I can't help but wonder why, if they're taking place at the same time, it wasn't interspersed in one (or two) books, moving between the story lines, as she had done in the first three books.<br /><br />I think that the one thing that saved this book for me was that it focused on Finn, who was my favorite minor character in books two and three. I was glad to see her get a bigger roll and I enjoyed learning more about her. That made it more bearable to have to wait to find out what was happening with Isabeau, Iseult, and Lachlan.<br /><br />Because of the single-minded focus on one storyline, ignoring the other things that I knew had to be happening at the same time, this is my least favorite of the books in this series thus far.<br /><br />The other problem that I had with this book was the lack of a map in the front. I wanted one with the other books in the series too, but this one focuses on them traveling and I was so confused as to where they were going, or even what direction they were going. I kept trying to picture where the various mentioned mountain ranges, seas, marshes, etc. were, but I was unable to, and it was frustrating. I'm a big believer in having maps in all books that are set on imaginary worlds.<br /><br />That said, there were things about this book that I liked. As I said above, I enjoyed the further development of Finn as a character. I also liked a lot of the other characters, and how it was shown that the Fairgean weren't just the evil, scheming faeries that they had been made out to be. I loved learning more about the Nix. I liked how some of the other characters grew in power and discovered what they were capable of doing.<br /><br />By the end, I was satisfied with the story and how it related to the rest of the series when some of the other characters made an appearance at the end of the book. I can sort-of see Forsyth's logic in focusing just on Finn's story, because it was complicated and involved a lot of traveling and character development. Perhaps interweaving the other storyline with it would have made things unnecessarily complicated. Still, I felt a little cheated that I didn't get to read about some of the other characters that I had grown to love.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the first three books in the series.ntain ranges, seas, marshes, etc. were, but I was unable to, and it was frustrating.

The problem with that theory is that wouldn't really be a review. That would be me raving about the book, and while that's all well and good, that's not what I want to do.<br /><br />So, just so I can get it over with, let's start with what I didn't like about War for the Oaks.<br /><br />The first thing that comes to mind is that I really wanted to know what the Pookah's name was, but that's really just me nit-picking.<br /><br />I guess the main thing that I had a problem with was some of the characterization. Yes, the main characters were characterized well, but I felt that there was room for improvement with the characterization of some of the band members. Bull herself even says in the back where she's talking about the screenplay she wrote for the story that one band member in particular is a very interesting character and so she gave him more room in the screenplay. I would have to agree that he seems like an interesting character, but I wish he had gotten more development in the book. For probably about 75% of the story he was just there, not really doing much other than playing the instrument with the rest of the band. There was room to do more with him.<br /><br />The other thing that bothered me slightly was the way that the Seelie Court (Seleighe Court, Bright Court, Summer Court, whatever you prefer) approached Eddi. While I get that they were desperate and that they are Fae and think and react differently than humans, I was shocked by their abruptness. However, I think that a lot of that is that I like to think that the Seelie Fae are shiny, happy, friendly creatures when most theories have them as cool and unsympathetic. What makes them Seelie is that they don't actively seek to hurt. They may occasionally help, but humans are still mostly amusement. It still jars me a little when I see that sometimes, though.<br /><br />Other than that, though, I can't really think of anything else that I didn't like. Perhaps I would be able to come up with something if I wracked my brain for a few hours, but then this could just turn in to a rant about the book, and I don't want that either.<br /><br />One thing that I particularly liked was Bull's idea of Sidhe warfare. It makes sense that having eternal (or close to it) lives, they would view war differently from humans. It is, after all, a moment's entertainment, and rarely something to be taken seriously. I loved how they danced around each other (sometimes literally) when they weren't on the battlefield, taking care not to upset the all important status quo. The party in particular amused me greatly because of the way the Seelie and Unseelie Fae were reacting to each other.<br /><br />I also really liked how the Fae War didn't completely overtake Eddi's life. In so many fantasy books when the protagonist is swept off to deal with the problem plaguing the Fae folk, their lives become completely about that, but no one seems to have missed them when they return. In War for the Oaks, Eddi continues to struggle with her everyday, real life too, worrying about paying her rent and buying groceries. It made the book seem so much more realistic, if that's a word that can be applied to a fantasy novel.<br /><br />All in all, I thought that Bull did a wonderful job of weaving the two worlds together and drawing the reader in. The story had substance and the plot was strong and engaging.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy or supernatural novels.at sometimes, though. <br /> <br />Other than that, though, I can't really think of anything else that I didn't like.

US	15853110	R3VPCUNWBKHWGY	1563890119	763187671	The Sandman Vol. 1: Preludes and Nocturnes	Books	4	6	9	N	N	Great First Encounter	Preludes and Nocturnes was my first experience with a graphic novel. I'd had several friends tell me that The Sandman books were must-reads, but for a while I was wary. I just don't do comic books.  I do enjoy comic strips, but I tend to lose interest if the strip is longer than two or three rows in the newspaper.  I just can't follow them.<br /><br />I had, however, been told that The Sandman books read like a traditional story and since I love Neil Gaiman, I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />Based on Preludes and Nocturnes, I've come to two conclusions. First, though they don't read quite like a novel, as some of the story is told through the pictures rather than narration, these particular books are easy to follow and read enough like a traditional book to keep my attention.<br /><br />Second, these books are addicting. Every time I picked up Preludes and Nocturnes, I found it difficult to put down. I just wanted to keep reading and reading and reading and now that I've finished the book, I want to read the next one. I cannot wait until tomorrow when I get to pick up my copy of The Doll's House so I can read both that and Dream Country, which I already have. Unfortunately, the chances that those two books will occupy me until I can pick up book four are slim.<br /><br />One complaint that I've heard a couple of times about The Sandman is that the DC-universe characters were awkward because when the book was started they weren't sure how it was going to fit into the DC Universe, and it ended up that they created a new label for it anyway. I suppose this may be true, but as my familiarity with DC superheroes is limited to a small percentage of the movies that have been made about them, I would be the first to admit that I'm not the right person to judge that.<br /><br />For me, it was a little strange to have Batman referred to in the book as an actual person, but other than that I didn't see anything wrong with how they were portrayed.<br /><br />The rest of the characters were vibrant and interesting, though definitely very different than what I'm used to reading. Just the concepts of some of the characters were vastly different from any that I had seen before. It was very refreshing and I was impressed by all the different personalities that came through as I was reading.<br /><br />The only thing that I didn't really like about Preludes and Nocturnes is some of the art. Most of it, I really liked as I thought that it helped tell the story very well and added elements that wouldn't have been possible in a traditional novel. However, there were a few panels that I just didn't like the art in. They were a bit too graphic and they weren't depicting things that I wanted to see. They made reading that particular part uncomfortable for me.<br /><br />That, however, is my only complaint about Preludes and Nocturnes.
