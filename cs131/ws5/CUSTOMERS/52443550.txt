With an eye to bypassing some of Augustine's many redundancies and digressions, the Image/Doubleday edition -- \\"abridged for modern readers\\" -- is nonetheless a major commitment for the reader. Augustine began writing The City of God at age 59 and worked on it, off and on, for much of the next 14 years. The impetus for the beginning of this vast work (and its recurring focus) was the charge of Pagans (polytheists) that Christianity was responsible for the decay and demise of the Roman Empire. The charge put forward the claim that the prosperity and social stability of the state was dependant upon polytheistic worship. In response, Augustine arrays several lines of argument, rebutting the assumed 'goodness' of the Pagan state, as such, and detailing the ethical/moral and logical failings of Paganism. Augustine displays tremendous scholarship, employing the writings of Paganism's greatest historians and philosophers in his case against their religious claims. The result is a giant literary, philosophical, historical, theological and exegetical work. In this abridged edition, some redundant and digressive texts are omitted with notes indicating this and summarizing their content. The integrity of the book and chapter divisions is retained.<br />Against the 'city', i.e., society, of many gods, there is but one alternate society, this Augustine calls The City of God, adopting the expression found in several of King David's psalms. Not only is the society of many gods the society of polytheists, it is also the \\"city\\" of pantheists, atheistic materialists and philosophical Cynics. In the case of the Cynics and atheists, these false gods are the myriad gods of self, indeed, at least as many gods (selves) as there are believers in them. Thus there are two \\"cities\\", two loves, two ways to understand the big questions of existence, two destinations. Says Augustine:<br />\\"The one City began with the love of God; the other had its beginnings in the love of self.\\" XIV:13. \\"The city of man seeks the praise of men, whereas the height of glory for the other is to hear God in the witness of conscience. The one lifts up its head in its own boasting; the other says to God: 'Thou art my glory, thou liftest up my head.' (Psalm 3.4) In the city of the world both the rulers themselves and the people they dominate are dominated by the lust for domination; whereas in the City of God all citizens serve one another in charity. . .\\" XIV:28.<br />Among the many philosophical (and historical) passages of interest are Augustine's general recountings of the history and development of Italian and Ionian philosophy, in Book VIII, particularly as regards ethics, theology, physics and cosmography.<br /><br />For the reader whose serious interest is Christian theology and scriptural exegetics, Augustine needs no introduction. It would be fair to describe him as the most influential human voice of the Christian faith, post New Testament. I'll sketch my 'take' on his views in just three areas of interpretation on which there were conflicting views within the Christianity of late antiquity and which are yet disputed 1600 years later. These being (1) interpreting the Genesis creation account, (2) the balancing of determinism or 'predestination' with freedom of the will, and (3) the doctrine of 'hell'.<br />(1) Although he devotes the matter more specific attention in other of his writings than he does here, Augustine finds a literal interpretation if Genesis 1-2 to give rise to paradoxes and conflicts within the text that make a literal interpretation unworkable. His understanding is sometimes called 'literary', as opposed to 'literal'. Rather than being an abrupt history, the account is understood as being essentially an introduction, a theological primer, presenting a literary exposition of God's primordial separateness, non-dependence, intimacy with the created ('hovering') and ultimate sovereignty 'over' it (Gen. 1:1-2), in other words, a framework for understanding the nature of God's relationship to his creation. In more recent times, those who hold for the so-called \\"framework\\" understanding have claimed this \\"non-literal\\" view; for an earlier but similar exegesis, read Philo (c.20BC-50AD). For Augustine, the physical and temporal facts of creation are a mystery known only to God (see Job 38ff). While he does not place the creation of man temporally six solar days after the original act of divine creation (\\"As for these 'days,' it is difficult, perhaps impossible to think -- let alone to explain in words -- what they mean\\"), he does use the genealogies of the Pentateuch to roughly estimate a time for the creation of the first man in God's image (Adam). He spends some effort examining inconsistent points in various genealogical accounts (both within and between the Septuagint and the Hebrew) but concludes that this is no significant difficulty as the genealogies are intended to establish lineages (e.g., for the patriarchs) and not to establish complete temporal histories. They are accurate for the purpose intended, inaccurate only if their intent is not recognized.<br />(2) Today, many Christians who hold the strong 'Calvinist' view of \\"predestination\\", claim Augustine as a proponent of this view. While many succinct statements will appear to support this claim, we should understand such statements within their given contexts. In this regard, Augustine is no denier of the freedom of the human will or the omnibenevolence of God. Although he does use the term 'predestine,' he would certainly agree with Anselm that the meaning of the word when applied to the omniscient God is simply not the same as our understanding of the concept for which we appropriate the word. Augustine's wrestlings with the thorny openness/determinism question, as regards the human will, is not as `cut and dried' as the `Calvinist' often insists! Wesleyans and other so-called 'Arminians' can look to Augustine too, and will understand him in a broader and more contextual manner than the strict Calvinist can permit himself.<br />(3) While I personally find no major difficulty in Augustine's approach to the two doctrinal issues considered above, I disagree with his doctrine of Hell. For Augustine, Hell is relentless, eternal, sensory, bodily torture, wherein one is, in his words, \\"pounded by perpetual pain.\\" He tries to engage the opposing view of 'hell' being, in St Paul's words, \\"eternal destruction,\\" but here he fails (Book XXI). It seems clear enough to me that Hades' chamber of pain and torture was adopted from Paganism and not scripture. The two texts that are often held to support Augustine's view are better understood as literary than literal. Either the 'worm that turns forever' and the \\"smoke of their torment\\" that ascends forever are metaphors (they obviously are), or the \\"second death\\" and the \\"eternal destruction\\" are metaphors (they do not have that sense). When commissioning His disciples, in a direct statement Christ himself calls \\"hell\\" the ultimate destruction of the soul (Matt. 10:28). I think it is evident that a large number of Christians, including Augustine, have on this issue chosen the wrong verses as metaphorical ('literary' as opposed to 'literal'), and the wrong verses as literal. The opposite of eternal life is eternal not-life, an eternal punishment to be sure, but not eternal torture, which, after all, would require eternal life and not its contrary. Augustine errs because he sees divine justice as necessarily trumping divine mercy, a view that cannot be well argued from New Testament scripture (\\"God IS love\\"; 1 John 4:8/16; and \\"Mercy triumphs over judgment\\", James 2:13). [Yes, I am a so-called 'annihilationist', many religious traditions stand against this understanding, many religious traditions are wrong.] Christians have been disagreeing on these issues for a long time, and obviously some readers will disagree with me.<br />In Book XXII, concluding this great work, Augustine speculatively considers the nature of an eternal life reconciled finally and completely with God. Here, the text simply soars. Of course there is much more of interest in this expansive volume -- its historical importance, or one of Augustine's famous treatments of the physics of 'time' (Book XI), for example, than I can touch on here. \\"Thus, it is the love of study that seeks a holy leisure; and only the compulsion of charity that shoulders necessary activity.\\"n the strict Calvinist can permit himself.

The ideas of the pre-Socratic philosophers are largely known to us by what is said of them by the post-Socratic thinkers, who wrote and were copied far more extensively. One nice feature of this book is Schofield's explanation of how and why philosophizing and writing in the Ionian tradition changed (essentially with Plato). The earlier philosophers generally produced in writing only a summation their evolved understanding of the world, as matured thinkers, rather than writing over the course of their lives. It is believed that Anaxagoras wrote his book, only a few fragments of which are now extant, in his mid thirties, at about the same time Socrates was born (469?BC). Aristotle, who went to war with the ideas of so many of the earlier philosophers, held an unusual respect for Anaxagoras.<br />The archaic sage was someone rather unlike the modern philosopher, but not necessarily in such a way that his thought was more crude or less defensible, he simply worked quite differently: \\". . . by and large the Presocratics give the impression one would expect of thinkers who had to create their own audiences . . . without the aid of such institutions as the university or the publishing industry. . . If he took up the pen, then, he did so in a cultural setting and in a frame of mind quite different from those of his modern counterpart. Until the end of the fifth century [BC], when in Athens at least literacy became widespread and book production multiplied, no philosopher wrote more than one or two short treatises.\\" p. 29 So it was that in Anaxagoras's day, a philosophical book presumably would \\"offer a final statement of it's author's doctrine, and indeed of the truth about the world.\\" p. 30 Arguments and treatment of counterarguments had been given orally, contemporaneous thinkers had heard them, challenged them, discussed them -- the pen was for concluding dogmatic assertions. \\"[E]ven if Anaxagoras's book contained little in way of argument for it's basic themes, it need not follow that its author saw no need for such argument.\\" It is better understood that \\"he writes like a man who has lived long with his thoughts and is so convinced of their truth and importance that he is prepared to sacrifice something of ready and precise intelligibility in the urgency of his attempt to communicate their essence.\\" p. 32<br />Schofield brings his knowledge and speculations to bear on the fragments, but observes that, \\"books, as experience teaches and as Plato complained, seldom capture everything that is important in a man's philosophizing.\\" p. 28 The interpretations of Anaxagoras by some later commentators are discussed and analyzed.<br /><br />Treated first is that feature of Anaxagoras's thought which is perhaps best known, Fragment XII, his understanding of the primordial Mind. Schofield examines whether commentators are correct in understanding that this mind is intended to have a capital 'm' (that is, is the divine Mind) finding that this understanding is certainly the obvious one. But many of the statements can be applied to the individual human mind as well. It is a case less easily made, but Schofield treats this material as thoroughly as perhaps it should be. Chapter two looks at the first Fragment, and we find something sounding remotely like our present big bang cosmology (it is asserted that, at the origin of the world, all things were \\"together\\" and \\"unlimited\\" in \\"smallness\\"), but Anaxagoras's understanding was hardly ours, his intent seems to have been the rehabilitation and refinement of Anaximines's cosmology.<br /><br />I terms of biography, not much can be said of Anaxagoras, although what can be said is quite interesting (biography is not important to Schofield's essay). A Greek of Asia Minor, it is said that he gave away his property and moved to Athens to pursue the science of contemplation. A charge of impiety -- he was accused of arguing contrary to Athenian polytheistic political theology, teaching that the sun was a celestial body of fire and not a deity -- forced him to leave Athens. His adversaries in Athens likely colored him as an atheist but his view is better understood as being among the first of the rational monotheists, although he was not specifically concerned with the idea of an incorporeal nature for the intelligent first cause. Later thinkers would be, Aristotle was certainly an heir to his line of causational and theological thought. For the philosophically fascinated, Schofield's book is an excellent examination of not only Anaxagoras's thought, but of the world of pre-Socratic ideas.d not a deity -- forced him to leave Athens.

Here are Gamow's two 1940's Mr Tompkins books popularizing modern physics, in one tidy package. An earlier reviewer has suggested that this book be produced as an animated educational film, a good idea, but I picture it as being more of a computer enhanced live action video. The chapters on relativistic geometries and cosmological models could really be audio-visual treats, and it's hard to imagine a better basis for a script explaining the strange new world of physics to the interested lay public. The lions-share of what science now claims to know about the world was developed from a seemingly strange handful of theories thrashed out in the first three decades of the twentieth century. Gamow was both a party to this theoretical explosion and a gifted writer. Most of what has occurred in physics since these books were first published, has essentially been the refining of the ideas discussed here, so, for the most part, the science is still significant. But while Gamow had some important cosmological ideas -- he predicted the cosmic microwave background radiation, the discovery of which earned Wilson and Penzias a Noble Prize (in which Gamow should have shared, but did not) -- he also bet on the wrong horse when it came to cosmological models.<br />Gamow cleverly and artfully presents the three basic cosmological models being argued from the 1930s through 1965.* The context is a night at the opera in which noted physicists sing the virtues of their respective theoretical opinions. First up is no other than the initial developer of the expanding universe ('big bang') model, the Belgian physicist and cleric, A. George Lemaitre. The Lemaitre universe is a majestically wondrous, one-off, elegant masterpiece. He sings, \\"Z' splendeur of z' origine. . . Worrk of Z' Lorrd!\\" Second is the oscillating or 'bouncing' model, and this piece is sung by Gamow, who at that time favored the concept of an eternally recycling universe (bang, expand, contract, re-bang, expand, contract, ->, etc). The third and last piece to be sung is of the Bondi-Gold self-maintaining or \\"steady state\\" universe, so famously preferred by Hoyle. Appropriately, this singer is generated mysteriously from intergalactic space, singing \\"Was never formed in time gone by. . . But is, has been. . .shall ever be. . .\\"<br />Well, on this question we seem to have a winner, and no, it isn't Gamow's model. As Roger Penrose relates in the foreword, Gamow's bouncing universe and Hoyle's \\"steady state\\" model are both dead ducks these days. Seventy-five years of observation and mathematical fine-tuning have made something like Lemaitre's general understanding look like the only serious cosmological game in town. But don't hold that against this artful and thoroughly fun book. Gamow discounted the 'steady state', and most of the science here is still sound and relevant.<br />*[File this under 'is there nothing new under the sun?': 1600 years ago, Augustine of Hippo recorded (City of God, Book XII) that classical cosmographies all distil into three basic models, the same three considered here by Gamow. (These same three models subsume the \\"innumerable universes\\" of Epicurus' speculation and of the recently famous so-called 'strong anthropic principle'.) Augustine bet on the right horse though, reasoning that the 'cycling' and 'eternal' models both seek finally to avoid rather than admit a true explanation. Only the universe-from-nothing (ex nihilo) model admits that the universe has an explanation -- albeit a grandly mysterious one.]<br />This volume is classic science writing in a most entertaining package, it awaits some creative screenplay adaptor and video genius to make from it the best popular science audio-visual experience ever.

US	52443550	R2BBNT9FKE4ZLA	0192825259	50180144	Anselm of Canterbury: The Major Works (Oxford World's Classics)	Books	4	44	53	N	N	Critical, repetitive, for the theologically tenacious only.	Anselm is most famously identified with his ontological arguments. This collection begins with the Monologian, a soliloquy (or meditation), and the Proslogian, an allocution, Anselm's go at a more robust ontology. It is true that classical ontology has not been highly regarded in the modern and post-modern academies; the \\"science of being\\" is metaphysical and not something that fits well with modern methods, or uses, of inquiry. This is so because classic ontology, as developed notably by Anaxagoras, Plato, Plotinus, etc, sees the central question of being (i.e. existence, essence, the-thing-in-itself) as transcending all sense-based inquiry (empiricism). In modern thought, 'pure reason' as such recoils from a ubiquitous relativism (please notice the self-contradiction) and broadly nihilistic presuppositions. An epistemologically and psychologically troubled mix! It is not the case that the modern thinker has 'refuted' ontological arguments so much as it is the case that he fancies them odd and tedious, presumes them useless, and conveniently pronounces them \\"meaningless\\". If, after surveying the problems of the modern/post-modern views, you think Plato, Aristotle, and Plotinus might have been onto something, Anselm may interest you (although he may put you to sleep with his deliberate and repetitive arguments).<br />On First Philosophy:<br />\\"Supreme truth does not admit at all of the big and the small, the long and the short, which belong to spatial and temporal distension.\\" From that which \\"time and space stipulate, I do not doubt that the supreme substance is exempt.\\" (Mono. 22)<br />\\". . . the supreme spirit . . . is not like anything. It is the original.\\" (M. 32)<br />On the Trinity (here Anselm hoped that Augustine would have concurred):<br />\\"Father [supreme essence, consciousness], Son [understanding, Word of the supreme essence], and Spirit [love, mutuality of supreme essence and the begotten Word], each on its own, as individual, knows and understands -- while all three taken together are not three knowers and understanders but one single knower, one single understander. . . one speaker and one thing spoken; one wisdom in them that speaks, one substance in them that is spoken. From which it follows that there is only one Word. . . A conclusion that has something of the wonderful and unaccountable about it!\\" (M. 63)<br />\\"Perhaps it is explicable -- and hence our conclusions true -- only up to a point, while being incomprehensible, and therefore ineffable, as a whole . . . the supreme essence is above and beyond all other natures. Thus when we talk about it, the words may be common . . . but not their meanings.\\" (M. 65)<br />The Proslogian contains Anselm's famous ontological argument \\"that God truly exists.\\" \\"That-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-thought\\" (alternately, that-than-which-a-greater-cannot-be-thought) either must be the highest/truest/purest thought that can exist or the highest/truest/purest reality. Since we readily discern that the highest reality must be greater than the highest thought short of such a reality, it follows that something-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-thought must [supra]exist, and must be beyond containment by the greatest thought  -- which must be less than itself. Although all human language is inadequate to the task of naming (i.e., defining) this \\"something\\", it is what we call God.<br /><br />Like Augustine, whom he regarded highly, Anselm says that evil is nothing, as it is most rightly understood as being the privation of good. \\"So we should say that injustice is nothing but the privation of justice.\\" He acknowledges that to speak of evil and injustice imparts upon them an apparent \\"thing\\" status, the words are, after all, nouns. But this is a problem of mere language, not reality. Nonetheless, given that we cannot even speak of evil and injustice without elevating them to being \\"something,\\" Anselm says that in this sense they are \\"quasi-something.\\"<br /><br />Many works in this volume, De Grammatico (an essay on logic and linguistics), the treatises On Truth, On Free Will, and so forth, use the classic framework of teacher-student dialogs. The translation is quite readable although the material itself is mostly dense, deliberate, and redundant (which is why many avoid or reject metaphysics -- a curious circumstance given that the human mind can make no judgments without metaphysical suppositions). There are some lengthy discussions of the logic of Trinitarian monotheistic theology that are reminiscent of Plotinus and Augustine (also Paul, e.g., Gal. 4.6). De Concordia is Anselm's attempt to reconcile divine \\"foreknowledge\\" with the concepts of predestination and human freedom. He says, \\"It should also be understood that the word 'foreknowledge', as also the word 'predestine' are not used of God literally, for in him there is no before or after, but all things are present to him at once.\\" Boethius argued the matter more directly (and enjoyably) five centuries earlier.<br />Anselm's treatment of the Atonement, 'Why God Became Man', explains the debt humanity has incurred by way of transgression (sin), a debt man must pay but cannot. Simply put, only God is capable of paying man's debt to God, yet man must pay it, because it is man's debt. Thus the logical necessity of the Incarnation and the Atonement (and of both mercy and justice). Anything less would amount to the Immutable abandoning His will for man, something that, being immutable, He cannot do (by reason of definition and logical mutual exclusion). For this reason Christ's crucifixion was not punishment for sin but was his willful alleviation of the ultimate necessity of punishment.<br />There are some interesting passages here, including a few gems, but the collection is slow-going and repetitive. You'll spend a lot of time in this book, encountering many ideas for the twentieth painstaking time.

US	52443550	R3J2F64FB3PP0S	0802139256	996091853	Peace Like a River	Books	2	12	23	N	N	"I'm sorry, but nope."	I browse books, be it online or in second hand stores. Not infrequently, when in the latter, something catches my eye that is otherwise completely 'off my radar screen'. Enger's \\"Peace\\" was just such an anomaly. Two things intrigued me: [secondarily] the glowing praise printed all over it, and [more promisingly] the fact that the story involved someone growing up in the same part of the world (northern Great Plains) and at the same time (1960s) as I had myself. That it was said to contain spiritual and philosophical insight also seemed interesting. Even though I don't read very much fiction, I was hopeful.<br />And then disappointed. The blurb on the front cover instructs that this is \\"a reminder of why we read fiction to begin with.\\" For me, the book is a reminder of why I generally don't read fiction -- things that never happened to people that never existed.<br />The first miracle is credible enough, Jeremiah Land, faced with a physician telling him that his newborn son would not live, \\"smote Dr. Nokes\\" and commanded the infant, in the name of the living God, to breath. And the baby, who becomes our narrator, is well. Powerful story-telling. \\"I'm going to enjoy this,\\" I thought. Unfortunately, Enger has not even begun to push the envelope of incredulousness. In the voice of Reuben Land, Enger says, \\"let me say something about the word miracle. For too long it's been used to characterize things or events that, though pleasant, are entirely normal . . . I'm sorry, but nope.\\" It seems that a \\"miracle\\" must be outlandish, perhaps to the point of being absurd. Take Jeremiah's \\"third miracle\\" in which he casually, unknowingly, walks on air for some sixty feet, Reuben quite accidentally noticing. Reuben believes that the common runs of miracles are mere trivialities; that they are called miracles at all has been learned from \\"greeting cards.\\" Lest you think that Reuben is sundering profound insights, he obviously knows nothing of the fine-tuning of the 'quarks and gluons' relationship that gives rise to a \\"material\\" world, or the staggeringly precise interplay of gravitation and cosmic anti-gravity (inflation), or the inexplicable sophistication of the 'simplest' living cell. One who hasn't been educated by greeting cards (or numb fiction) could go on and on in this same vein. It is rather foolish story-telling to insist that we known what is and is not a miracle. The greatest genius among us is not that smart. \\"I'm sorry, but nope.\\" Why is there this [supposedly uninteresting] merely \\"pleasant\\" and \\"entirely normal\\" world at all? As Leibniz so eloquently observed, that \\"normal\\" should be anything other than an absolute \\"nothing\\" is perhaps the most remarkable mystery we can attempt to fathom. If less eloquently, Aristotle had observed the same. It all looks like a miracle to me, even without people walking on air. So it is that Rube's spiritual and philosophical insights are, let's say, wanting; but trying now to stay with the story . . .<br />The characters are interesting, have many admirable qualities, but are less than believable. Thoughtful and quietly stalwart Jeremiah goes wallowing in Reverend Johnny's faith-healing ruckus, huh? About fifty easy reading pages in, the story was obviously developing pivotal events -- dramatic, fateful, and central to everything that is to follow. But, looking longingly at several nearby books, I couldn't take it anymore. The next time I'm tempted to read fiction, it had better be Dostoevsky, Faulkner, Endo, or the like.

One who hasn't been educated by greeting cards (or numb fiction) could go on and on in this same vein. It is rather foolish story-telling to insist that we known what is and is not a miracle. The greatest genius among us is not that smart. \\"I'm sorry, but nope.\\" Why is there this [supposedly uninteresting] merely \\"pleasant\\" and \\"entirely normal\\" world at all? As Leibniz so eloquently observed, that \\"normal\\" should be anything other than an absolute \\"nothing\\" is perhaps the most remarkable mystery we can attempt to fathom. If less eloquently, Aristotle had observed the same. It all looks like a miracle to me, even without people walking on air. So it is that Rube's spiritual and philosophical insights are, let's say, wanting; but trying now to stay with the story . . .  The characters are interesting, have many admirable qualities, but are less than believable. Thoughtful and quietly stalwart Jeremiah goes wallowing in Reverend Johnny's faith-healing ruckus, huh? About fifty easy reading pages in, the story was obviously developing pivotal events -- dramatic, fateful, and central to everything that is to follow. But, looking longingly at several nearby books, I couldn't take it anymore. The next time I'm tempted to read fiction, it had better be Dostoevsky, Faulkner, Endo, or the like.

While the process does not always guarantee an inerrant conclusion, it often protects against vacuous leaps from ignorance to ignorance.\\" (p105)<br /><br />One might say that a relatively small portion of Zacharias' book is actually apologetics proper. The treatment of the cosmological argument is cursory. That argument has been well enough presented by many others, beginning perhaps with Aristotle. The design argument is sketchily treated in a discussion of the second law of thermodynamics. His argument here will beg criticism, not that it is strictly invalid (it is not), but the atheist has an even larger philosophical stake in arguing for \\"the optimistic arrow of time\\" (evolutionary 'ascent') than the theist has in pointing to the ubiquity of \\"the pessimistic arrow of time\\" (the laws of entropy). After all, a world in which biological life would succeed in spite of the hardest law of the universe would have to be a strikingly \\"fine tuned\\" world! On this issue, it would be awfully tough, if not impossible, for atheism to find a winning move, however, it will of necessity attack Zacharias' underdeveloped argument here. The discussion on this point should have been further developed (perhaps referencing the work of the agnostic physicist and mathematical geneticist, Hubert Yockey, for example) or else omitted. As Yockey has rightly pointed out, it is disingenuous for philosophical materialists to dogmatically argue would-be \\"science\\" on points on which we should all honestly admit ignorance. In other words, there are better ways to argue for, and/or against, Design. It is probably the case that Zacharias did not treat the cosmological and design arguments more strongly than he did because they are not a critical part of his thesis in The Real Face of Atheism.<br />The moral argument, however, along with the widely assumed concept of 'rightness', emerges necessarily whenever examining atheistic judgments. The essential thesis here contrasts the final implications of the two opposing worldviews: the inherent hope and meaningfulness of the theistic worldview, the inescapable meaninglessness of the atheistic view. Zacharias states that few who insist on a Godless world have acknowledged, or even understood, the logical conclusions of such a view -- the absence of basis for epistemological and ethical judgments and the absolute futility of human consciousness itself.<br /><br />\\"Sisyphus and Solomon came to the same deduction, born out of their experience: monotony finds no relief in adding variety or changing our attitude about it. Activity does not create meaning; it is the other way around. If life in its existential expression has no meaning, then a change of attitude does not change the reality of meaninglessness.\\" (p77)<br /><br />One of the few \\"morticians of the Absolute\\" to recognize bluntly the pointlessness of the human condition in a Godless cosmos, was Nietzsche, who understandably sank into depression and never recovered mental health. And here is the general argument of the book -- contrasting the concluding implications of the theistic worldview/philosophy with that of atheism. Either there is an external Absolute guarantor (however mysterious this may be), or we drift hopelessly in (logically self-contradictory) 'absolute relativism'.<br />The two appendices might be better seen as the concluding chapters, they are not unimportant. They argue that a worldview must be reasoned toward -- rather than inherited or accepted because it is easy or \\"feels good\\" -- and must be more coherent, consistent and defensible than contending views. It must be strong on many points, with an eye always toward explanation rather than existentialist default. This will mean acquainting oneself with opposing ideas and arguments. In this vein, the reader would do well to examine two books by James W. Sire: Habits of the Mind, and The Universe Next Door. In spite of a few weak points, which are a bit peripheral to the main thesis, and the fact that it could easily have been much longer (more thorough-going), this book is a fairly good analysis of the psychological, ethical, and epistemological 'cost' (i.e., \\"real face\\") of atheism.ew weak points, which are a bit peripheral to the main thesis, and the fact that it could easily have been much longer (more thorough-going), this book is a fairly good analysis of the psychological, ethical, and epistemological 'cost' (i.e., \\"real face\\") of atheism.	2005-05-05

Otherwise, if we come to Scripture with our mind already made up, all we are likely to hear is the reassuring echoes of our own cultural prejudice.\\" (p151)<br /><br />This is a very helpful and enjoyable book, and I am a bit surprised that is has so far garnered only a few superficial reviews in this forum. Stott provides a well-paced and well-supported overview of the harmony and message of the Old and New Testaments, a look at their respective cultural contexts and provides three basic principles for interpreting the Bible. My hardcover volume also features maps, charts, and photographs, which enrich both understanding and enjoyment. As Stott says, \\"Just as in a children's treasure hunt, one is sometimes fortunate enough to stumble immediately upon the treasure but, more usually, has to follow laboriously from clue to clue until at last the treasure is found, so it is with Bible reading. . . But a painstaking pursuit of the clues will ultimately lead every reader to that treasure whose worth is beyond price.\\" (p19, 20)<br /><br />Near the end of the sixth chapter, explaining the authority of the Bible, Stott says: \\". . . to accept the authority of the Bible is a Christian thing to do. It is neither a religious eccentricity, nor a case of discreditable obscurantism, but the good sense of Christian faith and humility. It . . . may be called the 'Christian' view precisely because it is Christ's view.<br />\\"To accept the divine origin of the Bible is not to pretend that there are no problems. To be candid, there are many problems . . .\\" He cites, as examples, the problems of pain and suffering, going on to say, \\". . . it is essential that we wrestle honestly with biblical problems. It is not Christian to bury our heads in the sand, pretending that no problems exist. Nor is it Christian to manipulate Scripture in order to achieve a forced, artificial harmonization. No, we work at the problems with intellectual integrity. . . Jesus Christ taught it and exhibited it. . . To follow Christ is always sober, humble, Christian realism.\\" (p135, 136)<br /><br />The only dissenting comment I will muster is that I was slightly disappointed with Stott's casual dismissal of the exegetic works of Philo and Origen. Of course, I have seen this before. The complaints of their opponents are assumed without any attempt to give Philo and Origen their due consideration (page 146). As those who have actually read them will be aware, these expositors (and others of their approach, like Gregory of Nyssa, and to a lesser extent, Augustine) were intelligent, assiduous, exceptionally knowledgeable in both the text and the ancient philology, and centrally focused on reverence for both God and scripture. When Stott goes on to speak about \\"the general sense of Scripture\\" (i.e., \\"the principle of harmony\\") he addresses the great concern of both Philo and Origen. They did \\"meditate day and night\\" on God's Word, as the Psalm says, \\"like one who finds great spoil,\\" that is, \\"gold\\" and \\"honey.\\" One should not dismiss individuals who have proceeded to live this life while also holding up this type of a model for others.

Are post-modern western culture and its attendant philosophy of education now recklessly and dangerously committed to the ideas of ethical and epistemological relativism? Bloom argues 'yes'. Some readers will find little to object to here, others will find much. In a \\"nutshell\\", here's Professor Bloom's introduction (and his thesis), in his own words:<br /><br />\\"There is one thing a professor can be absolutely certain of: almost every student entering the university believes, or says he believes, that truth is relative. If this belief is put to the test, one can count on the student's reaction: they will be uncomprehending. . . The relativity of truth is not a theoretical insight but a moral postulate, the condition of a free society, or so they see it. (p25) . . . The purpose of their education is not to make them scholars but to provide them with a moral virtue -- openness. (p26) . . . There is no enemy other than the man who is not open to everything. (p27) . . . There are no absolutes; freedom is absolute. Of course the result is that, on the one hand, the argument justifying freedom disappears and, on the other, all beliefs begin to have the attenuated character that was initially supposed to be limited to religious belief. (p28) . . . Actually openness results in . . . conformism . . . here we can create all the life-styles we want. Our openness means we do not need others. Thus what is advertised as a great opening is a great closing. (p34) . . . The point is to force students to recognize that there are other ways of thinking and that Western ways are not better. . . But if the students were really to learn something of the minds of these non-Western cultures -- which they do not -- they would find that each and every one of these cultures is ethnocentric. All of them think their way is the best way, and all others are inferior. . . Only in Western nations, i.e., those influenced by Greek philosophy, is there some willingness to doubt the identification of the good with one's own way. One should conclude from the study of non-Western cultures that  not only to prefer one's way but to believe it best, superior to all others, is primary and even natural -- exactly the opposite of what is intended by requiring students to study these cultures, The scientific study of other cultures is almost exclusively a Western phenomenon . . . If we are to learn from those cultures, we must wonder whether such scientific study is a good idea. (p36)\\"<br />Drawing from Plato's famous representation of man as a prisoner in a cave: \\"A culture is a cave. [Plato] did not suggest going around to other cultures [i.e., caves] as a solution to the limitations of the cave. . . That is why philosophy, not history or anthropology, is the most important human science. . . Openness used to be the virtue that permitted us to seek the good by using reason. It now means accepting everything and denying reason's power. (p38)\\" Openness to closedness is what we teach. . . Yet the fact there have been different opinions about good and bad . . . in no way proves that none is true or superior to others. (p39)\\"<br />\\"Socrates knew, after a lifetime of unceasing labor, that he was ignorant. Now every high school student knows that. . . What accounts for our amazing progress? Could it be that our experience has been so impoverished . . . that there is nothing substantial enough left there to resist criticism, and we therefore have no world left of which to be really ignorant? (p43)\\"<br /><br />The book is rather long-winded and hardly perfect, but these are powerful issues that most in the Western world now relate to as would Plato's famous cave dwellers, that is, with comfortably numb ignorance, disinterest, and/or a false confidence in questionable presuppositions/conclusions. Some critics may worry that the thesis appeals to certain Rightist ideologies, and on some points it does, but for the most part that complaint is an oversimplification, and not reasonably helpful. The problem with Bloom's thesis is that it is argued too specifically, has too many pieces, and, although on many points it's diagnose of symptoms is correct, it begins to sound like so much whining, the cause of these symptoms is not succinctly defined. The widely unacknowledged nihilism gripping Western post-modernism is the pervasive malignancy of our culture. C.S. Lewis knew something that Bloom did not -- the arguments against ethical and epistemological relativism are better made at the broader abstract level. The problem lies deeper than the conflict of feminism (most often a 'politically-correct' me-ism) with both nature and convention, deeper than the market-driven obsession of academia with specialization, such that \\"educated\\" decision-makers may see the gnat but can see neither the forest nor the trees. Lewis' \\"The Abolition of Man\\" is a 'leaner, meaner' treatment of the underlying disease. Like Lewis, Bloom sees a broadly unnoticed nihilism and uncritical relativism as denying college students a truly liberal education. Where a rigorously liberal education (literature, philosophy, etc) is lost, so is much of what is meant by \\"human\\" and we increasingly become mind-sedated cogs in a misguided wheel, Platonic cave-dwellers, delusional, 'enlightened' by a chosen darkness, unjustifiably over-confident in our impoverished 'scholarship'.<br />Bloom's book can certainly serve as a springboard for lively discussions of these issues (which is exactly what he hoped for). Relativism in ethics and epistemology is far too frequently assumed to be 'true' because it is assumed to be 'virtuous' (or vice versa), of course both assumptions logically gut themselves.

Maier's introduction is a very nice foundation from which to gain an appreciation for Eusebius' peerless Historia Ecclesiastica, as well as a sketch of what we know of Esebius and his many other works, and the nature of this translation. This is one of the essential books for the serious student of Western/ Middle Eastern history and the Christian church. Eusebius, Bishop of Cæsarea, born sometime around 260 AD, is easily the single most robust resource and authority for church history between the New Testament apostolic age and the early fourth century. The \\"must have\\" volumes for the study of Christian antiquity are the works of Philo, Josephus, and Eusebius, although one will probably want to add at least some of the writings of Origen and Tertullian. From Philo Judaeus (c. 20 BC - c.50 AD) we gain exegetical (interpretive) and theological insight into the scriptural monotheism in which the church was born; from Josephus Flavius (37 AD - c. 101) we garner historical context and corroboration; from Eusebius we cull many details of second and third century Christianity. While many are at least aware of Josephus' work, few have any knowledge whatever about the treasure troves bestowed by Philo and Eusebius. This is unfortunate. As Maier concludes his introduction, this volume \\"is the most important work of the most voluminous extant author, pagan or Christian, of the late third and early fourth centuries: the first history of the church ever written.\\"<br /><br />An important source for Eusebius was his relationship with Pamphilus, curator of the Cæsarean church's extensive library, a repository of various works, many of them placed there \\"by Origen himself\\"; many of them no longer existent. Given the social, religious, and political oppression of those first three centuries (Eusebius gives us much of this information), the documentation and correspondence available to Eusebius was obviously quite impressive. Eusebius and Pamphilus (one of Origen's numerous prominent students), having access to more of Origen's extensive writings than would have been available to others, were strong defenders of Origen, the spiritual, intellectual and ecclesiastical champion of the early church, as adversaries of his teaching and reputation began to appear. This opposition was not unusual, the church was, and had been, beset with internal disagreements. Eusebius is the chronicler of many of these problems as well as the physical violence waged against the church from without. The descriptions of the manner of torture to which a great number of martyrs were subject, is staggering. The emperor cults of the Romans and their military enforcers were bizarrely creative with their salacious gore (Eusebius tells of \\"machines\\" employed in abruptly ripping live victims into two or more pieces, for example). This is a real eye-opener, to put it mildly.<br /><br />Eusebius' History is a compilation of his ten ecclesiastical histories, collected, as they have been for centuries, as ten chapters in one volume. They can certainly be read start-to-finish if you so choose. They are equally valuable as an encyclopedic resource as they encompass all the noted personalities of these centuries; the martyrs, the apologists, teachers and evangelists, the politicians, the mavens of torture and persecution, the teachers of heresies and their opponents, the reasoning of the heresies and the reasoning against them. The book is also an excellent starting point from which to choose other writings from these centuries -- many of them have been lost of course, but thankfully many others, like this work itself, have not.<br />This translation is modestly supplemented with photographs, is very 'readable' and highly recommended, particularly for the inquisitive Christian.

The subtitle, \\"a critical introduction to epistemology,\\" is precisely descriptive of this volume. I'd say it is somewhat beyond an introduction -- and it is nothing if not critical (but of course any serious consideration of epistemology must be). The discourse throughout tackles the problem of skepticism, both classical (Agrippan) and modern (Cartesian). As Williams states in the introduction, \\"Once we become aware that even our most cherished views can be challenged, there is no going back to a pre-critical, traditionalist outlook. This is why concern with knowledge is no longer optional. . . Scepticism is the skeleton in Western rationalism's closet: an argumentatively sophisticated attack on rationalism itself. It represents the extreme case of a tradition of critical inquiry reflexively applied. From the very beginnings of Western philosophy, there has been a counter-tradition arguing that the limits of reason are much more confining than epistemological optimists like to think. . . If scepticism cannot be refuted, the rational outlook undermines itself.\\"<br />Once familiar with the arguments of philosophical skepticism, it seems they are but modestly more \\"sophisticated\\" than those of mere practical, I might say \\"methodological\\", skepticism. All skepticism, practical or philosophical, is rather highly intuitive; one needn't be a stark, raving genius to understand Descartes' description of the problem of external ('objective') knowledge. As it turns out, skepticism is built on the same foundational assumptions as is the most pervasive model of epistemological theory -- Foundationalism. At first blush, the \\"foundational\\" theory of knowledge might seem like the appropriate model with which to defend knowledge from philosophical skepticism. But Foundationalism fails on two levels; it neither overcomes skepticism nor can allow for epistemological risk-taking (which can have obvious merit). It can be argued that the difficulty of foundationalism may be that it is atomistic -- might a holistic theory fare better? A holistic line of attack is the so-called Coherence theory, but this approach, while conceived as being less vulnerable than Foundationalism, appeals to the same rational underpinnings as Foundationalism and, yes, Philosophical Skepticism. The problems, in all cases, are analyzed in the first 12 chapters.<br />After a diagnostic treatment of the foundational assumptions of Philosophical Skepticism, the epistemology (theory of knowledge) for which Williams finally argues is the so-called Contextual theory. While Contextualism rejects the assumptions of Foundationalism and its quarreling cousins, it allows, within a \\"default and challenge\\" framework, for: immediate knowledge, a methodology of fallibilism (i.e., falsification), and epistemological risk-taking. A deflationist approach to knowledge, contextualism is neither atomistic nor strictly holistic. It is critical to notice that Contextualism is not mere epistemological Relativism, as Williams says, \\"the relativist, like the sceptic, is a disappointed foundationalist.\\"<br /><br />The author finally cautions that he has not offered the final word on these problems. But the treatment is obviously much more thorough than it appears in my brief review, and while I question a few of Williams assertions (very few actually), as an epistemological optimist (and a 'practical' rather than 'philosophical' skeptic), I suggest that he's pretty much gotten it right. The book is well worth your time if you are interested in the theory of knowledge (and if you have any interest in defending your beliefs/judgments, you should be).tic -- might a holistic theory fare better?

Some have said that the Anglican/Episcopalian church is \\"the thinking man's church\\" (although there may be some concern regarding the church in North America) and I must say there is some evidentiary merit in this assessment. To a list of excellent expositors that includes C.S. Lewis, John Polkinghorne, Desmond Tutu, and Alister McGrath, based on this volume, I may need to add John Stott. This book is very strong throughout.<br />The book is structured in four parts. I/ The Original Jesus (the New Testament accounts [excepting Revelation, that being treated in part 4]); II/ The Ecclesiastical Jesus (Jesus as the church has presented him); III/ The Influential Jesus (the inspirational influence Jesus has had on selected individuals): IV/ The Eternal Jesus (how Jesus challenges us today).<br />Any time a writer undertakes an exegetical treatment of the book of Revelation (part four of this volume) he will [necessarily] put forward disputed understandings. But in this reader's opinion, Stott is near masterful here. Some rather popular but poorly considered literalizations and convoluted embellishments are gently but firmly 'left behind.'<br /><br />Each of the four parts is so good that no one stands above the others. I appreciated Stott's consideration, in part two, of Thomas a Kempis' \\"Imitation of Christ\\", a long esteemed devotional classic that unfortunately promulgates some sorely deficient theology. I was happy to find that others have observed this (my amazon.com review of that volume was not well received). Churchmen have, in many instances, presented some poorly developed Christology. Inevitably our ideas about Jesus fall short of the profundity, mystery, and beauty of the incomparable Christ. Sometimes, the Teacher who's \\"burden is light\\" has been taught by men as being far too burdensome. Stott relates: \\"Procrustes in Greek mythology was a brutal robber who compelled his victims to fit the dimensions of his iron bed. If they were too short, he stretched them. If they were too long, he chopped off their feet. The Christian Procrustes exhibits a similar inflexibility, forcing Jesus into his or her way of thinking and resorting to ruthless measures in order to secure his conformity. From Procrustes and all his disciples, good Lord, deliver us!\\" (p128)<br />Stott's book is highly recommended, particularly for the individual who's understanding of Christian faith might be focused upon his own excellent (of course) doctrine or his personal affinity for a stilted \\"old time religion\\".oo long, he chopped off their feet.

This is the sixth of Davies's books that I've read, and eight chapters in I fully expected to be rating it at five stars. A few chapters later, I was thinking more along the lines of three. First the good stuff:<br />What Einstein did to our understanding of time has been discussed in many or Davies' books, but not as extensively as it is here. It is unlikely that the concept of time dilation can be explained any more simply and directly than it is when the author relates how the decay of a muon, a short-lived particle which functions as an \\"atomic clock\\", is dramatically slowed when in a high-energy state (i.e., moving near the speed of light as the result of so-called cosmic rays colliding with near-Earth particles, or energized in a particle accelerator). We might say that time is thus \\"stretched\\" in a way that is rather easily measured. As the world at large is indeed populated with such a variety of energy states and curved gravitational fields, of \\"clocks\\" running at different speeds, it is not difficult to understand time in terms of a 'foam' or 'froth' of quantum space-times. \\"Now\\" is relative. So far, so good, professor Davies, in fact very good.<br />The sketch of Einstein's life and work is interesting enough and appropriately brief; so is the treatment of the significance of the kind of \\"thought experiment\\" which was central to his work. When Davies states, \\"Science is based on the assumption that the world is rational, and that human reasoning reflects, albeit in a somewhat shaky way, an underlying order in nature,\\" he presages what will (in my opinion), a few chapters later, prove to be the undermining of the first two hundred pages by the last eighty (my hardcover edition is 285 pages). Okay, now for the not-so-good stuff:<br />Beginning in chapter nine, in which the author treats the second law of thermodynamics, it seems that science fiction is as much in order as hard physics (I permit myself to believe there is such a thing). Having earlier used the famous \\"twins paradox\\" to discuss time dilation, Davies reprises twins Ann and Betty in chapter ten, but now they are employing tachyon beams to violate special relativity (and receive messages before they are sent). The obvious problem is that the tachyon signals are 'sent' and 'received' by subluminal observers. This, on its face, is crazy, much crazier that the usual descriptions involving observers beyond the horizon of a black hole, for example (sure, they would be gravitationally obliterated but their theoretical observations themselves constitute a valid thought experiment, well, sort of). As Davies has already told us, tachyons (superluminal particles that probably don't exist) must have a minimum speed limit, Einstein's relativity does not exclude them so long as they are --always-- faster than the speed of light. The cosmic speed limit cannot be transgressed in either direction. If tachyons are to be employed by subluminal observers, they must either be a pure fiction or else special relativity is wrong! I know of no evidence that special relativity is wrong, and no credible evidence that tachyons exist. So how useful is such a thought experiment? Well, we might say that Davies is only trying to construct an illustration -- indeed he is -- but it's a rather silly one, and I suspect he might agree.<br />Davies often tries to present all competing ideas as if he somehow finds all of them to be alternately compelling (or all uncompelling?). Obviously, he's a bright guy, he knows he must be talking nonsense part of the time. Eventually he offers his own judgment: \\". . . at the end of the day I am forced to agree with Eddington and Penrose that we are missing something important from the physics of time and our perception thereof.\\" (p276)<br />If chapters 9-13 should start to drive you nuts, you might consider leaping to the summary questionings in chapter fourteen. Sci-fi aficionados will want to read the discussions of time-travel in chapter eleven (nothing startling here for readers conversant in the topic).<br />Three stars? Four? Five? Well, the treatment is thorough enough (perhaps too thorough on some points), and some fuzzy [counterintuitive] concepts are lucidly explained. This is neither Davies' best or worst effort, but closer to the former.r readers conversant in the topic).  Three stars? Four? Five?

You'll get a better discussion of quantum theory in his volumes 'Superforce', 'The Matter Myth' or 'About Time' and a better treatment of philosophical and theological considerations in his award-winning 'The Mind of God'.<br />Davies is one of this reader's favorite science writers, but I'll not recommend this volume. Your time will be better spent reading any of the four books that I mentioned above. Developments of the past twenty years have countered some of the cosmology presented here, but this is nothing to hold against the author, it is what happens in science. Rather worse is Davies' understanding of theology, it is strangely uninformed for someone with his apparent interest in the discipline. On several points he is dealing with mere straw men.<br />One of several problems is Davies treatment of theology's famous 'cosmological argument' which has been variously employed by such thinkers as Aristotle, Leibniz, and Swinburne. In this discussion (third chapter) he appears to accept that Bertrand Russell had succeeded in defeating the general argument through the introduction of his famous \\"sets of sets\\" paradox. The argument is this: if the cause-effect relationships within the temporal universe are taken as sets of relationships, then the universe as a whole is the set of these sets. Russell then demonstrated, using the 'library books / catalogs of library books' paradox, that the universe itself need not be subject to the rules of causal relationships that apply within the universe. The reason, Russell argued, that causal relationships should not be applied to the universe (as a set of sets) is that causal relationships within the universe (space/time) must have an aspect of temporal sequence, and that since there can be no temporal quality such as \\"before\\" \\"before\\" time itself, the universe need not be caused.<br />That there is no sequence outside of time is hardly arguable. But when Davies goes on to say that we must think in terms of \\"beyond, not before\\" the universe, he demonstrates that the supposed problem is simply one of reckless semantics. After all, just as 'before' is a temporal concept, 'beyond' is a spatial concept; perhaps there cannot be a \\"beyond\\" the universe either? Davies would (rightly) respond that \\"beyond\\" does not necessarily involve a spatial quality, for example we might speak of a concept or understanding being \\"beyond me.\\" And as Davies later explains, in his consideration of 'mind', ideas (say, the calculus or a Beethoven symphony) do not, in essence, exist spatially (or temporally, the piece of music does not cease to exist when the orchestra finishes), yet certainly do exist \\"beyond\\" the concert hall or the notations on paper. Similarly, of the \\"super-existent Being,\\" the theologian says, \\"Cause of all existence, and therefore itself transcending existence\\" (to cite ancient language), causes space-time from \\"beyond\\" [or conceptually \\"above\\"] space-time, not from temporally \\"before\\" it. As Davies concedes, theologians (notably Augustine) discerned this many centuries before Russell attempted to colonize causal language. There are several definitions that logicians have assigned to the concept of causality; Aristotle's most straightforward definition is simply \\"explanatory factor.\\" Russell's argument based on a temporal baseline presents no clear paradox for a supra-cosmic Mind; most philosophers have rightly rejected his demand that we restrict explanation to his preferred language, and it is unclear why Davies was so uncritical on this point.<br />Concluding this discussion, Davies says that we can imagine an uncaused universe -- or even a steady-state universe (although the idea fares poorly against observation) -- but eventually concedes that we cannot finally explain such things in any scientific or otherwise rational way: \\". . . Swinburne writes: It would be an error to suppose that if the universeis infinitely old, and each state of the universe at each instant of time has a complete explanation in terms of a previous state . . . (and so God is not invoked), that the existence of the universe throughout infinite time has a complete explanation, or even a full explanation. It has not. It has neither. It is totally inexplicable.\\"<br />Davies later revisits causality from the perspective of quantum uncertainty and the superposition problem. He treats this material better elsewhere. In many ways, Polkinghorne's 'The Quantum World' (written at about the same time) treats this subject better than any I have seen. The ideas in Davies' chapter on Time are treated more extensively in his later volume 'About Time.'<br />On points Davies strays completely from physics while failing to penetrate philosophy very deeply. A straw characterization of theology's understanding of 'omnipotence' is presented in the consideration of free will versus determinism (chapter 10). Davies cites Hume's argument that God either wills evil (and is therefore not omnibenevolent) or is incapable of eliminating evil (and therefore not omnipotent). Again, the author uncritically accepts Hume's argument, apparently ignorant of the theological response (Hume's argument was not new and some counter arguments had been given two millennia earlier). Davies says, \\"the power of an omnipotent God is without limit, and such a being is free to have whatever he chooses.\\" Actually the statement cannot be true, omnipotence is logically self-limiting in a way that omnipresence or omniscience, is not. For example, an omnipotent Being cannot be free to terminate his omnipotent self, for if he is \\"free to have whatever he chooses,\\" in choosing cessation he could neither \\"have\\" nor \\"choose.\\" Logical limits seem inherent to omnipotence, limits imposed by mutual exclusion. Again, consider the question: \\"is God powerful enough to make a rock so heavy that he is not powerful enough to lift it?\\" The question is supposed to demand a glitch in God's omnipotence. Ignoring that since Newtonian relativistic physics (let alone its advance via Einsteinian fields), the picture being painted is physically nonsensical, it is also logical nonsense. Further, an omnipotent being is not free to simultaneously provide and deny freedom any more that he could create a three dimensional spherical (1 surface) cube (6 surfaces), because of logical mutual exclusion. Strangely, after arguing otherwise earlier, Davies reaches such a conclusion in chapter 17. For a technical theological consideration of omnipotence and the existence of evil, one should seriously engage so-called 'possible worlds' theory; for a less technical approach, one must consider the substantive, rather that superficial, essence of often misunderstood words like \\"love\\" and \\"freedom\\" (both are \\"good\\", neither is necessarily \\"nice\\"). And, like quantum entanglement, freedom is so complex as to be fundamentally mysterious to any human observer who would pretend to be its judge, as certain theologians have variously stated for more than 2500 years.<br />Much argument is distilled into little in the book's three closing paragraphs (so what was the point?).

Freud and Lewis never engaged in what we typically think of as a debate. There is only a slight chance that they ever met. Yet they are obvious voices for an editor/ philosopher to use as antithetical worldviews. In terms of influence, as an advocate of atheism and materialism, Freud stands with perhaps only Karl Marx among modern thinkers. In contrast, Lewis is certainly one of the most influential thinkers of theism in the past century. Both are generally respected, perhaps admired, even among their respective ideological contraries; both wrote of their views extensively.<br /><br />Harvard professor of psychiatry Armand Nicholi has for several years taught a philosophy class for psychiatry students centered on the opposing arguments of these two 'intellectual giants'. Obviously something of an expert on both Freud's thought and personal life, Nicholi embraces many of the famous psychoanalyst's theories, for example his theory of transference. However, it becomes apparent that he looks less favorably on other of Freud's ideas, and in this he is hardly unique. Few psychiatrists would completely endorse Freud's ideas, and few would completely reject them.<br />The author is equally interested in the thought and personal life (thought will likely have some bearing on personal life, and vice versa) of C.S. Lewis. Both Lewis and Freud were given to wrestling with the \\"big questions\\" -- the [supra]existence of God and the meaning of life. As a young Oxford don, Lewis adopted Freud's materialistic worldview, maybe more strongly than even Freud did. Later, in his early thirties, Lewis rejected Freud's answers to the big questions and went on to famously argue against them.<br />Some reviewers state that Nicholi expresses a bias for Lewis' view. Indeed Lewis' arguments more specifically rebut Freud's than vice versa. This fact alone does not reflect Nicholi's bias, Lewis was the younger man and had studied Freud. Advantage Lewis. But, in the second section of the book, it is apparent that Nicholi's views are much nearer those of Lewis. If you want to call this 'bias', I'll not argue with you. However, Freud and Lewis take positions that are mutually exclusive, and ultimately, they can't both be 'right'. A moral Absolute either [supra]exists or it does not; the world either traces to an intelligent First Cause or lurches meaninglessly from a hazy infinite regress of 'blind' causes; all love is merely a variation of sexuality or Love is something more fundamentally profound. Either Freud is on the right track or Lewis is. A thinking person must agree more with one than the other. The author does, likely anyone treating these arguments must, readers will. As for myself, I tend to agree with Lewis, although I don't personally subscribe to certain of his arguments. In some important instances, Freud fails to follow his own arguments to their logical conclusion, and Lewis understands Freud's arguments better and Freud does. Psychologically (and logically) speaking, Lewis accounts for Freud's view better than Freud accounts for Lewis'. I don't know that one must be biased to discern this, the arguments are accurately stated. There is no straw man in Nicholi's book.<br />It must be noted that the author does not treat Freud unsympathetically, in fact the reader, whatever his/her bias (or lack thereof, if that is possible), may identify strongly with both men. As to their differences of temperament, of which Nicholi takes note (Freud -- isolated and depressed, Lewis -- companionable and joyful), one might do well to examine the role of temperament in one's choice of worldview as described notably by William James. [While there may be many exceptions to the rule] where temperament leads, thought often follows, something I suspect was a large factor in Freud's views in particular.<br />Regardless of any weaknesses, this is an important book because it speaks to the most important questions of human existence. However, even to say this is important becomes a point in favor of Lewis' view. The question now becomes, is there an actual reason you're interested in this book, or not?  Lewis would clearly argue yes, what could Freud's answer be?avor of Lewis' view. The question now becomes, is there an actual reason you're interested in this book, or not?

This volume, smallish but rigorous enough, may for some students be an insightful supplement to the study of Luke's Acts. However, it is interesting in its own merits, as history/ scholarship and as exegesis.<br />From Klauck's introduction: \\"[W]e now have the possibility of standing afresh in a situation that was a matter of everyday living for the first Christian generations. At the beginning, the Christian faith had to assert itself among the rival religious views which literally competed with one another on the market-place for the favour of the public.\\"<br /><br />\\"Like Philo and Josephus, Luke begins by presenting his material in a form which met the expectations of an educated Greek and Roman public.\\" (p4) Luke, we recall, was a gentile and a scientist (a physician) -- the sciences of the Greco-Roman world being astronomy, mathematics and medicine. It is not surprising that Luke's interests engage the 'marketplace of ideas' in which Christianity grew in spite of resistance on all sides. While his approbation of the apostles is evident, his Acts of the Apostles is essentially documentation, it is not polemic. \\"The primary intention of the Acts of the Apostles as a book is not missionary, but it does portray missionary history, as an inspiration to the reader.\\" (p121)<br /><br />Klauck's many interesting considerations include Paul's discourse with the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers in Athens, at the Areopagus, and encounters with practitioners of magic. In the author's summary words: \\"Acts employs dramatic episodes, verbal discourses, summary descriptions of the state of affairs, and narrative commentaries. . . the result is a broad and vivid picture. In the course of the narrative, we gradually encounter a whole series of . . . magicians, astrologers and exorcists . . . a king who does not distance himself sufficiently from the cult of rulers . . . a seer . . . devotees of polytheistic belief . . . philosophers whose curiosity is more noticeable than their academic training . . . kindly barbarians and some genuinely 'noble' pagans.<br />\\"Despite all the criticism of some defective forms, we do not find any heavily aggressive polemic.

George Robinson returned to Judaism as an adult looking for spiritual centeredness, a deeper understanding of himself and his place in the world. He's a journalist, not a rabbi. His writing prowess is immediately evident, as is the fact that he has educated himself extensively in the material he treats. His book is primarily conceived as a broad-ranging educational text and guide for those who departed from the Judaism of their youth but are seeking 'something' or feeling drawn back. The book is actually a unique resource for anyone interested in Judaism. Being just such an 'anyone', Robinson's book is for me too, even though I'm not Jewish.<br /><br />Beginning with a chapter on prayer and ritual, it becomes apparent that the reader will need to familiarize himself with many Hebrew words to appreciate Robinson's discourse. There's no way around it, but it's well worth the effort. The book is so thoroughly interesting that, regardless of the language and length (500 pages plus appendices), it may not seem like an effort at all. Robinson's scholarship is generally exceptional.<br /><br />This reader was quickly struck with how fluid Judaism has proven to be. As the author states, \\"A people's ideas are informed by their history, and vice versa. . . and a lot of this book is about that relationship. . . There are some who would have you believe that Judaism is a transhistorical, immutable system of belief, but that just isn't true.\\"<br /><br />A look at the topics treated might whet your curiosity:<br /><br />1- Service of the Heart: Prayer and Ritual<br /><br />2- Rejoice in your Festivals: The Jewish Year<br /><br />3- Birth to Death: A Jewish Life Cycle<br /><br />4- 613 Ways: Living a Jewish Life<br /><br />5- In the Beginning: The Hebrew Bible<br /><br />6- The Rabbis Said: The Talmud and other Rabbinical Writings<br /><br />7- Jewish Mysticism: Emanations of the Eternal<br /><br />8- The Philosophers: The Continuing Evolution of Jewish Thought<br /><br />9- Beyond the Rabbis: How Judaism Got Where it is Today<br /><br />Appendices (5) and Glossary<br /><br />I expected that I would use the book only topically, that is, to educate myself on Kabbalist mysticism, the Zohar, rabbinical writings, Jewish philosophers (Buber, for example), the difference between Orthodox, Reform, Conservative, and so forth, in a piece-meal manner. In other words, use it as one uses a glossary or encyclopedia, which in a sense, this book is.

This is the third of Muir's books that I have read, the first in several years. Gretel Ehrlich writes in her introduction: \\"[Muir] wrote: 'I should like to live here always. It is so calm and withdrawn while open to the universe in full communion with everything good.' And in so speaking of the place he loved best, described himself.\\"<br />In the inimitable way of John Muir, the book is essentially a journal, in this case of his thoughts and travels in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the summer of 1869. On one day (July 15) he tells of his great desire to look directly down the thousands of vertical feet of Yosemite Falls leading him into a death-defying pilgrimage onto shear rock: \\"If I was to get down to the brink at all that rough edge, which might offer slight finger-holds, was the only way. But the slope . . . looked dangerously smooth and steep, and the swift roaring flood beneath, overhead, and beside me was very nerve-trying. I therefore concluded not to venture farther, but did nevertheless.\\" I'll guess that Muir is the only person to have ever positioned himself on the lip of this great waterfall. Having earlier read of his mountaineering and storm-reveling experiences, even this is not quite surprising. On another day he writes of encountering a brown bear, a housefly, and a grasshopper, and treats them all as being equally fascinating.<br /><br />In a later entry, Muir contemplates raindrops with these words:<br />\\"How far they have to go, how many cups to fill, great and small, cells too small to be seen, cups holding half a drop as well as lake basins between the hills, each replenished with equal care, every drop in all the blessed throng a silvery newborn star with lake and river, garden and grove, valley and mountain, all that the landscape holds reflected in its crystal depths, God's messenger, angel of love sent on its way with majesty and pomp and display of power that make man's greatest shows ridiculous.<br />Now the storm is over, the sky is clear, the last rolling thunder-wave is spent on the peaks, and where are the raindrops now -- what has become of all the shining throng? In winged vapor rising some are already hastening back to the sky, some have gone into the plants, creeping through invisible doors into the round rooms of cells, some are locked in crystals of ice, some in rock crystals, some in porous moraines to keep their small springs flowing, some have gone journeying on in the rivers to join the larger raindrop of the ocean. From form to form, beauty to beauty, ever changing, never resting, all are speeded on with love's enthusiasm, singing with the stars the eternal song of creation.\\"<br /><br />For Muir, the mostly self-educated botanist and geologist, nothing Nature does is anything less than miraculous. Only in our finest moments of insight, revelation if you will, do we see the world as Muir saw it always.<br />[July 12, 1869] \\"We saw another party of Yosemite tourists to-day. Somehow most of these travelers seem to care but little for the glorious objects about them, though enough to spend time and money and endure long rides to see the famous valley. And when they are fairly within the mighty walls of the temple and hear the psalms of the falls, they will forget themselves and become devout.

This is an account of the ability of the human mind to rise above a man's material failures and the external evils that assault him. Boethius (c 480-524 AD), a Roman scholar and philosopher/statesman, has led a life of privilege and influence. He has taken a stand of conscience in support of the integrity of the Roman senate and, in doing so, has taken a stand contrary to the designs of the Ostrogothic king Theodoric. He is imprisoned (and eventually executed), presumably for subversion or treason, on the strength of perjured testimony against him.<br />Boethius laments his adverse 'fortunes' and has a vision in which a majestic woman appears to counsel him. She tells him \\"it is time for medicine rather than complaint,\\" and that he suffers from \\"the common illness of deceived minds.\\" Boethius recognizes her -- \\"I saw that she was Philosophy, my nurse, in whose house I had lived from my youth.\\" The consolations that follow are structured in five books (i.e., chapters).<br />In Book Two, Lady Philosophy examines the nature of the gifts of Fortune. These gifts of Fortune cannot be \\"good in themselves; whatever goodness is associated with them is to be found in the personal probity of those who happen to possess them.\\" In Book Three, evil is seen as merely the absence of the Good, as Augustine of Hippo had earlier argued. In Book Four, the question of whether virtue is rewarded and evil is punished is examined. At first look it certainly appears that evil often succeeds. Here Providence is contrasted to Fate. For this reader, books three and four were rather weakly argued and tedious, although I am always reluctant to say this about a classic work such as this. The strengths of The Consolation are books 1, 2, and 5.<br />Book Five is an excellent consideration of the determinism versus freedom problem. If goodness and evil are pre-assigned by Providence, then God cannot be omnibenevolent; in this view, God has willfully authored and imposed evil. There is no such thing as choice or judgment, no such thing as virtue, and all evil must be traced directly to a perverse divine evil. This is a pill that is almost impossible to swallow.

Tutu, retired Anglican archbishop and Noble laureate, presents his reflections on the work of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission and on his personal insights and problems as the Chair of the TRC. The Commission was conceived as a tool in South Africa's transition from an oppressive apartheid regime to an open constitutional democracy. The lessons are important ones to learn in a world where human abuses continue in many forms and in many parts of the world.<br />Mans capacity for cynical self-obsession, paranoiac blindness to that which he perceives as being outside himself, and for the kind of abuse that arises between himself and his external world -- including his fellow beings, is difficult to come to grips with. Tutu discuses this with as much compassion and dignity as anyone likely can. Something dark lurks near the will of man, manifesting opportunistically, often unacknowledged, in fact unnoticed. Yet, in perceiving it clearly, wisdom informs us that we must resist too easily becoming holier-than-thou; we're not all that pure ourselves. As Tutu reminds us, many times, \\"there, but for the grace of God, go I.\\" The temptation is to respond in kind, injustice for injustice, violence for violence, and obviously, many do respond in this way. There is a better way.<br />Justice, charity, and finally forgiveness, speak to us too, and wisdom will not turn a deaf ear. The TRC was established to, among other things, bring to light the hidden abuses of South Africa's recent history. Many of the violent crimes in question were sadistic, deeply disturbing, and of course, covert. The evidence and details of these atrocities would not be feasible, in most cases, for prosecutors to obtain, meaning that violent crimes and conspiracies would remain untreated. Resentment and suspicion would fester, probably resulting in still more violence. Another result would be that a sound basis for reparation could not be developed. By offering amnesty to perpetrators, many shrouded truths were brought to light, apologies were offered (in many cases sincere no doubt), in the African way of \\"ubuntu\\" forgiveness was often gifted (which is amazing), and the wronged found a measure of healing. It simply could not have happened in a setting significantly different than the TRC. \\"After all, forgiveness, reconciliation, reparation were not the normal currency in political discourse.\\" Here is certainly a model for a conflict-riddled world.<br /><br />\\"As related in the Old Testament, the prophet Elisha and his servant were surrounded by a host of enemies. But the prophet remained strangely calm and somewhat unconcerned while his servant grew ever more agitated. The prophet asked God to open the servant's eyes and the servant then saw that those who were on their side were many times more than those against them. We South Africans have experienced this in our lives -- that the forces of good turn out to be many times more than the forces of evil.\\" p202.<br /><br />Tutu writes with great care, qualifying and clarifying his thoughts, such that he is often given to writing Dostoevsky-sized sentences (50-60+ words). I do not have a problem with this, but it may be distracting to some readers who are used to reading lighter fare. Without reservation, I highly recommend this volume to anyone with an interest in human relations and justice, psychological well-being, conflict resolution, and/or spiritual growth.cion would fester, probably resulting in still more violence.

The book isn't perfect but it's certainly much better than reviews posted in this forum suggest. In particular, the review from Publishers Weekly, though it offers some reasonable critiques, is wrong to conclude, \\"McGrath's material could have been more effectively presented in one well-crafted magazine article.\\" Yes, there is some repetition, especially in the introduction, first two and last two chapters, but no more so than one finds in the writings of Richard Dawkins (whom McGrath takes to task). Dawkins has famously stated and restated some obviously challengeable views, views that he himself takes for granted and has not critically examined. McGrath, with Oxford doctorates in both theology and molecular biophysics, is highly qualified to address Dawkins' polemics.<br />The author states that this book has a twofold thesis: \\"to persuade Christians that they ought to be taking nature a lot more seriously, and anyone concerned with nature that they ought to be taking Christianity a lot more seriously than they have to date. But above all, this book aims to set out the intellectual excitement of engaging with nature and recovering that lost sense of wonder.\\" Although he wanders back and forth between his two stated objectives, McGrath does make his points, and does so without the historical disconnection (and skewed take on Christian ethos) that arises in Lynn White's influential 1967 essay, or the inattentive preaching of Richard Dawkins. As someone who reads more than a little on the issue of the gathering ecological crisis, this reader can vouch that the anti-theistic themes to which McGrath responds have been too often asserted and too seldom challenged. As McGrath argues, the 'Christianity is destroying nature' assertion (E O Wilson being one example among many) is misguided, or worse.<br />Theism (i.e., Judaism, Christianity, Islam, theistic Hinduism, Sikhism, Baha'ism) asserts that humans are liable stewards of planet Earth and that nature is to be revered for its divinely assigned significance; it is quite a different viewpoint that insists that humanity is a quasi-ultimate, yet purposeless, accident of \\"blind\\" mechanism and that all of nature is but an assemblage of meaningless 'selections'. In this view, whatever significance Nature 'has' is fleetingly assigned to it by (Enlightened?) \\"Humanism\\". It is this historically recent and relativistic version of ethics (i.e., Enlightenment modernism, scientism, nihilism, atheism, postmodernism, so-called 'humanism') that has denied ontological reflection and has ideologically underwritten the large-scale rape and pillage of our planet. Throughout much of the twentieth century, the world witnessed, most notably in the Soviet Union, the extent to which an atheistically dominated society will render nature a mere economic commodity, significant first and last for its humanistic quotient. Lynn White accused Christianity of being the most dangerously anthropocentric philosophy of human history -- but it is cold scientism (not to be confused with science) which boasts of \\"unweaving the rainbow\\" and demands that humans answer only to human \\"scientific\\" wisdom (see again E O Wilson). It is this philosophy that has spent the past century blindly unweaving Earth's ozone layer. Christianity hasn't made \\"greenhouse gasses\\" -- scientific \\"genius\\" has. To speak this way, Dawkins says, is just so much belligerent, 'anti-science' screed, but it is simply an unfettered observation. In the theistic view, nature must be respected for its intrinsic significance; in the 'Enlightened' atheistic, and postmodern views, nature must be respected essentially because it suits humanity's material interests and intellectual curiosity to do so (there is nothing 'higher').<br />As to Dawkins paranoiac defenses of (what he calls) science: adducing science's limits and/or scientist's miscues, does not equate to 'anti-science'. Not unless one directly equates science itself with human foolishness. That would be an irrational leap, and McGrath, a trained scientist, certainly does not suggest such equivalence. It seems that very few would. Dawkins does battle with a theistic 'boogie-man' malignancy that exists primarily in his own mind. Why?<br />In debunking a demagogue of atheism of Dawkins' stature, McGrath will be a very unpopular figure in certain circles. His book \\"Dawkins' God\\", not yet available in the US at this writing, will predictably draw the wrath of the smug, 'Enlightened' crowd. So far, McGrath seems to be flying beneath the radar of those who will pathologically reject his arguments. Perhaps this will change, his thesis here surely warrants a broad hearing. This is a book that needed to be written (incidentally, McGrath is kinder to Dawkins, if not Dawkins' ideas, than I may have suggested in this review).<br />Certainly the book could be better. Likely 20 pages could have been eliminated (my Doubleday hardcover edition is 186 pages) while improving the readability of the text. The author's two stated thematic objectives might have been better separated or developed as two books. Nonetheless I rate it as better than four stars, simply because McGrath presents, in a restrained and erudite manner, a set of strong arguments that must be heard.tional leap, and McGrath, a trained scientist, certainly does not suggest such equivalence.

While that volume (FP) is broader in scope, this one sets its sights more narrowly. Neither book precludes the value of the other; both are interesting. QC&C is a rather quick read by comparison, so if theology and physics are not your usual cup of tea, this may be the right choice for you.<br />Sir John Polkinghorne, for those readers who might not be familiar with him, is acclaimed as both a quantum physicist and an Anglican priest/theologian (and he's been knighted [KBE], but isn't everybody on that side of the pond these days?). He has won the Templeton Prize and is a Fellow of the Royal Society. His theological thinking is, for the most part, quite classical, although he conspicuously also holds some process ideas regarding God's relationship to 'time' (this is an area in which many readers -- me, for example -- will respectfully disagree with him). His views are perhaps slightly different from the usual perceptions of the ID school of theistic scientists, which alone might be seen as recommending him as an interesting author.<br />My impression is that the target audience for this book is the Christian reader interested in the science-religion dialog and in questions of freedom and the 'problem of evil.' But I also think this might be a valuable book for agnostic scientists and anyone else interested in these topics. Polkinghorne says, \\"Many people seem to think that faith involves shutting one's eyes, gritting one's teeth, and believing X impossible things before breakfast . . . Not at all! Faith may involve a leap, but it's a leap into the light, not the dark. The aim of the religious quest, like that of the scientific quest, is to seek motivated belief about what is the case . . . \\"<br />Polkinhorne's style is both highly learned and gentle, balancing confidence with cognizance of humanity's unknowing.

Davies is a well-known professor of mathematical physics now retired to writing books explaining and popularizing quantum physics. This is one of his earlier books (1980) and, as other reviewers may have noted, he has since honed his writing skills. Yet, this is an interesting book, particularly, I think, in his treatment of stellar nucleosynthesis, nuclear mechanics, the significance of the strong and weak nuclear forces being what they are, the significance of the hydrogen to helium ratio in the early universe (this having to do with the formulation and ratio of protons to neutrons at a highly specific moment) and other factors relating to the so-called anthropic cosmological principle. Another interesting discussion is of the synthesis and unique properties of carbon. Readers may also find Davies' description and contrasting of the Bohr/Copenhagen interpretation with the Everett/'many worlds' interpretation (of quantum superpositioning) to be valuable.<br />The book's weaknesses I will relegate mainly to its beginning and endings. The last chapter, \\"Supertime\\", an excursion into the Everett view, is, unfortunately, Davies at his least interesting. And it might be noted, though Davies does not, that most physicists continue to prefer the Bohr view to Everett's (and that both may be wrong, for that matter). The last few pages seemed almost tedious to this reader. The other problem that I saw was Davies early tendency to equate \\"theology\\" with vitalism. In this naïve view, popularized by Carl Sagan, one is asked to accept that modern western science emerged triumphantly from polytheistic ('the gods must be angry') cultures, which is simply wrong. Scientific thinking was birthed as Hellenism moved away from polytheism toward an overarching monotheism (Anaxagoras' primordial Mind, Aristotle's First Mover, etc). The thinking was that if nature had been rationally and willfully produced, it must then be reducible to coherent 'laws' which could be rationally understood. As intellectualized, pagan quasi-monotheism gave way to Judeo-Christian monotheism in the following centuries, this thinking was reinforced. The early practitioners, philosophers and patrons of science were not vitalists or shamanists or animists, they were not polytheists or pantheists or atheists or even agnostics. Only within the monotheistic view was nature expected to 'make sense' and only within this view was natural science a rational undertaking. Davies almost got it right without noticing it: \\"This belief in simplicity at the heart of complexity has been a driving force behind scientific inquiry for millennia, and persists undiminished today, in spite of the shocks that, as we shall see, it has received in recent times.\\" (p 19) First Philosophy (natural theology) and natural science (natural philosophy) were something of a twin birth in Greek thought. The former being the underwriter and guarantor of the latter. That there must be an inherent conflict is a rather recent propaganda (played up by both poles, to be sure). In fairness to Davies, I'll point out that by the time he had written 'The Mind of God' (1993) he had begun to approach a better understanding. In the more recent book he writes, \\"the justification for what we today call the scientific approach to inquiry was the belief in a rational God whose created order could be discerned from a careful study of nature.\\"<br />Davies' knowledge of current and historical philosophical aspects of science runs deeper than many people writing on these issues today. Take away the first and last few pages and this is a pretty good book. Even when he's sub-par, Davies is quite good. If I were to suggest inaugural inductees to a science writer's hall of fame, my short list would be: George Gamow, Roger Penrose, and Paul Davies.ntellectualized, pagan quasi-monotheism gave way to Judeo-Christian monotheism in the following centuries, this thinking was reinforced.

Lewis points out that this volume is a defense of the idea of an omnibenevolent God against the 'argument from the existence of pain' and is not conceived as a theodicy. That is, Lewis makes no attempt to separate God from the problem of pain, in fact, apart from certain classic theological ideas, the suffering of 'conscious' beings (humans) cannot be coherently understood as being a \\"problem\\" at all. In an atheistically meaningless universe, the concept of suffering is meaningless, thus the awareness of a pain \\"problem\\" can only be addressed theologically. Although he modestly suggests that others might offer better theological arguments, it seems that Lewis argues plausibly, rationally and soundly. The following sentences present, generally and briefly, one of Lewis' more famous arguments:<br />\\". . . anyone who has watched gluttons shoveling down the most exquisite foods as if they did not know what they were eating, will admit that we can ignore even pleasure. But pain insists on being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world.\\" (p 91) \\"While what we call 'our own life' remains agreeable we will not surrender it to him. What then can God do in our interests but to make 'our own life' less agreeable to us, and take away the plausible source of false happiness?\\" (p 94) \\"How can I say with sufficient tenderness what here needs to be said? It does not matter that I know I must become, in the eyes of every hostile reader, as it were, personally responsible for all the sufferings I try to explain . . . (p 95) \\" . . . [God] is not proud, He stoops to conquer, He will have us even though we have shown that we . . . come to Him because there is 'nothing better' now to be had.\\" (p 96) \\"Those who would like the God of Scripture to be more purely ethical, do not know what they ask. If God were a Kantian, who would not have us till we came to him from the purest and best motives, who could be saved? And this illusion of self-sufficiency may be at its strongest in some very honest, kindly, and temperate people, and on such people, therefore, misfortune must fall.\\" (p 96) \\" . . . but from our present point of view it ought to be clear that the real problem is not why some . . . people suffer, but why some do not. Our Lord Himself, it will be remembered, explained the salvation of those who are fortunate in this world only by referring to the unsearchable omnipotence of God.\\" (p104)<br />Other problems and arguments are treated, but the approach is not exhaustive. Lewis doesn't intend it to be; he merely wants to address certain obvious questions (and he does this quite ably). As I read this I concurrently read J. C. Polkinghorne's \\"Quarks, Chaos & Christianity\\" which addresses the problem of pain as well as the problem of \\"natural evil\\" -- as each relate to the concept of freedom. Some say that Polkinghorne thinks as Lewis would have if he had been a quantum physicist; so if you find yourself agreeing with Lewis or at least intrigued by his arguments, I'll suggest you read Polkinghorne as well.who could be saved?

Here is William James' extraordinarily dispassionate and narrowly empirical and pragmatic examination of a topic that has rarely been treated dispassionately. The reading can be difficult, actually tedious, but James' language is persistently non-colonized (he had little respect for the popular psychobabble buzzwords and delusionally simplistic conclusions of his day [and one expects that this would hold true a century later!]). By standards of 'originality'* (a word that must be qualified) and reputation, he probably remains America's most famed philosopher of mind (which is something of an affliction to his dogmatic detractors). It seems that he was/is America's most famed psychologist/neurologist as well.<br />*(James says of his investigation, \\"Originality cannot be expected in a field like this, where all the attitudes and tempers that are possible have been exhibited in literature long ago, and where any new writer can immediately be classed under a familiar head.\\" Yet, while no single consideration in this work is strictly 'original', the work in sum remains highly unique.)<br />A large sampling of varied religious experience and psychological temperament is scrutinized. Many readers will find the sampling too large (this reader did). As is quickly apparent, a large number of cited experiences are 'extreme' -- we might say nutty. One might think the material is becoming a mocking of religious experience per se, but James warns us not to leap to conveniently simplistic conclusions: \\". . . it always leads to a better understanding of a thing's significance to consider its exaggerations and perversions, its equivalents and substitutes and nearest relatives elsewhere. Not that we may thereby swamp the thing in the wholesale condemnation which we pass on its inferior congeners, but rather that we may by contrast ascertain the more precisely in what its merits consist, by learning at the same time to what particular dangers of corruption it may also be exposed.\\" James finds what might be called the \\"religious temperament\\" to embrace a broad range of opinions:<br /> \\"'He believes in No-God, and he worships him,' said a colleague of mine of a student who was manifesting a fine atheistic ardor; and the more fervent opponents of Christian doctrine have often enough shown a temper which, psychologically considered, is indistinguishable from religious zeal.\\"<br /><br />As a scientist, James proceeds in this study as a strict empiricist. As a philosophical pragmatist (practicably and on the whole, \\"the true is what works well\\"), he finds that objects, after all, can only be considered and \\"known\\" subjectively. To 'experience' a material 'object' or phenomena is to be in an intellectual state that is essentially subjective. Thus, although science is the interrogation of the material world, the \\"truth\\" content of a dogmatic materialism is a pretension at best and a delusion at worst. James says, \\"The further limits of our being plunge, it seems to me, into an altogether other dimension of existence from the sensible and merely 'understandable' world. Name it the mystical region, or the supernatural region, whichever you choose. . . we belong to it in a more intimate sense than that in which we belong to the visible world, for we belong in the most intimate sense wherever our ideals belong.\\" To the extent that \\"religion\\" tends strongly to understand this while \\"science\\" today tends impulsively to deny it, religion may exhibit the clearer vision of reality (and of psychological 'healthy-mindedness'), regardless of science's impressive inventory of material 'facts'.<br /><br />As the author instructs, the reader should patiently wade through these lectures. The conclusions toward which he labors are not generally apparent before they are reached. At points throughout the text, both the 'religionist' and the 'anti-religionist' may believe that James is given to championing their respective positions, only to soon understand him differently. While the study is one of empirical psychology, the conclusions are inescapably philosophical (conclusions always are). The author briefly considers the classic theological arguments (cosmological, teleological, etc) and finds them to be logically elegant, yet less than universally compelling. Where [psychological] temperament leads, thought tends to follow. More compelling to James is a theologic / religious / epistemic warrant that seems highly amenable to (perhaps identical to) so-called reformed epistemology. Dogmatic philosophical materialism is inherently an arbitrarily limited window to reality.

The introduction by editor William Shannon is certainly helpful in terms of explaining what this text is. It was something of a labor of love for Merton who recurrently fine-tuned it for a period of several years. Unless you are interested in the process of bringing such a work to publication, you might be better served to simply leap into Merton's thoughts, which begin uneasily with \\"A Preliminary Warning.\\" If the reader has come to the text \\"intent on 'becoming a contemplative' you will probably waste your time,\\" says Merton, \\"this book in no sense aspires to be classified as 'inspirational'.\\" To gain anything from this study one must immediately recognize the difference between the exterior \\"I\\", bound to sensory influence and desperately false self-seeking, and the interior \\"I\\", the true and hidden self that is free, in God, from exterior desire. The book is an appropriately economical and yet broadly ranging consideration of Christian contemplation -- which the author contrasts early with Zen Buddhism. For this reviewer to dissect the text for the purpose of critical analysis would most likely be misleading. (This might be obvious to any contemplative and to any serious writer and to any serious reader.) Here, then, is a simple view to the texts:<br /><br />From \\"Kinds of Contemplation\\" (chapter 5): \\"In active contemplation, a man becomes able to live within himself. He learns to be at home with his own thoughts. He becomes to a greater and greater degree independent of exterior supports. His mind is pacified not by passive dependence on things outside himself -- diversions, entertainments, conversations, business -- but by its own constructive activity. That is to say, that he derives inner satisfaction from spiritual creativeness: thinking his own thoughts, reaching his own conclusions, looking at his own life . . . in meditation and under the eyes of God. He derives strength not from what he gets out of things and people, but from giving himself to life and to others. He discovers the secret of life in the creative energy of love -- not love as a sentimental or sensual indulgence, but as a profound and self-oblative expression of freedom.\\" p59<br /><br />From Merton's \\"essential elements of mystical contemplation\\" in chapter 6:<br /><br />\\". . . an intuition that on its lower level transcends the senses. On its higher level it transcends the intellect itself.<br /><br />. . . is characterized by a quality of light in darkness, knowing in unknowing. It is beyond feeling, even beyond concepts.<br /><br />In this contact with God, in darkness, there must be a certain activity of love on both sides. . . a liberation of the mind and imagination from all strong emotional and passionate clinging to sensible realities. 'Passionate thinking' distorts our intellectual vision, preventing us from seeing things as they are. . .<br /><br />Contemplation is the work of love . . . a development and a perfection of pure charity.\\" p72, 73<br /><br />From chapter 14: \\"All life presupposes the ability to act, to work, to think for yourself, to break out of the cocoon, to get free from the womb. No life requires a more active or more intense formation, a more ruthless separation from dependence on exterior support, than the life of contemplation.\\" p127to others.

The author introduces himself by describing his Rhode Island boyhood conversion -- from his BB gun to his brother's telescope. He then proceeds to bring the reader along on a rather incredible journey, observing the patterns of feast and flight of the curious migratory shorebird known as the red knot. The annual junket of sorts traces from the southern reaches of South America to the northern reaches of North America, and is nicely summarized in these words:<br /><br />\\"Patagonia and the Canadian archipelago are the antipodes of the cycle, but neither is truly end or beginning. In both locations summer briefly holds a tenuous grasp within the looming shadow of near-perpetual winter, but the knots never experience real winter at any latitude. They always stay just one flight ahead of the nether parts of the calendar, alighting only when and where the larder is full, living out their lives in perpetual spring and summer.\\" (p 115)<br /><br />My usual science reading tends decidedly to physics, which is often thought of as \\"hard science.\\" In physics, the unknowns lead us toward the deepest philosophical inquiries of human wondering (like \\"what is reality?\\"), but the mysteries of animal biology seem rather closer at hand (although this depends, of course, on the observer/ questioner). Ornithologist Brian Harrington observes and speculates, counts and calculates, and often arrives at questions whose answers are essentially mysteries: \\"No one quite understands . . .\\" and, \\"we have very little idea . . .\\" he muses. At every level, nature gently resists our hopeful desire to oversimplify it. Our story here, of the red knots' travels, is told in five chapters. The last chapter [6] considers conservation issues; what can be done and what is being done to preserve critical coastal areas and other wetlands important to migratory birds. The book includes many photographs, which are interesting in their own right, but also illustrate the text. This is a fairly quick read and an interesting one.n interesting one.	2004-09-10

The subtitle reveals what awaits: \\"How Thirteen Unlikely Mentors Helped My Faith Survive the Church\\". And yet it may not be what you expect. I had heard good things among mixed reviews of Yancey's work but had not before read any of his offerings. Having read between the lines, so to speak, I anticipated that Yancey is not to be included among the homogenized surface-dwellers cranking out books on the spiritual life (Christian or otherwise). I was not disappointed. If you grew up in the influence of a church that couldn't practice what it preached (couldn't even preach it right, actually), and/or was preoccupied with its own right thinking and excellent doctrine, such that as a thinking person you questioned the whole thing, Philip Yancey is for you. He treats this problem in the first chapter and doesn't try to insulate himself from the unseemly, dogmatic side of 'fundamentalism', pointing out that his southern 'Christian' upbringing in the 50s and 60s taught him to be a bigot, a racist, a dogmatist, a narrow minded hater. If this leaves you a bit uncomfortable, Yancey succeeds in making his point. Wonderfully, this background leads, in the second chapter, into the life, thought, and work of Martin Luther King, Jr. If you only read the first two chapters, you will be better rewarded than in many entire books.<br /><br />Some of these \\"mentors\\" influenced the author quite directly, that is, they are his friends and/or professional acquaintances (for example Paul Brand, Annie Dillard), some he encountered in their writings (Chesterton, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky), all changed the way he sees the world, himself, the Christian life (M.L. King, Jr). One was not a Christian (Mahatma Gandhi) but was more greatly influenced by many of Christ's teachings than were the narrow minded and self-sufficient Christians he most typically encountered.<br /><br />Critics of the Christian faith sometimes insist that 'faith' must be rigid, unquestioning, blind, self-righteous, non-teachable, cold, smug, backward, etc. And there have long been examples for the critic to point to. On the other hand, Yancey and his \\"witnesses\\" stand against this view. And of course, there have always been those who's faith is not so conveniently belittled, we might begin in the pages of the Old Testament and move forward through likes of Clement, Origen, and Augustine, to the gentle, wise, humble, and often troubled witnesses of the present age.<br /><br />The problems of blindness and arrogance are human problems, after all -- spiritual, intellectual, psychological, and not strictly Christian, per se. I can't say that I feel compelled to read another book in exactly this vein, Yancey's thesis here is sufficiently well presented and, I suspect, is something understood by many Christians who tend to quietly challenge the secular world's handy stereotypes (of Yancey's 'witnesses' we think of C. Everett Koop, for example).<br /><br />Were his Christian faith called to trial, these are the witnesses Yancey would call to the bench. It is intriguing to think who would be on my list, and readers are invited to ponder this question. In summary, it's an excellent book about the life of faith, 'warts and all'.

Leibniz is indeed one of the most important and influential of philosophers and also one of the least examined, perhaps even among students of philosophy. He is most known for his contributions to mathematics, theology, and physics while his philosophical views are most often perceived through Voltaire's popular, but rather superficial mocking of his arguments regarding \\"possible worlds.\\" But Leibniz' \\"best of all possible worlds\\" view is more subtle and robust than Voltaire was willing to see. The argument is not that the world is perfect -- certainly not if taken from any single, topical point of view, but that \\"in producing the universe [God] chose the best possible design, in which there was the greatest variety, together with the greatest order.\\" One may dispute Leibniz' general view and/or aspects of his justification of it, but as Leibniz developed the argument along the lines of possibility, contingency, and necessity, it is difficult to see how one would logically disprove it. It has had to be enough for detractors to declare that they disagree with, or dislike the argument.<br />The famous argument is a recurring thread and summation in this Oxford Philosophical Texts volume edited by Woolhouse and Francks. Here is certainly a book that belongs in the library of any student of philosophy. As is noted in the editor's introduction, a recent biographer has written of Leibniz -- \\"Even if he had only contributed to one field, such as law, history, politics, linguistics, theology, logic, technology, mathematics, science, or philosophy his achievement would have earned him a place in history. Yet he contributed to all these fields, not as a dilettante but as an innovator able to lead the specialists.\\" But even in the reasoning of such a magnificent mind there are problems and weaknesses (which tells us a great deal about philosophy and the human mind!). I won't explore the main difficulties that I found. I share one of the concerns expressed by Antoine Arnauld in his correspondence with Leibniz, as well as a few others.<br />Leibniz draws first from classical schools of thought, the Pythagoreans, Platonists, and Peripatetics (while wise ancient philosophers will always need rehabilitation, they \\"were not so far from the truth, nor so ridiculous as the common run of our new philosophers suppose.\\"). He mostly rejects the Scholastics as well as the popular influences of European thought, Hobbes and Spinoza. With modification, he rehabilitates Aristotle's \\"entelechies,\\" which become his \\"monads\\" (from the Greek, 'monas', meaning unity, or that which is one). A monad is the universe \\"from a point of view\\". Matter is understood as phenomena, not substance. Substance (for example number or mind) is irreducible, matter is a composite. Leibniz' view is amenable to Pythagoras and in many ways to both quantum theory (in the \\"quarks and gluons\\" model, the \\"solidity\\" of matter is merely a phenomena of the gluon force, and voids in space-time are not exactly voids) and to so-called string theories. One might say it is amenable to grand unification theory as well. Leibniz also hinted bluntly of Einstein's Relativity, repeatedly stating that there is no such thing as a physical state of absolute rest, motion, or time, as they are all \\"relativities.\\" Newton, for all his genius, got that wrong (as regards time, that is).<br />I could go on and on, there are many pregnant themes in this collection of essays, articles, and correspondence (for example, \\"the present is big with the future\\"). Trying to keep this brief, I will simply suggest you read Leibniz (but do not skip the excellent introduction in this volume). Histories place him in Newton's shadow, which is unfortunate; as a philosopher, he certainly does not belong there. As regards the comparisons, Leibniz' mathematics was more elegant, his physics more far-sighted, his theology better by almost any standard. It seems he had a nicer personality too. His influence on such divergent thinkers as Kant, Russell, and Plantinga indicates his continuing importance.ers as Kant, Russell, and Plantinga indicates his continuing importance.	2004-08-19

The book is a logical and quantitatively supported advancement of the implications of the so-called anthropic cosmological principle. Not only must a precise array of specific values be implemented if a universe that is stable on a large scale and materially complex is to exist, these same &quot;fine tuned&quot; values are necessary for life, for technological (intelligent) life, and for a viable &quot;platform&quot; for scientific discovery. Such a platform is our home, the planet Earth and its calculably favored location in space-time. &quot;Our argument is subtle,&quot; say Gonzales and Richards, &quot;Earth's conditions allow for a stunning diversity of measurements, from cosmology and galactic astronomy to stellar astrophysics and geophysics; they allow for this rich diversity of measurement much more so than if Earth were ideally suited for, say, just one of these sorts of measurement.&quot; If, as Fred Hoyle famously said, a super-intellect has &quot;monkeyed&quot; with the physics (and chemistry and biology) of our material world, then it likewise appears that this super-intellect has also presented us with unique opportunities for discovering this same precise array of specific values. The particular values that support intelligent life also provide the opportunity for knowledge of these particular values. Thus another in the growing number of &quot;cosmic coincidences&quot;. The theological implications are, in a general sense, obvious to anyone who isn't pre-committed to excluding them. (Gonzalez is an astrophysicist, Richards a theologian and philosopher).<br />The first section broadly quantifies the remarkable &quot;habitability&quot; of our host planet, treating such issues as the role of Earth's plate tectonics in maintaining the carbon cycle; the highly specific advantages of a rotating iron core (meteorological, magnetic, etc); the type and age of our star, the unique advantages of having a &quot;twin&quot; body with the parameters of Earth's moon; the protective function of the neighboring gas giants like Jupiter, and so forth. Also treated are Earth's surprising array of &quot;data recorders&quot; and their importance to scientific discovery. If intelligent beings are to ask questions about the nature of nature, Earth is a strangely ideal place for these questions to be asked.<br />The second section considers the larger cosmos, quantifying the privileges of being between the spiral arms of a large (Andromeda and ours are the largest of the Local Group) and old galaxy, and well removed from the perils of a galactic center. Here also we consider the stunningly precise values required for stellar nucleosynthesis, the necessary advantages afforded to our location in time, the necessity of the fundamental force values being very narrowly &quot;tuned&quot;, and so forth.<br />Building on the quantification considered to this point, the third section examines &quot;anthropic&quot; and design implications, thoroughly debunks the Mediocrity Principle popularized by Drake and Sagan, and presents some general and specific predictions arising from a 'design' interpretation of the measurements and discoveries of the past century (and especially of the past three decades). The authors go on to anticipate and answer contradicting arguments, and in making their predictions they clearly challenge those who won't like their hypothesis. To be sure, some won't like it (the 'purposelessness' and 'mediocrity' faithful). But the inevitable detraction (and outright whining) will arise from personal psychological commitments and not from science.<br />A fascinating book, highly recommended.he protective function of the neighboring gas giants like Jupiter, and so forth.

'The Pursuit of God' is a challenging rebuttal to comfortable, pompously pious evangelicalism, perhaps needed more today than when it was first published. It is a book that deserves the attention of every generation of Christian. Unlike so much of the culturally obsessed pop-religionism packaged and peddled today, Tozer's theology and exegesis are very sound:<br />&quot; . . .the scribe tells us what he has read, and the prophet tells us what he has seen. The distinction is not an imaginary one. Between the scribe who has read and the prophet who has seen there is a distance as wide as the sea. We are overrun today with orthodox scribes, but the prophets, where are they? The hard voice of the scribe sounds over evangelicalism, but the church waits for the tender voice of the saint who has penetrated the veil and has gazed with inward eye upon the wonder that is God. And yet, thus to penetrate, to push in sensitive living experience into the holy Presence, is a privilege open to every child of God.&quot;<br />Tozer on the rejection of self-focus: &quot;Self is the opaque veil that hides the face of God from us. It can be removed only in spiritual experience, never by mere instruction. . . Faith is the least self-regarding of the virtues. . . while we are looking at God we do not see ourselves -- blessed riddance.&quot;	2004-06-30

Well, I hate to ruin it for you, but Davies isn't really telling the reader &quot;how to build a time machine&quot; so much as he is taking advantage of a gee-whiz slice of science fiction fun to build a quick tour of the fundamental theories of modern physics.<br />&quot;So can it really be done?&quot; asks Davies, one of the most frequently cited mathematical physicists of our day. And away we go, flying through the ideas of Newton, Einstein, G&ouml;del, Hawking, and Penrose, and leaping into wormholes in space-time. As we go, the great modern physical theories come into play one after another. Davies is good at this. Quickly treated are singularities, entropy and the arrow of time, the special and general theories of relativity, exotic matter, antigravity, the topology of space-time, quantum uncertainty, and other stuff including a bevy of time-travel paradoxes.<br />To be sure, the author describes time machines that 'might' work. &quot;So can it really be done?&quot; Again, I don't want to ruin it for you. But some reviewers seem to have come up with the wrong answer. Here's a hint, &quot;The purpose of science is to provide a consistent picture of reality, so if a scientific theory produces genuinely paradoxical (rather that merely weird or counterintuitive) predictions, that is a very good reason for rejecting the theory&quot; (p 123). This isn't going to be remembered as one of Davies more important books (I recommend 'The Mind of God' and 'The Matter Myth'), but this is aimed at a different audience/readership.<br />A fun little book.	2004-06-30

These selected works from the writings of Origen (c. 185-254) will give the reader much to contemplate and are complex enough to perhaps frustrate the reader without some foundation in the material. Do not read Origen without first reading the preface (Hans Urs von Balthasar) and the foreword and introduction (Rowan Greer). These are valuable insights into the second and third centuries and the early history of Christian thought. The writings of Origen generated several centuries of controversy in the early church. His ardent admirers included Eusebius, Gregory of Nissa and the Cappadocian Fathers, and Jerome. His ardent detractors included Epiphanius, Theophilus, Jerome (persuaded to change his mind), and the Emperor Justinian. One of the so-called \\"Four Fathers\\" of the Christian church, \\"Origen was as towering a figure as Augustine and Aquinas. . . his overt and hidden influence has proved no less far-reaching than theirs,\\" says Hans Urs von Balthasar as he begins his preface. \\"Whoever seeks access from merely dogmatic faith into that inward realm where we see with the inner eye of faith enters a world of mystery demanding not only intellectual reverence but personal holiness as well. . . Perhaps it can be said that [Origen's] simultaneous viewing of prayer and exegesis . . . of exact philology . . . and the search for the spiritual sense, is the most important aspect of Origenistic spirituality for our present situation. . . . the underlying attitude remains exemplary for us, perhaps more than ever before.\\"<br /><br />Jesus said, \\"wisdom is proved right by her actions,\\" and \\"by their fruit you will recognize them,\\" and \\"the good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him.\\" These thoughts commend to us the influences of Origen.<br />Apart from the Introduction to these selections, I particularly recommend \\"On First Principles: Book IV\\" and \\"Commentary on the Song of Songs\\". Some of the ideas presented in \\"Homily XXVII on Numbers\\" were fuel for his detractors (the 42 steps), along with an oversimplification and misunderstanding of his neo-Platonic deliberating. As Greer says, \\"these difficulties should not be allowed to obscure the main lines of his thought.\\" Origen's spiritually rich approach to exegesis is typified in this passage:<br />\\"Now all these truths, as we have said, are . . . buried in the narratives of holy Scripture, because 'the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field' (Mt. 13:44). Consider very carefully whether this passage does not point to the fact that the soil and surface, so to speak, of Scripture, that is, the meaning according to the letter, is the 'field' filled and flowering with plants of all kinds, while the deeper and more profound spiritual meaning is 'the treasures of wisdom and knowledge' (Col. 2:3), which the Holy Spirit through Isaiah calls 'obscure, invisible, and hidden treasures' (cf. Is. 45:2-3). To be able to find them we need the help of God, who alone can 'break in pieces the doors of bronze' by which they are shut up and hidden.\\"<br /><br />It is said that Origen was the church's first great post New Testament theologian, exegete, and apologist. The doctrinal/ exegetical and theological issues with which he wrestled had not yet been 'resolved' by the church councils of later years (it would be naïve to suggest that some have ever been universally resolved). We might expect that there be difficulty with certain of his understandings. Of course the 'big' problem that has been attributed to Origen, is his supposed idea of the transmigration of souls (an unusual idea in Western thought, but one compatible with certain schools of Platonism). This is the idea that most stirred his opponents. In honest fairness to Origen, we must admit that we don't finally know his ultimate view in this area and perhaps his detractors didn't either. He is known to have changedhis thinking on certain issues as he continued to study and contemplate, and among the texts that have survived, the best evidence confutes the accusation that Origen held this unorthodox view.<br /><br />At the end of his extremely productive life (in Caesarea he virtually reinvented both archival/library science and textual analysis), he was arrested and tortured, and died after being released (this happening when the early persecution of Christians was waning). As he did not die in the custody of his tormentors, there was, in his death, more room for controversy -- as to whether or not he should be counted a martyr. The `mysticism' of Eastern Christianity traces largely to Origen and his deeply spiritual approach to scripture, always looking to philological accuracy, subtleties, and deeper and more theologically and spiritually consistent meanings. Much of his exegesis and theology is present in the writings of Augustine and Christian thinkers down to our day. An honest knowledge of Origen's thought will benefit anyone with an interest in philosophy, theology, exegetics, and/or church history.

Motivated by a reading of E.O. Wilson's polemic, 'Consilience' (1998), studied essayist Wendell Berry brings a sledgehammer to scientism's dreamy enchantment with false absolutes. A review that suggests Berry understands Wilson's argument better than Wilson does is essentially correct. The target is not strictly Wilson or his book, but clearly Wilson's central premise and arguments furnish the springboard for Berry's essay \\"against modern superstition.\\" This is NOT a diatribe against modern science or its methods, as some detractors might suggest. This is abundantly clear in the treatment of Berry's discussions with his friend and associate, geneticist Wes Jackson (A Conversation Out of School). The target here is a vitriolic scientism \\"captured by the dream\\" of a seductive intellectual imperialism. Scientism is not merely a logical fallacy (which it is) or a harmless deception; given science's cultural influence and corporate malleability, scientism is dangerous in that its adherent sees scientists as gods, final diviners of ALL things. One must be a little numb to the lessons of history to insist on such a view, but Wilson does. \\"Enchantment\\", Wilson dreamily calls it. His view of a deistic and deterministic world-machine is evocative of nineteenth century philosophies of science. There is ample reason for sober and critical examination of a cultural priesthood of \\"predictably inept masters\\" (nothing against scientists folks, humans qua humans ARE demonstrably inept, precisely as so many great scientists have testified).<br />As an environmental conservationist (yes, Wilson is too), Berry has seen science heavily employed as a weapon against our planet's wellbeing. The argument he wages is against human ignorance of human arrogance, and not science per se: \\"The only science we have or can have is human science; it has human limits and is involved ever with human ignorance and human error. It is a fact that the solutions invented or discovered by science have tended to lead to new problems or to become problems themselves. Scientists discovered how to use nuclear energy to solve some problems, but any use of it is enormously dangerous to us all, and scientists have not discovered what to do with the waste. (They have not discovered what to do with old tires.) The availability of antibiotics leads to the overuse of antibiotics. And so on. Our daily lives are a daily mockery of our scientific pretensions. . . we seem rather to be leapfrogging into the dark along series of scientific solutions, which become problems, which call for further solutions, which science is always eager to supply, and which sometimes it cannot supply. Sometimes it fails us infamously and fearfully.\\" p 32, 33.<br />A defense of Wilson suggests that he is characterized wrongly in that he doesn't assert that science is \\"good\\" in any absolute sense. I understand the argument, but I must also question it. Wilson understands \\"science\\" as a kind of 'final word' in ALL things (art, love, everything!), as \\"Enchantment\\" (with a capital 'E'), as \\"wonderful\\" and as humanity's final and ultimate \\"religion\\". Wilson asserts that science is \\"the first medium devised able to unite people everywhere.\\" (p269, Consilience, 1999) Sounds exceedingly \\"good\\" to me -- in fact, it sounds dreamily and falsely good, are \\"people everywhere\\" becoming more united? That's at least questionable!<br />Of course science is wonderful, and I agree that it is enchanting too. But it can never logically and by its own methods prove that it is the singular watershed of all \\"knowledge\\", let alone all reality or all truth.

Although this may be an obvious truism, his modest book is a little dynamo. In this wonderfully concise expos&eacute;, Polkinghorne reveals the fundamental tenets of quantum physics. Roger Penrose called this \\"a delightful book written at a popular level but without any misleading over-simplification.\\" Excellent popularizations from Hawking, Penrose, Davies, and others, followed in the wake of this 1984 volume. These subsequent books generally aspire to a broader focus (i.e., they include discussions of classical physics, cosmology, and metaphysics, topics which Polkinghorne barely touches upon) and to a broader readership. TQW features smaller type (8.5 or 9 pt), less leading/spacing, and few illustrations, making it seem relatively small, however it will take about as long to read as Hawking's Brief History of Time.<br />Polkinghorne learned quantum theory \\"straight from the horses mouth, so to speak\\", which is to say from Paul Dirac, and if you only read a few books on quantum mechanics, this should be one of them. (I will go so far as to say if you only read one it should be this one, but if the reader has no previous foundation in the topic, this volume may be rather tough to digest.) The explanation of the superposition principle is presented with economy and as much clarity as can be brought to such an esotericism. Even if you've no previous knowledge of quantum superpositioning, Polkinghorne will equip you to startle your classically minded friends with Schr&ouml;dinger's fabled dead/alive cat paradox.<br />The discussion of the problems with each of the interpretations that have been suggested for quantum theory is very good, as direct and studied as any you will likely find...<br />Like most mathematical physicists, John Polkinghorne is rapt with the deep mystery at the interface of quantum mechanics and the classical world of Newton and Einstein. Like Feynman, he is more fascinated by what we don't know about the world than impressed with what we, in some sense, do \\"know.\\" He brings great clarity and honesty to the nature of what we do 'know'...<br />Conclusions: The more mathematically gifted will want to utilize the appendix but little will be lost to the reader who does not. Here is a soberly studied offering that questions, entertains, and educates in the best tradition of Gamow, Feynman, and Penrose. This outstanding book should be in the library of every science reader, and has this reader's highest recommendation.more fascinated by what we don't know about the world than impressed with what we, in some sense, do \\"know.\\" He brings great clarity and honesty to the nature of what we do 'know'...<br />Conclusions: The more mathematically gifted will want to utilize the appendix but little will be lost to the reader who does not.

Wilson's book is labeled \\"science in the grand visionary tradition of Newton, Einstein, and Feynman.\\" Although the author quickly evangelizes us with a conveniently Wilsonian Einstein, we would do well to consider that actual philosophical tradition of Newton, Einstein, and Feynman. Newton believed, as had Aristotle, that the unity of knowledge is not realized within the disciplines of Natural Science, but might be approached through First Philosophy, and that natural science is, by constitution, wholly disciplined by the human mind and thus wholly theoretical and tentative. Einstein, like his friend Kurt G&ouml;del, being something of a Platonist, believed that there does exist true mystery beyond the grasp of natural science (he saw natural science itself as a spiritual dance with \\"the eternal mystery\\"). Feynman perhaps fought his own battles with a personal scientism, yet he insisted that \\"all of the things we say in science, all of the conclusions, are uncertain, because they are only conclusions. They are guesses . . . and you cannot know. . .\\" Wilson weakly pretends to concur, but his thesis here ultimately pleads that we reject such clear-eyed humility. He has been called Darwin's heir -- fitting in that he has a nineteenth century understanding of what science actually is. He assigns himself the label \\"positivist\\" but seems not to understand what Positivism is. (Please read on. . .)<br /><br />Wilson is a sometimes venerated academian \\"captured by the dream of unified learning.\\" In 'Consilience', he unfortunately parrots some pompous foolishness. Science is not honestly served by donning rose-colored glasses and crowning itself -- inevitably, if \\"not yet\\" -- functionally omniscient (although this idea has a certain popular constituency!). I habitually read science and am fortunate to have several friends who are scientists. My interests often bring me into company with still other scientists. I relate this as foundational to my observation that many scientists have less difficulty accepting the absolutely tentative nature of human knowledge than does Mr. Wilson. Beyond the arrogance concomitant to the general argument of 'Consilience' (i.e., imperialistic institutional \\"science\\" IS the omniscient priesthood to whom all unenlightened inferiors will bow in subjection, even if \\"not yet\\"), it is rife with internal contradiction and both logical and historical failure. Human science is a human discipline. Humans, including scientists, are innately prone to error, narrowness of thought, constraints imposed by personal histories, beliefs, and psychologies, and variously motivated \\"dreams\\" (witness Wilson's). Humans, including scientists, are subject to temporal, cultural and industrial influences and pressures. Within these industrial influences we must include those of academia, i.e., the industry of education and its market-entangled paradigms (the author pretends to understand this, but obviously does not). Human science has never been precisely true or whole, nor is there any purely scientific reason to believe that this is possible, read Feynman in this regard, or Whitehead or Schr&ouml;dinger, or even Wittgenstein whose view of science was essentially opposite Whitehead's. (For contemporary commentary see Paul Davies, Roger Penrose, Thomas Kuhn or, for that matter, nearly any sober physicist.) Human science has historically never gotten to the conclusive \\"bottom\\" of ANYTHING (we still don't have a completed theory of gravitation! or know whether matter is built of point-particles or 'merely' vibration patterns!), nor do we know that, in principle, such a grandiose insight is attainable (even if, at some point, we believe we have attained it). Our presumably most accurate scientific insights (Maxwell's electromagnetic theory or Einstein's energy-mass equation, for example) ask deeper questions that may reach beyond what can be scientifically knowable. Within material science's own dictums remains that which lies beyond the reach of empirical science, which, for example, will never examine the alleged primordial \\"quantum void\\" from which the material world is believed to have fortuitously sprung. Now, suppose the 'holy grail' of material reductionism were captured, the fabled Theory of Everything. It would provide a ground for a self-referenced circle of pragmatic \\"knowledge\\" -- but the ontological mystery would remain, smiling silently in nearby shadows, whispering to those willing to hear, \\"and why, oh mighty genius, do you suppose this IS?\\" Further (and the truth hurts), \\"science\\" has rarely been purely beneficial. Science discovered how to harness nuclear energy but doesn't know what to do with the dangerous waste it creates in doing so, nor what to do with the fact that certain humans desire to apply this discovery murderously. Science discovered antibiotics but doesn't know exactly how they can be used wisely rather than foolheartedly (and dangerously). Although few recognize it, bio-engineered food crops increasingly present a related dilemma. Science discovered various insights with which industry and technology-drunk consumers are now scraping holes in the ozone layer. Parroting convenient bombast, Wilson would blame theism (p 268, Consilience, 1999)! Intimating that such things don't really reflect an endemic ignorance within human \\"knowledge\\" so much as they provide examples of what science does \\"not yet\\" know, highlights a pathological delusion. Wilson's claims here are not grounded in history, in science, in reality, in reason, or in sound logic. Human science is wonderful, yet finally human, and when we humans are most intoxicated with our own genius, we inevitably prove that we are dangerously ignorant jesters.<br />We have barely scratched the surface of the body of error in this thesis. (Please read Wendell Berry's sagacious rebuttal of Wilson's Consilience.) Yes, science is a highly valuable means of approaching and approximating truth, but belief in \\"the unity of knowledge\\" does not logically suggest that human \\"genius\\" can ultimately encircle it. The natural domain of materialism is natural science, the human interrogation of the material world. The appropriate methodology of natural science is reduction. Virtually no one disagrees on these points. Scientism, unsupported by either natural science or logic, demands that this domain and method equate to the whole of reality and evangelizes this doctrine as the sovereign of all knowledge. Sobriety rejects Wilson's delusions of grandeur, pretensions of benevolent genius, imperialism of denied ignorance.<br />This book deserves broad critical attention precisely because it is valuable to see how foolish those popularly seen as wise often are, how unscientific an acclaimed scientist can be. Wilson's \\"dream\\" is that of a happily drunken codger, it will come true the day men become gods -- literally Gods!

Although stating this in their own inimitable ways, neither of them were the first to see this. Jesus Christ taught in parable (allegory), explaining to his disciples that he did so for this very reason. The philosophy of scriptural exegesis that looks to deeper, allegorical / figurative, and spiritual meanings was certainly known, practiced and esteemed in the Judaic world which Christ entered. It is singularly prominent in Philo and, we might argue, is instructed a thousand years earlier by Solomon. Strongly influenced by the life and work of Origen (who is often credited, rightly or wrongly, with systematizing this ancient approach to exegesis) Gregory of Nyssa is one of the church &quot;Fathers&quot; and early theologians to teach this approach to scripture. Much of his work is perhaps known only to scholars, and his &quot;Life of Moses&quot; is one of his few works to be now available in an English text. For this we thank the Paulist Press.<br />Moses is seen by Gregory (c. 332-395) as a spiritual model. While he was very literally the historical personage who led the Hebrews out of Egypt, the history centered around him is not merely or purely a history. It is seen as a series of lessons and spiritual insights on a more or less historical armature. These kinds of statements from Gregory demonstrate the influence of Philo and Origen in particular: &quot;How would a concept worthy of God be preserved in the description of what happened if one looked only to the history? . . . Where is the holiness? . . .How can the history so contradict reason? Therefore, as we look for the true spiritual meaning, seeking to determine whether the events took place typologically, we should be prepared to believe that the lawgiver has taught through the things said.&quot; (II.91-92)<br />Many modern / post-modern men and women live their lives on or near the surface, so to speak, in a world of familiar and unquestioned illusions. Many modern Christians do the same. While these individuals might not esteem (or even trust) Gregory's approach to scripture, a merely 'surface' or wholly 'literal' reading will have to embrace dire internal contradictions. Gregory says, &quot;. . . faith in Christ does not ally itself with those of such [irrational] disposition.&quot; (II.98)<br />I once heard a fundamentalist preacher, bristling defiantly, proudly pronounce (while actually thumping his Bible), &quot;I don't interpret the Bible, I just read it!&quot; Could we tell him that in demanding there is nothing deeper to be seen he has made an interpretation? He doesn't seem to notice, I guess God's already told him all there is to know?! Wow.<br />But &quot;arrogance is slain by humility.&quot; (II.15) Passages from this work of Gregory that might profit our Bible-thumper, should he permit it: The Wealth of Egypt.

The valley glows.&quot;	Of himself, Wendell Berry says, &quot;I am an amateur poet, working for the love of the work.&quot; My own reading tends not to poetry but to philosophy, physics, exegesis, and related works in which language serves quite differently. And yet, whether reading Aristotle or Wendell Berry, it is inescapable that words are ultimately only allegories for much larger ideas. Perhaps in poetry this fact is embraced and romanced while in philosophic and scientific work it is ever a 'problem' to be rather embroiled in. Well, I am an amateur critic, but if the poetry in this volume is the work of an &quot;amateur poet&quot; I say why bother with &quot;professional&quot; poetry? If in fact there is such a thing, what more could it offer?<br />Berry is a farmer, a tender of fields and flocks and fences. Of course he is also a highly regarded poet; a man of soil and art and meditation. In this collection his recurring themes include: The importance of honest labor and the importance of rest and contemplation, &quot;the standing Sabbath of the woods&quot; as he calls it; the nature and passing of time, the connectedness of ourselves to our histories and of matter to spirit. Recurring metaphors of light falling into darkness and light arising from darkness, of life fading into death and of life arising from death, have both material and spiritual meanings. . .<br />&quot;His passing now has brought him up<br />Into a place not reached by road,<br />Beyond all history that he knows,<br />Where trees like great saints stand in time,<br />Eternal in their patience. Loss<br />Has rectified the songs that come<br />Into this columned room, and he<br />Only in silence, nothing in hand,<br />Comes here.

Dallas Willard is rightly seen as one of the finest theologians of our day. Philosopher (USC) and philologist, he is a sagacious student and teacher of Christ's invitation to citizenship in The Kingdom Among Us, \\"the kingdom of the heavens.\\"<br />\\"The Divine Conspiracy\\" may be one of the most powerful and accessible works of exegesis written in the past century. As Richard Foster has said of the book, it may, in some sense, stand with even the great works of Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas. Such praise seems too lofty until one has ventured into Willard's exposition. The book is rigorously and beautifully organized, and astonishingly broad in scope. To be sure, this has more than a little to do with Willard's logic and language skills, but mostly it is because he does such a wonderful job of examining and explaining Christ's teachings, particularly focusing on the so-call Sermon on the Mount. (After previewing Christ's manner of teaching and describing the topography of the location, Willard refers to it as The Discourse on the Hill). Willard wisely leads the reader toward the mysterious profundity of the Discourse by first explaining the serious inadequacies of the \\"sin management\\" poles of the Christian \\"right\\" (Bible-thumpin', bumper-sticker faith) and \\"left\\" (the exclusively material, social gospel). This alone is a highly important treatment, but Willard is only prefacing a journey into deeper waters. Before traveling into the Discourse, the author's significant philological insights illuminate certain poor translations of scripture and, most particularly, what rightly was (and is) meant in language concerning a God of/in \\"the heavens\\", and \\"the kingdom of the heavens.\\" The final preface to his examination of Christ's teachings is an argument as to why these teachings beg our attentions. Jesus Christ, \\"the master of molecules\\", is uniquely seen as the most intelligent man to have ever lived on Earth. He was \\"nice\\" essentially because he was \\"brilliant.\\" (If he was truly who he and his followers say he was, how could we think otherwise? His knowledge of nature would transcend the 'uncertainty principle' and Einstein's energy/matter equation, and his knowledge of the human mind [i.e., heart, will, psyche] must be unmatchable.) The strength of this view grows greater upon closer examination and, upon reflection, it is rather odd that few have thought of Christ in this way. Having laid this sound foundation, the author at last turns to the wisdom and beauty of the Discourse itself.<br />This reviewer found a point or two of disagreement with the author (as is nearly always the case, regardless of subject), but the book as a whole is simply too beautiful, wise and true for me to capture in my own words. I will cite passages from the text which will speak for it better than I obviously could. This of rejecting obsession, anger, and the violence done within one's selfish \\"heart\\":<br />\\"And in every situation we have the larger view. We are not passive, but we act always with clear-eyed and resolute love. We know what is really happening, seeing it from the point of view of eternity. . . We can be vulnerable because we are, in the end, invulnerable. And once we have broken the power of anger and desire over our lives, we know that the way of Christ in response to personal injury and imposition is always the easier way. It is the only way that allows us to move serenely in the midst of harm and beyond it.\\" (p181)<br />And this having to do with withdrawing from condemnation, \\"that you be not judged\\":<br />\\"Now a moment's reflection is all that is required to make one realize how terribly powerful condemnation is. It knifes into vulnerable areas at the core of our being. That is why it hurts so badly and at the same time why we rely upon it so heavily. The decision to step aside from it, neither giving it nor receiving it, is a major turning point in one's life. If, as Christians say, we are really 'different' as followers ofChrist, this is a point where it should be most obvious. We would not condemn, nor would we 'receive' condemnation directed upon us. Of course more than half of the battle with condemnation is won once we have given up anger and contempt. Condemnation always involves some degree of self-righteousness and of distancing ourselves from the one we are condemning.\\" (p221)<br />\\"This explains why discriminating against people because of the kind of person they are, their identity, is so hateful and destructive. It also explains why the gospel of the kingdom has such transforming power in human life.\\" (p222)<br />A visionary and transforming book to be meditated upon -- take your time with it.oint where it should be most obvious.

A thoughtful reading of &quot;The Faith of a Physicist&quot; will be particularly valuable to philosophical materialists whose &quot;skepticism&quot; of Christian theism should itself be exposed to skeptical consideration. As Polkinghorne explains, dismissals of theism are often couched in convenient but ignorantly simplistic characterizations: &quot;Scientists who are hostile to religion tend to make remarks such as 'Unlike science, religion is based on unquestioning certainties' [Wolpert]. They thereby betray their lack of acquaintance with the practice of religion. Periods of doubt and perplexity have a well-documented role in spiritual development . . . Religion has long known that ultimately every human image of God proves to be an inadequate idol.&quot;<br />Considering metaphysic's classic poles of dualism versus monism, the author is inclined to reject each in preference to a &quot;dual-aspect monism.&quot; In this he is not particularly controversial, nor in his interpretations of quantum theory in terms of its philosophical implications. Polkinghorne's biblical exegesis will be controversial on certain points (whose isn't?). Although he is sometimes accused of being a process theologian, it seems clear that he is not. His theology is ultimately rather classical, including certain elements of process (&quot;There are aspects of Whitehead's thought from which one can benefit without accepting it in its entirety&quot;) and what he calls a &quot;tinge of deism&quot; (recognizing that the cosmos was indeed &quot;wound-up&quot;). If the reader thinks that one must either demand that Christian scripture is inerrant or reject it as being errant, then Polkinghorne will offer him/her no satisfaction. In fact, all readers will be rather challenged.<br />(Regarding dual-aspect monism and David Bohm's metaphysics arising from his interpretation of quantum theory): &quot;My instinct as a bottom-up thinker is to be wary of such grandiosities of philosophical fancy. Instead, I would want to follow the flight of such straws in a metaphysical wind as our understanding of the physical world provides. My own tentative ideas have been woven round two concepts: complementarity and openness.&quot; In other words, something like the particle-wave duality and something like the ordered-disorder of the so-called chaos theory.<br />(Regarding Stephen Hawking's suggestion that his &quot;no boundaries&quot; model displaces the need of a creator): &quot;. . . theology is concerned with ontological origin and not with temporal beginning. The idea of creation has no special stake in a datable start to the universe. If Hawking is right, and quantum effects mean that the cosmos as we know it is like a kind of fuzzy spacetime egg, without a singular point at which it all began, that is scientifically very interesting, but theologically insignificant. When he poses the question, 'But if the universe is really completely self-contained, having no boundary, or edge, it would have neither beginning nor end: it would simply be. What place, then, for a creator?' it would be theologically naïve to give any answer other than: 'Every place - as the sustainer of the self-contained spacetime egg and as the ordainer of its quantum laws.' God is not a God of the edges, with a vested interest in boundaries.&quot;<br />Polkinghorne uses statements of faith taken from the Nicene Creed as a springboard for his apologetic. He offers a &quot;non-literalist&quot; defense of the doctrine of divine creation that assumes a general correctness to present cosmological and evolutionary theories but also finds them to be unexplained apart from the Divine action of an intelligent will. While questions certainly remain unanswered within the theistic view, the materialistic alternative is seen to provide no ultimate answers at all. He offers a defense of Christianity's doctrine of &quot;eschatological destiny&quot; which sees the &quot;optimistic arrow of time&quot; (Davies term for complexity in spite of entropy) and entropy's &quot;pessimistic arrow of time&quot; (second law of thermodynamics) as vectors converging in a significantly unique event. He offers a defense of New Testament uniqueness and reliability (not inerrancy); and a strong defense of the uniqueness of Jesus Christ. He argues that, when all is considered, the claimed resurrection of Christ is more credible than any alternate theories that have been proffered but which fail to explain subsequent events. Polkinghorne offers a defense of the doctrines of the Trinity and of eschatology, and concludes with thoughts of alternative views. If you find the last chapter (Alternatives) to be too brief, Sire's &quot;The Universe Next Door&quot; may be of further interest. In the course of the text here, Polkinghorne argues for a bold and far reaching teleology including, but not restricted to, physical theory, embracing &quot;the natural theology of the arts&quot;. He argues also for a boldness in defending the authenticity of the canonical Christian gospel; a boldness not simply based in unquestioning fideism but arising from the best documentation of ancient history and human experience. In sum, it makes for a difficult but fascinating read.ll.

Paragraphs will continually ask to be reread. Thomas Merton's perspicacious meditations, offered with such poetic strength, are to his reader like veins whose rich ore leads the miner deep. The effort is real and so too is the reward. Merton (1915-1968) was a contemplative monk, a Trappist, and although most of his readers may think themselves of another world, so to speak, it is the world of which Merton writes which is Real, and the clabbering, self-directed world of our common experience that is illusory.<br />A few thoughts, ones that are obviously directed more narrowly toward other Catholic monks, may generally be less helpful to most readers (I think of basically one chapter). I could offer other minor detraction but it would probably only amount to vanity on my part. It will be more valuable to meditate on these words of Merton:<br />&quot;Those who love their own noise are impatient of everything else. They constantly defile the silence of the forests and the mountains and the sea. They bore through silent nature in every direction with their machines, for fear that the calm world might accuse them of their own emptiness. The urgency of their swift movement seems to ignore the tranquillity of nature by pretending to have a purpose. The loud plane seems for a moment to deny the reality of the clouds and of the sky, by its direction, its noise, and its pretended strength. The silence of the sky remains when the plane has gone. The tranquility of the clouds will remain when the plane has fallen apart. It is the silence of the world that is real. Our noise, our business, our purposes, and all our fatuous statements about our purposes, our business, and our noise: these are the illusion. God is present, and His thought is alive and awake in the fullness and depth and breadth of all the silences of the world. The Lord is watching in the almond trees [Jer 1.11, 12]. . . Whether the plane pass by tonight or tomorrow . . . whether the liner enters the harbor full of tourists or full of soldiers, the almond tree brings forth her fruit in silence.<br />&quot;There are some men for whom a tree has no reality until they think of cutting it down . . . men who never look at anything until they decide to abuse it and who never even notice what they do not want to destroy. These men can hardly know the silence of love: for their love is the absorption of another person's silence into their own noise. And because they do not know the silence of love, they cannot know the silence of God . . . Who is bound, by His own law of Charity, to give life to all those whom He draws into His own silence.&quot;ass by tonight or tomorrow . . . whether the liner enters the harbor full of tourists or full of soldiers, the almond tree brings forth her fruit in silence.<BR>&quot;There are some men for whom a tree has no reality until they think of cutting it down . . . men who never look at anything until they decide to abuse it and who never even notice what they do not want to destroy.

To my mind, such as it is, Sire's Habits of the Mind begins rather feebly -- the author relates personal experiences of coming of age in a salt-of-the-earth and decidedly &quot;anti-intellectual&quot; home environment. He describes his college-aged self as an &quot;intellectual wannabe&quot;. I nearly dismissed the book after the first few paragraphs, but, entirely based on my high opinion of the author's The Universe Next Door, I pressed on. In chapter three, the author finally turns to the themes he presents best and begins to achieve the kind of resonance that characterizes that earlier volume. Opening the tenth (final) chapter, examining the concept of intellectual responsibility, Sire reflects on his &quot;wannabe&quot; confession and offers another: &quot;Being an intellectual is after all . . . nothing to particularly admire or condemn.&quot;<br />This of ideology: &quot;Truth cannot be constructed. To live in ideology is, as [Vaclav] Havel so eloquently reminds us, inevitably to live in a lie. Truth can only be revealed. We cannot be creators, only receptors.&quot;<br />And this of humility: &quot;Without [humility] every virtue begins to become a vice. A passion for truth becomes a certitude that we . . . now possess it. . . Lack of humility -- arrogance -- is, in fact, one of the most frequent charges against intellectuals. Sometimes this charge can not be avoided . . . The real problem, however, is not the charge that you are arrogant but the distinct possibility that you actually are. Self-examination is always in order.&quot;<br />Quoting Richard John Neuhaus: &quot;Few things have contributed so powerfully to the unbelief of the modern and postmodern world as the pretension of Christians to know more than we do. . . If Christians exhibited more intellectual patience, modesty, curiosity, and sense of adventure, there would be fewer atheists in the world, both of the rationalist and postmodern varieties.&quot;<br />Endure the first two chapters -- it gets better. As an examination of intellectual curiosity and intellectual courage, as these may be for some &quot;a Christian calling&quot;, this is a very good, if not quite great, volume. In fact there are many `quotables' here that may remind the reader of Pascal's Pensees. A minor flaw: the volume (2000) contains a few more `typos' than most books. Perhaps a dozen or so where one might typically expect 2 or 3. Particularly noticeable given that the author is a long-time editor. But the thought here is less flawed than the proofing; for many books it is the opposite. The consideration of &quot;reading directed thinking&quot; versus &quot;thinking directed reading&quot; is quite valuable.<br />This of the theistic view of knowledge: &quot;Our knowledge of God, our theology, is itself a boon to our knowledge of the universe. . . In other words, because God is the all-knowing knower of all things, we -- being made in His image -- can be the sometimes knowing knowers of somethings. . . All this is a gift of God, a 'supernatural charity'. . . it is not the 'autonomy of the human intellect,' our own or that of anyone else.&quot;<br />Recommended reading although not for all readers.r.

Roger Penrose, \\"one of the world's most knowledgeable and creative mathematical physicists,\\" presents in his 1989 Emperor's New Mind one of the most intriguing and substantive popularizations of mathematical logic and physical theory that has ever been published. As a reader of many books written by scientists, I will say that few compare with this one. Penrose wrestles with what he sees as some of science's most inadequate or poorly developed (although popularly accepted) ideas. As certain physical theories are found wanting, his grapplings extend to some of the deepest questions of metaphysics. Of the deepest questions, Penrose says, \\"To ask for definitive answers to such grandiose questions would, of course, be a tall order. Such answers I cannot provide; nor can anyone else, though some may try to impress us with their guesses.\\" While he speaks respectfully of individuals with whom he has certain differences of opinion, the \\"some\\" in that statement might be taken to be Hawking, Dawkins, Dennett, to suggest a few. The author here tends toward a more humble and questioning approach. Penrose's puzzlings are complex, creative, and speculative, and even his admirers might easily misrepresent certain of his opinions and conjectures. A case in point may be the fact that he finds cosmic inflation theories to have less explanatory power than others claim for them -- this doesn't mean he necessarily rejects inflation, rather he doubts claims that inflation significantly helps explain the specialness of the early universe. Positivists may be disposed to discount the problem but there appears to be good reason for Penrose's skepticism. However this is not treated in this volume.<br /><br />Rigorously building a case against the fundamental arguments for strong AI, Penrose begins with what for him is to ultimately be 'le coup de grâce', considerations and arguments from mathematical logic. If the human mind works non-algorithmically, then we know of no way to digitize/program its processes. The mind does in fact function non-algorithmically, a fact demonstrated without much difficulty. It learns in intuitive, non-linear, and mysteriously creative ways. The idea that some non-algorithmic approach might achieve a program equivalent to the human mind is not supported by any \\"useful\\" (or better, see below) physical theory and is not mathematically tenable. Strong AI is thus relegated to a mere ideological preference (and obviously to sci-fi). In his mathematical considerations, Penrose is most interested in the work of Turing and G&ouml;del and in the Platonic essence of mathematics itself. Concluding that the human mind cannot be reduced to an algorithm (or any set of algorithms), Penrose next questions whether the mind might be reducible physically. Here he finds the questions and answers less well defined than he has in mathematics. His tour of classical and quantum physics features interpretations and ideas that many readers may have not encountered (which makes the text fun). The problem of \\"correct quantum gravity\\" (that is, the incompleteness [or incorrectness?] of relativity and quantum theories) is one that Penrose and other theoreticians have struggled with for decades. Penrose wonders if this mysterious and conspicuously missing physical theory might be related to the also conspicuously missing science of mind. This speculation on his part is the theme also of his more recent books. As Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger (like Einstein and G&ouml;del, Platonists all) seems to be one whose ideas are of particular interest to Penrose, I will cite Schr&ouml;dinger's view: \\"Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else.\\" But Penrose doesn't quite argue this view, although it would seem an obvious conclusion from his best arguments. Here is a classic example of how we may know 'something' without knowing everything: we can know that the human mind cannot be reduced to an algorithm -- or algorithm of algorithms -- and yet it is not known whether we can even know precisely what mind is. Particularly so if, as Schr&ouml;dinger says, mind is irreducible.<br /><br />The chapter on cosmology is excellent, as one might expect of a Roger Penrose. The consideration of the \\"specialness\\" of the initial [cosmological] conditions and of the relationship of this specialness to the second law of thermodynamics is also fascinating as it is precisely the second law that lends the \\"arrow of time\\" its apparent non-symmetrical aspect -- in other words, defines physical reality as we experience it. In this sense, the second law connects the human mind to the cosmos (which is interesting but does nothing to help us \\"reduce\\" mind).<br /><br />Penrose suggests, and I cannot find any reason to disagree, that all scientific theories can be assigned to one of three broad categories, which he calls: (1.) SUPERB, (2.) USEFUL, (3.) TENTATIVE. All SUPERB theories (there are roughly a dozen) stand within the purvey of physics, and: \\"It is remarkable that all the SUPERB theories of Nature have proved to be extraordinarily fertile as sources of mathematical ideas. There is a deep and beautiful mystery in this fact: that these superbly accurate theories are also extraordinarily fruitful simply as mathematics. No doubt this is telling us something profound about the connections between the real world of our physical experiences and the Platonic world of mathematics.\\" Over time, theories (particularly those that do not feature such mathematical beauty or fertility) may tend to move between the categories. Theories held to be SUPERB for centuries have dropped completely from the current categories; theories have faded and re-emerged. . . \\"we should not be too complacent that the pictures that we have formed at any one time are not to be overturned by some later and deeper view.\\"<br /><br />Some readers will not like the fact that, after extensive rumination on very difficult and deep questions (like \\"what is mind?\\"), the author doesn't conclude with a pretense that he, or anyone else, has definitive answers. This reader appreciated the integrity of Penrose's questionings and of his conclusions (or lack of conclusions). I will misappropriate one of Penrose's terms -- as a text examining mathematics, physics, and the human mind, this volume is SUPERB.ced to an algorithm -- or algorithm of algorithms -- and yet it is not known whether we can even know precisely what mind is.

Even fewer, I suspect, have a carefully constructed theology. But everyone has a worldview. . . In fact, it is only the assumption of a worldview -- however basic or simple -- that allows us to think at all.&quot;<br />Sire gives his reader a significant, albeit &quot;basic&quot;, unpacking of several so-called worldviews (a worldview being a presupposed, &quot;more or less coherent frame of reference for all thought and action&quot;). In a highly approachable 200 pages, we find valuable foundational expositions into eight (or 12, if we count specific variants) such frameworks. The author's examinations of Christian theism, deism, naturalism / nihilism, and the ideological spawns of nihilism (including New Age and appeals to Hindu monism and to Zen Buddhism), are obviously not exhaustive. Note the word &quot;Basic&quot; in the book's subtitle. The reader, whatever his worldview, will likely find a point of disagreement with the author. But in its systematic conciseness and scope, you aren't likely to find any other volume that does what this one does in exposing the universe(s) &quot;next door&quot;. Reference notes are extensive, for those who wish to dig deeper. The book (this review is of the third edition) well deserves its continued interest and has been used as a college text in philosophy, comparative religion, history, and English literature courses.<br />Most of Sire's insights are well considered: &quot;[W]hen Nietzsche says 'truth is a mobile army of metaphors' or conventional 'lies,' he is making a charge which implicitly claims to be true but on its own account cannot be.&quot; This is one of those rare books you may want to read again at a later date. . .<br />This of positivism: &quot;If the mind is strictly a 'naturally' produced brain-machine, then human thought is ultimately determined by prior causal mechanisms, which, to fit the philosophic demand of naturalism, were accidental (not intelligently purposed) events, then what is human thought?

We see that whatever thought essentially is, it is inherently referenced to specific events, to the exclusion of other possible histories to which it is not referenced. In other words, human thought is merely the accidental 'secretion' of accidental histories; that is to say human thought is programmed by natural evolution and has no other reference, and can thus posses little epistemological integrity. As Nietzsche argued, no human thought could be known to resemble truth, and even if it did we could not distinguish this 'truth' from the usual delusions.

Two-dimensional \\"worlds\\" exist within ours, if only in a somewhat pragmatic sense. If we imagine some \\"thing\\" intellective within such a world, then we have little difficulty seeing that our humble narrator, Mr. A. Square, might be such a world's most insightful oddball. The book is a classic exposition in basic geometry, but it is more than this.  Abbott uses mathematics to make some very telling observations about human minds and psychologies.<br />Edwin Abbott (1838-1926) was a clergyman and a math geek. He was an educator, an expositor of English literature and New Testament studies, a notable headmaster, and the author of something like 40 books on widely varied themes. Today you will probably have a difficult time finding any of his other volumes, but Flatland is said to have never been out of print since it was first published in 1884.<br />No need to retell A. Square's big adventures here, other than this bit of dialog between our two-dimensional thinker and his three-dimensional visitor/teacher (Square is given to thoughts of still higher-dimensional worlds):<br />\\"SPHERE.

A great many volumes, five to ten times as large, conclude having said far less than this little parable. Read it. You will take from it what you are willing to take. If you find little or nothing here, you are indeed a citizen of Flatland.	2003-10-11

You should first note that, when choosing a volume such as this, the quality of the translation is of primary importance. In my experience, one of three publishers who consistently offer outstanding translations of classic philosophical and literary texts is Penguin Classics. To avoid poor translations, please notice reviewer complaints about volumes offered by certain other publishers.<br />In this work, Aristotle first exposes what he finds to be the logical errors of earlier thinkers. Although he recurrently trains his fire even on his old teacher, Plato, Aristotle's system of thought does not finally escape Platonism. This volume presents several major undertakings, [1] Aristotle's logic, [2] his systematic definitions and arguments as to the nature and priority of \\"substance\\", relative aspects of actuality, potentiality, process, differentia, unity and multiplicity, and [3] his theology (First Philosophy). From Book Gamma: \\"There must be some one science that gives an account of all... and that also gives an account of substance... of that which is one qua that which is one and of that which is qua that which is... The shortcoming of current examinations of these topics is not their failure to be philosophy, but the priority of substance, on which the current philosophical consensus has no view. There are affections peculiar to [quantification as being quantification]... in the same way there are peculiarities of that which is just qua that which is. And it is the truth about these that the philosopher is after.\\" While Aristotle is often said to be the ideological godfather of so-called positivism (a particularly dogmatic species of materialism), he would reject the title. So-called positivists tend to proudly insist that they reject metaphysics. The obvious problem with this assertion is that it is itself metaphysical  (as Aristotle would immediately point out). Throughout most of the history of systematic thought, metaphysics has been seen as the supreme discipline (Isaac Newton, the greatest of physicists and mathematicians, found physics and mathematics to be less fascinating than theology, as had Rene Descartes and Blaise Pascal). But the Enlightenment brought with it a rather paranoiac suspicion of pure reason, and especially of First Philosophy. Aristotle would strongly disapprove; \\"It is, however, vital not to overlook the question of what it is to be a thing and the definitional account of how it is what it is. If we leave these out, scientific inquiry is mere shadow boxing.\\" (Epsilon 1)<br />Some discourses of The Metaphysics are surprisingly readable, some are quite esoteric, some are puzzling (perhaps even to Aristotle?). Are Socrates and what-it-was-to-be Socrates identical? The author seems to think yes, at least in some sense. The exhaustive attempts to define essence, substance, and yes, definition itself (in Books Zeta and Eta), serve to demonstrate why many presume to avoid metaphysics. Those who call themselves positivists probably won't read this particular work of Aristotle, perhaps claiming even to be proud that they didn't \\"waste\\" their time with it. Indeed, some discussions seem merely confusing. Book Kappa revisits arguments and questions introduced earlier, and Aristotle presents his fully developed theology, at times elegant and at times incongruent, in the final chapters of Lambda.

Mother Teresa's biographical information is minimal and the book does not canonize her. Apart from introducing the thoughts of volunteers who work with the Missionaries of Charity, her own words are few. What we find are simple views of a simple path, and beauty in simplicity. This is not the story of a famous nun, it is the story of a way of seeing ones world and of living without self-focus. Mother Teresa, and those who work in the missions that she and others have established and conducted, convey an attractive invitation to service to others. The path has been set before us in the Gospels of Matthew (25:34-40) and Luke (10:30-37). This small volume contains no rancorous sectarian, philosophical, or theological arguments. The themes are peace, love, joy, and fearless devotion to the welfare of others. The simple path is well summarized in the words of St Francis of Assisi:<br />\\"Lord grant that I seek rather to comfort than to be comforted,<br />To understand than to be understood;<br />To love than to be loved . . .\\"<br />The book makes little mention of the opposing worldview, but I briefly will. The opposite worldview is the ever-popular celebration of slavery to self. There are, of course, many variations on this theme. One notices how offended, even angered, the culture of self can be when it is rejected, in this case by Mother Teresa. Articles and books have been published which denigrate her, and she has been called a hypocrite. I doubt she terribly cared.

Noted Israeli physicist Gerald Schroeder presents a compelling case that our universe is readily reducible to simply this -- an immaterial wisdom. &quot;The solidity of iron is actually 99.9999999999999 percent startlingly vacuous space made to feel solid by ethereal fields of force having no material reality at all.&quot; And what is that tiny portion of an &quot;atom&quot; of matter that we describe as supposedly being &quot;matter&quot;, that is, the quarks and electrons? They are incredibly precise (i.e., specified) packets of 'frozen' energy, highly tuned to interact with these highly tuned &quot;ethereal fields.&quot; It seems that such objects are essentially intellectual constructs, as are all the &quot;objects&quot; of the so-called particle zoo. We call &quot;something&quot; a quark (or a photon, electron, etc) only because we can assign a certain behavior to &quot;it&quot;. But what is &quot;it&quot;? Apart from saying that &quot;it&quot; is specified information, nobody knows. Within the quantum mechanical framework, these &quot;objects&quot; are essentially mathematical objects. As Einstein told us, what we call matter is merely condensed (&quot;frozen&quot;) energy. And it turns out that energy is merely information. But what incredibly elegant information it is! (If it were not, neither people nor stars nor any &quot;material&quot; thing could exist). The materialist paradigm of our age is decidedly uneasy with the revelation that &quot;matter&quot; is but an elegant creation of a nonmaterial and extra cosmic entity. Why should we have an &quot;Elegant Universe&quot;? Philosophical pre-commitments seek a &quot;blind&quot; non-thing as an explanation, actually demanding a clumsy series of explanations other than the theist's Creator. (Interestingly, this approach is mislabeled &quot;reductionism&quot; and/or &quot;positivism&quot;!) &quot;Consider the 'coincidences'&quot; of nature's wisdom, asks Schroeder, and explanations other than a wise Creator &quot;must seem a bit forced,&quot; even to the atheist.<br />The only detraction that I will offer is that the author subscribes to a kind of 'process theology'. Overall, this may be a minor problem. Schroeder's central thesis is itself elegant (and modestly eloquent, and yes, obvious to anyone who isn't psychologically pre-committed to rejecting it out of hand).uot;must seem a bit forced,&quot; even to the atheist.<BR>The only detraction that I will offer is that the author subscribes to a kind of 'process theology'.

The author's thesis is simply distilled and has often been an overlooked feature of the teleological argument for the existence and nature of God: not only that design is evidence of intelligence and will, but that beauty is evidence of truth. Catholic theologian Thomas Dubay illustrates the connection between beauty and truth. Physicist Richard Feynman said, \\"You can recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity.\\" Einstein regarded the beauty of a physical theory as a proof superior to empirical evidence. Mathematicians have long regarded the beauty and elegance of an equation or mathematical expression as the most necessary indicator of its truth. We have come to realize that nature is ultimately mathematics, beautiful mathematics (Plato was right). Why is reality, at its core, beauty? Whether the equations that describe the deepest features of the quantum world, the fine tuning of the cosmic initial conditions, the highly specified organization of microbiological cell \\"cities\\" (we could go on and on), nature is all about beauty. What does this indicate to the uncallused observer? And what then is the evidential power of ugliness? Dubay contrasts the two contending worldviews: materialism (existence is a meaningless and ultimately absurd accident), or theism (existence is intended, meaningful), concluding that the very ugliness of absurdity is evidence of the falsity of atheism/philosophical materialism.<br />\\"... simple observation shows that people, including academics, readily welcome intellectual interventions and therefore design, when the question is free of cultural biases and does not impinge on their personal lifestyle and chosen philosophy. I find it both amusing and instructive that when scientists come upon evidence in their field (anthropology, for example) that seems to support a theory popular among their colleagues, no one hints that an apparent causal connection was due to random chance. In an archeological dig, if the investigators find a stone so chipped that it could have served as a knife, they conclude that it was deliberately made, that is, designed for that purpose by a human ancestor. Their inference may well be true, but all the same, it is enormously weaker than design in a bird's wing, and fantastically weaker than design throughout any living cell. In the latter, the case for design is overwhelming. When it is rejected, the cause must be due to personal philosophy and bias having nothing to do with science. In more plain language, the rejection has all the appearance of a materialistic dogma that no divine mind must be admitted. This is bad science because it is a position based on a personal philosophy and not on scientific data. The carefully arranged and massive blocks of stone at Stonehenge are a more detailed example of a scientific acceptance of design when such is popular. Their precise positioning is explained, most likely correctly, by the deliberate will to align them to the sunrise at the summer solstice. This likelihood seems stronger than that of the chipped stone, but it remains far, far weaker than the endless examples nature furnishes ... Yes, something less than cool, objective scientific thinking lies behind the rejection of mind behind nature.\\"<br />The science here isn't always precise, but where it is not it seems that Dubay has understated his case. Thus the discrepancies do not damage the author's thesis. The greater flaw to this volume is that the author has presented not only an apologia for the reality of a wise Creator but for the Roman Catholic Church. Cases against atheism suddenly incorporate attacks on Protestants, rock n roll, contraception, etc. If the book had been edited into something more lean and 'on-task' this would be a tremendous book.

As one who has repeatedly mulled over Solomon's Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, I was drawn to this book with no small anticipation. I was disappointed; the exegesis here is pressed into a modern, ad hoc spirituality. Rami Shapiro's \\"contemporary Jewish spirituality\\" is often misspent neo-Taoism. The author's caricature of Solomon's wisdom seems, to this reader, to amount to 'just be contented.' Period. \\"Rejoicing without reason,\\" he calls it. No reason? While Solomon does indeed instruct that it is \\"vanity... meaningless... empty...\\" to pursue the foolishness of the human will, he restrains this indictment to the doings of humanity. Solomon gives us the impermanence of the material, yes, but also the permanence of the Immaterial. Solomon gives us the Source, which is not empty: \\"Notice the way God does things; then fall into line. Don't fight the ways of God, for who can straighten out what he has made crooked?\\" (Eccl 7:13)<br />Lao-tzu was not as uncomfortable with a relevant God as is this \\"contemporary\\" rabbi:<br />\\"Returning to the source is serenity;<br />it is to realize one's destiny.<br />To realize one's destiny<br />is to know the Eternal Constant.<br />To know the Eternal Constant<br />is to be enlightened.<br />To be ignorant of this<br />is blindness that begets evil.\\" (Tao Te Ching, verse 16)<br />\\"But, my child, be warned: there is no end of opinions ready to be expressed,\\" (Eccl 12:12). The Hebrew king/scholar/sage told us of the Source of the contentment that it is important we find now, before \\"the light of the sun and moon and stars is dim to your old eyes.\\" On the final page, Shapiro translates/interprets Solomon as \\"knowing that all is God.\\" The way of Spinoza, yes. The Way of Solomon, no. For that matter, not exactly the way of Lao-tzu either.	2003-08-27

Thomas a Kempis' The Imitation of Christ is said to be the most read Christian book apart from the Bible. It is held to be one of the foremost devotional classics of the ages. While it is not difficult to see why this should be the case, I will be so bold as to offer some detraction. But first I must acknowledge what is praiseworthy in the writings of the 15th century Augustinian monk. The admonitions of Thomas generally fall into two categories: 1) to accept Christ's invitation to learn to become humble and gentle, and 2) to make sure that you do all the &quot;religious&quot; stuff (sacraments and so forth). The former consideration is a most important one for all Christians, and in fact for anyone who seeks wisdom and peace, the latter consideration is another matter...<br />In his admonitions for the Christian to turn from self-focus and to live in humility, these writings are wonderful. Thomas says, &quot;Trust neither in your own knowledge nor in the cleverness of any human being; rather, trust in God's grace, for it is He who supports the humble and humbles the overconfident.&quot; Of the importance of humility to one's ability to learn, we find observations such as this:<br />&quot;Those who think themselves wise are rarely humble enough to allow others to guide them. It is better to be a blockhead and a numskull, and to be humble about it, than to posses encyclopedic knowledge and be filled with self-conceit. Better to have little than much, if much is going to make you proud.&quot;<br />Thomas' fideistic admonitions to religious acts are less valuable. For example, he scolds monks for not getting up in the middle of the night to participate in hymn singing services and so forth. It may be helpful to here remind ourselves that, in these writings, the author is instructing young monks in the ways of being a good &quot;religious.&quot;<br />Read those portions of this book that you find to direct you toward humility and becoming more teachable, while perhaps passing over others. Those &quot;others&quot; however, may be less troublesome to some Catholics and Orthodox than they will be to most Protestants. Ritualized doings are the teachings of creeds and of the &quot;religious,&quot; they are not the teachings of Christ.over others.

There is a great deal of philosophical argument and psychological investigation in these great, rambling discourses. There is mystery, murder, intrigue, obsession, romantic entanglement, and courtroom drama. But first, of the drudgery...<br />Ya ne govoryu po russki... Alexei is Alyosha is Lyoshechka. Ivan is Vanechka. Dmitri is Mitya is Mitka is Mitenka. Agrafena Alexandrovna is Grushenka is Grusha. The elder Zosima is rather a saint. Not only because of his patience, humility, gentleness, and refusal to judge others, but because we must know him only by this one name! Perhaps it's not all that bad, by the time you are, say, 400 pages into our story (about half way through), you will have made your peace with such nuances. Some readers will be troubled by the length of sentences and of paragraphs, typically sentences may contain 6 to 12 commas, they're huge. The exclamatory devices in many dialogues seem [to this reader] to be 'over the top', so to speak, as if Dostoevsky, in his mind's eye, was seeing his story played-out on stage. Perhaps this is just my ignorant perspective.<br />Enough detraction. The Brothers Karamazov is said to be a master's masterpiece. I will not argue, in this regard, with those who know such things far better than I. Dostoevsky digs deep into the psyche of his central characters, and sometimes the peripheral characters as well. Perhaps more so than any other great novelist. Each of these characters becomes startlingly complex (in many cases we might even say schizophrenic). For example, we meet a monk known for his resolute silence, who suddenly just won't shut-up. Of the Karamazov's, Fyodor and Dmitri are pathological slaves to their self-focused passions, although in Dmitri we come to find a surprising glimmer of possibility. (If you are close to someone terribly like Fyodor, you have my sympathy). The restrained and calculating Ivan is hardheaded and hard-hearted, and to his own demise, his calculating is rather blinded by his over confidence and sense of his own intelligence. The spiritual pilgrim, Alexei -- gentle, humble, careful, encouraging, and in a sense fearless -- is the author's hero, is everyone's rock in the storm, seems burdened only by other's burdens.<br />Apart from the author's ability to plumb the depths of the human soul, this reader was surprised at the sophistication and integrity of the Russian legal and judicial processes in the 1870's. I won't disclose the story any further except to note that Dostoevsky intended to further examine his characters in subsequent volumes, but died somewhat suddenly preparing this work for publication.<br />In its philosophic and psychological aspects, this book remains insightful and relevant. Dostoevsky modestly considered himself a dabbler in philosophy. But who isn't? Philosophy is, after all, the love of thought, not the perfect mastery of it, and Dostoevsky emerges as a thinker of greater stature than he conceived himself. He is often included in the 'short list' of great moral philosophers (with Plato and Kierkegaard, for example), and of the great existentialists (with Kierkegaard and Nietzsche).<br />The central existentialist question, that is of the existence of God, is examined not only in the conversations between Ivan (a professing atheist) and his brother Alexei, but is an enigma for Ivan even in his private moments, perhaps especially in his moments of delirium. In his \\"The Grand Inquisitor,\\" Ivan argues a case against God from the existence of evil and injustice. This is the classic Enlightenment argument that there is no God because God 'wouldn't do it that way.' One problem with an argument citing evil and injustice is that it must posit a cognition of goodness and of justice. How do we explain such a cognition if there is no God? If there is no God there is nothing 'higher' to which our passions must answer, excepting perhaps the passions of others. In other words, \\"all is permitted.\\" Yet we sense that this simply isn't the case. It seems that having weighed the argument from the existence of pain and suffering, Dostoevsky holds it to be the troubled rantings of finite man shaking his fist at the Infinite. But we can only surmise this, as Dostoevsky's masterpiece simply stops...s permitted.\\" Yet we sense that this simply isn't the case.

Mind as opposed to machine...<br />Read any physics text or popularization of the past thirty-five years and you are virtually certain to encounter Arno Penzias. He received the Nobel Prize for physics by detecting the cosmic microwave background radiation that George Gamow had predicted two decades earlier. Theorists sometimes suggest that Gamow's Nobel somehow landed accidentally in Penzias' empirical lap. One imagines that Penzias might be tempted to barrow a line from Rodney Dangerfield: &quot;I tell ya, I don't get no respect.&quot; He doesn't do that.<br />Anyway, when I spotted this book in a used bookstore I happily nabbed it. The author's theme in this volume is computability -- how it works, what it is, and what it isn't. The book is highly readable and makes for a sound introduction to what computer software is, and to how artificial intelligence and human intelligence are, foundationally, two very different things. The strong AI types don't want to hear this stuff and will likely complain that Penzias' book is &quot;dated.&quot; I will say that only the author's examples/ allegories are dated. Technological gadgetry changes quite a bit in 14 years, but the examples are only examples. Programming is still programming; it is still a process of numerical reduction. It is still something far different than human intuition. With a modicum of updates, Penzias' thesis might easily read as a more current set of arguments and observations.<br />Consider this book a springboard into the work of Roger Penrose (uh-oh, you'll be mixing empirical guy and theoretical guy!).<br />Penzias says, &quot;If you don't want to be replaced by a machine, don't act like one.&quot; Machines are quite useful, but your mind is not a mere machine. Use it to its strength -- be creative, be non-linear. This empirical guy sounds a lot like a theoretical guy. Somewhere an ardent reductionist is cringing.	2003-06-11

Mitchell gives us \\"everything I try to intuit about Jesus' life,\\" and assures us that \\"scholars show a remarkable degree of consensus\\" with his intuitions. \\"I wanted to compile a gospel,\\" the authors earnestly offers, which rejects as \\"polemic\\" those New Testament references which are not properly Buddhist, and references which we are instructed that \\"scholarship\\" rejects on the \\"ground base\\" that they are not \\"authentic\\", not \\"historical.\\" Mitchell gives us Jesus the Zen master, the member of the spiritual elite, a Jesus that stands with the \\"other Masters\\" -- Spinoza, the Buddha, Lau-tzu. The operative ad hoc hypothesis here is that Christianity is mostly, as the author is fond of saying, \\"legend.\\" We do yet find, in Mitchell's tamed revision of Jesus, a most profound body of teachings. But at what cost? Humanist revisions of Jesus have been suggested for three centuries now. They are generally exercises that must be false to the most plentiful documents of pre-modern history.<br />Mitchell's cited \\"scholars\\" are, if you haven't guessed, members of the Jesus Seminar, and certainly do not reflect \\"a remarkable degree of consensus\\" with a broad sampling of New Testament scholarship. Mitchell justifies his preferred revisionist version of Jesus on the basis that Thomas Jefferson and Friedrich Nietzsche seem to have also preferred such a Jesus. The influences in Jefferson's and Nietzsche's worlds were different, but in no way less prejudicial than in the world of the early church. Nor can any conjectural club of 18th or 20th century \\"historians\\" or \\"scholars\\" examine more accurately the historicity of the Christian canon than could Matthew, Luke, Paul, John, Justin, Polycarp, Clement, Origen, Cyprian, Eusebius, Jerome, Augustine, and thousands of other witnesses, many of them martyrs for their knowledge of the man Mitchell calls a sectarian legend. Toward what end would \\"the Evangelists\\" have produced a false Christ, these men who died lonely and hard deaths for the \\"legend\\" they are said to have invented? Certainly not to conform to a convenient conjecture or a popular philosophy of socio-aesthetics. At the outset, the author magnanimously concedes that there may be something he is missing in the texts that he rejects. Perhaps they are not what he understands them to be. Many scholars who are not members of Mitchell's 'consensus' will quickly find that Mitchell is indeed missing something. He sets out to miss something. His characterizations of the references he rejects are typically heavy handed in their straw-man structuring. It is given that we are to accept the so-called Gospel of Thomas on an equal historical footing with the canonical gospels -- something Christianity has always rejected -- we are then to use it as counterpoint to the canonical gospels and to conclude that the gospels are thereby poisoned. A straw conclusion. His exegesis appeals to arbitrary authority and is typically precommitted to a personal aesthetic (as compared to the work of serious minded exegetes like Origen or Augustine).<br />In the profundity of Jesus' commandment of love, and in the intimate presence of the Kingdom of God, the author seems to think he has found the Jesus that is unknown to Christianity. It is sadly true that this has often been the case, but it is also far less than wholly truthful. I will say that many -- Augustine, Francis of Assisi, Wesley, Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, Sadhu Sundar Singh, Bonhoeffer, Teresa of Calcutta, and Desmond Tutu, for a few diverse examples -- have understood these teachings of Jesus better than does Mitchell, without needing to reinvent Jesus. In writing of these things, however, Mitchell does offer some thoughts worthy of close examination. He is correct in finding, in his pared-down Jesus, a teacher of moral philosophy that resembles Lau-tzu, and a body of teachings that resembles the Tao Te Ching. There is, of course, no historical or cultural connection, but in this resemblance we find universality to all coherent ethical codes and thereby a strong case against moral relativism, as has been pointed out by C.S. Lewis, for example. Good is Good and Truth is Truth, even if it is only part of the truth, and even if it is mixed with fabrication.<br />Thus this volume is not without some measure of merit. This cannot overcome the fact that the book presents, and yes, polemically so, a contrived and personally convenient version of history, a contrived and personally convenient version of Jesus.coherent ethical codes and thereby a strong case against moral relativism, as has been pointed out by C.S.

Even so, it makes for a reasonably good overview of a universe more than 20 billion light years wide made out of stuff so small that we must describe it using negative powers of ten. The idea here is to illustrate the dramatic changes of scale involved in only a few powers of ten, and thus the \\"power\\" of powers of ten.

The gentle benevolence of a tree is economically contrasted to the destructive self obsessions of a child. The child grows older but remains a foolish child insomuch as he is blinded by his restless selfishness. The lesson here will be obvious, or at least it should be: the ugly, insatiable desperation of self-focus as opposed to the gracious beauty of love and selflessness. Silverstein presents an important and compelling counterpoint to the me-ism, consumerism and self obsessiveness that naturally appeal to children, especially in affluent cultures, and which many children can never escape even in small measure. A tree is the perfect allegory for this lesson. If you only read a half dozen books to your child, this should be one of them. Adults would do well to contemplate this story as well. Very, very highly recommended.	2003-04-27

Let me first say something about Roger Penrose. One notices how certain other mathematicians and mathematical physicists speak of him. He is not only admired and respected; it seems that he is positively enjoyed! This may be a bit surprising when one notices that Penrose is something of a thorn in the side of several popular ideas in contemporary physics (and psychology). Cosmic inflation theories and ideas regarding the fundamental nature of quantum uncertainty find a formidable and articulate critic in the Oxford mathematician. Of the somewhat less popular, but ever fanciful \\"many-worlds\\" interpretation of quantum superpositioning, Penrose says \\"[the 'many-worlds' view] is not a very economical description of the Universe but I think things are rather worse than that for the many-worlds description. It is not just its lack of economy that worries me. The main problem is that it does not really solve the problem.\\" He brings the same mental rapier to what he has called \\"the missing science\\" of mind and to the idea of computational / artificial intelligence. It is the problem of superpositioning described by Schrodinger and the decoherence caused by quantum measurement that prompt Penrose's search for an 'objective reduction' (OR) of quantum state vectors, the key ingredient in a \\"revolutionary\\" physical theory that remains a mystery. He speculates that this physical mystery may be related to the mystery of consciousness. He is unconvincing in this regard, but his ideas and arguments are quite interesting.<br />Well, let me now take this a bit further. Penrose also seems to terribly irk certain others! In particular he really raises the hackles of proponents of strong AI and the Dawkins/Dennett camp of 'consciousness-is-merely-mechanism' dogmatists. His views are much closer to those of perhaps most mathematicians and philosophers and stand on a deeper logical footing than do the doctrines that the human mind is mere biology. Let me say that I agree with Penrose in that the 'simple biology' view is never going to win this argument for reasons that can be demonstrated by the application of mathematical logic. To say that Penrose \\"doesn't understand biology\\" is to miss the point. The author freely admits, \\"there is a good deal of speculation in many of these ideas\\". Of course there is; science is largely -- we might even say wholly -- speculation. A more perceptive analysis would suggest that those committed to a rigid materialistic aesthetic don't understand (don't want to understand) the mathematics. Those who summarily dismiss Penrose do so unwisely. Given his contributions to mathematics (e.g., Penrose tiling, computability, mathematical logic) and his stature within the mathematics community, and given that the history of mathematics is essentially written by mathematicians, Roger Penrose may come to be considered the greatest mathematician of his generation. Given his work on black holes and space-time geometry (he recognizes the apparent \\"flatness\\" of the universe but suggests a more elegant geometry to describe that flatness), he may be one of his day's greatest physicists as well. Should his hunch (\\"OR\\") one day prove \\"true\\", his stature would approach that of a Newton or Einstein. The point being that any scientist who avoids or ignores Penrose's views, or is inclined to dismiss them by erroneously characterizing them, does so, as I say, unwisely.<br />Chapters 4, 5, and 6 are challenges to Penrose from A. Shimony, N. Cartwright, and S. Hawking, respectively. Apart from Shimony's discussion of A. N. Whitehead's views, its not on a par with the author's discourses; Cartwright suggests that nature may be a mess of \\"patchwork\\" laws (her view itself seems a horrible mess), and Hawking is disappointingly flippant. Penrose certainly meets these challenges.<br />I must say that the \\"controversy\\" over Penrose's Platonism is nothing less than nonsensical. Hawking complains \\"basically, he's a Platonist,\\" as though calling him anoffensive name and thereby granting the reader cause to disregard Penrose's arguments. That's unfortunate. Most of history's great minds have been Platonists; even Aristotle*, so often cited as the philosophical godfather of reductionism, was arguably a Platonist. Augustine, Kepler, Descartes, Pascal, Newton, Leibniz, Kant, Linnaeus, Einstein*, Schr&ouml;dinger, G&ouml;del, Whitehead -- the list of Platonists is long and impressive. As Penrose has said, \\"... it is my direct personal impression that the considerable majority of working mathematicians are at least 'weak' Platonists.\\" Yet it seems as if some who call themselves \\"positivists\\" feel a calling to be science's mind-police. I suggest that this should be the real controversy... So-called positivists would do well to honesty consider G&ouml;del's observation that the idea that mind/mentality is simply material is nothing more than the \\"prejudice of our time.\\"<br />There is a rather child-like glee in the way Penrose sees and uses mathematics.

Devlin: \\"The particular topics I have chosen are all central themes within mathematics... But the fact is, I could have chosen any collection of seven or eight general areas and told the same story; That mathematics is the science of patterns, and those patterns can be found anywhere you care to look for them, in the physical universe, in the living world, or even in our own minds. And that mathematics serves us by making the invisible visible.\\"<br />At this writing it has been more than a few years since my last class in mathematics. But I liked math as a student and still do, even at the point that notation and degree of abstraction begins to hurt my head, so to speak, I still like it. There is a solidity and a beauty in mathematics that eclipses the empirical sciences. It is not only the practical applicability, logical purity, and beauty of mathematics that interest me, it is also its very immateriality. As Devlin states, \\"music exists not on the printed page, but in our minds. The same is true for mathematics; the symbols on a page are just a representation of the mathematics.\\"<br />This is a wonderful book. Before 1900, mathematics could be wholly categorized within about a dozen subjects. While advances are still being made in some of these older disciplines -- Devlin discusses how developments in number theory are being applied to encryption for such purposes as banking security -- there are now at least 60-70 somewhat distinct disciplines of mathematics. The author reveals the logical foundations, history, and current applications of number theory, mathematical logic, the calculus, relativistic geometry, topology, and probability. Applications of mathematics to such seemingly far-flung fields as linguistics, electrodynamics, and astrophysics are briefly but aptly considered. He introduces us to the patterns and progressions of perceptive minds, from the Pythagoreans, Platonists, and Peripatetics, to Pascal and Penrose, with glances at Galileo, Gauss and Godel. [Okay, enough alliteration ... just having a little fun with patterns; and patterns, as Devlin instructs, is precisely what mathematics is all about.][Okay, enough alliteration ... just having a little fun with patterns; and patterns, as Devlin instructs, is precisely what mathematics is all about.]	2003-02-25

Because his objective is to expose the limitations of Enlightenment evidentialism, Clark begins with discussions of arguments for and against natural theology, concluding that all such arguments are inconclusive and thus fail as classical \\"proofs.\\" Given both psychological differences and the stringent requirements of universal proof, none of these arguments can ever compel all rational beings to accept them. [Such arguments do often succeed as person-specific \\"proofs\\", more accurately, as sufficiently compelling inferences.] This standard -- to be universally accepted by all rational persons -- is one that extremely few propositions could ever attain. Held to this standard, one would be justified in believing nothing; he might even reject the proposition that his own mind exists (Descartes' famous argument not withstanding). The atheistic argument from the existence of evil and Plantinga's refutation of its claim of consistent logic receives more thorough attention than do the theistic arguments cited (cosmological, design, cumulative/probabilistic). The seemingly cursory treatment of the cosmological and probabilistic arguments becomes understandable in light of Clark's central argument, which emerges toward the end of chapter three. While recognizing that a professional philosopher should concern himself more with the form of an argument than with its species, it nonetheless seems that Clark misstates the probabilistic argument by citing inappropriate numbers (odds of one in one billion, one in ten billion). This is a mathematical argument and Clark's numbers are inconsistent with the actual mathematics of the argument. For example, mathematicians Hoyle and Wickramasinghe calculate the probability that an enzyme could be produced by shuffling amino acids at no better than one in 10 to the 6900th power. This level of improbability itself can only exist in a universe that is incredibly unlikely, Hawking and Beckenstein calculate a probability less than one over 10 raised to the power of 10 to the 123rd [Penrose says one over infinity]. None of this yet brings us to the odds of a living cell spontaneously appearing. Trillions of universes like ours would not be large enough to house the constituents (1, 2, 3 . . . ->) of the kind of number that would express odds like one over 10 to the 6900th, if the integrals of such a mathematical expression were be written out (the total number of particles in the universe, including the massless photons, is something like 10 to the one hundredth power, a miniscule number compared to those previously mentioned). These kinds of odds have no analogicity to odds such as a mere one in 10 billion!... None of this, of course, is what Clark intends this book to address. These mathematical (thus evidential) considerations do however carve a gaping hole in the beliefs of many 'Enlightened evidentialists.' The mathematician (information theory) Hubert Yockey notes that all college undergraduate textbooks present the primeval soup paradigm of spontaneous abiogenesis as an established fact although it cannot be evidentially supported either by biochemistry or by mathematics. Yockey says, \\"The belief that life on earth arose spontaneously from non-living matter, is simply a matter of faith in strict reductionism and is based entirely on ideology.\\" The point being that the strict evidentiary standard of the 'Enlightened' agnostic is one that he himself does not satisfy in important instances where his will to believe sweeps aside his skepticism. While Clark is not particularly interested in probabilistic arguments, he does take some note of the practical inconsistencies of popular, so-called skepticism. In the second half of the book he examines the foundational structure of Enlightenment reasoning...<br />That evidential investigation is important to scientific truth seeking cannot ameliorate this approach to all potential truths. Something is not proved false because it does not lend itself to evidential scrutiny, nor may it cease to be something that warrants rational belief. An authoritarian evidentialism may result in fear of error superceding willingness to risk truth-seeking. The interaction of minds provides relevant examples: Clark quotes C.S. Lewis; \\"There are times when we can do all that a fellow creature needs if only he will trust us. ...in extracting a thorn from a child's finger, in teaching a boy to swim or rescuing one who can't, in getting a frightened beginner over a nasty place on a mountain, the one fatal obstacle may be their distrust. We are asking them to trust us in the teeth of their senses, their imagination, and their intelligence.... We ask them to accept apparent impossibilities: ... that hurting the finger very much more will stop the finger hurting -- that the water which is obviously permeable will resist and support the body -- that holding onto the only support within reach is not the way to avoid sinking -- that to go higher and onto a more exposed ledge is the way not to fall.... If the young mountaineer were a scientist, it would not be held against him, when he came up for a fellowship, that he had once departed from Clifford's rule of evidence by entertaining a belief with strength greater than the evidence logically obliged him to.\\" Clark examines Plantinga's argument that belief in the existence of God is rationally a species of belief in the existence of other minds. As such, belief in God's existence cannot be reasonably restricted to scientific evidentialism. It may be a matter of properly basic reasoning -- this being the relevant concept in our relational knowledge of other minds. \\"No philosopher has ever constructed a good argument for the existence of other minds, and it is difficult to see how this task might be accomplished.\\" Clark examines classical foundationalism and finds that in certain areas outside of physical science, namely in the realm of relational experience with other minds -- with persons, evidentialism is often irrelevant, rationally absurd, impossible, even perverse. This is the heart of the Reformed epistemological argument -- the rationality of immediate knowledge.

The book contains three closely related essays on ethical relativism. As different as Eastern philosophy (Chinese and Indian) may be from Western philosophy (Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian), all seriously reasoned and internally consistent systems of ethics (i.e., morality) accept the true existence of an absolute Good. In The Abolition of Man, C.S. Lewis, a thinker deeply versed in philosophy, philology, and ancient literature, calls this universal ethical reference system 'the Tao' (borrowing a generalization from Confucius). He exposes the logical self-contradictions and the human negation of modern dogmas of moral relativism.<br />From 'Men without Chests': \\"The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts. The right defense against false sentiments is to inculcate just sentiments. By starving the sensibility of [students] we only make them easier prey to the propagandist ... a hard heart is no infallible protection against a soft head.\\"<br />From 'The Way': \\"An open mind, in questions that are not ultimate, is useful. But an open mind about the ultimate foundations either of Theoretical or of Practical Reason is idiocy. If a man's mind is open on these things, let his mouth at least be shut.\\"<br />From 'The Abolition of Man': \\"It is not that [propagandists of ethical relativism] are bad men. They are not men at all. Stepping outside of the Tao, they have stepped into the void. Nor are their subjects necessarily unhappy men. They are not men at all: they are artifacts. Man's final conquest has proven to be the abolition of Man.\\"<br />We accept relativism in modern physics because reason has led us to it. But popularized ideas of relativism in ethics, while sometimes transparently parading as 'intellectualism' (this label attempts to discourage critical examination), must take a course which leads far from consistent logic, and which ultimately turns against itself. This book is an outstanding offering from the wonderful mind of C.S. Lewis.wis.	2003-01-22

Lewis' works, insofar as I have read them, are philosophically and theologically well considered. Of course, that is an understatement. He shies away from no serious question or &quot;problem&quot;. He was the most important apologist of the twentieth century.<br />The Joyful Christian is a collection of 127 readings drawn from his extensive body of work, varying in length from a few sentences to several pages. This reader found only a few discussions in which (I believe) Lewis errs. Most of this collection is very sound (again an understatement). At the same time I was reading this volume, I was reading the thoughts of another well-known 20th century theologian, who was in search of the &quot;historical Jesus.&quot; Lewis' thoughts on the subject were much closer to being correct: &quot;In the last generation we promoted the construction of such a 'historical Jesus' on liberal and humanitarian lines; we are now putting forward a new 'historical Jesus' on Marxian, catastrophic, and revolutionary lines. The advantages of these constructions, which we intend to change every thirty years or so, are manifold. ...for each 'historical Jesus' is unhistorical. The documents say what they say ...each new 'historical Jesus' therefore has to be got out of them by suppression at one point and exaggeration at another ...religion of this kind is false to history...&quot;<br />Lewis on 'Prudence': &quot;Christ said we could only get into His world by being like children... as St. Paul points out, Christ never meant that we were to remain children in intelligence: on the contrary, He told us to be not only 'as harmless as doves' but also 'as wise as serpents.' He wants a child's heart, but a grown-up's head. He wants us to be simple, single-minded, affectionate, and teachable, as good children are; but he also wants every bit of intelligence we have to be alert at its job... He wants everyone to use what sense they have.&quot;<br />Lewis on 'Hope': &quot;The Apostles themselves, who set on foot the conversion of the Roman Empire, the great men who built up the Middle Ages, the English Evangelicals who abolished the Slave Trade, all left their mark on Earth, precisely because their minds were occupied with Heaven. It is since Christians have largely ceased to think of the other world that they have become so ineffective in this. Aim at Heaven and you will get Earth 'thrown in': aim at Earth and you will get neither.&quot;<br />Lewis on 'Apologetics': &quot;The great difficulty is to get modern audiences to realize that you are preaching Christianity solely and simply because you happen to think it is true; they always suppose you are preaching it because you like it or think it good for society or something of that sort...&quot;<br />'The Joyful Christian' is one of the best collections of theological thought and Christian apologetics you are likely to find.set on foot the conversion of the Roman Empire, the great men who built up the Middle Ages, the English Evangelicals who abolished the Slave Trade, all left their mark on Earth, precisely because their minds were occupied with Heaven.

The world described by the greatest of scientists, Isaac Newton, changed quickly to a very strange and startling world described notably by Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Pauli, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Dirac, Fermi, and a few others. George Gamow was one of these individuals. His lucent knowledge of the important ideas of the quantum theories and of the men who developed these ideas, makes for very interesting reading.<br />In his &quot;Thirty Years that Shook Physics,&quot; Gamow the physicist is also found to be Gamow the artist -- his excellent drawings augment the narrative -- and Gamow the light hearted humorist. Because of the author's close friendships with Bohr and Pauli (and to a lesser extent, Dirac) the reader will meet not only the thoughts of these characters, but the characters themselves. It seems that quantum physicists like to have fun too. The book concludes with an illustrated text of a play composed and performed at the 1932 Copenhagen conference, although it can be followed it is something of an 'inside joke', if you will.<br />The book was written in 1965 and Gamow, noting difficulties with quantum theory, expected to see a new and equally radical revolution in physical theories before the end of the century. Although quantum theory has been hugely successful in its application, a new theory is still anticipated. [M-theory?] This book is an excellent account of the emergence of quantum theory, presented in the words of one of its principals.	2003-01-22

He writes an interesting autobiography, which is not surprising when one considers the breadth of his interests and of his achievements in science, the humanities and the arts. In his later years he was perhaps the most widely admired and respected person in the Western world.<br />Jimmy Carter offers a foreword in this volume; it is economical, a mere six sentences. Schweitzer's philosophical work may be well studied, but does not particularly distinguish itself in this volume (with some notable exceptions). His theological work (i.e., Christology) is generally questionable -- bound to Enlightenment fallacies of a \\"historical Jesus.\\" I was happy to be concurrently reading the thoughts of a far better theologian, CS Lewis, on the idea of \\"discovering\\" a \\"historical\\" Jesus. While some of Schweitzer's ideas are [rightly] not highly regarded, his \\"life and thought\\" makes for unusually interesting biography. His \\"reverence for life\\" precept certainly has great value, but seems to be a less profoundly unique idea than he held it to be. Perhaps my view here is merely ignorant of the world in which Schweitzer lived.<br />He considered this book to be his best, or at least his preferred, writing, but if you are going to read only one book considering theological and historical exegetics, this is probably the wrong book.

It is superficial and inflexible.\\" Kant had observed the intellectual paralysis of such \\"a skepticism that has become belief,\\" but Schweitzer goes further, recognizing it as an even deeper spiritual paralysis.<br />While Schweitzer's Christology is, at the least, arguable, his firm commitment to Christ's commandment of love is a strong example of the Christian life led in the light of its Teacher's example. The author is [rightly] given to referring to Christianity as \\"the religion of love.\\" In this aspect, Schweitzer at once offers the non-Christian a true image of Christianity and offers the Christian an important, if gentle, reminder. \\"[God] announces Himself in us as the will to love.

Thomas' thought is among the densest of all philosophers', and is, for the modern student, perhaps more difficult to grasp than is the work of Kant. A reader unfamiliar with philosophy should not initiate his study with Thomas. For the student [at least] somewhat grounded in existentialist reasoning, this compilation serves as a concise introduction to Thomist metaphysics/ natural theology/ first philosophy.

How is it that most grasses are not killed by flooding when even a brief period of waterlogged soil will kill many other plants? Why does snow melt near flowering crocuses? What is the 'carbon cycle'? The 'nitrogen cycle'? Is the incredibly complex system known as photosynthesis really fundamental to virtually all life on this planet? Professor King offers and then answers (to the best of our present knowledge) these rather obvious questions as well as others that we may not have thought to ask.<br />For this reader, the first six chapters were the most fascinating. Of photosynthesis, King says; \\"There are lots of carbon dioxide and water molecules in the air, oceans, lakes, the soil, and inside living organisms, but the chances of any of them simply coming together in the right way to produce even a single molecule of glucose are extremely remote.... is not likely to have happened in the billions of years carbon dioxide and water have existed ... Yet, green plants form glucose from carbon dioxide and water every daylight hour during their growing seasons. Having accomplished that impressive feat, plants then go on to produce a seemingly endless supply of sucrose, starch, and cellulose from the glucose.\\" And of plant's partnerships with nitrogen fixing microbes: \\"It is, arguably, not to strong to call this process miraculous. The nitrogen fixation carried out by certain microbes at normal temperatures and pressures in and around plant roots we can match only through the use of enormous amounts of energy in the industrial Haber process; temperatures of 300-400°C and pressures greater than 350 atmospheres.\\" Indeed, the botanical world is one of incredibly complex biochemical machinery! Machinery on which we all directly depend.<br />The chapters that follow examine the chemical strategies by which plants survive and reproduce. Where the text speculates about evolutionary pathways, we see, as is typical of such texts (and as Behe, Lovtrup, Yockey, Spetner and others have pointed out), that what is basically assumed to explain 'development' on large scales, \\"is not so clear\\" at the biochemical level, and as King concedes, \\"is not known,\\" and \\"remains a mystery.\\" What might be the origin of such complex biochemical machinery, if, as King says, \\"organisms do not put energy and materials into processes that have no function.\\"? It's difficult to see how Darwinian gradualism could design such complexity (unless we are simply predisposed to believe that it did). While King occasionally visits Darwin and these biochemical problems, this volume generally pursues other considerations. The human histories of plants -- in terms of perfumes, the spice trade, agriculture, poisons, intoxicants, and medicines -- are extensively considered in the later chapters.<br />The books greater strength, however, is its revelation of \\"how plants work.\\" If plants interest you (and they should), then you are the reader that Professor King wishes to educate with this volume.

This view runs contrary to the realist and so-called neo-Platonist view preferred by many mathematicians and physicists (Godel, Schrodinger, Einstein, and Hawking's friend Roger Penrose, for example), who are no less committed to material reductionism as methodology, but who assert that metaphysical considerations play into a true reality. In the realist's view, reality exists, whether reductionistic science can unveil it or not. What is most curious in this volume is that Hawking, the positivist, argues for a cosmological model whose foundations, he concedes, are \\"metaphysical\\". Confused? At this point perhaps you should be. Fortunately, Hawking is generally not philosophically dogmatic. In fact, the good professor generally likes to hedge his bets, especially when it comes to the \\"big\\" questions.<br />Its seems to Hawking that we have but two potential explanations for the fine-tuning of the universe: a) God's omniscience and will; or b) the so-called weak anthropic principle. The anthropic principles are \\"explanations\\" generally seen as logically lacking explanatory power, but the author looks for a means of making the weak principle seem less, well, goofy. With his \\"no boundaries\\" proposal, Hawking aspires to find alternatives to an omniscient Law-giver/designer, if in fact, such alternatives can be found (the operative a priori aesthetic generally being that they must be found, and so we again dance with metaphysics). The \\"no boundaries\\" proposal ultimately appeals to the weak anthropic principle, that's the WAP, not the SAP or the FAP (it is easily argued that all are CR__). The anthropic principles are an awkward assemblage of a posteriori musings, each in its own way tautologically stating that things are as we observe them because this is the way things are. In Hawking's words, the appeal to imaginary time and to the WAP is \\"put forward for aesthetic or metaphysical reasons.\\" Its truth or falsity \\"cannot be deduced\\" and \\"exists only in our minds.\\" So much for any denial of metaphysics! Hawking's exploratory 'alternative' to a creator is not much of an alternative (the \\"just because\\", dumb-luck WAP). The principle of economy (Ockham's Razor) favors God. Hugely. Although it is often mentioned, Hawking's \\"no boundaries\\" inflationary theory has not won many converts among physicists. It's difficult to find much room for science in it. Theidea that the universe is physically 'self-contained' is hardly a radical idea, and the \\"why\\" questions persist in all models, including inflationary ones. Something more like Guth's inflationary model is generally favored (in part perhaps, because it avoids such pretensions as inventing its own metaphysic). Although he suggests that it can, Hawking's proposal certainly doesn't get rid of God, in fact Hawking demonstrates a fundamental ignorance of theology (see Polkinghorne). Among the book's flaws: the author waves the magic wand of \\"macromolecules\\" as he whistles past the graveyard of abiogenesis theories. Among the book's more interesting investigations: black holes, ideas of wormholes in space-time, and the practical difficulties of time travel. In the end we are always led to the question, 'what does it all mean?' Hawking concludes with statements that are poetically lofty but philosophically dubious, at best arguable, and certainly metaphysical. Nonetheless, it's a book read by almost everyone interested in science, cited often by other physicists (even if mainly as a curiosity), and well worth the couple of evenings it will take to read. \\"A lot of prizes have been awarded for showing that the universe is not as simple as we might have thought,\\" says Hawking.

In late 1942, theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, \\"... the power of some needs the folly of others. It is not that [intellectual capacities] become stunted or destroyed, but rather that the upsurge of power makes such an overwhelming impression that men are deprived of their independent judgment, and -- more or less unconsciously -- give up trying to assess the new state of affairs for themselves. The fact that the fool is often stubborn must not mislead us into thinking that he is independent. One feels in fact, when talking to him, that one is dealing, not with the man himself, but with slogans, catchwords, and the like, which have taken hold of him. ... folly can be overcome, not by instruction, but only by an act of liberation... a person's inward liberation to live a responsible life before God is the only real cure for folly.\\"<br />Folly and Bonhoeffer were on a collision course.<br />During his long imprisonment by the Nazi regime, Bonhoeffer corresponded with members of his family. Many of these letters were collected, and later published, by Eberhard Bethge, Bonhoeffer's niece's husband. The letters between Bonhoeffer and Bethge, his intellectual and spiritual confidant, are the most insightful in terms of revealing the intellectual Bonhoeffer. Although his life hangs in the balance, Bonhoeffer only occasionally speaks of his own welfare, and then apologetically and only in passing. With Bethge, and to a lesser extent with his father and others, he prefers directing his thoughts to a great breadth of interests -- art, history, music, philosophy, physics, psychology, sociology, theology. With all correspondents, Bonhoeffer expresses constant concern for their welfare, as well as for the welfare of his fellow prisoners and even his Nazi guards. We continually have statements like this one:<br />\\"I wish you much joy and don't want you to be disturbed by any thoughts about me. I have every reason to be so infinitely grateful about everything. ... the prisoners and guards here keep saying how they are 'amazed' (?!) at my tranquillity and cheerfulness. I myself am always amazed about remarks of this kind. But isn't it rather nice?\\"<br />To 'flesh-out' the context for Bonhoeffer's letters, Bethge has included much of the letter writing of his correspondents, and you may choose not to read all of this material. The reader should quickly notice that the language of the letters is, in some passages, less than frank, as in Bonhoeffer's seemingly exaggerated statements of patriotism. One must remember his position, and that of his family. Bonhoeffer speaks of a desire to be able to speak freely one day, to converse face to face. To serve as a pastor, to counsel others, to be a husband to his fiancee, to support and care for his family, to study and write.<br />The Nazis, sadly, had a different agenda.uards here keep saying how they are 'amazed' (?!) at my tranquillity and cheerfulness.

More than six centuries of Greco-Roman intellection culminate in a carefully reasoned monotheism. \\"Anything existing after The First must necessarily arise from that First, whether immediately or as tracing back to it,\\" says Plotinus, 'the last great philosopher of antiquity' and, by some accounts, the first of the \\"neo-Platonists\\" (although this has been said of earlier philosophers as well). Drawing on the philosophy of Plato, Aristotle, Zeno, and indeed centuries of Hellenistic argument, Plotinus (AD204-270), presents an epistemology and mysticism that has obvious and fundamental similarities to Judeo-Christian theology. Plotinus offers a single but essentially triune deity, One God in three related but separate roles. Interestingly similar to Trinitarian theology, but there are huge differences in Plotinus' theology and that of Christianity. Recall that in Plotinus' day, Christianity was viewed as an indefatigable social pariah, an anti-establishment cult. For Plotinus, man was reconciled with the divine by means of diligent intellection, discernment, and imitation of the Absolute and immaterial consciousness (God). In other words, man may reconcile himself with God by virtue of his own will and effort. Here is an idea not uncommon to theism, we find it in Gnosticism, Islam, and Hinduism, for example. By contrast, in Christian doctrine, reconciliation is a divine gift which man can accept, but could never earn by virtue of his own intrinsic merit and/or efforts. Yet Plotinus approaches more closely to a Christian understanding of ethics and knowledge than he himself might have known, stating that if the aspiration towards logic and virtue \\"which is in our nature exists also in this Ruling-Power, then we need not look elsewhere for the source of order and of the virtues in ourselves.\\"<br />MacKenna's slightly pared-down translation of the Enneads [Penguin Classics] is a collection of six sets of treatises compiled by Porphyry, a student and confidant of Plotinus. Although they are not presented in the order in which Plotinus produced them (and a few are omitted here), the tractates embody Plotinus' system, which he held to be an advancement of Plato's system and one wholly superior to Aristotle's.<br />Plotinus' theology seems inadequate when compared to that of Augustine a century and a half later. But his logic is interesting -- Augustine cited him often -- and his understanding of the primacy of \\"the One\\" is something that readers will recognize as resembling the theology of monotheism:<br />\\"This Highest cannot be divided and allotted, must remain intangible but not bound to space, it may be present at many points, wheresoever there is anything capable of accepting one of its manifestations. ... It is precisely because there is nothing within the One that all things are from it: ... Seeking nothing ... lacking nothing, the One is perfect ... and in its exuberance has produced the new; this product has turned again to its begetter and been filled and has become its contemplator...\\"hough they are not presented in the order in which Plotinus produced them (and a few are omitted here), the tractates embody Plotinus' system, which he held to be an advancement of Plato's system and one wholly superior to Aristotle's.

Norris attempts to terrestrialize the otherworldly idioms of Christian faith. She offers about 80 tractates approaching words and ideas such as eschatology and forbearance. Some of her offerings assume there is a coherent nugget of truth beneath the symbols of language and succeed in exposing it. Many offerings struggle unsuccessfully with labels: fundamentalist, mainstream, hard-core, conservative, liberal, feminist theology. Perhaps this would be difficult to avoid. Many offerings simply fail to do anything other than express the author's feelings. (For some readers this may be OK).<br />The discussion of \\"salvation\\" is rather original and quite valuable. The discussion of \\"`organized' religion\\" is excellent, containing truths too deep to be recognized by the \\"sophomoric\\" and self-congratulatory dogmatisms of Enlightenment. The discussion of \\"idolatry\\" is one of the books best. The consideration of \\"feminist theology\\" is uncharacteristically protracted as compared to themes like \\"God\\" and \\"grace\\", and contains very little that Isaiah, Philo, Paul, Augustine, Wesley, or Kierkegaard would accept as being any kind of theology. Seeking to constrain God -- the Absolute -- within anthropocentric ideas of gender is merely another dance with idolatry. Norris succumbs to a popular misappropriation of the word `theology' -- perhaps we are to accept this as poetic license(?), perhaps the loftiness of the terminology is a device to lend importance to the discussion(?). The Uncaused is neither Venusian nor Martian and one must invent her (or his) own \\"theology\\" to attain any congruence here. (The issue of religious groups having treated women unfairly is one of socio-anthropology, not theology. Granted, `feminist religionism' does not have the poetic quality of `feminist theology.' )<br />Norris' consideration of the Virgin Mary is one of the books worst. She wishes to reject either/or rationality and lays claim to a \\"both/and\\" view of Mary, but the result is neither/nor. Encased in Catholic doctrine is a veneration of Mary that to Protestant doctrine is idolatrous and blasphemous. The two views are mutually exclusive. And this is not the only discordance that centers on Mary. To bridge the gap between Christian belief in Mary's divine conception and agnostic/skeptical disdain for Mary's virginity, Norris develops an alternate definition of virginity. Her definition is interesting, even valuable, but we wonder what the reader is supposed to think/believe about the issues that Norris skirts. A \\"both/and\\" Mary might `feel' nice but is an illusion. In a scene from Fiddler on the Roof, Tevye listens to one arguer and says, \\"you're right\\" only to moments later say to the man arguing the opposite, \\"you also are right.\\"  Someone protests that they cannot both be right. Tevye agrees, \\"you also are right.\\" It doesn't work, even if it \\"delights my poetic soul\\" (and still makes me laugh).<br />I wish this review didn't have to be quite so negative. Perhaps my critique is too harsh; I tend to consider books very analytically. Kathleen Norris is a seeker, which is wonderful. Her openness and sincerity cannot be overlooked; however, if half of the discussions were omitted the book would be stronger. As it is, I hesitate to recommend it. The Norris with whom I find agreement is too mixed up with the Norris who is groping and distracted. This volume is conceived of a very good idea and may be of value to readers curious about the mysteries of Christian-speak, however I would caution them that it has many weaknesses.in Catholic doctrine is a veneration of Mary that to Protestant doctrine is idolatrous and blasphemous.

Patricia O'Conner's Words Fail Me presents so many practical insights into effective writing that I suspect it would be valuable to almost any writer. And there's a bonus: she has a great sense of humor. She debunks the faux pas fallacies that snobbishly tell us how not to write -- don't use contractions, don't start sentences with conjunctions, etc. And she tells us how these supposed `rules' came to be. Wisely, O'Conner's most important rule is this:<br />&quot;Your first duty to the reader is to make sense. Everything else -- eloquence, beautiful images, catchy phrases, melodic and rhythmic language -- comes later, if at all. I'm all for artistry, but it's better to write something homely and clear than something lovely and unintelligible.&quot;<br />I read quite a lot, mostly nonfiction (philosophy, reference, science, theology, and wilderness travel). Inevitably, reading compels me to write -- I've submitted more than fifty book reviews to this forum. Yet I'm never quite happy with my writing. This is not unusual. &quot;Your favorite novel or history or memoir is just someone's last revision,&quot; says O'Conner.<br />As a student I disliked studying the nuts and bolts of English. Words, their accuracy, economy, and artistry, interest me far more now, and this book is the first &quot;how to write&quot; text I have read. At the risk of belaboring the obvious (because good writing doesn't): it was a good choice.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-10-25
US	52443550	RP8DW2PFCQ0FD	046087411X	890022491	Discourse on Method (Everyman)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Descartes: "What can be known?"	Can anything be known to be certain? This is a more difficult question than most people might recognize. Rene Descartes says yes and presents us with one of the most elegant thought experiments in the history of philosophy. We begin by calling into doubt all claims of \\"knowledge\\"; believing nothing that cannot be affirmed with absolute certainty:<br />Imagine now that an all-powerful, all-knowing being might exist external to that which we can experience with our senses, i.e., external to the material world (recall that we can neither know this nor know otherwise). Imagine further that this extra-material entity may be a devious trickster, messing with my mind, perhaps to amuse a twisted sense of humor. Because the possible trickster would exist external to the access of scientific scrutiny, I could, in my state of absolute skepticism, never know whether this sadistic consciousness is at work, not only in the material world, not only in my conscious perception of the material world, but in fact in the perceptions of all other conscious beings as well (if they actually exist, that is). Thus all scientific proofs might be mere illusion and there could be no means of determining this. In other words, if all material objects and all subjects of thought are inherently uncertain, and this is indeed a logical conclusion at this point in our consideration, what then could be known with certainty? Is then the only absolute certainty this universal and impenetrable uncertainty? Could it ever be truly known that anything exists apart from the possibility of the trickster? Only one thing: that [without regard to whether or not it is being deceived] the mind of the thinker must exist, for otherwise there is not even the illusion that our consideration is happening. Thus the only thing that I may know beyond any doubt is that my mind does exist. Cogito ergo sum, i.e., \\"I think, therefore I am.\\" This singular certainty is not without further implications. For while we have established that consciousness (i.e., mind) is more certain to exist than is matter, we don't know why this should be true. Or do we? Descartes says that there is a reason we must reach this conclusion and presents his ontological argument for the existence of a perfect and beneficent Mind beyond material constraints and uncertainty (that mind being God).<br />Whether or not Descartes believed he had \\"proved\\" the existence of God is not a very interesting point (apparently he thought so). As Pascal pointed out, such proof -- or disproof -- is not possible within the inherent limits of human investigations (Pascal found nature and reason to powerfully infer God's existence in a probabilistic sense, while \\"scientific\\" proofs must be uncertain, uncertainty being the nature of corporeal existence). What Descartes did \\"prove\\" is that the idea of an extra-cosmic mind is a rational conclusion (and is rational to a greater extent than any phenomenological observation that we might assume to be \\"true\\"). Some claim to rebut Descartes' ontology citing his geometric analogy, which was based in the 'Cartesian' paradigm which he defined. This is no great difficulty however, another mathematical illustration might have been developed had Descartes knowledge of 21st century mathematics. In fact, Descartes asserts that his conclusion does not rest on his understanding of geometry (which was about to be overtaken by Newton's mathematics). He believes that he could provide \\"an infinity\\" of allegories to illustrate his ontology. Here we find an expression of how Descartes' struggle with vanity leads to some hasty proffers (finite beings cannot wholly examine an infinity, even if we accept the existence of such). Many other thinkers, who agreed with some of Descartes arguments, quickly took umbrage with his more disputable statements. Descartes then rebutted these rebuttals. In fact some of these arguments continue today. Such is Descartes' importance to [some say \\"modern\\"] philosophy.<br />There are still other interesting aspects to these essays: Descartes' method (which is sound), his interest in medicine, physiology, neurology, his anticipation and analysis of \\"artificial intelligence\\" (three centuries before science fiction writers 'invented' the idea). Also interesting is the author's plea to the public (the work is clearly addressed to a general readership and not to his nemesis, the Jesuits, as some reviewers mistakenly suggest). Noticeably struggling to maintain his humility, the brilliant Descartes asks to be left to his work in physics. Rather than taking precious time to explain and defend his theories, he wishes to be left alone to focus on his work, asking to be judged and explained by it after his death.l other interesting aspects to these essays: Descartes' method (which is sound), his interest in medicine, physiology, neurology, his anticipation and analysis of \\"artificial intelligence\\" (three centuries before science fiction writers 'invented' the idea).

Two things brought my attention to this book. 1) Edward Hoagland's introductions in well known works of Thoreau and Muir, and 2) my interest in the beautiful expanse of wildness that is British Columbia. The book might be described as \\"quirky,\\" and I have to wonder whether it was an influence in the creation of the early nineties television series \\"Northern Exposure\\" (one of the few TV programs I have ever cared for). Published in 1969, it is the account of a New York* novelist become journalist in the great, wild watersheds of the Stikine and Skeena River systems, waters coursing from the Cassiar Mountains, \\"from sources known only from aerial photographs, some of them where nobody alive had ever been.\\"<br />*By the time the footloose essayist Hoagland recorder these images in the summer of 1966, he was already quite widely traveled, and had lived briefly in Hazelton, BC in 1960.<br />Hoagland renders \\"portraits\\" of trappers, merchants, guides, clerics, bush pilots, prospectors, \\"discoverers\\", and of the waters and forests that are their homes. He himself often fades from the text, reemerging as a curious anomaly in a world unfamiliar and unusual. In northwest BC, a wilderness \\"the size of several Ohios\\" in which the majority of residents are caribou, moose, grizzlies, marmots, wolves, beaver, otter, and lynx, each of the perhaps 1000 human residents, whether Indian or white, might be considered an anomaly. The author gravitates to the old-timers, asking \\"a dabbler's questions that to me are fun.\\"<br />This volume is not for every reader. It is very unlike the wilderness travel accounts of Thoreau or Muir (who investigated closely a landscape's flora and geology). Hoagland's attentions here are mostly directed to the local \\"characters\\" and to the nuances of the human history of a great wilderness: \\"... airplanes have made mapping easier than naming nowadays. ... The surveyors of forty years ago did a much better job because they were actually on the spot. Being men of good intentions, they were glad to incorporate Indian names on their maps when they knew them.\\" However, \\"it's an exceedingly accidental process ... if no Indian accompanied the mapper, or if he wasn't unusually expressive, all the native names slipped through the sieve and were lost right then and there.\\"<br />The author admits, \\"I'm no outdoorsman, really,\\" but he is taken with the beauty of northern BC: \\"Swaying and bucking as on a life raft, we scraped over a further series of ridges and peaks. This was the highest flying we had done; we were way up with the snow so that the cabin was cold. But the sunlight washed the whole sky a milky blue. Everywhere, into the haze a hundred miles off, a crescendo of up-pointing mountains shivered and shook. A cliff fell away beneath us as we crossed the lip. ... There was no chance to watch for game; the plunging land was life enough. It was a whole earth of mountains, beyond counting or guessing at, colored stark white and rock-brown. To live is to see, and although I was sweating against my stomach, I was irradiated. These were some of the finest minutes of my life.\\"<br />Unlike most books of wilderness travel, this is not a record of the author as a man in the wilderness. It is a series of portraits of the true men and women (mostly men) of the wilderness.

He says that he will &quot;leave the more ridiculous of my statements for the next two lectures.&quot; He's right again, but it's interesting stuff. (Actually, he makes most of his &quot;more ridiculous&quot; statements in the second lecture).<br />The &quot;meaning of it all&quot;? As the eminent citizen-scientist states again and again, &quot;I don't know.&quot; For Feynman this is cause for excitement. He finds ignorance to be the fuel of the scientist's imagination, and thus a wonderful thing. I recall Pascal's observation that &quot;it is a wise ignorance which knows itself&quot; and that in knowledge of one's ignorance it becomes apparent that &quot;it is not certain that everything is uncertain.&quot; Feynman agrees but is clearly enamored with uncertainty; he finds precision in the sciences to be both highly desirable (he says &quot;fun&quot;) and ultimately impossible (as did Pascal).<br />This small collection of transcribed lectures addresses the areas where the ideas of science overlap the ideas of philosophy, religion, and politics. As Feynman admits at the outset, he's out of his depth here. He's right. He describes agnosticism (uncertainty) and mislabels it &quot;atheism&quot; (both theism and atheism make truth claims -- that God does or does not exist -- and thus both claim a certainty); and he suggests that &quot;Arab&quot; is a religion. His differentiation between &quot;ordinary&quot; religion and &quot;the elegant theology that belongs to it&quot; is not unusual. His perception of religion as having three fundamental aspects -- metaphysical, ethical, and inspirational -- is fairly insightful. His suggestion that science has factually undermined the metaphysical aspect is simplistic and fraught with internal contradictions that Feynman seems to barely notice. Here he struggles to retain his uncertainty. The refrain that religion has no place for doubt presupposes what is, and what is not, acceptable to doubt.

I confess up front, it's been a few years since I read Muir's Travels in Alaska. Yet significant aspects I remember well. Given Muir's exuberance for life and almost everything he encounters in his travels, one almost looses view of Muir the botanist and geologist. But not quite. Here we find the author contemplating the activity of glaciers and documenting the flora of southeast Alaska. Muir (who tended strongly toward vegetarianism) gleefully entertaining himself by foiling duck hunters. Baffling the locals by happily wandering out into major storms.<br />The book is a journal of Muir's 1879, 1880, and 1890 trips (he wouldn't mind if we called them adventures) to SE Alaska's glaciers, rivers, and temperate rain forests. He died while preparing this volume for publication.<br />I remind myself, and anyone reading this, that Muir isn't for every reader. And, as other reviewers have stated, this may not be the volume in which to introduce oneself to the one-of-a-kind John Muir. One reviewer doesn't think that Muir is entirely credible in these accounts. I won't say whether or not this is wrong, but I tend to a different view. For some of us -- and certainly for Muir -- wilderness is a medicine, a spiritual tonic, so to speak. For the individual effected in this way, physical impediments and frailties rather dissolve away when he is alone in wildness. I once heard Graham Mackintosh (author of Into a Desert Place) speak of this. In all of his travels alone in the desert, he doesn't recall having ever been sick. This may not sound credible to some, but I strongly suspect it is true.<br />If you like Muir's writings, read this book. If you like the stuff of Best Sellers, perhaps you should look elsewhere.	2002-09-25

In educating scientists for the work of \\"normal science\\" it is apparent that the solubility of problems within the received structures of thought must be the centerpiece of that education. In other words, 'this is the kind of problem that is important, this is how to resolve the problem, this is what that resolution should look like.' Throughout the course of their education and subsequent work, many scientists may give little or no thought to what this means or to where it leads. This is not generally problematic, as the work of normal science is that of fine-tuning specialized niches, and a larger perspective may not be helpful. As a young physicist finishing his doctorate at Harvard, Kuhn was less interested in embracing the norm than in analyzing its structure. Kuhn's interest in these received structures of thought (to which he affixes the label \\"paradigms\\"), in their histories, psychologies, products, and limits, resulted in this classic analysis of how the natural sciences work. Many believe that this is the finest analysis ever produced examining the necessary advantages of these structures and how and why paradigms of scientific thought inevitably become intractable and inadequate.<br />As a philosopher and historian of science, Kuhn's perspective encompasses most of the historically great ideas of the natural sciences, from the astronomy of Ptolemy (one of science's earliest universal paradigms) to the problems of vibrating strings (interesting in that this was published in 1962). As a result, the book is broad in scope and extremely well supported. In it's examination of the history and philosophy of natural science and the psychology and methodology of the scientific community, this is one of those few books which is rightly called important.<br />Individuals who hold to a simplistic perspective as to what science is may take offense with aspects of Kuhn's thesis, but they need not, this volume is certainly not \\"anti-science\\". While the work of science inevitably leads to the modification or replacement of paradigms, these changes are generally of a pragmatic nature, i.e., we do not know that they resemble truth more closely, only that they seem to 'work' better. In the end we are left with important questions that may not be answerable through the work of science: \\"what must the world be like in order that man may know it?\\" Such problems are philosophical in nature and do not malign or censor the work of science, a work in progress to which this book brings an enlarged perspective. Kuhn's points are made economically but please don't rush to oversimplify them (as some obviously have), there is significant subtlety here as well.<br />Highly recommended.tably leads to the modification or replacement of paradigms, these changes are generally of a pragmatic nature, i.e., we do not know that they resemble truth more closely, only that they seem to 'work' better.

Barrow, of anthropic cosmological principle fame, undertakes to examine the logical, practical, and psychological limits to human [scientific] knowledge. The result is a sometimes interesting, but more often disappointing exposition in the history of science and of philosophy. In a volume that is essentially a philosophical treatise, we find that even Cambridge mathematicians can expound rather sloppy logic, actually evidencing the limits imposed on human investigations by human psychological encumbrances (one of the author's themes). The author's first chapter consideration of visual and linguistic paradoxes features a feeble apologia for agnosticism, which employs a linguistic paradox as an argument against the existence of an omniscient being. Barrow, who seems to be fairly well studied in philosophy, should know that Augustine decisively trashed this type of argument 1600 years ago for reasons that seem apparent in Barrow's own choice of language. [Barrow's cited paradox attests merely that no finite being can know everything. Further, a variation of the paradox attests that no one could ever know that an omniscient being does not exist.] In the second chapter, discussing the limits of the human mind revealed by Immanuel Kant, Barrow states that we understand these problems \\"as Kant did not\\" to be explained by natural selection. Natural selection is, of course, a tautological proposition (stating that if gene a is more likely to succeed than gene b, then gene a is more likely to succeed than gene b). As Kant explained, and as any student of logic knows, a tautology explains nothing. Given Barrow's skeptical consideration of various other attempts at explanation, his non-analytical and repetitive alighting on this sacrosanct tautology is unfortunate. Barrow's opening fusillades here may be his weakest, but it doesn't get a great deal better. There are some discussions that I did enjoy: the author's consideration of selective as opposed to absolute limits; and his [re]visitation of a few of the fundamental 'coincidences' contributing to the anthropic principle (chapter 5).<br />Barrow's consideration of the human mind (\\"What are minds for?\\", chapter 4) is essentially useless. His conclusions (chapters 8 and 9) are interesting but don't warrant reading the entire book to reach them: \\"If this book has taught the reader anything, I hope that the notion of impossibility is far subtler than naïve assumptions ... would lead you to believe.\\"<br />Likely, this is one of John Barrow's weakest efforts. To the reader interested in the interplay of physics and philosophy I recommend Paul Davies' The Mind of God. For the reader who is interested in logic, this book may suffice as a brief introduction to the idea of limit and to G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorem. Reading Immanuel Kant, one of the most finely disciplined minds in analytic history, would be of greater value, as would be a good epistemology text.

Pascal, the brilliant mathematician, physicist, and engineer, presents in his posthumously titled Pensees, his philosophy of religion and a paradox rich and challenging defense of Christian faith. Says Pascal, \\"Knowledge has two extremes which meet; one is the pure natural ignorance of every man at birth, the other is the extreme reached by great minds who run through the whole range of human knowledge, only to find that they know nothing... but it is a wise ignorance which knows itself. Those who stand half-way... pretend to understand everything... they get everything wrong.\\"<br />The book is a collection of unfinished writings; arguments and ideas which he had scribbled, intending to then develop and elaborate. As such, the text is disjointed and even mysterious; statements are abrupt, incomplete, dogmatic. Yet, out of respect for the intellectual accomplishments of the great French mathematician, these notes were published essentially as he had left them. They contain many gems; profound statements which stand like islands in a sea of sometimes jumbled thoughts.<br />Pascal's themes are: the nature of human knowledge, the affliction of pride, the blindness and tyranny of self, the boundaries of reason, the hiddenness of God, and his own argument for \\"wagering\\" not only on God, but on the Christian faith. Two things are obvious; (1.) the arguments are not in the form in which Pascal intended to offer them, therefore, (2.) this is not a definitive apologetic. However, Pascal's arguments are rather unique and as such they are interesting even in their [often] crude form. Read this book in conjunction with the writings of C.S. Lewis, Augustine, or Sundar Singh.	2002-07-25

It has been said that all philosophic work of the past 2400 years stands as footnotes to Plato's writings. 'Do the ends justify the means? What is justice? Whom does it serve? Who should serve as its guardians? Is it absolute or relative?'<br />Plato's protagonist is his old teacher, Socrates. The arguments are presented as dialogues and thus embody a literary aspect different from many, although certainly not all, subsequent philosophical writings. His object is \\"no trivial question, but the manner in which a man ought to live.\\" The answers are seen to point to the manner in which a utopian society should be operated.<br />As a storied mountain calls to a climber from afar, Plato calls to the student of the art of thinking. This is why we read Plato, for the \\"neo-Platonists\\" -- Plotinus, Augustine, Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, Whitehead, G&ouml;del, and others -- have certainly propounded improved philosophy. But it is Plato on whom they improve. Most thinkers (perhaps especially most mathematicians and logicians) yet agree with Plato, at least insofar as his understanding of \\"form\\" -- often adapted or restated as: ideas / perfection / consciousness / mind / or, 'the thing in itself'.<br />Plato's realm of [what he calls] \\"forms\\" acknowledges the mysterious, yet logically necessary, existence of non-material reality. In Republic he views this as the realm of reference in constructing his understanding of an ideal society. We find in the work of subsequent thinkers (and within Plato's Republic as well) that this non-material reality is perhaps more easily recognized in purer considerations of reason, aesthetics, mathematics, music, love, spiritual experience, and ultimately in consciousness itself, than in idealized human social institutions. Mathematics, for example, although readily practiced in material ways, is not itself material. Thus the understanding of the purity of reason as opposed to the synthetic (and uncertain) nature of empiricism, arises from the work of Plato (and is particularly well developed in Descartes' existentialism).<br />Modern readers should rightly find that Plato regards the State too highly; in pursuit of an ideal State his supposedly improved citizen is highly restricted and censored. His \\"utopian\\" citizens are automatons, bred by the State; unsanctioned infants are \\"disposed of.\\" Where his ideas are wrongly developed, they are in fact important ideas, i.e., they are issues deserving serious examination. Should the ruling class be restricted to philosophers? Plato says yes, that wisdom and intellectual insight are more desirable in leaders than are either birthright or popularity. Of course we, in the democratic West, tend to see this idea as totalitarianism, but it remains an interesting argument.<br />Although the product of polytheistic culture, Plato is leery of the tangled accounts of the gods received from the poets, Homer, Hesiod, etc. His view of the divine -- that \\"the chief good\\" has one eternal, unchanging and surpassingly superior form -- which he also calls \\"Providence\\", hints strongly of the common ground which was to emerge between neo-Platonism and monotheism. Like Plato's proverbial cave dwellers, we perceive this transcendent entity through poorly understood \\"shadows\\" of the actual truth. Beside its philosophical, literary, political, and theological aspects, Republic is also important as a treatise on psychology, in fact the science of mind seems to have progressed very little beyond Plato's insights.

The writings of Philo Judaeus (Philo of Alexandria, c20 BC - c50 AD) are important to the historical examination of late Second Temple Judaism, the religious 'world' into which Christ came. A prominent scholar and exegete, Philo's writings are considered the most thorough and most representative documents illuminating Hellenistic Judaism. Philo is interesting to Christians because, like Saul of Tarsus (Paul the Apostle), he was a Pharisee, a student and interpreter of Hebrew Scripture. (The Pharisees were a scholarly rabbinical sect particularly known for their studies of the Pentateuch. Their exegetic work was esteemed such that they were held by many to be the spiritual \\"rulers\\" of Judaism. The Torah commentators who wrote the Talmud were Pharisees. They are generally criticized by Christians but it should be noted that they shared some important beliefs with Christians, namely the priority of the immaterial to the material, the promise of the Messiah, the existence of angelic beings, and of the Divine gift of eternal existence for those who enter a right relationship with God. The Pharisees famously opposed Jesus, but it is also known that a number of them became Christians. Philo however, who spent most of his life in Alexandria, and died c.50 AD, likely had little or no contact with Jesus' followers.) Not only a Hebrew scholar but a noted scholar within Alexandrian academe, Philo is an interesting expositor of Greek philosophy and mathematics of the period, showing a great fondness for Euclidean geometry and number theory. However, the exegesis of the scriptural Creation account and of the special laws and the Decalogue is the author's central focus. This complete and unabridged volume is no trivial work, perhaps only approached by the most serious-minded student.<br />From Philo's examination of the Creation account we learn that [two millennia ago] leading scholarship did not hold Genesis 1 to be a literal (i.e., scientific) accounting. Philo expresses certainty that Genesis 1 can only be rightly understood as spiritual allegory. \\"Literal\\" interpretations of Moses' language [within Genesis 1] must produce a god with a localized body, nostrils, mouth, hands, etc., wholly incompatible with the incorporeal God revealed in scripture (and required by reason, what kind of matter could the Maker of matter be made of?). The Creation account is rather understood as describing the relationship of Creator and creation -- God's intimacy (\\"hovering\\", Gen 1:2) and God's ultimacy (\\"over\\" the abyss, Gen 1:2). Philo's rejection of literal interpretations is often strongly worded: \\"let us take care that we are never filled with such absurdity...\\" and \\"let not such fabulous nonsense ever enter our minds.\\"<br />We note that the ideas contained in modern philology are often not the concepts which were understood in earlier ages. For example, \\"the heavens and the earth\\" was understood [at least by some] to mean three-dimensional space itself plus time -- as \\"the heavens\\", and the constituents of the matter contained within space and time -- as \\"the earth\\". Thus Genesis 1:1 speaks of creation ex nihilo, everything from nothing [interestingly, as does the inflationary big bang theory]. The creation of light, the \\"separation\\" of light and darkness; God's \\"breath\\", \\"image\\", \\"likeness\\", speech, sight -- all of these expressions are understood as spiritual revelations into the nature of God's relationship to his creation (and not as a science text). The modern fundamentalist \\"literal\\" interpretation of Genesis 1 tends to overlook significant theological and philological indicators and ignores ancient expositors like Philo, Origen, Augustine, and Aquinas, disingenuously [or ignorantly] claiming that interpretations other than the supposed \\"obvious\\" one are modern inventions. Philo examines several allegorical interpretations in depth. Of comparisons of man to God, Philo states: \\"Moses says that man was made in the image and likeness of God. And hesays well; for nothing that is born on earth is more resembling God than man. And let no one think that he is able to judge of this likeness from the characters of the body: for neither is God a being with the form of a man, nor is the human body like the form of God; but the resemblance is spoken of with reference to the most important part of the soul, namely the mind: for the mind which exists in each individual has been created after the likeness of that one mind which is in the universe as its primitive model, being in some sort the god of that body which carries it about and bears its image within it.\\"ll; for nothing that is born on earth is more resembling God than man.

In a certain sense, all of space and time is spiritual. God's presence pervades everything. Thus all people live in the spiritual world ... we either turn joyfully toward the light, or rebelliously toward the darkness.\\" -- Sadhu Sundar Singh<br />As an angry young Sikh distraught over his mother's death, Sundar Singh was preparing to take his own life when he experienced a visionary encounter, not with Krishna, but with Christ. He became a Sadhu, a wandering mystic, not pursuing a hermit-like existence, but traversing the jungles and high mountain passes to appear in remote villages and lend assistance and care to the poor and disease stricken, and to counsel spiritual seekers. In the early twentieth century, Singh led the life of a first century apostle. Western Christians will find Sundar Singh's parables and dialogues wonderfully lacking in western conventions. He eloquently describes the intellectual futility of trying to wage logical arguments against God's existence, his allegorical explanation of the Trinity is better than most, his teaching that there is but One source of peace, love, and understanding is the bedrock of Christianity (and all monotheism).<br />In Sadhu Sundar Singh we find a true Christian mystic, a student, a servant, a holy man. His ministry and teachings became known to millions, he was admired by hundreds of thousands, and loved by tens of thousands whose lives he touched. His life and teachings also caused certain interests to despise him and attempts were made on his life. He disappeared, alone in the high Himalayas, in 1929.<br />Singh was not a writer, he produced six small books (which contained much of the material used in this compilation), perhaps solely because admirers urged him to. Yet he offers an elegant economy of words, using familiar objects of the natural world as illustrations for his allegories and parables. His \\"warning to the West\\" remains a telling indictment of the spiritual numbness of Western materialism and of western \\"Christians\\" who embrace the doctrines of culture more dearly than the teachings of Christ. When, during a trip to Europe, Singh was chided for not being more concerned with twentieth century science, he asked his questioner to what he referred. \\"Natural selection, you know, survival of the fittest,\\" blustered the questioner. \\"Ah,\\" Singh responded, \\"but I am more interested in divine selection, and the survival of the unfit.\\"r his allegories and parables.

But in itself it always does honor to the understanding and is even meritorious and necessary, as long as it is applied to an object worthy of observation.\\"<br />Between Plato's \\"pure reason\\" and Stephen Hawking's cosmological \\"horizons\\" stands Immanuel Kant, reaching out across the annals of critical thought, intent on disciplining the human mind in its pursuit of truth.<br />\\"All nature actually is nothing but a nexus of appearances according to rules; and there is nothing at all without rules. When we believe that we have come across an absence of rules, we can only say that the rules are unknown to us.\\" With these words, Kant begins his examination of the relationship of cognition and logic, seeking to reduce the science of thought to rules of pure reason.<br />The history of the science of logic has produced a rather short list of so-called greats -- Aristotle, Leibniz, Wolff, Kant. Logic may be defined as the [fairly concise] science of all other sciences, and as Kant points out, not many giants or revolutionaries are needed. What the science of logic always lacks is simply this -- persons who are cognizant of it.<br />To this end Kant offers his Logic, published in 1800 as a text for his philosophy students.<br />Squeezing large ideas into small words is always a great difficulty when the pursuit is one of exactitude. If this isn't immediately self-evident then Kant's extensive focus on definitions make this aspect of logic painfully clear. He acknowledges the limitations of the human mind in its separateness from pure truth, asking, \\"What can man, as man, know at all?\\" The problem of language is a very large part of the human mind's difficulty and is addressed by Kant in the constant offering of definitions and comparisons of definitions. Thus portions of the text are tiring, but put on your \\"thinking cap\\" and hang in there. Kant abruptly steps from the tedious dictionary of Kant into brilliant sequences of reason that will excite the understanding and sensibility of the reader.

The cowman who cleans his range of wolves does not realize that he is taking over the wolf's job of trimming the herd to fit the range. He has not learned to think like a mountain. Hence we have ... rivers washing the future into the sea.&quot;	2002-07-24

I will try to minimize references to the flaws because the book was generally a joy to read. Payne has spent his passion on whales and presents a treasure trove of information, about the behavior, history, plight, and politics of the great cetaceans. Where he sticks to empirical science (which fortunately is most of the book), the eminent whale biologist takes the reader along on a wonder-filled journey beneath the waves. Accounts of his personal life fit nicely with accounts of his work. The reader comes to feel that, in some sense, he knows right whales and humpbacks, and knows Mr. Payne. The insights into the psychology, economics and politics of whaling are fascinating and troubling and are issues with which more people should have some familiarity.<br />The book is so good that I almost hate to offer any detracting comments, but in the interest of truth I must: (1.) Payne assigns a kind of well-intended and hopeful 'happy face' to zoological and marine parks. Yes, zoos and marine parks do educate the public, but that education is primarily this -- that wild animals make excellent and profitable corporate merchandise. For compelling counterpoint read Jack Turner's The Abstract Wild. (2.) Payne's metaphysical musings are too typical of a large number of biologists. Gaia is not science; it is a philosophy of aesthetics similar to aboriginal pantheism. The concept of \\"collectively immortal\\" biology presents the conclusion that, as Payne says, Life is god. It makes for a pleasant enough concept until it is subjected to critical analysis. Some priests of biology should (collectively?) think a little deeper. One needn't adopt a Star Trek religion or a form of shamanism to respect bio-diversity. Assailing Christianity because it was the claimed practice of \\"God fearing\\" and blood thirsty sea captains is as logically dubious as attacking biological science because it was the claimed practice of a Dr. Josef Mengele, is the claimed practice of the Japanese \\"scientific\\" whaling industry, and is in fact the practice of developers of biological warfare agents. The evil besetting nature is not theism, it is holy capitalism, saint self-interest, a god called greed, and hard-hearted indifference. In short, small minded selfishness. Most scientists, including Payne, are at their best when they stick with science (although the mathematical sciences have lent the world some excellent philosophers).<br />All nay-saying aside, this is a book well worth reading.Josef Mengele, is the claimed practice of the Japanese \\"scientific\\" whaling industry, and is in fact the practice of developers of biological warfare agents.

I was awake, with my eyes closed, when I had a dream. It was a small dream about time. I was dead, I guess, in deep black space high up among many white stars. My own consciousness had been disclosed to me, and I was happy.\\" Dillard, in this passage, proceeds to briefly explore the human abstraction of time and concludes \\"we all ought to be able to conjure up sights like these at will, so that we can keep in mind the scope of texture's motion in time. It's a pity we can't watch it on a screen.\\" The language here is typical of the book, however the author's expression of happiness and of a state of intellectual or emotional resolution is decidedly less typical.<br />After about 25 pages I had decided that this Pulitzer winner was too quirky to be readable. I can enjoy reading Einstein or Kant, but Annie Dillard wears me out. The book's strengths are, in large part, Ms. Dillard's artistic manipulation of the English language and emotional manipulation of the reader. She drops an eclectic selection of factoid nuggets into the discourse, many of them interesting. To what end is sometimes not clear.<br />If the standard of the reader (or reviewer) is one of abstract aesthetics, Pilgrim At Tinker Creek might be seen as a rare and outstanding literary work. If, however, the standard is one of lucidity, clarity, or logical persuasiveness, well -- by these criteria the book stumbles. Thus we have both rave reviews and grumbling ones.<br />Some have called this volume a twentieth-century Walden. It is not. And that's okay. Walden can't be redone. The author is a gifted, studied, and troubled mind. A fine receptor of information, she analyzes the world in language that is at once strangely beautiful and morose. One reviewer says that Ms. Dillard stalks her reader, I'd say it's frequently more like an assault. More than any other author I have read, I immediately find myself wondering \\"what kind of a mind writes stuff like this?\\" I have read that when she was young, her mother would find entertainment in approaching strange men in public venues and greeting them as a past lover, inferring that Annie was their love child. If this is true, we see that perhaps Ms. Dillard's penchant for emotional invasion is a genetic proclivity.<br />Is \\"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek\\" a great book, or is it an effusive blather, which has been overly hyped? Because the writing is emotionally inward, its value must be highly subjective, more so than most books. I suggest that it be read in small bites, allowing the reader to savor (if so inclined) and to contemplate the abstractions and storytelling.<br />The author seems to demand visceral reactions, [and, in case it is not apparent] my initial and my most visceral reaction was strongly negative.

Fourteen years after his trek around the coast of Baja California, Mackintosh, now a San Diego family man, is again drawn from the common world to a most uncommon journey. This time trekking southward in mountainous inland Baja with a pack burro. [I have had the great pleasure of meeting Graham Mackintosh and talking with him about his earlier book and about this one. For what it's worth, I found him to be the same gentle pilgrim that we meet in his writings.] &quot;There was something very compelling and liberating about surrendering... From now on there would be no Mitsubishi, no Microsoft, no modem, no modern world, and maybe no home or wife -- just [the burro] and me, my goal, my God, and the good, simple people of Baja California,&quot; muses Mackintosh in a moment of introspective single-mindedness. Something that I enjoy about his observations, thoughts, and interests, if how often they closely resemble my own; one example being his delight in the company of a certain species of bird which I also particularly enjoy -- and which never fails to exhibit and inspire a certain indescribable joy -- the black phoebe.<br />As in his earlier book, Into A Desert Place, frequently recurring samplings of the history of Baja (and Alta) California, including the accomplishments and abuses of the Spanish missionaries, are well related and seamlessly augment the story. Mackintosh labels himself 'a poor Christian and a worse Catholic' and, for this reader, many of the books finer moments center in the author's spiritual questionings, insights, struggles, perhaps heresies, visionary experiences, and graceful redemptions. &quot;Behind the cool, hard, smooth rock, I sensed that there was another reality close at hand. That's how far I had come! I had seen the solid, indubitable forms of the great mountains and valleys dissolve into extraordinary visions; and at times I had almost felt myself dissolving into the world... I sensed it wasn't just an illusion. For a few precious moments, I had been freed from my hobbles. I had looked and stepped beyond... The journey... seemed, in part, a vital preparation for a much bigger journey to come.&quot;ts, I had been freed from my hobbles. I had looked and stepped beyond...

We are creatures shaped by our experiences; we like what we know, more than we know what we like. ... Sagebrush is an acquired taste.\\"<br />Stegner taught writing at the University of Wisconsin and at Harvard, but he had a strong sense of place and his place was the West. He accepted a position at Stanford University where he spent many years, and became, what many consider to be, 'the dean of Western writing' (by which we do not mean that he wrote \\"Westerns\\"). In this volume, Stegner sacks the Hollywood myths, and addresses the far more fascinating realities of the West. Featured here is a studied and caring investigation of what lies between the 98th meridian and the Pacific Ocean; of the land's great beauty and vulnerability to human foolishness. The compilation of essays also includes the author's reflections on his own life and work in the West, and examines critically the work of several significant literary \\"witnesses\\" of the American West. He reminds the reader of what criticism is: \\"A critic ... is not a synthesizer but an analyzer. He picks apart, he lifts a few cells onto a slide and puts a coverglass over them... His is a useful function and done well, ... may even give the reader the illusion of understanding both the product and the process. But ... whatever they can analyze has to be dead before it can be dissected ... critical analysis explains everything but the mystery of literary creation.\\"<br />If you enjoy the works of John Steinbeck or Norman Maclean, or the powerful but fragile beauty of western lands, the essays collected in the Lemonade Springs are highly recommended.	2002-05-22

Augustine on Augustine, philosophy, sex, science, skepticism, scholarship, rhetoric, vanity, humility, foolishness, wisdom, reason, the human perspective, exegetics, time, and the attributes of God. 'Confessions' is truly one of the great works of western literature and the [Oxford World's Classics] translation by Henry Chadwick beautifully retains this literary quality (and is extensively and helpfully footnoted). Written and published circa 398-400 AD, Augustine's autobiographic Confessions is an important theological treatise. It is also historically significant in its revelation of a faltering Roman society and of the convergent thinking of Judeo-Christian theology and neo-Platonic philosophy. While many of the discussions are centered on a culture from which we are 1600 years removed, they are surprisingly relevant to a western society that we see is not so different.<br />Very interesting are Augustine's discussions of the physical characteristics and boundaries of 'time' -- in fact since about 1930, our 'scientific' understanding of time is, in some important aspects, identical to Augustine's. This is a subject with which every theist should be familiar ['time' is on their side, so to speak], yet, like others more concerned with what's on TV tonight, most are woefully ignorant. Of further interest (from the standpoint of apologetics) is Augustine's destruction of \\"linguistic paradoxes\\" which atheists and agnostics claimed (and still do claim) to prove God's non-existence. These arguments, which Augustine calls \\"jokes\\", must be waged against an erroneous characterization of \\"god\\". The arguments defeat only a temporally bounded \\"god\\", a humanized 'smarty-pants' version of God, which is something that, by definition, God is certainly not. The supposed 'paradox' arguments prove merely that no human-like being could be God, that nothing fully contained by space-time could be God, that no finite consciousness could be infinite (i.e., omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, and unchanging). In other words: not God equals not God. That humans pose such feeble arguments against God, and think them profound, is an example of what Augustine calls \\"learned ignorance.\\"<br />Augustine's exegesis of Genesis 1 is very well considered, and supported, and varies vastly from so-called literalist interpretations. Much like Philo 400 years earlier, Augustine concludes that the language of Genesis 1 is carefully constructed so as to make a fully \\"literal\\" understanding of Creation unknowable. Although less than is its Creator, the acts of Creation are a wonderful mystery beyond \\"slower minds.\\" While he clearly holds scripture to be without error, Augustine says that error-prone human minds are quick to over-simplify, misunderstand, and misrepresent the mysteries of an infinite God so far beyond the minds of men. Augustine understands Genesis 1 as both an introductory and advanced study of theology, and not as a text for 'Creation Science'. He points out that if references to God Himself in Genesis 1 are interpreted as literal descriptions, we must accept within the text ideas about God which cannot be reconciled to reason or Biblical theology. These relational references to God require spiritual and not physically literal understanding or else we must accept God to be bounded in space and time, a sloppy theology which cannot be reconciled to the scriptural Deity. By contrast, a spiritual [as opposed to a 'scientific'] interpretation, illuminates the nature of being and the will of \\"the One.\\" Augustine says that any exegesis but that of spiritual allegory is fraught with logical difficulty within the theology of scripture and without. Aware of the depth of many Christian's commitment to what they consider to be a literal interpretation of these texts, he states that his only desire is to seek Truth and that he does not wish to quarrel or debate, as no sincere interpretation fails to acknowledge the primacy, sovereignty, and grace of the Creator.No sincere exegetic stands in conflict with the teachings of Christ -- however, conflict over interpretation is an exercise in the vanities of humans trying to prove they are \\"right\\" and such conflict might easily violate Christ's commandment of Love. He cites 5 different interpretations of Genesis 1:1 and asks seekers of truth to bring humility, not pride or comfort or esteem for popular ideas or religious traditions to the study of scripture. \\"Spiritual persons ... exercise spiritual judgment,\\" says Augustine, and not \\"notions which they hold because of their familiarity with the fleshy order of things.\\" While the \\"literalist\\" exegesis tends to claim that its alternative is to reject the inspiration of scripture and perhaps the very existence of the Creator, the \\"spiritual\\" exegetic holds the Creator and His works, including divine inspiration, to be beyond logical refutation, beyond human vanity, perhaps beyond human understanding, causing, and then entering space-time and the material world from [infinitely] without. Eight centuries later, Aquinas was to express a similar exegesis of Genesis 1.<br />In Augustine, we find a man confronted with error: that of others, and his own shortcomings as well. We find a man much like David or Solomon; a burning intellect certain of its own inadequacy and \\"hungering and thirsting\\" for Truth. A prolific writer, Augustine is one of the most influential thinkers in western history, his thoughts being important to any study of theology, philosophy, or cosmology.

The book is a wonderful resource for anyone fascinated with this diversity. Beauchamp's catalog has no photos or drawings of the plants, and minimal descriptions. Latin taxonomy is used; where common names are mentioned, it is in a most general way. For these reasons, whether you are a botanist or an interested novice (like myself) you will want supplemental resources. However, the illustrated field guides, although easier to obtain, are less thorough. Beauchamp's Flora also lists areas in which the various species are found, and does so in a less general way than do the popular field guides. The location specificity can be very helpful, if, for instance, you find yourself questioning whether Wild Buckwheat occurs in the wild Bucksnort Mountains (but you will need to know that California wild buckwheat is more precisely known as Eriogonum before you can look it up). The book also lists the frequency of occurrence in cited locations.<br /><br />This volume may be hard to find, but it is an excellent resource for anyone interested in the region's botany.	2002-05-21

Israeli physicist and mathematical geneticist, Lee Spetner, illustrates the mathematical roadblocks to popular theories of organic macroevolution. Spetner's case is particularly devastating to what is called 'classic,' orthodox,' and/or 'ultra' - Darwinism. This is the theory of evolution featured in most biology textbooks and Spetner's case against it centers on the limits imposed on genetic adaptation by the firm mathematics of information theory. Discussing the difficulty of the idea that chance mutation could be the source of innovation for large-scale adaptation, Spetner points out that in a starting stable population of one million, given one million subsequent generations, a total of 10 to the 13th power individuals (if you wonder why this would be the approximate number, refer to any logical definition of a population stable enough to produce a million generations), the probability that a single adaptive recombination of DNA sequence would survive in the population requires a number of such recombinations approaching 10 to the 2,000th power. This surrealistically huge number from a population of 10 to the 13th. Note again that this is the probability of a SINGLE such genetic innovation surviving among what would be the GREATEST number of contributing mutations proposed by the NDT (the idea in this case being an attempt to mitigate statistical roadblocks by suggesting that mutations might be somehow 'stored up' within a genome). Darwin said that genetic innovations must occur in \\"inconceivably great number\\" to fuel the engine of macroevolution, and that a large number of these must survive. But the mathematics deny Darwin his fuel. \\"With this we see that copying errors, even if they are stored as potential recombinations, cannot provide the random variation needed by the NDT (Neo-Darwinian Theory).\\" Some will want to point out that genetic innovation is more likely to survive in small, unstable populations, but this idea actually leads to even greater mathematical difficulty. Some will claim that probability studies only establish the difficulty of macroevolution and not that it is impossible. But evolutionary theory provides for only a relatively small number of years -- less than 4 with a mere nine zeroes after it -- in which all of life must be accounted for. So much for the magic-wand of `evolutionary time'; it seems that the NDT, as it stands, is, in fact, mathematically impossible.<br />Spetner has been published in the mainstream literature, writing about evolution in journals like Nature and the Journal of Theoretical Biology. This volume is published by small Judaica Press and may never have the readership it deserves. This is unfortunate because the arguments presented are fundamental, mathematically sound, and do great damage to theories of large-scale biologic evolution as a process of \\"natural\\" mechanism. Spetner is hardly the first to demonstrate the mathematical refutation of neo-Darwinism. Mathematicians Schutzenberger, Hoyle, Wickramasinghe, and others have done so. Spetner also debunks the popular, but strangely non-critical, claim that relatively quick changes in specifically cited populations (such as shifts in the melanism of peppered moths) could be an example of 'punk-eeq' theories of abrupt evolution. Such examples do not provide the population with any new innovation within the genome. One (already extant) gene is simply selected while another gene is subtracted from the genome. No complexity has been added, any change in the genome is in fact a subtraction of information. The author does not insist that large-scale evolution is impossible, and contrary to what some have said, he is not a 'young-earth creationist', but he does conclude that no theory of mechanistic evolution has the necessary tools (mechanisms) available to be a workable theory. Only Intelligently orchestrated evolution could bypass the lack of natural mechanism and the mathematical roadblocks to neo-Darwinian theory. Says Spetner, \\"The NDT not only stands in the way of a better understanding of the life sciences, it also tends to prevent us from appreciating that there may be spiritual values in the universe that stem from a source higher than man.\\"<br />When pitted against the mathematical difficulties confronting evolutionary theory, we often hear statements to the effect that biology cannot be understood mathematically. This argument is disingenuous. Mathematics is the \\"servant and queen\\" of physics, chemistry, and non-evolutionary disciplines of biology. Why must this supposed incompatibility of science and mathematics come into such sharp focus in theories of macroevolution alone? Might the theories be seriously incorrect?\\"The NDT not only stands in the way of a better understanding of the life sciences, it also tends to prevent us from appreciating that there may be spiritual values in the universe that stem from a source higher than man.\\"   When pitted against the mathematical difficulties confronting evolutionary theory, we often hear statements to the effect that biology cannot be understood mathematically.

Science writer Fred Heeren delivers a thorough, yet concise and very readable, presentation of recent findings in astronomy and cosmology, interviewing Nobel laureates, several of the most prominent people in astrophysics and cosmology (Smoot, Jastrow) and theoretical physics (Guth, Hawking), and perusing the ideas of leading mathematical physicists (Penrose, Davies, Barrow). While it is a fascinating look at the current state of physical science, it is also a deeply thoughtful treatise on the spiritual implications of our emerging knowledge. We find ourselves in an amazing universe, carefully and &quot;finely tuned&quot; and as Smoot says &quot;perfectly orchestrated&quot; with unimaginable precision by a &quot;super intellect&quot; [Einstein's description]. A genuinely skeptical consideration of the attempts to 'explain' our existence within these impossible parameters in any mechanistic (materialistic) way (e.g. the anthropic principles) is found to be irrational, illogical, unscientific, &quot;fundamental goofiness of human nature.&quot; &quot;Many skeptics aren't skeptical enough. Most people who call themselves skeptics are really just skeptical about one side of an issue...&quot;, states Heeren. &quot;Some of the world's greatest people of faith started out as the world's greatest skeptics ... Logic can lead us to the very threshold of faith, but then it is up to the human spirit to make a choice.&quot;<br />While many might accept that extensive evidence for an intelligently designed universe is best explained, in fact is only explained, by the very real existence of an Intelligent Designer, they often claim skepticism that the Designer is the personal God that Christians claim him to be. But is the idea of a disinterested Creator really logical? &quot;What kind of God best explains the facts,&quot; asks Heeren. Can the care which we observe in the implementation of this universe be consistent with a Creator who doesn't care? This book is for the skeptic, for the scientist, for the honest agnostic, for the Christian believer, for the interested seeker of truth. &quot;You aren't a real skeptic if you don't examine the evidence for yourself.&quot;the scientist, for the honest agnostic, for the Christian believer, for the interested seeker of truth. &quot;You aren't a real skeptic if you don't examine the evidence for yourself.&quot;	2002-04-14

Bookstore shelves sag with with biographies of desperately uninteresting pop culture icons, self obsessed tycoons, and hollow celebrities. The tedious &quot;rich and famous&quot;. But not all biography is so empty. Berlinski, brilliant and difficult, might be the perfect examiner of Newton: &quot;Isaac Newton is the largest figure in the history of western science, his influence both inescapable and immeasurable... Newtonian mechanics is not only the first, but the greatest of scientific theories... it embodies a combination of simplicity and scope still denied any other scientific theory... Despite the brilliance of his reflected light, he himself stands where I suspect he wished to stand -- in the shadows.&quot; Like any work of Berlinski must be, this is an uncommon experience of mathematics and disciplined thought, presented in an effusion of verbal chromatics. A more widely accessible work than his A Tour of the Calculus.<br />Says the author: &quot;Like Einstein, his spiritual heir and only equal, Newton viewed mathematics as an instrument. In thinking about the calculus, Newton was already thinking beyond the calculus, planets in motion and falling objects moving across the enormous corridors of his mind.&quot;	2002-04-14

An artful and extraordinarily literate romp through the history of mathematical thought and the emergence of one of science's must fundamental tools, the calculus devised by Newton and by Leibniz. Berlinski's mathematics is well paced and at times humorous -- a little like having Groucho Marx as a math teacher [as in this remark]... &quot;The constant, power, and root functions are included in the vast archipelago of polynomial functions, the term polynomial unaccountably suggesting Polynesia and so drawing a lovely but lunatic verbal association between the nature of these functions and their name.&quot; At other times he paints rich word pictures on the imagination to illustrate what might otherwise be more opaque ideas. Advanced mathematics is after all a quite exacting discipline and there's plenty of that here as well, but the author isn't insistent that the reader completely understand all the math. The idea here is to see mathematics as a thing not only of utility but of great beauty, and of mystery as well. One needn't completely understand a hummingbird to see it's beauty. An unusual book by a clever writer enraptured with his subject. If you've ever thought that math (and mathematical science) might be just a little bit fun, might posses beauty and expose transcendent truths, then you might enjoy this book. But be forewarned, this is not a book to make learning of the calculus 'easy' and it is not 'light reading.' It is engaging, illuminating, invigorating, [that's my opinion, many would disagree]. The author is as taken with words as he is with numbers and may at times cause the reader to struggle with each.	2002-04-14

The hallowed dictums of popular science-whimsy collide heavily with the observed and quantified realities of biochemistry; and the elegant realities are quite amazing indeed. Behe, a working research biochemist and professor of biochemistry, invites the reader into the sophisticated , lilliputian world of life's chemistry. Upon close examination of several \\"molecular machines\\" (complex biochemical cascade systems such as immune systems), the neo-Darwinian insistence that these systems developed gradually stands in unsupported defiance of real-world chemistry and relevant calculations. Behe then invites the reader into the evolutionary literature on the origin of these systems, where is found silence, vague whimsical assertions, hazy imprecision, falsified ideas, and a lot more silence. The mechanistic molecular evolution of complex biochemical systems is an idea that is shown to avoid specificity, avoid numbers, even avoid naming the chemicals involved. The rare attempts at specificity are shown to undermine the premise. Behe points out that \\"when such critical questions are ignored we leave science and enter the world of Calvin and Hobbes.\\" If you're interested in biology and have read Richard Dawkins or Stuart Kauffman, you should read this book as counterpoint (and Lee M. Spetner's Not By Chance, as well). Setting aside issues of mechanical neo-Darwinism versus Intelligent Design, the book is a wonderful revelation of how life works, and how it doesn't.<br />About those oddly frantic negative reviews: A religiously beloved paradigm is being cast as the proverbial emperor without clothes. Devotees enamored with the paradigm, must, a priori, hate the very idea of such a book. The critics' assaults presuppose the existence of mechanism(s) that are not known to exist and appear to be mathematically impossible. Thus the theory has taken on a 'magic wand'-like mythological air. The problem is real, and is only dismissed with appeals to increasingly convoluted jargon-ese. Most of the recurring complaints against Behe are trivial and generally peripheral to Behe's arguments, which are self-evidently sound (especially as compared to those of Richard Dawkins, for example).

A substantive 'tour' of the Christian disciplines -- study, meditation, service, simplicity, and so on. In its first printing this book quickly became a Christian classic. Foster draws on the thoughts and counsels of Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Kierkegaard, Merton, Bonhoeffer, Kelly, Wesley, and many others, and the thoughtful pilgrim will here find both practical instruction and reflective inspiration. Of the discipline of study Foster says: &quot;It soon becomes obvious that study demands humility. Study simply cannot happen until we are willing to be subject to the subject matter... Study is an exacting art... Most people assume that because they know how to read words they know how to study. This limited grasp of the nature of study explains why so many people gain so little from reading books.&quot; This volume is a beautiful study of how to live the Christian life, understanding and embracing its &quot;exacting art&quot;.	2002-04-14

Greene, a leading string theorist, lucidly explains the central aspects of Einstein's relativity and of quantum theory -- both strong theories -- and how they conflict with each other. The implication: nature requires a deeper explanation. Philosophical reductionists and idealists (so-called Platonists, if you prefer) agree on this much, but disagree on the fundamental question of how \\"ultimate\\" any theory of physics can actually be. Early in this volume, Greene states an affinity for the reductionist's view that an ultimate theory of everything should \\"not require or even allow for a deeper explanatory base.\\" Regarding the idea that an ultimate and final explanation lies within the access of scientific endeavor, he concedes that \\"some agree... some don't.\\" As the book progresses into superstring theory, topology, Calabi-Yau spaces, eleven (or more) dimensions, space-time tearing, and cosmological considerations, the approach is one of generally cautious methodological reductionism, the sound scientific approach with which philosophical idealists will have little if any disagreement. In the two concluding chapters, Greene assumes a reflective and circumspect sobriety with an increasingly Platonic tone. The literary quality of the book is strong, the science as rigorous as most readers would want. \\"Ultimate\\" or not, a deeper explanation of nature is required. In Greene's words, \\"string theory is the only way we know of to merge general relativity and quantum mechanics.\\" The book is an excellent presentation of the history and current state of string theories, including M-theory. But a truly \\"ultimate\\" theory? The case for that claim is clearly unconvincing, as it must be. Greene recognizes this and, in the end, the ardent philosophical reductionist, i.e. one who believes that ultimate explanations must be mechanistic and accessible to science, may be disappointed. Admitting that the reductionist's faith in a mechanistic TOE may prove to be naive, \\"brash posturing,\\" he reflects, \\"the history of science teaches us that each time we think that we have it all figured out, nature has a radical surprise in store for us that requires significant... changes in how we think the world works.\\" As Leibniz' cutting logic yet illustrates, the question of \\"how\\" the world works may be the ultimate question which can be addressed by science, but it is not the ultimate question. The idea that a physical theory of everything might be understood as the fully 'ultimate answer' is not a logically defensible claim, but rather a problematic article of faith. Again to his credit, Greene explains this.<br />The mysterious and complex world of string theory is not easily translated from its native language, that of mathematics. But with its mathematical model of the elusive graviton, string theory presents physics with an opportunity to reconcile relativity and quantum theory. Greene writes wonderfully and does an admirable job of bringing strings to the non-physicist.e reflects, \\"the history of science teaches us that each time we think that we have it all figured out, nature has a radical surprise in store for us that requires significant... changes in how we think the world works.\\" As Leibniz' cutting logic yet illustrates, the question of \\"how\\" the world works may be the ultimate question which can be addressed by science, but it is not the ultimate question.

Smoot's book chronicles the excitement, frustrations, and adventure of the work of science, focusing on his careful efforts and eventual triumph with the COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) satellite project. Stephen Hawking calls Smoot's observations &quot;the scientific discovery of the century, if not all time&quot;. The reader easily comes to identify with the author and his work -- &quot;In the predawn darkness, not far away, fifteen years of work were sitting atop many tons of high explosives. If it blew to bits, what would I do? ... I had seen the [Delta] rocket close up, and had been aghast at how decrepit it looked, rusting here and there... Our professional life's work was on top of that thing. We didn't say a word, only silent prayers.&quot;<br />The author explains well the theories, predictions, discoveries, and conundrums of cosmology. The explanation of Guth's inflation theory is particularly lucid. In summarizing the startling discoveries of recent astrophysical observation, Smoot reposes in the wonder of the created order with these words: &quot;[Steven] Weinberg muses... 'The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless.' I must disagree with my old teacher. To me the universe seems quite the opposite of pointless... The more we learn, the more we see ... there is an underlying unity to the sea of matter and stars and galaxies ... we are learning that nature is as it is not because it is the chance consequence of a random series of meaningless events; quite the opposite.&quot;	2002-04-14

Foster wonders if he is the right person to write this book, and indeed who would be. (It seems clear that he was exactly the right person.) Our culture is at war with simplicity. Material neediness is almost demanded of us. We need new stuff -- techno-toys, fashions, cars, amazing new whatnot. Says Foster: \\"Stress the quality of life above the quantity of life. Refuse to be seduced into defining life in terms of having rather than being. Cultivate solitude and silence. Learn to 'listen to God's speech in his wondrous, terrible, gentle, loving, all-embracing silence'... Value music, art, books, significant travel. If you are too busy to read, you are too busy... Learn the wonderful truth that to increase the quality of life means to decrease material desire...\\" Foster leads the reader to understand that Christian simplicity is not merely a reinvention of self focus, a stripped-down version of self indulgence. It is both carefully inward-looking and thoughtfully outward-looking, always seeking to need only One. This is not the Christianity that the skeptic will find easy to assail, but rather the type of human concerns illuminated by Christ: \\"A million hogs in Indiana have superior housing to a billion humans on this planet.\\"	2002-04-14

Lewis does an effective job of exploring the moral argument and then moves forward into presuppositional arguments. You may or may not agree with Lewis -- many fundamentalists struggle with his positions, as of course do atheists -- but anyone interested in questions of God's existence and nature will do himself a favor in reading this book.<br />Discussing his own journey from atheism to Christianity, Lewis relates: \\"... in the very act of trying to prove that God did not exist -- in other words, that the whole of reality was senseless -- I found I was forced to assume that one part of reality -- namely my idea of justice -- was full of sense. Consequently atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning.\\"	2002-04-14

The subtitle here is \\"a spiritual geography\\" -- the book is roughly 20 percent northern prairie geography and 80 percent Norris' fascination with asceticism and monasticism. The book's great appeal to me centers on the fact that I spent my youth on these prairies and I recognize this landscape of drifting snow and lonely, abandoned buildings. Says Norris: \\"I prize the hiddenness of Dakota, ...[places] that in all likelihood few humans have ever walked... Dakotans know why they like living here, where life is still lived on a human scale...\\"<br />I found the prose evocative of Wallace Stegner's non-fiction, but with a deep spiritual center. The spirituality here is interesting, but (for me, at least) wears thin like the aging boards on a wind-bent barn. The life apart may be, in many ways, the spiritual easy-life, too easily romanticized. You'll find better books addressing meditative and practical spirituality. Perhaps I judge too harshly, you'll also find far worse. Within the scope of the physical and metaphysical landscapes considered, the book is an important one and Norris succeeds in wresting words from wells deeper than mere language.	2002-04-09

Chapter two, second paragraph: \\"The Milky Way galaxy contains 200 billion stars...\\"<br />Chapter two, a few pages later: \\"Fifteen billion is also more or less the number of stars in the galaxy.\\" Obviously, the number of stars in the galaxy is not precisely known, but we do know that 15 billion and 200 billion are two different things. One of the author's \\"truths\\" is self-evidently not true. Purveyors of \\"truth and beauty\\", whether scientists, gurus, philosophers, spiritual leaders, or journalists, often regard their subject and their audience far too casually. Here we have a case in point. Perhaps most books contain 'typos' and the miscues inherent to humanity, but here it seems that both the author and the editor were asleep at the wheel, something that needs to be addressed if the book achieves a second printing (and I don't see why that would happen).<br />The subject is truly fascinating; or at least it should be -- the relationship of aesthetics, mathematics, and logic. At the deepest levels of the human intellect's inquiries, the answers are all about a mysterious mathematical beauty. The reality of this escapes most people, which is why the \\"National Bestseller\\" heading on the cover of Cole's book intrigued me. Apparently the book has enjoyed a larger readership than most such popularizations. Unfortunately the superficial, disjoined 'newspaper style' of science serves the material poorly. The writing rambles almost aimlessly. The books of many mathematicians and physicists have examined the relationship of reality, reason, mathematics, and aesthetics. Devlin's 'The Language of Mathematics' is very good. Fairly recent works by Penrose, Davies, Rucker, Berlinski, Greene, and others come to mind. Some of these books are far better than others. This volume is one of the others.	2002-04-04

My daughter tells me I should occasionally read fiction. \\"To be more 'well rounded',\\" she says. She asked me to read Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. I had tried reading Tolkien about thirty years ago. I just couldn't -- too many odd, invented proper nouns. And worse. Elves, dwarfs, Hobbits, trolls, orcs, Barrow-wights, Dark Riders, wizards, Rangers, a Balrog (\\"This is a foe beyond any of you\\"), and even more mysterious beings? Be serious -- not worth the effort, I thought.<br />Well, I read The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. I had difficulty making my peace with those strange place names and those stranger character names, yet I pressed on. Eventually I found a pretty good story. In truth, I believe the story is something beyond the genre-pioneering work of epic fantasy that critics generally consider Tolkien's Rings books to be. There are certain philosophical and spiritual themes as well. This strong undercurrent is not difficult to find, yet the reader need not recognize it (I'm guessing that many do not) to enjoy the adventurous journey, as Frodo warns his friends: \\"You speak of danger, but you do not understand. This is no treasure-hunt, no there-and-back journey. I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.\\"<br />Some say the story beneath the story is one of environmental stewardship (I don't know, this wasn't a burning issue in Tolkien's England). Others tend toward the theistic themes of providence (an abstracted 23rd Psalm?) or the relentless conflict between virtue and evil. Some cite social or even political themes -- a bit of a reach on the latter, I'd say. Only a servant of the Dark Lord would deny the theistic themes. The story is rich and deep enough to support all of these ideas, and too much may be made of them; if Tolkien had wished to pen a philosophical dissertation he would have done so. The Fellowship is the first of the highly imaginative Rings trilogy. A good book, even if fiction will never be a genre with which I spend a high percentage of my reading time.a high percentage of my reading time.	2002-04-03

Davies is a professor of mathematical physics who has worked on theoretical models of quantum cosmology and has pursued studies into what kind of universe(s) might be described by suggesting the most minute alteration(s) of nature's constants. He is also a scholar well versed in philosophy and in the philosophical aspects of scientific thought. Why does science work, the author asks. Why is physical reality so wonderfully defined by the 'mindscape' of aesthetics and mathematics? Do the great minds of ages past, Plato, Augustine, Leibniz, Kant, help us with these questions?<br />The title invokes a well known phrase from Albert Einstein's musings and refers to the mind-bending specificity and genius that underlies the physical world. Says Davies: \\"I belong to the group of scientists who do not subscribe to a conventional religion but nevertheless deny that the universe is a purposeless accident. Through my scientific work I have come to believe more and more strongly that the physical universe is put together with an ingenuity so astonishing that I cannot accept it merely as a brute fact. There must, it seems to me, be a deeper level of explanation. Whether one wishes to call that deeper level 'God' is a matter of taste and definition. Furthermore, I have come to the point of view that mind -- i.e., conscious awareness of the world -- is not a meaningless and incidental quirk of nature, but an absolutely fundamental facet of reality.\\"<br />It is interesting that for many mainstream mathematicians, physicists, and cosmologists, reality is something quite different than the construct preferred by most mainstream biologists. Davies, like Einstein, is particularly fascinated with the fundamental question of why nature should be knowable at all; why science itself is inevitable. That this is the condition of our universe presents us with implications we cannot ignore, although many try. The committed philosophical materialist and the hip and happening atheist may find this book to infer conclusions that are difficult to accept; it may challenge fundamental assumptions. The impenetrable opaqueness to science of certain mysterious realities has been described by Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger and in more recent years by Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose, astrophysicist John Barrow, and a great many others. Even the most ardent philosophical reductionist must admit the reality of mystery, especially when we consider the deepest explanatory bases.

Truths impervious to rationalism? Can it be? It can, and as is implied by G&ouml;del's incompleteness theorem, this is not so surprising.

He was a dominant figure in the Idealist school of philosophy labeled Transcendentalism. Emerson called Thoreau the truest American. This because of his passionate respect for the dignity of the individual. Years before the Emancipation Proclamation or the Civil War, more than a century before the American civil rights movement or the global push for 'human rights', there was Thoreau's Resistance to Civil Government, which is commonly titled Civil Disobedience. (Mahatma Gandhi acknowledged Thoreau's influence on his life as did Martin Luther King, Jr.). Several decades before the environmental movement was born and ecological awareness began to seep into public consciousness, while John Muir was but an infant, there was Walden. On issues of human dignity, moral consistency, environmental responsibility, even diet and health, he was as an unappreciated light in a gray world of small thinking. In his short life, he had rather few readers and was generally thought of as being a nutty malcontent, as has been the case for so many thinkers of antiquity and of today.<br />\\"The greater part of what my neighbors call good I believe in my soul to be bad,\\" states Thoreau, who like other great Idealist thinkers insists that Truth and the crowd generally stand in opposition to one another. Solitude being the state in which one can \\"discern his proper objects,\\" Thoreau's record at Walden Pond is a wonderful account of such discernment. In his opening treatise on economy, Thoreau says that philanthropy is esteemed so highly only because we are so selfish. It is in his less provocative yet careful analysis of objects of nature that Thoreau delights his reader. His account of a battle between an army of red ants and an army of black ants is meticulous and absolutely wonderful.

The choice is left to us. We must either love or hate, and not to love is to hate. So hostile are these two powers that the slightest inclination towards the one side becomes absolute opposition to the other. Let us not forget this tremendous danger in which we exist. To forget is to have made your choice.\\" To Kierkegaard, self confident rationalism was an inadequate window on truth -- was in fact an egotistical self-deception. His seemingly counter-intuitive insistence that objective thought is inherently incomplete and uncertain has been supported in our post-modern age by principles of quantum theory. But he was less interested in being \\"right\\" than he was in existing, which for Kierkegaard meant being ready for decisive action. For him, 'actions speak louder than words,' and decision embodies greater truth than does detached rationalism. He exposes the sacred cows of \\"Christendom\\" as rotting corpses. He provokes. The thinking Christian need not agree with Kierkegaard on all fronts, so to speak, but he should not avoid these provocations. As counter-point to common, sugar coated, and silly versions of religion, they must be considered. While Kierkegaard, like Kant, can be difficult, many of these selections are powerful and certainly worthy of the effort. It is when Kierkegaard writes of love and of forgiveness that he is most profound:<br />\\"... if your life expresses the little you have understood, you speak more powerfully than all the eloquence of orators.\\"	2002-03-24
US	52443550	R8MN5XL1FDWQ5	0816516995	306715667	The Abstract Wild	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Deep ecology	The modern paradigms of economics, science, philosophy, social science, and conservation strategies are here critically scrutinized. Turner takes no prisoners, assailing even those institutions and organizations that are near and dear to many environmentalists. Of course, some of his points might be argued against, but this reader finds himself to be most often in agreement with the author. The outdoor \\"fun hog\\" whose views of nature are those of Outside magazine (and of a great number of commercial interests which encourage the consumption of nature as a means of self-pleasuring), will find no comfort here. At the very least this book is serious food-for-thought for anyone who loves and attempts to understand the wild.<br />Turner's description of proximity to a mountain lion in the Tetons, and of his \\"unreasonable terror\\" at the thought of being the hunted, struck a common cord with this reader, although in my experience the terror was rather more reasonable. The sense of exhilaration which followed can hardly be articulated and perhaps exceeded that described by Turner (but I digress...).<br />Says Turner: \\"... go into a great forest at night alone. Sit quietly for a while. ... smell and hearing and touch reassert themselves. The wild is keenly sensual. ... The majority of Americans no longer know this experience of the wild. We are surrounded by national parks, wilderness areas, wildlife preserves ...We are deluged with commercial images of wildness. There are nature movies ... nature books ... yuppie outdoor magazines ... philosophical magazines, scientific magazines ... Zoos and animal parks and marine lands abound ... From this we conclude that modern man's knowledge and experience of wild nature is extensive. But it is not. Rather, what we have is extensive experience of a severely diminished wilderness ... a caricature.\\"	2002-03-24

Kant's foundational work for his extensive examination of ethics and reason. I picked up a copy in the Harvard book store (no, I was just visiting), perhaps inheriting it from a business or law student who might by now be struggling to ignore whatever he or she once learned of ethics (sorry -- I'm sure that's not the case...). Much as Einstein would one day struggle to establish physical principles independent of observational considerations, Kant undertakes to construct a philosophy of ethics \\"which does not permit itself to be held back any longer by what is empirical.\\" Kant himself might not have liked the analogy involving special relativity, but clearly science embraces his concept of universal law. Says Kant, \\"... wisdom -- which consists more in doing and not doing than in knowing -- needs science, not in order to learn from it, but in order that wisdom's precepts may gain acceptance and permanence.\\" Hard to argue with that.<br />Kant sets forward his categorical imperative -- \\"I should never act except in such a way that I can also will that my maxim should become a universal law.\\" He proceeds to illustrate and defend the imperative. The writing is extremely dense (by which I mean deliberate and exacting, not ill conceived). He anticipates and answers detracting arguments, undoubtedly including any that I might offer here. Some of his critics may not recognize that their objections have been dealt with (and Kant seems to anticipate even this). So is Kant right? Yes, or at the least mostly yes. If on some point he may be rebutted, he still wins the war, so to speak. So-called moral relativists will obviously disagree with his central premise, yet Kant remains one of the most influential philosophers of any age. He is cited frequently by ethicists, educators, scientists, and spiritual leaders.<br />\\"We find that the more a cultivated reason devotes itself to the aim of enjoying life and happiness, the further does man get away from true contentment. Because of this there arises in many persons, if only they are candid enough to admit it, a certain degree of... hatred of reason.\\"<br />-- I'd give it five stars if it was easier to read.s there arises in many persons, if only they are candid enough to admit it, a certain degree of... hatred of reason.\\"<BR>-- I'd give it five stars if it was easier to read.	2002-03-22

Issues regarding nonlinear phenomena and systems, as well as quantum physics, string theory, and philosophy of science are examined.<br />Physicists Davies and Gribbin, two of sciences most prolific writers, discuss the reasons for the impending death of the materialist paradigm which took an almost absolute grip on the philosophy of science immediately after the publication of Newton's Principia. In fact they state that (whether or not it is widely recognized) the reductionists' \\"mechanistic\\" paradigm is now dead. \\"It is fitting that physics -- the science that gave rise to materialism -- should also signal the demise of materialism. ...the new physics has blown apart the central tenets of materialist doctrine in a sequence of stunning developments. ...in the abstract wonderland of the new physics it seems that only mathematics can help us to make sense of nature.\\"<br />The problem is not that mechanistic Newtonian science is \\"wrong\\" but rather that it addresses only a limited representation of actual truth. The book also contains excellent descriptions of things like white dwarfs, neutron stars, and the difficulties in developing a quantum theory of gravity. Theories of wormholes, strings, and GUTs are well presented. The final chapter indulges in speculation about \\"exotic (non-carbon based, non-DNA based) biologies\\" -- which the authors concede should not be taken seriously -- and about the difficulties with ideas of \\"spontaneous generation\\" and \\"extra-terrestrial intelligence\\". The authors proceed to set aside their own cautions and speculate on these ideas, making the final chapter an exercise in science fiction. Otherwise a very good book.	2002-03-21

Some say this is Muir's finest work. As the only other Muir book I've read (at this writing) is Travels in Alaska, I cannot comment on this, other than to say that I enjoyed this book a great deal.<br />From almost any vantage point in California, whether near or on a distant horizon, there are mountains. A fact not lost on Muir, whose sense of wonder and love of life endear him to his readers.<br />&quot;God's glacial-mills grind slowly, but they have been kept in motion long enough in California to grind sufficient soil for a glorious abundance of life ... In so wild and so beautiful a region [was spent my day], every sight and sound inspiring, leading one far out of himself, yet feeding and building up his individuality.&quot;<br />Muir was the consummate man in nature. Anyone who is indifferent to Muir's writing may simply be indifferent to wonderment itself. I have no doubt that if Muir were placed in a room with the great kings and generals and tycoons and empire builders of history, he would appear singularly as a man among men. Unimpressed with their pomp and bluster over rotting empire, he might soon command more attention than they, and many would be happily listening to Muir in spite of their self importance. Why? He would have the most interesting insights, offered poetically and in a most humble and charming way. ... (in fact Muir was sought out by the great politicians and philosophers of his day).<br />If you like mountains, if you like California, if you like trees and glacier-fed streams, you will like this book.	2002-03-21
US	52443550	R1562XD4JN7WLN	0393312895	123576021	Into a Desert Place: A 3000 Mile Walk around the Coast of Baja California	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Come apart, into a desert place	A British \\"every man\\" who describes himself as being a self absorbed couch potato, walks alone around the rugged and remote coastlines of Baja California. The self-deprecating honesty and insight is unusual and refreshing. He persists through heat and drought, rock slides and dangerous tides, scorpions and thorny plants, daunting geological impediments, rattlesnakes, and sharks -- yet the story is more 'man in nature' than the more common and inane 'man against nature.'<br />Mackintosh's sensitivity to the lands he interacts with is fascinating, particularly given that he is afoot in a 'wild' land a hemisphere from his home, in an environment foreign to his previous life. \\"I didn't need anyone to tell me what was right and wrong. The land was sacred to me. I was a part of it. I wasn't one of a million careless tourists with their trucks, bikes and polluting toys. I was one in a million. The desert was special and my needs were special. There was no conflict. ... The sense of being special to a special place was very much part of the exhilaration and the experience. ... Yet, to put it into words was to distort it. The feeling was the reality and the mystery. It saddened me to think that I might never be able to share it with another person. 'In what concerns you much,' wrote Thoreau, 'know that you are alone in the world.'\\" Relevant recountings of historical events are woven into the narrative, as are the author's spiritual musings.<br />The whole-heartedness with which Mackintosh merges into a new landscape is complimented by the friendships which he easily forges with the ranchers and fishermen of rural and wild Baja, and their families. As a journal of wilderness travel, this may be one of the best books written in the twentieth century.	2002-03-21

From the shockingly superior optics of William Herschel to the elegant mathematics of John Couch Adams to the extra-solar planets discovered in the late 1990s to the techniques being now developed to find planets orbiting other stars -- its all fascinating. In the end, most of what you thought watching Star Trek had taught you about distant worlds is sacked. &quot;The idea that planetary systems around other stars will be broadly similar to our own solar system is no longer tenable. Indeed, as more planets are discovered, it is our solar system itself that starts to seem more and more unusual.&quot;<br />If you don't read science books and don't know why anybody would, this book might change your mind. Highly recommended.	2002-03-18
