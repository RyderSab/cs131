The author doesn't make this IgG/IgE distinction. There's no index and no apparent footnotes/endnotes.   <br /> <br />There are some interesting factoids, such as the fact that some animals have demonstrated hay fever, and you can ingest poison oak safely as long as it doesn't touch your lips. But I would have hoped for more background information on how the immune systems works w/ regard to allergies. <br /> <br />Originally published in 1959, my own copy was reprinted in 1982.  I see now that a 2nd edition was published in 1994, so you should buy that one instead.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-04

By stressing *listening* over reading, these tapes lead to excellent pronunciation, and the \\"graduated recall\\" system seems to improve retention.  The one thing I missed was that another tape set offered mnemonic devices (e.g., in spanish \\"bathtub\\" is \\"tina\\", so you imagine a girl named tina in a bathtub to help recall), so with Pimsleur I just make up my own as I listen.	2005-09-07

Fortunately, this book was a gift and so I didn't waste any money on it, but I found it an amusing romp through a bunch of flimsy psuedo-science. Some people have no shame, really. The concept of auras has been so thoroughly debunked that it's unbelievable that this book could be published in the 21st century. If you like non-fiction, as I do, I would recommend you avoid this book and instead read about the \\"magical\\" Northern Lights, the unbelievable migration of birds, the incredible social complexity of insects, the heavenly surprises discovered by science, or the mind-expanding beauty of the Grand Canyon. Otherwise, you might as well just read fiction. <br /> <br />	2005-02-21

My own experience is that my muscles don't feel so tight (short) and painful afterwards, and my workouts are faster.  I also find it's easier and more pleasant to focus on a static hold compared to doing full range work (and trying to maintain proper form).  And my joints feel better, oddly, perhaps because although the load on the muslces is higher, it's mostly in a \\"friendly\\" portion of my range of movement.  Lastly, I enjoy the high intensity of it.  <br /> <br />That said, my sense is that the equipment is more critical to success here than other methods.  You'll need a power rack with \\"spotter arms\\" or the like, and/or a partner as spotter.  I have experimented with using SC with stationary single-motion resistance machines, but (1) many machines can't supply the enormous weight you'll be holding, and (2) it can be difficult/impossible and risky to hurl yourself into initial position for the SC, unless the machine has elaborate range control (or, again, a spotter). <br /> <br />	2004-12-23

BTW, the author lists a LOT of errata on his website, enough to take over an hour to mark up my copy (5th printing).  Although it's nice he documents this so well, it's a pain in the rear, so you may want to verify the edition you're buying to avoid this extra effort. On page vi, above ISBN, look for reverse sequence; example: \\"10 9 8 7\\" indicates 7th printing (cryptic, I know).  Most recent printing is 15th edition (least amount of errata).  The book is loaded with equations and diagrams.  It would be nice to see more derivations, but at least the equations are there in the text, and in the appendix.  I thought a few other reviewers were a bit harsh.  The book is not perfect, but nevertheless a great resource.

During the week-long course that I took from him, there were just a few moments during field work when his claim that, for example, a \\"female juvenile mountain lion with a full bladder\\" had made those faint compressions in the ground debris challenged my belief system.  And his.. uhm.. somewhat loudmouth persona would be consistent with a bit of literary license.  There are also some claims on the internet that there was no actual \\"Grandfather\\" or \\"Rick\\" per se, but who knows and frankly who cares. His technical information is accurate (tracking, shelter, etc.), his story is moving, I have real appreciation for Tom Brown and the work he does, and found his warmth, humor, energy and dedication very irresistable.       You will notice that Carlos Castaneda, Dan Millman (Way of the Peaceful Warrior), Marlo Morgan (Mutant Msg Down Under) and others have likewise been accused of using various amounts of fiction in their \\"factual\\" books, but I found their books instructional and inspirational also.     So, armed with that caveat, I would say go buy this book. I highly recommend it.	2004-12-23

For example, classic indian frybread was actually concocted on the reservations; traditional native americans didn't have any of the ingredients listed in this book's recipe (flour, baking powder, powdered milk).  Some ingredients in this book (e.g., white wine, Neufchatel cheese, etc) are clearly not native.  But even ones that may seem native (honey, beef jerky, potatoes) are not native; at least, not in North America.  South American Indians did use some interesting ingredients: chocolate, potatoes, tomatoes, etc., but North American traditional food was comprised more of nuts, berries, game, squash, beans, corn, acorns, wild rice, fish.  If you're drawn to reservation food and don't care about authenticity, buy this book, and buy \\"Pow-wow Chow\\", which includes ingredients such as marshmallows, velveeta, spam, and many others ingredients that the original natives never ate but, alas, are readily eaten on many reservations.	2004-10-02

The basic gist is great... that Darwin's theory of evolution extends beyond the the simple theory of \\"survival of the fittest\\"... that it included a theory that our evolution encompasses a spiritual realm. But the book tries a bit too hard, in my humble opinion, and uses unnecessarily flowery sentence structures to make its point.  Along the way, the author gives credit to Darwin for discovering a main tenet of Chaos Theory, which seemed like a real stretch. But overall a nice balance to the common simplistic view of Darwin as a rigid/cold scientist and atheist.  Despite some disappointments, I recommend this book.	2004-02-03

Actually, if you want a very simplistic and sanitized view of Islam, this is a great book.  I mean it.  The first chapter or two might serve as a good introduction to the history of Islam.  However, my feeling is that a book on any religion should look at both the light and dark aspects honestly, instead of assuming a defensive, hand-waving posture.

Author Eric Van Daniken (Chariots of the Gods) would often begin with facts and then leap to outlandish theories, so merely having some research results to begin with is no guarantee that the conclusions are at all based on science.

For example, Howland doesn't explain *why* you need an inner cover... just says it's part of the hive.  He only provides *one* technique for queen introduction (albeit a good one), when there are several others.  Then he perpetuates the myth that you should scrape a bee's stinger away rather than pinch it away (Discover magazine, et. al., now dispute this), and when discussing *moving* a hive, he leaves out the \\"3 mile rule\\" and the \\"1 foot per day\\" approach, etc.  He suggests using motor oil moats to prevent ants (works great), but doesn't mention that vegetable oil and Tanglefoot work great also.
