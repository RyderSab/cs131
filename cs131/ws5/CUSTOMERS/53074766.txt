His widely-syndicated pieces appear in many American newspapers, but also many Arab and Muslim-world publications.<br /><br />Nominally a liberal and probably a Democrat, he has trod a fairly middle path, supporting globalization and laissez-faire capitalism, the subordination of individual countries' economic interests to global institutions such as multinational corporations and the International Monetary Fund, and the use of military force to further U.S. economic interests (including strong if uneasy support for the war in Iraq).<br /><br />In his new book, _The World Is Flat_, Friedman argues that recent technological and political developments have brought most countries much closer, broken down corporate walls and hierarchies, and raised both the stakes for American competitiveness on the world stage and the potential rewards for all. Friedman lists ten causes of the earth's flattening, from the fall of the Berlin Wall and supply-chaining, to out-sourcing and in-sourcing, by which specialists in one task become partners or pseudo-employees of their clients (e.g., UPS handling not only all deliveries for Papa John's Pizza and Toshiba, but even equipment repair for the latter).<br /><br />If all of this sounds a little too \\"rah-rah for capitalism,\\" well, that's how it reads. Friedman has wonderful stories to tell-about Third World startups, Web journalists launching with $200 of equipment and breaking stories of national impact, a 17-year-old confined to a wheelchair by severe cerebral palsy while becoming an eBay entrepreneur-but how he connects these dots is less persuasive.<br /><br />Roughly 85 percent ofThe World is Flat is boundlessly optimistic, but 15 percent of warning and possible doom nags at the reader for its potential to overwhelm the rest. Friedman notes the downside of working for, and living near, a Wal-Mart; China's voracious hunger for more energy (especially oil) and the effects on politics and the environment; the continuing scourge of HIV and malaria across the less developed world. Solutions to these problems are weak to nonexistent.<br /><br />There are too few zingers on the order of \\"too many politicians in America today . . . go out of their way actually to make their constituents stupid. . .\\" and \\"If . . . you are just a let 'er rip free market [fan]-you are not only cruel, you are a fool.\\"<br /><br />A whole book-a very different one-could have been based on his passing remark: \\"If President Bush made energy independence his moon shot, in one fell swoop he would dry up money for terrorism, force Iran, Russia, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia onto the path of reform-which they will never do with $50-a-barrel-oil-strengthen the dollar, and improve his own standing in Europe by doing something huge to reduce global warming.\\"<br /><br />There is much in this book to please and provoke thought, but perhaps its over-optimism might be tempered by a tandem reading of Jared Diamond's _Collapse_.d living near, a Wal-Mart; China's voracious hunger for more energy (especially oil) and the effects on politics and the environment; the continuing scourge of HIV and malaria across the less developed world.

Benjamin Franklin, with two major bios in the past three years (Morgan and Isaacson) and re-publication of others by H.W. Brands and Gordon Wood, may be the hottest. Into this crowd wades Stacy Schiff, whose elegant and witty biography of Vera Nabokov won a 2000 Pulitzer (and whose previous bio of Saint-Exup&eacute;ry garnered a nomination). Why step from uncommon byways onto a crowded boulevard?<br /><br />Happily, Schiff's breezy, cosmopolitan, but never superficial style is excellently suited to the open-minded satirist and scientist, and a tale that reads like a cruel farce. _A Great Improvisation_ focuses on just eight years of Franklin's 84-year life, starting in 1776 when he was sent to Paris by the Continental Congress at the age of 70 to get France into the war. Fortunately, France regarded Franklin as a celebrity genius, which was more than many of his colleagues back home in Congress thought of him.<br /><br />Franklin was \\"honest, but not too honest, which qualifies in France as a failure of imagination.\\" He could \\"indulge in the ingenious and wholly specious argument, a staple of French conversation.\\" His defense of French admiral d'Estaing was \\"a shining tribute to benevolent ignorance. (And one that happened accidentally to be accurate.)\\" Surrounded by spies, he had papers and money stolen. The other Americans in Paris squabbled endlessly with one another, accusing the French of deceit and intrigue even more than the British. Franklin's co-commissioner, Arthur Lee, \\"was ideally suited for the mission in every way save for his personality, which was rancid.\\"<br /><br />Poor trans-Atlantic communications enabled the Paris delegation's enemies to poison Congress against them, especially Franklin, who risked censure several times. He also was beset by psoriasis boils, gout and bladder stones. Schiff does not neglect Franklin's poor relations with much of his family, and his flirtations with French ladies, widowed and married. It's a wonder it all came out so well. Not a little of the credit goes to Franklin's skill as \\"a natural diplomat, genial and ruthless.\\" When he was \\"rebuffed, he played hard to get\\"!<br /><br />France ended up backing the colonies' successful revolution with men, arms, ships, and aid that would be worth $13 billion today. Americans who carp about Gallic \\"ingratitude\\" for their 1940s rescue might consider whether we were paying a 160-year-old debt.<br /><br />With writing this good, it's startling to encounter a false note: more than once, Schiff uses \\"adverse\\" when \\"averse\\" is the word she wants. The book also shows rare but regrettable signs of sloppy editing. Franklin's grandson Temple is said to be 18 upon their arrival in Paris in mid 1777, but thirty pages and five months later he is 17. The news of Burgoyne's capture as a prisoner after the Battle of Saratoga is reported to hit Paris on Dec. 4, 1778, which is a year late.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Schiff handles a broad array of characters and events with &eacute;lan. Her book reads like a spirited production by Merchant-Ivory.and married. It's a wonder it all came out so well.

An engaging writer and drily quotable, he published four dozen books and countless articles, served as adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and regularly blasted subsequent Republican administrations. Galbraith served on a post-war commission that studied strategic bombing of Germany (and concluded that despite its tremendous moral cost, it had had little or no effect on the Nazi war machine-much to our military's embarrassment), had a successful two-year stint as ambassador to India, was an early and vocal opponent of the Vietnam War, and even published three novels.<br /><br />Richard Parker presents the first substantial biography of this six-foot-eight-inch, Canadian-born Harvard professor who refused to hide in academia. As co-founding editor and publisher of \\"Mother Jones\\" magazine, consultant and fundraiser for Democratic candidates and Greenpeace, and finally Harvard professor of economics and public policy himself, Parker was almost uniquely situated to draw a richly sympathetic portrait. Galbraith is not an inherently interesting man, nor do his life and theories present an especially compelling read. What makes the book worthwhile is its mosaic of the many worlds through which Galbraith moved: It offers an excellent review of recent political and economic history, though the slant is decidedly liberal.<br /><br />It's good to be reminded that different political parties have repeatedly been thought dead (the Democrats in 1955 and 1985, Republicans in 1941 and 1965), only to rise again, and that the nation handled dire economic crises (inflation in 1971, the first oil crisis in 1973, the Depression itself), if uneasily and temporarily. Galbraith forecast the failure of Republican economic policies, the growth of corporate management that is unresponsive to shareholders and manipulates demand, and repeatedly scolded his profession for its increasing worship of complex mathematical modeling that ignores huge chunks of political and economic reality-such as burgeoning military budgets or the public good-to make the numbers work.<br /><br />He saw the details as well as the big picture, and practiced what he preached. Galbraith froze his own Harvard salary after his books began to sell, and turned back the surplus to his department. He gave his longtime housekeeper a condo upon her retirement, directed a percentage of his books' royalties to his assistant and editor, and set up an anonymous fund to assist students who found themselves unexpectedly pregnant.<br /><br />Parker seems to want to reach a broader, general audience, but his explanations of economic theory will leave lay readers lost. One would do well to keep a dummy's or complete idiot's guide to economics by one's elbow while reading this book.<br /><br />Not terribly lively but solid, this book offers plenty of consolation for the mournful blue stater who chooses to scale it, and food for thought about where we might (and maybe should) be headed.complex mathematical modeling that ignores huge chunks of political and economic reality-such as burgeoning military budgets or the public good-to make the numbers work. <br /> <br />He saw the details as well as the big picture, and practiced what he preached.

But Jeffrey Kluger, a staff writer at Time magazine and coauthor with commander Jim Lovell of Lost Moon (the inspiration for the Tom Hanks movie Apollo 13), has a decent excuse: 2005 marks the 50th anniversary of Dr. Jonas Salk's breakthrough. The World Health Organization has targeted this year to eradicate the virus from the planet (a few hundred cases have lingered in Nigeria, Pakistan, and India), and the Smithsonian plans a retrospective exhibition.<br /><br />Kluger nicely sketches the background for a medical achievement struck many as a miracle, and make Salk a reluctant mid-century media celebrity. When he was a child of Russian-Jewish immigrants in New York City, in 1916, more than 6,000 Americans died of polio in a year. Many more permanently lost the use of limbs. Though the numbers rose and fell, they averaged much the same for the next 40 years. Black city vehicles wrested sick children from their families and took them away to quarantine. Holiday celebrations were cancelled when the plague swept cities. Ignorance fed wild rumors such as one that blamed cats, whereupon 72,000 of them were beaten, drowned, and otherwise slaughtered by the citizens of New York.<br /><br />Salk was a brilliant but odd duck. He graduated from a high school for the gifted at 15, and entered medical school by 20. During the Second World War, he was part of the team that developed the first 'flu vaccine. Detail-oriented to the point of obsessiveness, he was more polite and attentive to waiters and repairmen than peers who could do him political good.<br /><br />Though muted, the story has its suspenseful turns and thrills. Competitors swear by a weakened live-virus vaccine while Salk pursues a killed-virus approach-carefully murdering yet structurally preserving the virus cells to goose the body's immune response. Test vaccines by other researchers fail, leaving dead children and ruined careers in their wake. Drug companies \\"improve\\" the vaccine Salk's team has already perfected, with procedures that lead to more polio cases. As an army of 20,000 doctors, 40,000 nurses, 1,000 support staff, 14,000 school principals and 50,000 teachers organized the 1.8 million children who would undergo the national field test in 1954, Walter Winchell's national radio broadcast called the vaccine a deadly failure, and warned that thousands of little white coffins were being readied to receive the resulting fatalities.<br /><br />Slices of parallel lives punctuate the tale nicely, from the future President stricken by the disease at age 39, after which he crusades for the funding and research to battle it, to the accounts of Kluger's still-living sources: John Troan, the science reporter for the Pittsburgh Press who carefully cultivated his relationship with Salk and was rewarded with inside stories and scoops, and several interviewees who were crippled as children and participated in the first field tests.<br /><br />Splendid Solution is not a heart-pounding page turner. In tone and style, it's a rather old-fashioned historical tale. But in its quiet manner, it is a terrific account, and well told.ildren and ruined careers in their wake.

Most active as a published author between 1960 and 1980, today Fowles may be better known to the general public through the movies that were made of his books -- one good (\\"The French Lieutenant's Woman\\"), one mediocre (\\"The Collector\\"), and one execrable (the little seen and little known \\"The Magus\\") -- than by the marvelous, enthralling books themselves.<br /><br />The \\"two worlds\\" referred to in the title of this bio may be viewed as multiple dichotomies: his native England versus Greece where he taught school on the island of Spetsai and which inspired \\"The Magus\\"; his lower middle-class upbringing versus Oxford schooling and high literary art crowd/academia that uneasily embraced him; his brushes with Hollywood versus the tiny Dorset seacoast town of Lyme Regis where _The French Lieutenant's Woman_ takes place and where he has lived most of his adult life; his faithful 37-year marriage to Elizabeth Christy versus the adulterous affair from which it sprang (she was unhappily married when they met) . . . and versus the many fantasy affairs of the mind he carried on with other women real and created.<br /><br />This biography is about as \\"authorized\\" as one can get: Warburton was allowed full access to Fowles's voluminous journals, dating from 1950 to the early 1990s and the letters of John and Elizabeth Fowles. Fowles also gave the biographer many interviews and encouraged the people who had known him throughout his life to speak freely. Yet it hardly reads as hagiography; this is also about as \\"warts-and-all\\" as an authorized bio by an admiring reader can get. The early struggle to write was hard; fame was a poisoned apple; and ill health and depression plagues the novelist's recent life. Fowles misremembers stories, colors up his past in memory, but readily admits to doing so when faced with contrary evidence. (In fact, the discerning Fowles reader will remember he says as much as the narrator of TFLW.) The author bravely put the worst of his past on the line for his biographer, and one can only admire the courage of the one and the fairness of the other.<br /><br />This is not a \\"critical literary\\" bio -- Warburton notes connections and influences, but rarely spends more than a few pages describing or dissecting the works; it's a story of a complex life. There are plenty of tidbits to please the longtime fan. In 1975 Fowles wanted Helen Mirren to play his French Lieutenant's Woman (what a Sarah she would have made!). As soon as his first book made him notable, he looked forward to attacking writers he thought overrated, such as Iris Murdoch, but was too polite to do so once he met her. Somewhere there's a 531-page manuscript of a thriller called _The Device_, aka _Somebody's Got To Do It_, that Fowles wrote right after TFLW. Elizabeth Fowles was not only a muse and inspiration for many of the classic female characters in his books, but also made critical editorial suggestions that made the stories so much stronger than they were.<br /><br />Although there is much to give the longtime Fowles fan pause (and of course much to illuminate this fascinating man and his work for the newcomer), Warburton has done a commendable job.iscerning Fowles reader will remember he says as much as the narrator of TFLW.)

His hero visits a number of brothels, with more and less satisfying results; falls in love with an unearthly beauty in Chile; witnesses at least one killing; trip-sits for a shipmate, then does a tab of acid himself; reads _Crime and Punishment_ and ponders his similarities and differences with Raskolnikov; identifies the soul buddies on board, as well as the baddies to stay clear of; and tries to learn the tricky job of making a \\"three star fix,\\" in which the sea navigator pinpoints his ship's exact location by sighting familiar stars along the celestial sphere.<br />Although there are many striking incidents and an occasional exquisite passage throughout this sexually frank but not explicit book, for my money the best chapter occurs in the middle of the story, when Jake visits an infamous whorehouse in Callao known as the Trockadero. Sharp details mingle with hallucinatory descriptions of events and emotions; it would have made a lovely short story by itself.<br />Jablonski's publisher, Gardenia Press of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has done a mixed job by its author. There are a fair number of typoes, although most of them are not of the leap-off-the-page-at-you variety. His editors seem to have had particular difficulty keeping an apostrophe out of the possessive \\"its,\\" and they've invariably allowed their word processing software to substitute an open quotation mark for an initial apostrophe (as in \\" 'Cuz\\" and \\"How 'bout you?\\"). Some of the more amusing ones included egg \\"yoke,\\" \\"Universite de Columbia,\\" and \\"a small steep trail -- not much more than a lama path. . . .\\" But the cover art is marvelous, and the book is well produced for a paperback.<br />Not being an experienced seaman (I crossed the Atlantic to Tangiers on a Yugoslav freighter once, but as a 10-year-old tourist passenger), I can't vouch for the accuracy of the descriptions of the crafts and trade, but I wouldn't doubt they are as on target as the rest of the book seems to be.<br />An admirable effort.

Mr. Atkinson writes beautifully, sensitively, and fairly about this huge, complex historical era.<br />The first of a projected three volumes about the U.S. role in the World War II liberation of Europe, _An Army at Dawn_ deals with the North Africa campaign, which many general readers have tended to neglect in favor of Italy, Normandy, and beyond. Atkinson admirably addresses this problem.<br />Somehow, the author has found just the right mix of detail -- from personal notes out of soldiers' diaries and letters home, to the reparations paid to Algerians for traffic fatalities caused by Allies -- versus big picture aspects, from the British and American political maneuverings at Casablanca to the larger troop movements and battle strategy. I got a kick out of the references to GI passwords in various battles, jokes and ditties (although it's not clear whether Atkinson realizes the couplet quoted on p. 526 is from Spike Jones's wartime hit, &quot;Der Fuehrer's Face&quot;), as well as the graver tales of of triumph and tragedy.<br />Don't let the size of this tome intimidate you (541 pages of text, 83 pages of notes, 28 pages of bibliographical source listings) -- because the book reads smoothly and compulsively. And there are plenty of excellent maps sprinkled throughout the book, at just the right places.<br />The author does not spare us the details of Allied political and personal squabbles (particularly British condescension toward American battleworthiness and courage -- not altogether undeserved, but not fair, either), absurdities, and atrocities.<br />Hard core historians may quibble with some of Atkinson's judgments, or even his facts, but I can't imagine anyone writing a more excellent account for the general reader. General Fredendall is said to be &quot;unencumbered by charisma.&quot; With excellent intelligence, Ike's team decided there would be no German offensive on the eve of Kasserine Pass, which was &quot;measured, reasonable, and wrong.&quot;<br />Don't take my word for it: Read those first two pages, and I guarantee you'll want to read this book (and await the other two volumes breathlessly) too.ve of Kasserine Pass, which was &quot;measured, reasonable, and wrong.&quot;<br />Don't take my word for it: Read those first two pages, and I guarantee you'll want to read this book (and await the other two volumes breathlessly) too.	2002-10-22

Brand, a history prof at Texas A&amp;M. Yet he has turned out a smooth and accessible work on the process and possible long-term effects of the California gold rush.<br />Brand manages a fine mix of the larger view -- statistics, maps of larger immigration movements, etc. -- with storylines of various specific characters, from the familiar (General William Sherman and John Fremont), to the vaguely familiar (Leland Stanford and the actual discoverer of gold at Sutter's Mill, James Marshall), to the unknown (fortune hunters and settlers who chronicled their trips across the western prairies as well as from Australia, France, and China). Although the Chinese experience still gets short shrift, Brand has chosen some terrific characters (and decent writers) from other foreign lands to tell their stories.<br />This book also makes very clear how hard a time most people had of it. Brand describes in detail the effort of crossing the raw continent, the many human and animal carcasses that fell by the wayside (or succumbed to violence), and the arduous physical process of extracting precious metals from the earth until industrialization took over that work too.<br />One of the more eye-opening sections for me was the description of how many fires -- big, devastating ones -- San Francisco suffered in the 1840s and 1850s.<br />In trying to make a case for the larger and long-term effects of the gold rush (impressive shifts of world population, the decline of the Native American west due largely to the railroads), Brand gets a little far afield from California's gold fields toward the end of the book, but the text is always interesting and very readable.	2002-08-28

This manuscript, which describes the Germany of his youth and the rise of Hitler, was written shortly after his escape, but filed away when the war broke out. His son discovered it only after Haffner's death in 1999 and it was a smash bestseller in Germany the following year.<br />The author describes what it was like for thoughtful, liberal Germans to see their country taken over by monsters, and explains how so many \\"ordinary\\" Germans could have failed to resist, and even participated. (I'd be curious to know whether the title is his; Haffner is very hard on his fellow Germans and himself, and it would not have surprised me, now that I've read the book, if he would have settled for something closer to \\"Succumbing to Hitler\\" or \\"Marching In Step.\\" There's precious little defying of Hitler in this account, as Haffner would be the first to admit.)<br />It starts slow by analyzing German politics and society after the First World War -- few readers aside from German history nuts will recognize names like Rathenau, Stresemann, and Bruening -- and I expected to have to give it three stars, despite the thoughtfulness and intelligence of the writing.<br />But try not to let that discourage you. When Haffner gets to the personal narrative about his Jewish friends and girlfriend, the changes in his Berlin society and neighborhood, and the grotesque \\"training camp\\" which he and other aspiring lawyers were forced to attend before being allowed to take their qualifying exam, the book becomes gripping. (And he takes a few pages to apologize and justify this very aspect!)<br />His description of the rationalizations, the delusions, the mutual suspicions and pressures on ordinary Germans -- even the intellectual elite -- is most illuminating. Haffner beautifully describes the poisoned pill of \\"comradeship,\\" which was imposed on the German populace at more or less every level, just as it is in any military organization or religious cult, and how Germans were, in his estimation, particularly susceptible to it.<br />The account ends rather abruptly, and one wonders what happened to some of the players, but there is quite enough here to offer something new indeed about the history of Nazi Germany ... from the inside, on the street.isoned pill of \\"comradeship,\\" which was imposed on the German populace at more or less every level, just as it is in any military organization or religious cult, and how Germans were, in his estimation, particularly susceptible to it.<br />The account ends rather abruptly, and one wonders what happened to some of the players, but there is quite enough here to offer something new indeed about the history of Nazi Germany ... from the inside, on the street.	2002-08-20
US	53074766	R1BREYTXPTUKGY	1893329143	461166110	21st Century Manzanar	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Surprisingly beguiling	I was not predisposed to like this book. My mother is Nisei and spent the war in the camps (and like the author, I had two uncles already serving in the U.S. Army when Pearl Harbor was attacked), but I'm ambivalent about dwelling on the experience, I don't think a similar internment will happen in this country again, and going in, the plot of this book seemed to offer a strong whiff of unseemly paranoia.<br />But it turns out, given the outrageous premise of fierce economic war between Japan and the U.S., resulting in the revival of Executive Order 9066, and a couple of unbelievable plot turns, that _21st Century Manzanar_ is a surprisingly engaging book. The plot and style shift easily between lyrical reminiscence, action thriller, character studies, and even the somewhat surreal (both drug- and faith-induced).<br />When the story opens, David Takeda, a Sansei (third generation Japanese-American) in his late 40s from the Venice Beach area, has been reduced to earning his living by delivering eulogies for deceased relations and friends -- their numbers cut down by disease and racist violence. His brother Johnny is beaten to death before they get to Manzanar, in the desert of eastern California, but sister Kate and her children make it to camp. The bulk of the book recreates camp life and the characters' hopes for escape.<br />Though there is naturally much Japanese-American content (even a 6-page glossary of Japanese and slang terms in the back), this is a highly multicultural novel. David's best friends are a black man and a Hispanic lesbian; also, Miyake significantly plays up the similarities in physiognomy, behavior, and values between Japanese and Southwest Native Americans. In camp one gets to know an alleged half Chinese, half Korean character -- a gay man named Bradley Kuwata, who serves as both a clown and an eventual saviour.<br />The villains of the story -- particularly a Nurse Ratched-like camp director and a recurring soldier-guard figure -- are a little too unidimensional and caricatured (but this IS a satire), however the \\"good guys\\" are complex, ambivalent, and given to fatal changes of mind ... and their body count jarringly high.<br />Even more surprising, Miyake mixes a fair amount of the lyrical with the profane. This book is not only a love letter to Japanese-Americans (the author reportedly included much of his own family's biographical details in the background of his hero), but also to Los Angeles. There's a strong sense of place in the opening chapters, and Miyake names names and recreates businesses that actually existed and he remembers fondly.<br />Obviously, anyone with a Japanese background will easily slip into the milieu of this story, but I think even gaijin may find it worthwhile, for its grittiness, detail, and odd shifts of style and perspective.le too unidimensional and caricatured (but this IS a satire), however the \\"good guys\\" are complex, ambivalent, and given to fatal changes of mind ... and their body count jarringly high.<br />Even more surprising, Miyake mixes a fair amount of the lyrical with the profane.

Though this elevates his position considerably, it also places him amidst castle intrigues that constantly endanger his position -- even his life -- from both above and below.<br />He survives attempted poisonings, the plague, and household intrigues; learns from his daughter how to write; and eventually writes his fantastic tale, which includes highly memorable meals, sex, and several brushes with death. The action and humor are often quite earthy and bawdy. Although the style is mostly picaresque (as well as part fairy tale and part Monty Python), there are also genuine moments of threat, tenderness, and lightly philosophical musings appropriate to the narrator's time and station.<br />\\"I asked God if perhaps He had not mistaken us for someone else,\\" he remarks early on. Much later, Ugo says, \\"The more I thought about this, the more it seemed what people thought were God's mysteries were really mistakes.\\" As his daughter Miranda's fortunes begin to climb above his own, Ugo laments, \\"I wanted to cross the room to her bedside and hold her in my arms and tell her that I would always care for her, but the way had become so crowded with our ambition that I could not get through.\\"<br />\\"Translated\\" by actor and writer Peter Elbling (whose credits include the screenplay for \\"Honey I Blew Up the Kids\\"), this rollicking tale was understandably an international bestseller before making it back to our shores.	2002-07-16

In 1979 he bought a 24-foot New England catboat, built on Cape Cod in 1910, and proceeded to fix it and sail it around the New York area.<br />With this book he presents a portrait -- and sketchy history -- of the city from an angle few people know it. Structuring the story as a fairly continuous though interrupted sail from his home in Long Beach, around the southern tip of Rockaway and into Jamaica Bay, then into Upper New York Bay and the East River, and ultimately to Long Island Sound, Kornblum offers both close-up looks at the water and shoreline, and their past history.<br />The approach is light and pleasant: Few stories -- whether of the freezing disaster of the privateer \\"Castel Del Rey\\" in New York harbor in 1704, knowledgeable black sailors impressed by the British Navy in the War of 1812 and jailed in England for refusing to serve against the US, various ferry disasters, or the vagaries of Robert Moses -- last more than a page or three. The only sections where Kornblum lingers are in Jamaica Bay (its environmental degradation and return), and the dockside concrete industry that built New York's towers and for which the author worked as a kid. Manhattan itself is quickly bypassed though given a loving nod, and there is no venturing into the Hudson side.<br />In the typo sweepstakes, the book does all right, although it says \\"mechanical break\\" on p. 156 when \\"brake\\" was meant, and I believe I saw an unintended sentence fragment on p. 143. Most egregious, the great A.J. Liebling is identified on p. 103 as \\"Libeling\\" (though the name is correct in the bibliography)! A pity there apparently are youthful editors (I don't suppose there is such a thing as a proofreader in publishing anymore) who do not know this great journalist's work backward and forward.<br />Another ominous development -- to this reader, anyway -- is that the lovely cover photograph is an unreal composite. Different photographers are credited for different portions of it. I find this vaguely disturbing.<br />The writing is definitely four-star quality or better. Here's my favorite passage: \\"Up another shadowy bend stood two snowy egrets, with their outrageous yellow boots and platinum punk haircuts. How chic, these mudbank sushi bars. The egrets were spearing for sand bugs, moving along the edge of the marsh with the herky giant steps of students at a party stepping over empty beer cans.\\"<br />I give the book only three stars because it is slight. Probably an excellent gift for the average non-reader who happens to love sailing or New York City, or the casual reader who knows little about either, but I would have liked to know more.the lovely cover photograph is an unreal composite.

It was entirely fitting that a dual bio be attempted, and Galbraith is to be applauded for taking on the job and making good work of it.<br /><br />Though _The Emperor and the Wolf_ looks intimidatingly thick, only 650 of its 825 pages are actual narrative (the rest is taken up by an impressively detailed filmography of the two principals which scholars will love, and extensive notes and index), and that narrative reads easily and fairly swiftly.<br /><br />The emphasis is clearly on the FILMS rather than the lives of these extraordinary artists. Galbraith moves calmly over such developments as Kurosawa's 1971 suicide attempt and Mifune's mistress Mika Kitagawa. He doesn't avoid, but he doesn't dwell, either.<br /><br />On the other hand, assuming the Western reader's basic ignorance of such matters (and rightly so), he takes care to summarize the work of other directors, writers, and actors whenever they crossed paths with our two heroes. Descriptions of even really bad and forgettable films that have never made it to the U.S. sometimes make one yearn to see them, never mind the many decent ones.<br /><br />There are plenty of quotes from American film reviewers -- good, bad, and ugly. (I was surprised that among my favorites, Stanley Kauffmann missed the boat a few times, and John Simon utterly dismissed \\"Ran.\\") Kevin Thomas of the LA Times seems to have done the best, most consistent job of grasping what these two geniuses were doing, each time a new film came out.<br /><br />Galbraith gets overly defensive about Kurosawa's final two projects, \\"Rhapsody in August\\" and \\"Madadayo,\\" but is harsh with \\"Dreams\\" and doesn't hesitate to disagree with famed Japan and Japanese film expert Donald Richie on some judgments, or to point out where other commentators have missed the boat (such as in the role William Holden played in championing Japanese films -- in particular, Inagaki's \\"Samurai\\" -- in the United States).<br /><br />He's not a great prose stylist -- he regularly treats \\"none\\" and \\"each\\" as plural nouns, as in \\"none ... have been,\\" \\"each ... have been\\" -- and I scratched my head over the conclusion \\"as lightweight films go, it is something of a masterpiece\\" (of \\"Sanjuro,\\" p. 331), as well as the meaningless \\"infinitely more transcendent\\" (p. 558).<br /><br />The book includes 44 b&w photos. Most are merely okay (perhaps Richie got most of the great ones for his books), although the one of Mifune in full costume driving off the set of \\"Yojimbo\\" in his MG is priceless.<br /><br />One comes away from this largely reverent book with increased respect for both its subjects (yes, that is possible!), particularly the actor, about whose modesty and professionalism there are endless testimonials.<br /><br />Even as a world famous star and head of his own production studio in his 40s, Mifune would clean bathrooms and ashtrays, spray the sidewalk, fetch chairs for others. He always knew his lines, and was unfailingly kind to new, young actors. Because he acted as his own agent, he rarely received top dollar for his work, which usually meant greater gate receipts for even truly bad films after the mid 1950s.<br /><br />I snapped this book up as soon as I ran across it, just over a week ago, and I'm glad I did.role William Holden played in championing Japanese films -- in particular, Inagaki's \\"Samurai\\" -- in the United States).

The word itself debuted in 1806, and &quot;bartender&quot; arrived on the scene in 1836.<br />He relates delightful tales of illustrious mixers and saloons, as well as the history -- as best it can be divined -- of specific drinks from the Manhattan and the daiquiri to many lost and unlamented experiments such as the Lightning Smash, the Alabama Fog-Cutter, and the Free Silver Fizz.<br />Apart from anecdotes about Dickens and Washington Irving sharing a mint julep in Baltimore (1842), or the fact that Sherwood Anderson died of peritonitis brought on by the swallowing of a martini olive toothpick, Grimes's colonial pre-history of the cocktail is perhaps the most interesting part of the book. He also notes the evolution of today's standards: for example, Rangoon Ruby to Bog Fog to Cape Codder.<br />The text is garnished with passages from Bunuel, Ben Franklin, Dreiser, Twain, Hawthorne, O'Hara, and of course Hemingway. (Fitzgerald's Turkey Cocktail will make you laugh out loud.)<br />The reason I give this lovely book only 3 stars is that it's so short. There's but 126 pages of text, plus about 36 pages of cocktail recipes. That's a drawback for a stout and heavy reader like myself, but it might make this book the perfect gift for the person who does not read a lot beyond the Wall Street Journal and Forbes -- someone who truly does appreciate the cocktail in this age of Chardonnay nuts and tae bo, and might be most inclined to experiment with the 103 recommended recipes in the back.	2002-01-02

Too many conclusions these days fail to deliver on their promise. This one succeeds.<br />Viktor, a lonely journalist nearing 40, lives in Kiev with an Emperor penguin he adopted a year ago when the zoo gave up many of the animals it could no longer afford to feed. Misha, the penguin, lives a quiet, subdued life consisting of little more than a steady diet of fish and cold baths.<br />Happily, a newspaper hires Viktor to write advance obituaries: summings-up of notable persons' lives to be kept on file for the day the subject dies. It's steady work for decent pay. The editor even encourages Viktor to stretch out the pieces with a little literary-philosophical content.<br />One day, a sinister but friendly visitor passes along his own obit assignments for very good money. When Viktor complains about having composed more than a hundred obits but having nothing published, the visitor asks which Viktor thinks is his best piece ... and within a day, the subject is dead! Complications and further deaths ensue.<br />More assignments come from the mobster (&quot;Misha-not-penguin&quot;), who then leaves his young daughter with Viktor &quot;for a short time,&quot; but never returns. Little Sonya comes with a big packet of money, so Viktor is able to hire 20-year-old Nina as a day nanny for her. Soon, this quasi-family is settled in for the long haul -- with their penguin -- except that more and more of Viktor's obituary subjects get killed!<br />_Death and the Penguin_ is written in a dry, simple style. The chapters are short, the narrative rarely embellished. Though there is plenty of humor, it is not laugh-out-loud but of the wry-smile-to-oneself variety.<br />This is not magic realism, but straight realistic narrative of people (and penguin) behaving quite plausibly under increasingly-odd circumstances. It's a queerly unsensational story that seems perversely matter-of-fact, but accelerates into a sudden and very satisfying climax.tter-of-fact, but accelerates into a sudden and very satisfying climax.	2001-12-13

Thousands were massacred after battles as well as during them; several of the Guy Fawkes gunpowder plotters had their hearts cut out while still alive.<br />Two years after his death and embalming, Cromwell's body was exhumed and publicly hanged. And not just humans suffered: When yet another wave of the plague struck London in 1665, and dog and cats were believed to be the cause, 40,000 dogs and perhaps 200,000 cats were slaughtered. The slave trade and the brutal labor conditions on a West Indian sugar plantation are vividly depicted.<br />(Bracing though all of this may be, it's encouraging to realize that such atrocities have ceased to occur within the UK in the past century and a half, just as it seems unlikely the Germans and French will ever again be at each other's throats, so maybe the species is making slow but inexorable progress toward the light. And what great movies all this history would make, and in some cases HAS made!)<br />Though the life of common folk gets somewhat short shrift, Schama does note significant developments along the way: the arrival of condoms, the growth of print news media, English society as seen through the eyes of a slave named Olaudah Equiano.<br />It is helpful to be reminded that while we Yanks tend to think of the &quot;French and Indian War&quot; as a quaint prelude to our Revolution (whose launching is stirringly related by Schama, who though a born Brit, spent a few years in Boston and now teaches at Columbia), the Seven Years War was actually a sort of &quot;world war&quot; between England and France for future dominance of the globe: battles took place in the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, even West Africa and India, while Major George Washington was dashing about New England under Braddock's command.<br />Volume 2 regrettably has fewer maps than Volume 1 -- I would have appreciated a little more topographical help with the mid 17th century civil wars and Scottish campaigns -- and it also shows a few signs of having been rushed to print (e.g., &quot;perpeptuated&quot; on p. 99).<br />But Schama's smooth and engaging narrative style makes a fine introduction to English history for the less knowledgeable general reader. (For example, he wishes Jane Austen had been around to chronicle the vicious personal politics of India's administrators, and drily notes the repeated automatic lies that filled British propaganda about its enemies, decade after decade: &quot;impaled babies, eviscerated pregnant mothers, roughed-up grandpas -- the usual thing....&quot;)<br />I look forward with eagerness to the next volume in the series.e &quot;French and Indian War&quot; as a quaint prelude to our Revolution (whose launching is stirringly related by Schama, who though a born Brit, spent a few years in Boston and now teaches at Columbia), the Seven Years War was actually a sort of &quot;world war&quot; between England and France for future dominance of the globe: battles took place in the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, even West Africa and India, while Major George Washington was dashing about New England under Braddock's command.<br />Volume 2 regrettably has fewer maps than Volume 1 -- I would have appreciated a little more topographical help with the mid 17th century civil wars and Scottish campaigns -- and it also shows a few signs of having been rushed to print (e.g., &quot;perpeptuated&quot; on p. 99).<br />But Schama's smooth and engaging narrative style makes a fine introduction to English history for the less knowledgeable general reader.

The authors profile dogs around the world who do vital, entertaining, helpful, and sometimes life-saving work.<br />Although there are some familiar types in this bunch -- a retired racing greyhound, a top sheep-herding champion, a prize-winning show dog, a veteran Iditarod race sled dog, a canine actor (malamute-timberwolf mix), a police dog, and a German shepherd who hunts for injured people in disaster areas -- you will encounter some canines who accomplish tasks you could not have imagined.<br />Snooper is a female beagle who can out-perform any humans and their machinery in detecting termites in people's Florida dream homes. A Newfoundland named Mas rescues boats and people at sea of the east coast of Italy, even leaping out of a helicopter to get to them. Yanka and King are a pair of German shepherds who perform the dangerous work of sniffing out land mines in Bosnia. A black Lab named Star is an arson investigator in England who can detect 10 different hydrocarbon accelerants in the wreckage of a fire.<br />A yellow lab named Endal performs about 90 different tasks for his paraplegic Gulf War veteran friend, from opening doors and cupboards and turning on lights to taking a wallet and a note up to the cash register to &quot;make a purchase&quot; at non disabled-accessible businesses. A golden retriever can forecast his owner's epileptic seizures. Tammy, a Border collie, catches smugglers of endangered abalone in South Africa and has her own bodyguard -- a German shepherd who's a veteran police attack dog -- because criminals have made death threats against her.<br />The book is simply written, as if for high schoolers or middle schoolers. Also, the schematic structure of the chapters -- start in the middle of a dramatic moment, leave the action hanging to sketch in the background, return to the climax -- is a little obvious. But color portraits of every pooch and many more black-and-white shots, and the charm and wonder of the tales, make up for these shortcomings.ut color portraits of every pooch and many more black-and-white shots, and the charm and wonder of the tales, make up for these shortcomings.	2001-03-02

Sartre saw no action during this period (he was in his early 30s), but he WAS in military service on the front during the &quot;phony war.&quot; Mostly, he had a lot of time to think and write.<br />Sartre worked on some of the foundations for _Being and Nothingness_ and existential theory in general, so there's some of that here, but this is a marvelously HUMAN document. As well as the sort of intellectual blasts one expects from him (Flaubert's _A Sentimental Education_ is deemed to be &quot;clumsy, disagreeable ... utterly idiotic&quot;), Sartre writes of his insecurities (&quot;In relation to Gauguin, Van Gogh and Rimbaud, I have a distinct inferiority complex because they managed to destroy themselves&quot;; &quot;It's true, I'm not authentic. With everything that I feel, before actually feeling it I know that I'm feeling it ... I fool people: I look like a sensitive person but I'm barren ... I am nothing but pride and lucidity&quot;).<br />There's a lot about his love of women and burning desire for beauty -- to be IN something beautiful; and his total failure at friendships with men, save for what he termed women-men (&quot;an extremely rare species, standing out from the rest thanks to their physical charm or sometimes beauty, and to a host of inner riches which the common run of men know nothing of ... I'm a woman-man myself, I think, for all my ugliness&quot;).<br />Sometimes he is flip, sounding more like he's trying out aphorisms for size (&quot;I would condemn someone definitively for a linguistic mannerism, but not because I'd seen him murder his mother&quot;), and sometimes simple and sincere (&quot;A day begun with a breakfast is a lucky day&quot;). Above all, he broods on the nature of freedom and authenticity. This is a much more accessible work than much of his fiction or polished essays.	2001-02-07

It's more a thoughtful, philosophical look -- in small, bite-size bits -- at the relationships between dogs and humans, and what humans have made of dogs in their writings.<br />The &quot;chapters&quot; are more like Pascalian pensees: mostly two to three pages, but sometimes as short as one paragraph. They discuss everything from dogs in dreams and famous literary non-appreciators of dogs, to ghastly historical incidents such as the rounding up and exile to an island of thousands of dogs so that they starved and ate one another, by the Turks in 1910.<br />Grenier recalls many writers' real and authorial canine doings, but the accent is on French writers (the author has been an editor for the distinguished French press Gallimard), so unless the names Larbaud, Queneau, Mauriac, Valery, Chateaubriand, or Romain Gary mean a lot, you are apt to feel like a stranger at the cocktail party. It can come as a relief when Grenier returns to the concrete and relates incidents with his own dog, Ulysses.<br />(Faulker, Turgenev, Jack London and Kundera also turn up, although Grenier discusses Descartes's dismissal of animal souls and subsequent writers' response yet never mentions Kundera's lengthy discussion of the topic in _The Unbearable Lightness of Being_. The description of a Virginia Woolf novel narrated by a dog, _Flush_, sounds fascinating, though; how come I've never heard of this book?)<br />Elegant, erudite, but perhaps a little too heady for the American reader.	2001-01-12

Henrietta made faster friends with his wife Jaquelin, daughter Celia, and son Chris, and together they insisted she travel with them to Wren's postings in Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, Ottawa, and Johannesburg.<br />Naturally there are wonderful adventures with Andrei Sakharov, diplomats, and other journalists, as well as near-death experiences and disappearances. Wren lightly describes the lore of cats in the various countries they visited, a touch of feline physiology and psychology when useful, and the more practical concerns of how to feed a kitty and procure her litter in faraway, isolated lands. This charming book is enhanced by a handful of ink and watercolor illustrations in a Chinese style by Meilo So, and would make a perfect gift for any cat lover.<br />Unfortunately, this book is yet another victim of publisher slovenliness and neglect: I found a taxi &quot;weaving through Rome's narrow seats&quot; (72), &quot;an smiling vendor&quot; (95), &quot;other more more obscure meanings&quot; (143), and &quot;...we spared the cat the seventeen-hour flight back to Beijing and by leaving her with the young schoolteacher....&quot; (150). The text also seems confused about whether Henrietta got lost in Cairo &quot;more than a month&quot; (86) or &quot;nearly a month&quot; (88). One cannot but regard this as yet another sign of contempt on the part of the publishing world for readers, books, and the poor author, but one can do nothing about it but complain.	2001-01-03

Gould, a Down East Yankee and columnist for the Christian Science Monitor since 1942, offers a collection of short commentaries from an assisted living center. The book isn't simply a humorous indictment of the foibles and peculiarities of life in a retirement home (though there is plenty of that, from comments about food to the saga of the unopenable window and the familiar refrain &quot;There is nothing to be done about it&quot;). The author ranges across all his 92 years to draw on memories of doctors, raising bees with his Grandfather, and the perfect tomato.<br />This is a great book for reading out loud, my wife and I found -- the sentences tend to be short and simple, belying the emotional nuances and complexity of the thoughts underneath. The author is not a simple, genteel sort, despite the appearance of his prose. There are passages on the joys of farting humor, reproductions of the light verse with which he lampooned the failures of the management (these never survived more than three minutes on the bulletin board because they &quot;offended the staff&quot;), and a truly fierce (but nevertheless funny) indictment of the insurance industry.<br />Think of this book as Robert Fulghum in a retirement home and you'll be close to it.	2000-12-29

Gathering suggestive evidence from a  variety of disciplines, from  ceramics and linguistics to medical/genetic,  she has taken 40 years to bring it all together in this book, so one could  hardly accuse her of rushing to publish!<br />Her thesis is that Japanese  immigrants -- perhaps Buddhist priests, perhaps peasants fleeing  persecution or seeking a better life -- crossed the Pacific and made their  way to the Southwest interior by the late 13th century, to merge with the  locals (Anasazi?) and give rise to the Zuni.  Her evidence is all  circumstantial, but quite suggestive, perhaps even persuasive.<br />Other  reviewers have mentioned the Japanese chrysanthemum and Zuni sacred  rosette, artwork, and kidney disease. Zuni creation myths, with their  stories of ancestors coming from the west to escape earthquakes and find  the middle of the earth, are tantalizing. There are considerable  similarities between Japanese syntax and words, and Zuni, for which  linguists have been able to find no other relations. The Type B blood  allele tends to be absent in all other Native American tribes, high in  Asians (20-40 percent), low in Caucasians (0-15 percent) -- but between  10-32 percent of Japanese carry it, and about 10 percent of Zuni.<br />There  are many other disciplines into which Yaw Davis dips and finds  commonalities between Japanese and Zuni: folk practices for training  children, archeological deposits off the coast of California containing  ancient iron spikes and huge, heavy, Chinese-style stone  &quot;doughnut&quot; anchors, Asian coins woven into Tlingit armor. I was  particularly intrigued by the fact that lead glazed pottery, found nowhere  else in the Southwest but common in Asia, turns up among the Zuni in the  late 13th century, but deteriorates and disappears soon after, which  implies a sudden introduction that didn't last.<br />The book is easily  readable -- sometimes TOO casually written (what does it mean to say that,  after inventing language, humans &quot;literally took off&quot;?) -- and  has plenty of maps and photos.  Yaw Davis could have organized her case  better, and restated her thesis and its strongest evidence at the end  instead of cutting the book short rather abruptly.<br />But the case is  compelling, and one looks forward to the specialists in various other  fields putting her theory to the test.er, which  implies a sudden introduction that didn't last.<br />The book is easily  readable -- sometimes TOO casually written (what does it mean to say that,  after inventing language, humans &quot;literally took off&quot;?) -- and  has plenty of maps and photos.

The fact is, Dr. Lewis's book is neither as  great nor as bad as many of them make out.<br />Yes, she does speak as a  feeling person as much as a professional, and yes, she sometimes makes  herself seem far more naive than I suspect she must have been. Also, of  necessity the book parades a rogues gallery of killers -- male and female  -- and their gruesome crimes before us.<br />On the one hand, this is not a  scientific paper, it is a popular book for the lay reader. And  nevertheless, Dr. Lewis has several very important points to make. Most and  perhaps all of the death row inmates she has studied not only came from  horrid socioeconomic and psychological backgrounds, but they appear to have  suffered brain damage before birth, at birth, or in accidents or due to  abuse since. Some appeared to suffer genuine seizures and mental blackouts;  others, much as Dr. Lewis's training and inclination led her to resist the  notion, genuinely appeared to have multiple personalities. Her conversion  on this point by flesh-and-blood evidence is an instructive  process.<br />These facts raise interesting questions about criminal  responsibility and culpability, ones the legal system is not anywhere near  prepared to acknowledge and weigh in its decisions. The conclusion is not  that society should free these damaged souls, but perhaps that the nature  of their punishment and treatment could be better informed. Dr. Lewis  voices strong if not terribly coherent criticisms of these failings.<br />So I  found the book engrossing and thought-provoking. Unfortunately, my  hardbound copy suffers from the growing plague in contemporary books of  computer spell-check-dependent typos. There are references to &quot;grizzly  murder&quot; (112) and &quot;grizzliest murders&quot; (258 -- though the  adjective is spelled correctly on page 284), and to a fetus's navel  &quot;chord&quot; (264). Most unfortunate for a Jewish author, one reads of  &quot;a minion of Hassidim (142 -- the word is &quot;minyan,&quot;  editors!), and even worse for a doctor, we find the sentence: &quot;A death  row psychiatrist's allegiance is torn between Hypocrites and the  state&quot; (187). Hypocritic Oath, anyone?<br />Despite these minor  irritations, this is a useful and readable book.(264).

She's cute, she's fun, she's fairly sharp, and her heart's in the right place.<br />It's hard to recall that once upon a time Bright was a sexual radical: Look, she's the lesbian co-founder of the  in-your-face, pro-pornography sex magazine, &quot;On Our Backs&quot;! No,  wait, she's bisexual! Say, isn't that her editing annual collections of  erotica? Omigod, she's relating a sex fantasy about Dan Quayle! Today, with  a steady male partner (in an open relationship) and a daughter about to  enter her teens, Bright comes across almost matronly.<br />It takes an essay  like the one in this book about a bomb threat called in before one of her  lectures to remind her of what's at stake and inspire some thoughtful  writing, and to remind us all that large portions of the country still find  someone like Susie Bright a threat.<br />Unfortunately, with most of this book  she's largely treading water. As other reviewers have noted, she seems to  have said most of what she has to say. And at 163 pages, this volume comes  in a little slim at the price. Newcomers to her may enjoy _Full Exposure_,  but for harder, faster Susie, I'd go for _Susie Sexpert's Lesbian Sex  World_ or _The Sexual State of the Union_.<br />And after that, head for the  even spicier pastures of Pat Califia's _Public Sex_.	2000-08-01

I think the one  time I really connected emotionally with them -- at least in my mind -- was  when an acid trip kept me up all night in the Oregon high desert and,  walking down a dusty road at dawn, I noticed small creatures scurry out of  my way and felt their stinging reproach: Your species has already overrun  the planet, they seemed to say to me; can't you let us have this one quiet  time of the day to ourselves?<br />Robin Eschner, a California artist, has  executed woodcut prints to accompany an essay by nature writer Barry Lopez  regarding his thoughts and actions in response to ... road killed  animals.<br />If you've never read Lopez's wonderful nature writing, travel  essays, or fiction, get moving! This book might not be such a good  introduction, despite the author's customary elegant, rich but ever-precise  prose. (For a fine and easily digested survey of his work, try the recent  collection _About This Life: Journeys on the Threshold of Memory_, and for  Lopez full out and leisurely, go for _Arctic Dreams_.)<br />The subject matter  of _Apologia_ is perhaps a bit in-your-face, though Eschner's tasteful and  evocative artwork never is. The pictures cast long, stark shadows, but are  never creepy, disgusting, or manipulative.<br />If you have a strong feeling  for animals, at least some ambivalence about the domination of the American  landscape by the combustion-engine carriage, and the price the former pay  for unsought violent encounters with the latter -- or if you know someone  who feels that way -- this thin, coffee-table-style volume would be a  lovely and appropriate purchase.<br />And if you ever get the chance to see  Lopez speak or read from his work, GO! He is a truly sensitive and moral  man, and a magnificent writer.	2000-06-12

We learn  more about Harry's parents and their death, and more loose ends of history  get tied.  New characters turn up, from the sickly but kind  teacher of  Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor Lupin, to yet another  picture-guard, Sir Cadogan.  A werewolf, a magical map, and an amazing  hourglass turn up in the plot, as well as a winged creature called a  hippogriff.<br />J.K. Rowling is to be commended for maintaining a fairly  consistent level of quality throughout the Potter books thus far.  By  comparison, this one has less gross-out humor and a bit more Darkness and  mystery.<br />Some sloppiness is evident, however.  The dialogue gets a bit  melodramatically extreme in the &quot;revelation of the past&quot; chapter  17 when our heroes, Snape, Lupin, Black and several animals confront one  another; and at the end of chapter 18 Madame Pomfrey suddenly pops up in an  old story where she has no apparent place to be.  Perhaps this reflects a  slip-up in revision and editing.  On page 272, Mrs. Weasley briefly appears  as &quot;Mrs. Wealsey.&quot;<br />Nonetheless, the Missus and I hugely enjoyed  reading this one aloud to each other, and look forward to book four in a  few short months.	2000-05-16

Indianapolis	Books	3	11	11	N	N	Compelling story of a ghastly wartime incident	On July 30, 1945, four days after the USS Indianapolis delivered the first operational atomic bomb to the island of Tinian (and exactly a week before that bomb would be dropped on Hiroshima), the unescorted heavy cruiser was torpedoed on its way to the Philippines by a Japanese submarine. The Navy  never noticed that the ship did not reach its destination; 300 sailors went  down with the ship, and 900 others floundered in the water for four days --  starving, drowning, and attacked by sharks, before being accidentally  spotted by a passing bomber. Only 316 members of the original 1,196-man  crew survived.<br />Several books have been published about the hapless ship,  and how the Navy courtmartialed and blamed its captain so that he died a  broken and alcoholic man.  This is the only one I have read, so I don't  know how it compares, but it's competently written and the tale is  irresistable.<br />Some of the images make indelible imprints on the mind:  &quot;The doctor [Lt. Cmdr. Lewis Leavitt Haynes] continued to pronounce  men dead.  He would remove their jackets, recite the Lord's Prayer, and  release the bodies.  The water was very clear, and Doctor Haynes remembered  the bodies looking like small dolls sinking in the deep sea.  He watched  them until they faded from sight.&quot;<br />A fine web site, lists information about the ship, its fate, a survivor's story, and current attempts to pass legislation that  would clear the captain, the late Charles Butler McVay III, of his  scapegoat conviction.	2000-05-15

For one thing, it's not nicely rounded; it doesn't tell a complete story, but provides a  blistering snapshot of a small slice of history and an investigation still  in process.  For another, its photos and text don't work closely together,  but provide approximately parallel looks into the same awful tale.  Hardest  of all is the stunning vividness of the photography by Gilles Peress, and  the nagging suspicion that we share some small portion of blame for  this.<br />Simply put, _The Graves_ is a collection of photographs of dead  bodies and skeletons, the anonymous mass graves from which they were  exhumed, the remnants of their clothing and contents of their pockets, the  relatives that survived them; and a text that describes the painstaking and  horrifying process of trying to identify them and divine how they came to  die.<br />Srebenica and Vukovar are two towns in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina,  where in July of 1995, hundreds of Muslim men -- unarmed, defenseless, and  bound -- were apparently shot by soldiers of the Serbian army under Ratko  Mladic and then bulldozed under mounds of earth.<br />Five years later, most  of those responsible still roam freely in the former Yugoslavia, though the  International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague steadily sifts evidence and  issues warrants for their arrest.  This book depicts some of the effort to  establish evidence of their guilt ... and is itself damning evidence.<br />The  photos by Peress, all black and white, are horridly beautiful in their  mute, pinpoint clarity.  They record a creepy new form of archaeology,  where shiny white teeth peek out of the dirt, leg bones remain encased in  socks and athletic shoes, entire bodies rise out of the near past, shorn of  flesh but still comfortably clothed.  They could be ancient remains, and  one struggles to comprehend that they were alive, page after page of them,  not very long ago.<br />Stover's text gives some historical context for these  graphic images, records the testimony of surviving witnesses, and offers  brief portraits of the men and women -- forensic pathologists,  archaeologists, x-ray technicians -- who sift through this grisly treasure.  Peress also photographs them at work, relaxing with a guitar, and the  waiting, anxious families with their charity canned goods and stuffed  toys.<br />This is a stark, stolid book, one that serves as a necessary  reminder that what happens on the other side of the planet matters, and  that no matter how much relative attention we give them, some things are  worse than being sent back to Cuba to live with one's father.  Much worse.me historical context for these  graphic images, records the testimony of surviving witnesses, and offers  brief portraits of the men and women -- forensic pathologists,  archaeologists, x-ray technicians -- who sift through this grisly treasure.

I believe they have overvalued it because of what the author has undergone, because he's written other, more stunning books, and because Wiesel is almost a monument in himself.<br />Having heard of his  Holocaust speeches and read his famous early concentration camp account,  _Night_, I was unprepared for the naivete and gentle self-mockery that  pervade this book.  Yes, it talks about his roots, his tussles with  religion, his adventures and misadventures as a journalist and  friend/antagonist of the great.<br />But what a surprise to see his repeated  references to all the pretty faces that caught his eye and how badly he  usually fared in approaching them: &quot;I indulged in some serious  flirting, by which I mean that I talked to them of things too serious to  achieve the desired result.&quot; &quot;I thought about all the girls in  Versailles and all the unknown women in trains who didn't know how much I  loved them, and about all the sins I lacked the courage to commit.&quot;  &quot;I knew if I lowered my guard I would be hit by one of those  thunderbolts I never knew how to handle. So of course I lowered my  guard.&quot; &quot;I spoke to her of destiny, and of Dante for good  measure. She told me not to be a fool.&quot;<br />It may strike some readers  almost as monotonous, but I found Wiesel's willingness to speak of things  all men experience, yet never include in their autobiographies, refreshing.  The other reviews stress the IMPORTANCE, almost PONDEROUSNESS, of  this book, yet that's not what I'm left with at all.  Wiesel is also  amazingly open and childlike. For instance, recovering from injuries  suffered in a massive car accident, he writes:<br />&quot;Confined to bed and  condemned to immobility, one dreams, one thinks about and sees the world in  a whole new way. A simple painkiller is worth more than a dozen wondrous  poems. I was more grateful to the nurse who came to turn me onto my back or  stomach than I would have been to the most ravishing of creatures granting  me her all. The most astonishing world news affected me less than the  doctor's smile.&quot;<br />This book shows the very human side of a  &quot;mere&quot; journalist who in his time has become almost an  institution.came to turn me onto my back or  stomach than I would have been to the most ravishing of creatures granting  me her all.

My grandmother, who lived in Alaska and Oregon, gave me a copy of this book when I was about 8, many decades ago.  I have never forgotten it and have been delighted to find another copy of late.<br />An  Indian boy, landlocked in central Canada, carves of wood a small Indian man  in a canoe, and places him on a snowy hillside, with a message on the  bottom of his canoe identifying him as &quot;Paddle-To-The-Sea&quot; and  pleading with anyone who finds him to put him back in the water so he can  complete his long journey -- a journey the boy cannot make himself.<br />At  the spring thaw, the wooden canoe slides down the mountain and into  streams, ponds, and eventually the Great Lakes and the St Lawrence River.  Paddle encounters boats, animals, ships' locks, a forest fire, a sawmill,  and many other threats and adventures.  Many pairs of hands discover and  help him along his mighty journey.  One even repaints him after a year or  more of bad weathering.<br />Each chapter-page of the book has a facing  full-page painting in rich colors, as well as small marginal illustrations.  The book is a great adventure story, but it's also an effective geography  lesson for folks who don't live in or know that part of the country.

What a loss to society and the English language!<br />As a film critic, he was  not in a class with, say, Stanley Kauffmann for discussion of film quality  and technique, or John Simon for bitchiness, but Crisp was a lovely English  stylist, and his unique point of view made him a delightful companion at  the movies.<br />Even if you don't agree with his judgments, they are a hoot  to read.  This book has a sunny quality that contrasts with the acrid humor  of his autobio, _The Naked Civil Servant_.  While you might visualize him  telling you that story over a stiff drink in a dark corner, the tone of  this book is more like a breezy meeting at a teahouse.<br />Of Cher, he  writes, &quot;She is tall and rangy and so lean that you fear that her  collarbone will saw its way through her hazardously thin shoulder  straps.&quot; Since &quot;the French appear to think that they invented  flirtation ... Their films on this subject are almost always pervaded by a  cloying quality of self-congratulation.&quot;  Of &quot;My Dinner With  Andre,&quot; he says, &quot;I could not bring myself to make a report on it  because it was as boring as being alive.&quot;  Mr. Depardieu is &quot;the  European equivalent of Mr. Nolte, though he lacks the golden skin tone, as  of a basted chicken, which adds so greatly to the allure of the American  star.&quot;<br />Most of the pieces in this collection were written for a  column in Christopher Street magazine, and the audience for that  publication must be kept in mind with regard to some of his film choices --  and as Crisp, well into his 70s and 80s at the time, makes remarks such as  &quot;sex is a mistake&quot; and &quot;homosexual men are pathologically  incapable of making love with their friends or making friends of their  lovers....&quot;<br />Call this a lightweight junket.

I didn't get it.  I tried to read her famous diary, but couldn't finish even the first volume.  There was an intelligent and  interesting woman there, but I didn't feel I was really getting to her.  The diary entries I read were too cool, too discursive for my taste.<br />Then  _Henry and June_ came out in 1986.  It covered the exact same period  (Paris, 1931) as &quot;Volume I&quot; of Nin's diaries -- first published,  but in highly edited form one could now see, in 1969.  Here she begins to  cheat on her husband Hugo with the young Henry Miller, meets and flirts  with his flighty wife June, and opens to life and eventually other men in  an explosive fashion.  HERE was the flesh-and-blood woman I had sensed  behind the original published diaries.  She panted, she sweated, she lied,  she used filthy language as well as high poetry, and she adored love and  sex.  I thought she was a wonder. Nin and Miller collide like titans;  sparks fly when they talk and when they make love.<br />Unfortunately, I have  read several of the subsequent, increasingly-appalling unexpurgated  diaries, as well as the biographies by Noel Riley Fitch and Deirdre Bair.  The bloom is definitely off the rose.  Ms. Nin turns out to have been a  consummate deceiver (though of herself as much as anyone else), an artist  manque who thought herself -- wished herself -- far more talented than she  turned out to be.  She works better in fantasy than reality; I still might  have liked to meet her in her prime, but it would have been dicey to get  involved with her.<br />It is in this book that she shows to her best as a  character (never mind whether it's all true or another kind of fiction).  Here one sees a woman's passion in all its riotous fire and  self-contradiction.  Just read this one and leave all the rest (save,  perhaps for the curious erotica and a decent collection of essays entitled  &quot;In Favor of the Sensitive Man&quot;), unless you have a penchant for  the odd and pretentious.avor of the Sensitive Man&quot;), unless you have a penchant for  the odd and pretentious.	2000-05-05

I was not prepared for how excellent and absorbing it turned out to be.<br />_Explaining Hitler_ does NOT explain the mystery of der Fuhrer.  In fact, it often questions whether such a thing  can ever fully be done.  The book is about the various parties who have  devoted much of their lives to the attempt -- their theories, their  possible motivations, the pitfalls and blind spots -- and in the course of  that raises larger issues about the nature of knowledge, of history, of  identity. The book manages a marvelous, near-perfect balance between  narrative and theory, speculation and investigation, philosophy and  psychology, character portraits and historic background.<br />Part of what  makes Rosenbaum's book so enthralling is that he not only describes the  arguments of various individuals and schools of thought, but seeks out the  representative authors and chats with them in person, which enlivens the  text considerably. We get to meet the historians, stately Professor  Hugh-Trevor Roper (who is certain Hitler firmly believed everything he  said) and Alan Bullock, (more inclined to regard Hitler as a manipulative  mountebank).  Rosenbaum spends time with canny, insecure David Irving, back  in the news in April 2000 for losing a libel suit in London against Deborah  Lipstadt for highlighting him as a Holocaust denier (or at best,  minimizer).<br />Rosenbaum's judgments are fair and judicious, he never  dislikes any of his subjects entirely, but he is not afraid to call someone  out for intellectual hypocrisy and bullying (as in the case of  &quot;Shoah&quot; documentary filmmaker Claude Lanzmann, who comes across  as some sort of Old Testament prophet).<br />The statements and positions of  the various &quot;explainers&quot; clash and knock one another down.  Hitler and the Holocaust drive intelligent and thoughtful men to amazing  extremes.  Theologian Yehuda Bauer suggests God's silence might mean he is  either Satan too or a nebbish; Emil Fackenheim refuses to write or speak of  Hitler at all for 20 years;  George Steiner, author of the stunning  novelette &quot;The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H.&quot; theorizes that  Kafka metaphorically invented Hitler, and far from expressing something  inherent in the German soul, Hitler might have risen to power even faster  in France.<br />Like God, I find Hitler himself a bore, because insufficient  evidence seems to guarantee no final understanding.  But looking at those  who try to account for him, thinking about how we ourselves see him, the  world he came from, the world we live in because of him, is a fascinating  process, and Rosenbaum's tremendous book is a great contribution to that  form of inquiry.nebbish; Emil Fackenheim refuses to write or speak of  Hitler at all for 20 years;  George Steiner, author of the stunning  novelette &quot;The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H.&quot; theorizes that  Kafka metaphorically invented Hitler, and far from expressing something  inherent in the German soul, Hitler might have risen to power even faster  in France.<br />Like God, I find Hitler himself a bore, because insufficient  evidence seems to guarantee no final understanding.

From my perspective, having written and received some dynamite love letters over the years without ever turning to reference works or instruction, this book would only be of use to a person who was either too young really to be in love (say, a 12-year-old), or too illiterate to express something honest, true, and vulnerable that is direct from the heart...<br />I suspect I won't be buying a copy of Mr. Movsesian's poems, thank you very much.

How interesting you find the book, then, depends on how deeply you want to  delve into yourself.<br />The questions deal with everything from personal  tastes and desires (such as whether you would prefer the free, unlimited  services of an extremely good cook, chauffeur, housekeeper, masseuse, or  personal secretary for five years), to personal behavior (when was the last  time you sang to yourself, and to someone else? do you tend to listen or  talk more in conversations?), to fascinating and challenging hypotheticals  (what you would do if you could successfully wish people dead without  getting caught, or whether you would leave the country forever for a  million dollars -- although that was worth a bit more when this book first  appeared, 13 years ago).<br />The questions are nicely arranged in no  particular order, so each turn of the page brings a surprise and a shift,  from mere daydreams to extreme tests of personal values.  It might make a  great conversation starter -- I seem to recall discussing some of the  questions and answers with my girlfriend at the time -- but some questions  may be a little uncomfortable among relative strangers.<br />If you keep a  journal (or perhaps if you've had difficulty doing so), this book is an  excellent spur to writing and thereby learning a little more about  yourself.  I answered most of these questions in my journal when I first  got this book in about 1988, and I think perhaps now might be a good time  to answer them all again (before reading what I wrote so long ago) and see  how my answers compare.  I recommend this activity to anyone....	2000-05-01

I cannot gainsay either judgment, nor would I desire to.  I first read these two volumes when I was about 11 and they were just a  couple years old (first published 1967); when the Speckled Band could give  me nightmares.  I bought my boxed set (2nd edition, 6th printing, 1971)  from the downtown Boston Barnes and Noble when I started college in 1977.  They have traveled everywhere with me since.<br />This version of the canon  cannot be praised too highly.  The first hundred pages of volume 1 (which  is about 690 pages total) consist of essays about the background of the  author and characters, real life models for the protagonists, early  translations and dramatizations on stage and celluloid, clubs devoted to  the immortal pair, and other fascinating background info.  There are  helpful maps of London and England as well.<br />Once the stories begin (and  flow into Volume 2, which is an even heftier 824 pages), the lucky reader  enjoys not only plentiful marginal notes (not end or footnotes, but  comments right next to the text where each reference appears) about guns,  money, locales, historic events, and just about anything one might not know  if one weren't a Victorian.  There are also reproductions of illustrations  that accompanied the stories in the Strand and other magazines where they  initially appeared.<br />This is a pair of books to treasure and reread (I've  read a number of my favorites, such as &quot;Silver Blaze&quot; and  &quot;The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle,&quot; aloud to friends, family,  and lovers) all one's life.	2000-04-28

Although I vaguely noted the news stories when this band of idiots went on the road in 1993, I only ran across this book by chance three days ago. I read it in less than two. Although the whole idea of authors forming a rock band and doing a tour sounds pretty stupid and self-indulgent, the results were not only good for them, but surprisingly moving and inspiring for  anyone who might read this book.  I'm sure I enjoyed it no less than the  two previous reviewers, but I'm a tough grader, so I gave it four  stars.<br />I always knew Stephen King and Dave Barry were regular guys I  would just love to meet and have a beer with, but what a shock to find out  about the lovely, funny, human sides of Amy Tan, Barbara Kingsolver, Al  Kooper (the musical director of this motley crew), Dave Marsh (rock critic  and editor) and others!<br />I laughed 'til I cried over Barry's chapter.  Everyone has his or her funny moments, but the chapters by Tan, Kingsolver,  and Marsh are refreshingly touching and vulnerable, too.<br />Best  quotes:<br />--King calls himself &quot;a kind of Norman Rockwell version of  Freddy Krueger&quot;<br />--Kooper: &quot;The mere fact that you're reading  this right now is a testimony to the selfishness of twenty-three bored  people.&quot;<br />--Roy Blount, Jr.: being on stage in a rock and roll band  is &quot;like being inside a forest fire that you're helping, however  modestly, to spread&quot;<br />--music critic Joel Selvin: &quot;Most people  seem to think critics are as useful as tits on a priest.&quot;<br />--Barry:  &quot;Our groupie budget is kinda low, so we're not getting top quality --  at times, they get a little angry at us and throw their walkers at us and  stuff like that.&quot;<br />--Barry again: &quot;...you can imagine how  excited I was when I discovered Buddy Holly.

His motto was &quot;I can write better than anyone who can write faster than me, and I can write faster than anyone who can write better than me.&quot;  He covered the war in Africa and Europe among the dogfaces, and is also famous for his writings  about boxing and French cuisine (he loved Paris and Normandy) after the  war.<br />But I prefer his critiques of his own profession.  After World War  II, he revived a department in The New Yorker that was handled by Robert  Benchley between 1927 and 1937 called &quot;The Wayward Press.&quot;  Most  of the items in this book are from that column and have an autobiographical  bent, at least with regard to his career as a writer for  newspapers.<br />Besides being a terrific writer to begin with, Liebling was  great at skewering the weaknesses of his own profession and colleagues.  Many newspaper readers simply do not know how to read a newspaper  critically -- analytically -- and the occasional datedness of Liebling's  subject matter -- a meat shortage in 1946, for example -- is more than made  up for by the instruction in how to be an astute consumer of news.<br />And he  is eminently quotable.  Some samples: &quot;A newspaper gives the reader  the impression of being closer to life than a book, and he is likely to  confuse what he has read in it with actual experiences he has not  had.&quot;  The book's dedication reads: &quot;To the Foundation of a  School for Publishers, Failing Which, No School of Journalism Can Have  Meaning.&quot;<br />&quot;The great row over [so-and-so's story]...served to  point up the truth that if you are smart enough you can kick yourself in  the seat of the pants, grab yourself by the back of the collar, and throw  yourself out on the sidewalk.&quot;<br />And finally: &quot;Sometimes news  disappears for years at a time, as in the period ... when there was nothing  to write about but the Medicine Ball Cabinet and dance marathons. News is  like the tilefish, which appears in great schools off the Atlantic Coast  some years and then vanishes no one knows whither, or for how long.  Newspapers might employ these periods in a search for the breeding grounds  of news, but they prefer to fill up with stories about Kurdled Kurds and  Calvin Coolidges, until the banks close or Hitler marches, when they are as  surprised as their readers.&quot;<br />Read this, or any Liebling, as part of  the essential education of a good American citizen.lefish, which appears in great schools off the Atlantic Coast  some years and then vanishes no one knows whither, or for how long.

I've read most of Findley's other novels (see my review of _The Telling of Lies_ for more on the author and his other books), and none measures up to this one ... but few OTHER writers' novels  do, either.<br />God is tired, and depressed. He gets no respect any more, so  he decides to do away with himself; hence, the flood. (This was back in the  days of unicorns, fairies, and elves.) But before destroying everything,  God tips off his devoted servant Dr. Noyes, who is, not to put too fine a  point on it, a total jerk: obsessed with God's law and with doing what is  right in God's eyes.<br />The real hero of the story is Mrs. Noyes, an  alcoholic who stows bottles of gin about the house and talks to animals.  Part of the story is narrated by her cat, Mottyl. God's lovely fallen angel  Lucifer senses that something big is up and transforms himself into a  beautiful woman in order to hook up with Ham and make it onto the ark.  (Another of Noah's sons tried to run away, fell in with some bandits who  threw him in a pot and tried to eat him, and he was lucky to escape with  his skin permanently turned blue.)<br />Power blocs form and struggle on the  ark, secrets are kept and revealed, and what seems like a quirky, amusing  fantasy inexorably transforms itself into an apocalyptic horror. The  language is simple and spare, but the imagery and the plot it relates is  unbearably rich.<br />There isn't one superlative I wouldn't lavish on this  book.  You should do your utmost to find a copy for yourself  (It took my  wife four months to secure a copy with the intent of trading it away at a  &quot;book gift&quot; party she intends to throw at our house; the book  made her cry.)	2000-04-26

Yet Homes manages to make the supposedly tired and overworked theme of suburban alienation and angst suprisingly gripping.  For the first half to two-thirds of the book, I enjoyed it as a sort of cartoon for grownups, with dimly recognizable people involved in farcical situations, and a sort of mild but ever-present threat in every line that seemed to promise anything could happen.  Dialogue seems especially rich with implications and unspoken realities.  (The word &quot;fine&quot; and variations on &quot;Everything's fine&quot; somehow rung every tone from biting irony to utter sincerity.)<br />But by the last third I found myself laughing out loud on occasion, and surprised to find myself actually caring about Paul and Elaine, the central couple of the plot.  How did Homes do that?<br />Strange things happen all through the narrative -- a couple impulsively attempts to burn down their house, female suburbanites initiate a fiery sexual affair, a cop commits attempted rape -- but the author often manages to pinpoint the motivations of the characters to perfection.  The sex between Paul and his mistress, &quot;Mrs. Apple,&quot; for example, seems to capture the essence of an affair when it works.<br />I'm convinced this writer can do just about anything she wants.  The only reason I give this book four stars is to indicate that _The End of Alice_ was a little stranger, a little more bracing, a little better. I'm rating Homes against herself here, not against other writers.	2000-04-26

I know she has published  others in her native language -- at least one a detective novel.  A Danish  AFS exchange student told me the author was regarded by Danes-on-the-street  as a racy eccentric; the only other place I've heard of her was in Brenda  Venus's weird book about her affair of the mind with aged Henry Miller, in  which Brogger is shown paying a respectful visit to the old codger.<br />I  assume the chapters of this book were originally magazine and newspaper  pieces.  Most of them construct elegant, logical, even erudite arguments  that lead to outrageous conclusions; to wit, that monogamy, the family, and  children should be abolished; and that males should be barred from higher  education, at least for a while.  All this is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, of  course, but Brogger raises interesting points along the way.<br />There is  also a hair-raising discussion of rape, and an elegiac description of a  visit to the public baths in pre-revolutionary Iran (shades of Anais  Nin!).<br />This book and I go back a ways.  I first stumbled on it around  1978 in the bowels of Harvard's Pusey library.  (The women's issues, love  and sex collections were held underground -- ponder THAT for symbolism.)  Five years later I seriously pondered stealing one of the Boston Public  Library's three copies, which were obviously not doing a brisk business of  circulating, but thankfully discovered a used copy in the Boston Book  Annexe near Fenway Park.  I wrote Ms. Brogger a fan letter in 1983 care of  her Danish publisher and received a gracious reply in English.<br />Brogger  rocks!in English.<br />Brogger  rocks!	2000-04-07

Freud and Lou Andreas-Salome have walk-on roles.<br />Nietzsche  has been going from one physician to another for his migraine headaches and  other physical ailments.  Lou Salome maneuvers him unknowingly toward  Breuer, who effects a proto-psychoanalytic cure through the ruse of having  Nietzsche treat HIM ... although the treatment of the doctor by the patient  becomes something real in the course of the story.<br />The dialogue is not  entirely convincing.  Yalom obviously knows his Nietzsche as well as his  psychology and medicine, and one can sense him slipping his own clinical  insights into Breuer's ruminations and projections of the future of  &quot;mind healing&quot; (must they always be right on the money?).  Nietzsche and Breuer come across more convincingly in their letters and  notes -- perhaps because we readers are more used to encountering 19th  century luminaries through their written words.<br />The denouement is a  little too pat.  A stimulating crisis and possible catastrophe seem to  develop, and then are jerked from our hands.  Perhaps Yalom should not have  tried so assiduously to keep his plot within the bounds of historical  possibility and instead played more freely with his characters.  Still, it  is nice to see someone attempt this sort of thing with such substantial and  intimidating historic figures.	2000-04-04

Imagine trying to choose three -- rarely as much as five -- answers to  represent everything these 5,000-plus men had to say in response to each of  the 313 questions.  Do you choose the most representative answer?  The  wittiest?  The funniest?  Most thoughtful?  Most shocking?<br />In many cases,  it is obvious the authors have chosen one or two of the latter ... but how  is a reader to know which answers best represent the majority of the male  sex?  As a man, I found some of the vitriol and caricaturing of the male  sex indulged in by some of the interviewees to be as bad (and inaccurate)  as anything I've ever heard a woman say about men.  What does this do for  us?<br />The information in this book has all the titillation -- and  corresponding weightlessness -- of secrets shared by an utter stranger at a  cocktail party.  There's no context for the content; it's of no earthly use  to the reader beyond a fleeting instant of entertainment.  The book is  rather like a greatly extended version of a typical women's magazine  article for which the reporter has chatted with three to five friends and  thereupon uses the conversations either to construct a portrait of the  sexes whole cloth, or merely to confirm her own preexisting conception of  how the sexes relate and play.	2000-03-31

I gouged the grooves  out of each album from _Get Your Wings_ through _Rocks_ before moving on to  more sophisticated pastures.<br />This &quot;autobio&quot; employs the fairly  interesting ploy of having the band members, their roadies, and colleagues  speak in their &quot;own voices&quot; -- that is to say, 99 percent of the  text is transcripted commentary and reminiscence.  As such, it reads very  easily.  And it covers most of the story, good and bad.<br />So there's plenty  of debauch and drugs, all of which has a horrid fascination for the reader.  For every lovely tale, such as the composition of &quot;Walk This  Way&quot; (inspired by the movie &quot;Young Frankenstein,&quot; of all  things, whereupon Tyler loses his lyrics two or three times before getting  it right), there's something you probably rather would not have known --  such as the fact that Steven Tyler acquired legal guardianship of a  14-year-old girl from Portland, Oregon from her parents so she could live  with him for three years, have to get an abortion, etc., etc.  (Wonder  where she is now?)<br />Although reading this book made me want to drag out my  long-unheard Aerosmith LPs and cassettes, knowledge such as this makes it a  little harder to enjoy the music quite as much.	2000-03-30

What could I possibly add?<br />Just the testimony of a snooty 40-year-old who knows next to nothing about the  fantasy genre and rarely reads bestselling fiction. I have fond memories of  the Oz books, and loved _The Hobbit_ once upon a time, but I have never  read Lewis's Narnia series or heard of Alexander's Prydains and Susan  Cooper's books. The only fantasy I keep with me is Ray Bradbury's  _Something Wicked This Way Comes_, which I adore (and I suppose Timothy  Findley's incredible _Not Wanted On the Voyage_ and Bulgakov's _The Master  and Margarita_ qualify, although they are clearly for grownups). Of late I  have been reading nonfiction books about consciousness and memory,  _Gotham_, Elizabeth Wurtzel, and _The Intuitionist_.<br />The first time I  heard of Harry Potter was at a party in August 1999 when a fellow Harvard  alum told me he and his wife were reading the books to each other. It  sounded mildly interesting. A month or two later, the name was everywhere,  and I turned up my nose at it. If EVERYBODY was reading it, there couldn't  be that much to it. (I made the same minor error in years past with _Helter  Skelter_ and _The World According To Garp_, which turned out to be better  than I expected when I finally got to them, but not THAT great.) When I  heard Christian fundamentalists were attacking the books for  &quot;encouraging witchcraft and sorcery,&quot; however, I decided it was  my civic duty to read them. (Why isn't anyone protesting &quot;the torture  of animals&quot; -- blowing up a salamander with fireworks, petrifying a  cat -- in book two, by the way? Just kidding.)<br />I found this book  delightful. I read it aloud to my wife, and she read some to me when my  voice got tired. The characters are imaginative, the plot suitably  gripping, and there is plenty of humor -- broad and subtle -- to reach you  wherever your sensibility resides. Give it three stars for grownups and  four or five for kids. If the Potter books get lots of children to read,  more power to 'em. I don't remember taking Tolkien or Oz or Grimm fairy  tales seriously as a child (or even Santa, for very long); why are some  adults unable to believe most kids can separate fantasy from  reality?<br />We're on the downhill side of book two, and I think my wife  likes the stories even better than I do (not just because I do the voices  with great expression). I see that book four, not due out until July, is  the number one bestseller on Amazon. Nice work!bility resides. Give it three stars for grownups and  four or five for kids.

There is almost nothing in it beyond what one might have read years ago in books by Diana Russell, Catherine Itzin, Susan Cole, and others.<br />The authors give a little ground  in admitting that some women enjoy and create pornography, and that no  conclusive causal link between pornography and violence has been shown (and  possibly ever will be).  They admit to reading Linda Williams, Wendy  McElroy, Nadine Strossen, Laura Kipnis, and some of the other pro-porn  feminist commentators -- which is more than one may say for Dworkin and  MacKinnon, who resolutely pretend that valid feminist opposition to their  position doesn't exist.<br />But one reads the same old assumptions: the  culture &quot;is saturated with pornography&quot;;  one out of three  American women is said to report some form of sexual abuse;  &quot;violence  of various types is present in almost all pornography&quot;;  &quot;The  simple truth is that in this culture, men have to make a conscious decision  not to rape&quot; (I don't remember that one ever being an issue for me),  and so on.<br />Jensen has a quaint chapter in which he interviews porn users,  though more than 50 percent of them are convicted sex criminals (how's that  for a representative sample?).  While he acknowledges that &quot;most of  the pornography users who reported heavy consumption also reported no  abusive sexual behavior&quot; and &quot;some of the sex offenders reported  relatively light consumption,&quot; he also races past the significance of  remarks such as the one by a violent and abusive ex-Marine and lumber  worker who prefers &quot;fast-forwarding past scenes of women in  control&quot; (which simply don't exist in pornography, if one ascribes to  the authors' orthodoxy).<br />It's interesting to see how often and repeatedly  Americans from across the political spectrum -- religious fundamentalists  to radical feminists -- need to keep scratching this issue without ever  quite getting to the source of the itch ... when it just isn't an issue for  the rest of us.t ever  quite getting to the source of the itch ... when it just isn't an issue for  the rest of us.	2000-03-18

It appears to me that both the previous reviewers missed the point of this interesting book.  Let not the prospective reader be misled by them.<br />The thesis of Juffer's book is that anti-porn and anti-censorship  feminists alike have conducted their respective attacks on and defense of  pornography at an abstracted level which does not address the ways in which  production and marketing of erotic materials in the past have discouraged,  limited, and in some ways guided, women's interest in pornography.<br />She  suggests the advent of videocassettes, and the seeping of the erotic (and  even pornographic techniques) into other areas of domestic consumption,  have altered this in recent years.<br />Skip over the brief but dense  intellectual lingo in the introduction (folks named Ernesto Laclau, Chantel  Mouffe and the inevitable Foucault rear their heads), and move on to  Juffer's thoughtful and (yes, gail@ttlc.net) witty discussion of the  Victoria's Secret phenomenon, Black Lace, and the man from Mars, John  Gray.<br />What I found perhaps most interesting is Juffer's observation that  Black Lace, a successful series of British erotic novels written by and for  women, pay no more attention to safer sex practices than traditional  male-oriented porn.  She also quotes a &quot;Redbook&quot; magazine  reviewer who expresses disgust over a Candida Royalle Femme Productions  video in which a condom is incorporated into the lovemaking.<br />Perhaps the  sexes are not so unalike in their notion of what constitutes fantasy?	2000-03-18

There is plenty of wit and penetrating insight to  spare.<br />Most memorable are his pieces on fashion designers and models  (&quot;A friend of mine slept with one of these exquisite dream figures and  said it was like going to bed with a bicycle&quot;), the state of Utah (the  last place he got &quot;stinking incapable drunk ... because there are no  bars&quot;), and a great predecessor:<br />&quot;Recount Jane Austen's life to  a class in an American university, and there will be unseemly expressions  of shock that she knew nothing about life, man, meaning like well never  slept with a guy and like well was stuck in a crappy old house without an  icebox....

Books	3	3	3	N	N	Pleasant and breezy	I read this book when it first came out -- in 1977 as I was finishing high school.  Its cosmopolitan approach to relationships and the sexes was a bit beyond me at the time, but I have come back to this book once or  twice.<br />West covers the same territory that other folks from John Gray to  Barbara DeAngelis have tackled much more famously and profitably since.  Despite the awful title and some datedness, she still does it better than  they, partly because her point of view is more sophisticated to begin with  and it doesn't assume the sexes should necessarily accept themselves (as  opposed to each other) as we are.<br />A representative passage: &quot;If I  have dwelt at some length on the subject of marriage, I did not mean to  suggest that cohabitation is indeed 'the answer,' or that the differences  outweigh the similarities.  People who congratulate themselves on having  escaped the legal trap do not necessarily escape the psychological  consequences of marriage.  For when we form a pair bond -- meaning we share  sex, affection, and domicile with another person, whether of the same or  the opposite sex -- we tend to relate the arrangement to the only model we  know: the examples and experiences we've been exposed to are those of  marriage -- in particular, the marriage of our parents.  The pull is always  toward following a familiar pattern, and, since we usually follow the path  of least resistance (which generally turns out to be the toughest), we may  well wind up living by the hidden clauses of the contract we never  signed.&quot;<br />Most amusing and provoking, perhaps, is the chapter devoted  to sexual friendships (something Letty Cottin Pogrebin pretty much ruled  out some years later in _Among Friends : Who We Like, Why We Like Them, and  What We Do With Them_), for whose participants she apologetically can find  no better term than the semi-facetious &quot;balling buddies.&quot;<br />This  book is a quirky personal examination of the issues, not a generally  prescriptive discussion of &quot;how we ought to be,&quot; and for that  reason is a quiet winner.a generally  prescriptive discussion of &quot;how we ought to be,&quot; and for that  reason is a quiet winner.	2000-03-15

I stumbled on a copy of the 1971, revised second clothbound edition in a community college library and have never seen it anywhere else.<br />Kafka is a hard man to know, let alone  to like, through his fiction.  One feels respect, admiration, awe ... but  perhaps not affection or warmth.  This book, compiled by a youthful  acquaintance from his memories of chats with Kafka, provides a wonderfully  human, if dubiously accurate (how could he remember all these lengthy  quotations?), image of the man.<br />At times he seems pragmatically direct,  even patronising to his listener:  &quot;There is too much noise in your  poems; it is a by-product of youth, which indicates an excess of vitality.  So that the noise is itself beautiful, though it has nothing in common with  art.  On the contrary!  The noise mars the expression....&quot;  Sometimes  he can be sardonic, as when he refers to newspapers as the vice of  civilization -- they offer the events of the world with no meaning, a  &quot;heap of earth and sand&quot; -- and remarks, &quot;It's like smoking;  one has to pay the printer the price of poisoning oneself.&quot;  (Good  thing he didn't live to see TV!)<br />More often, Kafka comes across as some  sort of Zen master: &quot;Just be quiet and patient.  Let evil and  unpleasantness pass quietly over you.  Do not try to avoid them.  On the  contrary, observe them carefully.  Let active understanding take the place  of reflex irritation, and you will grow out of your trouble.  Men can  achieve greatness only by surmounting their own littleness.&quot;<br />Janouch  relates a story from his father that Kafka once paid a powerful  lawyer-friend to help out an injured laborer with his application for a  disability pension, get his rightful compensation, and beat Kafka's  employer, the Accident Insurance Institution.<br />Give this book five stars  for interest and readability, three stars for shaky accuracy, and average  at four.our.	2000-03-15

Intending only to learn more about my agent, I ended up reading the rest of the book because it's an easy read.<br />Baker devotes 3  to 6 pages to each of the 48 agents he interviewed (there are 44  interviews, but four involve partners or associate pairs), and as the  official Amazon reviewer noted, the format is somewhat formulaic.  Many of  the dreary complaints are the same, but Baker could hardly help  that.<br />What I would think he could have avoided -- aside from the factual  errors described in Craig Offman's 8/24/99 piece for Salon -- was having  his book embody some of the publishing industry problems it decries.<br />Even  someone totally outside the industry can pick up errors: Robert Lantz is  also spelled &quot;Lanz&quot; on p. 104; a pair of quotation marks ends p.  105 and the actual quote begins on the next page; rock journalist Mikal  Gilmore's name is misspelled as &quot;Mikhal&quot; twice in the body text,  although correctly listed in the index.<br />Film critic and journalist  Stanley Kauffmann is cited in passing on p. 32, and someone named  &quot;Stanley Kaufman&quot; surfaces on p. 148, unindexed.  I suspect they  are the same person.<br />Michael Stipe is identified as a &quot;celebrated  rock and roll photographer,&quot; when most people celebrate him as the  frontman of R.E.M.  Jean Naggar is reported to have discovered Jean Auel  &quot;at a writers' conference at Willamette, Oregon (where she  lived)&quot;; when it was the Willamette Writers Conference in Portland,  Oregon.  Such simple facts could have been checked -- and should have  been.<br />Even the cover art is unoriginal to the book: it is credited to  Photodisc, which I assume means it was snagged off some database of  images.<br />Despite these blunders, the book is a pleasant read.

I ripped through this book in a day and a half (that's while working full time, with an evening for a mandolin lesson).<br />Wilder's remarks are both engaging and  interesting. Although he claims not to have viewed most of his films in a  long time, his memory for (or perhaps willingness to talk about) specific  scenes, shots, and actors in great detail, as opposed to events in his own  life, is astonishing.<br />And the wit! The early movie &quot;Midnight&quot;  (directed by Mitchell Leisen, screenplay by Wilder and Brackett) was  &quot;very, very well done&quot; because &quot;[John] Barrymore was too  drunk to write his own scenes.&quot; Despite wild studio claims,  Cinemascope and other wide-screen tricks were not going to revolutionize  films, he asserts: &quot;The love story of two dachshunds, that was the  only thing it was good for.&quot; William Wyler &quot;had no original  ideas, but he did them to perfection.&quot; On Woody Allen: &quot;he's a  very, very cunning, sly guy who I wish would not act.&quot;<br />Though he  revels in praise, Wilder is remarkably fair, even harsh toward his own work  too. He recalls Pauline Kael's many criticisms of &quot;The Front  Page&quot; and concludes &quot;she was so absolutely correct.... I like  Pauline Kael. She never had a good word to say about my pictures. Maybe a  little bit ... 'Sunset Boulevard.' But she was more often right than  wrong....&quot;<br />Crowe is humbly unintrusive, yet his questions are well  researched and probing. You can feel the trust and the master-student  relationship grow steadily. Another plus with this book are the plentiful  and beautifully reproduced photos -- stills from the movies and on set/from  parties/life. Perhaps too many photos: I could have lived without seeing  the pale, topless image of (a probably morphine-ridden) Peter Lorre playing  tennis, but on the other hand, the shot of Barbara Stanwyck's legs (not the  first thing one remembers about her) on the set of &quot;Balls of  Fire&quot; takes your breath away.<br />I only wish I could be as sharp and  witty as Wilder at 90 (or even half that age!).thing one remembers about her) on the set of &quot;Balls of  Fire&quot; takes your breath away.<br />I only wish I could be as sharp and  witty as Wilder at 90 (or even half that age!).	2000-03-01

If you found Nabokov's _Lolita_ disturbing, if you couldn't stomach Ellis's  skillful but satirical and cold _American Psycho_, stay away from this  book.  It has both the warmth and tenderness of the former, and the  in-your-face graphicness of the latter (probably even more in-your-face  because of the warmth and tenderness). People have referred to the  pedophilia, masturbation, and murder; don't forget homosexual prison sex  and rape ... and how do you feel about saving scabs in a drawer for chewing  and sucking on later?<br />Some of the other Amazon reviews here have been  utterly hilarious: Homes should include them in splash pages of subsequent  editions.  There are the usual encomia and expressions of disgust, but  &quot;Billy Graham could just as well have written this&quot;?  uhum37 also  complains that &quot;every character remains profoundly moral&quot; --  another judgment I cannot understand for the life of me, but I will  nevertheless respond that the characters are telling their own stories (the  19-year-old's is additionally filtered through the sensibility of the  narrator, for the most part -- and of course they are apt to regard  themselves as moral.<br />Reviewers also ask the wrong questions.  &quot;Does  this story need to be told?&quot; one reader queried on 6/4/97.  Of course  not.  No story &quot;needs&quot; to be told, whether it's Alice In  Wonderland or Waiting for Godot.  The real question is, does a story compel  attention, does it make you think and feel (not necessarily think and feel  lovely thoughts!), and does it play fair and maintain a certain  plausibility even given its fantastic premises?  &quot;sevitt&quot; in  Israel wonders whether the narrator's reported flashbacks were true.  It  doesn't make any difference!

Ms. Dowling's story may have intimated something important about how women feel about themselves, especially out in the world, but she parrotted all the usual myths about men, and she couldn't even see the  point of her own experience.<br />At the heart of her argument is a tale of  her marriage, of a time when her husband became so depressed and passive  that he couldn't meet a job deadline, so Ms. Dowling did the job for him.  Her conclusion from this?  It wasn't &quot;really&quot; her, she was just  acting under the protection -- beneath the mask -- of her husband's name  and reputation!<br />The true lesson, however, was that she got the job done  -- never mind how.  It never seems to have occurred to her that males in  fact have to do this all the time: bluff, employ tricks and masks, pretend  to be &quot;men&quot; in order to get what they want or meet their  obligations.<br />Simone de Beauvoir is famous for having said women are not  born, they are made; catchy notion, but it's just possible that the same is  true of men.  The only difference is, our roles were once much better  defined: society put its arm around our shoulder, told us what to do, and  often made our way easier simply because we had the equipment between our  legs.<br />It's a different world now, and I think women and men are much more  like one another than they were ever allowed to be before.  Ms. Dowling,  certainly at the time she wrote this book, hadn't caught on to this.	2000-02-25

Years ago a girlfriend introduced me to _The Man Who Was Magic_, a delightful allegory I've taken with me everywhere since, but which does not appear anywhere in Amazon's offerings.  Only this week I finally picked up _The Snow Goose_, which didn't do much  for me I'm afraid, and then this one.<br />This is a peach!  Gallico wants to  pay tribute to the elder, working class British woman who cleans other  people's homes and is known as a char.  Widowed, near or in her 60s, Mrs.  Harris one day develops the notion of owning a Dior original, something  utterly perfect and beautiful ... but at 450 to 500 pounds (maybe $1200 in  the late 1950s when this book was published) far out of her budgetary  range.<br />How she does it, and what happens to her in Paris when she makes a  day trip to realize her dream, is the stuff of magic.  The characters are  all believable; what they say and do in any given situation is completely  plausible;  and yet the aggregate of events and coincidences that come  together to complete this tale are utterly (but forgivably) incredible --  as in any fairy tale.<br />Being a reader/viewer who has thrilled to Samuel  Beckett, Ingmar Bergman, and Harlan Ellison, I tend to avoid the word  &quot;heartwarming&quot; like the Black Death.  But that's the perfect word  for this lovely little book.	2000-02-23

I got the heroine mixed up in the personal  mythology of my mind with my high school girlfriend, Joni Mitchell, Anais  Nin, and all that is eternally mysterious and wonderful about  women.<br />Having read the book three or four more times, I am much better  able to appreciate the ideas -- existential, Darwinian, Marxist -- that fit  into the web of a rollicking good story.  This is a novel that punches the  head as unerringly as the heart.<br />And don't forget the element of PLAY:  Fowles has said this novel was written by a man who was very tired of  novels and the usual constraints under which they were written.  So there  are THREE endings: a false,  everything-tidied-up-as-it-would-have-been-in-a-true-Victorian-novel ending  about two-thirds through the book; and two opposing endings at the  finish.<br />Fowles reportedly even wrote a farcical chapter in the style of  Alice in Wonderland in which the narrator chases after the hero with an axe  ... but his wife and other advisors made him leave it out.  I hope we will  someday get to see that one.<br />Why did the latest publisher put a cute  blonde on the cover!  (I'm assuming she is NOT meant to depict the  secondary love interest, Charles's fiancee.)  This is almost as bad an  aesthetic decision as casting Meryl Streep in the movie version, though she  made an admirable attempt to be Sarah.  Try to get a copy with the original  cover art -- a choppy woodcut of a brunette with a distant gaze -- and that  will get you launched into the story in the right mood.	2000-02-18

A spotlight on the historic event gets five stars, the book only three. Ms. Chang indeed approaches the Rape of Nanking as a journalist, not as a  historian. Her book is messy, passionate, overboard at times, but vital  nonetheless. For too many years the Japanese did not want the story told  and the Chinese were &quot;enemies&quot; of the U.S., and both  circumstances combined to keep the truth hidden. Ms. Chang is to be  commended for her efforts to get the story out to a wider audience, however  imperfectly.<br />The book could be better documented, it could be both more  detailed and less passionate; with stories as horrifying as these, the  facts will speak for themselves. It is refreshing to hear about Nazi consul  John Rabe, the nun whose name escapes me, and the other quiet and forgotten  heroes of the international community who worked long and hard to save  lives in the middle of a firestorm.<br />The current Japanese government and  most of its historical and educational establishment has been despicable  about trying to deny the truth of this event, as was the case with Korean  &quot;comfort women&quot; and other historic blots. But this hardly  distinguishes it from other nations' coverups, or their misdeeds. Only in  1999 did public stories begin to surface of US Army atrocities against  civilians in the early days of the Korean War. The important thing is to  investigate, get the truth out, and speak out early and loud about  recurrences, from Rwanda to Groszny.<br />As for the reviewers who suggested  the Japanese &quot;deserved the atomic bomb,&quot; or the gentleman who  concluded the Japanese Army's behavior must have been the rationale for  locking up thousands of American citizens who happened to be of Japanese  descent (my mother among them) ... sorry, but a second terrible wrong does  not redress a first.

Darker, yes; there are more scary elements (a giant-spiders-in-the-forest scene highly reminiscent of  &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; but with a different twist), and more characters  hurt or imperiled. But quite a bit of humor, too, from the &quot;Happy  Deathday&quot; party and Moaning Myrtle, the ghost in the toilet, to just  about everything to do with the flashy but fraudulent wizard Gilderoy  Lockhart.<br />Lamentably, there is only one Quidditch game in this book, but  the self-driven car, the inspired new character of the elf Dobby, and other  elements (I especially loved the paragraph -- I think it comes from Ron --  describing deadly books) almost make up for that. I found the climax just a  little less compelling than the one in the first book, but perhaps that is  partly because the novelty has worn off just a bit.<br />(Typography note: my  hardcover copy misspells &quot;minuscule&quot; in a way that is all too  common on page 242; but otherwise this book appears to be cleaner than many  published solely for grownups these days.)<br />Happily on to book three....	2000-01-27

In the first category is the parrot's lament of the title, in  which a female African grey bemoaned the fate of a male she did not like  when her owner pulled a Cornish game hen out of the oven, and then grieved  again when the owner showed her the male was still alive. As an example of  the second, I think of the male orca who appeared to be monitoring his  mate's pregnancy by placing his head against her tummy, and then battered  his head against the edge of their Marineland pool in frustration shortly  before she miscarried. Or the great ape that rescued a human infant that  fell into its zoo enclosure.<br />Unbelievable are the many stories of  orangutan ingenuity in escaping their zoo cages and yards, or the  friendship between the wild turkey and the retired race horse.<br />I wanted  to like this book more than I ended up doing. The issue of animal  intelligence is an important and fascinating one, but I wish Linden had  delved deeper into the philosophical and scientific implications. The  anecdotes fly by with very little discussion. This approach was done better  (and with remarkably little overlap in stories) a few years back by Susan  McCarthy and Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson in _When Elephants Weep: the  emotional lives of animals_; granted, their subject was more specifically  emotions rather than cognition, but I found it a more thoughtful book.<br />In  addition, though _The Parrot's Lament_ is competently written, I found its  phrasing a little inelegant at times. I recorded it aloud for a broadcast  service for the blind and elderly shut-ins (&quot;Golden Hours&quot; at  KOPB in Portland, Oregon), and found myself stumbling over the verbiage  more often than usual.tland, Oregon), and found myself stumbling over the verbiage  more often than usual.	2000-01-27

I was introduced to it at the age of 15 or so, and stayed up most of the night to finish it the first  time. Years later, I wrote an undergraduate honors thesis on it for  Harvard, and received a magna cum laude for my efforts. (You can get a copy  of the text of my thesis at the Fatbrain Ematters web site.)<br />That being  said, I give this book 4 stars because Fowles has done better (clearly with  _The French Lieutenant's Woman_, perhaps with _Daniel Martin_ and other  more recent works), although it would merit 5 stars if almost anyone else  had written it. It's an early novel, an adolescent novel in many ways (and  Fowles has all but said as much himself). There are stretches of  magnificent writing -- short stories within a larger framing plot, such as  the Norway sequence and the Nazis on Phraxos -- as well as over-the-top  farcicality and a bit of dime-store philosophy that may or may not  impress.<br />Consider the missing star a warning, as well. This is a  three-ring circus of a book; it teases the reader, leads him or her down  garden paths and then repeatedly pulls the rug out. Some people find this  infuriating, the rest of us love it.	2000-01-24
US	53074766	R2VWMJI591AT0A	1573225126	662106244	Prozac Nation	Books	3	15	18	N	N	Decent and gripping writing, of questionable long-term value	This book is better than Wurtzel's later _Bitch_ because it's more focused. The author can write, and write well, but she seems to be more effective when she has a specific story to tell, rather than ranging around  through pop sociology and culture. She also has a tendency to drop names  and brag about her misadventures when it isn't terribly germane to her  story.<br />I did not find this account &quot;whine-y.&quot; Wurtzel seems  very honest and accurate about the hell of her mental turmoils. Having  known a brilliant but unstable person or two myself, it wouldn't surprise  me that Wurtzel may have experienced flashes of lucidity and searing  honesty about her dilemmas and selfishness even at the time. Unfortunately,  as engrossing a read as it makes, her experiences may be of doubtful  clinical value since most depressed teenagers do not get into Harvard,  cannot run away to Florida or London for a change of scene, or depend on  wealthy friends to keep them in cocaine.<br />The title makes no sense to me.  Prozac doesn't even make an appearance until deep in the story -- page 296  of a 351-page account -- and Wurtzel has very little to say about the drug  itself. Her remarks about &quot;prozac nation&quot; surface only briefly in  the epilogue. Her original title, &quot;I Hate Myself And I Want to  Die,&quot; would have been more appropriate.<br />Typographically, this book  fares better than many another bestseller these days, although there seems  to be a word missing from the sentence &quot;The first order of business  ... is finding a that will work&quot; on page 296, and surely someone could  have bothered to look up the proper spelling of Aleister Crowley (p. 270).	2000-01-24

What could I possibly add?<br />Just  the testimony of a snooty 40-year-old who knows next to nothing about the  fantasy genre and rarely reads bestselling fiction. I have fond memories of  the Oz books, and loved _The Hobbit_ once upon a time, but I have never  read Lewis's Narnia series or heard of Alexander's Prydains and Susan  Cooper's books. The only fantasy I keep with me is Ray Bradbury's  _Something Wicked This Way Comes_, which I adore (and I suppose Timothy  Findley's incredible _Not Wanted On the Voyage_ and Bulgakov's _The Master  and Margarita_ qualify, although they are clearly for grownups). Of late I  have been reading nonfiction books about consciousness and memory,  _Gotham_, Elizabeth Wurtzel, and _The Intuitionist_.<br />The first time I  heard of Harry Potter was at a party in August 1999 when a fellow alumnus  of Harvard told me he and his wife were reading the books to each other. It  sounded mildly interesting. A month or two later, the name was everywhere,  and I turned up my nose at it. If EVERYBODY was reading it, there couldn't  be that much to it. (I made the same minor error in years past with _Helter  Skelter_ and _The World According To Garp_, which turned out to be better  than I expected when I finally got to them, but not THAT great.) When I  heard Christian fundamentalists were attacking the books for  &quot;encouraging witchcraft and sorcery,&quot; however, I decided it was  my civic duty to read them. (Why isn't anyone protesting &quot;the torture  of animals&quot; -- blowing up a salamander with fireworks, petrifying a  cat -- in book two, by the way? Just kidding.)<br />I found this book  delightful. I read it aloud to my wife, and she read some to me when my  voice got tired. The characters are imaginative, the plot suitably  gripping, and there is plenty of humor -- broad and subtle -- to reach you  wherever your sensibility resides. Give it three stars for grownups and  four or five for kids. If the Potter books get lots of children to read,  more power to 'em. I don't remember taking Tolkien or Oz or Grimm fairy  tales seriously as a child (or even Santa, for very long); why are some  adults unable to believe most kids can separate fantasy from  reality?<br />We're on the downhill side of book two, and I think my wife  likes the stories even better than I do (not just because I do the voices  with great expression).

There is no such thing as a  &quot;characteristic&quot; Findley novel, and this is no exception.<br />With  _The Telling Of Lies_, the author takes on the murder mystery genre, but of  course it's not your typical mystery. It takes place on the south coast of  Maine, at a resort hotel with an assortment of characters. The  narrator/protagonist, a middle-aged woman, not only tackles and solves the  mystery, but intersperses the main plot with memories of her experiences in  a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp during the Second World War.<br />The story is  well told. I liked this book better than _Famous Last Words_ (though it is  a less complicated and momentous story) and _The Piano Man's Daughter_,  about as much as _The Butterfly Plague_ and his memoir/essay collection  _Inside Memory_, but not as much as his masterpiece, _Not Wanted On the  Voyage_.	2000-01-21

I was not in a position to appreciate it then, of course, but a couple of images stuck  with me forever. I saw a few more Kurosawas in high school, fortunately --  the earlier, butchered &quot;Seven Samurai,&quot; &quot;Yojimbo,&quot;  possibly one or two more -- and many others when I got to college in  Boston.<br />Kurosawa was one of the true artistic geniuses of the twentieth  century. His career as a screenwriter began during the Second World War and  as a director shortly after it. Despite the strange culture and often  historic settings of his stories, Kurosawa is perhaps the most  &quot;Western&quot; of Japanese film directors up to the 1970s. The plots  have a clarity, and the action (Samurai sword battles, for instance) a  vibrancy, that grip a viewer in a way lesser filmmakers on both sides of  the Pacific cannot hope to match.<br />His work has probably influenced more  other filmmakers than any director in or out of the US. Other reviewers  have named names; as to specific works, &quot;Rashomon&quot; was remade as  &quot;The Outrage,&quot; &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; turned into &quot;The  Magnificent Seven,&quot; &quot;Yojimbo&quot; became &quot;A Fistful of  Dollars,&quot; and &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; inspired &quot;Star  Wars.&quot; In turn, Kurosawa made films based on the plots of  &quot;Macbeth,&quot; &quot;King Lear,&quot; Dostoevsky's &quot;The  Idiot,&quot; and Gorky's &quot;The Lower Depths.&quot;<br />Richie's book does  this incredible writer and director's work full justice. His discussion of  plotting, acting, editing technique, and all the other aspects of this  great artist's work only deepen one's appreciation for what already loves  on screen. I have an original hardcover copy as well as the third revised  edition in paperback.	2000-01-21

True crime stories tend to have an unresolvable mystery at the heart of them: how could anyone possibly have done this terrible deed? This one  makes the crime seem utterly plausible and in fact inevitable. Its true  tale has the crushing majesty of a classic tragedy and demands our guilty  attention like a long, slow-motion train wreck. I'm convinced that  Lefkowitz presents the spirit of this ghastly story accurately, although as  Gregg G notes, he gets the Beastie Boys' debut album title wrong, among  other things. (Gregg in turn got the author's error wrong; Lefkowitz calls  it &quot;License to Kill&quot; on page 179 and &quot;Licensed to Kill&quot;  on page 248.)<br />The somewhat polarized reviews of this book are fascinating  in a way that continues the black-vs-white points of view of some of the  people inside the book. A reader from Glen Ridge defends the community, a  scoffer in Phnom Penh ridicules the book's politics, and Michael Torres  extends sympathy to the parents of the perpetrators, but all of these  responses miss (or dodge) the point; none has a thing to say about the  crime and how or why it happened -- never mind what punishment would be  suitable for the guilty parties, who at the time of the book's publication  had still not served any jail time, so far as I can tell. So the families  have suffered, Mr. Torres? What about the family of the victim? The victim  herself? (I kept thinking of that piercing moment at the conclusion of the  movie &quot;A Few Good Men,&quot; when one defendant turns to the other and  says, we failed our oath ... the victim was the kind of person we had sworn  to protect.) What about the attitude of the perps' families that they  hadn't done anything wrong? The way they overlooked such behavior as  trashing a house to &quot;punish&quot; an unpopular girl who dared to think  she could get them to like them by inviting them over? The way they tried  to trash the reputation of a victim who was different, not popular, and in  fact not capable of making choices in her own interest?<br />A reader from St.  Paul recommends H.H. Bissinger's _Friday Night Lights_. I thought of that  book too while reading this one.  There's no dark crime at the heart of  that book -- the real victims in that book are clearly the athletes  themselves.

(Just so you know, my favorite bands between ages 12 and 25 were, in chronological order, the Beatles, Creedence, Deep Purple, Yes, and Gentle Giant, although I had  everything from Led Zep and Pavlov's Dog to the Carpenters and the Banana  Splits in my collection. Now I listen to Oregon, Bobby McFerrin, Tingstad  &amp; Rumbel, the Bobs, Bartok, Stravinsky and Bach.) But I still love to  read rock criticism. Gilmore strikes me as one of the best.<br />This is a  collection, smoothed out and updated, of his writings from roughly two  decades of work for Rolling Stone magazine and various other publications.  Gilmore's judgments seem quite fair, and never dismissively exclusive for  effect the way many lesser critics can be, and his prose doesn't wave its  hands in the air a lot to distract you, which tends to happen with the late  Lester Bangs, or Greil Marcus. (Don't get me wrong, I enjoy them both!)<br />I  admired his heartfelt weighing of the career of Michael Jackson, who is so  easy to hate. Perhaps the loveliest surprises were his extended pieces on  people the young folks of our era won't know as well and won't be able gain  access to via recordings -- Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsberg and his  crowd.<br />If I have any complaint it is that Gilmore succumbs to a verbal  flourish at the conclusion of too many of these pieces on the order of  &quot;we will not likely hear this again&quot; or &quot;better than anyone  ever will,&quot; which may be true in every case, but somewhat gratuitous  and ultimately unknowable. (I also remain skeptical that  &quot;irrestrainable&quot; -- page 144 -- is actually a word.)	2000-01-18

Cronin, who certainly knows the lay of the land, the type of people, and even some of the actual folks Beckett knew, seems a fair and judicious  biographer. I found the book most useful in charting Beckett's development  as an artist from the callow &quot;knowingness&quot; of his early novels  and poems to the wry despair of his mature work. One is impressed both by  Beckett's inconsistent touchiness about the handling of his work by  adapters, and by his quiet generosity with near strangers as well as  friends. Cronin includes plenty of delightful trivia, from quotes (&quot;I  am not a philosopher; one can only speak of what is in front of one and  that is simply a mess&quot;) to the fact that Beckett always accented the  first syllable of Godot.	2000-01-12

After his superb L.A. quartet, Ellroy apparently wanted to tackle the underbelly of the entire nation  mid-century. The result is rapid-fire and messy, yet compelling as  always.<br />I find myself turning the pages of Ellroy's novels, even the  simpler early ones, too fast to grasp all of the plot, and it doesn't  really matter. But in this book there are a lot of four- and five-word  sentences in one- to three-sentence paragraphs; it's like trying to read  machine-gun fire. And along with the cast of a half dozen major characters,  there are dozens of walk-ons, from John and Robert Kennedy to Jimmy Hoffa.  This poses several difficulties.  For one thing, our own mental images of  these personages tend to get in the way of Ellroy's portrayal of them,  which is usually not deep and detailed enough to overcome our version. Even  the main characters are more sketchy than the ones in his L.A. novels. I  don't get as firm a sense of them -- or of the landscape -- as I do in The  Black Dahlia, The Big Nowhere and so on. The plots are no less complicated  in the L.A. novels, but they work better: reading them feels less like  skipping across the surface of a turbulent lake.<br />American Tabloid is sort  of an MTV-style police procedural/political thriller/noir. As gripping as  always, but just not as satisfying as Ellroy's best work.	2000-01-12

Those of us who are either already fans of her personally, or care deeply about  anti-nuclear and environmental issues, would more likely give it at least  four stars. Dr. Caldicott is an inspiration to anyone who either wants to  make a difference in the world, or fears that no one person can. She  started on her anti-nuclear campaign as an Australian pediatrician and  concerned mother -- writing an angry letter to the editor about French  nuclear tests in the South Pacific (which did not get published) -- and  went on to found Physicians for Social Responsibility and to inspire  millions. I've seen Dr. Caldicott speak twice, and she's a marvel. She has  authored other books, _Missile Envy_ and _If You Love This Planet_ among  them, about more specific issues; this is a very personal account, in which  she is honest about her failures, disappointments, setbacks, loneliness,  and fear of death. But it is ultimately a triumph of the will and spirit. I  wish her many more years of health, happiness, and successful activism.	2000-01-05

Wurtzel's mind ranges across a variety of topics, from pop culture and pop villains (from Amy Fisher to Hillary Clinton) to Orthodox Judaism and  spiritual values in the widest sense of the term. I especially liked her  thoughts in the Fisher chapter (not so much about the girl herself, but  what men and the culture make of relatively innocent/ignorant but nubile  teenaged females), and on the role Nicole Brown Simpson and her family  played in her ultimate fate. Unfortunately, the book often rambles (my eyes  tended to start skimming paragraphs at times), and Wurtzel is prone to  shooting off her mouth both in terms of snap judgments about vast  sociological phenomena and in condemning celebrities for this or that lapse  in taste or behavior. She's especially stupid in her statements about men  -- not particular men, but all men -- which reminded me of Collette  Dowling's _The Cinderella Complex_; both authors may have a lot of  important things to say about how women think and feel, but they parrot  many of the usual lies about men. At the same time, Wurtzel tends to want  to brag about her own achievements and misbehavior -- not in any  instructive detail, just breezy asides. There's a thoughtful, sensitive  woman behind this book, and one gets glimpses of her along the way, but  she's often outyelled by a grandstanding girl who has her eye on  manufacturing an image that gets attention and sells books. And I'm not  sure what a lot of the admittedly entertaining prose has to do with proving  her thesis, whatever it is. She thanks a lot of people for advice and  editing, but I'm afraid they just didn't do enough.	2000-01-04

Too many folks resort to five stars to make writing a review worth their while, and seem to regard three stars as an indication of failure by an author when it  ought to signal a good, readable effort.  I award The Intuitionist four  stars for a fine first novel with a controlled voice and interesting  approach.  Whitehead manages to build tension and suspense in a story where  the reader has no idea what the heroine intends to do or even should do.  It's a mystery where no one dies.  There are lots of curious events and  clues, seemingly pregnant with meaning, that turn out to mean something  very different than what one thought, or nothing at all.  I liked this book  very much.  Don't go in expecting either belly laughs or Pynchon; it's not  that kind of novel.  But a very fine one in its own right.	1999-12-20

I am currently making my way through Powers's books in a mostly chronological manner.  I gave this one four stars only because I preferred _Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance_ and _The Gold Bug Variations_ (read  out of sequence, of course), but measured against most other writers'  novels this would probably get five stars.  As someone else said, it starts  out more modestly, and I thought I wasn't going to get the mind-blowing  intellectual and philosophical richness I had encountered in the two other  books, but then Walt Disney and the Japanese-American internment enter the  story and things get really strange.  This guy is an amazing writer.	1999-04-30

Some of the behaviors described -- drinking urine or applying it to wounds, placing maggots on festering skin to draw out the  dead and dying cells -- possess a horrid fascination for the lay reader,  but the authors describe quite dispassionately the possible scientifically  valid reasons behind them.  Very interesting stuff.	1999-04-30

The protagonist Fisher is a lovely, pleasant creation  who gets into the unlikeliest scrapes which will indeed make the reader  laugh out loud.  Watch for yuppie Alison and her red pen.  Anyone who knows  Boston and Cambridge will recognize many of the eateries and watering holes  presented in thin disguise (unless they've closed since I lived there).  If  this book is and remains out of print, this is a crime!	1999-02-08

Callow catches Welles out at countless examples of self-mythologizing, yet never gloats or judges him  harshly -- merely letting his findings speak for themselves.  And he  doesn't diminish Welles's achievements or fascination as a man one whit.  (Nor does he customarily split infinitives, which is refreshing in this day  and age.) Though personal failings and the stuff of gossip are noted,  Callow does not dwell upon them.  His descriptions of Welles's stage  productions in the 1930s and early 1940s especially make me wish I had been  alive then -- or videotape technology had existed -- in order to see them.  The introduction notes that most studies of Welles ask &quot;what went  wrong after _Citizen Kane_&quot;?  Callow sought to discover what went  wrong BEFORE it, and I think he did an admirable job.  I can hardly wait  for the second volume.	1998-11-09

Longtime fans will recognize familiar themes such as time travel of one sort or another to make amends (&quot;That Woman On the Lawn,&quot; &quot;Last Rites,&quot;), fairly old fashioned horror tales (&quot;The Finnegan,&quot; &quot;The Witch Door,&quot; &quot;Free Dirt&quot;), the never-forgotten carnival characters (&quot;The Electrocution&quot;), and the elegiac yearning for the old and familiar amid the shock and speed of the new (&quot;The Other Highway,&quot; which seems to pick up where &quot;Yes, We'll Gather at the River&quot; in _I Sing The Body Electric_ left off).  But there are no mind-blowing stories in this bunch, nothing on the order of &quot;A Sound of Thunder,&quot; &quot;The Utterly Perfect Murder&quot; or &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot; -- pick your own favorites.  It's just lovely to see the master still at it after all these years	1996-11-26

(See, for example, Nadine Strossen's _Defending Pornography_ and Wendy McElroy's _XXX:A Woman's Right to Pornography_.)  Kipnis takes as her jumping-off point the case of a gentle, well-behaved gay man who was given a long jail sentence for responding to fantasy bait concocted by the FBI on the Internet;  somehow, discussion (read: Orwellian &quot;thought crime&quot;) of sex and murder of children translated to hard time in jail.  Mere ideas are NOT innocent in this country, after all.  [But why don't we jail authors and fans of murder mysteries and true crime books, or at least TRACK them?)  She goes on to study the odd byways of pornography: magazines of nude and copulating fat people, geriatric porn, transvestite pornography.  If you've never seen such material and tend to assume it must connect to mental illness and criminality, Kipnis will give you much to think about.  Her discussion of the ideology and techniques of Hustler magazine is nothing short of brilliant, even for the men -- and we are legion -- who have always found the magazine disgusting or beneath notice.  A welcome addition to the public debate over durdy peek-chures	1996-11-26
US	53074766	R1XJAYIMJYF9D6	0060171405	351040073	The Power of Beauty	Books	3	7	10	N	N	Friday does her thing again, as only she can	Somewhere between the raging feminists on the anti-porn left and the blithe Camille Paglias of the neo-con(?) left lies the sexy common sense of Nancy Friday.  In this book she talks about the way beauty -- the beguiling attraction of it and social imperatives that surround it -- thrill and oppress both women AND men.  More than almost any other popular female writer on social topics today, Friday loves and sympathizes with men;  she understands what most males have to go through and she wants everyone to give guys a break -- so much so that it's almost embarrassing to a fellow who has had any exposure to feminist issues.  Her reconstruction of female experiences in adolescent are especially excruciating.  This is a long, slow ramble through both social issues and Friday's opinions and life.  There's a little titillation, for longtime Friday fans -- she relates some early teen lesbian experiences -- and plenty of references to recent theories and findings in social and pop psychology.  One might have liked a little muscular editing on this tome, but there are still too few writers in that erotic, sensible center where Friday has taken up permanent residence	1996-11-26
