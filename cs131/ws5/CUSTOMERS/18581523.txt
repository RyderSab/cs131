It's a case Bosch has to travel back and forth to Vegas for answers, and we get to sit back and enjoy the ride. For this reader I had no complaints.

This was my first book by Carl Hiaasen, and it started out pretty good for this reader, but then the story and characters went to cartoon-land (hence the jacket cover)and left me dazed and confused as to what is supposed to be a good book these days.<br /><br />Prior to reading \\"Skinny dip\\" I had just re-read \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" which I DID find \\"funny\\" and \\"entertaining\\" (gentle steer), so maybe I was a little jaded, expecting a little too much from a modern day best seller.	2005-10-02

I laughed throughout the neurotic but hip narrative and was surprised at how current this (early-fifties) character is to todays youth.<br /><br />Holden's kid sister Phoebe gave the story so much heart and love, she was a wonderful foil to Holden's angst and she gave the story a life-affirming spin that has made this book a true classic.	2005-09-23

Lead character LuAnn Tyler, a trailer park mom who suddenly wins a \\"fixed\\" 100 million dollar lottery, was so real and human you had to cheer for her, even when she did something stupid, you hoped it would work out. She meets Charlie, and together they make the rest of the story suspenseful as they battle wits with the ruthless Jackson, the evil lottery bad-guy.<br />The ending could have been better, but the total sum for this reader was a good read, and a good time.	2005-08-14

I don't know why all her male romantic leads have harsh, haughty personalities, always spewing multiple obscenities at the beginning and close of every sentence, and the classy heroine always finds them irresistible... Women?<br />I gave Brown's \\"Envy\\" 5 stars, so that's the reason for my disappointment. This novel has absolutely no one to cheer for (unlike Envy's Maris), very predictable stereotypes, little imagination,(unlike Envy's book within a book) the only bright spot for me was the last page. Do yourself a favor, skip this one and read \\"Envy\\"	2005-07-22

Isn't that what any fair-minded person wants to believe about those who protect and serve. That's what makes you like Detective Harry Bosch, despite his many character flaws, deep down he's a good man. Even though in this story he's more uncompromising and on edge. He's filled with a lot of rage at the police, the system, and the suspects who murdered his mother over thirty years ago. A good cop thriller you won't be disappointed. Great writing.	2005-05-28

For me, this story might have been stronger if there were a few less family members to keep track with. Maybe one daughter and one step-daughter, and a few less grandkids. Still, the reading had all the familiar witty and wry moments that only Tyler can weave you in and out of so brilliantly. My favorite scene was the dinner with Will Allenby's daughter. All in all, a good book. I was just a little disappointed in the development of the story and characters.	2005-05-08

I'm aware there's a movie that was made from this novel, but I don't feel any inclination to see it. There's a brilliant country song by Brad Paisley  that goes, \\"who needs pictures with a memory like mine\\"...The dramatic poetic ending made me cry(it was soooo rich)...I will say this book started off slowly for me with characters and a storyline that initially felt a little stock. But like other Anne Tyler novels I've read, her characters have to simmer and stew awhile in your brain till you suddenly find yourself drawn into their very savory world.	2005-03-27

I was turned off by all the magic laden plot twists which for me were too unrealistic, even if this guy is a pro illusionist. I guess if you can believe somebody doing the cartoon style magic tricks he does, then it goes by better for you.<br />I also didn't care for the lead character Lincoln Rhyme and his whole troop of police friends. This was my first book by Deaver, and more than likely my last.	2005-03-17

Connelly tells an interesting story of the hazards of being a good Samaritan. I thought Pierce (the protagonist) did some things most people wouldn't do, but Connelly, like most great writers, gives you solid-reasoning why the unlikely can be plausible. As with other Connelly books I've read, the ending was satisfying but could've been better for this reader. Still highly recommended.	2005-03-05

Linda Howard is a superb storyteller, but most of all I loved the storyline in this novel from beginning to end. Howard has a gift of making the reader feel they're right in the middle of some pretty hairy situations. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good story with believable dialogue, interesting characters, and exciting places.	2005-02-25

So I was expecting a great read and I wasn't disappointed. The old south's racial code of ethics, were written with a great deal of insight and I thought it was very interesting comparing it with our current day struggles with race relations. Needless to say we've come a long way, thanks to people's attitudes  like the character Atticus portrayed in this book. A must read.	2005-02-11

I found the lead character likeable, and his ride to riches, fun and exciting. The story whooshed along like a cool movie you can't take your eyes off. (I kept seeing Charlie Sheen as Carter).  I wish Grisham gave this book a little more substance and suspense towards the end so I could give it more than 3 stars, but it still was a good read.	2005-02-04

Tyler always let's you wallow in the gray areas of the vivid characters she paints, which let's us all choose sides. For me, the protagonist Barnaby was too shady and weird to be as lovable as some readers have reported here in their reviews. I was rooting for Sophia to be free of him and not get hurt. And unlike a lot of other readers opinions, I liked Sophia, and found her to be someone I cared about in the story. Meanwhile, I thought his mother Margo-Mar gott, had every reason to be up in arms with his senseless behavior. Overall I loved the book, but I wish there was another chapter to resolve the love relationship issue. I'm not sure I got it? Or is that the point? Having said that, I've read (in many reviews) how others thought it ended perfectly. Interesting.	2005-01-29

The first \\"The Crush\\" left me feeling a little flat with characters I didn't feel for, but \\"Envy\\" is one of the best suspense novels I've ever read. I see how some detractors felt it was unrealistic at times, but for me, Brown knows how to write her scenes in such a seamless manner I had no trouble buying whatever plot twist she had coming. This book would make a great movie, I wonder has one been made? Looking forward to reading more of Sandra Brown's work even if I pay full price.	2005-01-20

I'm glad to say I felt this book was the opposite. This is my fourth Anne Tyler book and I was a little put off at first by the depressing characters, but that helped add emotion to the way the story resolved. I was surprised at how emotional I became after finishing this book. It was as if, I had just lived with the characters instead of reading about them(to paraprhrase another Amazon review.) Can't wait to read and live with my next Tyler novel!	2004-12-04

It makes her storytelling very elegant and satisfying. Highly recommend this beautiful story!	2004-09-02

The crazy cop/good cop characters had me imagining Mel Gibson/ Danny Glover of the Lethal Weapon series. But Wick, the crazy cop, became more obnoxious as the story moved along that I didn't care what happened to him. (I couldn't imagine him being as likeable as Gibson would be) I loved the Rennie character, but hated how her storyline unfolded. The ending was a letdown. It really could have ended several more interesting ways. But, oh well.	2004-08-07

I think if you don't see Maggie (the protagonist) as the kind of heroine that you cheer for, the book is more enjoyable. Fiona, the daughter-in-law, to me, was the key character who seemed to speak for the reader. I would love to read a sequel to this, but I'll have to settle for reading another Tyler book. No problem, she's my favorite. Five stars for Tyler, easy four stars for this particular story.	2004-08-07

I can see why he sells a lot of books, he ropes you in right from the start with a mysterious death, a creepy old southern mansion, and before you know it you've turned 400 pages. I found this book easy to follow though I did feel that the story bogged down a few times in the middle, but good reading across the board. Solid enough to have me looking for another Grisham novel to knock off.	2004-07-24

Ms. Morrison's writing sometimes comes across like complex artwork, I enjoyed re-reading certain passages for their beauty and eloquence. The character Sula's dialogue after returning to town was the highlight for me. The exchange with Eva and later with Nel had me  riveted on each sentence. Friendship it turned out was the main theme, and the ending I'm not ashamed to say, produced some unexpected tears from this reader. For that achievement alone, I'll give it 5 stars.	2004-07-22

This was my first Patterson novel, and I thought it was entertaining, and very suspenseful right till the end. THEN I read the reviews!
