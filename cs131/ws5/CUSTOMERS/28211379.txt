Brion Gysin's book of drugs, magic and the Desert is part fantasy, part memoir, and part guidebook. The reader may find it mystifying and confusing at first read, and it's certainly not a straightfoward story in the conventional sense. There are many twists in this fictional tale of Ulys O. Hanson of Ithaca College, not the least of which is the thinly-veiled life story of Gysin himself as he discovers and embraces the music and culture of the Sahara.<br /><br />\\"The Process\\" is a book about journeys, and of becoming, with the Desert serving as Gysin's grand metaphor. The novel itself moves from west to east -- it begins with a quote from Shakespeare  and ends with an epilogue from Kashf Ul-Haqa'iq, a 13th-century Persian mystic. The story also gains centifugal force as it spins around the rituals and music of Morocco's master musicians of Jajouka. Late in the novel Gysin/Hanson speaks it plainly: \\"You see what I'm getting at, don't you? We are, all of us here, in an extreme situation -- between birth and death, you agree?\\" Seldom does a novel put the life force itself at center-stage.<br /><br />The book is full of secrets (in one aspect its Gysin's own diary of actual people and events) but it is also a manual filled with answers. The novel is indeed trippy, but in the grandest sense; and like life itself \\"The Process\\" is full of marvellous confusion, contradiction and not a little pain. The promise of Othello's \\"round unvarnished tale,\\" at the novel's beginning, gives way to Ul-Haqa'iq's \\"unveiling of realities.\\" At journey's end, of course, there is always the question all of us will face: \\"Why were you in such a hurry to get here, when the Desert gets us all in the end?\\" Highly recommended.	2005-04-11

It's hard to imagine those grizzled rock gods The Stones as having once been young, loud and snotty, but here's the proof in 175 oversized, black-and-white pages from the collection of the band's premier photographer Michael Cooper (in 1967, Cooper also guided the creation of the cover for \\"Their Satanic Majesties' Request\\"). The book is laced with witty and acerbic comments from the usual suspects: Keith, number one fan Terry Southern, Anita Pallenberg, and Marianne Faithfull all have wonderfully catty things to say (sometimes about each other ...) and there are some beautiful, ghostly images of Gram Parsons  with the band at Joshua Tree, looking for UFOs. Really.<br /><br />Cooper documented the Stones at a time when their bad-boy image could be enhanced by a single shot of Keith and Brian flipping off a picture of Richard Nixon, which says more about the \\"generation gap\\" than a thousand words ever can. This needs to be re-printed. (Another great photo book, \\"The Rolling Stones On Tour,\\" with pictures from the 1975 Tour of the Americas, was re-published this year in a deluxe edition.) Pick this up while you can. Turns out the old gods had time on their side, after all.	2005-04-07

As he imagines it, Paris' old, crumbling Beat Hotel is now run as a bardo by Buddhist monks, a physical manifestation of the spiritual stages in which individuals have the opportunity to achieve enlightenment. The story and its' characters move upward, from first-floor room to ascending floors, and Gysin's fantasia weaves East and West together, fusing  hallucinatory tales of sexual debauchery, ancient myth, and the Word. The story is dense with literary allusion and wordplay; there are scraps of poetry, fiction, and scripture of all kinds on every page. The Dalai Lama, Apollo, Hassan-i-Sabbah and Gertrude Stein all make appearances in this cultural approximation of Gysin's literary cut-up style, and along the way there's a money-mad rock-star simian named Mickey Monkey whose father may or may not be William Burroughs. (Quoting one of Burroughs' more famous observations in the text, \\"you have to take a broad, general view of things\\").<br /><br />The novel is an edited version of a larger manuscript Gysin intended to call \\"Beat Museum-Bardo Hotel,\\" which remains unpublished. What's presented here is, still, a literary tour-de-force. It's Gysin's valedictory, and at the end the author himself seems tired of life's own pyrotechnics: \\"A story like this can have no happy ending,\\" he writes. \\"Or can it?\\" This may not be every reader's idea of an inspirational message, but for Brion Gysin it was enough.	2005-03-18

A genuine literary anarchist with a wicked wit and an incredible eye for detail -- his Esquire piece on the Chicago Democratic Convention in 1968 is classic eyewitness journalism -- Southern was also a screenwriter (Kubrick's \\"Dr. Strangelove\\"), a satirist, and an agent provocateur who relished goading people into revealing their true personalities. Along the way, poor E.B. White of The New Yorker comes out the worse for Terry's over-the-top interogration techniques, I'm afraid.<br /><br />Fueled by booze, pills and powders, Southern swings through the decades not just as an observer but a participant at the center of it all (writer for National Lampoon and SNL, pals with Lennon, the Stones and Burroughs, as well as Kubrick and George Plimpton). It seems there's hardly a scene he doesn't make, including an appearance on the cover of \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\" The book is filled with newly discovered bits of weirdness -- a lost scene for Kubrick's 1980 draft of \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" then called \\"Rhapsody,\\" an outrageous SNL sketch idea taken from National Enquirer called \\"Worm Ball Man,\\" incendiary letters sent to the editors of Ms. Magazine, and a pitch to Lenny Bruce for a part in Southern's adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's \\"The Loved One\\" in 1964.<br /><br />It's easy to romanticize (and criticize) the alcohol and drug-taking frenzy of so much of Southern's work, yet the sheer variety of it all (of which this book is just a part) is amazing, not to mention the amount of \\"quality lit\\" he produced. Thanks to Nile Southern and everyone involved in bringing this compilation to print.	2005-03-10

There are no photographs,  but the intricate line drawings and intimate descriptions of functional households  -- kitchens and cooking utensils, washing areas, sleeping quarters -- are minutely detailed and thoroughly described in the text.

This combination proved so successful that, by the early 1930s, a conservative religious movement emerged with an aim to \\"clean up\\" Hollywood's excesses, led by the Catholic Church but supported by preachers, ministers, and spiritual spokesmen nationwide. The Catholic Church's League of Decency became the first cultural crusade against what was perceived as a threat to the national character. Wielding an authority of equal parts religion and politics, the League saw to it that movies were banned outright, content was snipped and clipped, and production scripts were combed over for hints of immorality. Classic novels were re-written for the screen to pass the scrutiny of the hastily-created, reactionary Hays Office. Is this a good thing? There was a backlash among Hollywood writers; Black's recounting of William Faulkner creating the story of \\"Sanctuary\\" in three weeks (\\"the most horrific tale\\" Faukner could imagine, Black writes, \\"a morbid tale of rape, murder, sexual impotence and perversion\\") certainly seems like an outright challenge to the Paramount studio writers and censors, and the rewritten, completed film (\\"The Story of Temple Drake\\") turns the story inside out for a relatively less-scandalous ending.<br /><br />Over the course of years, the Legion of Decency and the Hays Office's Production Code (which functioned as a presumptive industry watchdog) ensured that onscreen crime would not pay and immorality would be punished. Realism in Hollywood films got bleached out, but as the book makes clear the industry preferered to deal with religious moralists, and to police themselves with a nebulous code, rather than face government interference. In that regard America hasn't come very far, as the religious right's contemporary battles over entertainment and  the morality of content in movies, TV, and the internet make clear.

Bergman's look at the themes and ideas expressed in over 100 Depression-era films (gangster movies, comedies, Broadway revues, musicals, serious dramas) is more of a broad overview than an in-depth examination, but he does a good job explaining the industry's role in overcoming the country's deepening crisis. At the same time the industry itself was facing opposition from \\"moral guardians\\" to emphasize all-American values, Hollywood's expansive gloss on the American dream reassured uncertain and nervous audiences. The basic values expressed in many 1930s films (hard work overcomes all obsticles for the itinerant and the socialite alike, issues of class aside) reflected a basic trust in the American political and social system, which was being threatened from abroad as well as from within. Although Bergman's slim book is not essential reading, it is entertaining, and good historical background for many lesser-viewed (and lesser-known) films.	2005-03-04

Griffith meets Andy Griffith (and the Coen brothers)	This is a well-researched look at Hollywood's never-ending fascination with moonshine, country bumpkins, and what goes on up there in the hills beyond Beverly. In the early 1920s as more people moved to the cities, Hollywood found it could make money telling audiences about the places they'd left behind. Lurid tales of sex and debauchery, such as 1950's \\"Tobacco Road,\\" undercut the good-hearted goofiness of the Ma and Pa Kettle series of the 1940s. By the 1990s, the Coen brothers' \\"Raising Arizona\\" was a hit on the strength of Nicolas Cage's ironic portrayal of a lovable yokel (an updated edition of this book would have to include the current TV show \\"My Name Is Earl,\\" proving this archetype isn't dead by a long shot).<br /><br />Williamson covers a lot of ground here, from \\"The Andy Griffith Show\\" to John Boorman's \\"Deliverance,\\" and his conclusions are fairly broad ones. His best writing narrows focus on a specific film or theme: the on-location making of the log-cabin potboiler \\"Stark Love\\" (1926) is wildly detailed, with newspaper reporting and interviews with local extras who made appearances in the film as members of an \\"authentic\\" mountain family.  Lots of movie stills, contemporary cartoons, and detailed captions accompany the text. At times the book reads like a college course -- Williamson is a professor at Appalachian State University in North Carolina, and acknowledges the input of several students -- but for film buffs and general readers, \\"Hillbillyland\\" is an entertaining  look at how the film industry exploits one facet of American culture.<br /><br />For more about \\"Hillbillyland,\\" visit BellemeadeBooks at Blogger.com	2005-03-02

Rock'n'roll is fifty years old now, and it shows no signs of slowing down, going away, or even turning off that darn racket. The five lengthy essays in this book discuss many of the elements that have contributed to its longevity: the taboos of sexuality and race, the roles played by radio and tv, how the music now dominates the commercial marketplace (and has been turned into a commodity itself), why it still carries the sense of teenage rebellion.  While anyone who listens to Sting may take exception to that last statement, it's certainly true that rap and pop are still being influenced by rock'n'roll forms and formulas.  These essays are a bit dated (the book was published in 1988) but they're detailed and thoughtful, informative without being critical of the pop marketing elements that were shaping the rise of MTV.  This is a good companion to Frith's 1981 book, \\"Sound Effects: Youth, Leisure, and the Politics of Rock'n'Roll,\\" which examines the spectacular growth of the recording industry in the 1950s and 1960s, and the identification of a youth culture that followed it.	2004-10-12

Martha Bayles doesn't care much for the twelve-tone scale or the 20th-century European composers (and she's not very fond of amplification either -- watch out, Leo Fender, you're next!). In the best tradition of American Bandstand, it's gotta have a beat or Martha's not dancin' to it. While most readers of \\"Hole In Our Soul\\" would probably agree with Martha's basic premise that genuine art trumps artifice for authenticity, her argument that popular culture has been ruined by the artist's need to shock us is less secure. (Artists have been trying to surprise people since -- well, Martha herself traces it back to cultured, classic-rocker Apollo and unruly, shock-rocker Dionysus).<br /><br />Once her subjective, conservative-values discussion is opened, Bayles's book becomes a game of line-in the sand: what is genuine music, as opposed to the merely popular?  Many artists neatly sidestep this issue by being simply great: Scott Joplin's syncopated rags were outrageous to some, and also became extremely popular. Great art and music still finds its audience, regardless of how many people hooted during Stravinsky's \\"The Rite of Spring\\" in 1914. Her dismissal of European high culture and its ruinous effects on rock'n'roll reads like a misguided attack on dead white males: say hello to Kurt Cobain, unacknowledged-European-influenced art-rocker.<br /><br />  What Martha tends to miss here is the role of technology. The spread of \\"popular\\" culture continues to be a result of advertising, mass-marketing, and improvements in reproduction techniques like 45-rpm singles and vinyl albums in the 50s or compact discs in the 80s. (Though the book was written before music downloads, it's a bet that Ms. Bayles would find that innovation degrades recorded music even further by making it too ubiquitous.) Previously, it was sales by popular artists that subsidized the older, back catalogue of pop and classical recordings that would otherwise be unavailable. Today, everything seems available on the internet, while behind the scenes the music industry battles over ownership and royalty issues.<br /><br />Conservative theories like Bayles's always presume some golden era when things were more balanced, more \\"correct,\\" but this balance never really existed. Popular culture is always a jumble of influences. (It does seem miraculous, though, when you hear a great song on the radio; no matter what your \\"pop\\" standard, from Gershwin to the Beatles to Beyonce, it makes every song around it sound like junk).  In the best oral tradition you can hope that Bob Dylan (or in Martha's case, Robert Johnson) is your next door neighbor and can pop in to sing you a song. Most of us aren't that lucky to live on Mount Olympus. I agree that some popular music can be art, but the business of popular music is sales. That makes everything beyond the song itself -- the recording of it, the marketing, the weekly sales chart -- the artificial, \\"popular\\" part.nternet, while behind the scenes the music industry battles over ownership and royalty issues.

Just one look at the titles in this eye-popping collection of essays, photos, and illustrations, published in 1968, indicates, really, that bad taste knows no bounds. \\"Death,\\" \\"Christian kitsch,\\" \\"Tourism and nature,\\" \\"Politics,\\"  and \\"Pornokitsch and morals\\" are just a few of the topics surveyed by then-contemporary writers and critics. Also included is Clement Greenberg's essay \\"The Avant-Garde and Kitsch,\\" published originally in 1939, tracing the rise of art in the service of totalitarian regimes.<br /><br />The book was first published in Italy and many of the photographs and illustrations are from European sources, but anyone who thinks of The Lone Ranger when listening to \\"The William Tell Overture\\" has been influenced by kitsch.  Some of the academic essays have not aged well, even if  the gently tortured Italian-into-English translation has its own charm: \\"And obviously before long (and even now in fact) we will witness the anti-family kitsch, the kitsch of hippies and long-haired youths, the kitsch of addicts and beatniks\\" -- foretelling Nirvana's cover version of Bowie's \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" by a good 20 years! Fascinating, funny, and full of hideously bad art, this book is a wonderland of the high-brow, the low-brow, and the no-brow of taste.

The \\"Tour of the Americas\\" was a huge and extravagant undertaking (elephants! giant stages! inflatable props! Andy Warhol!) that set standards for stadium shows, both on and off the stage, and the 12-inch-square format of this book almost matches the flash and excitement of the live events themselves. Rolling Stone magazine photographers Annie Leibowitz and Christopher Sykes capture the larger-than-life Stones onstage in big, color close-ups, as well as the private moments in hotel rooms and backstage in black-and-white candid shots. Accompanied by daily jottings from Terry Southern -- himself even then a living legend -- and a brief note from Mick Jagger, the book is a great, oversized memento of rock in the mid-70s. Yeah, of course it's flashy and druggy, overstuffed and even (depending on your viewpoint) bloated and verging on self-parody -- and by the end of 1975 the Ramones were blasting a hole in the ozone over CBGB's. Yet the Stones are still here, and still touring, more of an industry than a rock band by now.  If these pictures are anything to go by, the old saying is true: what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. Amazing -- and shouldn't it be time for a reprint?	2004-10-04

Victor Bockris has written a witty, detailed story full of the band's personal turmoil, drug use, and ego-fueled confrontations, focusing on the art of the music and the band's struggle for commercial success in equal measure. It's filled with great black-and-white photographs that capture a band as interested in its own look as its music.

Ferlinghetti, by far, takes the longest view of events past and present, and suggests solutions (some new, some old), sounding the most conservative by comparison.

The stories of life on the road, the \\"cutting contests\\" of musicians trying to outdo one another off the bandstand, and the personal stories of struggle and discrimination, bring the era to life in a way that no scholarly book can match.

Paytress captures the excitement developing in 1960s Britain as the mod scene sweeps Mark Feld -- a sometime photo model and guitar-strumming minstrel with an obsession for Dylan and Donovan -- into the role of a self-made rock'n'roll icon. It's not a smooth transition. Often ignored and put-down in his earliest efforts, Bolan eventually finds success through the support of radio maverick John Peel; his subsequent rise to stardom, fame, and the eventual excesses that lead to failure is the stuff of countless rock biographies. What sets Paytress's book apart from the usual sad story is Bolan's star-making drive -- first as a brash upstart and self-promoter, then as a performer whose real talent lay in crafting the perfect three-minute pop song. The book goes a great way to renovating Bolan's tarnished image as a 70s rock'n'roll curiosity, and while his work may not be the equal of his contemprary David Bowie, Bolan was as much a craftsman in image and music as Ziggy himself. Paytress writes the T Rex story with a blast of glam energy from start to finish.	2004-06-01

From the earliest, it is obvious that Patti's a romantic mythmaker at heart, with syntax and meaning almost losing out to the sheer power and rhythm of the word. It's difficult to read her lyrics without hearing the rock'n'roll that carried them aloft. Patti's subject matter on the earliest albums -- art, drugs, and mysticism in full romantic swoon -- she delivered with nearly Biblical passion. Her lyric styles and confessional soul-searching owe a debt to Jim Morrison, which Patti has always acknowledged, and the power of Patti's words (like Morrison's) is often in their performance and not on the printed page. Her fans will appreciate having a written record of Patti's earliest lyrics, but the simply curious may not be converted.	2004-06-01

It's a real labor of love, as these two musicians -- one east coast, one west coast -- have a great respect for each other. Vega, one-half of the electronic music duo Suicide (with Martin Rev), has an extremely dark vision of life in the city; his lyrics are grim but not without hope, and descriptive without being judgemental. His art, quick and sketchy, is an effort to translate that urban feel into black-and-white. The result looks sloppy, rushed, and incomplete, as if the next thought might complete the picture; but there's no resolution, just pieces of the puzzle. &quot;Cripple Nation&quot; is not a book for the faint-of-heart, or whose sensibilities lay in admiration of pretty pictures. Vega has been making challenging art for thirty years, and this book is no exception.	2004-06-01

It's as far-ranging a collection as Snyder's lifelong interests -- the &quot;real work&quot; of living, creating, and conserving, the connection between spirituality and what Snyder calls &quot;the bioregional ethic.&quot; For more formal essays on the individual's role in conservation, Snyder's 1990 book, &quot;The Practice of the Wild,&quot; continues many of the themes explored in &quot;The Real Work.&quot;	2004-05-28

What Cash describes is what made the South unique to begin with -- its blend of agrarian culture, 18th century British cavalier society, and Scottish individualism. As Cash writes, \\"the Southern world, you will remember, was basically an extremely uncomplex, unvaried and unchanging one.\\" How the South approached the complexities of the modern era, and dealt with the ideas of industrialization and multiculturalism, is not his focus. Certainly the book should be read in the context of its times (America had yet to enter World War II) and with the realization that much has changed since then. His book is not an apology, nor is he blind to the clash of racial and social issues that the Civil War and subsequent Reconstruction left unresolved, either. The fact that Cash's work has been vilified and re-evaluated over many years, even by the reviews here, is an indication that the concepts and issues he described more than sixty years ago are still debated today -- a true picture of the mind of the South in the 21st century.	2004-05-27

Here, together in one volume, are excerpts from his most important writings. \\"To Master, A Long Goodnight\\" (a biography of the man who was the basis for Harriet Beecher Stowe's anti-slavery classic \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\"), published in 1946, is included along with his script for Burroughs's \\"Naked Lunch,\\" written in the 1970s. There's a revealing selection of his cut-ups (\\"The Third Mind,\\" a Burroughs collaboration); songs, set to music scores by Steve Lacy; as well as gallery notes and art from the 1960s. There are also five chapters from \\"The Process,\\" the novel that synthesized much of Gysin's philosophy of belief, magic, art, and drugs in the service of self-discovery. Editor Jason Weiss has done a terrific job linking these disparate sources into a coherent whole without leaving the first-time reader feeling as though he were on a guided tour. The book is a great starting point for anyone interested in learning more about the roots of the beat generation.	2004-05-27

Dressing as a man, she traveled through Saharan Africa and drowned -- in the desert -- at age 27, which only emphasizes the uniqueness of the written record she left behind. Unlike the works of other desert adventurers such as Sir Richard Burton and T. E. Lawrence, Eberhardt's diary never clarifies why she endured these hardships, or why her life was such a complex tangle that there was an attempt on her life shortly before she drowned. Her unsettling story of gender deception, unaccompanied travel in Islamic society, and unresolved death is so far out of cultural norms that her story is seldom told, and makes this diary all the more intriguing.	2004-05-27

Each successive &quot;gin law&quot; ensured that some would profit from the taxation and regulation of Mother Geneva, while at the same time gaining political capital from the prosecution of demon alcohol.  Warner also describes the parallels between past and present, especially those presented as &quot;victims&quot; of drug wars -- the unwed mother, the unemployable addict -- whose problems lay far outside the realm of the political or the ability to be helped by these laws. An essential book to the understanding of how drugs affect the individual and society at large.	2004-05-26

By looking at the settings, theory, and practice of drug use through the 17th-19th centuries, Hayter provides historical context to an otherwise loosely-grouped list of writers: the careers of DeQuincey, Poe, and Baudelaire are examined in detail as well as lesser lights such as Francis Thompson and Wilkie Collins. Published in 1968 when interest in the culture of drugs, its uses and effects were at a peak (and when the very words \\"drug culture\\" meant different things to different people) this book is certainly an artifact of the period, but Hayter's research is thorough enough to remain an excellent source of material, as well as debate, on the value of drug use in art.<br /><br />For more about \\"Opium and the Romantic Imagination\\" visit BellemeadeBooks at Blogger.com	2004-05-26

The influence of this experimental community continues to the present (the faculty and alumni included Anna and Josef Albers, Charles Olson, Robert Creeley, and Jonathan Williams, among many others). The struggle to keep the College fiscally solvent from year-to-year, as often happens at any instution, becomes paramount to the story, but doesn't detract from the intellectual achievement of Black Mountain -- or diminish the artistic clashes of its participants. In the 1970s, the founding of the Naropa Institute, the Jack Kerouac School of Disemobodied Poetics, and other experiments in community would find echoes in the history of Black Mountain College. This is an entertaining and informative history, and essential reading for anyone interested in mid-20th century literature and art.	2004-05-25

In the character of Alan Severance is the thinly-veiled personality of the poet himself, self-deprecating and perfectionist, attempting to overcome despair in a hospitalized addict's routine of recognition and confrontation. It is by no means an uplifting triumph to acknowledge that he got this far in the struggle -- but that he got this far, and then despaired, says much about the power of alcohol to ruin even the power of hope. This novel will change any romantic notions the reader may have about art and the role of drugs in the life of any artist.	2004-05-25

In this 1960s experiment, of course, these three patients have been diagnosed with a proven pathology. In society at large most of us seek out friends and associates with whom we share a great deal; yet our sense of personality is still a matter of individual choices. At end, this was the same discovery Rokeach made with his three Christs; when confronted with the truth, these three men made personal choices allowing for the existence of the others -- a society of Christs. I first read this in the early 1970s as part of an anthropology course, and although I am not a health care professional I found it a fascinating study, one that carries the reader with an almost novel-like flow. For those who read it with care, it will provoke a lot of questions about what makes us who we are, both as individuals and as members of society.  A fictional parallel to many of the ideas in this book, though by no means exact, can be found in Nigel Dennis's 1955 novel \\"Cards of Identity.\\"	2004-05-25

This colorful memoir -- one of the first in America to treat the issue of alcohol abuse -- was written to encourage the prohibition efforts of the Women's Christian Temperance Union. London does condemn the overuse of alcohol, but his barroom tales make an equally strong case for its allure. The emphasis London places on the reasons why people drink, and drink to excess, fills this book with exciting characters and locales -- \\"the cameraderie of drink\\" is London's own phrase, as another reviewer notes. This personal revelation by one of America's premier adventure writers must have been shocking to a nation that viewed its drunks with a fairly tolerant eye. It is certainly an important book for those interested in the literature of alcohol abuse in this country.	2004-05-25

This is the book which introduced me to Williams (for a time, the photograph of Little Enis on the cover had me convinced the title of this book was &quot;Dancing Nightly&quot;) and his publishing venture, the Jargon Society. Williams is like a neighbor who comes to call with the most astounding stories: it's up to the reader to judge for himself the validity of Williams's claims to art, but his revelations are so entertaining that you can spend hours in JW's pleasant company. The Jargon Society was the original publisher of &quot;White Trash Cooking,&quot; and, like that volume, &quot;Elite/Elate Poems&quot; describes an astonishing world that, for better or worse, is disappearing from the American scene.	2004-05-24

In these 40 essays, some published for the first time, Williams champions the reader as well as the writer, the artist and the tinkerer, the big idea and the passing fancy. What brings them all together is JW's unflagging faith in the individual; his enthusiasm for the regional writers and artists he celebrates (many published for the first time through the Jargon Society) is a joy to read. Sadly, the number of memorials included here (Joel Oppenheimer, James Loughlin, Robert Duncan, among many others) indicates a wealth of talent that is quickly passing; and, as Williams himself notes, the number of \\"85 genuine poetry readers sounds much too high to me.\\" Still he persists, and continues to promote and publish. The wellspring of American creativity is a self-renewing resource, even as JW echoes Walter Lowenfels: \\"One reader is a miracle; two, a mass movement.\\" This book is a welcome and needed collection of Williams's wry commentary.	2004-05-20

He finds new targets for his obsessions (the accomplished author Edmund Wilson, primarily), and by trying to make art of his life, he makes a disjointed mess of a novel instead. \\"Last Notes From Home,\\" the final volume, demonstrates he could pull out of his personal tailspin; there are some genuinely funny moments, and that final book is much more focused. Reading this is like looking through the wrong end of a telescope -- Exley misses the big picture as his universe becomes smaller and smaller.	2004-05-20
