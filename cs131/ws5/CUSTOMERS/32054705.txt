The living rooms were a bit<br />overdone,especially having lace doilies on the backs of furni-<br />ture.

Coping has been defined as the ability to deal with a situation.Trying to cope with pain,suffering,and disability creates emotional distress-the daily life of a person with RSDS.<br />Fortunately, the internet is bring patients closer and people are demanding attention and a cure...

One of the Master bedrooms proves it.Even<br />the little touches of the hat boxes reflects the beauty of blue<br />and white.<br /> The idea is to show white as a color and it does.It shows the<br />stark drama of black and white tile.Floral arrangements are better perceived against white,witness a multi-colored bridal bouquet.Interspersed on many pages are the gorgeous white picture frames that are subtly placed throughout the<br />book that are finally in fashion again.I love to just<br />look at this book.	2003-05-29
