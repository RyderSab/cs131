The big things for space opera are done well:  nice battle scenes, clever ideas, decent villains (though to be honest, the Naxids are not terribly interesting; the bad \\"good guys\\" are the source of fun and gnashing teeth).  The writing is not as fine as in Williams' short stories (or in his best novels), but it's always readable and more than competent. <br /> <br />The characters are well drawn, and the nature of the characters makes this more interesting than typical good \\"interstellar shoot-'em-up\\" fare -- there's some irony, tragedy, and ambiguity to the (otherwise a bit traditional) ending -- it's not perfectly clear where some of Williams' sympathies lie, and that's a good thing. <br /> <br />Recommended to anyone who likes enjoyable non-slide-rule-bound science fiction, but doesn't demand High Literature.	2005-10-03

It's good Wolfe, and really little more needs to be said.  Gene Wolfe is one of the finest writers alive, and this is a wonderful book.<br />Is THE KNIGHT great fun, full of battles, giants, dragons, fey creatures, and magic?  It is.  Those seeking a fun high-fantasy story with an engaging narrator won't be disappointed.<br />However, the usual puzzles, tricks, possible obfuscation and lovely (though usually simple in this case) use of language that readers expect from Wolfe are also present.  The events are in plain sight, without any obvious BOOK OF THE NEW SUN-like elisions, but the meanings have not yet emerged. There's a kind tribute to Poul Anderson, some clever use of the Lindsay/Eddison \\"narrator from our world\\" approach, and so forth.<br />This is a welcome present to long-time Wolfe fans, and not a bad starting place for new Wolfe readers, though the long wait until THE WIZARD arrives makes THE BOOK OF THE NEW SUN a possibly better choice.	2003-12-23

AIDING AND ABETTING isn't one of her very best novels (of her more recent books I prefer REALITY AND DREAMS, although AIDING AND ABETTING is far superior to SYMPOSIUM), but it's still a very good book.<br />As one reviewer below notes, a curious doubling is one of the tropes of this book--mistaken and overlapping identities mask, I suspect, a concern with lack of identity.  Spark handles her various themes with her usual grace, wit, and, most importantly, economy.  This book is 166 pages, and Spark uses every one of them well (even when she tells us something twice, we can be sure it is for a good reason).<br />One final note:  AIDING AND ABETTING and DECLARE make for interesting comparison.  I have no idea whether Muriel Spark and Tim Powers have much overlap in audience, but perhaps they should.  They write very different books, but these two show an interesting coincidence of subject matter.  Powers and Spark investigate the possibilities of infamous British aristocrats, in Powers' case Kim Philby, and in Spark's Lord Lucan.  The Burgess and Maclean case comes up in both books, and the idea of the decaying English aristocracy as letting them and Lucan escape in a fit of apathy, disbelief, class loyalty, and moral paralysis is important to both writers' aims.  Spark conjures up a future for Lucan while Powers' fantasy of history &quot;explains&quot; Philby and indeed the entire Cold War.  Doubling, noted above as key to Spark's book, is equally important to Powers, on a more fantastic level.  In the end, they take different approaches:  Powers' Philby is fascinating, complex, sad and deservedly damned; Spark's Lucan is a study in the banality and triviality of evil.  There is mystery, but Lucan is too small to be of great interest to his own story.	2001-04-02

It is not so here, even if it is true elsewhere.  Gene Wolfe is still making labyrinths, it is true, but at the center is heartbreak, and wonder; and, most importantly, love.  The narrator of the three volumes of THE BOOK OF THE SHORT SUN is that rarest of literary creations:  a beautifully good man.  The maze we travel to reach him is built of wisdom, joy, and pain.<br />Plot summaries appear above, and in the inner jacket of RETURN TO THE WHORL.  They are fairly useless.  Surely no one will read this who has not read ON BLUE'S WATERS and IN GREEN'S JUNGLES, and those who have will know some of what is to come.  The rest should be a surprise and a revelation, although the bald statement of &quot;what happens&quot; does not begin to unfold the greatness of this book.  Suffice it to say that the search for Silk begun in the first volume continues, and the parallel lines of narration draw to their close--old friends are met again, and new ones are made.  The truth is told, and told well.<br />There are now twelve volumes in the SUN series.  This is very possibly the best of them.  Together, they make up one of the most extraordinary artistic creations of our time, and I would not hesitate to claim for them a high place in the literature that does not concern itself with any one age.  That we are alive to welcome its arrival, and to express our gratitude to Gene Wolfe for having given it to us, is surely not the least of the blessings we have received from the Outsider.	2001-01-28
US	50890892	R1FYPIYNJU2BN9	1573928526	226229829	From the Wandering Jew to William F. Buckley, Jr. : On Science, Literature, and Religion	Books	4	20	26	N	N	For Gardner Fans (and a Caveat)	If you haven't read anything by Martin Gardner, I'm not sure this is the best book to start with.  Gardner's been doing this for a long time now, and his earlier works are more fresh.  There's a sense of retreading familliar ground here.  I would propose either one of his Mathematical Recreations collections (if you are interested in that side of Gardner's work) or the essay collection _The Night is Large_ as a starting point.  That said, this covers varied ground, occasionally overdoing the skewering of an idea that is, to anyone likely to read Gardner, going to be fairly easily dismissed, and occasionally showing naivete (a la Carl Sagan) in its manner of demolishing pseudoscience.  Gardner is no born again Scientific Materialist, like Sagan, but he can sometimes display the same flaws.<br />Which brings me to the last essay in the book, the review of William F. Buckley, Jr.'s _Nearer, My God_.  Gardner respects Buckley, despite strong disagreements with him on varied topics, and the review, as such, is certainly positive:  &quot;I put down 'Nearer, My God' with unbounded admiration for Buckley's courage and honesty and the depth of his piety.&quot;  However, the bulk of the article is a rambling account of time-worn criticisms of Christianity that Gardner suggests Buckley has answered with willful ignorance.  The problem isn't that the criticisms are uninteresting (one of them is the problem of evil, another the difference between the Old Testament God and the New Testament God that so moved the Gnostics).  It's hard to imagine that Buckley could have written a book that answered all of them, and presumably Buckley is as aware of them as the next highly educated and supremely literate Catholic--I suspect (he hints as much in his reply to Gardner, included here) that Buckley would refer Martin Gardner to some of the thinkers Gardner and Buckley mention--Augustine, Aquinas, etc.<br />The chief problem with the essay is that when it comes to religious matters, Gardner, despite a great admiration for Chesterton and a good deal of knowledge, has a strangely Protestant approach to matters, and tends to judge Catholic thought as if sola scriptura had been the cry not of Luther but of the Church.  In particular, although it is hard for me to imagine that the widely read Martin Gardner isn't aware of Newman's ideas on the development of doctrine and the Church's position that tradition, rather than simply the texts of the canon and the Church Fathers, serves a role in this development.  Gardner seems to think that the writings of Aquinas are all formally proclaimed doctrine and that doctrines historically present but not written by the earliest fathers are inventions.  This overly text-based approach might be a legitimate weapon to use against a Protestant Church proclaiming itself to be based purely on early texts, but it is not very useful in discussing a Church that claims to develop (not invent) doctrine under the continued guidance of an acting Spirit.<br />This point aside, the book is certainly worth reading if you've enjoyed Martin Gardner's writings in the past.	2001-01-16

Some Wolfe fans find the Long Sun books disappointing. At first glance, the writing doesn't seem to be of the same beauty and complexity as that in the books narrated by Severian; the philosophical and metaphysical insights here seem less breathtaking. However, this is a Gene Wolfe novel, so appearances are expected to be deceiving. Patera Silk alone is worth the price of admission, and the plot of Long Sun is Wolfe's best yet, intimately connected to the presentation of the varied and fascinating cast of characters. THE BOOK OF THE LONG SUN rewards rereading perhaps even more than most of Wolfe's work.<br />It is nice that all four volumes of this series are back in print.  THE BOOK OF THE SHORT SUN, now two-thirds complete, may be Wolfe's best work to date (high praise indeed), and THE BOOK OF THE LONG SUN should be read before beginning on SHORT SUN.	2000-11-19

He is among the most inventive, clever, even seductive, makers of alien worlds ever to grace the genres of science fiction and fantasy; and THE DYING EARTH, his first novel, is his most evocative, haunting, and powerful work.  Long out of print, that short book is one of the central influences on modern science fiction, and the favorite book of many readers.  In his BOOK OF THE NEW SUN, Gene Wolfe writes of a &quot;Book of Gold&quot; used by librarians to lure children to their calling; Wolfe states that for him, the &quot;Book of Gold&quot; that captivated him forever in the world of letters was THE DYING EARTH.  Elegaic, rich, and filled with wonders and visions you will never forget, THE DYING EARTH along justifies purchasing this collection.<br />The volume, however, contains not just one indescribably good book, but three other novels set in the same impossibly distant and strange future.  THE EYES OF THE OVERWORLD is highly entertaining and contains some of Vance's best dialogue (and one of the best endings in recent literature).  CUGEL'S SAGA further follows the rogue Cugel, and RHIALTO THE MARVELOUS is the (presumably) final story set on Vance's red-sunned future Earth.<br />Taken together, these four books are as good a reading value as you're likely to find anywhere this year, or for many years to come.  Every serious reader of science fiction should own these books, of course, but everyone who enjoys wonder, mystery, and beauty should read them.	2000-11-10

Whatever else he is, he is a lot of fun.  THE BALLAD OF PECKHAM RYE lacks the sympathetic, possibly autobiographical central character found in many Spark novels (THE COMFORTERS, THE BACHELORS, etc.); however, it doens't fall into the black hole that swallows THE DRIVER'S SEAT or other works consumed by Spark's sense of evil.  Instead, Dougal Douglas, the ever-present mischief-maker, takes the place of the sympathetic center.  He wreaks havoc, but only by bringing out the devil in others--he himself has a kind of curious innocence in the midst of their scheming and violence, and acts as a (presumable) spokesman for Spark when he categorizes their various moralities (Functional, Emotional, Puritanical and Christian).<br />Such a summary doesn't begin to capture the delight and wit of one of Spark's most enjoyable and economical (again, not a page too long, which cannot be said for many of even our best writers today) books.	2000-10-10

THE MOVING TOYSHOP is the only one commonly found in bookstores  and is (rightly) considered a classic of the genre.  However, for my money,  BURIED FOR PLEASURE is the best of the Fen mysteries.  It's certainly the  funniest, with priceless bits including one of literature's best hauntings  and a most memorable pig.  <br />Gervase Fen's non-campaign for parliament  isn't just insanely funny--it also includes some very intelligent insight  into the political process, and reminds us that a great deal of good sense  underlies a comic approach to many things.  This is one of the best  detective novels ever written.	2000-08-03

This is the first Nero Wolfe mystery--the characters aren't quite  settled down into their comfortable places yet (and some of the members of  the cast haven't appeared on stage yet--Lily Rowan doesn't appear until  SOME BURIED CAESAR, perhaps my personal favorite of the series), and the  mystery isn't Stout's best.  However, Nero and Archie are there, and the  sheer joy of listening to them and following Archie's narration are in full  bloom.  There is no particular reason to start with FER-DE-LANCE, but it's  not a bad way to begin one of the most pleasureable creations (the series  in full) of the 20th century.	2000-07-27

Fortunately, what's here is entertaining and worth reading.   The mood here is similar to that in the PEREGRINE books, although  considerably less playful: eclectic fantasy, portentious hints of things to  come, interesting characters, and Davidson's offbeat  erudition.<br />Davidson's &quot;false starts&quot; are certainly better  reading than much &quot;finished&quot; fantasy published each year.	2000-07-24

TIME AND THE GODS is probably his single best work, and all of the stories from that long out-of-print masterpiece are to be  found here.  This should be enough to persuade Dunsany enthusiasts in favor  of this volume.<br />For those who haven't read Dunsany, he is one of  fantasy's true masters; many have imitated his archaic, elaborate style,  but none have succeeded in capturing the peculiar Dunsany magic without  being artificial.  Dunsany's strange meditations on time, destiny,  prophecy, and fate are reminiscent of Borges, and his prose is rich and (as  noted) perilous to imitate.<br />S. T. Joshi's introduction somehow makes it  seem as if Dunsany's chief merit were his influence on Lovecraft, but it is  more correct to say that Lovecraft's chief merit is his influence on  others, while Dunsany remains a neglected literary master, one of the few  writers ever to capture wonder and mystery at their most elemental in  wrappings of elaborate, aristocratic prose.	2000-07-21

If you haven't read AFUtD, I suggest that you do so--but only because it is a very fine book, not because it is  necessary in order to enjoy A DEEPNESS IN THE SKY.<br />Vinge's talent for  grand scope and the orchestration of events is at its best here--over the  years, Vinge has improved about as much as any writer I can think of, and  he started as a fairly talented storyteller.<br />I can't tell you the best  things about this book; there are surprises and twists here that are  meticulously established but stunning when they come nonetheless.  Vinge's  aliens are very nicely realized and contain a miniature homage to science  fiction in disguise, I believe.  His talent for characterization has  improved to the point that he can make a fairly abstract moral dilemma (and  goals that at first glance seem megalomanical) gripping and intense--in a  dazzling array of scientific pyrotechnics and political machinations he  makes a single man's struggle for his soul the compelling center of the  action, and it isn't the (too often see) false human interest inserted to  keep the non-techophiles reading.<br />All in all, A DEEPNESS IN THE SKY is  one of the year's best science fiction novels, and probably destined to  become an enduring classic of the genre.	2000-07-20

This second volume continues the narration of the quest to recover Silk.<br />Lupine surprises and unanswered(?)  questions abound, and to discuss the events relayed in this middle volume  would be to spoil the joy of discovery for other readers--besides, until  the final volume is published and we've reread the whole thing a few times,  we probably won't fully know the story.  Wolfe's work, like life and unlike  so much fiction, grows richer with each return; like old friends, his  novels reward attention and familliarity breeds delight rather than  contempt (born out of boredom).<br />The manner in which the story is  presented is, as in ON BLUE'S WATERS, complex even for Wolfe--multiple time  frames and threads of narrative are blended expertly.  The way Wolfe works  his magic through the guise of a &quot;rambling&quot; and  &quot;unskilled&quot; narrator is truly beautiful.  One of the best things  about this book is its extended use of a device employed with great skill  in THE CITADEL OF THE AUTARCH:  Wolfe transforms what might be an artifical  narrative technique into a moving commmentary on that most fundamental of  human activities, the telling of a story.<br />For, in the end, it isn't the  brilliant prose or the narrative genius that makes this a great work.   Rather, it is the moving, wise, and loving exploration of what it means to  live and love, to feel the immense pain of consciousness and to do good and  evil that justifies the elaborate machinery--to tell a lie beautifully is  unfortunate, but to tell the truth with skill and beauty is to achieve  greatness.	2000-07-20

A. Lafferty, however, is breathtakingly different.  I  can guarantee that you haven't seen the world the way Lafferty does--and  you'll enjoy the experience.<br />THE DEVIL IS DEAD is some of his best  writing and most inventive strangeness.  Sure, the plot doesn't really (I  think) go anywhere, but recursive endings and silly loops are welcome any  time they come packaged in this delightful and enlightening a read, with  such a motely crew of Lafferty outlaws, drunks, monsters and sailors.  The  Promantia alone is worth the price of admission.  If you want a book that's  hilarious, deep, wise, frightening and beautiful, look no further.  If you  want a conventional plot or tidy resolution, look elsewhere.	2000-07-19

The individual stories are very good, some (such as  &quot;Brain Fever Season&quot;) are extraordinary, as good as anything  Lafferty has written, and full of the wonder and wisdom of his weird, wooly  way of looking at the world.  However, some are pretty mediocre for  Lafferty--but they are rescued by the format; the stories that don't work  as stories work as chapters in a very strange novel about Austro and  company.<br />All in all, a book that every Lafferty fan should give a try  (and certainly every Lafferty fan should read at least some of these  stories) but not a good place for a Lafferty neophyte to start.	2000-07-19

Reith is one of Vance's most likable protagonists, and (unlike some other still fine  works) here Vance manages to keep the plot rolling and eventually gives us  a satisfying ending.<br />The real treat, though, is the trip through Vance's  exotic, mad, philosophical alien and human cultures, and the marvelous  soundtrack of Vancean dialogue.  Vance's imaginative power and polished  prose is backed up genuine insight--for instance, the power structure on  Tschai is complex enough to be plausible, and the equation is not strictly  one of &quot;scientific/military might = real power.&quot;  Reith, in many  ways the archetypal SF &quot;man of action&quot; is not without an  introspective side, and admits &quot;Logic doesn't always work,&quot; while  remaining an eminently reasonable man.<br />It's very rare to get this much  entertainment out of 500 pages.

NINE HUNDRED GRANDMOTHERS is his best  single collection, one of the true landmark collections of modern fiction.  It's amazing that such a wonderful collection hasn't had more influence,  but then again it's hard to imagine anyone else writing anything even  remotely like a Lafferty story except as a pastiche or tribute.

Newman is also  careful to point out that the liberal arts and even theology may attempt to  establish a single, inadequate framework for the discovery of  truth.<br />Newman's complex epistemology does not fall prey to the heresy  that truth is not one, but reminds us that in our present state, truth  present various aspects and that the tyranny of any particular branch of  knowledge is the victory of ignorance.	2000-07-18

THE DRIVER'S SEAT,  for instance, is overwhelmed by this malevolence--it is an excellent  nightmare, but has only small moments of the Spark charm.<br />THE BACHELORS  has a lot of both--the &quot;medium&quot; Patrick is one of Spark's most  chilling portraits of evil.  The scheming Spiritualists resemble more  typical Spark &quot;villains&quot; (like the literary circle in LOITERING  WITH INTENT), but are perhaps even more harmless in and of themselves.   However, unwittingly they touch on something far grimmer--Spark demolishes  the Spiritualists by showing that the only thing worse than their nonsense  is when they stumble upon something genuine.<br />The &quot;good&quot;  bachelors' interactions with this group provide an entertaining and equally  true view of things, preventing the chill from permeating the book.	2000-07-14

The difference here is that the &quot;authority&quot; of Miss Brodie from the first novel is missing, and the girls are a little more  grown up; the world around them has grown grimmer--there's the blitz and  the prospect of Labour victory...<br />Spark always manages to create great  entertainment out of a profound, humane, and sympathetic but iron-willed  moral judgment, and THE GIRLS OF SLENDER MEANS is no exception.  Its  particular merit is that it evokes a time and place in a nostalgic but  unsentimental manner better than most of her works.	2000-07-14

SCOOP is one of his most hilarious, making great comic  fodder of the pretensions of journalism, politics, and England.  One  remarkable thing about Waugh is that he is a biting satirist who doesn't  seem to dislike even the targets he attacks most ruthlessly--they remain  humans rather than straw men, which makes the point better than any mere  caricature could possibly manage.	2000-07-14

The intrustion of the &quot;literary device&quot; is marvelous because it is anything but a gimmick.  For one thing, the mysterious metafictional  typewriter (from an author composing a novel you might be reading) is  inspired by experiences Spark describes in her autobiography.  Aural  hallucinations contributed to two masterpieces of English prose around this  time--Evelyn Waugh's THE ORDEAL OF GILBERT PINFOLD takes a different  approach, less cosmic and perhaps more comic.   In both cases, however, the  voices are central to the novel, and provide a marvelous opportunity for  conveying a unique (and, I think, in both cases, -true-) view of our  world.<br />The other undercurrent here is Spark's conversion to Roman  Catholicism.  Caroline's attitude may not be Spark's, but I hope it  is--skewering irritating modern Pharisees inside the Church as gleefully as  those outside of it.	2000-07-14

The swashbuckling story combines zany adventure, a constant skewering of  Chesterton's favorite targets (most of these targets endure to our day  under different names, so the battle is well worth re-fighting), a number  of the usual red-headed suspects, two throw-away romances, and a diabolical  insane asylum that calls to mind C. S. Lewis' Objective Room (only  Chesterton has more fun with it).  Those who complain about the ending  should remember that Chesterton is simply too big-hearted to damn a  character he likes (he might consign the Superman to Hell, of course).	2000-07-06

You would expect THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE to be pretty good.   Certainly the concept (alternate history Victoriana with Babbage's machine  a reality) is fertile.  Sterling and Gibson did their homework (almost too  well--the references to Disraeli's books are likely to fall very flat for  most readers).  The prose is nothing special, but is certainly  readable.<br />And yet the novel doesn't hold together.  It's difficult to put  a finger on just what's wrong with THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE.  The ending is  both weak and contrived, but that isn't really the fatal flaw.  Somehow, a  lot of inventive sound and clever fury adds up to nothing much, and even  leaves a slightly distasteful sensation in the reader's mind.<br />Read  Gibson's NEUROMANCER, or pretty much anything by Sterling, and you'll be  much better off than you will be reading this book.	2000-07-05

Johnson,  of course, is one of those rare characters who demonstrates that life is  not necessarily less rich than fiction, and Boswell is an entertaining (and  amusingly exasperating) chronicler.  The &quot;Journal of a Tour to the  Hebrides&quot; is also well worth reading and randomly  revisiting.<br />However, I'm somewhat alarmed by the comments below about the  accuracy of this version.  I bought this because it was a decent-looking  hardback version--I had actually read a library copy (some long  out-of-print edition).  Could some reviewer please explain the deviations?

My lack of language skills prevents me from embarking on an experiment.<br />At any rate, it may not matter.  The English translation is one of the most powerful,  beautiful, astounding works of literature of the last century.  Because  every novel is, in a sense, a memory made concrete (that the memory is of  fictional events is no matter), memory itself is a wonderful subject for  fiction--in a sense, when an author takes memory (or time, because in life  they are inevitably interwoven, indistinguishable perhaps) for his theme,  as Proust does, he embraces all of experienced reality as his subject  matter.  Through memory, Proust manages to convey the actual texture of  experience, and the truth of the insights makes the constant recursive  analysis of motive, perception, and the act of remembering anything but  tedious.<br />On another level, Nabokov's insight that the great writers are  fantasists, creators of worlds, and master illusionists is on display  here--forget, for a moment, how accurately and profoundly Proust captures  what it is like to be alive.  His creations, perhaps transfigured from his  real life, are glorious and &quot;better than life.&quot;  The Baron,  Odette, Swann, Bergotte, Elstir, Bloch, &quot;Rachel when from the  Lord&quot;, Albertine, the woman at the WC, and the whole population of  this other reality are an improvement on, if not reality, at least out dim  perception of it.  Is there in life such an &quot;invert&quot; as the  Baron, or has there been such a Baron?<br />And, slow-paced as they are, the  events also are wonders and marvels--the Arabian Nights are a recurring  subject of the narrator's wondering mind, for good reason--the stories here  are as nested and impossible as those of the Thousand Nights and a Night.   Paris in the early parts of the last century is as strange and eternal as  the City of Brass or Baghdad of old--and some of the musings of the  narrator in Venice suggest even stranger cities, the territory just east of  Borges.<br />To enter the pages of these (this) seven (one) novels (novel) is  to enter an enchanted realm, and to return ensorcelled forever, carrying  the suspicion that the world around us may also be magical and true and  impossible as well.	2000-06-09

As usual, Spark takes the material of  life and, well, to put it bluntly, she improves upon it.  Of course, this  is the task of the true artist, but Spark doesn't soften the blow of  discovering just how disordered and unsavory real-life often is--as when  she is dispatching her characters to their various fates, she is sharp,  sympathetic, and economical.  The perfect necessity of every word is the  key, I think to Spark's novels.<br />Literary blathering aside, this is also  one of Muriel Spark's funniest books, which makes it doubly wonderful.	2000-05-31

Here a mysterious voice (God?  Death?  the author?) admonishes a set of alternately charming and despicable souls:  &quot;Remember, you  must die.&quot;  Spark is a better novelist than Evelyn Waugh because,  while Waugh is often more riotously funny than the ever-subtle Spark, Waugh  focuses more on the foibles of the moment--some of his characters will be  (though still entertaining) &quot;dated&quot; by the middle of the next  century, one suspects.  Spark, however, through her tiny intrustions into  fictional reality (the voices here, the typewriter in THE COMFORTERS, etc.)  enlarges her scope--so long as people die and don't want to think about  that fact, MOMENTO MORI will be on target.  It is curious that it is the  women--Flannery O'Connor and Muriel Spark--who are strong enough to  emphasize in the theology of their fiction the &quot;terrible swiftness of  mercy,&quot; the sheer audacity of the Holy Spirit, as it were.  Spark is  not only one of the best novelists of our century--she is very likely the  most economical.  MOMENTO MORI is one of her best.  Spark says more in a  little over 200 pages than many novelists manage to say in a lifetime of  long novels.	2000-05-26

This novel is no exception.  As usual, artistry and creation are  central themes, but for Spark they are natural themes, and connected to a  startling and authoritative view of reality as an artwork, of God as the  truly capable artist and artificer.  Spark's characters are always  deliciously alive, often malicious, always charming or repulsive as need  be; Tom is one of Spark's best male characters--appearing in a role often  reserved for a possibly autobiographical female character.

At first glance, the writing doesn't seem to be of the same beauty and complexity as that in the books narrated by Severian; the philosophical and metaphysical insights  here seem less breathtaking.  However, this is a Gene Wolfe novel, so  appearances are expected to be deceiving.  Patera Silk alone is worth the  price of admission, and the plot of Long Sun is Wolfe's best yet,  intimately connected to the presentation of the varied and fascinating cast  of characters.

This is Wolfe at his finest, and  Wolfe at his finest is as good as it gets.  PEACE is also an excellent  introduction to Wolfe, for those daunted by THE BOOK OF THE NEW SUN.  The  only better introduction, in my opinion, is the equally touching and  marvelous THE FIFTH HEAD OF CERBERUS, which may especially be preferable  for long-time readers of science-fiction.	2000-05-25

Just who he really _is_ remains a tantalizing mystery at the end of this first volume of Wolfe's Book of the Short Sun.  Read New Sun and  Long Sun before starting this trilogy; that's my advice, though others  think it isn't essential (even if it isn't, why deny yourself the pleasure  of reading more work by Gene Wolfe?).  This new &quot;series&quot; (it's a  novel, of course, in parts) is good work, possibly better than Long Sun--ON  BLUE'S WATERS is some of Wolfe's finest writing since the first volume of  THE BOOK OF THE NEW SUN.  This (final?) trip to the Universe of the  Increate and the Outsider (which is, of course, our own universe, seen  through a mirror, brightly and darkly) promises to be a fitting  capstone--taken together, the various Sun Books are surely among the most  lovingly crafted and wisely conceived visions of man's place in the  universe ever devised.	2000-05-25

However, it is a touching comic masterpiece in its own right, suffused with Nabokov's priceless prose.  Pnin himself is  endearing, and the emotional core of PNIN is perhaps more accessible, less  disguised by cleverness and artifice than the humane sympathy in PALE FIRE  or LOLITA.

URTH OF THE  NEW SUN does more than simply show us what happens when Severian takes the  trip implied at the end of THE CITADEL OF THE AUTARCH.  It does not explain  away the mystery, but deepens it; it widens and deepens our understanding  of the universe of Wolfe's Sun Books, and warns us to (in Flannery  O'Connor's phrasing) beware of &quot;the swiftness of mercy&quot; and the  painful touch of Divine Grace.  Le Guin (who sometimes achieves the goal  herself, but not as often as Wolfe) is correct in calling Wolfe  science-fiction's Melville--not that Wolfe and Melville have the same  vision, but they share the ability to make the concrete things in their  fictional worlds embody ideas and truths without losing their  &quot;thingness&quot;--they escape the Scylla and Charybdis of fictional  idealism and materialism.  In Wolfe's case, I would call this  &quot;Incarnational&quot; fiction, grounded in his Catholic worldview, but  whatever perspective it comes from, it is worth seeking wherever it can be  found in literature.	2000-05-25

Clones, shapeshifters, colonized planets, genocide, &quot;uploaded&quot; intelligences, and the other SF tropes of this  masterfully interwoven set of three novellas are often-visited ground.  But  only Wolfe brings the intensity of vision and nuanced, complex, evocative,  winding prose of Proust, the nightmarish flagellation of the soul of Kafka,  the moral clarity and sympathy of, well, Gene Wolfe to bear--not so much  &quot;talking about&quot; these ideas as using these ideas to go deeper and  to examine the nature of identity, self, guilt and knowledge.  Wolfe is not  guilty, however, of the sin of using his created worlds merely as metaphors  for our current conditions; rather, Wolfe grounds his insights, which are  universal, in the concrete conditions of a fictional reality, as only the  best writers manage--to neither be idealistic nor materialist, but rather,  Incarnational.	2000-05-25
