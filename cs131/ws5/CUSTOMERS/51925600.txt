I'm glad they finally collected the chapters into one book. <BR>This book begins with the ending of the Earth-Romulan War, and the beginning of the United Federation of Planets. The main storyline is of six captains competing for the command of the U.S.S. Daedelus. Underscoring their competition are two factions who want to direct the future of Starfleet, one wanting it to be a purely military force, the second one for exploration and research. <BR>This was a very enjoyable book and a gutsy effort. Dont go into it with the thought it will mesh with Enterprise, because it wont. Thanks for MJF and Pocket for filling out an early portion of Star Trek history. I'd like to see even earlier novels based on the Earth-Romulan war, or a year two.	2002-02-27

The author gave me several sleepless nights as I adventured with his hero down to Peru to find an idol made from an extraterrestrial element that could be used to power the ultimate doomsday device. On the way we meet with rivaling U.S. armed forces groups, Nazi's, a doomsday cult, giant crocodiles and even larger jungle cats. This book is definately not to be missed! If you are an Indiana Jones fan you should definately pick this one up. A surprising second effort, I'm going to go back and pick up his first, if it is even half as good as this one it'll be better than most out there. Buy this book, you wont be disappointed!	2002-02-25

When the cover blurb admits \\"even legends must die\\" it isnt a good omen for the book. <BR>The Grey Death Legion is sacrificed one member at a time upon the altar of war, and at the books' end I wasnt sure why. Perhaps ..., to show no one is safe. The story is tight and well written, but very very depressing at the end. One can only hope that the Legion will share the fate of the phoenix and be reborn. But that doesnt even seem to be on the near horizon.<BR>Goodnight Grey Death Legion, my first initiation to the universe of Battletech, and long time companions on the road. It wont be the same without you.	2002-01-15

Although I thought the series had ended, and I have to backtrack to volume 4, it was easy to get involved with the story and old friends were easliy recoginzed.<BR> This time our pilots are on a bombing mission to take out Saddam. There are plenty of plot twists and turns as well as the great air to air and air to ground combat sequences.<BR> If you loved the last four..or are just a fan of fighter novels, this series is for you.<BR> Don't pass it up!	2001-08-20

While Kira is left on the station to do repairs from the Jemhadar assault, Bashir, Dax, Ro, and Taran'atar are sent to a planet in the badlands where a genetically enhanced human has found a Jemhadar cloning facility and is beginning to create his own army in the hopes of remaking the Federation in his own ideals. This leader believes himself to be the 24th century's answer to Khan Singh and takes his mantle upon himself. Section 31 believes the only way to stop one genetically enhanced human is to send another after him...ie.. Bashir. The plot is tight, characters true to the show..though most of the new ones still need more time to shine. A great book!	2001-06-30

There is just too much going on that isnt connected with the story. This is one book that didnt need a tie in with the Davion civil war, or the quick piece with the Black Dragons (yes they're back or will be). Too much was attempted too soon. A longer build up to the war between the Draconis Combine and the Ghost Bears would have been nice as well. We've heard about this in other books, but a fully fleshed out text would have been better. When I put the book down it left me unfulfilled. Battletech fans...better pick this one up though. With the sale of the Battletech property from FASA, this and the next one might be the last we see for some time.	2001-06-17

This first book in the Section 31 series is a well rounded read. It is more adult in nature than most of the novels to date. And noteworthy to say that there is the first ongoing ...relationship in Star Trek (I might be wrong on this.) I always wanted to know more about Lieutenant Hawk, I really wished he'd survived First Contact, and this book really flesh out a character that had promise. It is good to see that the pristine Federation has a dark underside. I'm looking forward to seeing more of it in the next three novels.	2001-05-31

I enjoyed his last two novels immensely and now he has taken a wonderful new step into the prequel time line. Reading this book, it really seems he has a handle on Senator Palpatine. If you were left wanting more of him (like I was) from the Phantom Menace, look no further. This book sets up the events of Episode 1 with Palpatine angling for the taxation of the outer rim trade routes on one hand and dealing with the Trade Federation on the other. Valorium is shown to be even more of Palpatine's target in this book. And Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan are well used, but the real strength in this story is the Senator who would be Emperor Palpatine. Star Wars fans...buy this one!	2001-05-31

I must say I love Pocket Books new daring take on the Star Trek  franchise. The New Earth series, Millenium, Gemworld, Dark Matters, and now the latest the Mirror Universe duology Dark Passions. This book is filled with many of beloved characters, but with a charming dark twist. Politics is the game of the day and the characters shine with all the double dealing going on behind the scenes. Intendant Kira shines as much in the novel as she did when Nana Visitor brought her to life on Deep Space Nine.  The story telling is tight, the characters believable, and my only complaint is that these two books should have been one novel, much like the SwordHunt duology should have been. Looking forward to book two!	2001-01-08

Ever since last year and the destruction of the Excalibur, I have been waiting to see the fate of Captain Calhoun, and it has finally arrived.<BR> Sorry Mr. David, but if this is the best you could come up with, perhaps we should have left him lost in space. The Calhoun storyline is an unabashed western and kept jarring me out from the very enjoyable parts of the book with Captain Shelby and her crew of the U.S.S. Exeter.<BR> I am glad that Calhoun and the Excalibur have returned, but I wish it had been with a better story line. Peter David is an excellent author, I have enjoyed his previous Star Trek and Babylon 5 novels, but I guess everyone comes up with a bad apple once in awhile.<BR> I am looking forward to the next set of adventures with Peter David, Calhoun and his crew. Just one note though, a year is too long between sets! How about a New Frontier novel once every three months instead of all at once?	2000-11-17

The second book of this trilogy keeps up the promise of the first as Chakotay and Tom Paris have been ripped away from their friends on Voyager and tossed onto a new planet. Their first contact with these people is harsh and painful, but plans are made to retrieve them by another possible set of allies.<BR> Back on Voyager, the crew is set forth by a higher evolved species to go and cleanse the Delta Quadrant of dark matter. Helped by the Romulan scientist and an alien that they found they begin to delve into the instrument they have been given and go forth on their quest.<BR> Poor Harry Kim takes it in the heart again when he falls in love with the new alien woman. Her society is technologically advanced and she wants nothing to do with natural things. Some of those things near and dear to Harry's heart.<BR> In the Alpha Quadrant, there is plenty of political intrique with the Romulan court and the head of the Tal Shiar.<BR> Once again, with this new setup of stories extending two or more novels, there is plenty to sink your teeth into. I find myself looking more and more for the next novel to come out. I can only hope that this new view extends into the new year!	2000-11-12

This volume was bittersweet at best, the story line was excellent, but if you are a B5 fan then you already know the outcome.<BR> What really drove the book for me was the last part, finding out exactly why John and Delenn were on Centauri Prime as was seen in &quot;War Without End&quot; and &quot;In The Beginning&quot;, and G'kar's reason for being there as well. The characters were true to the show, although the character of David Sheridan needed to be fleshed out more.<BR> Goodnight Londo and G'kar, may you be waiting with Sheridan, Lorien, and the rest for us to catch up with you out there... beyond the rim	2000-11-04

Maybe it is the restrictions of playing in someone else's sandbox, but there isnt enough to make you feel that the characters you are reading today will become those that come to life in Dune. Some situations, story lines seem to be just added for dramatic effect then thrown away without any remorse. I hope the series matures into something close to it's parent books and the writers find that sense of scale before tackling the last book after the prequels. Nice try but just no cigar.	2000-10-27

His new book is no different. It is good to see Walker Boh again, although his cat Rumor is greatly missed this time around, and the new cast of characters are wonderful to get to know.<BR> This journey takes the story out of the Four Lands and into new uncharted territory, as well as adding some well... science fiction or science fantasy aspects to the series. I was uncomfortable at first, but I trust Brooks to pull it off. This book suceeds at what a first novel is supposed to do, set up the conflict, introduce the characters and leave you wanting more. And with the events of the last page it certainly does!<BR> It will be too long til the next book comes around!	2000-09-27

Star Trek books usually are McDonalds for the mind, they are great while you are in the middle of them, but once it is gone that's it. Every once in a while a book will come out of the fold and grab me. This is one of those books. This story is filled with a disaster of galactic proportions, promising to threaten not only the Federation, but the Romulan Empire as well.<BR> Carol Marcus is kiddnapped, and six months later the Genesis wave begins to tear through an entire sector of the Federation. Leah Brahms is the only survivor on a planet remade by the wave and barely escapes the system's destruction with another person from her science station. On her way to inform the Federation, she runs into an old friend of ours, (no I'm not telling). Eventually running into the Geordi and the crew of the Enterprise E.<BR> The story is well crafted, the suspense keeps building, all the way til the final page....then you have to wait til April to finish the story. But as long as the second book is as good as the first I will be happy to wait.	2000-09-27

Will Murray has written an enjoyable romp with Nick Fury and his agents of  S.H.I.E.L.D. teaming up (albeit briefly) with their foes of Hydra to  prevent a madman bent on world destruction. Murray doesn't disappoint fans  with his characterizations of the main characters, and the many fun toys  that S.H.I.E.L.D. has at their fingertips. The beginning alone is straight  from a James Bond movie.<BR> I would love to see Murray return, I loved his  works on The Destroyer novel series and comics run, and very much enjoyed  the adventures of Nick Fury in this new millenium. If presented right, Fury  and S.H.I.E.L.D. could be the James Bond or Man from U.N.C.L.E.<BR> Nick  Fury fans, buy this book!

All plot lines are tied up (some unfortunately so), a new ship and crew take over from the Enterprise, and all is well.  All being well is the problem. I  dont know if this was set up to be a story on it's own, or a launch of yet  a new Star Trek series. As a finale it comes short of target, but works  great if it is an introductory tale of the Challenger and her crew. This  particular ship and crew I wouldnt mind seeing again, just like those of  the Excalibur. These new faces are fun, a refreshing change from the same  adventures of Kirk, Spock, and company. I hope a visit to the Sagitarius  cluster comes again soon.	2000-07-31

I loved the attention the author gave to each of his characters, good and bad. I literally read the book til I would  fall asleep with it in my hands each night. Unfortunately the story  stumbles at the end, as if the author wasnt sure how he wanted to tie it  up. A worthwhile reading attempt if you can deal with the lackluster  ending.	2000-07-31

The plot does seem recycled, but  it's a nice diversion from the &quot;got to save the planet&quot; theme of  the other two books.

Unfortunately Shatner and company have tried to tie almost everything that has happened  in the ST universe into one cosmic conspiracy. Captain Kirk should be  everyman, not a cosmic puppet or instrument of destiny. Ashes From Eden was  a great book, they have gone down hill from there. This book I have to say  will only appeal to ST fans, and the prior two books need to be read before  this one. I hope the next book about Kirk returns him to who and what he is  best, a Starfleet officer, a starship captain. That was his first, best  destiny.	2000-06-26

I love to read Stackpole's works in the Battletech or Star Wars universes. I am sorry to see him and his character Corran Horn depart. I hope the absence isn't too  long.<BR> Once again we are thrust into the conflict with the Vong. Getting  to learn who they are, what they believe, how they think, beginning to make  them three dimensional characters.<BR> Unlike in earlier novels until  Vector Prime, people die, people you get close too. This shows the truth  that this is war and no one is safe. It also shows, that no matter how hard  a hero tries, good intentions arent enough. Sometimes when you win, you  lose.<BR> Han and Leia were missed, but I am glad to see a new generation  taking up the fight, and new characters. The rebellion wasnt just Han,  Leia, and Luke, and I am glad to see stories that begin to focus on others  in this fight.<BR> A great book, come back to play soon Michael!

My disappointment was much like that of The Phantom Menace, &quot;I waited all  this time for that?&quot;  There is too much going on in this book, as one  reviewer said, it would have worked better as a trilogy. With the new  villan brought to justice and a full fledged wedding at the end. There is  alot to like in this novel, in fact any visit to the Eleven Kingdoms is  welcome, but it was just a let down towards the end. I gave this a four  star because there is no 3.5 or 3.75 and I feel the book deserves better  than just a flat 3.0. A good effort, just not her best.	2000-06-17
