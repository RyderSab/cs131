I finished \\"Watership Down\\" in awe of how well the story was written, wishing that the 400+ pages would have continued on to book two.  Alas, the story is self-sufficient, and another story would be but a shadow of this epic.<br /><br />We meet Hazel and his brother Fiver as the story begins.  We will soon learn that Hazel is quite intelligent and Fiver can foresee the future.  Both Hazel and Fiver are outskirters in Sandelford Warren, and the Owsla, which are the large rabbits of the ruling class, typically push Hazel and Fiver around.  However, there are strange things going on in the commons around Sandelford Warren, and Fiver senses that everyone must leave.  Hazel and Fiver go to see the Chief Rabbit and attempt to convince him that the warren is in danger, though Fiver is unable to explain the nature of the danger.  The Chief Rabbit does not believe Fiver's story, but Hazel is impressed with his brother's fear and decides that they must leave the warren.<br /><br />A small group of bucks, male rabbits, join Hazel and Fiver as they make their way into the unknown.  Fortunately for the group, Bigwig, a former member of the Sandelford Warren's Owsla, has decided to join them, along with several other members of the warren.  The journey to Watership Down is fraught with danger for the rabbits.  There are elil, which is what rabbits call all creatures that hunt rabbits, everywhere.  Yet, after a misadventure in an anarchistic warren where the rabbits are allowed to run free, but are harvested by a man, the Sandelford Warren rabbits make their way to Watership Down and build a new burrow.<br /><br />The warren at Watership Down has but one problem; there are no does.  A warren requires does to stay alive, and the rabbits go off to seek does from Efrafa, run by the dictatorial General Woundwort, and from Nuthanger Farm, where rabbits are kept in hutches.  It is the epic story of the encounters with the Efrafan rabbits and General Woundwort that will provide any reader with an excellent reading experience and make you wish for more as the last page lays flat.<br /><br />The story of the rabbits is well-written and has some factual basis.  Richard Adams credits R.M. Lockley's \\"The Private Life of a Rabbit\\" in his acknowledgement.  This highly imaginative tale of a group of rabbits is as riveting as any epic story in fantasy that I have ever read.  While I occasionally struggled with attempting to pronounce Lapine words that Mr. Adams created to describe the various aspects of rabbit life, in general this story was a relatively easy read.  Though I will admit to having first read the Lord of the Rings trilogy and \\"The Hobbit\\" when in middle school, I believe \\"Watership Down\\" is much easier to read, and thus may find an audience with children in elementary school with the vocabulary of this book.  I would feel quite comfortable having my children read this book as soon as they are capable of doing so.  The 400 plus pages of this book may seem daunting, but the payoff is an absorbing tale that will take a persistent reader to an excellently crafted ending, and make that reader long for more.<br /><br />\\"Watership Down\\" is one of those books that avid readers continually seek and all too rarely find.  The tale is original and nicely plotted.  The writing is clear and coherent, rich in details that will beg a reader to come back and discover after understanding the rabbits' future.

There were 33 books in this series, written between approximately 1953 and 1970.  This particular edition is the fourteenth book in the series, written by a man named Andrew E. Svenson in 1957.  Mr. Svenson was a ghostwriter for the Stratemeyer Syndicate with the fictional Jerry West receiving the credit.<br /><br />The Happy Hollisters are somewhat of a relic of an era gone by. The family consists of five children, Pete, Pam (Pamela), Ricky, Holly, and Sue, and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Hollister. There are also Zip, a collie, and White Nose, a cat, who has five kittens. Mr. Hollister runs a store called The Trading Post, which is similar to what was once called a general store in days gone by.<br /><br />Throughout the series the children solve mysteries, usually as a family.  The mystery in this story begins almost immediately.  The Trading Post is robbed.  About the time the store was robbed Mr. John Hollister was in the process of testing a new folding canoe.  When the Hollisters first discovered the store was robbed they suspected that the target of the robbery was the folding canoe.  However, they quickly discovered that one of the stolen items was a quantity of Geiger counters, used to located radioactive materials and the folding canoe prototype was fine.<br /><br />The Hollisters encounter a Mr. Tucker soon after the robbed.  Mr. Tucker offers the use of Spruce Forest, a preserve he owns.  The preserve is next to Fox Lake, and a river running from the lake has rapids suitable for testing the folding canoe.  Soon after Mr. Tucker offered the use of the preserve to the Hollister family the police discover clues that indicate the robbers may have headed to the same area!<br /><br />Once at Spruce Forest the family encounters signs that someone does not want them in the area.  A scarecrow placed at the entrance road warns the family to leave.  After the family sets up their camp and begins to explore they meet a boy who also warns them to leave.  Later they meet a man called Scarecrow who also warns them to leave.  It seems as though everyone in the woods wants the Hollister family to leave!<br /><br />As the mystery deepens, the family learns that someone may be impersonating a forest ranger.  They also learn of a boy and his father who have been missing for some time.  Yet more adventures wait as young Sue is swept into Fox Lake on a runaway raft, a bear threatens the children, and the people who warned the Hollisters to leave disappear.  As the book draws to an exciting end the Hollisters face a fire in the woods and a trio of dangerous criminals!<br /><br />Several of the more recent Happy Hollister books I was less than enthusiastic about.  However, I enjoyed this mystery thoroughly.  The story was nicely plotted and the action was brisk from beginning to end.  My only hesitation in recommending this book is that it is so good that many of the other stories suffer in comparison.  I am sure there are interesting anachronisms that I missed in this story, but the one that stood out the most is how one of the children is thrown out of the car as it goes into a ditch.  With modern shoulder harnesses and the diligence we use in wearing them, children should remain firmly within a car during an accident.  Please wear your seatbelts!<br /><br />The Happy Hollisters series remains a reasonably good, if somewhat outdated, read for younger children, perhaps from ages 4 to 9. I suspect that by age 9 most children are entranced by more modern pursuits. Also, many children may consider families of five children to be somewhat unusual and that may take some explaining. These books may be an excellent way to introduce children to the changes that have taken place in our society over the past half century.<br /><br />One last word of caution. These books are becoming very difficult to find, and thus their price varies substantially. If you are interested inreading this series you may find editions without covers that sell for less than editions with covers.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy The Happy Hollisters. They are a reminder of a simpler age that was only a short time ago.sell for less than editions with covers.     I hope you enjoy The Happy Hollisters.

There were 33 books in this series, written between approximately 1953 and 1970.  This particular edition is the thirteenth book in the series, written by a man named Andrew E. Svenson in 1957.  Mr. Svenson was a ghostwriter for the Stratemeyer Syndicate with the fictional Jerry West receiving the credit.<br /><br />The Happy Hollisters are somewhat of a relic of an era gone by. The family consists of five children, Pete, Pam (Pamela), Ricky, Holly, and Sue, and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Hollister. There are also Zip, a collie, and White Nose, a cat, who has five kittens. Mr. Hollister runs a store called The Trading Post, which is similar to what was once called a general store in days gone by.<br /><br />Throughout the series the children solve mysteries, usually as a family.  This story is similar to at least one earlier story in that it begins without a mystery.  When the Hollister family receives a gift of pineapples, a lizard shows up in the package.  Lizards are not particularly fond of cold weather, and it is winter in Shoreham, but fortunately the lizard does not need to remain in Shoreham very long.  A friend of Elaine Hollister (Mrs. Hollister), Grace Villamil, has come to Shoreham to visit with her children Carlos and Maya.  After a thoroughly enjoyable visit, she asks the Hollisters if they would like to come to Puerto Rico to visit her and her husband.<br /><br />When the family visits Puerto Rico they soon encounter a mystery.  A stone the children found on the Villamil's property seems to have some kind of writing on it.  The children learn that the writing may lead to a lost emerald crown.  Unfortunately, two criminals are also searching for the lost crown.<br /><br />The children begin their search, encountering the pair of criminals each step of the way.  However, with intelligence and luck the children manage to outwit the criminals.  Often the police nearly capture the criminals as well.  The story moves along steadily until the somewhat exciting conclusion where Pete and Carlos help capture the two criminals and the searchers learn the secret of the emerald crown!<br /><br />There are several points to make in this story.  First, we see the lizard, named Lucky, several times throughout the story.  Lucky seems to be a significant subplot.  I thought Lucky was a bit annoying, but younger children may find the thought of a lizard running about to be interesting.  At another point in the story, Pete nearly steps on a black spider that Carlos describes as being poisonous.  I believe that there are no poisonous species native to Puerto Rico.  Therefore, I believe the author was guessing that this tropical island had poisonous insects without doing the research necessary to prove that such insects actually exist.  Probably the most dangerous insect on Puerto Rico is the mosquito, known to carry a variety of diseases.  Last, a helicopter crashes into the sea and is flying again soon after.  It is possible that the helicopter might have flown again, but it seems somewhat unlikely.  The salt water of the sea would have gotten into the instruments, many of which would likely have needed replaced.  The engine would either have needed a major overhaul or would have needed replaced.  I think it might have been cheaper to buy another helicopter than to rescue the crashed helicopter.<br /><br />The Happy Hollisters series remains a reasonably good, if somewhat outdated, read for younger children, perhaps from ages 4 to 9. I suspect that by age 9 most children are entranced by more modern pursuits. Also, many children may consider families of five children to be somewhat unusual and that may take some explaining.

In quite a few books in this series Chet Morton's hobbies either are important to solving the mystery, or they lead to a mystery.  Such is the case in this story.  Chet is learning to become a ventriloquist, and he has saved enough money to purchase a dummy.  However, it appears that dummies are very popular and Chet has a difficult time buying one.  In a shop that has a dummy to sell, two men take a dummy that Chet is about to purchase at gunpoint!  Fortunately, the proprietor has another dummy in stock.<br /><br />Chet's dummy is damaged by accident, and suddenly the mystery becomes more complex when the boys discover raw diamonds in the dummy's glass eyes.  The mystery continues to increase in complexity and danger when an extra suitcase containing a bomb appears on the Hardys' new plane.  The boys also learn that the gang includes a member who looks a lot like Joe Hardy.  The resemblance between the criminal and Joe will cause Frank and Joe difficulties throughout this mystery.<br /><br />The mystery leads to Puerto Rico, where the boys encounter the criminals time and again, and yet seem to have difficulties learning what the criminals are up to, only that there is something sinister and complicated going on.  Eventually the boys travel to a remote island where the natives are clearly restless, and where the huge ghost of skeleton rock lives.  Soon after the story reaches its climax and the Hardys, Chet Morton and Tony Prito solve all the mysteries, including one involving a group of revolutionaries.<br /><br />I thought the most intriguing part of this story occurred early on, when Frank and Joe Hardy and Chet Morton were trying to figure out what was going on with the dummy and the diamonds.  After everyone went to Puerto Rico the story seemed to get a little weaker.  The story also dates itself because the story describes Carib Indians that appear to be living a very archaic life.  Given the size of the island and its location, it seems unlikely that the Indians were indeed Carib and it seems unlikely that they would still exist in the same condition today.<br /><br />I find myself conflicted about this Hardy Boys mystery.  The story had good portions, but there were also portions that left me wondering what the author was thinking.  I happened to be reading another book about Puerto Rico at about the same time, \\"The Happy Hollisters at Lizard Cove,\\" and I noticed the same lack of attention to detail.  While I am prepared to forgive a few errors, this time the author appeared lazy and that decreased my reading pleasure.  However, I am determined to read all the Hardy Boys books, regardless of their quality.  If I had the ability, I think I would have given this story three and a half stars.<br /><br />The publisher recommends the Hardy Boys series for ages 9 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14.  This particular book is a good fit for the new age range.  Though the Hardy Boys series contains archaic information, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are good.  Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading.he Indians were indeed Carib and it seems unlikely that they would still exist in the same condition today. <br /> <br />I find myself conflicted about this Hardy Boys mystery.

This story begins with a storm and a car wreck.  The man in the car is Tom King, identified as a Polynesian from the territory of Hawaii.  Since this book was written in 1956, Hawaii had yet to become a state.  I wonder whether Tom King is Polynesian or whether he was actually Hawaiian.  Tom King is seeking clues to the disappearance of the clipper ship Winged Chief.  If he can find the log from the ship, he can prove he is related to a wealthy cousin who passed away, leaving a fortune to anyone who can prove they are related.<br /><br />Soon after the Hollister children meet Tom King the shenanigans begin.  Tom King has valuable sketches of the Winged Chief that will help prove his identify.  The children make copies of the originals, which turns out to be fortunate because the originals are stolen.  Soon a pair of famous actors appears at the Hollister home, and suddenly the children find that they are going to be in a movie!<br /><br />The children travel to Boston and then Orient Harbor where the film is to be made.  Along the way the Hollister family encounters crooks several times without understanding what they want.  The children then learn that someone is trying to claim Tom King's inheritance, and he may have difficulty proving who he is because he lost the original sketches.

There were 33 books in this series, written between approximately 1953 and 1970.  This particular edition is the eleventh book in the series, and was written in 1955.<br /><br />The Happy Hollisters are somewhat of a relic of an era gone by. The family consists of five children, Pete, Pam (Pamela), Ricky, Holly, and Sue, and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Hollister. There are also Zip, a collie, and White Nose, a cat, who has five kittens. Mr. Hollister runs a store called The Trading Post, which is similar to what was once called a general store in days gone by.<br /><br />Throughout the series the children solve mysteries, usually as a family.  This story begins without any mystery.  The Hollister children's school is going to put on a fair to raise money for the Shoreham Day Nursery, which is a nursery for working mothers.  Readers need to recall that when this story was written it was more common for mothers to stay home with their children, or a relative such as a grandparent or older child would watch the children.<br /><br />The Hollister children soon befriend Jack and Jill Byrd.  Both children attend the Shoreham Day Nursery.  Later in the story we learn that Mrs. Byrd, the children's mother, lost her job.  Mrs. Byrd is a fragile woman and can take only jobs with minimal physical labor involved, so it is difficult for her to find a job.  Mrs. Byrd travels to seek help from her brother-in-law, Zack Byrd, who initially refuses her his assistance; more on this in a moment.<br /><br />Pete Hollister volunteers to find a merry-go-round to support the fund raising activities.  Eventually the Hollisters find not one, but two merry-go-rounds at the town where they once lived.  The owner is initially enthusiastic about supporting the children, and offers the merry-go-rounds without charge, but then someone tells the owner that the Hollisters plan to use the merry-go-rounds to make money.  After convincing the owner that they are going to be used for a charitable cause, the owner finally allows them to take the merry-go-rounds.<br /><br />It turns out that someone else also wants the merry-go-rounds, and will stop at nothing to get them.  The people trying to obtain the merry-go-rounds appear to have worked for Jumbo Carnival, which Zack Byrd partially owns!  There is an attempt to steal the merry-go-rounds as the Hollisters transport them to Shoreham.  Later, someone damages the booths at the school fair, even causing one to explode and catch on fire!<br /><br />The number of mysteries grows throughout the story.  By the time the story reaches its exciting climax, we are wondering who is trying to steal the merry-go-rounds.  We also need to learn whether Zack Byrd is behind the attempts to steal the merry-go-rounds.  What will happen to Mrs. Byrd and her children?  What about Joey Brill the bully, who seems to be involved any time something is damaged or sabotaged?  Is Joey involved once again?  These are but a few of the mysteries solved by the end of this exciting Happy Hollisters mystery.<br /><br />This Happy Hollister story is above average for the series.  Though there are a few implausible moments, and the story ends all too nicely with all the loose ends tied up, the story seems a good fit for younger children.  The differences between American society in the 1950s when this story was written and today make this story intriguing, as children see what life was like for their parents or grandparents and compare their parents or grandparents lives to what their life is like today.<br /><br />The Happy Hollisters series remains a reasonably good, if somewhat outdated, read for younger children, perhaps from ages 4 to 9. I suspect that by age 9 most children are entranced by more modern pursuits. Also, many children may consider families of five children to be somewhat unusual and that may take some explaining.

Frank and Joe Hardy and their friends Chet Morton and Tony Prito encounter numerous ruthless criminals.  The criminals are involved in scams, burglary, kidnapping, and even attempted murder!  The criminals in this story are among the most vicious the Hardys have ever met.<br /><br />The excitement begins immediately.  Frank and Joe are scuba diving when they encounter a diver with a deadly aim.  Frank and Joe escape, but their escape is narrow.  Soon afterward the boys encounter a man named Bowden who asks the boys to search for a cannon called a demiculverin.  As the boys search for the cannon they encounter others also looking for cannons and the others are very dangerous, injuring the boys and their friends more than once.<br /><br />As the investigation continues criminals break into a local museum and steal swords.  Unfortunately for the criminals the sword they really want is at the Hardy's home.  The crooks eventually get the sword through a clever ruse.<br /><br />The excitement heats up as the boys realize that Bowden may not be on the level.  One of the more interesting aspects of this story is the number of crooks involved.  We do not learn for sure who the good guys and the bad guys are until the very end of the story.<br /><br />One intriguing aspect of the story is the research the author performed relating to cannons.  The research appears to be accurate, based on a limited sampling on the internet, but the author had to do his research the good old-fashioned way, in the library.  The unfortunate side effect of this research is that the author uses the technical name for the various cannons more than once, and words like demiculverin tend to slow the story when used too often.<br /><br />This story seems to speed up as the story nears the end.  The danger increases, and one of the criminals destroys a valued possession.  Even as the Frank Hardy, Joe Hardy and Tony Prito try to keep from drowning, they still do not know whether the culprits are ready to pounce on the boys in the final exciting pages of this story.<br /><br />The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14.  This particular book is a good fit for both age ranges.  I think this Hardy Boys story is above average and I would recommend this story to a first time reader of the Hardy Boys.keep from drowning, they still do not know whether the culprits are ready to pounce on the boys in the final exciting pages of this story. <br /> <br />The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14.

The town of Shoreham was offering ten thousand dollars to the owner of the property on which Fort Freedom was located, and the Shoreham Eagle, the town newspaper, was offering an additional five hundred dollar reward.  Remember that when this story was written in 1955 that $10,000 was a substantial sum of money, enough to buy a nice house.<br /><br />The children learn of a clue involving Mr. Hiram Winthrop, who supposedly sent a letter to the Shoreham town council detailing the location before he died.  However, the letter never reached the town council.  The children find the letter with a little luck and clever deduction, but before they can deliver the letter Joey Brill, the town bully, steals the letter from them.<br /><br />The children are daunted for a short time, but then they continue to investigate possible locations for Fort Freedom.  The children soon meet men building a new highway through town, and a family being displaced by the new highway.  Someone begins to sabotage the construction equipment, blaming the damage on the family being displaced and the Hollisters!  The Hollister children believe that Joey Brill is involved somehow.<br /><br />The Hollisters also encounter a mysterious man who may be looking for the fort and its fabled treasure.  As the story proceeds the children find connections between Joey Brill and the mysterious man.  As the Hollister children encounter deadly dangers the excitement in this story builds.  Will the children discover the fort?  Who is the mystery man?  Is Joey Brill responsible for the sabotage to the construction equipment?  The reader will need to learn for themselves!<br /><br />This Happy Hollister story is a little above average for the series.  The lost fort seems plausible, along with the lost treasure.  When a bag of gold that has been buried for decades is picked up, however, the bag would disintegrate.  There are a few other discrepancies from current practice.  Children are never allowed near construction sites today.  Neither would anyone be permitted anywhere near a burning building, so a fight between two boys would never have allowed them to get close to a burning building.  But these differences are part of what makes this series so intriguing, as children see what life was like for their parents or grandparents and what life is like today.<br /><br />The Happy Hollisters series remains a reasonably good, if somewhat outdated, read for younger children, perhaps from ages 4 to 9. I suspect that by age 9 most children are entranced by more modern pursuits. Also, many children may consider families of five children to be somewhat unusual and that may take some explaining. These books may be an excellent way to introduce children to the changes that have taken place in our society over the past half century.<br /><br />One last word of caution. These books are becoming very difficult to find, and thus their price varies substantially.

There were 33 books in this series, written between approximately 1953 and 1970.  This particular edition is the eighth book in the series, and was written in 1955.<br /><br />The Happy Hollisters are somewhat of a relic of an era gone by. The family consists of five children, Pete, Pam (Pamela), Ricky, Holly, and Sue, and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Hollister. There are also Zip, a collie, and White Nose, a cat, who has five kittens. Mr. Hollister runs a store called The Trading Post, which is similar to what was once called a general store in days gone by.<br /><br />Throughout the series the children solve mysteries, usually as a family.  This time the children become involved with dognappers when they show their collie Zip in a dog show.  A dognapper steals a beautiful white poodle as the pet show is in progress.  Zip races after the thieves, but disappears in the distance as the crooks' car races away.  After placing an advertisement in the local paper someone calls the Hollisters to tell them that Zip wandered into her yard with a limp.  Zip has been found, but the criminals remain on the loose.<br /><br />Mr. Hollister must travel to Florida at a customer's request to view a houseboat for sail by a circus clown.  As the children fly to Florida they learn that a man with a box may have taken the plane and the box had holes in it as though it may have carried an animal!  As the children investigate further their suspicions seem to be confirmed.<br /><br />Once the children arrive in Florida they enjoy being on Circus Island, but the number of mysteries grows.  The owner of the houseboat is also part owner of Sunshine Circus, and he is selling his houseboat to get more money to keep his performers, who are being attracted to the Wizard Circus by promises of double the salary.  The children also meet another couple with a pair of poodles that are soon stolen.  Where are the dogs going?  The children also get to participate in the circus!<br /><br />When Holly and Ricky try to find shells for their mother they see a white poodle that they think has been stolen.  They children race after the dog only to see one of the thieves capture the dog again.  The children race into a swamp and become lost!<br /><br />This Happy Hollister story is about average for the series.  There was enough mystery to keep the story interesting, though I thought there were a couple of things that the author could have explained better at the end.  I was also surprised that the story referred to a woman having tamed an endangered whooping crane.  However, this story was written before our slightly more enlightened view towards extinction of species and some of the federal laws that protect those species.  Astute parents may wish to discuss some of the changes that have occurred since the time that this story was written.<br /><br />The Happy Hollisters series remains a reasonably good, if somewhat outdated, read for younger children, perhaps from ages 4 to 9.

Tony asks Frank and Joe Hardy to help him, and almost immediately the boys run afoul of a gang that attempts to frighten them into selling the collection, and when that does not work, they try to steal the collection.<br /><br />As the mystery progresses, Frank and Joe quickly learn that the criminals are after a set of medallions that may hold a clue to a fabulous treasure located in Central America.  Unfortunately, the boys do not have all the medallions and the lack may hamper their investigation.  In order to investigate the mystery further the boys travel to Guatemala, where their enemies and Mother Nature strike.  At one point in the story I wondered how the boys were going to escape lava.  Later the boys along with Tony Prito and Chet Morton are about to be thrown into a hidden tomb to die.<br /><br />While this story could have been fleshed out better, I still enjoyed it.  The action was nicely paced and I found myself speeding through the chapters to learn how the mystery ends.  While Frank, Joe, Tony and Chet violate more than a few modern rules of archeology, and while it would be unthinkable to provide them with a souvenir of what they find, if you can ignore the fantasy that they boys would even be allowed to dig at an archeological site without getting in trouble then this story turns out to be a page turner.  I consider this Hardy Boys story to be above average and I would recommend it to a first-time reader of the Hardy Boys series.<br /><br />The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14.  This particular book is a good fit for both age ranges.  This book contains a number of problems regarding how the boys are so readily able to travel in certain areas of Guatemala and then excavate an archeological ruin.  Today there are areas of Guatemala that are considered unsafe for foreigners, and I believe excavation of archeological ruins is very tightly regulated.  However, in the fantasy world of Frank and Joe Hardy, who perpetually remain the same age, perhaps the actions they take are reasonable.  Perhaps there should be a caution in the new editions:  Do not try this in real life.are so readily able to travel in certain areas of Guatemala and then excavate an archeological ruin.

This time the mystery involves their teacher Miss Nelson and her brother Traver Nelson.  When the Hollister children's school starts a pet club, the children notice that each time huskies or sled dogs are mentioned that Miss Nelson become sad.  Eventually the children learn that Miss Nelson's brother is missing.<br /><br />The children also watch a television show where they glimpse their grandparents.  In the same show they see a beautiful dog named Fluff fall during a sled race.  Much later the children learn that Fluff belonged to Miss Nelson's brother.  The children also learn that Fluff fell because someone deliberately caused Fluff to fall.<br /><br />After watching the show the children ask if they can travel to Canada to visit their grandparents at Snowflake Camp, which their grandparents operate.  As happens so often in this series, events happen that allow the children to leave school during a big dog sled race near Thanksgiving.  The Hollister family is able to stay at Snowflake Camp because of a last minute cancellation, which makes their trip more enjoyable since they are able to be close to their grandparents.<br /><br />While at Snowflake Camp the children learn that Traver Nelson's disappearance is a big mystery, and the same dog sled race in which Fluff fell is about to be held again.  The puppies of the winning dog are highly valued by the Mounties, so winning the race is very important.  But where is Traver?  Two men are also looking for Traver, and the men appear to be untrustworthy.<br /><br />How will this mystery end?  Will Traver be found?  Will Fluff have a chance to redeem herself in the next dog sled race?  What about the two sinister-looking men?  Will they be thwarted in their attempts to steal Fluff?  Will the Hollisters be able to overcome the difficulties thrown in their path and change these adversities to advantages?  You will have to read this book to find out!<br /><br />While portions of this book were even more coincidental than usual, I enjoyed this book.  There was a good mystery and I enjoyed the trip to Canada.  Dog sled races are still held in Canada and the puppies of winning dogs are highly valued.  Places like Snowflake Camp still exist.  One portion of this story also features a one-room school house heated by coal.

However, the boys are not sure why Mr. Ghapur sent the falcon to them.  Soon Mr. Ghapur and Mr. Bhagnav, both from India, visit the Hardys and explain that they were representing Satish Nayyar.  Mr. Nayyar's son, Tava, was traveling to the United States to complete his education.  However, Tava disappeared.  Shortly after his disappearance a ransom demand for rubies was received.  Frank and Joe advise their visitors that the peregrine falcon had already brought down a pigeon carrying rubies.  Their astounded visitors consider that the rubies might be part of the ransom payment.<br /><br />Several attempts are made to slow the Hardys in their investigation.  Someone attempts to steal the falcon.  The boathouse where their boat, the Sleuth, is kept is burned.  Their house is bombed.  Clearly the kidnappers are ruthless.  Frank and Joe slowly work their way through the clues, coming close and closer to the base of the kidnappers and hopefully the location of Tava Nayyar.  As the mystery nears the end, upstanding citizens turn out to be criminals, and the discovery of Tava yields even more surprises.<br /><br />I was somewhat disappointed in the previous book in this series, \\"The Yellow Feather Mystery,\\" and hoped that this book would be an improvement.  Fortunately, this book was much more interesting than the previous book.  I enjoyed the chapters involving the falcon, which appeared to me to be generally factual.  I also enjoyed the use of the falcon to bring down pigeons smuggling rubies.  While the mystery was plotted in a straightforward way from the beginning to the end, I found the mystery sufficiently intriguing that I zipped through this book quickly.  This story is above average and I would recommend it to a first-time reader of the Hardy Boys series.<br /><br />The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14.

Greg wants the Hardy boys' help in searching for his grandfather's will, which is missing.  Greg expected to inherit Woodson Academy, but his grandfather's unexpected death in combination with the missing will has left his inheritance in doubt.  Part of the confusion comes from Henry Kurt, who is the temporary headmaster of Woodson Academy.  Kurt insists that he will inherit Woodson Academy.<br /><br />The boys agree to help Greg, and visit Woodson Academy, where the soon run into difficulties with Benny Tass.  It often seems that every time the boys run into problems with their investigation that Bennie is involved.  The boys later discover that there is some kind of relationship between Tass and Kurt, though they have yet to discover what that relationship is.<br /><br />As the boys continue their investigation into the mystery of the will, they soon encounter evidence that someone else is searching for the will.  That someone goes by the name of the Yellow Feather!  Just who is the Yellow Feather?  Greg Woodson's grandfather had promised to tell him about the Yellow Feather, but died before he could pass the information along.  In spite of Frank and Joe's usual care, they are knocked unconscious without warning more than once in this story.  Clearly their enemies are playing for keeps!  As the tension in this story mounts, the Hardy boys are sealed inside a huge snow fort with no way to escape.<br /><br />As usual, Chet Morton is instrumental in this tale.  This time Chet has a unique sort of air propelled snowmobile.  Frank and Joe use this unique device when their car is disabled.  Chet also helps rescue the Hardys from the snow fort and serves as the temporary cook for Woodson Academy.  Whatever would the Hardys do without Chet?<br /><br />There are some interesting places in this book.  However, I struggled to keep interested in this story.  The pacing is a bit slow in some places and the story of Yellow Feather had little appeal to me.  When the true nature of Yellow Feather was finally revealed I think I was relieved that the story was nearly over.  While I am glad that I read the story, this story is one of my least favorite Hardy Boys stories.  I will recommend it to hardcore Hardy Boys fans, but if you are looking for a place to start reading the series, I recommend you start with the beginning of the series.<br /><br />The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14.

When the Hollisters purchase a used book at a library fundraiser they get more than just a book, they get a note written in Chinese.  The Hollisters soon encounter a man calling himself Hong Yee who wants the book.  However, the Hollisters are suspicious and refuse to sell the book to him.  After the Hollisters investigate the note further they learn that the note contains a hidden message, a message that takes the Hollisters to New York City.<br /><br />Once in New York, the Hollisters immediately have an adventure as the helicopter taking them downtown crashes onto the roof of a building.  The mystery deepens when they meet the son of the man that wrote the note.  The trail leads to the former house of the note writer, and the children learn about the tunnels beneath New York City; those that are official, and those that were for various private purposes.  The Hollisters face a dangerous man and his henchman, and they may be lucky to escape this tale without any harm.<br /><br />I generally enjoy the Happy Hollister series of books.  However, this story was less exciting than the previous stories.  There were places that I was actually somewhat bored.  While the Hollister stories always have this air of otherworldly innocence, this story tries too hard to be relevant, and I found the innocence of the Hollisters a little bizarre.<br /><br />I mentioned previously that 1959 was somewhat important.  The Soviet Union launched Sputnik in 1957.  This book contains a reference to a remote controlled rocket that circles a moon as a toy.  The archaic reference to such a toy really dates this book, and reinforces the difficulty I had in reading this book.

However, the turquoise mine was covered by a landslide and now the Yumatan do not know the location.  The Hollisters wonder whether the thefts are related to the turquoise mine.<br /><br />The Hollisters face many adventures as they discover the unique hiding place for the stolen goods.

At the time of my review, it was somewhat difficult to obtain to obtain books in this series.  Since then, Andrew E. Svenson III and other family members have been working to re-release the Happy Hollister series for new generations.  Andrew E. Svenson III is the grandson of the author.<br /><br />This particular book was the third in the series.  The reprint has the illustrations and text of the original hardback books.  Even better, the reprint is available as a Kindle book.<br /><br />The Happy Hollisters are somewhat of a relic of an era gone by.  The family consists of five children, Pete, Pam (Pamela), Ricky, Holly, and Sue, and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Hollister. The family pets include Zip, a collie, and White Nose, a cat, who has five kittens in this book.  Mr. Hollister purchases a store called The Trading Post, which sounds similar to general stores in days gone by.<br /><br />Throughout the series the children solve mysteries, usually as a family.  In this book the children receive a ceramic lighthouse from their Uncle Russ.  Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, their collie Zip accidentally knocks the lighthouse to the floor, breaking it.  When the children examine the broken lighthouse, they discover a genuine emerald.  Uncle Russ purchased the lighthouse at Sea Gull Beach and soon the Hollister family is off to visit Uncle Russ.<br /><br />When the children get to Sea Gull Beach they learn that a pirate ship called the Mystery disappeared during a storm somewhere near Sea Gull Beach, and treasure hunters had been searching for the ship ever since.  The children soon encounter Homer Ruffly and his father, who is mean and is leading a treasure hunting expedition for the Mystery.<br /><br />Though the children are not actually searching for the pirate ship, they seem to encounter items from the ship at every turn.  Homer Ruffly follows them around and does mean things to the children constantly, accusing them of stealing things that Homer claims rightfully belong to his father, when in fact the items belong to the Hollisters.<br /><br />The Hollister children do have a lot of fun on their trip.  They take boat rides on the ocean, enter a kite flying contest, and fly in a helicopter, along with hunting for the pirate ship Mystery.  The pirate theme of this Hollister book is all in good fun and younger children should be amused by the story.<br /><br />The Happy Hollisters series remains a reasonably good, if somewhat outdated, read for younger children, perhaps from ages 4 to 9. I suspect that by age 9 most children are entranced by more modern pursuits. Also, many children may consider families of five children to be somewhat unusual and that may take some explaining. These books may be an excellent way to introduce children to the changes that have taken place in our society over the past half century.<br /><br />While the original hardback books have become somewhat difficult to find, as I noted above, this edition is available once again as a paperback and a Kindle edition.

In this book, the children befriend a boy named Bobby.  Bobby is living with Farmer Gillis, as his mother went out west to earn money.  She had promised that as soon as she had earned some money she would return for Bobby.  Farmer Gillis was mean to Bobby, making him sell cookies and vegetables.  When Bobby wanted to have a little fun, Farmer Gillis yelled at Bobby.  Farmer Gillis told Bobby that he was ungrateful.<br /><br />The Hollister children learn that Bobby's grandfather, Moses Twigg, disappeared and that Bobby and his mother were unable to find him.  The children also learn from a local banker that Moses Twigg had money in the bank that had been there for 19 years.  If the money remained in the bank one more year, it would have to go to the state.<br /><br />It is not long before Bobby disappears, and everyone, the police and the Hollisters included, are out looking for Bobby.  The Hollisters travel in their Uncle Russ's new boat on the Muskong River (which seems to be an imaginary place) to see if they can locate Bobby.

It was somewhat difficult to obtain books in this series at that time.  Since then, Andrew E. Svenson III, grandson of the author, and other family members have been working to re-release the Happy Hollister series for new generations.<br /><br />Andrew E. Svenson wrote the 33 books in this series between approximately 1953 and 1970.  This particular book was the introduction to the series.

In this book we learn that Chet Morton, Frank and Joe Hardys' best friend, was the great-grandson of Ezekial Morton, who was honorary Chief Wallapatookunk of the Pashunk tribe.  We also meet the Ramapan tribe, which the author described as being 500 miles from Bayport.  However, in real life it appears that neither the Pashunk nor the Ramapan tribes actually exist.  The boys learn that someone is trying to take Ramapan land for a reason that they ultimately learn at the climax of the story.<br /><br />We also learn that Frank and Joe Hardy and their best friend Chet Morton play football for Bayport High.  Bayport High must also be a very small school, because Frank, Joe and Chet play on offense and defense.  There is a mistake in my revised edition of this book that caused me to re-read a couple of pages.  During the play against Hopkinsville, the text reads \\"Joe...a step ahead of the Bayport pass receiver.\\"  Joe is on Bayport High's team, and the team was playing against Hopkinsville, so he would have been trying to get the ball from the Hopkinsville receive.<br /><br />Anyway, the mystery kicks off with a suspicious man trying to sell Laura Hardy, the boys' mother, a leather key case with the letter \\"R\\" surrounded by a design.  The Frank and Joe Hardy observe the man through the window of their house trying to steal the key to their father's file cabinet.  Unfortunately, when the boys confront the man their mother explains that the man was transferring keys to the new case.  However, since this is a Hardy Boys mystery, we know this man is up to no good.  The boys soon learn that the man, Breck, may be a criminal.<br /><br />The boys learn that the symbol on the key case is that of the Ramapan tribe.  The Ramapans are located in the woods about 500 miles from Bayport.  It appears that they use suitcases hauled through the woods to deliver their hand-made crafts (seriously, that is what the books says - I had to laugh at this part).  The Ramapan chief asks Frank and Joe to solve the mystery of where the deed for their land was buried.  The previous chief buried the deed to protect it, and as the chief was dying he described the location of the deed to be where the crisscross shadow was located.<br /><br />Things heat up for the Hardys as they uncover clues one-by-one.  The boys and their best friend Chet discover that there is a gang out to find the deed.  The gang is very dangerous, and tries to kill Frank and Joe by pushing them in front of a train, and members of the gang attempt to push them off a cliff as well.  Why is the gang trying to hard to take the Ramapan's land?  That is the heart of this mystery!<br /><br />While the boys are trying to solve the Ramapan's mystery, the story also remotely follows the boys' father, Fenton Hardy, as he battles against saboteurs.  The entire family tries to keep their spirits up as there as Fenton appears to be in danger and then missing.  At one point the boys encounter someone who looks and sounds just like their father, but this man appears to be injured and defeated.  Things look grim for Fenton, Frank and Joe Hardy more than once in this book.<br /><br />The boys resolutely follow the trail of the criminals and the clues, and eventually find a crisscross shadow, but they still have a hard time finding the box containing the deed and a valuable dagger.  The criminals are right behind them and try to discover the location themselves.  The criminals finally force Frank and Joe to point out the location of the deed to the criminals.  The reader will have to discover what happens next.<br /><br />This book is quite bumpy in terms of readability.  Laura Hardy is quite annoying when she tells the boys that they are behaving badly, only to find out later that they are right.  Given that the boys have behaved very ethically for 31 previous books, her behavior appears unwarranted and should have been out of character.  While the description of the Native Americans was actually decent, the description should be updated.  It is unlikely that any Native American land is so remote that it can not be reached by road.  Lastly, the football descriptions should be updated as well.  Even small schools usually have a separate offense and defense, with very few players play both, especially in back-to-back plays.  These problems make this book slightly difficult to read and keep the rating in the 3 star range.<br /><br />The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14.  This particular book is a good fit for that age range.  Older readers may find it difficult to understand the social differences between this book and our current era, of which there are numerous examples throughout the book.

US	44759540	R1XKNTFU8FYB8Y	0448089319	820267631	The Secret of Wildcat Swamp (The Hardy Boys, No. 31)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Swamp in the West	I never realized there were swamps in the West.  I had assumed that swamps were generally located in the Southeast.  However, in this mystery Frank and Joe Hardy meet one wildcat near one swamp, so I guess there are both in this story.<br /><br />This book begins with Frank and Joe Hardy telling their best friend Chet Morton that their father, Fenton Hardy, has told his sons that they might be able to help him in a mystery involving train robbers.  Before the boys can get involved in their father's mystery, Thomas \\"Cap\\" Bailey, a track coach and science teacher at Bayport High, asks the boys to go out West with him to locate a source of valuable fossils near Wildcat Swamp.  He also asks the boys to help him solve the mystery of why he was robbed the first time he attempted to travel out West.<br /><br />When Frank and Joe ask their parents for permission to go out West, their father advises the boys that one of the train robbers said something like \\"twenty wildcat,\\" which Cap Bailey told the boys was on a sign at wildcat swamp.  Thus, the boys could also be in a position to help their father when they go west.<br /><br />The boys are prepared to journey west, but before they leave Cap Bailey is robbed and injured and a map of the area around Wildcat Swamp showing where the fossils are located.  As the boys try to take off with pilot Jack Wayne, their plane loses a wheel and the trio crash.  Uninjured, the three borrow another plane and head west.  They soon realize that someone is following them.<br /><br />Once the boys finally arrive out West, they head for Wildcat Swamp, where the one and only wildcat in this story leaps on Frank.  Fortunately, Joe killed the wildcat before it could do whatever it thought it was doing.  Incidentally, wildcats are not really a species as such.  In this case, the cat described sounds like a mountain lion, or a cougar.  It is unlikely that a mountain lion would attack three men on horseback, so the scenario in this book is moderately implausible.<br /><br />From this point forward the excitement builds rapidly.  The criminals the boys encounter kidnap lawmen and plan to ruthlessly execute them.  The criminals also capture the Hardy Boys more than once and plan to kill them as well.  The criminals also derail a train and plan on forcing a woman to sign her land over to them; the land that contains Wildcat Swamp!  These criminals are utterly ruthless.  The question the Hardys keep asking themselves is why the criminals want Wildcat Swamp and why they have been trying to prevent the Hardys from seeking out fossils.<br /><br />This story is yet another nicely paced and plotted Hardy Boys book.  There are parts of the mystery that the author reveals early in the story, and other parts that the author keeps hidden until a significant portion of the way into the story.  Thus a reader has things to learn about the mystery a good way into the story, maintaining reader interest throughout.  I was also pleased that the story was generally plausible, with only a few moments of weakness.  I would rate this story as one of the better books in the Hardy Boys series and I would recommend this book as an introduction into the series.oderately implausible. <br /> <br />From this point forward the excitement builds rapidly.

US	44759540	R1Z5PIW8ERS1DN	0743211383	241269653	Dreamcatcher	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Travel the Dreamcatcher	I keep thinking I should dislike this novel, but the problem is that I like it.  There are parts of the novel that I find annoying, but King writes so well that I found myself pulled along the dreamcatcher until I reached the end of the path.<br /><br />Four guys are out hunting in the wilderness of Maine.  One of the guys, Gary Jones, \\"Jonesy,\\" is up in a tree stand when a lost-looking guy appears out of nowhere.  Other than a propensity for extended flatulence, a strange-looking patch on his cheek, and a memory that seems vastly defective, the guy appears normal.  Being a nice guy, and given that Jonesy nearly shot the man, thinking he was a deer, Jonesy takes the man, Richard McCarthy, back to their cabin, which they call Hole in the Wall.  Unfortunately for Jonesy, Pete Moore, Henry Devlin, and Joe \\"Beaver\\" Clarendon, the man is sick in ways that no one could have guessed.<br /><br />We soon learn that an alien spaceship has crash landed, and the results are bizarre, sometimes nearly funny.  However, funny only goes so far, and it turns out that encounters with the aliens can have some seriously nasty side effects.<br /><br />Our story focuses on the four friends as they encounter animals quietly running away from something as well as people running to something, and the military men trying unsuccessfully in one place.  As often happens in Stephen King stories, not everyone survives to reach the end of the story, but whatever happens makes you want those friends remaining to triumph over that which has caused them pain and suffering.<br /><br />We also meet a military man, Kurtz, who is the stereotype of every sadistic, cunning and utterly ruthless military man ever depicted in a book or the movies.  While Kurtz was sent to decisively take care of the problem in Maine, Kurtz also appears to take some measure of enjoyment in what he does.  It also appears that Kurtz sometimes may deliberately place people in harm's way for purposes all his own.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this book was the depiction of the military.  Apparently Stephen King has taken a few things he has read about the military and expanded them into something unrealistic.  People like Kurtz would not be in the Army (which the book seems to imply he is, by equipment if not by style).  Kurtz would not be receiving orders from Cheyenne Mountain, which is an Air Force facility.  He most likely would be receiving orders from either the Pentagon (most likely), or Langley (less likely, but still plausible).<br /><br />The other, smaller problem with this book is that there is a lot of carry over from previous King books.  I kept wondering whether King was going to tie in \\"It\\" somehow because so many of the references in this book seemed similar to \\"It.\\"  King even mentions Pennywise the Clown.  However, other than a few references (like to Jerusalem's Lot), and some vague similarity in characters, this book is mostly unrelated to other King books.<br /><br />As long as you can get past King's portrayal of the military, if you are familiar with the military and the nearly familiar but not storylines from his previous books, you are left with a darn good story.  I was enthralled for the last couple of hundred pages and could barely wait to finish the book.  Though I was sad at the end, I have to say that this book has a good ending.<br /><br />King's quality has been bumpy, in my mind, in recent years.  However, this book is a good read.  This book makes effective use of things that go bump in the night.  I was also pleased that King did a coherent job of plotting his aliens' biology.  I think that King fans will find this book a good one, and even most casual fans of horror and aliens will find this book interesting.<br /><br />If you are wondering about the dreamcatcher, I must to tell you that you will have to read the book to learn about that.  It would take too long to explain the relevance of the dreamcatcher, which you will find out in the end when youread the book.  See the line, and enter the dreamcatcher.n the end when you read the book.  See the line, and enter the dreamcatcher. <br />	2005-07-20

But on dark and stormy afternoon Frank and Joe Hardy were caught outside Barmet Bay when the engine of the Sleuth died.  The violence of the ocean prevented making any attempt at repairs.  The boys spot a yacht, but are unable to make contact with it.  Soon the boys hear a helicopter, and then a siren.  The boys are able to glimpse the yacht and the helicopter for brief moments, but are unable to gain the attention of either.  As the helicopter passes overhead a wallet full of money drops into the water next to the Sleuth, and the boys are plunged into another mystery.<br /><br />Soon thereafter the Hardy boys' best friend Chet Morton has a truck with a shipment of high power rifles and camping equipment stolen while he is eating at a roadside restaurant; leaving the keys in the truck may have had something to do with the theft.  The trail leads to the North Woods, where wild dogs have been reported to roam.<br /><br />The mystery grows when Frank Hardy is kidnapped.  Frank and Joe have stumbled into some kind of mystery, but they are unable to understand the nature of the mystery.  Frank escapes by himself and halts payment of ransom just in time.<br /><br />Soon, Fenton Hardy reveals that he is involved in investigating the theft of United States currency in Central and South America.  Later, we learn that the money is being used to fund terrorists and to purchase arms for them.<br /><br />All trails seem to lead to the North Woods, where Frank and Joe Hardy and their friends encounter a man raising wolves, including Saber, a killer wolf.  The stakes are high as the brothers and their friends face death numerous times.<br /><br />There are a couple of problems with this story that I found distracting.  First, healthy wolves do not attack and kill people.  In spite of numerous studies that confirm this observation, people persist in portraying wolves as people killers.  Second, the criminals' preoccupation with $2,000 seems bizarre.  The criminals have a yacht, a helicopter, and numerous henchmen.  It seems strange that any criminal organization would be overly concerned with a mere $2,000.<br /><br />Other than these two annoyances, this adventure is exciting and interesting.  The teaser promised that this book would be one of the Hardy boys' most exciting adventures, and it appears that the book has fulfilled that promise.<br /><br />The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14.

Moments before General Smith arrives, a man identifying himself as Dr. Bush warns the boys to beware of General Smith.  Shortly thereafter a woman calls to warn the boys about Dr. Bush.  While the boys are discussing the phone calls a person calling himself General Smith shows up at the Hardy home.  The boys are concerned about General Smith's animated behavior and act strangely themselves.  The boys' behavior becomes more bizarre when Dr. Bush calls again and Joe Hardy and Chet Morton rush off to see if they can intercept Dr. Bush.  After Joe and Chet return, the tension between the boys and General Smith threatens to erupt when Fenton Hardy arrives and greets General Smith as an old friend.<br /><br />Frank and Joe Hardy and Chet Morton have become involved in a Smith family mystery that dates back to the Civil War.  Beauregard Smith, a cousin of General Smith's great-grandfather, promised to bury his gold and the local bank's gold if enemy troops got too close.

The most noticeable feature of the last couple of books is the simpler mystery as compared to the previous books where the mysteries were often very complicated.  The author (a fellow by the name of Andrew Svenson wrote the original, and Priscilla Baker-Carr wrote the revised version) also improved the pacing of the stories, with the action helping to move the book along reasonably briskly.<br /><br />This mystery begins with the boys investigating the mystery of a car that was left at Slo-Mo's garage in Pleasantville.  Slo-Mo has asked Fenton Hardy to find the owner of the car.  The car is missing its license plates and the engine serial number is gone.  The boys call in the local police, and then search the car, finding a portion of a watch band and a tie clasp with a crooked arrow design on it.  After the boys complete their search of the car they are about ready to leave when a man attempts to take the car from Slo-Mo.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter the boys witness two men in conversation.  Suddenly, one of the men slumps to the sidewalk, apparently passed out.  When the boys assist the man, they learn the other man robbed him.  Frank and Joe learn from their father that there is a gang robbing people along the East Coast by using a similar technique.  Before the investigation can proceed further Fenton Hardy is shot with an arrow!<br /><br />The trail leads the boys to a tobacco shop where they are able to buy \\"Arrow\\" cigarettes for $5 each.  The boys learn that a man by the name of Arrow Charlie brings the cigarettes around from time to time.  Before the boys can pursue the lead further, an urgent letter from their Cousin Ruth in New Mexico causes Fenton Hardy to send Frank, Joe and Chet Morton to investigate.  Cousin Ruth runs Crowhead Ranch, and her cowboys have been disappearing without a trace one at a time.<br /><br />Another airplane follows the boys as they travel to the ranch.  They also encounter engine trouble.  To their surprise, the boys also see the same crooked arrow symbol formed by trees as they fly toward the ranch.  It appears that Arrow Charlie and the robberies in Bayport may somehow be related to the mysteries on Cousin Ruth's ranch.<br /><br />As Frank, Joe and Chet continue their investigation, someone tries to shoot them with a poisoned arrow.  The boys also encounter a flash flood.  Someone sets fire to their Cousin Ruth's ranch.  The boys also learn where the missing cowboys went in an action packed ending for this book.<br /><br />The increasing pace of the action in this book, with the nicely focused mystery, make this book a good read and one of the better entries in this series.  I recommend this book for those looking for a sample of how interesting the Hardy Boys can be.<br /><br />The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14.

However, I was less than impressed with the previous book, \\"The Secret Panel.\\"  I thought this book was an improvement.  I will say that the mansion with no locks in the previous book was excellent, but the minimal action in the previous book made it a snoozer.  This book, on the other hand, has more action, but it has the most obnoxious central character of any Hardy Boys book yet, Thaddeus McClintock.<br /><br />Thaddeus McClintock is eccentric.  He has tantrums and is fussy.  He wants to take a long trip, but does not want to go by plane, train, or cruise ship.  The boys quickly hit on the idea of taking a trip by freighter.  However, Mr. Klack of Klack's Agency seems to be able to find passage for everyone except McClintock and the Hardys.<br /><br />Frank and Joe Hardy also become involved in a mystery involving their Aunt Gertrude.  She was expecting an important package, which the delivery company mixed up with someone else's package.  The mystery deepens when the boys try to retrieve the package.  The people at the house where the delivery company left the package had been gone for several days, and there is no clue as to what might have happened to the package except that the barn near the home is on fire when the Hardys arrive.<br /><br />The mystery deepens as the boys encounter a ship that seems to disappear.  I liked the plot device of a phantom ship.  However, the supposed disappearing act of the ship is glossed over in the explanation, and every time this series attempts any sort of scientific explanation the explanations are nearly always weak.  The explanation this time for how the phantom ship seems to disappear is even weaker than usual and I found the explanation a little insulting, which reduced my rating for this book.<br /><br />As Frank and Joe Hardy continue their investigation they learn that packages were delivered to houses where the occupants have been away.  What do the phantom freighter, the delivery of the packages, and Mr. Klack have in common?  These are the mysteries the Hardy boys need to solve.<br /><br />This mystery is more convoluted than some Hardy Boys mysteries, but it is also more interesting than some.  As the number of weak mysteries in the series increased, I worried that the series was going to deteriorate.  In some ways this book is weak, particularly with the character of McClintock and the explanations surrounding the ship.  However, I also found the mystery itself to be more challenging than others in the books just previous.  While the interesting mystery did not completely overcome the problems with the story, it did make the story more interesting to read.  However, as with the previous story, this book may be passed over unless you want to read the entire series.<br /><br />The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14.

The review for this book required a title that meant something similar.  The teaser for this book promises thrills and suspense, but it does not deliver.<br /><br />Frank and Joe Hardy meet John Mead when his car has an accident.  Soon the Hardys learn that John Mead was killed five years earlier.  The boys also discover that the late Mr. Mead had no will and no heirs.  The boys take a key, which they found after the man calling himself John Mead left the accident scene, and visit the Mead mansion.  The mansion has four doors and no keyholes.<br /><br />The theme of this book is locks.  The late John Mead was a locksmith, and he built a house apparently devoid of locks because he no longer wanted to see locks after he retired.  The boys also encounter a group of burglars and learn that a boy named Lenny Stryker may have inadvertently become involved with the burglars.  Frank and Joe also learn that Lenny may have been shot.  Lenny was able to call his mother, but the only words she could make out were \\"secret panel.\\"<br /><br />Eventually Frank and Joe find the secret panel.  They also find Lenny and capture the crooks, learning the relationship between the man calling himself John Mead with the late John Mead.<br /><br />The mansion without locks is one of the most interesting plot devices devised for the Hardy Boys series.  Unfortunately, the plot drags and the level of excitement stays low.  I was more interested in the story ending than I was in the mystery, which is never a good sign.  The only thing I found fascinating was the house with no apparent locks, including the locks inside the house.  This story is definitely one that can be left as a later read for collectors or can be left altogether for those interested in only the best of the Hardy Boys.  However, consider the uniqueness of the Mead mansion before dismissing this book completely.<br /><br />The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14.

The author paced the action better and formulated the mystery better than in the books just prior to this book.  While I rated this book at four stars, when I compare this book with other books in the series I think it is one of the better books in this series.<br /><br />Frank and Joe Hardy become involved in a mystery surrounding a new reservoir for Bayport.  The reservoir is complete, but the water level is not rising.  To be more specific, the water level rises during the daytime, but then drops during the night.  If authorities are unable to solve the mystery, Bayport may soon be out of water.<br /><br />Some of the Hardy Boys mysteries are very convoluted and complicated.  This story has a much simpler, focused story.  The story still has multiple facets, but everything revolves around why the reservoir will not fill.  Because the story has focus, it is easier to follow, and I think it is also more interesting.  I also think that because of the focus, the main story line has more detail than many of the previous books in this series, particularly those with multiple overlapping mysteries that the author often explains minimally.<br /><br />This story also has fewer science elements, which many of the previous books handle poorly.  This story focuses on the mystery and uses as little science as possible to establish the story and the mystery.  Because of the focus and the minimal reliance on science, this story is easier to read and easier to believe.  Because the author focused this story more tightly focused than previous stories, it is also more enjoyable.  I look forward to the next mysteries in this series to see if the author maintained the quality of the story line exhibited by this book.<br /><br />The Hardy Boys series is recommended for ages 8 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14.

Even when the stories were weak, they still had a measure of interest.  However, this story is the weakest yet in the series.  There are some problems with the way the story was written, and the entire premise is not fully exploited.<br /><br />Chet Morton, the Frank and Joe Hardy's best friend, has started yet another hobby.  This time he is into taxidermy.  Chet convinces the brothers to attend an auction at the Elias Batter Estate.  Elias was well-known for his abilities as a taxidermist, and Chet is hoping to purchase samples of his work.<br /><br />No sooner does the trio arrive at the auction when they encounter a station wagon roaring away from the auction and someone yelling \\"Stop, thief.\\"  The two Hardys jump into their car to give pursuit, leaving Chet with his auction purchases.  The boys finally lose the car after encountering a deer that was hit by the escaping car.  The Hardy Boys have encountered another mystery!<br /><br />We soon discover that someone is stealing animals stuffed by Elias Batter from all over the place.  We also encounter Elias Batter's nephew, and his greedy wife is hovering in the background.  We are given a tantalizing tidbit that there may be something hidden in one of the animals, and that something may have been the result of a crime committed by Elias Batter.  We also learn that there may be some sort of spies involved in stealing secrets from a number of industrial plants.  The question is: what does that have to do with the stuffed animals?<br /><br />The problem with this mystery is that it never really takes off.  The pace of the story just seems to plod along.  Even near the end, from the time the boys learn who the criminals likely are to the time the boys encounter the criminals and the criminals are captured only requires five pages of description.  There is no time to build any suspense or to place the boys in any danger.  Even at the end of the story Mrs. Batter gets one line, and then the author ignores her completely.  I get the feeling from the writing that the author was just trying to wring a story from a concept, and did not want to put any effort into really developing the plot.<br /><br />This story is nearly so weak to deserve two stars, but I only give two stars to things that I could not recommend to anyone.  I will say that this book is worth having for a fan of the Hardys, especially those collecting the series.  However, this story is not the place to begin reading the series, and if you are seeking the better books in the series, you can definitely pass this one by.<br /><br />Though the Hardy Boys series was written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent.  The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14.  As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12.  I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be.  Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading.he end of the story Mrs. Batter gets one line, and then the author ignores her completely.

The mystery also involves a radioactive substance, which foreshadows some of the concerns we have several decades later.<br /><br />Fenton Hardy, the boys' father, has run into difficulties in trying to solve the crashes of two light planes into the cliffs adjacent to Marlin Crag Airport near Beemerville.  Both pilots were landing from the sea in bad weather using instruments.  However, both pilots were experienced.  Fenton asks the boys to look around Marlin Crag airport to see if they can learn anything.  In the meantime, Fenton will be investigating a ring of freight thieves who have been stealing from airports.  As you might guess, there is a connection between the cases.<br /><br />Frank, Joe and their friend Chet Morton soon find their lives in danger when they ask questions that concern certain individuals they encounter.  Things become more interesting when the boys get jobs playing in the band at a local night spot.  It quickly becomes evident that someone wants the Hardys and Chet out of the way, permanently!<br /><br />During the investigation the boys discover a radioactive plane engine.  Chet Morton purchases a plane fuselage, only to have it stolen.  Why does the night club use only its own amplifiers, and what is the interest certain individuals have in the amplifiers?  What is the relationship between smuggled diamonds and the radioactive isotopes?  The most quickly solved mystery is what the \\"flickering torch\\" is.<br /><br />I enjoyed this mystery.  While I am unsure of some of the science, it was sufficiently plausible that I was able to overlook any weakness in the science to focus on the mystery.  I was also sufficiently puzzled by the purposes of the criminals that I found myself reading this book from cover to cover quickly.

Apparently the Seneca believe that Dr. Rideau has the artifact, and is deliberately keeping if from them.  On the other hand, Dr. Rideau seems to be having a good deal of problems with intruders and small acts of vandalism that his renters, a couple of professors from Zoar College, continually attribute to the Seneca.<br /><br />The story begins when Frank and Joe Hardy convince their best friend, Chet Morton, to investigate Zoar College.  Fenton Hardy, the boys' father, ask the boys to talk with Rod Jimerson, a Seneca who lives in Cleveland.  The story begins to get complicated when the boys travel to Zoar Valley.<br /><br />It turns out that Zoar College is an abandoned shack in the middle of nowhere.  Soon Chet's application fee is returned, evidence that the questions the boys asked about the college are troubling someone.  The boys also have their doubts about the ethics and credentials of the professors boarding with the Rideaus.  The boys also noticed the Rideaus have a substantial coin college in a vault in their house.<br /><br />The Hardys and Chet soon receive warnings to leave Zoar Valley.  Seneca masks are stolen, and before you can guess who the criminals are, the Rideaus' coin collection is stolen.  Actually, by the time the coins are stolen you pretty much know who the criminals are.<br /><br />In terms of a mystery, this story is one of the lesser books in the series.  There is actually very little mystery, except for the location of the melted coins, and once you learn where they are there is little surprise.

Since a good portion of this book takes place in California's grape growing regions, I was able to imagine many of the scenes in this book quite well.  Because of this coincidence, I found this book to be very enjoyable.<br /><br />The Hardy boys have taken up fencing.  One day their fencing master, Ettore Russo, tells the boys that he must close the fencing school because he needs to find a piece of a sword that may hold the key to his inheritance.  Intrigued, the boys follow clues that lead to California, where they believe the broken piece to be.  Of course, at least one other person is also looking for the sword, and that person is stopping at nothing to be sure that person locates the sword first, even if it means someone else gets hurt.<br /><br />This story is relatively less complicated than many other Hardy Boys stories.  To spice the story up a little the author added a subplot about a voice identification system.  These systems are quite sophisticated today, but at the time this story was written the systems must have been very new.<br /><br />While several other reviewers have indicated that this story is mediocre, the author paced it nicely and the story is plotted well.  I found myself intrigued by the mystery of the sword, which makes this story more of a true mystery with less of a criminal subplot.  Further, other than a few incidents, there is relatively less violence in this book than in many other Hardy Boys books.  While the story has less action, the quality of the mystery and the accurate setting in California keep this mystery in the four star range.<br /><br />Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent.  The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14.  As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12.

US	44759540	R2I40U0QPXKQ7	044808919X	388631691	The Disappearing Floor (Hardy Boys)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Science Fiction Hardys	There was a fascination in the 30s with science fiction.  The original Hardy Boys book which was revised into this book was originally written in the early half of the last century, as you can tell by the improbably gadgets described in this story.<br /><br />This mystery is one of the most bizarre of the early Hardy Boys' books.  There are supposed ghosts, a mysterious death, secret passages, missing documents, and a host of other unusual circumstances, including an eccentric scientist, missing diamonds, and a possible source of amethysts.<br /><br />One of the most difficult aspects of this book is its complexity.  Numerous elements are woven together from the very beginning of the book that leaves you hanging until near the end.  As one example, there is a floor that seems to come and go and for a good portion of the book the Hardy boys have a difficult time knowing whether the disappearing floor actually exists.<br /><br />I found the eccentric scientist and his gadgets humorous.  While his devices might have seemed possible when this book was written in 1940, we are reasonably certain today that some of the devices described are unlikely to exist.  However, I found it enjoyable to think back to an era when anything seemed possible.<br /><br />The complexity of the story does make it a bit difficult to follow.  This Hardy Boys' book would benefit from an expansion of the story, or a revision to eliminate some of the elements.  I found myself re-reading portions of the book because I missed a detail.  However, at the end the author does explain all the details to clarify what happened.<br /><br />As complex as this story is, I enjoyed it.  Much of the story is so incredible that it throws the story into another reality that allows you to ignore the dire danger that the Hardys find themselves in.  This other reality also allows you to overlook the coincidences and the complexity of the story.  This book is one of my favorites in this series.<br /><br />Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent.  The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14.

Just like the last Hardy Boys book, \\"A Figure in Hiding,\\" this book is somewhat less thrilling than the others.  This time the Hardys are seeking the golden head of Pharaoh Rhamaton IV, which was supposedly on board a sunken freighter, the Katawa.  The Hardy Boys journey to nearby Whalebone Island where they receive the \\"secret warning.\\"  However, secret warning seems to be an oxymoron as the warning is received from a lighthouse.  The sender of the warning did not want to be known at that time, but he wanted the Hardys to see the warning.<br /><br />As the story proceeds the boys encounter a rather suspicious group of sailors on a salvage ship operating near where the Katawa sank.  The Hardys believe the salvage ship might be attempting to recover the head from the Katawa.  Later the Hardy boys discover even more suspicious evidence on the Katawa itself.<br /><br />Later the boys discover that there is a sunken U-boat (a World War II German submarine) near where the Katawa sank.  The boys also discover they have allies from an unexpected place.<br /><br />As with most Hardy Boys books, there are questions galore.  Who is the ghost of the pirate on Whalebone Island?  What is the significance of the U-boat?  Where is the golden pharaoh's head?  Who is trying to warn the Hardys to stay away from Whalebone Island?  The answer to these and many other questions are revealed as the pages of this mystery unfold.<br /><br />This story is another story that has less excitement than many of the other early books in this series.  I was somewhat jaded by this point and knew immediately that the ghost was a man, and was just a little bored with the author's shallow deceptions in this book.  I am still happy that I read the book, but it is one of the weaker entries in this series.<br /><br />Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent.

The mystery revolves around eye symbols, and a gang called the Goggler Gang, also known as the Evil Eyes.  The gang used simple hand symbols to alert fellow gang members when to stay away or when everything was okay.  Then there was the mysterious eye the Hardy boys found on a hydrofoil, the Sea Spook.<br /><br />This mystery begins with a blind peddler passing a mysterious note to the boys after a baseball game.  The cryptic note read, \\"WATCH OUT FOR THE FIRST SIGNS OF BAD EYESIGHT!\\"  Scribbled in pencil on the opposite side of the card was \\"Tell FH!\\"  The boys rightly assume that they should tell their father, Fenton Hardy.<br /><br />Soon the boys are encountering eye signs everywhere.  Since the boys persist in investigating a group that they learn is called the Goggler Gang, someone arranges for an accident that was to murder the boys and the blind peddler.  The gang tries several times to warn the boys, without (of course) success.  As the boys persist in their investigations they encounter a gang of suspicious characters, and Malcolm Izmir, who is apparently an ordinary businessman.  Yet, Izmir seems to turn up far too often during the boys' investigation.  The boys also find a mysterious fake eye while on the hydrofoil Sea Spook.  The boys realize that the eye is probably part of their mystery, but they do not understand how it is related.<br /><br />As with most Hardy boys' mysteries, the excitement builds to the end.  Even Fenton Hardy is in danger when the Goggler Gang discovers that he has been spying on them.  Fortunately ever-faithful friend Chet Morton helps save the day, along with the always timely Chief Collig.<br /><br />The level of excitement in Hardy Boys books varies a lot.  There have been several of the first sixteen books where the pacing was quick, and I was anxious to get to the end.  However, this book moved along too slowly, and the action portions seemed to either develop too slowly, or so quickly that they were over before I had a time to register that action was upon me.  While a person interested in the Hardy boys will likely want to read all the books, a casual reader may want to pass this one as this story is the weakest of the first sixteen books in the series.<br /><br />Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent.

Wells meets Edgar Rice Burroughs	I was quite fascinated with the first volume of \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\\"  I expected the second volume to be just as fascinating as the first.  This time out Alan Moore begins the story on Mars with characters from Edgar Rice Burroughs' series of Mars books starring John Carter.  The creatures leaving Mars are doing so because John Carter and the Martians of Edgar Rice Burroughs' stories were preparing to deal with them permanently.<br /><br />On Earth we meet with the beloved, though somewhat psychopathic, characters of the first book once again.  Similar to Robert Heinlein's novel \\"The Puppet Masters,\\" we see mysterious cylinders land and watch the reaction of the locals.  Of course the initial reaction is one of curiosity, as no one suspects the danger presented by those within the cylinder.  When the first people die we realize that, just as in the original H.G. Wells novel and in \\"The Puppet Masters,\\" that these creatures are will not negotiate, preferring to extinguish us instead.<br /><br />The five central characters, Allan Quartermain, Captain Nemo, Mina Murray, Hawley Griffin, and Edward Hyde, set out to examine the cylinders.  After realizing the danger the cylinders impose, M plots a course carefully, eventually leading to the addition of a new character, Dr. Moreau, and a group of creatures endowed by Dr. Moreau with unique attributes.  Eventually Dr. Moreau proves critical to the defense of London from the Martians.<br /><br />During the quest for solutions to the Martian menace we discover that one of the five members of the League has betrayed them.  This same person attacks Mina, leaving her injured.  We also watch as romance develops between Allan Quartermain and Mina Murray, the heroine of \\"Dracula.\\"  This particular volume features rather risqu&eacute; images of the lustful couple.  Later in the novel, another member of the League will revenge Mina in a most disturbing and brutal way, which may eventually hail the end of the league as we know it.<br /><br />I think this second volume is better than the first volume.  Alan Moore was able to capitalize on the character development of the first volume, and thus was able to spend more time on developing the story.  Moore also focuses more deeply on the mental problems that each of the characters has, providing the book with two levels of story.<br /><br />The artwork is also better than in the first book.  The imagery is detailed and well matches my mental image of Victorian England.  Those details relating to the Martians match my recollection of the original H.G. Wells story.  The colors used are vibrant and enhance the story, much like lighting is critical in film.<br /><br />I have one minor complaint about the novel.  I thought the ending was just a little too quick.  Perhaps it was appropriate and it was in keeping with the original story.  Certainly Moore was attempting to create some surprise in an ending that most of us already know, and perhaps the speedy ending was necessary to prevent people from guessing the ending.  Regardless of the motivation, the transition from the story to the ending seemed a bit abrupt.  However, this complaint is minor, and the superb quality of the story outweighs such minor issues.<br /><br />In addition to the principle story, there is a 46 page story about various sights to be seen around the world.  Included are various castles, palaces and other interesting locales.  For example, there is a detailed discussion of a certain young lady by the name of Alice, who apparently found a portal into another world.  There are other descriptions of giants and leprechauns, and where these creatures might be found, and numerous others.  The 46 pages are a tour of the world as the \\"Twilight Zone\\" might have done it.<br /><br />The second volume of \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" exceeds the first volume in the story and in the artwork.  This book is a worthwhile permanent addition to my library, and fans of graphic novels are sure to agree.fans of graphic novels are sure to agree. <br />	2005-05-07

I was quite pleased that Max Allan Collins was able to write an intriguing story to the art of Gabriel Rodriguez and Ashley Wood.<br /><br />We have seen variations on this story before.  A serial killer is on the loose who is killing women in the style of Jack the Ripper.  There is a Rippermania convention in Las Vegas with too many people who know too much about Jack the Ripper, and it appears that the killer is trying to duplicate Jack's crimes precisely.  This story goes into extensive detail regarding the original crimes of Jack the Ripper.  I am unfamiliar with the details of Jack's legacy, so I must accept that the facts as stated by the CSI team must have some historical accuracy.  If so, it appears that Max Collins must have done a lot of research.<br /><br />The story follows not only the mystery of the serial killer, but there is a second murder to intrigue the reader, similar to the style of the television series.  There is some evidence that the second murder has some relationship to the serial killings.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed the story.  While another reviewer stated they knew who the killer was immediately, I only had an idea who the killer might be until the team had eliminated the suspects sufficiently to allow me to guess more accurately.  When it comes to mysteries such as this, you may guess correctly, but someone else, like me, may not.  If you do guess the killers correctly, congratulations!  However, I would rather follow the team and see how they scientifically find the killer rather than guessing, which leads to mistrials and dismissals.<br /><br />I was somewhat disappointed with the artwork.  Some of the art was good.  In other places the artwork was poor, with the faces of the CSI team out of proportion.  When the artists changed to a more highly conceptual form to illustrate in a more artistic style the results were often interesting.  However, on average the artwork was mediocre.  Of course, I read the story for the story and not for the artwork, though better artwork would have enhanced the story.<br /><br />If you need more of a CSI fix than three television shows and their numerous syndicated reruns can give you, then give this book a chance.  I thought the story was intriguing.  The artwork is only fair, so ignore the artwork for the story.  If you tend to guess the solutions to mysteries accurately, you may also want to pass this book by.  I will probably re-read the story because I liked it, but I will also be watching for clues to the killer, now that I know who he or she is.lustrate in a more artistic style the results were often interesting.

This mystery is set in and around the coastal town of Larchmont, Georgia.  The boys start out trying to help a man accused of libel, and end up getting involved in a hidden treasure, secret passages, mysterious characters, and a monster.  Of course, there is also the central mystery of the hidden harbor.<br /><br />Bart Worth is the publisher of the Larchmont Record, a newspaper.  Bart wrote a story about Samuel Blackstone.  The story was carefully written and completely factual.  However, after the story was set in type, remembering that this story was updated in 1961 and computer publishing was many years in future, someone added a rumor that the Blackstone fortune was obtained from smuggling.  Samuel Blackstone was in the process of suing Bart for libel, and Bart was requesting help from the Hardys to either find the person responsible for changing the article, or find information about the Blackstone family to prove that they had started their fortune based on smuggling.<br /><br />The boys once again have jumped into the thick of a complicated mystery.  Samuel Blackstone's brother, Ruel Rand, lives on property adjacent to Samuel's.  It appears to the boys that either Samuel or Ruel is out to hurt the other brother as each is attacked.  Added to the mystery is the disappearance of a seamstress and a butler.  The boys also learn that the pond between the Blackstone and the Rand estates is rumored to have a treasure associated with it, a treasure that can be found at the hidden harbor.<br /><br />As the boys continue their investigation, they learn that others are involved in the apparent plot between Blackstone and Rand.  It seems these other characters may be working for Blackstone, trying to keep the boys away from any information related to the impending lawsuit, the disappearing people, the pond, the treasure, and the brother's estates.  However, these other characters are vicious, attempting to harm the boys more than once, including leaving them stranded on a deserted island, and knocking them out.<br /><br />As the boys unravel the clues to the various mysteries, they encounter a long-unused secret entrance and rooms related to the entrance.  The entrance and the secret rooms may be related to at least some parts of the mysteries.  Most unusual of all, the boys encounter a monster in the pond.<br /><br />Join the boys in a classically styled mystery that reminded me of 30s-styled mysteries.  Spooky mansions, secret passages and rooms, mysterious characters and a monster provide an enjoyable atmosphere to this Hardy Boys mystery.<br /><br />I have one minor complaint about this book.  The cover of the book features a reptile.  The reptile should be an alligator to match the novel.  However, the reptile on the cover appears to be a crocodile, not an alligator.  Also, the boys refer to the cold water, and alligators and crocodiles are very sluggish in cold water.  Minor complaints about an otherwise enjoyable mystery.<br /><br />Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent.  The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14.  As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12.  I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be.

The boys have been involved in secret weapons before, but this is the first time that a Hardy Boys book has acquired a slight science fiction flavor.<br /><br />Fenton Hardy asks Frank and Joe Hardy to assist him in a case.  Someone is stealing information about a high speed turbine motor developed by the Alden Automotive and Research Company.  Keith Alden, a former race car driver, started this company.  In addition to the thefts, several of his race cars have met with unusual accidents.  The windows of the cars suddenly crazed and became milky, making it impossible for the cars' drivers to see where they were steering, and they crashed.<br /><br />As the boys investigate, they learn there are a number of characters that may be involved in the mystery.  One person that appears too often is Keith Alden's son Roger.  Roger is arrogant and keeps doing things he should not, such as driving the experimental race cars when his father told him not to.  Roger also treats Frank and Joe poorly, accusing them of bothering him and harassing him.  The boys also learn of twin brothers, Vilno Sigor and Barto Sigor, the former an engineer and designer and the latter a sheet metal worker.  According to Mr. Alden, the two brothers are opposites, with Vilno being a troublemaker and Barto being stable.  Lastly, the brothers meet several other unsavory characters as the story evolves, including a manager of a horse farm that their Aunt Gertrude inherits.<br /><br />The boys must learn who is stealing Mr. Alden's secrets.  They must also learn how the criminals cause the crazing of windshields.  As the boys investigate the mystery events become even more mysterious with the theft of a valuable race horse, also owned by Mr. Alden.<br /><br />The boys suspicion that Roger Alden may somehow be involved in the various mysteries.  His actions are strange, often appearing devious.  More than once he seems to be where crimes take place.  Of course, there are the times when he is caught taking race cars for joys rides, and crashing them as well.<br /><br />As the book concludes, the boys learn of scientific masterminds who have developed a unique weapon that causes car windows to craze.  That weapon is but one in their arsenal.  The boys realize that the criminals involved in the schemes they are investigating have lethal weapons, and they are ready to use them!<br /><br />Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent.

The boys see a periscope in Barmet Bay as they are cruising in their boat, the Sleuth.  Shortly thereafter another boat comes dangerously close to the Sleuth, leaving a dent in the boat.  The boys soon discover that they have inadvertently become involved in a very complex scheme that spans two countries and two oceans.<br /><br />The boys learn that their mystery overlaps their father's, and involves a scam artist and a missing bookkeeper.  The boys travel with their father to Mazatlan, Mexico, where the mysteries deepen.  It appears that in the remote village of Montaraz that people have been disappearing.  The disappearances appear to be associated with Pavura.  Just who, or what, Pavura might be is a mystery.  All the boys learn is that Pavura has a mark that instills terror in those who see it.<br /><br />As the boys, along with Chet Morton and Tico, a Mexican boy, search for clues in the desert surrounding Montaraz, the boys learn that villagers have seen a submarine in the ocean waters near Montaraz.  The mystery deepens further yet when the boys discover a railroad being built from the desert to the Pacific Ocean shore.<br /><br />As the boys wander the desert attempting to explain these mysteries, they encounter caves, armed and dangerous men, a river that threatens to plunge them into a crevasse, and they actually board and escape from the submarine.  In a final showdown the boys join with the Mexican army and helicopters to resolve the many mysteries.<br /><br />This Hardy Boys mystery is the first to involve submarines.  The mystery also involves a product of Mexico that is even more important today than it was when this story was revised in 1967.

The Hardy Boys become involved in a series of mysteries that involve a foreign dictator, missing people, stolen luggage, and secret work at Micro-Eye, a plant doing some kind of top secret work for the government.  Mixed into all this action are mysterious people who run from the Hardys, but also run from those the Hardys believe to be criminals.  Furthermore, what does Orrin North, the shipping magnate, have to do with all these mysteries?<br /><br />As the mysteries unfold, the Hardys learn that people who have been smuggled from a Caribbean dictatorship have been disappearing.  An investigator sent to learn more has disappeared.  It also appears that someone is after the top secret project at Micro-Eye.  Perhaps it is not a coincidence that Orrin North's ships are no longer accepting passengers.<br /><br />While this book contains some interesting mysteries, I was less impressed with the action and the story than some of the previous stories.  The story is interesting, and you want to get to the end, but the mystery is less well developed than in other books up to this point.  While giving four stars is probably being generous, the story seemed worth more than just three stars.  However, this book is not the one which I would use as a starting point for the series.<br /><br />Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent.  The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14.

In the third boxed set there are twists and mysteries and ever more scary moments as the children try to make their way in the world.  V.F.D. seems to crop up in ever more places without a resolution as to the meaning of V.F.D.<br /><br />As a fan of this series is aware, in the last story, \\"The Ersatz Elevator\\", the Baudelaire orphans, Violet, Klaus, and baby Sunny, had just lost their last home as one of their guardians was in league with the awful Count Olaf.  On the theory that it takes a village to raise a child, Mr. Poe, the children's supposed guardian, takes the children to V.F.D., a village populated by crows and weird people in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />The children's fortunes do not improve.  The townspeople force the children to do chores all day long.  Many of the people for whom they do chores little appreciate what the children do.  Lastly, the children and everyone in town must follow an extensive list of incredibly ridiculous rules.<br /><br />Soon after the children arrive in town they find a note (a rhyming couplet) from their previously kidnapped friends, Duncan and Isadora Quagmire, kidnapped two books ago by Count Olaf.  As time proceeds, the children find more couplets written by Isadora Quagmire.  The children hope and believe the couplets will lead them to the Quagmires.<br /><br />As always happens, Count Olaf shows up again.  As usual, he has assorted followers with him, including one surprise returning character (I'm not telling!).  This time Count Olaf shows up as a detective to solve a murder in the village.  The victim will be an amazing surprise to every reader (and I'm not telling you that one either!).<br /><br />Of course the story climaxes in a way that might lead the reader to believe that the Baudelaire's will escape.  Well, the children do get away from town, but they are on the run for a crime they didn't commit.  The ending of this story neatly fits into the beginning of the next book, \\"The Hostile Hospital.\\"<br /><br />In the eighth book in the series, we not only get to be miserable with the Baudelaire orphans, we also get to be afraid.  \\"The Hostile Hospital\\" picks up where \\"The Vile Village\\" left off.  The children are walking away from the village of V.F.D., trying to figure out what to do now that they are on the run from the law.<br /><br />The children come to a general store in the middle of nowhere, which fortunately contains a telegraph.  They try to contact Mr. Poe to tell him they did not commit the crime of which they are accused.  Unfortunately, the children do not hear back from Mr. Poe before the person that delivers the newspaper arrives and shows the store owner a picture of the children in the newspaper.  After a chase through the store the children escape into a van containing the most bizarre collection of hospital volunteers that you have ever seen.<br /><br />The children realize they need to do some research to see if they can find more information about their family, and the murdered person in the village of V.F.D.  By a strange coincidence, the hospital has a huge records department in the basement containing hundreds of file cabinets of information from all over the county.  By another strange coincidence the children are able to volunteer to work in this facility.<br /><br />As you can imagine, the children have to live somewhere, and they would rather not have to drive back and forth in the van lest someone recognize them.  Further, where would they go anyway?  So the children live in the unfinished half of Heimlich Hospital, using a canvas cover for a blanket and to keep warm.<br /><br />The children's search through the records is disturbed by the arrival of, you guessed it, Count Olaf.  This time we see very little of Count Olaf, and instead see another character the reader will know from a previous story (I'm not telling!).  During a chase through the records room one of the Baudelaire orphans is captured, and Count Olaf and his gang of criminals plan to do an operation on the captured orphan that is planned to turn fatal.<br /><br />The Baudelaire orphans left \\"The Hostile Hospital\\" in a very dangerous way.  However, once again the children use their wits to figure out how to escape their predicament.<br /><br />The children find themselves in a rundown carnival with another bizarre cast of characters, including several supposed \\"freaks.\\"  However, the freaks are not really all that freakish, one being a contortionist and one being ambidextrous.  The children disguise themselves as freaks and manage to fool Count Olaf and his gang for most of the book.  However, as we all know, eventually Count Olaf finds the children and another harrowing ending ensues.<br /><br />Over the last two or three books we've been given tidbits about bigger mysteries surrounding the children and their parents.  In this book the tidbits become much more substantial, and give us a clue as to the direction the series might take.  While it may seem that my description is a bit vague, that is because I do not wish to give away any of the surprises in this book, and there is at least one very big surprise for the children and the reader, as well as a number of smaller surprises.<br /><br />As I noted earlier, there are a lot of surprises in this book.  Those surprises make for one of the most intriguing books in this series.  I am anxiously anticipating the next volume, and even more, the end of the series, when I am hoping all the mysteries are solved.<br /><br />These three books will provide readers with hours of enjoyment.  The mysteries deepen with each, and all I can say at this point is, when will we see the final book in the series?!?!f the Baudelaire orphans is captured, and Count Olaf and his gang of criminals plan to do an operation on the captured orphan that is planned to turn fatal. <br /> <br />The Baudelaire orphans left \\"The Hostile Hospital\\" in a very dangerous way.

The mystery begins a visitor looking for Fenton Hardy, the famous detective.  Mr. and Mrs. Hardy are on vacation, to the distress of Mr. Dalrymple.  The boys explain factually to Mr. Dalrymple that they also solve crimes, but they do so without bragging and without trying to convince him.  Mr. Dalrymple suggests the boys take a hike to the Jason Purdy house and look around.<br /><br />While hiking, a big black car nearly hits the Hardy boys and their friends Chet Morton and Biff Hooper.  Once the group reaches the Purdy house they look around without seeing anything too suspicious, but when they report later to Mr. Dalrymple the boys learn that Mr. Dalrymple locked the gate, which they found open, the night before.<br /><br />The boys also learn that the Purdy house has a secret room in it which Mr. Dalrymple has been using when working on especially difficult contracts.  In the room, with its one entrance that has a time lock, Mr. Dalrymple has found threatening notes.  One such note read, \\"Death while the clock ticks!\\"  Mr. Dalrymple has searched the room carefully and determined there is not other entrance.  The boys agree to investigate the mystery.<br /><br />The boys also become involved in a mystery involving harbor thieves, who have been robbing ships and boats in Bayport.  The boys also discover that someone has used their boat, the Sleuth, and Tony Prito's boat, the Napoli, to commit some of the robberies.  In one chase between the boys and the crooks, one of the boats sinks!<br /><br />To further complicate this story, we learn that Hurd Applegate, who we met in the very first Hardy boy's mystery, \\"The Tower Treasure,\\" has had valuable jade jewelry and a chess set stolen from him.  Mr. Applegate is upset over how brazen the thieves were.  Even more interesting, Mr. Applegate believes that Mr. Dalrymple is one of the thieves.<br /><br />This already complicated story gets even more complicated when a mysterious man named \\"Mr. Smith\\" asks the boys' Aunt Gertrude questions about the boys.  Who is the mysterious stranger?  Is he a criminal involved in one of the mysteries the boys are investigating?  Is it possible he intends the boys harm?<br /><br />This story gets quite involved, involving hidden places and characters the boys do not meet until late in the story.  Some of those characters will turn out to be crooks, and others may not be.  The boys will have to sort it all out in an ending that involves the boys being captured by a criminal mastermind and being threatened with a bomb!<br /><br />This story has as much action or perhaps more than any Hardy Boys book that I have yet read.  The action was reasonably easy to follow, though a couple of times I had to go back and re-read short sections.  There is a lot of information crammed into few pages.  My edition in the 1962 revision, which attempted to update the series and while the update succeeded, there are a few places where the author could have provided additional details.  Even so, this book is one of my favorites in this series.<br /><br />Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent.  The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14.  As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12.

Their father asked them to break into someone's home to retrieve a mysterious package.  The boys find a way into the house, but almost as quickly as they have entered the house they see car headlights.  Soon another set of thieves enter the house.  After a tussle with the thieves the Hardy Boys are able to locate the mysterious package in a secret hiding place.<br /><br />Soon the Hardy Boys are in the midst of one of their most dangerous cases.  One of the boys is kidnapped.  The boys tail a criminal to New York City and are nearly run down in a subway.  Later the boys are in a plane that develops serious engine trouble, threatening the boys with death!  Even with all the danger the boys face, there is yet more to come when the boys learn what is in the mysterious package and why the crooks want the package.<br /><br />The author seems to be hooked on caves.  The caves that appeared in \\"The Shore Road Mystery\\" appear prominently in this book.  I think that once crooks find a good set of caves they must pass the location on to their friends.<br /><br />I noticed a couple of rough spots where it appeared the more recent authors who revised the story may have eliminated some prose and struggled to smooth out transitions.  I also thought the description of the electronics was a bit weak.  Why were the electronics so valuable?  Of course, today we expect electronics to be inexpensive.  In another update perhaps the author will describe the electronics as the only prototype of a new video game in existence, or something similar.<br /><br />This story moved along briskly, with a lot of action.  This story is reasonably well written and held my attention from beginning to end.  I think this story is one of the better stories in the series.<br /><br />Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent.

The Hardy Boys have an adventure that takes place partially in the air this time.  Someone is stealing parts containing platinum from Stanwide Mining Equipment Company.  The problem is that no one can seem to figure out how it is happening.  The Hardy Boys get involved when they are taking a short cut through the country and a plane almost crashes on the roof of their car.  Soon the Hardy Boys are trying to learn the source of ghostly whistling and voices.<br /><br />The Hardy Boys' investigation takes them to an island in the Caribbean Sea, a cave with multiple secrets, and a cabin in Montana.  This adventure also contains some of the most dangerous villains the Hardy Boys have encountered yet.<br /><br />The author continued the use of caves as an integral part of the story.  This book is the eighth that uses a cave.  In this story the cave is quite large.  I am imagining that the United States is filled with caves, at least as far as this author is concerned.<br /><br />The author paced the last couple of stories nicely, keeping the action going and with sufficient mystery to make a reader want to continue onward.

It is winter and the boys have received permission from Elroy Jefferson to stay at the cabin he owns on Cabin Island.  The boys received this permission because they recovered Mr. Jefferson's car in \\"The Shore Road Mystery.\\"<br /><br />The boys and their friends Chet Morton and Biff Hooper go to Cabin Island to check it out.  They journey on an ice boat the Hardy Boys built themselves.  A brief side note.  I had always thought of ice boats as being small.  The Hardy boy's ice boat is large enough to hold four people and enough supplies to stay for a week on Cabin Island.  I think it is safe to say that the boat is quite large.<br /><br />Once on Cabin Island the four friends head off to see the cabin.  The soon discover footprints and a surly man chases them off the island.  The boys visit Mr. Jefferson to ask about the man.  Mr. Jefferson believes it is Hanleigh, who has been asking Mr. Jefferson to sell him the island for some time.  While visiting with Mr. Jefferson the boys learn that Mr. Jefferson has a grandson, Johnny Jefferson, who has disappeared from his school.  Johnny is fifteen years old.  The boys also learn that Mr. Jefferson had a collection of highly valuable medals that were stolen some years before.  The Hardy Boys have a new mystery!<br /><br />During their trips to and from the island the boys also encounter bullies who attempt several times to wreck their ice boat.  Eventually the boys realize that the bullies are trying to keep them from Cabin Island.<br /><br />As the story progresses the four friends encounter a ghost in the woods, and numerous attempts are made to drive them from the island.  The boys also encounter a blizzard, and have to make at least two rescues.  I also pointed out in my last review that the author seemed to have a fixation on caves, as the author had written five and now seven stories in a row that featured a cave.  The next story also has a cave important to the story.<br /><br />This story is an interesting Hardy Boys story.  The pacing is good, and the mysteries are kept simple, though the boys must work hard to learn the answers.

This book is one of the better books of the first eight.<br /><br />Note that this review is for the 1966 revision.  My understanding is that there is a later revision where the author replaced medals with stamps.  If that is true, it is unfortunate.

At the same time the boys are on the trail of a missing college professor.  It seems the further the boys travel in following the missing professor, the more suspicious characters they discover.  Some people they encounter who appear suspicious may not be, and others who appear to be uninvolved may be.  How will the boys learn where the missing professor is located?<br /><br />During the boys investigation they come across a huge complex of caves.  During their stay in the cavern the boys have their stuff stolen, and are threatened.  What could be so important that someone would want to chase the Hardy Boys away?<br /><br />I have been a big fan of the Hardy Boys since I was a child.  However, I found this particular book to be less enjoyable than some of the other books.  The main reason is that the author appeared to know little about the military and military construction, and his description of the sabotage at the radar site would have involved the FBI and much heavier security, among other details.  However, if you can get over the minor annoyances, the basic story has some interesting twists.<br /><br />As I noted in my review of Hardy Boys #6, \\"The Shore Road Mystery,\\" the author seemed to have a fixation on caves.

It appears as though the car thieves regularly elude the police even when the police are hot on their trail.  When the Hardy Boys put their minds to the mystery what they discover is that the car crooks are even cleverer than they could ever have suspected.<br /><br />We follow the Hardy Boys as they try to prove that the Dodds, who car thieves framed and then disappeared, had nothing to do with the thefts.  Eventually the Hardy Boys discover that the car thieves have plans far more nefarious than simply stealing cars.<br /><br />While searching for the car thieves the boys also learn that there is a Dodd family mystery involving missing treasure.  The boys also wonder what the mysterious spider-man has to do with the mystery.  And why does a certain farmer always seem to be plowing his fields without lights in the middle of the night?  As the story nears its conclusion the boys will use a car as a Trojan horse to attempt to trap the thieves.  What will happen when the thieves discover the boys?  There are many mysteries for the boys to solve.  The boys learn that their father has an important mystery of his own, but in the end it turns out that their father's mystery and theirs may be related.<br /><br />This mystery is one of the most intriguing Hardy Boys mysteries.  The author managed to change a simple car theft story into a puzzle for the Hardy Boys.  The author also mixed in additional story elements to be sure that it would be relatively difficult for the Hardy Boys to solve the mystery.<br /><br />As a side note, this mystery has a cave as a key element.  It appears that the author was in a cave mood, because caves appeared in each of the previous four stories, and continue to appear in the next stories.

I always thought Bayport must not be a very safe place with all the crime that seems to occur there.  Anyway, the boys are wandering around in the fog near Bayport when they encounter an old man who was accidentally shot by hunters.  The boys learn that the old man is Mike Onslow, who the boys were seeking because of his knowledge of the Lucky Lode area in Montana.  Their father is chasing criminals in the area and he was hoping that Mike could provide information about where the crooks could be holed up.<br /><br />Mike tells the boys about his time in that area as a gold miner.  Mike and three other miners were getting ready to leave their claim when Black Pepper and his gang jumped them.  One of the miners, Bart Dawson, had a plane nearby with the gold already on board.  Bart slipped away and took off.  When Black Pepper and his men followed Bart, the other three miners escaped from the cabin.  The miners were supposed to meet up later to split the gold.  However, Bart Dawson disappeared.  Mike then drew the boys a map of the area.<br /><br />The boys travel to Montana through Chicago.  In Chicago, men posing as their father's associates kidnap them.  After a harrowing escape and stupid actions on the part of the kidnappers, the boys were able to continue on their journey.<br /><br />In Montana it appears their adversaries are ruthless, and their adversaries attempt numerous times to stop the Hardys from investigating their activities, including trying to kill the Hardy boys and their father.  As the story proceeds, we learn that there may be someone telling the criminals about the Hardys' plans.  Who can the Hardys trust?  The boys also fend off assassins, a fall from a cliff, and a cave-in in their most harrowing adventure yet.  All the while the boys and their father must discover the hideout of the criminals, and, as you have already guessed, where the gold from the plane is located and what happened to Bart Dawson.<br /><br />The Hardy Boys face many mysteries and yet the author managed to clearly explain how the mysteries did or did not relate to each other.  Each of the first five Hardy Boys mysteries were quick, enjoyable reads, and I would recommend them for children in the age range of about eight through whatever age the series holds their interest.<br /><br />Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent.  The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14.  As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12.  I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be.

The fourth book raises the ante once again by having at least four, apparently different, mysteries.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book the boys take their new boat, the Sleuth, out on the bay.  While they are cruising on the bay another boat nearly rams them.  They would have chased the boat but the steering on the Sleuth broke, and the boys ended up going around in circles.  It turns out that the boat that nearly rammed them had a purpose for doing so, that we do not discover until the end of the book.<br /><br />Soon after, the boys prepare to go to Callie Shaw's costume party.  Frank likes Callie romantically and she is a recurring character in the Hardy Boys stories.  They encounter another mystery as it appears that men in Mr. French's costume shop appear to be threatening Mr. French.<br /><br />Returning home the boys frighten their Aunt Gertrude with their costumes.  Aunt Gertrude is yet another recurring character in the series.  Soon the boys are off to the costume party on their motor cycles.  On the way they realize that the bank is being robbed.  They follow the criminals until they lose them at the docks, where they hop into a boat and escape into the fog.<br /><br />After notifying the Coast Guard, the boys gain permission from Chief Collig to search for the criminals in the Sleuth, but the boys discover the Sleuth has been stolen!  The boys search for the bank robbers in Tony Prito's boat, the Napoli, but are unable to find them in the thickening fog.  The boys return home, explain to their father everything they saw at the bank and during the chase, and then head out to the costume party.<br /><br />The next day the boys awaken to learn that Chet Morton and Biff Hooper never made it home from the party.  The boys not only have to learn who stole the Sleuth, but where their missing friends went, and who robbed the bank.  As the story develops the boys learn that expensive radios that may have been stolen are turning up.  Lastly, a hermit on a tiny island with a shotgun threatens the boys.<br /><br />The Hardy Boys face many mysteries and yet the author managed to clearly explain how the mysteries did or did not relate to each other.  Each of the first four Hardy Boys mysteries were quick, enjoyable reads, and I would recommend them for children in the age range of about eight through whatever age the series holds their interest.

In this story we have the boys threatened with guns and their father caught in an explosion.  There also appear to be multiple mysteries from the beginning of the book.<br /><br />Chet Morton, a good friend of the Hardy boys, is on his way to purchase a new microscope when they save a boy's life.  The boy, Ken Blake, is a delivery boy for Elekton Corporation, which does top secret work on military rockets.  After finding Ken's package, he is on his way to complete his delivery.<br /><br />Shortly after saving Ken's life, the boys see Oscar Smuff, who thinks he is a detective, trying his cartoon best to shadow a man with a suitcase.  Soon Oscar Smuff attempts to arrest the man, but then just as quickly backs down.  Though Smuff had the wrong man, the boys soon learn that there is a counterfeiter operating in the Bayport area.  Shortly after, the boys pick their father up from the railroad station and learn that he is working on a case that he is unable to talk about.  Through much of the book we wonder whether their father is working on the counterfeiting case, and I will leave the reader to discover the rest.<br /><br />Soon after, the boys spot a mysterious character riding away from their house on a bicycle, late at night.  The boys try to run after the mysterious character, but are unable to catch up.  What they discover is a note in their mailbox that says that the case should be given up, or there will be danger for the Hardy family.<br /><br />We soon learn that the Elekton facility is new, and Elekton refurbished an old mill to act as part of the guard house for the new operation.  We soon learn that there is something unusual going on in the old mill, though whether the unusual activities seem to have nothing to do with the counterfeiters.  However, one day Ken Blake goes to the hardware story of Tony Prito's father and helps a man in a van pick up some materials, and the money that Ken Blake uses to pay Mr. Prito includes a counterfeit twenty dollar bill.  The Hardy Boys do not believe Ken is involved in the counterfeiting operation, but they are wondering how Ken came into possession of the bill.<br /><br />As the story evolves, we learn the old mill has a unique warning system, a hidden room, and a secret tunnel.  We also learn that there is more than a single mystery in this book, which makes for interesting reading as the reader attempts to guess who the bad guys might be, and what their motivations are.<br /><br />As in the previous story, their father is again in a dangerous situation and faces the possibility that he might be seriously injured or even killed.  At one point things even look serious for the Hardy Boys.  However, the crooks always seem to forget that the Hardy Boys and their friends are highly resourceful and work as a team, and just when things look the darkest the good guys arrive.<br /><br />The exciting conclusion of this book involves a show down between the criminals and the Hardy Boys, and the criminals have a gun.  It turns out that a portion of the mystery involves a nefarious plot that the reader can have the pleasure of discovering.<br /><br />The Hardy Boys have been revised since their original publication number of decades ago.  While the original stories may have been too outdated for modern children, the revisions have weaknesses in that some of the more interesting parts of the stories were removed as part of the revision.  The stories could use another revision to restore the depth of the stories and provide some modifications of the stories for current audiences.  For example, in this story Chet could be purchasing a new computer.<br /><br />While the Hardy Boys have not aged well, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent.  The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14.  As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12.

Some of the seven books in this series were very good, even excellent.  I believe my favorites were the first, \\"The Gunslinger,\\" and the fourth, \\"Wizard and Glass.\\"  I think the book I struggled with the most was the fifth, \\"Wolves of the Calla.\\"  This book falls somewhere in the middle, with the exception of the ending.<br /><br />I am loath to speak much of the details of this book.  If I do I threaten to reveal things that are better for the reader to discover.  Discovery is one of the most important parts of reading a story.  In the case of this story, King specifically states in his afterward that this book, and the series by extension, should be read not for the ending, but for the journey, and I agree.  The ending has little meaning unless you have taken the journey through the seven books, one, by, one.  However, I must reveal a few details to entice you to start and carry on through the series.<br /><br />We have followed the ka-tet of Roland Deschain, Eddie Dean, Susannah Dean, also known as Odetta and Detta and for a while as Mia, Jake Chambers, and Oy the billy-bumbler, for a long time.  The end of all things is, as is often the case in real life, sad.  The end of all things is bound to cause some to see the wisdom in the ending, and others to cry foul.  In this rare case I must admit that I agree with Stephen King that the story has written itself, and the end is the only way it could have ended.  I tried considering other alternative endings, only to discover that none of them worked.  I will get back to the ending shortly, because there is a corner that King painted himself into early on in the series that provided the basis for the ending (which I still will not reveal).<br /><br />This story is long and complex.  We pick up the story at the time of Mordred's birth, and the escape from Fedic.  The story travels back and forth between New York, Maine and the Tower keystone world.  We learn that Mordred is complex.  We learn of Ted Brautigan, from the book \\"Hearts in Atlantis,\\" though it is not important to read that book to understand this story.  We also see Roland and his ka-tet stop the Breakers from destroying the beams, as we knew they must.  It is from this point that Roland and the ka-tet then go forward to seek the Dark Tower.<br /><br />Mixed into this story are a multitude of complexities, which I have little time and even less desire to reveal.  Roland travels to New York and meets characters previously introduced at the Tet Corporation.  We meet other characters with incredible powers, and see potential in them that Stephen King should also have seen, and either needed to explain away, or accomplish.  For example, why is it that Patrick did not draw himself a new tongue?  Further, Patrick should have had the ability to draw Susannah new legs.  While King often explains the weaknesses in his epic story as being ka, I think it shows that King struggled at times with the complexity of his own story.<br /><br />This book has the most action of any of the books, with some of the slowest interludes of the any of the books.  However, the interludes are somewhat necessary to allow the reader to comprehend what has happened, and to allow the reader to consider what might happen next.  This book also has some of the highest body counts of any of the books.<br /><br />Readers have complained about portions of the stories.  As one example, King built Mordred up and discussed him for hundreds of pages, and yet his final role was relatively short.  Yet, through Roland King revealed previously that most action is lots of preparation with little real action, and the showdown between Mordred and Roland went nearly as much as I thought it would, though I missed the importance of the associated consequences, which is where some disappointed readers missed the importance of Mordred.  It was the interaction between Mordred and Roland that lead to numerous consequences for Roland and the remainder of the ka-tet, and thus was the importance of Mordred to the story, not the battle between them.<br /><br />In the end, each reader needs to recall that the story has always been Roland's story.  Roland was always focused on a particular goal, and while Roland sometimes tried to be moral, he kept sight of that goal.  Roland's behavior through 4500 pages of story has been consistent.<br /><br />Recall also that King clearly pointed out that time moves linearly in the \\"real\\" world.  Yet, time in the keystone world of the Dark Tower does not.  Consider also that in one of the previous books that in the discussion of the failing of the beams that King pointed out that the magic that created the beams was failing, and the machines too were failing.  The question becomes, or should become, how can the magic continue to survive?  King created a clever way for the beams to live forever, or nearly forever, in spite of the potential for their failure.<br /><br />As for the angry reader, I am sorry that you are angry.  I am not angry, because the ending was disturbing, and yet satisfactory.  The fact that it causes readers to think, and perhaps even feel compelled to write to Stephen King, means by definition that King reached you.  It would have been more disturbing had people cared insufficiently to feel anything.  Before you allow your anger to color your thoughts longer, consider the philosophical ramifications of the ending, and then think even longer.  It was a very good, nearly great ending.<br /><br />I leave this review the way it all began, from \\"The Gunslinger,\\"<br /><br />\\"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed...\\"erous consequences for Roland and the remainder of the ka-tet, and thus was the importance of Mordred to the story, not the battle between them. <br /> <br />In the end, each reader needs to recall that the story has always been Roland's story.

The first of the revised Hardy Boys stories, \\"The Tower Treasure,\\" was relatively tame, even though there were a couple of moments of near danger.  In the second book in the series the danger is turned up; the bad guys have guns and they are not afraid to use them!<br /><br />Their father, the famous detective Fenton Hardy, invites the Hardy Boys on a case.  This time the Hardy Boys accidentally observe smugglers attacking a man on the ocean.  Before the boys can see what happens to the man they hear a cry from an abandoned nearby house, which is perched on a cliff overlooking the ocean.  Their search is fruitless, and on returning where they had left an expensive telescope, they discover the eyepieces are missing.  The mystery begins.<br /><br />The smugglers are bringing rare drugs into the country, by means unknown.  Fenton Hardy believes the leader of the smugglers to be a tough character named Snattman.  Fenton Hardy disappears during the investigation, leaving the boys with an even bigger mystery, and their mother with concerns regarding Fenton's safety.<br /><br />As happens often with the Hardy Boys, a group of their friends pools their resources to locate the smuggler's hideout along with who the smugglers are.  Along the way they discover that their father was kidnapped and held captive by the smugglers, and they may yet murder him!<br /><br />The exciting conclusion of this book involves the Coast Guard, secret passages, a mysterious cargo ship, and a man named Singh.  As the battle between the smugglers, led by Snattman, and the police, the Coast Guard, and Joe, Frank, and Fenton Hardy rages on, everyone is in danger because the smugglers have guns and are not afraid to use them.<br /><br />While the Hardy Boys have not aged well, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent.

The Hardy Boys were originally written decades ago, and even through at least two updates their age shows.  Yet, as recently as the 1960s I read the Hardy Boys books with great interest, and felt as comfortable with them as with most children's television shows of that time.  The only problem with the Hardy Boys is that there are far more challenging and exciting things for children to do today other than read about two boys who live in a land of make-believe that likely did not exist in their own original time, and certainly does not exist today.<br /><br />In this introduction to the Hardy Boys series, bonds and jewels have been stolen from Mr. Hurd Applegate.  Mr. Applegate thinks it is Mr. Robinson, the gardener and general handyman.  Fenton Hardy, the boys' father, Frank and Joe Hardy and all their friends do not believe that Mr. Robinson had anything to do with the robbery.  The Hardy Boys begin their very first case!<br /><br />After a series of events, including the recovery of Chet Morton's stolen car, one of the boys nearly plunging to his death in Mr. Applegate's house, and the actual death of a criminal, the boys suddenly realize where the jewels and bonds might be found.  Along the path to finding the bonds they also encounter would-be detective Oscar Smuff and a hobo who would challenge them for the treasure.<br /><br />While the Hardy Boys have not aged well, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent.

There were 33 books in the series, written between approximately 1953 and 1970.  This particular edition is book #32 in the series.<br /><br />The Happy Hollisters are somewhat of a relic of an era gone by.  The family consists of five children, Pete, Pam (Pamela), Ricky, Holly, and Sue, and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Hollister.  There are also Zip, a collie, and White Nose, a cat, who also had five kittens in the first book.  Mr. Hollister owns a store called The Trading Post, that sounds similar to general stores in days gone by.<br /><br />Throughout the series the children solve mysteries, usually as a family, including mom and dad.  In this book the children find a mysterious looking little man looking in their basement window, and soon discover a host of other mysterious individuals in their home town of Shoreham.  Mixed into this stew of mysterious individuals is the appearance of a flying saucer, and rumors of a monster at a nearby lake.<br /><br />As the story unfolds constant nemesis Joey Brill is implicated in at least one portion of the mystery, while misbehaving as he normally does.<br /><br />Ultimately the children discover a mystery that begins in a foreign land, only to end up practically in their back yard.  The children are able to not only help solve the mystery, but show a sort of ecologicaly awareness.  Note, however, that their awareness is slightly skewed as they discuss ownership of an endangered species.<br /><br />The Happy Hollisters series remains a reasonably good, if somewhat outdated, read for younger children, perhaps from ages 4 to 9.  I suspect that by age 9 most children will be more entranced by relatively more modern pursuits.  Also, many children may consider families of five children to be somewhat unusual and that may take some explaining.  These books may be an excellent way to introduce children to the changes that have taken place in our society over the past half century.<br /><br />One last word of caution.  These books are becoming very difficult to find, and thus their price varies substantially.  If you are interested in reading this series you may find editions without covers that sell for less than editions with covers.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy The Happy Hollisters.

The music was frequently ethereal and haunting, almost fragile in its delicacy.  While it may be impossible for most of us to do anything but hum along, here is a book of her music for the CD.  The music for all twelve pieces is included, along with a little background for each piece.<br /><br />Enya's music is so beautiful, airy and spiritual, that most instruments will yield an interesting interpretation.  However, there are some instruments that will be more suitable than others.  Keyboards of course, since much of Enya's music is on piano, but guitar, recorder, and violin are among the others that can keep various flavors of her music.  I myself prefer the haunting tone of the recorder, keeping in mind that you have to modify the music to accommodate the range of the recorder.  I prefer a deeper voiced recorder, I have a tenor recorder, because the music can be slowed for the more haunting songs and I like the emotion that you can put into a song with a tenor recorder.<br /><br />As with any music, there are challenging pieces and places, but there is also easier music to play from this CD.  That the pace of much of the music is relatively slow helps for learning and musical interpretation rather than the much faster pace of rock or even a lot of classical music.  Learning to play music from this CD is a fascinating way to enjoy Enya's music.	2005-02-16

While this book is perhaps one of the lesser books in the series, it is a substantial improvement over the plodding \\"Wolves of the Calla,\\" which seemed to drag on endlessly to reach the action-packed ending.  No such worries in this page turner, which, while it has its repetitious moments, keeps moving relentlessly through a single day to a cliff hanger ending that requires a reader to have the final book, \\"The Dark Tower,\\" handy so that you may continue reading the story of the ka-tet and the events surrounding the birth of Susannah/Mia's \\"chap.\\"<br /><br />At the end of \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" Mia had taken control of Susannah's mind and taken the confusion and aftermath of the battle with the Wolves to grab black thirteen and use the door in the cave to return to New York.  There Mia and Susannah battle for mental control of Susannah's body.  The novel follows Mia and Susannah as they interact throughout the day, eventually ending up at the Dixie Pig to deliver Mia's chap, which they must do or Susannah/Mia will die.  The interesting thing about the interaction between Susannah and Mia is that nearly all of it is in Susannah's head; there is very little that passers-by would notice of these interactions, if any.

If you liked the first three Lemony Snicket books, \\"The Bad Beginning,\\" \\"The Reptile Room,\\" and \\"The Wide Window,\\" available individually and in a boxed set, you will enjoy the next three books collected in this set, \\"The Miserable Mill,\\" \\"The Austere Academy,\\" and \\"The Ersatz Elevator,\\" even more.<br /><br />The first of the three books is \\"The Miserable Mill.\\"  The orphans have moved to another relative, this one the owner of the Lucky Smells Lumbermill in the rundown town of Paltryville. I'm not sure of the relationship of this new person to the children, and we really see very little of this uncaring person in any case. Furthermore, we never know his name; he is just called \\"Sir\\" or \\"The Boss\\".<br /><br />The children toil in the lumber mill from the time they arrive in Paltryville. Soon they have splinters and are tired and hungry, because they get nothing for breakfast, almost nothing for lunch, and casserole for dinner. There are multiple labor and child abuse laws violated in this book, but perhaps it might make some readers more appreciative of what they have.<br /><br />As has happened in the previous three books, the children are able, principally through their own efforts, to overcome the bad guys. Unfortunately someone does die in a gruesome, though not detailed, way. Once again the children are on their way to another home.<br /><br />Of the four books thus far, this one was my least favorite. The style of the books is such that bad things happen to these children on a regular basis, but in this book it seems as though bad things are happening to nearly everyone. This book is very depressing. I was also a bit annoyed with the extremes that the author went to in his exaggerations.<br /><br />The fifth book in the saga implements several changes, all for the better.  The first change is that we are no longer with a relative. Instead, we are at Prufrock Academy, a boarding school. Secondly, the Baudelaires acquire two friends at this new school. There are additional positives. They actually get to eat, they get to study, and they get to read. For a moment you might actually think that things are looking up for the Baudelaires. Ah, but for those familiar with the series, you know that can't be true.<br /><br />If the Baudelaires violate any of a series of bizarre rules they must endure a series of equally bizarre punishments relating to their meals. Included in this list of punishments is loss of silverware, loss of a cup, though you still get your drink, it's just in a puddle on your tray, and even having your hands tied behind your back at mealtime.<br /><br />As you have probably also guessed, Count Olaf does eventually show up. However, Count Olaf does not immediately try to spirit the children away from Prufrock Academy. Instead, he has them exercise nightly, all night long. The children try to figure out his scheme all the way up to the point where he does execute his scheme, and I can say no more or you will miss all the fun.<br /><br />In this book the children meet triplets who are now twins because one of the twins died. The five children become good friends because they are all orphans. They all get along well and work together to try and beat Count Olaf. However, the children are at the mercy of Count Olaf almost from the point he shows up to nearly the end of the story.<br /><br />The children have usually escaped from Count Olaf due to their own abilities.  This time the children are saved due to a combination of fortunate circumstances, including the help of their new friends. We do not find out where the children are going next at the end of this book, but of course we know that they will have another home in \\"The Ersatz Elevator\\".<br /><br />In \\"The Ersatz Elevator\\" the Baudelaire orphans move in with a non-relative in a penthouse apartment. While you might think that a penthouse apartment (which has something like 71 bedrooms) and kitchens, and sitting rooms, and on and on, would be a lovely place to live, you would be thinking wrong.<br /><br />This time the problem is that Esme Squalor (the sixth most important financial advisor in the city) and her husband Jerome are way too hung up on what is \\"in\\". Esme must go to only the \\"in\\" restaurants; she must wear only \\"in\\" clothes, which includes the children, and on and on. Unfortunately, being \\"in\\" also means multiple compromises in terms of comfort. For example, the penthouse is on the top of a building with 66 stories, and elevators are \\"out\\". So the Squalors and the Baudelaires must walk up and down the 66 stories each time the go in to and out from the building. They certainly received sufficient exercise. Before I forget, orphans are also \\"in\\".<br /><br />Of course, we know that Count Olaf must eventually show up, and he does. However, there is a mystery. We find that Count Olaf went up to the apartment and did not later leave the building. Therein lays the crux of the mystery for this story.<br /><br />This story climaxes with the children running briefly into old friends, and then losing them again. They also nearly catch Count Olaf, again. In the end, the children are forced to find a new home once again. Unfortunately I am unable to tell you more, because Lemony Snicket, should he ever escape from his current predicament, would hunt me down and provide me with agony should I reveal the end of this Baudelaire tale. Suffice it to say that the Baudelaires have their best adventure yet, with even better to come.<br /><br />This box set is a great way to collect this series if you have found that you like the unconventional way the Lemony Snicket has written these books.  I recommend them cautiously, and principally for children 8 or 9 or above.ould be a lovely place to live, you would be thinking wrong.  <br /> <br />This time the problem is that Esme Squalor (the sixth most important financial advisor in the city) and her husband Jerome are way too hung up on what is \\"in\\".

US	44759540	R15VIFG3DUMGC4	1880418568	446733041	Wolves of the Calla (Dark Tower)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Doing Time in the Calla	Stephen King set the pacing and style of this series with the first four novels in the series.  I have read each book and thought that the next was better than the last because he continued to provide interesting new insights and tension, and his tendency to write stories within stories is an interesting way to give a reader more bang for the buck.  However, \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" is quite different from the previous four books in significant ways, and the differences make this book the least book of the series thus far.<br /><br />The ka-tet has survived \\"Wizard and Glass,\\" an amazing book where we learn of one of the most important events in Roland Deschain's past.  We join the ka-tet soon after meeting a bizarre character more than a little familiar to fans of the \\"Wizard of Oz.\\"  The ka-tet is entering the lands of the Calla, an arc of communities that are adjacent to Thunderclap.<br /><br />Calla Bryn Sturgis is one of the towns of the Calla, and Andy the robot has warned Calla Bryn Sturgis that the Wolves are coming.  Each time the Wolves come they kidnap one-half of each twin pair of children.  The children eventually return, but they do so \\"roont,\\" or brain damaged.  The ka-tet of Roland of Gilead, Eddie Dean, Susannah Dean, Jake Chambers and Oy the bumbler are entreated to provide aid and succor to the town, thus being required by the code of the gunslingers to stand against the Wolves if it is possible to do so.<br /><br />The next several hundred pages of the book are devoted to meeting Donald Callahan from \\"Salem's Lot\\" and learning how he arrived in the Calla, and the various intrigues surrounding the characters in and around Calla Bryn Sturgis.  There is also an unusual introduction of Stephen King into his own story.  Much of the story provides development of the characters of the ka-tet, in addition to the characters of the town.  In considering other Stephen King books, this one is written somewhat like \\"The Girl Who Love Tom Gordon,\\" only longer.<br /><br />The story is well written.  The character development is well done.  However, it seemed to me that perhaps some of this development could have continued as the ka-tet continued on their quest for the Dark Tower.  The result of delving into the characters of so many people in the Calla and of the ka-tet is that the pacing of the story slows down very much as compared to previous books in the story.  The problem for readers is going to be that you really need to read the previous four books to get here, and if you prefer character oriented novels over action novels, you are unlikely to reach this point in the series.  Conversely, fans of action-oriented novels or novels where there is a strong element of the bizarre will reach this novel and be less satisfied than with the previous books.<br /><br />Another problem with the story is that King spent so much time on character development and giving so many hints that I had guessed the nature of the Wolves and several other important details well before the characters in the story made those discoveries.  The best surprises come when you discover things at the same time as characters in the stories, not well in advance.<br /><br />I also found the introduction of contemporary elements into the story, which you will have to read to see what I mean, to be amusing, though occasionally a little bizarre as I wonder at the motivations people might have to do certain things.<br /><br />The five books in the series thus far are nicely tied together, and well written.  I enjoyed \\"Wolves of the Calla,\\" but I found this novel to contain less of what I typically enjoy in a Stephen King novel, and found the pace to be tedious at times.  I provide a cautious recommendation for this book given the extensive amount of time King spends on character development, with only brief moments of action until the last fifty or so pages, where he finally moves beyond second gear into action.  I am looking forward to \\"Song of Susannah,\\" because the very end of this book sets up that novel, and I am hoping the pace picks up that book, which is much shorter than \\"Wolves of the Calla.\\"<br /><br />The fifth book adds another 700+ pages to the epic Dark Tower series, pushing the total page count toward three thousand pages.  The cross time and space dimension epic is intriguing and usually exciting, and I yet wonder how Stephen King will tie it all together in the seventh book, \\"The Dark Tower.\\"  I recommend this series to fans of fantasy and science fiction, as this series combines elements of both.Susannah,\\" because the very end of this book sets up that novel, and I am hoping the pace picks up that book, which is much shorter than \\"Wolves of the Calla.\\" <br /> <br />The fifth book adds another 700+ pages to the epic Dark Tower series, pushing the total page count toward three thousand pages.

The five members of the ka-tet, Roland of Gilead, Jake Chambers of New York, Eddie Dean of New York, Susannah Dean of New York, and Oy, are on Blaine the Mono, heading for certain doom unless they can ask Blaine a riddle that Blaine is unable to answer.  After a harrowing and narrow escape from Blaine, the ka-tet find themselves in a Kansas that none of them knows, but which readers of \\"The Stand\\" will find quite familiar.<br /><br />At long last Roland tells the ka-tet of a story that has haunted him his whole life, a story involving his deepest love, Susan Delgado.  This story turns out to be a novel within a novel, absorbing most of \\"Wizard and Glass.\\"  In this story we learn how Roland and his two best friends, Alain and Cuthbert, come to the town of Mejis and prevent minions of The Good Man from capturing petroleum to power engines of destruction against Gilead.  While they were unable to prevent what ultimately happened to Gilead, they were perhaps able to slow down the inevitable.  As the reader will learn, they had other effects on happenings in Gilead.<br /><br />The importance of this story is that we learn of Roland's past, and why he is such a haunted individual.  We learn that Roland's commitment to the Dark Tower is greater than his commitment even to his own love.<br /><br />The Dark Tower series has achieved phenomenally epic proportions with this book.  The number of pages in the series approaches two thousand at this point.  The story is complex, and we are fortunate to be able to have all seven novels available, versus when I read the first three as they came out, only to have to wait five years for the fourth, and then at least another five for the fifth.

In the previous book we thought we would meet the three team members who would join Roland in his quest, but one of the members met his demise after Jack Mort's evil was uncovered.<br /><br />In this book Susannah Dean (nee Walker), Eddie Dean, and Roland of Gilead seek the beam that will lead them to the Dark Tower.  They soon encounter an enormous bear that turns out to be more than meets the eye.  After their exciting encounter with the bear the trio back trails the bear to its home, and encounter a variety of support critters that are also more than meet the eye.  The trio also finds the beam that will lead them to the Dark Tower.<br /><br />A little down the trail they meet the true third alluded to in \\"The Gunslinger,\\" none other than Jake Chambers.  In a short period the four members of the ka-tet encounter a beat up bumbler that they nickname Oy.  This group is the team that we follow onward to the dark tower.<br /><br />The ka-tet encounters a town of elderly people who warn the group against proceeding to Lud, the nearby big city.  However, the team believes they need to ride a train a good portion of the way to the Dark Tower.  They soon discover that the only remaining train is named Blaine, as Jake had been prophesying, unbeknownst even to himself, for some time.<br /><br />Once the ka-tet enters Lud, they discover a war that has been in progress for decades, or perhaps longer; a war so old that none even remember who the good guys and the bad guys are.  Jake is quickly kidnapped by a man who is vaguely reminiscent of a character in \\"Treasure Island,\\" but with a sadistic streak uncharacteristic of such a classic character.  The ka-tet splits up, with Eddie and Susannah proceeding to find Blaine while Roland goes to seek Jake.<br /><br />Roland eventually finds Jake, with the critical aid of Oy, after a series of adventures and a battle that will ultimately change the nature of Lud, and the pair meets with Susannah and Eddie at Blaine the Train's departure platform.<br /><br />Once the group are on the train, they soon discover that not only is Blaine a Pain, but he is insane.  The only way to prevent Blaine from flying off the end of the track and killing the ka-tet is to ask Blaine a riddle to which Blaine does not know the answer.  The tension mounts.<br /><br />Stephen King took a long time to get to the third book in this series, nearly 10 years from the first book.  It took him more than 10 more years to get to the seventh and final book.  However, the wait for the third book, and the fourth book, was worth it.  I recommend strongly that you read the first two books in the series before reading this book.  While it is not critical that you read the first book, you will understand far more about the characters by reading the first two.<br /><br />This particular edition has excellent art by Ned Dameron.  I have yet to see the edition with Michael Whelan's art.  However, Michael Whelan is an outstanding artist, and I would think that edition would be similarly impressive.  In any case, I think you would be well served to buy an edition of this novel with the artwork in it.<br /><br />Stephen King has created an epic fantasy series that rivals all previous series in scope.

Of course, 20+ years after \\"The Gunslinger\\" was written we know there are seven books in the series, and \\"The Gunslinger\\" was but an intriguing introduction.<br /><br />In \\"Drawing of the Three\\" we meet Roland of Gilead once again.  This time Roland is on a beach, not remembering exactly how he got there.  Roland soon meets \\"lobstrosities\\" that provide some rearrangement of Roland's body parts, also providing him with an infection in the process.  Roland also encounters a door that leads to...?  Through the door we recognize images and events in a world that appears very similar to ours, and very dissimilar to Roland's.  Roland soon discovers that he is seeing through the eyes of a person.  In this case, a drug addict by the name of Eddie Dean.<br /><br />Later Roland enters another door to meet a mentally disturbed woman by the name of Odetta Walker, also called Detta Walker.  Later yet Roland meets a man by the name of Jack Mort.  Through twists of time and space we will eventually find that Jack Mort knows Odetta Walker, in a most unusual way.<br /><br />As was foretold in \\"The Gunslinger,\\" Roland would have three companions to join him on his quest for the Dark Tower.  Indeed we meet three people in this book who the reader thinks could be Roland's three companions.  We learn a lot about those three people; all the while Roland battles his own demons and journeys back and forth between what appears to be our world and his.<br /><br />\\"Drawing of the Three\\" is an excellent second book in this series.

Such is the case with \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\\"  Rowling's skill as an author is improved over the first book, and her story is much more consistent and generally easier to follow.  Rowling also manages to keep track of the various elements left in suspense as the novel progresses to be sure she ties all the loose ends up before the story ends.<br /><br />The story begins at the Dursley's Privet Drive house, where Harry's muggle guardians live.  The story is hardly begun when we meet Dobby, a house elf.  Dobby tries hard to convince Harry to stay away from Hogwart's.  Dobby tells Harry that he will die if he returns to Hogwart's.  Harry's only enjoyment in life was his first year at Hogwart's and there is little doubt he will return for his second year.  Soon Harry's best friend Ron Weasley shows up to rescue Harry, and it seems Harry is close to returning to school.  Prior to returning to school, Harry sees strange things in Knock-Turn Alley, a black magic area associated with Diagon Alley, and he and Ron miss the Hogwart's Express.  Naturally missing the train is something that will not stop Harry and Ron from returning to school, which is a story in itself.<br /><br />Once back in school it seems it takes only a little while for strange things to begin to happen.  Students turn up frozen.  Even Mrs. Norris, Filch's cat, has turned up frozen.  Further, Harry keeps hearing voices in the walls speaking of killing and death.  Harry's proximity to many of these incidents soon leads many of the students to believe that Harry is responsible.<br /><br />Introduced in this story is a new character, Gilderoy Lockhart, who must be the essence of every obnoxious, stuck-up, self-centered person that Rowling has ever met.  While he talks a big story, he is all talk and less than zero action, as he makes nearly every situation worse.  Lockhart is so over-the-top that he was barely tolerable.  However, he does play an interesting role at the end of the story, and I somewhat enjoyed what happened to him.<br /><br />We also learn something of Voldemort and Hagrid's history, which is as interesting as you would think.  We also meet Aragog, a somewhat unique creature in the pantheon of creatures Hagrid has befriended.  There is still the creature that we have yet to see.<br /><br />This story is much easier to read compared to the first Harry Potter, as readers are now familiar with Rowling's built-from-scratch fantasy.  Further, while she has made the story significantly more complex than the first novel by introducing the Chamber of Secrets and the histories of various characters, the clarity of her writing keep the reader on track throughout the story.  Rowling even manages to include a number of bizarre incidents, assuming that anything more than witches and wizards would be bizarre.  Imagine, for example, asking a ghost how they died.<br /><br />Rowling keeps her fantasy fresh in this second story with much promise for the following novels.  For those who can read this story as a fantasy, they will find the story creative and interesting.  I recommend this book for everyone from age 8 to adult, and even some younger children may be able to handle the story.arely tolerable.

However, as an introduction to the numerous fields of science this book is an outstanding beginning.  This book would be most valuable for the aspiring young scientist in late elementary school through middle school.  A child may review each of the fields covered in this book, which encompasses physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, chemistry, and medicine, and determine whether science truly is for them, and, if so, which field of science.<br /><br />Even adult readers will find this book to be a great refresher for many of the topics covered in classes long gone.  Suplee manages to explain a facet of each of the topics he covers enough to provide a basic background, and yet does so in a way that does not talk down to readers.<br /><br />Since this book is a National Geographic book, you know that it will be filled with incredible photography to match each of the subjects.  There are pictures of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge that collapsed in 1940, shown in such a way that it captures what happened in just two photographs.  There are photographs of Mars and the stars, and even a rusty car.  Photographs of cells and the brain are also provided.  Even an excellent explanation of the bad effects of poor nutrition and what happens when you eat too much fat.<br /><br />This book is a good general science book that could help provide the start of a research project.  Others may use it as a coffee table book, particularly in the hardcover edition with the dust jacket on it.  A casual guest will be impressed with your scientific interests and your appreciation of good books.	2004-11-10

In Happy Valley Rasselas' every need is met.  He is fed and cared for and protected.  However, Rasselas is unhappy in Happy Valley.  Eventually he finds a man of the world who has come to Happy Valley and by the rules of entry, is now unable to leave.  Eventually Prince Rasselas, the poet Imlac, Princess Nekayah and her handmaid Pekuah find a way to leave Happy Valley to journey into the world.<br /><br />The travelers leave with a quantity of jewels so that they might find their way made easier, as poor travelers typically find their travels harsh.  They begin to visit many different kinds of people in an effort to find happiness and thus be helped in deciding their \\"choice of life.\\"  The group visit common people, shepherds, an astronomer, teachers, a wealthy man, and many others.  However, the group encounters an unexpected problem; they are unable to find a person who is happy.  Even people who appear happy often turn out to have complaints regarding their life.  The apparently happy wealthy man complains that others want his wealth.  The shepherds turn out to want to live somewhere else.  Everyone is dissatisfied with their lot in life.<br /><br />Adding to the complexity of their search is that people take advantage of the seekers.  Some people scam them out of their money.  The Princess and Pekuah are kidnapped by desert raiders seeking to ransom them.  It seems as though the world is a harsh place compared to Happy Valley.  The seekers wonder how anyone can be happy in such a harsh and unforgiving world.<br /><br />Rasselas is a philosophical tale that wonders about the nature of happiness.  However, be careful of your expectations because Rasselas does not provide any ready-made answers.  The answers are left to the reader.  My observation regarding Rasselas and his band of travelers is that those they encountered would have thought that Rasselas led a happy life because he and his group were able to travel freely where they liked, learning new things and meeting new people.  Little did the seekers realize that while they were searching for happiness they were happy.<br /><br />Rasselas provides an opportunity for a person of learning to contrast his life with those who seek to find something without that is truly within.  For those who look, the answer is there, including the answer to where happiness lies.  Rasselas was closer than he knew, but he knew not where to look.  Unfortunately the learned Imlac provide no assistance and, indeed, steered Rasselas further from the truth.<br /><br />Typically philosophy books are difficult to read because they tackle complex arguments in ways that are difficult to follow.  In the case of Rasselas the search for the choice of life and the search for happiness are told as a parable, making the reading somewhat easier.  However, Samuel Johnson wrote this story more than two centuries ago, and the writing style and vocabulary used are likely to be challenging for many.  Balancing the difficulty in reading the story is that the story is not long.<br /><br />Considered by many to be a classic, here is a book that anyone who has styled himself a philosopher or just a seeker after truth should read.t Rasselas led a happy life because he and his group were able to travel freely where they liked, learning new things and meeting new people.

US	44759540	RYVWAYB4M0F02	0743457358	796500127	Everything's Eventual: 14 Dark Tales	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Good to Great	Several of the short stories in this collection appear to be vignettes; something that could have been part of a much larger story, but instead became a scene in the life of the characters.  Some of the stories that try to be clever (e.g., \\"That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French) end up getting caught in their \\"gee see how clever I am\\" storylines and ended up being a disappointment to me, particularly as I had that one figured out about halfway through.  One story, \\"The Road Virus Heads North,\\" I remember very well as being very similar to a story from Rod Serling's \\"Night Gallery\\" TV series.<br /><br />Getting past my complaints, there are some very good stories.  Perhaps the best story in this collection is an entry based on the characters from the Dark Tower series, \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria.\\"  I was fascinated by this story, and occasionally chilled, from beginning to end.  Even after I realized the nature of the sisters I was still chilled.  Stephen King tells this story at his best.<br /><br />\\"Autopsy Room Four\\" bears a strong resemblance to another movie or TV show I saw a long time ago about a paralyzed man, but King manages to spice this one up and I admit that while I was expecting an all-too-familiar story, I enjoyed the ending.  \\"The Man in the Black Suit\\" also provides you with a similar feeling to some of Nathaniel Hawthorne's stories, but again with a nice twist at the end.<br /><br />\\"All That You Love Will Be Carried Away\\" left me somewhat dry.  I never cared about the main character, was somewhat puzzled by many of his motivations, and became somewhat bored.  The central point of enjoyment in this story was his interesting hobby.  \\"The Death of Jack Hamilton\\" is well written, with very good visualization, but do not expect this to be other than the tale of how a gangster's life ends.<br /><br />\\"In the Deathroom\\" is a story that could have been on \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents.\\"  The story is vaguely disturbing, and the situation hopeless for the protagonist.  At first you even momentarily wonder who the protagonist is.  Then you wonder why you are watching a show about this person, as his situation seems so inevitable, and the inevitability makes you squirm as you long for hope.  A nicely executed story with a very Hitchcockian ending.<br /><br />\\"Everything's Eventual\\" is a very clever story that could easily be the basis of a novel.  After \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\" this story is one of my favorites.  The central character has a talent that is somewhere between science fiction, fantasy and the paranormal.  The life the central character, Dink Earnshaw, leads is quite - shall we say bizarre?  I would rather the reader discover how he came to be earning nearly nothing while having everything a person could want, and why he dumps the remainder of his money into the storm drains at the end of each week.<br /><br />\\"L.T.'s Theory of Pets\\" is a little bizarre and twisted, and probably because I spent at least a little while trying to understand what the ending meant means that the story did what King intended.  It matters not that the story had a rather ambiguous ending, just that the story makes you think.<br /><br />\\"Lunch at the Gotham Caf&eacute;\\" is gloriously bizarre and surreal, a juxtaposition of the real and the unreal.  As the story progresses I felt a dreamlike quality to the telling, wondering whether I was going to wake up at some point.  Fortunately, or not, the story maintains the surreal feeling to the ending that surprised me by being different from what I expected.  This story is another of the better stories in this collection.<br /><br />\\"1408\\" may have had some elements of H.P. Lovecraft, though I suspect such elements may have been unintentional on the part of King.  I enjoyed the story because King very pointedly tells you the problem with room 1408 has nothing to do with ghosts and the supernatural.  That room is just wrong.  I considered this story another of the better stories, good for generating a lot of thought after reading it.<br /><br />\\"Riding the Bullet\\" was previously available on the internet.  This story is in many respects a traditional ghost story, where you believe and fear, and then you realize it probably was not real, and then you find evidence that it may have been.  While this story could have been a bit boring because it is similar to a number of other ghost stories, King injected enough elements into it to keep it vigorous.<br /><br />\\"Luckey Quarter\\" is another of those stories that could have been showcased on a show such as \\"Twilight Zone\\" or \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents.\\"  This time our protagonist is an overworked hotel maid.  She has too many bills and too little opportunity.  However, a \\"luckey\\" quarter comes her way and suddenly opportunities present themselves; or do they?  This is a Stephen King story, after all.<br /><br />Each of these stories is well written.  There are several stories that are merely good, but there are even more stories that are very good or even excellent.  The collection could have been pared down a bit, but given that we each have different favorites, what I thought was a weaker story someone else may have thought great.  The collection is what it is.  Worth having in any King fan's collection or for anyone who enjoys a well-written tale.the better stories, good for generating a lot of thought after reading it. <br /> <br />\\"Riding the Bullet\\" was previously available on the internet.

Rowling's universe.  Rather than build upon existing mythology, J.K. Rowling started from scratch and created a self-consistent universe unique from all others.  The result is that some readers may initially attempt to fit their paradigms of magic, wizardry and witchcraft to Rowling's story, and become frustrated until they wipe away those paradigms.  It is for this reason that children enjoy Rowling's universe so well.  They have yet to acquire the preconceived notions of adults, and Harry Potter is so fun to read that they fall into the story immediately.<br /><br />Harry Potter is the stereotypical of the classic nerd.  He wears broken glasses, his clothes fit poorly, and he is put down by his aunt and uncle.  Into this rather mundane and pitiless world comes a mysterious letter from a place called \\"Hogwart's. \\"  Suddenly Harry realizes there is more to the world than living under the stairs, and we travel the road to knowledge and a better life with Harry because we want to BE Harry.<br /><br />When Harry was a baby he encountered Voldemort, considered to be an evil wizard.  Voldemort was nearly destroyed in the encounter and Harry Potter became famous, even though he was removed from the world of magic until he turned 10 years old.  Unfortunately, Harry's parents did not survive the encounter and thus Harry came to live with his cruel aunt and uncle, both \\"muggles\\" who despised and denied the existence of magic.<br /><br />Harry attends the first year of seven years at Hogwart's school, and learns there is a world of magic that exists all around, but which is protected by a multitude of resources lest the muggles become alarmed.  Harry learns much about magic and that there are mysteries in the world of magic that affect him.  Harry also begins to learn the amount of magical ability that he has inherited from his parents, and that with that power he has the ability to control the outcome of situations.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling has written a book that compares favorably with other children's book.  Her characters are likable and accessible, and her world is fun.  There are moments of amusement and moments of fear, and children of all ages should find this book a treat.  Highly recommended reading for anyone over the age of 8 years old.hat he has inherited from his parents, and that with that power he has the ability to control the outcome of situations. <br /> <br />J.K.

However, this book is neither.  What Jim Collins and his staff of researchers did was to analyze 1,435 companies that had appeared in the Fortune 500 to find 11 companies with a specific set of characteristics.  A couple of the most key characteristics were that these companies had to have been good performers for a number of years and then gone through a transition phase where they achieved well above industry average in performance sustained for at least 15 years.<br /><br />Once these 11 companies were chosen along with comparison companies, Jim Collins and his research team looked for common characteristics between these companies.  What they believe they found they defined as:  having level 5 leadership; having the right people in the company; confronting the brutal facts of their situation; defining what a company is good at; discipline; and the flywheel effect.  Collins also discusses the role of technology with an interesting conclusion.  While you could likely have guessed some of what they found, Collin's assertion is that a company that has transitioned from good to great and sustained that performance would have each of these characteristics.<br /><br />What makes this book a great read?  The support Collins provides for his conclusions.  Collins rigorously assembled facts and then attempted to infer the common factors between the selected companies.  While you may argue whether the selected companies will be great in the future, or whether other great companies exist that also made a good to great transition, the fact remains that he and his team did not waver in their criteria and they were able to observe the common characteristics that are described in this book.<br /><br />The greatest difficulty with the book is that it does not provide a roadmap for any particular company to make the transition.  The reader is left to determine how his company might be able to achieve the characteristics of a good-to-great company, or perhaps, how to eliminate the characteristics of a company that would prevent the company from being great, or perhaps even good.  One general point of agreement is that each of the defined characteristics is worthy of achieving.<br /><br />There are a few weaknesses in book.  One question that we asked (the leadership team of my company) was whether level 5 leadership could exist with second tier management and not with the top leader.  Collins seemed to think that the top leader in the company needed to be a level 5 leader, but we thought that a level 4 leader with a strong level 5 leadership at the second tier could well accomplish the same goal.  We also looked at the recent stock market performance of the 11 companies chosen and discovered that more recently some of these companies had performed very poorly.  We believe that an effective follow up to this book would be an analysis of companies that went from good to great to good or less than good to see whether a failure in one of the identified factors was the cause of the drop.<br /><br />This book offers a lot of thought-provoking information.  It is a widely-read book because of the methodology Collins used in his data collection.  It helps that this book is well-written and a quick read.  Neither makes this book a perfect business book, but certainly the conclusions should make us all consider how we can make our companies better.

The book is divided into five portions.  The first portion takes Gary's past from his first drawings to syndication of \\"The Far Side.\\"  Along the path was a pre-Far Side comic called \\"Nature's Way.\\"<br /><br />In the second part of the book Gary offers his original sketches and captions in comparison to how the comics actually came out.  In most cases the final version was better, but not always.  At the end of this portion of the book is a short section titled \\"stories\\" that is what it says, comics with a lengthy caption that is at the very least a short story.  In some cases the caption could be a novel, if you think about the concept very long, which I do not recommend.  You might suffer further brain damage.<br /><br />The third part is really interesting.  It shows how Gary or newspapers made mistakes.  The mistakes were often subtle, sometimes blatant.  Some of the more interesting mistakes happened when the caption of adjacent comic was switched with that of \\"The Far Side.\\"<br /><br />The fourth portion of the book was humorous independent of the comics.  Gary offers comments from various people offended by his art.  Considering the art and the comments offered, I suggest that in many cases people saw something that was not there, which makes me wonder where THEIR mind was at.  In other cases, people need to remember that Gary is offering a perspective on the world, in comparison to how people see things.  It does not mean that Gary is interested in actually seeing the things in his comics happening; usually.<br /><br />The fifth and last portion of the book offers Gary's favorites.  I concur that most of them brought a smile to my face, and in a few cases an out right laugh.<br /><br />Gary Larson succeeds in thinking outside the box, something that he does with great regularity.  I suspect that he would be great at inventing.  Of course, he is a self-described nerd, and I believe it.  He also seems quite pleased that his comics find substantial popularity amongst scientists.  Probably engineers too.  If you think \\"The Far Side\\" is one of the greatest comics ever created, you will love this collection for its explanations.  I recommend this collection highly for Far Side fans.he would be great at inventing.  Of course, he is a self-described nerd, and I believe it.

There is one thing about any Calvin and Hobbes book, they are always funny.  They are funnier if you have children.  This edition has several classic sequences.  In one series Calvin duplicates himself, and mayhem ensues, all blamed, of course, on the duplicates.  Naturally Calvin has a unique way of getting out of trouble.  Calvin also has a rather entertaining time with his babysitter, who seems forever doomed to being outwitted by Calvin, even if she always wins in the end (and Calvin's parents always lose as they have to bribe her to come back).<br /><br />Of course there are always the ever-interesting Spaceman Spiff strips, usually involving either Calvin's teacher or his mother.  Calvin also appears in a number of strips as a carnivorous dinosaur, the Calvinosaurus.  As with any Calvin and Hobbes book, there are the inevitable interactions with Hobbes that extend from fighting and arguing to tender solitary moments.<br /><br />Because Calvin and Hobbes is a unique series it is difficult to compare to other series or books.  All the books I have are all generally of equal quality in terms of the stories.  I have a slight preference for the treasury books with their color strips, but Calvin and Hobbes are funny in color or black and white.  If you need a good laugh, you'll likely find it here.	2004-07-18

These stories are dark, and the evil characters are truly evil.  A number of reviewers have panned this series because they are dark, and because they often push the boundaries of what some of us may find acceptable for children to read.  It is because of the dark imagery that I have typically recommended that age 9 be a minimum age.  Some children may be unprepared for these books until later.<br />In the first three books in this series we learn that the three Baudelaire children, Sunny, the baby, Klaus, her brother, and Violet, a young teen, have lost their parents in a terrible fire.  The children are sent to live with their evil uncle Olaf, who has ulterior motives yet to be revealed in later books.  The children quickly learn how evil he is, and ultimately escape.  They next go to live with their uncle Montgomery Montgomery in \\"The Reptile Room,\\" only to be forced to move on again.  In \\"The Wide Window\\" the children live with an aunt who is afraid of everything, only to ultimately be forced to move on again, continually chased by the evil Count Olaf in a variety of disguises.<br />Book 11 in this series is soon to come out, and the original plan was for there to be 12 books.  These books are like potato chips.  Once you start one and find it intriguing, you will want to keep reading.  If you do not like the first book, plan to stop with the first.<br />This series is highly creative and many children 9 and older find them enjoyable.  My children read them as teens and loved them.  They did think they were different and unusual, and since they could not explain why I read them myself.  They are different and unusual, but they also introduce children to situations that have occurred to children in the real world.  A good way to introduce scary subjects.	2004-07-06

In this, the sixth book in the series, Diane Duane has Kit take the leading role with Nita initially more in the background.<br />In the previous book Nita worked very hard to save her mother's life.  Nita managed to prolong her mother's life as she fought cancer, but ultimately she succumbed.  The opening of this book finds Nita morose and grieving, and Kit is temporarily without his partner.  As it turns out magic has been rubbing off on Kit's dog Ponch, who has developed some interesting magical abilities of his own.  Kit works to discover the extent of Ponch's powers and the meaning of Ponch's powers.<br />While Kit is trying to figure out Ponch's powers he finds himself in the mind of Darryl, an autistic boy.  Darryl's mind is a continually changing and often surrealistic landscape of themes and imagery, often confusing, always fascinating to Kit.  Kit discovers that Darryl is in an intense and long-running battle with the Lone Power, a battle in which the Lone Power is extremely vicious and vindictive, for reasons that Kit will eventually need to discover.<br />While Kit and Ponch are learning about Ponch's abilities and Darryl, Nita has strange and sometimes bizarre dreams.  It takes some time for Nita and Kit to discover that Kit, Nita and Ponch are all interacting with Darryl.  The trio eventually discovers that Darryl has the Lone Power under control, but Darryl need not keep battling the Lone Power and Kit and Nita can show Darryl how to end the battles.<br />This book looks at autism from a very interesting and unique viewpoint, and describes the world as an autistic person might perceive it.

Dairine is restricted to the Solar System as punishment while Kit (Christopher Rodriguez) and Nita are off to the safest planet in the galaxy, Alaalu.<br />The other portion of the exchange program is that three aliens visit the Callahan household.  Two of the aliens, Sker'ret, an insectoid, and Filif, a tree-like being, are friendly in their own way.  The third alien, Roshaun, is humanoid and quite arrogant.  Dairine quickly learns quite a lot from the first two aliens, but the third has her puzzled as she tries her best to make friends with him.<br />While things appear to be going smoothly, the wizards on earth and the wizards away on Alaalu each discover there are problems.  The wizards on earth discover that the sun is sick, and that sickness is going to spill over onto planet earth, with catastrophic consequences.  Quickly we learn why those particular four wizards were sent to visit the earth.  On Alaalu, Kit and Nita feel as though something is not quite right with the planet.  How can there be anything wrong with a planet that is nearly paradise?  Kit and Nita discover the most insidious side-effect of a society without fear, including the fear of death.  How can they help the residents of Alaalu escape from the stagnation that they chose millennia ago?  Is it ethically right for Kit and Nita to change their world so much?<br />Diane Duane has seldom avoided deeply philosophical issues, but in this book she tackles an issue that has been discussed in many circles:  What are the consequences of a perfect society?  Further, if the perfect society caused the society to effectively stop evolving, should an outside agent \\"correct\\" the problem?  What choice would a reader make?  As Diane outlines the choices the reader discovers that the choice is not easy, regardless of how beneficial the outcome.<br />At some places this book is a little too philosophical, and this book is not light reading.

The first science fiction book I ever read was &quot;Time for the Stars.&quot;  From that point forward I was hooked on science fiction and my favorite author became and remains Robert A. Heinlein.  I purchased this book shortly after it came out, with more than a little trepidation.  For better or worse, I agree with the majority of the reviews.<br />This book is not a book as such.  It is more an outline of grander stories that required much more development.  In this book you can see many of the seminal ideas that Heinlein used in many of his later books.  In a few cases this story could easily have served as an introduction or part of the collection of Heinlein's works, especially for his future history series.  Thus, for Heinlein fans, and perhaps, more appropriately, to use the original source of the term &quot;fan,&quot; Heinlein fanatics, this book is a treasure of thoughts and concepts.<br />From a writing viewpoint the book is quite dated, and well away from the polish that Heinlein would apply to his later books.  The lead character, Perry Nelson, is gawky and uncomfortable, and it is difficult for us to relate to him.  Perry lived too far in our past, and even too far in Heinlein's past.  Technology has provided us with a perspective that makes this book a story of another era.  And yet, it has charm for those of us who grew up with Heinlein and bought every new book as it was published.<br />Heinlein was always an interesting writer, even if you disagreed with his philosophy or with his predictions.  Heinlein has said himself that the views of his characters are not always his views, which leads me to believe that often his lead characters were philosophical foils, promulgating an idea just to see how it would play out.  Though the results were sometimes uneven, and many stories come across as preachy, once upon a time many of the stories he told could only be told and sold as a science fiction story.<br />Heinlein was a great fan of the future.  He believed in traveling to the moon and beyond.  He believed that ultimately mankind will raise itself out of the muck to create something greater and grander.  He frequently pointed out and predicted that we have and would stumble along the way, but he was perpetually optimistic that we have a great and glorious future, if we will only reach out and touch it.  This book is the fuse that started it all; a beginning, and it contains no ends.  For the ends you have to read the rest of his books.<br />For those of you who do not know Heinlein, I beg you not to buy this book.  You will not understand it, you will not like it.  You will wonder why you didn't spend your money on something more valuable, like mulch for your garden.  If you loved Heinlein's books, and you have read all or most of those 40+ books, then I recommend this book to you.  You will grok it in fullness.

While Dairine has been a pest, as younger sisters (and brothers) often seem to be, Diane Duane was setting up Dairine for a special role.  A role Dairine gets a chance to fill in this book.<br />We discover early in this book that Dairine is an incredibly power wizard; much more powerful than either Nita or her best friend Christopher (Kit) Rodriguez.  Dairine's book of magic comes not in the traditional form of a book, but as a lap top computer, reflecting the improving state-of-the-art of computers in 1990 when Duane wrote this book.  Of course any computer owned by a wizard would have to be strange, and Dairine's computer exhibits characteristics that are decidedly different from any computer we mere mortals have experienced.<br />Dairine's Ordeal matches her incredible power.  She is tasked to bring an entire planet to self-realization and advancement to a higher state of consciousness, and she takes on the Lone Power with the support of her newly created and found friends.  I leave the details to the reader.<br />This book has a different flavor from the first two books in the series.  While the first two books had technology, this book exhibits a stronger science fiction or science fantasy influence.  Even with that influence the fate of the Lone Power remains strongly metaphysical and just a touch incongruous with the science fiction nature of the story.  The ending of the story relates, as with the previous two books, to the fate of the Lone Power, and thus must be metaphysical, and the ending confuses much of the effort Diane put into developing the science fiction aspect of the story.<br />Excluding the ending, this book is a captivating read and further develops the characters in the series.  While the second book stands acceptably well on its own, I recommend reading at least the first book in the series, \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard,\\" prior to reading this book.  Knowing the principal characters is helpful in coming up to speed with the storyline.<br />This book is another good entry in this series, but with a different flavor.  A solid four stars.mend reading at least the first book in the series, \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard,\\" prior to reading this book.

At the outset of the book Nita (Juanita) Callahan and Kit (Christopher) Rodriguez argue about the best way to clean up a waterway.  The argument seems petty because both are after the same goal.  However, there seems to be a communication gap between the two.<br />This event sends Nita on a voyage of personal discovery that intensifies when she learns that her mother has cancer.  For the first time since becoming a wizard Nita learns that even wizardry has limitations.  Even Dairine, her powerful and talented younger sister, is incapable of handling the cancer that is slowly taking their mother.  Dairine is justifiably angry at her own inability to kill the cancer, and realizes that to battle this demon will require a finesse that she does not possess.<br />Nita must go on a voyage of self-improvement that only she can undertake.  She must learn to recognize and find the kernel of a being, be it a world or a person.  Nita must learn to manipulate that core, to help it marshal the powers that the kernel represents and commands.  Only by manipulating the kernel does Nita have a chance to save her mother from cancer.<br />As the book develops Nita finds friends from other planets who have been manipulating kernels for some time.  Nita is also developing advanced skills as a wizard, and I can see the potential for Nita to advance in the wizard hierarchy.  Eventually Nita comes to realize that even with all she knows and with all her will that she still needs the help of friends, who come through for her when she really needs it.<br />I was quite surprised at the dark atmosphere of this book.  I wondered whether Diane Duane was calling on personal experience, battling a disease that we have so little understanding of in the only way she knows how.  It seemed to me that Diane caught a feeling, an emotion, quite well, which also made me wonder at the appropriate age range for this book.  I would recommend perhaps ages 12 and above, or perhaps even a bit more.<br />In spite of the dark atmosphere, I enjoyed this book and would rank it as perhaps the second best book in the series after \\"A Wizard Abroad.\\"  Because of how well Diane created the imagery of the fight with the cancer and Nita's battles with the Lone Power I give this book a solid five stars.<br />This story stands reasonably well by itself.  However, I recommend reading at least the first story in the series, \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard,\\" and preferably the second story, \\"Deep Wizardry,\\" prior to reading this book.  Reading the third book in the series, \\"High Wizardry,\\" adds little background information other than reinforcing the relationship between Nita and Kit.

Further her parents want her to take a break from wizardry.  Little do her parents know that the aunt they send Nita to visit is a wizard herself, and the Emerald Isle is filled with the residue of thousands of magical events.<br />In this book Diane Duane mixes the story of wizardry that began in \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard\\" with myths and legends of Ireland in an effective and intriguing way.  An ancient ritual must be re-enacted to return the land to rest.  In order to perform the ritual certain artifacts must be recovered.  However, some of the artifacts have gone missing, perhaps forever.  How can they be recovered in time to perform the necessary ritual?  Along the way Nita must visit dangerous parallel worlds where she can easily become killed, and where ultimately many of those who are part of the ancient ritual will become killed.<br />I prefer this fourth book in the series over the first three.  There is a chance to explore Nita's character in more depth along with her maturity into womanhood.  The mixture of her newly created Young Wizards mythology with the mythology of Ireland is interesting and fascinating.  The story is complex, and thus occasionally confusing to the unfocused reader, but a reader captivated by the story will be well rewarded with Diane Duane's best story in this series to date.  Well worth five stars.<br />This story stands reasonably well by itself.

This fantasy is particularly strong when children are in elementary school and they so often feel powerless or helpless.  Juanita (Nita) Callahan and Christopher (Kit) Rodriguez fall into this category.  Kit has been advanced a couple of grades in school, so he is teased for his intelligence and his size.  Juanita tends to speak her mind, which frequently gets her in trouble with the supposedly cool crowd.<br />Juanita is in the library one day, hiding out from the ever-present bullies, when she runs across a book titled \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard.\\"  At first Nita wonders whether the book is some sort of joke, or fictional.  After she reads the Wizard's Oath, she soon discovers that the book is remarkable in how it keeps itself up-to-date as information about the world and the skill level of its reader changes.  Nita also discovers that she has become a wizard.<br />Nita soon meets Kit and discovers that she is not the only wizard in the world.  One of the first requirements of being a wizard is to go on an Ordeal, which has a level of difficulty that that matches the power of the wizards involved.  Nita and Kit are quite powerful and they go up against the Lone One in a world he made to prevent the Lone One from unmaking the entire universe.  In the course of trying to keep the level of entropy in the universe at the lowest level possible, and keeping the Lone One from unmaking the universe, Kit and Nita find themselves in situations where they risk death.  At one point in the book it is only through the sacrifice of two remarkable beings that Kit and Nita survive their sojourn into the Lone One's world.<br />While Diane Duane wrote this story about children in elementary school, I feel that it is a very mature story in many ways.  This story does have a number of intense moments and may be unsuitable for some children under the age of 8 or 9.  Additionally, Diane's vocabulary may present an additional hurdle for some ages.  However, the story does not treat children as persons to be protected by adults, and the children find that they do have power to affect their world.  One balance Diane brought into the book is an extremely strong code of ethics.  Wizards must behave very morally or bad things can happen to them.<br />This book is a worthy introduction to the Young Wizards series and an enjoyable read.an additional hurdle for some ages.

In this story there is something disturbing happening deep under the ocean.  In order to prevent the world from being destroyed the Song of the Twelve must be sung.  Each of the singers in the song plays a role in a drama that dates back to prehistoric times.<br />Much of the story is devoted to learning about the history of the song and role the various original singers played, along with learning about each of the characters that are set to play the twelve.  This background leads into the singing of the new song.  Nita volunteers to play the part of the Silent Lord.  However, Nita did not realize at the time that she volunteered that the job of Silent Lord comes at a price, a very high price.<br />Skillfully woven into the background is resentment by some cetaceans that humans have been so careless with life and the ocean in general.  Whales can long for revenge in the universe of the Young Wizards.<br />Diane's tale is a fascinating look at life under the ocean as its inhabitants might perceive it.  At the same time Diane took the opportunity to have Nita and Kit continue to mature, both in life as well as their wizardry.  This tale is much darker than the first story in the series, and is meant for maturing young adults rather than children.  However, if you are in the mood for a serious story, you'll find this sequel to be better than the original and will make you long for the next book in the series, \\"High Wizardry.\\"	2004-06-18

If the novel proceeds in a direction so completely different from the direction we expect, and the difference is less than pleasing, then we become upset.  Such can be a reader's experience with this book.<br /><br />The book begins with an incredible amount of promise.  A strange rain begins one night, waking Molly and Neil Sloan from their sleep.  There is something strange happening in the world; something very strange.  The strangeness increases even more in the daylight.  Every element in the first portion of this book is intriguing and fascinating, and pulls the reader further along, seeking resolution and answers.  However, there comes a point when it seems as though Koontz loses track of his purpose, or perhaps he inadvertently communicated a different purpose in the first part of the novel than where the story eventually leads us.<br /><br />I would like to discuss what happens at the end of the story, but I would rather not spoil any more of the ending than necessary, so I'm going to be vaguer than I would prefer.  Koontz' story evolves into metaphysical contemplation and become more akin to the \\"Left Behind\\" books than to \\"The Watcher.\\"  I realize that Koontz has been writing for a long time, and he has yet to explore the subject matter of this book in the kind of depth that he does in this book, but the ending left me somewhat unfulfilled.  I really liked how the book was progressing, but the ending just seemed a bit too trite.  Further, there were a couple of things that I thought Koontz could have developed much more, but did not; quite strange given the current trend for 500+ page novels.<br /><br />The result is that I am mixed regarding this novel.  I would like to see Koontz take another shot at writing this novel with a different ending.  Of course, that is pure wish because it will not happen.  However, another author might yet take up the incredible beginning and create another story altogether.  The potential is there, because it was unrealized in this book.

King broke onto the scene with \\"Carrie,\\" and quickly followed up his initial success with a quasi-gothic story of a modern vampire.  King's story brought new life into stories of vampires, firing the memories of those who fondly remembered the TV soap \\"Dark Shadows.\\"<br />King sets his story in the small Maine town of Jerusalem's Lot.  King starts his story by detailing the recent and not-so-recent past of many of the denizens of Jerusalem's Lot.  It also becomes apparent to the reader that the residents of Jerusalem's Lot are so caught up in their own petty problems and evils, including nosing into the lives of others, that they are unable to see the real evil that has come into their midst.<br />Rising above the concerns of the typical townspeople are Ben Mears, a young author with thus far minor success in the publishing world, Mark Petrie, a boy who would have been remarkable in any setting, Matthew Burke, an aging teacher who wonders whether he has made any real difference in the world, and Father Callahan, a priest who either has lost his faith or is on the very edge of doing so.  While the team is small, they are the few who are capable of leading the fight against the vampire who is slowly taking over the town, person by person.<br />On the other side of the fence are Mr. Barlow and Mr. Straker.  We wonder early on whether there really is a Mr. Straker, and though we know the story of Salem's Lot well enough to know there is a vampire, we wonder whether we are going to be fooled by some literary slight of hand.<br />Stephen King's success in this story comes not from the tale of the vampire, but by imbuing Salem's Lot the town with life, which King was able to do so well because of his own personal knowledge of small town life in the northeast.  The reader must believe in the dozens of mundane individuals that inhabit the town; how absolutely normal it all seems.  Yet, there is an undercurrent of foreboding, because there are already bad things in this town long before the vampire arrived.  King has wrought a novel that is easy to dismiss at the beginning, but is rewarding for those that allow the characters to develop.<br />I consider this novel one of the best vampire novels ever written, and easily worth five stars.the town; how absolutely normal it all seems.

I think I actually have at least one more of the series in a box somewhere, but have yet to read it because I wanted to get the whole series before I started.  I would have been better off starting at the beginning.<br />The story is quite good.  I found myself zipping through the story from the beginning to the end.  However, without the background of the previous books, I know I was missing a lot.  Why was Flinx digging through computers on Earth?  Why was his background unknown to him?  I know, it was a big mistake to start a series with the last book, but many authors try to make their series books stand on their own enough that you lose little by not having read the previous books.  Forget about that premise here.  You need to read the previous books in the series to know what is going on.  I did appreciate the references to stories I have read, such as \\"Cachalot\\" and \\"Midworld.\\"  I enjoyed both novels and would recommend them.<br />I did enjoy the ending of this novel (which was awesome and excellent, and made me want to read about the alien ship - which is one of the best features of this book), but it left a lot of questions unanswered.  I also realized that the ending of the story is but a prelude to the next Pip and Flinx story because the chase is still on at the end of the book.<br />For now my rating is three stars, but only because of the hanging ending.  The story is well-written and fast-paced, but leaving the story for two years without a sequel seems like bad planning.  I should point out that the next Pip and Flinx book, \\"Sliding Scales,\\" is expected to be out later this year.  A well-written follow up to this book could easily change my rating to at least four stars and possibly five.	2004-06-16

Seawolf, is patrolling in shallow water in the Yellow Sea, trying to get information regarding a new communist Chinese nuclear ballistic missile submarine. The biggest questions the crew of the Seawolf are trying to answer are the size of the missiles the new submarine will carry and how many it will carry, the goal being to understand the strategic offensive capability of the submarine.<br />The Seawolf's crew evades several attempts by the Chinese to sink her, providing several tense moments in the early part of the book. However, due to an error in navigation, and more than a bit of arrogance on the part of the executive officer, the Seawolf finds herself in relatively shallow water with little more than auxiliary motive power. Soon the Chinese cleverly capture the Seawolf and her crew.<br />The United States can ill afford to have the Seawolf remain the property of the Chinese, knowing they will steal every piece of technology they possibly can. Further, after detailed consideration of communist Chinese motives and past record, high-level decision makers determine that it is unlikely that the Chinese will release the crew of the Seawolf. After pages of consideration, it's decided that the Seawolf must not remain in Chinese hands, and her crew must be freed. It's at this point that the setup for the bulk of the book ends and the real action begins. The remainder of the book details how the last two tasks are accomplished and how well they are accomplished, details which will remain for the reader to discover.<br />I enjoyed reading the book. I thought portions of the book were filled with suspense and reasonably believable action. However, I suspect that readers with significant knowledge of the military will likely find some plot holes and several discrepancies. My knowledge of Navy related equipment and techniques is cursory, at best, so I'm sure I missed plot holes that would be obvious to more knowledgeable readers. I did have several problems with the story. Not all the problems I had can be detailed here as a discussion would give away portions of the story. However, let me provide a couple of examples. First, the executive officer makes a critical and fundamental error in operation of the periscope. I know mistakes can happen, but improper operation of a periscope by the executive officer of a submarine would seem to me to be the equivalent of a pilot not knowing how to operate flaps properly. In another situation a fighter is expected to drop a bomb undetected in a heavily defended area. The explanation of how the fighter penetrated Chinese air space to drop the bomb without being detected, and further, getting away without being detected, was shaky.<br />I could point out several other details that were a bit of a stretch, but I should also point out that this book should be considered a military thriller, and as such some assumptions should be allowed to be made. I think the author made more than he should have made, which is why I gave the book only three stars, but during the action portions I was interested in what was going to happen next. I am also tempted to rate the book lower because of the somewhat banal ending, with which I disagreed. However, it was the author's prerogative to end the book as he did, regardless of whether I thought the actions of at least one character were inconsistent with that character's personality.<br />Military fiction can be difficult to write. The author spun an interesting tale that held me well enough to the end, with minimal distraction due to extraneous details. A light read as military fiction goes, I would recommend this book to those who enjoy military fiction unless you require exacting and accurate detail.have several problems with the story.

US	44759540	R3L2ZQNJHWLVD6	0553802496	471304969	Odd Thomas	Books	5	15	20	N	N	How Odd (but very good)	When I first started reading this book, I thought perhaps Odd Thomas was a bit slow, or mentally challenged.  As I continued to read, I realized that he was quite intelligent, but approached the world rather simplistically, perhaps even naively.  Odd has an unusual talent; he sees the dead.  You can imagine it would be quite disconcerting to see Elvis walking around in your hometown, looking as he did in life, with the same taste in clothes.  Unfortunately, the dead do not speak; at least, not to Odd.<br />It takes us only a little while to discover that something is wrong in Odd's home town of Pico Mundo.  Odd sees a very strange character that he dubs the \\"Fungus Man,\\" who is followed by a group of bodachs, which are spirit-like beings invisible to those of us that are unable to see the dead.  In Odd's experience the presence of bodachs is an indication that something bad is going to happen to someone, somewhere, soon.  Odd takes the opportunity to make use of a driver's license to break into Fungus Man's house, where he finds even more unusual and bizarre things.  Fungus Man has a fascination with serial murderers and violence.  The physical and psychic evidence mounts that something is going to happen in the town of Pico Mundo, and Fungus Man seems to be at the center of it.<br />Odd continues to gather evidence of Fungus Man's activities to help support action by the Police Chief of Pico Mundo, who is Odd's friend and who is aware of Odd's talents for seeing ghosts and bodachs.  As we follow Odd in his gathering of information throughout the story we discover that Odd is far from being a storybook character, having bizarre parents, one of whom is severely dysfunctional, if not insane.  Perhaps the biggest surprise is that Odd is so relatively nice and normal, except for being able to see dead people, when Odd had such weird parents.  We are also introduced to Bronwen \\"Stormy\\" Llewellyn, Odd's girlfriend and, in Odd's opinion, the most perfect and beautiful woman on earth.<br />Dean Koontz wrote this story perfectly, continuing to build momentum from the discovery of Odd's talent, to meeting Fungus Man, to several dramatic and important events through the culmination of the story, when he pulls it all together.  One other reviewer found fault with the introduction of Odd's parents late in the novel.  However, in real life, as in this novel, Odd was searching for information, and he thought he might learn something from his parents.  As it turned out, he learned a very important piece of information from his mother that aided him as the final events unfolded in the book.<br />Dean Koontz' recent novels have been a roller coaster of quality.  While his books have been readable, their consistency has varied significantly.  \\"Odd Thomas\\" stands out as the best novel that Koontz has written in quite a long time.  The pacing is good, the building of suspense is steady, the novel is relatively short compared to some of the recent bloated works of some authors, and most important, Koontz manages to create a very original story with an ending that I suspected, but the details I did not.  I suspect that \\"Odd Thomas\\" is going to show up as a movie.  I hope it is done well, because this well-written novel deserves to be filmed well.n on earth.<br />Dean Koontz wrote this story perfectly, continuing to build momentum from the discovery of Odd's talent, to meeting Fungus Man, to several dramatic and important events through the culmination of the story, when he pulls it all together.

My apprehension was unfounded with this intriguing thriller that combines the threads of human lives with the investigation of a mysterious phenomenon.<br />We meet teenage Ned Wilcox at the very beginning of the story.  His father was the late Curtis Wilcox, a state highway trooper with Troop D of the Pennsylvania State Patrol.  Ned helps around the barracks, cleaning, sweeping, and talking with the troopers.  We immediately identify with Ned, seeing his activities at the barracks as one way of connecting with his lost father, killed in the line of duty.  Ned becomes so much a part of the troop that the troop lets him in on a secret they have kept for 20 years; a mysterious, chilling secret.<br />One day, a long time ago, a man in an overcoat stopped at a gas station and asked the attendant to fill the car with gas.  The man disappeared around the corner of the gas station to the back where the restrooms are.  A long time after filling the car up the attendant realized the man had not come back from the back of the gas station, and went looking for him.  The man was no where to be found, and the attendant called the highway patrol.<br />One of the two troopers responding to the call was rookie Curtis Wilcox.  Their investigation of the car was anything but routine.  The car's engine had many of the correct components, but they were not connected to each other.  The configuration of the engine was such that there was no way the car could ever have run.  The state highway patrol decides to impound the car.  During the initial investigation of the car, Curtis's partner disappears, further compounding the mystery of the car.<br />Curtis Wilcox becomes obsessed with investigating the mysterious car.  Soon strange things begin happening; mysterious brilliant flashing lights that accompany electronic disturbances; things come from the trunk; things left in the car disappear from their cage.  There is something very wrong with this car.<br />Stephen King has written many horror novels where the villain is a werewolf, a vampire, a spirit, or even Satan.  In this novel we never meet the real villain, and we try to understand the nature of that villain from the artifact that the villain created.  The car itself is not evil, but what it does is evil, and perhaps where it comes from we might perceive as evil.  The troopers treat the car scientifically, investigating the car as methodically as they can.  They form theories and test their theories.  They record their observations as would any scientist.  They are also careful and cautious with their discovery, because they have found that bad things can happen to the unwary.<br />The story of the investigation of the car is told from multiple viewpoints, and in the past and the present; an extended story told to Ned Wilcox about the passion his father had for investigating the car, a passion that Ned was unaware of even as he neared adulthood.  The story telling can be a bit confusing if you lose focus on the story, but keeping track of the multiple main characters and their perspective is rewarding to the reader.<br />I liken the story-telling style of this novel to \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" by Arthur C. Clarke.  In that novel Clarke tells the story of humans investigating an alien ship that has entered our solar system.  There is speculation as to why the ship is there, where it is going, and the nature of the ship's creators.  The story is told in a scientific way that in many respects is boring because there is no \\"Alien\\" hiding around the corner, but is still intriguing because these investigators are in a totally unique situation, and they deal with it as best they can.  King's approach to this story is similar as he centers the story on a place that most of us would consider an unlikely location for a suspense, thriller or horror novel, a highway patrol barracks.  Yet, we find the scientific approach of these officers to be plausible.<br />The story has its slow moments, but I remained intrigued once King intimated the nature of the car.  By the last 50 pages I found myself glued to the book to see what was going to happen.  This book will not please Stephen King fans expecting a ghost story or something with fangs.  For fans with eclectic tastes that run into science fiction, particularly if you enjoyed Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Rama\\" books, this novel is a good read.  Fans expecting a scaly claw grabbing a victim by the throat and pulling the victim into the car will be disappointed.c approach of these officers to be plausible.<br />The story has its slow moments, but I remained intrigued once King intimated the nature of the car.

The introduction at the beginning of the story is the kind of introduction you might find today in a book about legends and their sources.  While the introduction slows down the reader's entry into the book, the reader later uses the introduction to help tie the eight short stories in the book together into a more coherent framework.  What the introduction infers is that the storyteller is an intelligent canine, and the eight stories are the remaining fragments of stories regarding the perhaps mythic creatures called Man.  The canine writing the story notes that there are conflicting viewpoints as to whether Man in fact ever existed, or was used to explain the origins of the intelligence of dogs.  The perspective of the narrator in the initial introduction and in the introduction of each of the stories is quite interesting and gives the reader a unique perspective.<br /><br />The stories themselves are interesting, but venture beyond science fiction in a variety of ways.  An explanation for ghosts is provided briefly.  There are so many elements introduced that are so far beyond our current knowledge that the story is closer to fantasy.  The stories cover genetically engineering dogs to have intelligence comparable to Man's.  We see a society that is so wealthy that cities are no longer required and everyone lives on a country estate.  Energy is abundant and incredibly cheap.  Man has the ability to transform himself into other creatures.  A class of man has mutated into incredibly intelligent and powerful beings that build doors to other worlds, and then they left the rest of mankind behind.<br /><br />Incredibly intelligent robots also appear throughout these stories.  I kept wondering why a robot would serve man for millennia when it had intelligence that appeared to surpass man's.  However, I had to suspend logic just a bit, though I also assumed that perhaps the robots had laws similar to those that Isaac Asimov later created for robots.  A sort of toss in side story that appears in a couple of places is about apparently advanced ants.  The one flaw with that side story is that ants have existed for millennia in the tropics and have not had to hibernate, and they had all the advantages of the ants in the story.  Once again Simak has included another fantastic story element.<br /><br />These stories were written in the 40s during a time of transition and development of modern science fiction.  Science fantasy had yet to be defined, and many early works of science fiction were so bizarre that were they to be published today they might well be considered fantasy versus the previously all-encompassing science fiction category.  However, even with the fantastic elements of the stories, the book is a good read.  The perspective of the dogs in the later stories is plausible and interesting.  I was most intrigued by the conclusion of the collection.  I had anticipated several endings, and yet, the actual ending was disturbing and somewhat sobering.  Clifford D. Simak tried his very best not to be egocentric with respect to his species.<br /><br />I think that during the time these stories were written this collection was likely one of the more innovative and interesting works.  Today the stories are a bit dated because we have accumulated another 60 years of knowledge.  We have learned that hibernation is more difficult that we thought it would be at that time.  We have learned that Jupiter does not have a solid surface, and the temperature on the planet is quite hot.  It does not appear that cities are likely to be abandoned any time in the near (and from what we can tell, even the far) future.  If you can ignore that knowledge, the stories turn out to be quite a bit of fun.though I also assumed that perhaps the robots had laws similar to those that Isaac Asimov later created for robots.

US	44759540	R4QYUHVMLSRX0	0894370146	435062215	The Illustrated Roger Zelazny	Books	3	14	14	N	N	Fair Graphic Rendition of a Classic Author	Roger Zelazny was one of the earliest of the so-called new wave science fiction writers.  He helped tell science fiction differently from the early masters of science fiction, including bringing aspects of fantasy into his science fiction.  Perhaps his most famous books were the ten books dealing with Amber.<br />In 1978, well before comics became more tuned to an adult audience, Roger Zelazny worked with artist Gray Morrow and editor Byron Preiss to create a graphic collection of short stories.  Four short stories are represented in this collection, one of which was written especially for the collection.  In addition is a very brief story, \\"Rock Collector,\\" two groups of art, and commentary by Zelazny.<br />The new short story is titled \\"Shadowjack.\\"  This story is the best reason for owning this collection as it is the only new story in it.  While I enjoyed reading and having the art from \\"The Doors of His Face, the Lamps of His Mouth,\\" the value of the rest of the collection was just okay.  The art quality is fair, but not breakthrough and not of the quality of today's graphic novels.<br />The two groups of art are titled \\"The Amber Worlds\\" and \\"A Zelazny Tapestry,\\" which has images of \\"Doorways in the Sand\\" and \\"Damnation Alley.\\"  I was less than impressed with the quality and style of the art.  I felt my mental imagery of Amber and the novels depicted by \\"A Zelazny Tapestry\\" was sharper and more mature than the art of Gray Morrow.  I'm sure that Gray Morrow is an excellent artist, but he was aiming for a young audience and not the sophisticated audience of 25+ years after he created this collection.<br />I did enjoy the art and story of the two page graphic story \\"Rock Collector;\\" an interesting story with a fun ending that could have done with a bit more development.<br />Another good aspect of this collection is the introductions provided by Zelazny.  Authors rarely take the opportunity to write about their writing, and the few things that we from Zelazny are valuable as Zelazny passed away in 1995.  I think he was frank with us, his readers, as he explained that this collection was an experiment to see how well illustration could complement his prose.  Apparently the experiment must not have gone well because I believe this was Zelazny's only attempt at a graphic book.  I do not count \\"Roger Zelazny's Visual Guide to Castle Amber\\" since that book illustrated locations and did not attempt to tell a story.<br />I am glad I have this book because I am a huge Zelazny fan, and I particularly enjoyed Zelazny's comments, and a couple of the stories I thought were enhanced by the illustrations.  However, I can recommend this book only to avid Zelazny fans that are looking to augment their collection.  Certainly long-time fans, along with the previously mentioned \\"The Doors of His Face, The Lamps of His Mouth\\", will already know \\"A Rose for Ecclesiastes\\" and \\"The Furies.\\"  Thus, only the graphics, the new short story and the Zelazny commentary will be of much interest to long-term fans.  If you are new to Zelazny, and enjoy science fiction and fantasy with a bit of a skewed approach, then you should get this collection.  Just keep your expectations for the graphics low.valuable as Zelazny passed away in 1995.

I was surprised and pleased that the comics got much better with time.<br />A good portion of this set of 19 comics revolves around the Tagge family, who generally opposes Darth Vader, but also opposes the rebellion.  Baron Tagge even hopes to supplant Darth Vader himself, though we know where such schemes end.  In \\"Doom Mission,\\" we find Baron Tagge has created a space station within the stormy atmosphere of the gas giant Yavin where Tie fighters launch attacks against the rebel base on the fourth moon.  This story is quite creative with how Baron Tagge created the space station, how it was discovered and how it was eventually attacked.<br />There are quite a few creative moments in the various stories.  In a series of three stories, \\"The Jawa Express,\\" \\"Saber Clash,\\" and \\"Thunder in the Stars,\\" we see the Tagge family test and implement an interesting device that freezes anything between implanted towers.  The Tagge family uses this device as a weapon against rebel forces.<br />In one of the most creative stories, \\"Riders in the Void,\\" we find Luke and Leia have jumped into the void between galaxies.  In one of the emptiest places in the universe Luke and Leia discover a unique, organic space ship with only one inhabitant, who is marginally insane.  The ship and its inhabitant have an interesting and unique history, and there are moments when I wondered how Luke and Leia were going to escape.<br />Creature creation was similarly unique and better than in the first 20 comics of \\"Doomworld.\\"  In \\"The Long Hunt/A Duel of Eagles\\" we meet the winged people of Skye.  In \\"Cavern of the Crawling Death\\" we learn about stone mites that destroy everything they contact as they eat it.<br />There are a few departures from the Star Wars universe as we know it today that are forgivable given that the second two Star Wars movies had yet to be released.  We see a Jabba the Hut very different from the slug-like creature we came to know and loathe.  We also see the continuing romance between Luke and Leia, though we also know that they are brother and sister.  Yet, the general tone of the stories fits well within the Star Wars universe, and the astute reader can see some of the substantial creativity yet to come.<br />If you read \\"Doomworld\\" and liked it, you'll find that \\"Dark Encounters\\" is substantially better and more interesting.  The quality of the stories is still lower than the general caliber of the Dark Horse stories, but some of them are very creative and interesting.  For those readers that look back fondly on memories of comics from the 60s and 70s, these are the types of stories that you remember well.  Enjoy!.

US	44759540	R36K3IZHULZWFK	0064410137	639861521	The Slippery Slope (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 10)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	You Can Lose Momentum on the Slippery Slope	For the tenth time we follow the adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, Violet, Klaus, and baby Sunny, though baby Sunny has grown up quite a bit since the first book.  While I have looked forward to this book, there were certain aspects of the book that I found disappointing compared to my expectations.<br />As you will recall from the last book, Count Olaf and his henchmen have kidnapped Sunny.  Violet and Klaus are presumed dead in the crash of a caravan.  Things are looking grim once again for the trio.  However, all is not lost for the Baudelaires as we know from our experiences with the first nine books.<br />In this book the orphans reach the Mortmain Mountains, the home of the long-sought headquarters, though not simultaneously or together.  The questions for this book are:  Will the orphans rejoin each other as they search for clues to their mysterious past?  Will the orphans reach headquarters at last, and if so, what will they find there?  What is the meaning of the mysterious initials \\"VFD?\\"  The Baudelaires are clearly in a Very Fine Dilemma in this book.  Watch out for the obnoxious snow gnats and beware of Snow Scouts wearing masks.<br />While I enjoyed this book, I had a vague feeling that perhaps Lemony Snicket was losing a bit of momentum in his writing.  The story seemed to move forward more slowly than the previous books.  Violet's inventions were fewer and less inspired.  Baby Sunny attempting to stop a toboggan with her teeth made me queasier than the previous uses of her teeth.  The revelations in this book just didn't seem quite as creative to me as the previous books.  It's possible that reading ten books with a similar style of writing has caused me to become accustomed to the style and it's no longer as fascinating as it once was.  However, the story was interesting and I look forward to the final two books in the series.  It will be interesting to see whether there is a Baudelaire parent that has survived the fire of the first book.  Will Count Olaf finally get what is coming to him?  Just what is in the mysterious Snicket file?  The questions are endless, and will keep me reading to the end of the series.Count Olaf finally get what is coming to him?

The very first strip in the book sets the tone.  In the middle of the night Calvin wakes up and says he's thirsty.  Calvin then goes for a drink of water.  Hobbes jumps off the bed and pounces on Calvin as he makes his way back to bed.  He parents find him in the hall with Hobbes on top of him, mumbling \\"homicidal psycho jungle cat.\\"<br />While the opening strip is humorous, there are even better strips.  Another favorite is one of Calvin's infamous \\"show and tell\\" strips.  Calvin says he has nothing for show and tell, but he tells everyone that during the daytime his mom puts on a patriotic leotard, a cape and knee-high, high-heeled boots to fight crime.  The teacher sends a note home with Calvin that his parent's look over together.  His father's comment?  \\"Wow, show me that outfit sometime.\\"<br />The breadth of strips is consistent with other Calvin and Hobbes books, but for some reason these strips gave me more laughs than many of my other Calvin and Hobbes Books.  However, the funniest strips often seem to be the cruelest.  For example, Suzy follows a series of signs regarding an \\"important message,\\" ending in a sign that says, \\"Important message:  Look Out!\\"  We then see Calvin sitting on a branch dropping a snowball, saying, \\"It's like shooting fish in a barrel.\\"<br />I enjoy Calvin and Hobbes a lot.  Of all the illustrated books I have, Calvin and Hobbes are among the funniest, and the most consistent.  This particular collection is particularly funny, though a bit more bizarre than many of the other collections.  However, it is the twisted nature of some of the strips that make them so interesting and funny.  If you are a Calvin and Hobbes fan or just looking for a smile, here is an excellent book.	2004-01-09

If all the other Calvin and Hobbes books I have are excellent, then surely this one must be great.  All the comics in this wonderful collection are in color, and are rendered incredibly well.  If you thought the original Sunday comics were good, then you'll love the rich color of these.<br />This book opens with a 10 page mini-story about Spaceman Spiff, Interplanetary Explorer Extraordinaire.  The art in this story is very good.  I think that Bill Watterson was born in the wrong era.  He would have been much happier in the era when Sunday comics were permitted a full page to tell a refined story, where the art was rich with detail.<br />Once into the book you get a collection of comics that originally appeared in Sunday newspapers.  While the humor level varies, most will make you smile, and some will give you laughs.  It would be impossible to describe the variety stories, but a couple of examples will help.<br />In one story Calvin has glued paper feathers to his arm in order to fly.  Consistent with Bill Watterson's father's profession (he's a patent attorney), Calvin tells Hobbes that he will get the patent when his device works.  Hobbes gives Calvin a heave over a cliff with predictable results.  Hobbes advises Calvin, \\"Don't sell the bike shop, Orville.\\"<br />For a Mother's Day related strip, Calvin has created a Mother's Day card, including a poem he wrote himself.  Included in the poem are comments regarding the size of his allowance, and the poem ends with a request to get out of bed and cook breakfast.  His mothers comment?  \\"I'm deeply moved.\\"<br />This collection is filled with a variety of Calvin and Hobbes staples.  Calvin the dinosaur makes several appearances, there are a variety of snowman comics, there are a number of with Susie Derkins, and Calvin's usually bizarre viewpoint of life.  Given the quality of the book, the longer length of the strips, and the full color, I consider this book to be a very good value, particularly when you consider other graphic books of similar size.  Bill Watterson has been a consistently good writer and artist, and each of these full page, full color strips will be a treat for fans of the series and anyone else in need of a smile.er graphic books of similar size.

The first eighteen or nineteen pages contain more prose and philosophy than it does art, and I've always bought \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" books for the humor.  I really felt as though the philosophy and description that Bill Watterson was describing was a distraction, at first.  But the more I read, the more I started to get into \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" from Watterson's perspective.  Looking at the evolution of \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" as described by Watterson, and his travails with syndicators, I have a new perspective on what it takes to create a strip like \\"Calvin and Hobbes.\\"<br /><br />The art and the strips are outstanding, as with the other \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" collections, but this time we also get to see Watterson's perspectives on various characters.  Some of Watterson's observations about various characters are as funny as the strips themselves.  Watterson makes a rather succinct comment regarding Moe the bully.  I'll leave you to read the comment, but it's hilarious.<br /><br />Watterson offers comments on all the major characters along with key details about each.  Moe, of course, being a simple moron bully, requires minimal description, but the other key characters have a history associated with them.  Watterson provided a bit of a compliment to his wife in his description of Susie Derkins.  I also agree with Watterson that I suspect that Calvin does have a mild crush on Susie.  Watterson offers nearly a half a page of comments on both Calvin and Hobbes that are interesting reading.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the selection of various strips over ten years of the strip, showing the evolution of the strip and the characters.  It's interesting to see how the quality of the strip has improved in ten years as Watterson continually perfected the characters.  Being a cartoonist is clearly much more difficult than I ever thought it was.<br /><br />I will miss \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" since Watterson has retired the strip.  However, all the collections are still available, and I think they will continue to be fresh in the decades to come.  The insight Watterson has provided in this book is valuable for hard core fans interested in Watterson's viewpoint on his creations.  If you are uninterested in Watterson's perspective, you can always skip over it and read the strips!

Bill Watterson has an excellent way of looking at us from a slightly twisted child's point of view, but a child who has to be a genius or near-genius.<br />This collection contains some of the best winter strips that Watterson ever created.  The images of a snow man worshipping Calvin are funny, especially in the last portion of the strip.  In another strip Calvin has created a group of small snow men, and has taken another one to the roof as a potential suicide.  While this strip sounds very twisted, it's also humorous.  Another winter strip sums up the parents feelings as they note that Calvin's activities have led to the neighbors planting really big trees along the boundaries of their property.<br />Hobbes is an integral part of Calvin's life, ranging from insulting to supporting to the poignant.  One of the best poignant strips is when Hobbes takes Calvin out to the school bus while it's raining, carrying an umbrella for him.  Soon Calvin's parents look out the window to see Hobbes as a stuff animal with an umbrella tucked under one arm.  Calvin's father goes out to retrieve Hobbes and then we see another image of Calvin sitting in school staring at the clock, clearly worrying about Hobbes in the rain.<br />There are quite a few collections of \\"Calvin and Hobbes.\\"  Of the eight or nine collections that I have I have found every one to be a worthy addition to my library and hope to eventually have them all.  Of the \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" collections I have this one is one of the best.	2004-01-02

On the one hand, this is what we once had.  On the other hand, some of it was really corny.  Sometimes the art was pretty awful.  Other times it was the story line.  Yet, through it all it was a lot like a grade B movie in comic book form; fun to read though you could never take it too seriously.<br />Some of the ideas were pure corn.  How about a giant carnivorous rabbit (Jaxxon).  The Don Wan Kioti character was right out of \\"The Man of La Mancha.\\" There are other examples, but these suffice to give you a rough idea.<br />In spite of all the corn, these things are fun to read.  The stories take me back to the days of yore when comics really were oriented towards young boys rather than adults, and we ate these things up.  Of course, these were what we had, and we had no comparison to the quality graphics in todays comics.  Many people in the industry are loath to call them comics.<br />While the book is a bit pricey, on the other hand you do get 20 comics.  The book is pretty thick and the reproductions are good.  You have to be a hard-core Star Wars fan or nostalgic for original Star Wars comics to want these, but for either of those groups, enjoy!	2003-12-26

The stories were based, as the title implies, on classic novels.  Perhaps my favorite was &quot;Master of the World,&quot; based on the novel of the same name by Jules Verne.  The science fiction theme and the characters created this wonderful world that appeared as though it could be real, rather than the complete fantasy of Superman or Marvel's venerable lineup of mutants and superheroes.<br />&quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" is reminiscent of those great Classics Illustrated comics, but with a much more adult edge.  Early in the book we find Alan Quatermain addicted to opium and apparently well down the road to an oblivious death.  We soon find Hawley Griffin, \\"The Invisible Man,\\" creating multiple pregnancies attributed to either demons or saints.  Clearly this story is far different from the comics I read as a youth.  But what a story it is.  While told with a distinctly adult edge, the story is an epic tale of some of the best literary characters of the Victorian era fighting against a villain intent on (what else?) conquering the world.<br />In the course of the travails of the dubiously phrased good guys a number of deaths occur, and the significantly less than pure predilections of our heroes form a dark base to a story that is nominally of good versus evil, but turns out to be more of evil versus not-as-evil.<br />The real marvel of the story is the style in which it was written.  I have read many of the classics that form a basis for this graphic novel, and the style herein emulates that style in a disconcertingly exceptional way.  There were points where I wondered how Alan Moore was able to capture the style of 100 years ago in a newly created novel.  If there were gross inconsistencies with that style, I was unable to find them.  Those unfamiliar with classic literature may find the style a bit difficult to read, but once you get into it you find that it challenges your mental abilities and makes you think about events and writing in a different way.<br />There have been few graphic novels for which I would provide more than a mild recommendation to another reader.  In the case of this novel, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys graphic novels and classic literature, particularly adventure classics.  If you enjoyed \\"Classics Illustrated\\" series of books that date quite far into the past, you will find some similarities.  However, be warned that this is clearly an adult story.

US	44759540	RTJNISHHJQW8D	0843945508	217573810	Bite	Books	3	5	5	N	N	It Bites	It's been a while since I've read a \\"vampire\\" story.  I've read several of Anne Rice's excellent books, and of course everything Stephen King has written set in Salem's Lot.  Given the excellence of the aforementioned books any author trying to write a vampire story has much to measure up to.  Unfortunately this tongue-in-cheek effort by Richard Laymon makes little effort to be excellent, and is instead a weird combination of coincidences with a fair amount of sex and more than a little perversion.  I was intrigued by the story line, and kept thinking the author was going to really turn this story into something, but instead the bulk of the story is a running chase between a psycho by the ironic name of Snow White and the two principal characters, Sam and Cat (Catherine).<br /><br />There is a knock on Sam's door one night, and there is the girl he has loved his whole life standing in the door in a robe asking for him to come with her.  Sam quickly finds he has landed in his own version of \\"Blue Velvet,\\" standing in a closet waiting for a vampire with the fearsome name of Elliot to show up.  Elliot is staked reasonably quickly and our murderers now have to dispose of him.  I say him because he's a vampire, and as we all know, vampires may not be dead even when you think they are.  Sam and Cat make a mess of getting Elliot into Cat's car, spending a fair amount of time on the details of how messy they got and cleaning everything up.  In a way, all this action is still background for the story.<br /><br />Sam and Cat then take off into the desert to go find a place to get rid of Elliot.  Coincidence number one happens when they have a blowout, which may have been a gunshot, and run into a big guy by the name of Snow White.  White states that he was forced off the highway by a gunshot.  Through a series of not too smart actions, Snow White finds out that Sam and Cat have a vampire in the trunk of their car.  Snow White volunteers to help them get rid of the vampire.  As if this book wasn't already weird enough, it gets even weirder.<br /><br />Sam and Cat try to get away from White while in the area of Inyokern and Ridgecrest, California, and actually make it, zipping through Trona (which really does have quite an odor to it - I've been there) toward Death Valley.  White catches up with them by using a van driven by two teenagers that he kidnapped.  From this point forward the book is cat and mouse between the five characters until the end of the story, which I'll not reveal in any more detail, except to say that the violence and sex are taken up at least one or two notches from the earlier portion of the book.<br /><br />The primary problem with this book is that Laymon tried to put too much into the book.  There is as much sex in this book as there is violence, and more sex than vampirism.  There are way too many coincidences.  There are too many places where events are wrapped up too neatly.  While many parts of the book are bloody and sexual, and would seemingly call for a serious note, there is quite a bit of tongue-in-cheek.  Ultimately the juxtaposition of coincidences and overlapping story focus distracted me to the point that I could no longer consider the novel as a serious story.<br /><br />This novel is not a bad novel, but it's not all that good either.  For fans of vampire novels this book will be somewhat of a disappointment.  While there is some mystery to the story, the mystery is insufficiently complex to be more than a distraction.  Read this book only if you run out of the much better books available.asn't already weird enough, it gets even weirder.

Seawolf, is patrolling in shallow water in the Yellow Sea, trying to get information regarding a new communist Chinese nuclear ballistic missile submarine.  The biggest questions the crew of the Seawolf is trying to answer are the size of the missiles the new submarine will carry and how many it will carry, the goal being to understand the strategic offensive capability of the submarine.<br />The Seawolf's crew evades several attempts by the Chinese to sink her, providing several tense moments throughout the early part of the book.  However, due to an error in navigation, and more than a bit of arrogance, the Seawolf finds herself in relatively shallow water with little more than auxiliary motive power.  Soon the Chinese cleverly capture the Seawolf and her crew.<br />The United States can ill afford to have the Seawolf remain the property of the Chinese, knowing they will steal every piece of technology they possibly can.  Further, after detailed consideration of communist Chinese motives and past record, high-level decision makers determine that it is unlikely that the Chinese will release the crew of the Seawolf.  After pages of consideration, it's decided that the Seawolf must not remain in Chinese hands, and her crew must be freed.  It's at this point that the setup for the bulk of the book ends and the real action begins.  The remainder of the book details how the last two tasks are accomplished and how well they are accomplished, details which will remain for the reader to discover.<br />I enjoyed reading the book.  I thought portions of the book were filled with suspense and reasonably believable action.  However, I suspect that readers with significant knowledge of the military will likely find some plot holes and several discrepancies.  My knowledge of Navy related equipment and techniques is cursory, at best, so I'm sure I missed plot holes that would be obvious to more knowledgeable readers.  I did have several problems with the story.  Not all the problems I had can be detailed here as a discussion would give away portions of the story.  However, let me provide a couple of examples.  First, the executive officer makes a critical and fundamental error in operation of the periscope.  I know mistakes can happen, but improper operation of a periscope by the executive officer of a submarine would seem to me to be the equivalent of a pilot not knowing how to operate flaps properly.  In another situation a fighter is expected to drop a bomb undetected in a heavily defended area.  The explanation of how the fighter penetrated Chinese air space to drop the bomb without being detected, and further, getting away without being detected, was shaky.<br />I could point out several other details that were a bit of a stretch, but I should also point out that this book should be considered a military thriller, and as such some assumptions should be allowed to be made.  I think the author made more than he should have made, which is why I gave the book only four stars, but during the action portions I was interested in what was going to happen next.  I am also tempted to rate the book lower because of the somewhat banal ending, with which I disagreed.  However, it was the author's prerogative to end the book as he did, regardless of whether I thought the actions of at least one character were inconsistent with that character's personality.<br />Military fiction can be difficult to write.  The author spun an interesting tale that held me well enough to the end, with minimal distraction due to extraneous details.

The beginning was a little slow to take off, but I was hooked around page 50 or so, and could barely keep from flipping to the end to see how it all ended.  What impressed me most about this book was the outstanding ending, with more than one of those twists that many authors try to put into a book, but here they are all successful.<br />Channing Mannheim is the highest paid actor in the world.  Handsome to the point where he is called \\"The Face,\\" he lives a life style that none of us can imagine.  Surrounded constantly by bodyguards, servants, and various hangers-on, he is the epitome of the rich and famous.  While Channing is mentioned frequently throughout the book, we meet this world-famous man personally but once.  However, we lack not for principal characters.  The most important are Aelfric (who likes to be called Fric) Mannheim, Channing's 10-year-old and somewhat normal son, Ethan Truman, a former police officer, now head of Channing's security and married to the late Hannah Truman, Corky Laputa, anarchist extraordinaire, and Dunny Whistler, once (and perhaps always) Ethan's best friend, though turned to a life of crime before he died.<br />While these four characters are the focus of the multiple chapters, Koontz does his very best to complicate the story by introducing a host of secondary characters.  The characters are described in sufficient depth to enhance your understanding of the personalities of the principal characters, and while the complexity of the story challenges the ability to keep track of who's who, in general I was able to stay on top of what was happening in the story.<br />With all these characters running about, there must be an interesting story here, and there is.  To describe the happenings in detail would give away too much, so I offer a flavor.  The reader quickly finds out that Corky has a good acquaintance by the name of Rolf Reynard.  Rolf is supposed to be leaving mysterious packages at the estate of Channing Mannheim, but he makes a big mistake and Mannheim's security spots him on camera.  Let the weirdness begin.<br />We are quickly lured into a world inhabited by some of the strangest, and often some of the most chilling, people and events of any Koontz book.  A man walks from a mirror.  Anarchists plot to sow disorder on the world by killing and trying to cause racial unrest and unrest in general.  Any opportunity to increase anger by one neighbor toward another is taken.  We also discover that these anarchists have an evil in them that may be more responsible for their enjoyment of chaos than a dislike for order.  Dead men may walk.  A central character is killed, or is he?  We come face to face with unspeakable evil.  We meet ultimate good.  Koontz has managed to cram a lot into 600 pages of reading pleasure.<br />Koontz has a history of unsatisfying endings.  This book is proof that when Koontz comes up with a good ending, it can be a great ending.  While I had predicted portions of the ending, much of it, including most of the key aspects, was a total surprise.  Portions of the last part of the book were worthy of James Bond.  I suspect that this book would make an excellent movie.  I plan to go see it, as it inevitably will become a movie.<br />Koontz has written all types of books, including science fiction, fantasy, horror, mystery, thrillers, and just plain weird books.  This book is a supernatural horror story, and a very good one.  While the action is steady and paced versus a roller coaster ride, it is like the long, long climb to the top of a single steep hill.  While the wait can seem endless, the drop at the end is worth it.  Fans of Koontz will find this to be one of Koontz' best.  Fans of horror novels will enjoy the novel ending.

As with the other books in this series, it is very funny, insightful of people and children, and something that I seem to be able to read over and over.  Bill Waterson brings a perspective on humans that is as unique as Gary Larson's perspectives, only his viewpoint surrounds our &quot;hero,&quot; Calvin.  The long-suffering Hobbes (a tiger, don't you know) is often a voice of doubt and sanity that Calvin rarely, if ever, heeds.  When Calvin realizes that Hobbes is being critical, a fight generally ensues.  Given that Hobbes is a &quot;ferocious&quot; tiger, Calvin rarely gains the upper hand.<br />This book is excellent and relatively benign humor, good for any occasion when you need a break from the world.  More amazing, this book can be read over and over, and each time you'll still find it funny.  I strongly recommend this book.	2003-08-31

Dylan O'Conner and his brother Shepherd are attacked in a motel by an apparent madman by the name of Proctor.  However, the attack is an injection of `something' that takes us much of the length of the book to discover.  Proctor warns Dylan to leave the motel as quickly as possible because there are those who would see Dylan and Shep dead if these others were aware of the injection.  Dylan and his brother leave the motel as soon as Dylan is able to escape from being tied in a chair by Proctor.<br />While hastily departing Dylan meets Jillian Jackson, a struggling standup comedian.  Dylan quickly discovers that Jillian has also been injected, and urges her to accompany Dylan and his brother.  Let the action begin.  The ever-popular men in black SUVs dressed for golf (truly, khaki shorts and golf shirts) show up, and suddenly the motel does not look like a good place to stay; particularly as Jilly's beautiful Cadillac, stolen by Proctor, is blown up shortly thereafter.<br />As Dylan, Shep and Jillian are making their getaway, Dylan touches a frog he was given at an eatery adjacent to the motel, and suddenly feels a compelling urge to go find the person who gave him the frog.  The events that occur at this woman's house make you realize that whatever was in the injection was some powerfully weird stuff.<br />Koontz' recent predilection for Dickensian plot complexity still shows up in this book, but to a lesser degree than in some of his recent books.  Koontz' does a better job in this book of developing believable characters.  Jillian would have been easy to portray as an angry comedian, but instead she is a sweet person that tries to make a joke of everything.  Her character is allowed the opportunity to provide details of her history, allowing the complexities of her character traits to be explained.  Similarly with Dylan; he is an artist, but rather than being the long-haired brooding stereotypical artist, we find that he has been watching over his autistic brother Shep for many years, and while the reader at first thinks that Koontz is going to forego any development of Dylan's character by using Shep to cover for his lack of personality, we find that Dylan has enough angst to keep at least two psychotherapists busy for decades.<br />Several other reviewers have revealed too many details about the injection and provide too many plot spoilers.  Just in case you decide not to read other reviews, I'll not spoil the surprises for you.  Suffice it to say that Dylan, Jillian and Shep have at least two other exciting and significant adventures before we reach the end of the book.<br />My biggest complaint about books by Dean Koontz has always been his endings, and this book is no exception.  I think the ending was a bit weak.  There was plenty of opportunity for the principal characters to have various revelations, to do more, to do something.  On the other hand, the ending is a natural lead-in to a sequel, and I'm hoping that Dean plans a sequel for this book; it's just begging for one.<br />As far as recent Dean Koontz books, I think \\"False Memory\\" was more intense; I think \\"One Door Away from Heaven\\" was weaker than this book.  Certainly worthy of reading if you are a Koontz fan, but not his best.  Coupled with a sequel, this book could later garner a five star rating.rather than being the long-haired brooding stereotypical artist, we find that he has been watching over his autistic brother Shep for many years, and while the reader at first thinks that Koontz is going to forego any development of Dylan's character by using Shep to cover for his lack of personality, we find that Dylan has enough angst to keep at least two psychotherapists busy for decades.<br />Several other reviewers have revealed too many details about the injection and provide too many plot spoilers.

On the other hand, the ending is a natural lead-in to a sequel, and I'm hoping that Dean plans a sequel for this book; it's just begging for one.<br />As far as recent Dean Koontz books, I think \\"False Memory\\" was more intense; I think \\"One Door Away from Heaven\\" was weaker than this book.  Certainly worthy of reading if you are a Koontz fan, but not his best.  Coupled with a sequel, this book could later garner a five star rating.	2003-05-09

The Baudelaire orphans left \\"The Hostile Hospital\\" in the trunk of Count Olaf's car; clearly a potentially very dangerous situation for Violet, Klaus and baby Sunny.  However, once again the children use their wits to figure out how to escape their predicament.<br />The children find themselves in a run down carnival with another bizarre cast of characters, including several supposed \\"freaks.\\"  However, the freaks are not really all that freakish, one being a contortionist and one being ambidextrous.  The children disguise themselves as freaks and manage to fool Count Olaf and his gang for most of the book.  However, as we all know, eventually Count Olaf finds the children and another harrowing ending ensues.<br />Over the last two or three books we've been given tidbits about bigger mysteries surrounding the children and their parents.  In this book the tidbits become much more substantial, and give us a clue as to the direction the series might take.  While it may seem that my description is a bit vague, that is because I do not wish to give away any of the surprises in this book, and there is at least one very big surprise for the children and the reader, as well as a number of smaller surprises.<br />Because of the twists and turns, I am unable to provide the description I normally do for books in this series.  As I noted earlier, there are a lot of surprises.  Those surprises make for one of the most intriguing books in this series.  I am anxiously anticipating the next volume, and even more, the end of the series, when I am hoping all the mysteries are finally revealed.<br />This particular entry in the series does involve death, again, and in your imagination the death is likely somewhat gruesome.  Fortunately the amount of description given to the death is minimal, and is left mostly to the reader's imagination.  Because of several intense moments, and the death, I would recommend this book for children 9 and older, though as always you should know the ability of your child to handle books similar to this one.  This book does have its educational moments, though somewhat muted in comparison to some of the other entries in this series.  Overall, the continued challenge to the paradigm that children's books for the stated age range should be relatively tame along with the creativity of this particular book requires a rating of 5 stars.

The children are walking away from the village of V.F.D., trying to figure out what to do now that they are on the run from the law.<br />The children come to a general store in the middle of nowhere, which fortunately contains a telegraph.  They try to contact Mr. Poe to tell him they did not commit the crime of which they are accused.  Unfortunately, the children do not hear back from Mr. Poe before the person that delivers the newspaper arrives and shows the store owner a picture of the children in the newspaper.  After a chase throughout the store the children escape from the store into a van containing the most bizarre collection of hospital volunteers that you have ever seen.<br />The children realize they need to do some research to see if they can find more information about their family, and a man who was murdered in the village of V.F.D.  By a strange coincidence, the hospital has a huge records department in the basement containing hundreds of file cabinets of information from all over the county.  By another strange coincidence the children are able to volunteer to work in this facility.<br />As you can imagine, the children have to live somewhere, and they would rather not have to drive back in forth in the van lest someone recognize them.  Further, where would they go anyway?  So the children live in the unfinished half of Heimlich Hospital, using a canvas cover for a blanket and to keep warm.<br />The children's search through the records is disturbed by the arrival of, yes, you guessed it, Count Olaf.  This time we see very little of Count Olaf, and instead see another character the reader will know from a previous story (I'm not telling!).  During a chase through the records room one of the Baudelaire orphans is captured, and Count Olaf and his gang of criminals plan to do an operation on the captured orphan that is planned to turn fatal.<br />As we reach the end of the story the Baudelaire orphans escape Count Olaf once again, as much as they ever escape.  However, this time their escape is more precarious than any previous escape, and we are left to wait for \\"The Carnivorous Carnival\\" to see how it all turns out.<br />There is another strong educational message in this book, presented with only a little subtlety.  In order to learn more about their parents the Baudelaire family the children must try to find the information in the records room.  Their search is detailed as they fruitlessly search through file after file.  As always there are the words that are explained by the author.<br />This book has managed to top the previous books in this series.  The excitement is much greater and the story is faster paced.  While the ending of the story can be truly frightening for younger audiences, the children do escape.  I recommend this book for at least a 9-year-old child, however, as always, you need to judge the ability of your child to read these books.  I am in the process of reading \\"The Carnivorous Carnival\\", and can hardly wait to see how this series of books will end.  Five stars for another excellent entry in this series.t Olaf and his gang of criminals plan to do an operation on the captured orphan that is planned to turn fatal.<br />As we reach the end of the story the Baudelaire orphans escape Count Olaf once again, as much as they ever escape.

On the theory that it takes a village to raise a child, Mr. Poe, the children's supposed guardian, takes the children to V.F.D., a village populated by crows and really weird people in the middle of nowhere.<br />The children's fortunes have not improved from their last home.  This time the children are forced to do chores for the town, all day long.  Further, many of the people for whom they do chores little appreciate what the children do.  Lastly, the children and everyone in town must follow an extensive list of incredibly ridiculous rules.<br />Soon after the children arrive in town they find a note (a rhyming couplet) from their previously kidnapped friends, Duncan and Isadora Quagmire, kidnapped two books ago by Count Olaf.  As time proceeds, the children find more couplets written by Isadora Quagmire.  The children hope and believe the couplets will lead them to the location of the Quagmires so that they might be rescued.<br />As always happens to the Quagmires, Count Olaf shows up again, and as usual, he has assorted followers that are with him, including one surprise returning character (I'm not telling!).  This time Count Olaf shows up as a detective to solve a murder that occurs in the village.  The victim will be an amazing surprise to every reader (and I'm not telling you that one either!).<br />Of course the story climaxes in a way that might lead the reader to believe that the Baudelaire's will escape.  Well, the children do get away from town, but when they do they are being hunted for a crime they didn't commit.  The ending of this story neatly fits into the beginning of the next book, \\"The Hostile Hospital\\", where the children continue to be on the run from the law.<br />It seems like each book in this series is better than the last.  While the violence in these books is a lot more than traditional books for this age range, these books clearly distinguish right from wrong and good from bad.  Additionally, there are strong educational messages as the children typically have to rely on their own resources and abilities to escape from Count Olaf, typically using their reading skills and innovative abilities to improvise and overcome.  Sometimes the educational messages are very strong, such as when the author explicitly defines the meanings of words within the stories.<br />I thought this story was intriguing in a variety of ways, and the author manages to introduce a touch of science fiction or fantasy in the story in the method the children try to use to escape.  Lemony Snicket manages to improve his creativity with every story.  Because of the mild violence, I would recommend this book for 9 year-olds and above, but, as always, you should know your child and his or her ability to handle the material in this book.

They can and they did.  In \\"The Ersatz Elevator\\", the sixth book in this series, the Baudelaire orphans move in with a non-relative in a penthouse apartment.  While you might think that a penthouse apartment (which has something like 71 bedrooms) and kitchens, and sitting rooms, and on and on, would be a lovely place to live, you would be thinking wrong, because this is one of the books in \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\", and those of you that have read the previous books know that little good comes to pass concerning the Baudelaire orphans.<br />This time the problem is that Esme Squalor (the sixth most important financial advisor in the city) and her husband Jerome are way too hung up on what is \\"in\\".  Esme must go to only the \\"in\\" restaurants; she must wear only \\"in\\" clothes, which includes the children, and on and on.  Unfortunately, being \\"in\\" also means multiple compromises in terms of comfort.  For example, the penthouse is on the top of a building with 66 stories, and elevators are \\"out\\".  So the Squalors and the Baudelaires must walk up and down the 66 stories each time the go in to and out from the building.  They certainly received sufficient exercise.  Before I forget, orphans are also \\"in\\".<br />Of course, we know that Count Olaf must eventually show up, and he does.  However, there is a mystery.  We find that Count Olaf went up to the apartment and did not later leave the building.  Therein lies the crux of the mystery for this story.<br />This story climaxes with the children running briefly into old friends, and then losing them again.  They also nearly catch Count Olaf, again.  In the end, the children are forced to find a new home once again.  Unfortunately I am unable to tell you more, because Lemony Snicket, should he ever escape from his current predicament, would hunt me down and provide me with agony should I reveal the end of this Baudelaire tale.  Suffice it to say that the Baudelaires have their best adventure yet, with even better to come.<br />This series has had its strong points and its weak points.  In general this book is one of the better ones in the series, readily matching \\"The Austere Academy\\".  In addition to the direct lessons provided in the book, the children once again are masters of their own fates, and are forced to get themselves out of their predicaments with minimal adult help.  I also enjoyed the moral tale provided by Lemony Snicket regarding people that must always keep up with everyone else in style or fashion.  For this last point alone the book is a must-read for every teenage child.<br />The violence in this story is a bit more muted than in some of the previous books, and I think that an 8 or 9 year old child should be able to handle the story well.  Certainly Esme could generate a great deal of family discussion of status and whether status is sufficiently important to cause people pain or to break laws.<br />In keeping with the trend of the last book, this book continues to expose the children to new experiences and to challenge their abilities to take care of themselves.  Once again, while there are certainly negative aspects to the story, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives.  This book is easily a good successor to \\"The Austere Academy\\", and sets a standard for the next books in the series.  I will tell you now that the next two books are just as good as or better than this book and \\"The Austere Academy\\", thus continuing the excellence of this unconventional children's series.  5 stars again!ffice it to say that the Baudelaires have their best adventure yet, with even better to come.<br />This series has had its strong points and its weak points.

US	44759540	RTNO0379809GC	0553582755	598224178	One Door Away from Heaven	Books	4	3	3	N	N	It's A Bumpy Journey	Dean Koontz has been on a roll for some time now.  He went through a period when I was becoming increasingly restive with his novels, but with the last several that has changed.  \\"False Memory\\", after having a slow beginning, took off and grabbed my attention to the end.  \\"One Doorway Away from Heaven\\" took off fast and pulled me along from beginning to end.<br />Koontz has become the master of incorporating Dickensian style into a thriller.  In this book we have no less than three separate stories plus sub-stories that are eventually meshed into one.  The story begins with Micky Bellsong, a woman who begins the story with no job, and very little past.  We quickly meet Leilani Klonk, an extremely intelligent and very pretty nine and a half year old child with physical deformities.  Leilani tells stories so outrageous that any adult would be unable to believe them.<br />Just as quickly we are introduced to a private detective, and find that he has a mentally handicapped brother.  The brother is not critical to the story, but is used with a couple of early incidents to enhance our understanding that the detective has a very well defined and strong morality.<br />Next we meet a boy running from a murderer or murderers unknown.  We know very little about the boy or why anyone would want to murder him, and how those persons are tracking him through deserts and mountains and a good portion of the west for a large portion of the book.<br />Dean performs a literary trick used effectively by Tom Clancy in his books.  Dean creates substantial activity around the boy to hold your interest while developing the characters of Leilani and Micky.  The details that are revealed to the reader by Leilani as the book progresses contributes to a sense of unease that also feels urgent because of the often dramatic action scenes involving the boy, Curtis Hammond, that intersperse the chapters about Leilani and Micky and the detective.<br />Ultimately all the stories are tied neatly together for a climax that should hold your attention, and a rather satisfying ending.<br />A few small provisos:<br />Bioethics is a central theme of this story, and Koontz makes it very clear that he is against bioethics, at least in its extreme form.<br />Koontz is a dog lover, and if you do not like dogs, particularly golden retrievers, then you may as well not bother to read this story, because golden retrievers are instrumental to the story.  Koontz gets to do this because he is the story teller, and he likes golden retrievers.<br />There are a few small semi-implausibilities.  Curtis is chased all over the west by assassins and the government, and then suddenly they stop chasing him.  While the book provides logic for the lack of pursuit, Koontz could have handled the ending differently.  True, the book would have been longer, but the pursuit stopped so suddenly that you feel like pursuit was swept under the rug.  Koontz' characterizations of certain government individuals seems a bit off to me.  In my state a low-level government official would love to go after a \\"famous\\" person if they thought they could; nothing like fame to make you a target.  There are perhaps other places where Dean was a bit weak, but in general I'm pointing out minor lapses versus serious problems.<br />If you live in a trailer park and you believe aliens may abduct you, or your wife, or sister, or whatever, or if you believe Elvis lives with aliens, then do not read this book because portions of the book heavily satirizes people who fall into these categories.<br />Probably the part of the book that will upset the most people is the ending.  I personally liked the ending up to a point, and then it got a bit cutesy.  Did the cutesy portion make the book bad?  No.  However, the cutesy portion felt a bit juvenile and a bit out of place.<br />I give the book four stars because I enjoyed it, and I always have soft touch for happy endings.  Furthermore, I appreciated the science fiction influences.  Some portions of the book perhaps could have been smoother, and certainly this book is not his best.  Because of the provisos listed above, I would need to be careful recommending the book without knowing someone's personal tastes and beliefs.  However, if you have an open mind, and you enjoy reading something different, you might give this one a read.  Good luck!nces.

Instead, we are at Prufrock Academy, a boarding school.  Secondly, the Baudelaire's acquire two friends at this new school.  There are additional positives.  They actually get to eat, they get to study, and they get to read.  For a moment you might actually think that things are looking up for the Baudelaires.  Ah, but for those familiar with the series, you know that can't be true.<br />If the Baudelaires violate any of a series of bizarre rules they must endure a series of equally bizarre punishments relating to their meals.  Included in this list of punishments is loss of silverware, loss of a cup, though you still get your drink, it's just in a puddle on your tray, and even having your hands tied behind your back at mealtime.<br />The Baudelaires also must endure six hours of bad violin music each night by the exquisitely horrible violinist, Vice Principal Nero.  If you have ever heard violin played badly, you might realize that you could almost rather hear fingernails scrapping across a blackboard, almost.  If you miss one of Nero's concerts you must pay him a bag of candy.  As you have now realized, this school is terrible, though admittedly things start out much better than they did in \\"The Miserable Mill\\".<br />As you have probably also guessed, Count Olaf does eventually show up.  However, Count Olaf does not immediately try to spirit the children away from Prufrock Academy.  Instead, he has them exercise nightly, all night long.  The children try to figure out his scheme all the way up to the point where he does execute his scheme, and I can say no more or you will miss all the fun.<br />In this book the children meet triplets who are now twins because one of the twins died.  The five children become good friends because they are all orphans.  Furthermore, they all get along well and work together to try and beat Count Olaf.  However, the children are generally at the mercy of Count Olaf almost from the point he shows up to nearly the end of the story.<br />While in the previous books the children largely escaped from Count Olaf due to their own abilities, this time the children are saved due to a combination of fortunate circumstances, including the help of their new friends.  We do not find out where the children are going next at the end of this book, but of course we know that they will have another home in \\"The Ersatz Elevator\\".<br />The educational messages in this book came roaring back after what I thought were relatively weaker messages in the last book.  This time the children get to learn a variety of new words, and they also learn that there is value in true friendship.  The children also display a good amount of trust in their new friends, which has been difficult for them to give in previous books.  One educational opportunity in this book is the chance for parents to deal with the subject of kidnapping.  In order to not spoil the story I'll not tell you any details, but a question parents could ask their children is whether the children or the school could have done something to prevent the kidnapping from occurring.<br />I've considered the previous books in this series to be more suitable for children approximately 9 and older.  This book is milder than the previous books, and I think an 8-year-old child should be able to handle it well.  As always, you should know your child and his or her ability to handle the subject matter within.<br />This book was quite a change from the previous books.

Once again the orphans have moved to another relative, this one the owner of the Lucky Smells Lumbermill in the rundown town of Paltryville.  I'm not sure of the relationship of this new person to the children, and we really see very little of this wicked, uncaring person in any case.  Furthermore, because he supposedly has a difficult name to pronounce, we never know his name, he is just called \\"Sir\\" or \\"The Boss\\".<br />The children toil in the lumber mill from the time they arrive in Paltryville.  Soon they have splinters and are tired and hungry, because they get nothing for breakfast, almost nothing for lunch, and casserole for dinner.  There are multiple labor  and child abuse laws violated in this book, but perhaps it might make some readers more appreciative of what they have given that many children in the world today face these same conditions.<br />The children all live in a dormitory with the other workers of the lumber mill, wondering when evil Count Olaf might make an appearance.  Eventually he does, in a somewhat surprising way.  Count Olaf appears relatively late in this book, and from the time he does the book moves and ends very quickly.  In addition to Count Olaf, we have two other characters working with him to make things bad for the children.<br />As has happened in the previous three books, the children are able, principally through their own efforts, to overcome the bad guys.  Unfortunately someone does die in a gruesome, though not detailed, way.  Once again the children are on their way to another home.<br />Of the four books thus far, this one was my least favorite.  The style of the books is such that bad things happen to these children on a regular basis, but in this book it seems as though bad things are happening to nearly everyone.  This book is very depressing.  I was also a bit annoyed with the extremes that the author went to in his exaggerations.  This time we have baby Sunny using her teeth in a sword fight, and Klaus using chewing gum to move a log, among other things.  These books have seemed to venture further and further into fantasy.<br />The educational messages in this book are somewhat weaker than in the previous three stories, but there are still some.  There are a few instances where things are explained, but less often than in the first three books.  Because of the dark, dreary images, and the death, which is not detailed to any extent, I would consider this book to be more appropriate for a 9 or 10-year-old.  However, as always, you should know your own child and her or his ability to handle the material.<br />One aspect of these books I have covered in only minimal detail in my previous reviews.  The children are incredibly self-reliant.  Often the children are the only ones who seem to know what is going on around them, and they often have to solve the problems they are in.  I think the message that children can have an effect and can take responsibility for their lives may be the most positive message in these books.  Furthermore, the children typically behave ethically and generally legally when doing so.<br />Because this book was more dreary than the previous books, and because of the ever more fantastic elements, I rate this book lower than the previous books.  However, while I think this book rates lower, I think it is still in the 4-star range.  I'm hoping for some improvement in the next book.

Furthermore, the children typically behave ethically and generally legally when doing so.<br />Because this book was more dreary than the previous books, and because of the ever more fantastic elements, I rate this book lower than the previous books.  However, while I think this book rates lower, I think it is still in the 4-star range.  I'm hoping for some improvement in the next book.  See you in the next review!	2003-04-05

On the good side, Aunt Josephine has a wonderful library and a love of books.  On the down side, Aunt Josephine is frightened of nearly everything.  Thus the trio must eat only cold food because Aunt Josephine is too frightened to turn on the stove.  Of course, her fright extends to many other clearly dangerous things (like doorknobs - never can tell when they might explode), so clearly Aunt Josephine is more than a little dysfunctional.<br />As in the previous two books, it's not long before Count Olaf shows up and begins working a plan to get the vast fortune that will go to the children when Violet turns of age.  As in the previous books, Mr. Poe, the guardian of the children's finances, is not bright enough to recognize Count Olaf until his nose is rubbed in the obvious.<br />As you might predict, the children go through a series of frightening and dangerous adventures before confronting evil Count Olaf in disguise.  These adventures include escaping from a collapsing housing, rescuing their aunt from a cave during a hurricane, and coming face-to-face with one of Count Olaf's disgusting `friends'.  Readers of this series must know how this story will end:  the children must move on to another relative while being chased by Count Olaf.<br />In comparison to the first two books Count Olaf takes a much smaller role, appear a couple of times briefly until near the end of the book.  Having Count Olaf take a smaller role was a welcome change.  Baby Sunny also takes a larger role in this book and displays an incredible amount of intelligence for a baby.  In fact, you might say that Baby Sunny has a significant role in saving the day.<br />This book again has a number of dark elements, and one portion I thought involving the leeches from Lake Lachrymose could be distressing for very young readers.  As in my previous reviews for this series, I think the age should be at least 9; however, each parent needs to judge the ability of their child to handle the subject matter.<br />This book continues the strong educational message of the first two books, both explicitly and implicitly.  Because more difficult words are explained in detail, this book is, like the first, a good transitional book for readers in the 9 to 12 age range.<br />While the images continue to be dark in this book, keeping the tradition of the first two books, they are not as dark as in the first, and are perhaps similar to those of the second book.  I recommend this book, but, but be very sure you know your child and what is in this book before you allow your child to read it.  Four stars for another good follow up to the interesting approach started in book one and continued in book two for this age range.s in my previous reviews for this series, I think the age should be at least 9; however, each parent needs to judge the ability of their child to handle the subject matter.<br />This book continues the strong educational message of the first two books, both explicitly and implicitly.

In the first book their parents died in a fire and things went drastically downhill after that.  Eventually ending with evil Count Olaf, a distant cousin, the trio tried to convince Mr. Poe, somewhat of a guardian, that Count Olaf was evil.  At the end of the book Count Olaf ran away after his various machinations were unmasked.  However, the ending was not happy because once again the orphans did not have a home.<br />In this second book, we meet Dr. Montgomery Montgomery, or Uncle Monty, as he likes being called.  At first the reader might believe that Uncle Monty's house is a bad place, for it is filled with snakes, including those of a poisonous variety.  However, the children quickly realize that Uncle Monty is actually a very nice guy, and keeps a very clean and organized house.  Soon the children actually begin to lead a normal life.<br />As our erstwhile author periodically enjoys pointing out, life is not to be happy for the Baudelaire orphans, and Count Olaf appears once again, though disguised.  It takes very little time for Uncle Montgomery to be killed; and once again the orphans risk being in a very bad situation.  Eventually, through the cleverness of the orphans, you must know that Count Olaf will somehow be unmasked, and the children saved, though to what end?<br />This book was not quite as dark as the first book, and the implied sexual situations relating to Violet did not appear to exist in this book, for which I was very happy.  However, death reappears in this book, and Count Olaf remains the evil person he was in the first.  Thus this book is likely unsuitable for most younger readers and age 9 should likely be a reasonable minimum.  A parent may also need to be prepared for questions regarding death and evil people, and perhaps even questions regarding snakes.<br />This book continues the strong educational message of the first book, both explicitly and implicitly.  Because more difficult words are explained in detail, this book is, like the first, a good transitional book for readers in the 9 to 12 age range.<br />While the images are dark in this book, they are not as dark as in the first.  I recommend this book, but, but be very sure you know your child and what is in this book before you allow your child to read it.

I had thought at first that the eight original books formed a limited series with the eighth being the last.  Apparently the torment of the Baudelaire orphans gets to continue for some length of time in the future.<br />We meet the three Baudelaire children, Violet, Klaus and baby Sunny, on a beach, on a somewhat hazy or even foggy day.  Through the fog comes Mr. Poe, a banker who takes care of their parent's financial affairs.  We discover that the gloomy day is a harbinger of Mr. Poe's even gloomier message; their parents have perished in a fire.  The story becomes even gloomier as a new home for the children means moving in with their distant cousin Count Olaf.<br />It turns out that Count Olaf seems to regard murder and possibly pedophilia as acceptable pursuits.  Count Olaf seems to find it acceptable to hang baby Sunny in a cage from a tower, and later to tell the children that all but Violet will be disposed of after he gets his hands on the fortune their parents have left to them.  Furthermore, Count Olaf and at least one other character do things that are strongly sexual in nature with respect to Violet.<br />In spite of the relatively gloomy story, there is a somewhat happy ending, though that ending segues into the setup for the next book.<br />The question is whether this book, and the series of books, is suitable for young children.  My thought is that the child reading the book should likely be at least 8 years old, and perhaps 9.  Each parent needs to decide whether their child is sufficiently mature to handle the subject matter in this book, and the subsequent books.<br />While the nearly overt sexual situations may make some parents uncomfortable, not to mention the references to torture and abuse of children, as well as death threats, given that these situations actually occur in the real world, could these books be an opportunity to explain things that can happen and do happen to people in the real world.  By recognizing characteristics of these situations, children can better be prepared to avoid such situations and even be prepared to tell someone about what they know is wrong.<br />One strong point of these books is that they have a strong educational message.  Throughout the books words are defined as they are used in conversation, making these books good transition books for children in the 9 to 12 age range.<br />We all want to protect our children as long as possible, and somehow hope they will remain innocent forever.  However, we all must grow up, and often as we grow up we must face unpleasant images.  This book presents some of those unpleasant images in a way that allows parents to address real-life concerns.  I recommend this book, but be very sure you know your child and what is in this book before you allow your child to read it.

US	44759540	R1NP0QN8SFALIK	0553582941	191153164	Sole Survivor	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Great read, the ending was not as great	I am a big fan of Dean Koontz.  I must have at least 20 of his books in hardback, and more in paperback.  Therefore you can understand how difficult it is to not recommend a Dean Koontz book very highly.<br />The story here is very intriguing.  There was a plane crash a year ago that took the life of Joe Carpenters wife and two children.  Dean Koontz makes it very evident that Joe loved his wife and children as the agony and grief of their deaths is made excruciatingly clear.  As the novel proceeds Joe receives phone calls and information that leads him to believe that his daughter Nina is still alive, no matter how impossible that may be.<br />As Joe continues to investigate this seeming impossibility, the families of other people killed in the crash begin dying, until you realize that they are being murdered.  Joe becomes obsessed with trying to find Nina.  His investigation takes him to the crash site, and to numerous locations in southern California, meeting a variety of interesting people along the way.<br />I was pulled along in this book from the beginning to the end, and ultimately read the last third or so in one sitting.  Thus far it sounds like I am recommending the book very highly.  That is because the majority of the book is a good read.  The problem comes from the ending.  While in many ways the ending was uplifting, it was a bit contrived to me, and some of the explanations left holes.  Furthermore, I was so into the character of Joe that I was a bit frustrated and angered at part of the ending.  Unfortunately I can not divulge the exact details because that would spoil the book for you.  I also understand that getting a reader emotionally into a story is perhaps one of the greatest achievements an author can have, but once you have gotten a reader that far, the emotions need satisfaction, and I struggled with the ending.<br />This book is well written, as all Dean Koontz books are.  The flaw is the ending.  If you are an avid Dean Koontz fan, likely you will find this book a good read, though you may share some of my disappointment in the ending.  If you are not a Dean Koontz fan, you may want to save this book for another time.  For newer and better examples of Dean Koontz books that I thought were very good, I recommend One Door Away From Heaven, and False Memory, which, while it has a slow start, has one of Deans best endings ever (in my humble opinion).ely you will find this book a good read, though you may share some of my disappointment in the ending.

US	44759540	R1YLUL61DRZXD3	0553580221	284106836	False Memory	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Disturbing Psychological Thriller	An old cliche says that just because you are paranoid doesn't mean that people aren't out to get you. Thus are the situations that Dusty Rhodes and his wife Martie find themselves in from beginning to end of this highly creative and often disturbing book. Things keep happening to the mental state of Dusty's wife, her best friend Susan, and Dusty's brother Skeet that seem really weird. At first you might think you are reading about the psychiatric ward at a mental hospital as various events are played out in often frustrating detail. However, you slowly come to realize that there are reasons for the mental states of each of the main characters, and the path they take to discovery is the essence of this book.<br />I found the first 200 to 250 pages of this book slow as the mental states of the various characters were played out in excruciating detail. I was more than once tempted to stop reading the book. However, my interest increased as the book went on, and by page 400 or so I had to read to the end of this roughly 750 page book without stopping. My advice is to do your best to get through the portion of the book where the characters are established to get to the meat, and you will find the time you spent was worth the effort.<br />Koontz combines the intertwined elements used so effectively by Charles Dickens in \\"David Copperfield\\" with disturbing elements of a sadist coupled to sufficiently plausible details of psychology to make you believe that this story could truly happen. Even more endearing, the principal characters are everyday people that might live next door to you and me, or might even be you and I. When the novel nears the end and Koontz neatly, yet plausibly, ties all the elements together in a Dickensian fashion, you will find multiple revelations and be amazed that you were so well and thoroughly misled by Koontz.<br />I've always been a fan of Koontz, but some of his more recent works, while quite competent, have not kept me as enthralled as some of his past works. While I was concerned that this novel was starting in the same fashion, by its completion my opinion became that this novel is one of Koontz very best. 5 stars plus for creating a believable psychological thriller that will disturb most people with graphic imagery.f his past works.

US	44759540	RG0ZQ51YRTMN9	0399148701	17508097	Red Rabbit	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Good writing, but the story is slow with little action	I have at least liked nearly all of Tom Clancy's books.  Most of them I thought were very good; several were excellent.  I've enjoyed his books so much that I believe I own all his solo efforts, and most of those I have in hardback, including this book.  Given that I find Tom Clancy to be a very enjoyable and readable author, I find this review difficult to write.<br />I would not recommend this book to a casual reader of Tom Clancy.  Furthermore, for those fans that find the action in his books to be the most enjoyable part, I would say absolutely avoid this book.  However, if you enjoy the sometimes-excruciating detail that Clancy can put into his writing, with minimal amounts of action, then this story may well appeal to you.<br />It took me quite a while to read this book.  The beginning is filled with very fine detail that helps you to understand the characters involved and their various motivations.  Much of the first half of the book almost reads like a pseudo-documentary of the various individuals and jobs involved in intelligence.  Since my experience with Clancy is that he opens the book with a significant action sequence, then has at least one intervening action sequence, and then the final sequence, I kept looking for an action sequence.  There really is very little action in this book.  In spite of the lack of action, the last 200 pages finally caught my interest and I was able to zip to the end of the book from that point forward.<br />I will try to avoid any plot spoilers, just in case you find yourself interested in buying this book, so please read on.<br />The ending of the book I thought was relatively predictable.  Unfortunately I can say little more without revealing things, so I'll just say that I was disappointed that the potential for disaster was there, and yet for the most part the flow was much smoother than what often happens in real life.<br />One particular characteristic of this book I found to be annoying.  Ryan keeps telling various individuals that the source of his information was a defector.  In real life, you never tell source sensitive information to anyone unless that person has a definable need to know.  Ryan could have explained that his information was from a sensitive source that he couldn't reveal, but he believed the information was reliable.  In the real intelligence world, such information is highly compartmentalized, and everyone knows and understands why.  I believe this aspect of the story was a slip-up by Clancy; unusual for him.<br />The book is well written.  The flow is logical and easy to follow.  The only real flaw is the lack of action from an author known as much for his action as to his attention for detail.  Had the author been any of a number of spy story authors, perhaps someone like Len Deighton, I might have had different expectations and read the book accordingly.  However, this is a Clancy book, and I didn't get what I was expecting.  The book is an okay read, but expect it to be very detail heavy and slow reading in the beginning, and the plot twists, such as they are, are minimal.ndividuals that the source of his information was a defector.

While his writing has improved, his creativity has gone, in my opinion, into a long decline.  I have to admit that he has been experimenting with his writing, trying some different things, trying to expand into other genres, but unfortunately his experimentation gets inflicted upon us, his fans, as released books.  With \\"Black House\\", Stephen King and Peter Straub find their way back to the top of the Horror heap.<br />First of all, this book does have graphic moments.  If you get queasy at the sight of blood, or reading about blood, and dripping entrails, and children being eaten by someone or something, it's time to move on to another book.  I've tried to determine whether Peter and Stephen could have written the book without the graphic detail.  I think they could have toned it down somewhat, but, I also think that they were trying as hard as possible to make you realize that that which was responsible for all the events that occurred at French's Landing was truly evil, and could not possibly be suffered to exist in our world.<br />Does the writing focus too much on scenery?  Authors' choice.  Furthermore, the goal of the authors was to set up how perfectly NORMAL the town was.  How perfectly MUNDANE all these people are.  These people are almost stereotypes.  However, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE!  The shock of the animal among us is best if the animal is inflicting himself on normal, quiet suburban families.  When Van Helsing goes out to hunt vampires, we expect to see vampires.  When you go to the local convenience store, you do not expect to be abducted by someone that's going to eat your liver raw, perhaps while you are still alive.<br />Do you need to know what happened in \\"The Talisman\\" to read this book?  No.  You will want to read \\"The Talisman\\" after reading this book.  The only contrived part of this book was the references in it to the Gunslinger books and to \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\".  The references are insider references that will be lost on some people who aren't avid Stephen King readers.<br />The body of the book is an excellent setup for the end of the book, about which I will reveal nothing.  Historically I've found many of Stephen King's endings weak.  However, not in \\"Black House\\".  The ending here is superb, very tight, and very appropriate.  Enough discussion about the ending.<br />This book was written for the journey, as a long book should be, and not the ending.  The enjoyment is in the travel, not the destination.  In this case the journey is enjoyable, though the authors manage to build the suspense so slowly and inexorably that you often want to flip to the last chapters and find out what is going on because the pace of story development is almost too slow for those of us used to the instant gratification of movies and video games.  And yes, the lack of punctuation was intentional in that sentence.<br />If you like Stephen King, particularly his early work, and if you like Peter Straub, you'll love this book.  I have only read a little of Peter Straub, and his writing is okay, but I've read nearly everything Stephen King has written.  This book is excellent writing for both.  In fact, I really enjoyed \\"The Talisman\\", which is a fantasy.  I think that both gentlemen should write more books together.

Stephen Sears has put together a series of essays regarding the most controversial of the top commanders and some of the most embarrassing moments of the Army of the North during the Civil War.  It was most interesting to me to see how the personalities of the commanders involved played such a big part in making the war longer and more deadly for both sides than it should have been.  After reading this book, it's a wonder the south didn't win.<br /><br />General McClellan was so extremely conservative that his decisions were based on assumptions that had no basis in fact.  McClellan repeatedly avoided engagements with inferior and disadvantaged forces simply because he didn't know better.  It's easy to see from these essays why our modern military emphasizes communication and intelligence above all else.<br /><br />Exploiting the setbacks of McClellan and the things that happened to a number of his field commanders, regardless of whether they were truly at fault, were other Northern commanders trying to obtain more power and influence.  The U.S. Army of the Civil War was clearly much more politically motivated than today's army, with politics frequently outweighing military decisions.  Naturally the southern commanders frequently took advantage of the mistakes the North made with their incorrect assumptions.<br /><br />Sears admittedly makes some assumptions when facts are not available, but Sears clearly states his assumptions and guesses.  You will not be led astray by mistaking fact from supposition.<br /><br />If you have an interest in why the North made some of the mistakes they did during the Civil War, pick up this book.  Each of the essays is well-written and easy to follow.  The end of the book leaves you wanting more.  I highly recommend this book.	2002-05-22
