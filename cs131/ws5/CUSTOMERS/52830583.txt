US	52830583	R22IFBZNTMIOND	0195151747	846543535	Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A detailed look at Mid-East War	The author's knowledge of the subject matter is evident throughout the book.  While the book covers both the political and military aspects of the war, the author's strength clearly lies in his intimate knowledge of the Israeli political system.  Many of the chapters take the reader into the inner chambers of the Israeli political and military command.  The book is politically balanced, but the author did not appear to have the same level of access for the Arab side as he did for the Israeli.  As a result a larger percentage of the book describes the how Israel dealt with the crisis.  It was amazing to read how many of today's major Mid-East leaders, where also involved in the 1968 war.	2003-03-03

This well researched and extremely detailed biography captures the major challenges that TR faced while president.  It is impossible to read this book without comparing it to \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt.\\"  The material was not as exciting as the first book, where TR was an adventurer, rancher, mercenary, hunter, and politician.  In \\"Theodore Rex\\" he was merely the President of United States.  Some of the chapters seemed to be more informational filler vice historical analysis, but this was not a major distraction.  The work is politically well balanced.  Morris's use of language slows down the work when he uses obscure works and drawn out sentence structure.	2003-02-16

The author successfully captures the many sides of General Patton, going beyond the rather one-sided interpretation in the movie \\"Patton\\".  The first sections of the book center on the general's early personnel life.  Many of these chapters drag, but once the book enters into the battle chapters the author's skill and intimate knowledge of military history really shines.  The author spends considerable time detailing the personnel relationships between Patton and the Army's top generals such as Eisenhower, Bradley, and Clark.	2003-02-01

The author successfully describes Mid-East culture, not by quoting long dead historians or re-hashing other people research, but by visiting the region first hand.  When the author visits a country he does not simply reserve a room at the local Sheraton and report from the hotel bar, like so many foreign correspondents.  Instead, he moves out into the street, befriends locals, and stays in their hotels and eats where they eat.  The author does not claim to be an academic expert on Arab culture, but I believe this frees him to make observations that are not weighed down by academic requirements.  The author's sense of humor is an added bonus.  While the book was written over 10 years ago, it still holds up well.  This book is more than a travel book, it is a first rate description of Arab culture from the gritty streets of the Middle East.	2003-01-17

Beever book accurately portrays one of the most horrendous battles of World War II.  The author successfully switches from strategic and operational descriptions of the battle to small tactical stories of personnel fortitude.  The book is not for the faint of heart; many of the paragraphs graphically depict the battle, and lives of the men and women who suffered through it.  There was nothing romantic or sentimental about the battle of Stalingrad.	2002-11-13

The author describes in great lengths the details of early man and how he developed in different parts of the world. European culture has come to dominate mainly because they were the first to have domesticated animals and crops. If the Africans had them first we would be living in an Afro-dominated world. While I leaned much about early history, I never convinced of the author's major argument. He completely disregarded the role of culture and ideas on societal development, and labeled anyone who stated that some societies were better at doing certain tasks than others as racist. I found this tone smothering and prevented the book from being intellectually valid.	2002-10-17

While it was written in 1976 it still hold up well, though some new information on the role of GCHQ and signals intelligence has been released since 1976. I am still amazed at the scope of operations the British ran during World War II. A very well written book, though it is by know means a quick read. It took me almost a month to get through it.

He could appear at home in a Mongolian dust storm and an Upper East Side pallor.  The book balances the many facets of his life, giving equal time to the travel, science, and personnel accomplishments of Roy Chapman.  There is no doubt that he was a product of his times, backed by the rich, he traveled to the developing world, excavated thousands of relics and dinosaur bones and took them out of the country for display in a New York museum.  In today's political landscape this could no longer occur, but to lessen his accomplishments by applying today's standards to his time period is revisionist history of the worst guide.  The author does a solid job defending Roy Chapman from these illogical attacks.  Roy Chapman's rise from small town high school graduate to global explorer and director of a major museum is the basis of the American spirit	2002-09-24

McCarthy's Bar spins a wife array of enjoyable stories about Irish travel, while mixing in insightful commentary on the true meaning of being Irish.  I starting reading this book on vacation and quickly found the nearest pub.  After two pints of Guinness the book got even better.  The writing style is crisp and the humor is....well Irish.

The Forgotten Soldier describes the often over-looked Eastern Front. The story tells the truth of combat, it is not about glory, god, or country. It is about survival. Do not believe any hype that the book is fiction. The author is French and has lived in France since the war. He would have nothing to gain by writing a book about his time fighting for the Germans in World II. The book dispels the myth about superior German leadership. The Germans were just as willing as any to send thousands of their young men into pointless battles that could not be won. Though I was amazed at the German logistic system, which was able to supply its armies for thousands of miles into Russia. While the logistic system eventually collapsed, it lasted longer than any others would have. You will never forget the later half of the book that describes the German retreat across Russia, Ukraine, and Poland. The book is translated from French so you need to overlook a few details lost in translation. Anybody who considers themselves a World War II buff has to add this to their collection.	2002-05-07

His time in Azerbaijan got him a front row seat to the crumbling edges of the Soviet empire.  The author describes well how chaotic modern war can be.  Since he was one of the few Americans in Azerbaijan at the time, since the oil boom had yet to begin, he stuck up relationships with many characters that go on to rule Azerbaijan.  Ten years after the fact the combat writing holds up well, but the political chapters have not.  The author does not seem to hide that he is pro-Azeri.  You can sense his rage as he tries unsuccessfully to get anybody in the Western media to care about the war.  A good editor could have chopped this book down by a third and made it a better read.  Azeri's love the book, Armenians hate it,  but what would you expect.	2002-05-05

D'Este skillfully combines detailed historical analysis with interesting first hand accounts.  The result is a highly readable book.  The author uses the first several chapters to set the scene and explain the historical significance of the operation.  There are extended passages on the conflicts between the Allied commanders.  The central section of the book describes the actual conduct of the operation.  The chapters cover the battle at the tactical level and include many short personnel stories.  The author moves easily from strategic conflicts between Allied generals to the day-to-day struggle of the infantrymen in the mud of Anzio.  The author is not afraid to state an opinion and all views are backed up by significant evidence.  This makes the work more than just a collection of war stories.  The only quirk I found was D'este obvious admiration of German generals and the German military in general.  While he goes to great length to point out the weakness of Allied leadership, the Germans are let off rather lightly, despite the fact that in the end they lost.	2002-04-11

Jenkins work did not compare. His writing was drawn out and labored, with extensive references to obscure members of the British aristocracy and long passages on parliamentary procedures. The author's constant reminder of his own career in parliament was an annoying distraction. The book's strongest section was the chapters on Churchill's wartime conferences with FDR and Stalin. I have always admired Churchill and I was looking for a well-written comprehensive biography. I am still searching for that book.	2002-03-15

This superbly researched book on the German military is not for the casual reader of military history.  The Kaiser's Army is an in-depth discussion of German military reforms during the end of the 19th century.  It describes Germany's attempts to move from a traditional to a modern army as technological advances race forward.  The description of the various debates between reformers and traditionalists is excellent.  The book is a great study in how a large organization, The Germany Army, struggles with change.  The sections dealing with the birth of small unit tactics is worthy of merit.  The only draw back is the last quarter of the book when the author falls into a history of World War I.  The author covers too much general history of the War and not enough focus on what made the rest of the book so good, the role of technology and military reform.  I recommend this book for any serious follower of European military history.	2002-01-21

The author has written several previous books on the subject, by this version is geared to a wider audience beyond historians. I enjoyed how Ellis stated that the founding fathers were aware they were making history and to varying degrees working to ensure their image was correctly portrayed by history. The book reads quickly and never gets bogged down. There are no radical theories and more in-depth books have been written on the subject, but that in no way reduces the quality of the work. While the author has been proven a liar about his own life, I believe he is honest about his historical work	2002-01-07

Like America at the turn of the 19th century, he had a limitless belief in himself and the greatness of his future.  He seemed to fit seven lives into one.  This book only covered his birth until his presidency and yet, what he lived was enough the fill multiple biographies of lesser men.  I enjoyed Morris's style because it did not get in the way.  He was able to be both academic, while also telling an engaging story.  A rare feet among history writers, though I did notice Morris did seem to fall in love with his subject.	2002-01-06

(I was born in NY and now live in Virginia). I was happily surprised to see that it was not. The author describes the modern south through the lens of the civil war. The characters and stories are better than any fiction.  His statements on the importance of the civil may be a bit overblown, since he mainly spoke with people with a heavy interest in the war. Like most American students I fear that southern children know very little about the war.  The book reads well and it very enjoyable. I would call it travel writing with an historical twist. For military history buffs it is a nice break from the usual style.	2001-12-26

The author did extensive research using German sources to describe part of World War II that few knew about.  The most interesting part of the book was not the extensive German organization, no surprise there, but the complete lack of organization on the American side.  The U.S. was extremely slow in adopting to meet the threat.  The Navy was battleship based.  Admirals and Captains wanted large sea battles with other battleships, not hide and seek anti-submarine warfare.  As a result, they were unprepared to defend the East Coast from submarine attack.  It was amazing the Germans did not do more damage than they did.  Check this book out.	2001-12-17

It was interesting the see how each culture, Americans in the late 1800s and American Indians, picked their leaders.  The research is thicker on Custer, due to the vastly more complete written record.  The history of Crazy Horse is based more on oral history of events long since passed.  Pay no attention to reviewers that say this is not \\"the historical book on Custer.\\"  A book does not have to be a 1200 page tome to be a great book.  Ambrose makes history vibrant and meaningful, a trait lost on most academic historians.	2001-12-15

Baseball has serious problems that are keeping it from being a completive league.  Costas describes clearly how the income differences between teams is hurting the game.  Both the owners and the players are at fault.  Each side is portrayed as caring mainly about their own interests vice the overall health of the game.  Even though this book is 2-3 years old, baseball has not addressed any of the major issues in the book, so it is still current.

He is held to a very high standard. His books on WWII are introducing whole new generations to the defining moment of our history. His skills go beyond WWII. His book on Lewis and Clark was amazing. If this book was by any other author everyone would love it, but compared to the rest of his collection this book is not the gold standard.
