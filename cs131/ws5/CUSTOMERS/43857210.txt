Viewers were rewarded with a witty script that managed to overcome the shoddiness of its special effects budget.<br />The novelization tries to copy the broadcast, but doesn't really capture the humor of the performances.

The writer had a quite a challenge on his hands.  The broadcast story only two episodes long, and it took place entirely inside of the TARDIS!  This turns out to be an advantage, since the author uses the extra space to develop the somewhat sketchy characters on the show.  Barbara really comes out, and the Doctor is also given some nice character shading.  All in all, a pleasant nostalgic romp.	2001-05-29

It didn't help that TTD is an awful story, full of both unpleasant characters, annoying twins, and giant slugs.<br />The novelization, instead of toning down the 6th Doctor's unpleasant new persona, decides to jack it up a notch and make him even more irritating.

Like all &quot;regeneration&quot; stories, this one is a bit uneven, as the character of the new Doctor is always a work in progress.  Even so, die-hard fans love the scene with the 4th Doctor appearing for the first time in his beloved 16' scarf.<br />Like many of the early Target novels, &quot;Robot&quot; is written at the young teen level, so older fans will find the book a bit simplistic.  And, sadly, this is not the very best Tom Baker story, filled as it is with a raft of carboard characters and a very embarrasing robot.  I really only recommend this book for the hard core Who fan.	2001-05-29

This is mixed blessing; on the one hand, it's great to see Ace, on the other, Ace is now a jerk!  I know she was upset at the Doctor at the end of her last appearance, but that doesn't make it any more appealing.<br />The other problem with this novel is it's vagueness.  The Doctor et al land on your typical generic planet, with typical generic people.  Nothing about the setting is terribly interesting.  While it does turn out there's something significant about this, it doesn't really make this a very gripping read.  The reuse of the maze scene from &quot;Horns of Nimon&quot; is a bad idea.	2001-05-25

The title story is a fine exploration of both survivor's guilt and the healing power of religious ecstasy.  &quot;Trips&quot; is an playful take on the now over-used cliche of the alternate universe; no real conclusion, but still a fun ride.

Okay, I admit it--I'm a sucker for almost anything with punk rock in it.  The idea of a Doctor Who story set in the turbulent years of the British punk era sounded great.  After finishing it, it wasn't quite as great as I'd hoped.  The biggest problem is that this story is the end of a story arc, and story arcs always have a problem trying to beat the hype.<br />Cornell does a fine job with the character of the Doctor and the Brig, but Ace comes across as a bitter border-line sociopath.  Benny is given the thankless role of pretending to be a Poly Styrene-clone.  There's also the problem of trying to fit this story into the Who timeline (the Brig should have been retired from UNIT by the time of this story), but that's only of concern to hardcore Who nitpickers (like me!).<br />A good, not great story.	2001-05-25

Even such sacred cows as the Tom Baker years get the same tough love as the worst of the Pertwee years.<br />What really made this book interesting for me was the authors obvious well-read background, which came out in the &quot;Roots&quot; sections.  It's here that you can see the sources for some of the many tropes of Who (and all TV SF, for that matter).<br />I was a bit put off by the insistence of the authors to find a gay subtext in virtually every Who episode.  Apparently British Who fandom has a very vocal guy section, some of who are intent on proving that many Who characters are gay.  Whatever floats your boat.....<br />If you're a Who fan...well, you probably already own this!  If you're not, you still will get a chuckle out of this book.	2001-05-25

However, I was a bit dismayed at Asimov's heavy-handed critique of Swift in the 3rd book.  As many readers of Swift know, the 3rd book contains a very harsh criticism of science and technology.  Asimov decides to use his annotations to defend science.  While his aims are certainly admirable, I think that he takes Swift's comments out of context in an effort to prove his own case.<br />That minor cavil aside, this is an excellent book for young people studying this great classic of literature, and for fans of both Swift and Asimov.	2001-05-25

That is, he can subconsciously affect the feelings of others.  The Doctor, as happens in too many of the original novels, gets pushed into the background while we get a group of not quite as interesting new characters foisted upon us.

Not only did the story cause a lot of problems with Who continuity, but there was also the added irony that the show was on trial as well (the BBC came close to canceling it that season).<br />In my opinion, one of the major problems with Who during this time was the pulpy, badly plotted stories of Pip and Jane Baker.  How they managed to to write so many Who scripts is beyond me.  If anything, their work novelizing their own scripts was even worse.  They manage to incorporate every pulpy, said-bookism cliche possible.  Luckily the Target novelizations are only 120 pages long, so Who fans can sail through this book without too much pain, all the time wishing that someone would break P&amp;J Baker's exclamation mark key.	2001-05-25

Both Baker's long tenure and strong personality had resulted in most fans thinking of him as the only Doctor, rather than the 4th.  The producers, taking a rather risky move, decided to cast an actor that was the exact opposite of Baker's interpretation.  Years later, many are still debating whether or not this was a good idea.<br />The &quot;Handbook&quot; series provide a detailed behind the scenes view of the Doctor Who show, including many insights into the development of the characters, and the difficulties faced.  My favorite section is the scene by scene disectiion of an episode by the show's creative team.<br />A must for the serious Who fan.	2001-05-25

Its post-60's decline and fall only accentuated its former greatness.<br />This collection, ostensibly a 30th anniversary salute, instead becomes a sort of gripe-fest, with the writers complaining about legendary editor Horace Gold's overbearing editing, or the magazine's later problems with funding.<br />In spite of this, we're still left with a collection of rare greats.  Pohl managed to put together a collection of excellent but seldom reprinted works (pretty tough when one of authors is Harlan Ellison).  If you find this book, snap it up!	2001-05-25

Okay, I have become a Dave Stone fan, espcially of his Doctor Who books, but this also means I've become aware of his more irritating qualities.  That includes his tendency to include very, very strange aliens, scene changes right in the middle of the action, and a lot of DouglasAdams-isms.  D&amp;D is probably the worst offender in the Virgin Doctor Who range (with Sky Pirates! in a dead heat), and is further hampered by having to include the improbable romance between Jason and Benny.<br />On the plus side, the Doctor is (there's no other word for it) awesome!  He's almost supernatural in this book, and I loved every minute he was on the page.  Which wasn't enough.	2001-05-24
US	43857210	R83GA1XSQXF2Y	081601356X	189187096	The Encyclopedia of Super Villains	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Amazingly thorough reference book	This is Rovin's companion piece to his &quot;Encyclopedia of Superheroes&quot;, and is every bit as well researched.  Try to think up the most obscure comic book or TV serial supervillain--he or she is in here.  If I had to find a quibble, it's that this book includes the nemeses of superheroes that were not listed in the former book; for example, you'll find entries for the Master, but Doctor Who was not in TEOSH.<br />A must own for comic book, SF, and adventure film/TV buffs alike.	2001-05-24
US	43857210	R1VML23NQD2I5D	0523425066	866925178	Doctor Who #009: Android Invasion	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A good novelization of a classic story	&quot;The Android Invasion&quot; was one of the classic Tom Baker stories from the BBC-TV days.  While the climax didn't quite take off, the opening was quite memorable.  The Target novelization does a fine job in creating the flavor fo feel of the old story, and has the advantage of not being hampered by sub-par special effects ;-).  No hard-core Who fan should be without it.	2001-05-24
US	43857210	R3J3WAWQIPRVQU	0563538082	754053817	The Banquo Legacy (Doctor Who)	Books	2	3	4	N	N	Not that good	&quot;The Banquo Legacy&quot; suffers by obviously being a non-Doctor Who novel with Doctor Who grafted onto it.  A typical, almost cliched gothic mystery is given a few SF motifs, and a very trite explanation is given for the Doctor and Fitz's involvement (Compassion is almost a non-player).<br />Not the worst EDA, but it does manage to mark time until the next novel, the end of the Faction Paradox cycle.	2001-05-24
US	43857210	R2DMRKIZ3QLFOT	0883551284	559123019	Science Fiction by Gaslight: A History and Anthology of Science Fiction in the Popular Magazines, 1891-1911 (Classics of Science Fiction)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	For science fiction historians.	It's been a long time since I read this anthology, but it has always stuck in my mind.  Not because the stories were that incredible, but because it proves that there's nothing (much) new under the sun.  The stories within contain many of the now famous tropes of SF--pollution, strange beasts, mechanical men, and so.  Yet every story here was written before the 20th century!<br />The late Sam Moskowitz was a dedicated archivist of all things SF.  If you are a student of the genre, you will enjoy this collection.	2001-05-24

He could have used this book as a tell-all slam against Disney, but decided to instead to draw a loving picture of his work for the Mouse. And \\"draw\\" in the right word--Kinney realized that he was no writer, so the book is packed full of his rough, humorous sketches of his fellow animators from the 30's to the 50's.<br />The latter half of the book is the saddest, with Kinney on his own trying to make cartoons during the Dark Ages of animation (the 1960's). Still, his love for the art kept him going.<br />If you want a small experience of the golden age of animation, without all the technical details, then this book is for you.	2001-05-24
