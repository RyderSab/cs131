US	53023613	R2U406BNKWSVU6	068480025X	999720718	Five Past Midnight	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Decent WWII Intrigue	The assignment to go assasinate Hitler in his own underground bunker is not your typical orders except for a super commando who is pitted against a German commando whose assignment is to stop our man who has been sent by Franklin Roosevelt.  The description of the anguish and futlility of the German civilians in Berlin during the constant bombing is very vivid and conveyed to this reader some of the misery that was being experienced.  This requires good wordsmithing.  The plot held my attention and I thought that for a cold blooded murderer, Captain Jack Cray displayed a unique sense of humor that should have been contrary to the imagine that was trying to be portrayed.  I found this very refreshing in lieu of the seriousness of his predicament.  This was a good read.	2001-12-02

I found the book rather exciting especially with the outcome of people like Saddam Huessin.  The book also factored in the frustration that exists when members of our Congress put their personal egos and futures ahead of the security of our nation.  I believe that such arrogance by our Congress may have already surfaced with our present struggles with our invisible enemies from abroad. I also found several type written errors in the book and one obvious mis use of a word.  However it did not affect my enjoyment of the book.	2001-12-01

However, I found Cuba somewhat hard to understand.  Having traveled there, Castro certainly does not need a book by his daughter to discredit himself.  The country is the pits. It speaks for itself.  Castro is an unintelligent clown.  The embargo is nothing but an excuse by Cubans to explain the starvation and oppression I saw in Bayamo and Santiago de Cuba. A complete police state.  I have travelled other communist countries that we have not embargoed and found the same conditions.  Wake up cubans, you have nothing to lose but the ties that bind you. The ties just happens to be a man named Fidel Castro and his henchmen.	2001-07-25

Castro has been in power for 42 years and has managed to absolutley demolish the country. Those poor people have nothing and are ready for change.  Coonts captures the aura that exists in Cuba today and puts it to a fast pace plot that leads one to believe could actually have happened.  I really enjoyed the book and could relate to the various locations discussed in the book.  This added to the enjoyment and intrigue for me.  Very good book.	2001-06-25

Normally when we are reading about bizarre and disgusting behavior such as the holocaust,  slavery or the crusades, we are reading history books. The people of Iraq  are exposed to these conditions even as I write this review. While the book  possessed some fairly self serving disclaimers from the author it  nevertheless communicated a horrendous condition that is hard to absorb. I  actually flinched at some of the descriptions of the acts of inhumanity  perpetrated by this barbaric family ruling the country of Iraq. When you  have completed reading this book just ask yourslef one question: is it good  to live in America?	2000-06-18

I have often wondered about life in Saudi Arabia and how it came about to exist.  The book is educational from a historical viewpoint since I had  very little information to begin with.  However, it is quite apparent that  the author detests the ruling House and has apparently been exposed to some  very bitter experiences. This is prevalent in his writing and thus it is  hard to separate accurate history from mud slinging. Nevertheless, it did  introduce me to life in Saudi Arabia and some of the many complicated  issues affecting this country. The ire of the author's pen just overshadows  any objectivity one would like to associate with the relaying of history.	2000-06-18

It is amazing to me that such a gifted storyteller can end a book in this manner and not realize that he has not completed the story. I did not  understand the ending and I don't understand how he can just drop a period  at the end of a sentence with no closure to the plot. Doesn't he realize  what he has done and that readers would be critical of this apparent abrupt  disregard for bringing his plot to an exciting and thought provoking  ending? He, as an acclaimed author, must surely be aware of what he was  doing.  What was going through his mind when the decision was made to end  the book?	2000-05-30

If one ever saw any merit of being frightened of communisim they would be  classified as paranoid and having facist leanings. McCarthy had many faults  and may have gone too far in his accusations without proof.  However, the  fact remains that there were communists in our government working against  our concept of democracy.

I have been in  China, East Germany and the old Soviet Union. I am not a big supporter of  Joe McCarty, but the concerns of communists in our government working  against us should never be taken lightly. The consequences could be costly.

Neither in high school or in college was there anything taught about this man. The entire life of Hitler and his henchmen is an open book including the Nurenburg trials. The blame  of the war in Europe is not in question and had Hitler been taken alive I  am positive he would have been tried as a war criminal and would have met  the same fate as the boys in Nurenburg. The conduct of Japan in the war was  just as vicious and barbaric as Germany.  However, Hirohito got to remain  on his throne and continue to live a privledged life for himself and his  family. This book tries to explain how this all happened.  It also comes  close to holding the Emperor totally responsible and accountable for what  took place.  I have read other books on the war with Japan and they have  been so distorted and biased that one would be led to believe that the  United States bombed Pearl Harbor and blamed Japan.  This book takes an  objective approach to analyzing the many issues contributing to the war and  allows the readers to decide for themselves as to cause and blame.  The  author does not hold back from criticizing the Emperor or their system  which I had not experienced in my past readings. He both crticizes and  praises both McCarthur and the United States.  I really felt that I learned  some history by reading this.	2000-01-18

However, for some reason there had been very little non academic books written with the back drop of Japan and how we dealt with  all the complicated issues concerning the differences in our two cultures  in our efforts to remold Japan. This book opened my eyes somewhat and I  found it very interesting. It contains history, inside information,  intrigue and romance	1999-09-12

The romantic aspect of fighting  democracy, as we define the term, that was in vogue in the 60's, suddenly  takes a realistic turn in this book so that readers can acutally see the  viciousness of what was being praised by some of our studentsof the day.

Only Brown's forte is airplanes and in the course of his plot he  wants you to know as much about the operations of an airplane as he does.  This creates many pages which I just gloss over hoping that something else  in the overall plot will surface which will hold my attention. I did not  even finish this book.	1999-07-18

I found his writing absolutely on a very low level. His writing ability  reminds me of some of the pathetic attempts by some of our great authors of  the 60's. They were so engrossed in smashing people in the mouth with their  political beliefs and disgust with America that the rest of the sheep on  our campuses would embrace such nonsense as being scholarly and thought  provoking. Roberts wants to review this very serious situation in Iraq as  sort of a &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; while discussing butchery.	1999-07-13

It brings into focus the fact that we have some very young and  inexperienced people working in Wasington D.C. in important and high  positions which can get things very messed up for this country because of  their immaturity and lack of experience. As a former clerk of an appellate  court, I could relate some stories that would be equally entertaining yet  scary. It showed accurately some of the operations of the Court and the  narrative was stated in the true manner in which young people communicate  with each other. Most successful up and comers have had a friend which  needed special attention and the Holden Caufield of this story added a  funny demension.  I enjoyed this concoction of personalities who were  struggling to make it in a very cold and impersonal city .	1998-09-20
