ALthough there were courtroom scenes in the book the story was told not from a Lawyer's perspective but from the town's newspaper owner.  Found the main character courageous as he took a newspaper famous mainly for lenghthy obituaries to doubling the circulation by printing what he felt the town NEEDED to know about situations that had been ignored for many years.  <br /> <br />	2004-08-28

How they put all this together I find, just fascinating. Although they had a  few &quot;squealers&quot; that gave them some breaks but they also had to work very hard to convince a jury of their guilt.  <br />I have watched interviews on TV of Leslie VanHouten and Patricia Krenwinkel and even though they seem re-habilitated as long as there are Tate family members alive, I don't think they will ever be let out. And then there's Charlie, what a nutcase!!<br />How one man, (with the help of drugs) could have brain-washed so many people to do whatever he said is mind-boggling. <br />You won't be sorry you read this book, even though at times it will scare you half to death. It is very well written and extremely interesting.	2004-04-05

I read them too and found them to be enjoyable.  <br />In this one Judy just wants to be famous SO bad especially after her younger brother Stink, gets to go to the White House and one of her classroom rivals wins a spelling bee.  She, along with her closest friends, try hard to become \\"famous\\". Her first attempt of trying to make people believe that she actually has a cherry pit that belonged to George Washington end hilariously. Later she sees a chance to win a contest at the local pet store but at the last minute that one goes awry. <br />Judy does finally achieve \\"stardom\\" and it is very heartwarming. <br />You will enjoy these books as well as your children. My 8 year old son just loves them and can't wait for the next one. If your child enjoys the Junie B books, they will probably like these as well.	2004-01-24

He was intent on not reading it at first because he thought it was a \\"girls book\\", but when we finished it the other day he was actually disappointed.  I found it to be heartwarming and funny. Especially her turnaround in feelings about the \\"eats paste\\" kid and the TP club.  He seemed to enjoy it a lot, you will too.	2003-12-13

Like Roses are Red, it ends with many  loose ends that need to be tied up in another book. It almost seems as if he was in a hurry to finish the book and only touched on things that should have been covered more. My only hope is that it doesn't take two years before the next book comes out. <br />But as I said, it is a great read and you will thoroughly enjoy it. Many twists and turns that will keep you interested from the first page.	2003-11-26

I read it in one sitting. When you start this book, make sure you have a free day because you won't be able to put it down.   The author certainly did his research.
