Everything moved at a fast pace without enough interaction between the two main characters. Love at first sight is all well and good but you need some meat along with those potatoes.  The idea of a black woman, alone in a southern town that showed their prejudice openly with only one or two allies should have been meatier.	2004-01-21

I feel it should have been longer with more action because the concept of \\"the children\\" warranted more. I also felt it moved a little to fast without enough character build up. There were certain characters I would have like to have known more about.  However, it was still a very enjoyable read. Ms. Morris will be publishing an extended version of The Days of the Children called \\"Angels\\" in the near future.	2003-09-23

Ms. Shayne choose not to delve into the crimes to deeply which left it open for the romance of Vincent and Holly to develop.  And there is  great satisfaction in the ending of this book as the sicko gets exactly whats coming to him.  Its a very good read and a credit to her.	2001-10-27

Asa and Zain are wonderful characters. Their relationship developed beautifully.  I thought Zain's  zeal to help Asa overcome her &quot;addiction&quot; sweet and amusing.  He was determined to help her with her &quot;problem&quot; no matter the costs.  Gotta love a man like that.   I found Ms. Starr's approach to Asa's diabetes very informative and it absolutely gave the book more substance. Even though diabetes can be a serious ailment, Ms. Starr was able to bring humor into the situation through misconceptions and misunderstandings. This is a indeed one of her best books to date	2001-10-13

I thought the female model a little too large and the male model a little too spindly for her.   I think they should try to find models who favor characters in the book.  These two definitely do not.  But don't let that turn you away because the Leela and Jack characters look nothing like them. Once you get past the cover, you'll enjoy the book.   Although there was not many sexual situations, there was definit sexual tension and enough turmoil with Leela and Jack to keep it interesting.	2001-10-04

This book was extremely detailed and that's good but I felt that there was to much time spent on the details and not enough on the relationship between the two characters.  At times, I was tempted to put it down because whenever Shanna took a bath it was described in detail.  The chemistry between Shanna and Craig was minimal and the usual tension was missing.  And although I believe in family, there was way too much family in this book.   This is the second book I've read by Ms. Dickerson and I'm hesitant to buy another.  Missing Link lacked that certain something that I look for when reading a romance novel.	2001-10-04

It brings to mind the importance of family and acceptance of all the members within.  Not only warmly written but sexy and hot too.

I know movies rarely do justice to any book. And whadoyaknow, I WAS RIGHT. The book was thoroughly enjoyable. If you've watched the movie, disregard all that you have seen. Jeff and Jade are wonderful characters and I commend Ms. Anderson inclusion of the true facts regarding the homeless. Not all are crazy and drug addicts, some are there through no fault of their own. All in all, you'll really love this book. Don't let that awful BET movie deter you.	2001-08-24

Who I their right mind would marry anyone that hated their race. That in itself was totally unbelievable. I don't know how this could be categorized as a romance because there was none. I just didn't understand how a woman could lie down and open herself to a racist knowing she is the very persona of his hatred. Camille's character was just as unlikable as her ability to forget her family and heritage. This could have been a better book had the author showed a little self-preservation that a normal life-loving person would exercise.	2001-08-24

I forced myself to finish. It had all the makings of truly good read. The plot was great and the characters were interesting. Or so I thought. The Blake character waffled too much, sometimes he loved her, sometimes he didn't. A very irritating trait in any man. Melinda was somewhat interesting but her accepting attitude towards Blake's indecision reminded me of a floor mat. I really enjoyed Ms. Forster's earlier books and this one will not stop me from reading any future ones, however, I'd skip this one and go read &quot;Against the Wind&quot; were I you. It's one of her best works.	2001-08-07

However, the authors moved the story along a little to fast.  Because of the fast pace of the story the characters lacked real depth.  Even the secondary characters got together to fast, You really didn't see much of their relationship, and all of the sudden their married.  Although I do happen to like a story that moves along, I think they should have concentrated more on Paige's and Linc's relationship. Instead of using the destiny thing the should have let it develop more naturally. I wouldn't mind trying these authors again.	2001-08-02

Ms. Forster wrote a book giving the main characters dignity and intelligence.  I loved the positivity of Leslie's approach to her education and Ozzie's  self-respect as a black man fallen on hard times and his unwillingnes to give up.

Ms. Dickerson tried to make Jennifer have problems with not having family roots therefore she was so sad and frightened that Micheal wouldn't want her. I think Micheal's character should have been a little more forceful. He seemed weak and unsure of himself. The situation with Tawana was kind of stupid. What man would believe that he impregnated a woman that's a known liar. This book just didn't strike any chords. She wrote alot about nothing. Very weak and unrealistic.	2001-08-02

This is the first book that I have read of Ms. Hodge's and I have to say I was extremely dissapointed.  Samone's character was impossible to like, she was so needy of Max that she has an abortion in order to keep him.    She doesn't want to have a baby and become a statistic at her age.  Gimme a Break!!! What a idiotic and selfish reason. In the meantime, Max couldn't make up his mind about Samone and he was foolin around with other women.  Jon is so in love with Samone yet he starts messin with someone else.  There was no real meat in this book.  The characters were shallow and self-serving.  The love she tried to create between Samone and Jon just didn't work because neither of them seemed to know what it was.  It's rare that I read a book and don't empathize with any of the characters.  There was no one to like except for Samone's friend.     Do yourself a favor, save your money and your time.	2001-07-15
