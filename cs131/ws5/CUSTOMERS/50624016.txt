A comet on a deadly course to destroy the plane Thanet.  A child bound to the comets interior.  A hate for a people who forgotten about the war 5,000 years ago.  A religion on the line.  And a starship crew that must solve a 5,000 year old mystery before it's too late.  &quot;Do Comets Dream?&quot;  is one of the best Star Trek books I have ever read.  The words on the page make you feel that you're right there, on Thanet.  Right there,  in Kio's mind.  Right there, on the Enterprise.<br />If you want something good to read, something you can really get in to, something that can make you think, then I recommend this book to you.  &quot;Do Comets Dream?&quot; is well worth your money.	2003-09-03

The Genesis Wave: books 1 & 2 were two of the best books I ever read.  So naturally, when I heard about book 3 I thought it would be just as good.  But it was terrible!  It's slow, boring, and off the subject.  The Genesis Wave: book 3, seemed to me, to be more about Picard's love affair with a fake Romulan rather than the Genesis wave.<br />I thought that this book was more along the line of a sequel to John Vornholt's Gemworld series (which was also a very good read).  It's like he took the two book series and blended them together.  <br />I don't really recommend this book to anyone.  I like John Vornholt, and the way he writes, but this book just isn't worth your time and money.	2003-08-20

There were a couple of good parts in the book...and the part that we find out that Q is babysitting someone, please! <br />Then all the cursing doesn't make it any better.  I don't think that they needed curse words to amplify what they were saying.  I say the cursing alone is a good reason not to read this book.<br />Peter David wrote a good story...but not a good book for reading.<br />I would not recommend this book to anyone!	2001-09-21
