While the projects are fantastic, I don't think all of them are for beginners.  They are, however, extremely inspiring and beautifully made.<br />The book is very heavy on box-making (duplicate info in Barbara Mauriello's book &quot;Making Memory Boxes&quot;), but has many other diverse ideas for making neat keepsakes.  This isn't your typical memory/scrapbooking book -- not only is it full of new ideas, but it is heavy on the artistic, which makes it a welcome crafty read.	2004-03-16

The back of the jacket copy compels:  &quot;In the race of life, would you like to run in such a way as to get the prize?  Would you like to make the most of your talents?  Would you like to achieve your full potential?  Would you like to become the person  you were meant to be?&quot;<br />Who doesn't want to live up to their potential and become the person they were meant to be?<br />This book is written in a simple and engaging style, punctuated by illustrations drawn by the author and workbook-style pages to help the reader apply the principles discussed to his or her life.  Refreshingly, the points in the book are not endlessly repeated over and over in order to drill them into the reader's head, unlike many other motivational books.  This makes it more valuable than a comparable book because it gives more information in a relatively short amount of book.<br />The most intriguing thing for me in this book was the simple premise.  Do I want to live up to my true potential?  Am I working toward whatever it is in my life that I am supposed to be working toward, or have I gotten detoured?  These questions are ones that anyone who is searching for a fulfilling life must ask.  This book serves as a reminder of these questions, and gives a jumping off point for pursuing the answers.	2003-12-20

The focus of this book is creativity in photography for people who haven't done a lot of picture-taking.  In addition to showcasing some simple concepts, this book gives creative ideas and suggestions for all kinds of challenging photography situations (birthday parties, family meetings, the list goes on).  Kelsh's emphasis is on simplicity and ingenuity, and is guaranteed to transform your ho-hum snapshots into enlargement-worthy favorites.<br />This book has a few simple concepts that will revolutionize the way you take pictures (as well as the way you look at people). What could be simpler than the tips found in this book? We can all get closer, turn off the flash, take a lot of pictures (a few rolls at a time), and look at situations from unexpected perspectives. And yet, with just these basic tips, Nick Kelsh assures us that we will begin to take photos that will be treasured as instant classics.<br />Kelsh's tone is encouraging, conversational, and assuring. He is part-professional, part-everyphotographer. He is equally comfortable with portrait photography and snapshots. He avoids technical jargon and sticks with phrases we all like to imagine in connection with our own photos: \\"the envy of all your friends,\\" \\"compliments on your photos,\\" \\"people will ask you to photograph their children,\\" and so on.<br />You'll love your first reading of it, and I bet it will become a favorite over time. I'm tempted to buy several copies to give to friends. So don't wait -- get it, read it, and start taking pictures of your loved ones! And check out ALL of Nick Kelsh's titles!	2003-09-08

The book is organized into three sections (each section was originally its own book), that each cover two years of the newsletter's run, as well as some extra bits here and there.  The structure is loose - reading like a huge stack of back issues of the newsletter, and includes feature stories, editorial-style comments, and letters and tips from readers.<br />The author's tone is friendly, practical, and logical, and the book goes far beyond simple tips for living a frugal life.  In fact, Dacyczyn extols the merits of living life on your own terms, instead of on society's terms, using frugality as a vehicle to get fulfillment out of life.  On the way, she dishes out some sound suggestions for things like quality of living, child-rearing, and of course, tons and tons of demonstrations of HOW to cut costs in your own life.<br />I was amazed at how detailed some of Dacyczyn's comparisons and plans were - some demonstrating how you could save a few pennies (they add up), or some larger and more dramatic strategies for saving a lot more money.  Through all, Dacyczyn's committment to complete ethics within the framework of frugality (never practice frugality at the expense of others) is emphasized.<br />Although reading the entire book in a few sittings may feel a bit overwhelming (it is six years' worth of info, after all), there are some core strategies that are very worth the price of the book.  If nothing else, this book will cause you to evaluate how you spend your money, what you spend it on, and what you could be using it for, as well as perhaps motivate you to tighten up your budget a little (or a lot).<br />This book is highly entertaining, very inspiring, and extremely motivational.  And although I am making it sound rather theoretical, the book is actually mostly hands-on and practical.<br />Frugality is an extreme art, but one that has afforded many people with the means to truly live and enjoy life the way they choose to.  Both the book and the lifestyle are definitely worth taking a look at.me art, but one that has afforded many people with the means to truly live and enjoy life the way they choose to.  Both the book and the lifestyle are definitely worth taking a look at.	2002-04-23

Most &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; documentaries and interviews end up being thinly-disguised promotional trailers for movies.  Luckily, filmmaker Stephen Lowenstein interviewed 20 filmmakers of various origin, style, and age to bring us this collection of interviews about the experience of making a first film.<br />Each interview is different, just as each filmmaker's first moviemaking experience was different.  Every interview is illuminating and serves to broaden the reader's view of filmmaking, as well as increase appreciation for the sheer hard work and endurance required to get a movie to the point of completion.<br />I found myself riveted by each director's account of their first movies, of the experience of getting the film to the point of being made, to the casting, to the pre-production, to the first day of filming, to editing and then trying to find a place to screen the darn thing.  It was very interesting to get to know each filmmaker, the places they were in the beginning stages of their careers, and the places their films took them to.<br />I appreciated reading interviews with filmmakers I greatly admire (the Coen brothers), to those I am familiar with and jealous of (Kevin Smith), and especially the interviews with female filmmakers such as Allison Anders and Mira Nair (since I myself am female).  Some other interviews I particularly enjoyed: P.J. Hogan (&quot;Muriel's Wedding&quot;), James Mangold (&quot;Heavy&quot;), and Ang Lee (&quot;Pushing Hands&quot;).<br />If you like this book, I highly recommend &quot;Rebel Without a Crew&quot; by Robert Rodriguez, as it is a complete diary of the entire process of the making of his first feature film.	2002-04-06

We are all gifted with some type of hospitality, and if we don't feel rich in hospitality, there are ways to foster it within our lives.  All great.<br />The problem is, this book becomes repetitive and after a couple of chapters, I learned everything this book had to offer in terms of exploring the topic.  Granted, there were a few more charming vignettes to be read, but the book became slightly tiresome as the few core principles were touched upon over and over.<br />Repetitive though it may be, this book does afford some inspiration and many good ideas.  It is infused with recipes and ideas to spark your own personal hospitality.  Worth reading, but perhaps not worth reading more than once.	2001-11-13

I read this book accidentally, like many of the other reviewers, after I found it on my shelf (I picked it up at a clearance sale a few months ago).  I was pleasantly surprised at Brazo's open journal and intelligent and humorous writing style.<br />This book is inspiring on many levels, as a journal from a worn-out mother of three to God, as the quest of a woman to sanctify her home as the dwelling place of not only her family, but of her savior, as the thirst of a person after God and pursuit of a way to worship him.  The list could go on.  I am inspired to make some changes in my household and also in my relationships with God and my family.<br />Great writing and a good book.  Highly recommended.	2001-11-13

It wasn't until I decided to read it again recently that I realized what a truly well-written book this is!  Honestly, this book is a lot closer to the quality of C.S. Lewis' &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; than I realized.  I would also compare this writing to many of Stephen Lawhead's works.<br />White's writing is solid, well-paced, and skillful, and his characters are decently well-developed.  He works the message of the gospel (as well as some solid Christian-living principles) in the story with a delicate touch, although at no point is the book preachy, dogmatic, or cheesy.<br />I was very happy with the quality of writing to be found in this book (NOT a common occurrence in christian fiction), and plan to read the rest of the series.	2001-11-13

Each person also &quot;speaks&quot; a primary love language, and responds strongly to one of the types of love-giving.  Chapman identifies these love languages as: physical touch, gifts, quality time, acts of service, and words of affirmation.  In order to best make someone feel loved, you must &quot;speak&quot; their primary love language to them.<br />In this book, Chapman is teamed up with best-selling author Ross Campbell, who has written some very successful books on relationships with children.  The premise of this book is that the love languages are not only applicable to the adults in your life, but to your children as well, and can in fact have a major effect on their behavior and happiness.<br />The book begins with a general discussion of love languages, some stories illustrating the dramatic difference that utilizing the knowledge of love languages has made in some parents' relationships with their children, and an overview of the book.  Chapman and Campbell then discuss each love language in a chapter of its own, complete with real-life examples of each love language in the lives of parents and children.<br />The book then launches into a discussion of discipline (do NOT use a form of discipline related to your child's love language, warn the authors), as well as a brief discussion of the effect that the love language theory can have on your adult relationships (for a more in-depth discussion, see Chapman's &quot;The Five Love Languages&quot;).  There is also quite a long discussion of &quot;passive agressiveness&quot; which I thought to be a bit overkill, but I'm sure is very important in the treatment of the topic (I have a feeling that this is co-author Ross Campbell's pet subject).<br />The information in this book is very powerful and has the potential to radically alter your relationships with your children, as well as anyone else in your life.  The testamonials are very convincing, and the fact that this book, as well as others in the &quot;Love Languages&quot; series have enjoyed such wild success is a testimony to their effectiveness.  My only complaint really was that some of the writing occasionally tended toward the cheesy side, and that often I was aware of the differences in the voices of the two authors.  These are unimportant complaints, however, and do not deter me from recommending the book highly!<br />This book would be useful reading for any parent, no matter the quality of relationships within the family, as well as anyone else who is dealing with children on a regular basis (teachers, grandparents, babysitters, etc.).ry powerful and has the potential to radically alter your relationships with your children, as well as anyone else in your life.

It's been weeks since I read this book, but it's still in my head. Does that mean I've been permanently changed? That's a pretty amazing feat for the diary of a filmmaker.<br />This book is the incredible tale (told in excerpts from Rodriguez's diary) of how Robert Rodriguez went from submitting film shorts to small-time film festivals to travelling to Hollywood, getting an agent, and finally winning an award at Sundance. (And you can see the epilogue of the book, as Rodriguez's most recent film, &quot;Spy Kids&quot; has almost reached $100 million domestically after only five weeks).<br />Since Rodriguez wrote his diary as his life was being radically altered, the reader really gets to make the journey with him from medical guinea pig to camera jockey to the most sought-after person in Hollywood... it's amazing.<br />The best part is that Rodriguez is also a teacher, and his book manages to be massively instructive as well as encouraging. Rodriguez gives practical advice about things like cameras, lighting, and films, as well as advice on more ephemeral topics, like staying true to yourself in filmmaking. Like a more-experienced older brother, Rodriguez tells us how to deal with the junk that Hollywood metes out, and how to emerge personality intact.<br />It's clear that Rodriguez is emerging as a Hollywood maverick and leader, much like other indie-turned-studio directors such as Steven Soderbergh (&quot;Sex, Lies and Videotape,&quot; &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; and &quot;Traffic&quot;), and this book is a veritable how-to manual. A roadmap to filmmaking, if you will.<br />Yes, it's a must-read if you are a filmmaker (&quot;So you want to be a filmmaker?&quot; asks Rodriguez. &quot;First step to being a filmmaker is to stop saying you want to be a filmmaker... you don't want to be a filmmaker, you ARE a filmmaker.&quot;) But if you love stories of excruciating hard work mingled with blood and sweat, David taking on Goliath, and a super-big payoff ending, then this is a story you won't want to miss.<br />When's your next diary coming out, Robert?ingled with blood and sweat, David taking on Goliath, and a super-big payoff ending, then this is a story you won't want to miss.<br />When's your next diary coming out, Robert?	2001-05-05

I learned more in Goldman's book than in most of those other books put together, and it was so wildly interesting and entertaining that I couldn't tear myself away.<br />Goldman is alternately self-congratulatory and self deprecating, proud and humble, excited and blase.  His prose reflects his love for telling a good story with good reversals, and his screenwriting technique becomes apparent throughout the book.  What also becomes apparent is Goldman's genius, and the precarious balance between success and selling out inherent in the screenwriting trade.<br />I learned about filmmaking in a way I never have, and got the opinion and perspective of a true veteran in the field.  And, this book is a great read by a gifted author!<br />This book contains a general history of Goldman in Hollywood, as well as a rundown of all his scripts and the experiences he had writing them and seeing them come into maturity as films (or not).  It also contains the full screenplay for &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; as well as a screenplay written from one of Goldman's old short stories which is especially interesting because it comes with critiques from an art director, editor, cameraperson, and director.  Intertwined within this framework is Goldman's philosophy on writing as well as dozens of lessons on how to improve as a writer.<br />I enjoyed this book greatly, and look forward to reading his follow-up to it, &quot;Which Lies Did I Tell.&quot;  Without a doubt, this book is required reading for ANYONE who wishes to be a screenwriter, and probably also for anyone who is remotely interested in Hollywood and the movies.	2001-03-04

I would think that the title would more prominently announce something about bookmaking, and not use the word scrapbook (since these days, scrapbooking has grown in popularity, and is a completely different hobby).<br />That said, this book is an excellent introduction work to bookbinding.  It has instructions on many different types of book bindings (from simple to more challenging), as well as much info on decorations for your book covers (marbling, quilling, and more).

In the grand tradition of Reader's Digest, this book distills several sweeping topics into small bites -- just the highlights.  It begins with a section on cooking (canning, preserving, condiments, desserts, and a sumptuously generous section on ice cream!).<br />The book then forays into projects for &quot;around the home&quot; offering a crash course in design/decorating for your home as well as useful techniques to use in decorating your home. Selected projects involve decorative techniques for painting walls, refinishing furniture (&quot;reviving&quot;) with paint, window treatments, making decorative touches such as throw pillows and braided rugs, and many more.  This chapter emphasizes using existing pieces of furniture, revamping them to give them a new look, while not costing a great deal of money.  Some of the projects are simple, and some are more advanced, but the book takes you through each one step by step.  Also included in this chapter is a very useful section on natural cleaners with recipes for more than thirty household cleaners.<br />We then move into the beauty and body-care section, in which many more recipes for bath and body products are given.  Most of these use easily attainable ingredients, however, most will only last a short period of time and must be whipped up every time you wish to use one.  Examples of recipes: hand cream, herbal deodorant, summer body splash, soaps, cold cream, lip gloss, face masks, toothpaste, men's cologne &amp; aftershave, shampoos, perfumes, and natural home remedies.<br />Pets and wildlife receive treatment in the next chapter, which showcases projects that benefit our animal friends.  Think dog houses &amp; beds, coats, cat seats &amp; perches, fancy collars, birdhouses &amp; birdbaths, as well as butterfly and bat houses.  The next chapter continues in the same vein with yard and garden projects.  Instructions abound for gardens: kitchen, herb, raised bed, even the home orchard.  Other more unusual topics are addressed, with the section on topiary, ponds, paths and edgings, compost, and garden trimmings (lanterns, homemade pots, repainted pots &amp; pot stands).<br />The last chapter is a general crafts section, with instructions on making stamps, quilting, sewing, knitting, drying &amp; arranging flowers, basket-making, and many other techniques.  The book also includes short sections on decorating for Christmas, gift card making, and gift wrapping.<br />All-in-all, this is a great survey book, and will give a reader enough to pique his/her interest in many different areas.

The reader is encouraged to try drawing, and to enjoy what comes out of the pencil/pen!  Blake's writing is as humorous as his drawings, and not disappointingly, his drawings linger near the edges of each page beckoning you to draw companions for them.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone too embarrassed about her stick figures to ever draw one in public, but who secretly cherishes a desire to doodle with style.	2001-02-25

Not so with this book -- it more than delivered on the promise made by the title and description.  What a book!<br />I was struck in the first few pages at the encouraging tone of the book, and then again by the heft of the authors' intellects -- wow, these women have brains!  But brains aren't all they have.  They've got plenty of common sense about filmmaking with which they have been more than generous in their book.  I learned more about filmmaking than I have from reading any other book, and at the same time I was energized and ready to pick up a camera, instead of discouraged and ready to run far away from any dreams of filmmaking.<br />It may be too late to go to film school, but it's never too late to read this book and get the down-low on everything you could want to know about making a film, conceptually, practically, and realistically.  I'll have to read this book a few more times, and keep it close at hand for reference.<br />Well done, Camille and Tiare.	2001-02-17

Also, Grisham was very careful not to moralize in this book, and it shows.<br />In &quot;The Brethren,&quot; we follow two seemingly separate stories until they meet (rather predictably) somewhere in the middle.  The moments of excitement are fewer than in previous novels, and the excitement is lower.  The problems are resolved relatively easy, and there really isn't much conflict in the book.  However, the book is interesting for the most part, and decidedly more entertaining than Grisham's last two novels.<br />Fans of Grisham's early novels will appreciate that this one is closer in makeup to some of his earlier books, such as &quot;The Firm,&quot; and &quot;The Pelican Brief.&quot;  While this book is reminiscent of vintage Grisham, there is evidence that he is growing as an author, and this story seems a little more mature than earlier books.<br />All that to say that this book was entertaining and solid, and a must for any Grisham fans.	2001-02-07

Good info that works (as evidenced by the fact that the authors consulted with professionals in each area).  And how could you not want to own a book that tells you &quot;How to deliver a baby in the back seat of a car&quot; or &quot;How to survive a landing when your parachute won't open&quot;?

I only wish the book had even more ideas, but perhaps that is another book!<br />If you are a teacher who wants to teach art, but doesn't know much about it, and doesn't know where to begin, I suggest beginning with this book.  It's a crash course not only in art, but in teaching art to elementary students and instilling a love of art within your students.	2000-12-16

Don't be fooled by the title -- ­&quot;The Non-Designer's Design Book&quot; is a serious book that can be useful to anyone.  In a slim volume, this book distills to the very essence principles that seasoned design professionals use.  This is NOT Design for Dummies, it's Design-for-Wannabe-Designers, and it's not kidding.<br />Writer Robin Williams delivers a powerful design seminar in fun-book disguise.  Her tone is light, encouraging, and creative, and her information is killer.  I've read many books on this subject, and I learned many things in &quot;The Non-Designer's Design Book&quot; that have never even been approached in other books.<br />Williams begins with the basics, using examples and redesigns to illustrate design principles that will teach you how to make an effective newsletter, brochure, business card, or advertisement every time.  She then moves into more complicated subjects such as typography (no kidding ­-- I've never read anything about typography in any other book) that will serve to further refine your design projects.<br />This book is not for the casual reader -- it is guaranteed to revolutionize the way you see, think about, and design any print media.  Williams has written a clever, incisive lesson on design, while managing to be entertaining and encouraging.  This book should undoubtably be a part of your complete designing education!	2000-12-16

The reader doesn't have to sift through the excruciating snobby details, but instead is given the real lowdown as if visiting with a best friend who happens to be a costume mistress.<br />This book focuses mainly on costuming for low-budget productions (such as community theatre or a school play), providing useful information and advice on making good-looking costumes from already existing garments and/or thrift store offerings.  Information abounds about time period, costume cuts &amp; styles, ways to splurge or skimp on your costumes and still have them look fabulous, as well as details that an inexperienced costumer might overlook (such as using velcro instead of buttons for ease in costume changes).<br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who is involved in costuming for a production, or anyone who simply loves costumes and loves to recycle old clothes into great new ones.  I love this book and have read through it several times just for inspiration.	2000-12-01

It's also perfect for pastors who want to teach on spiritual gifting, and also encourage church members to exercise their spiritual gifts with benefit to the church.<br />Wagner's writing is succinct, humorous, and clear.  This book sheds light not only on different spiritual gifts, but theories surrounding them (the book draws from several lists in the Bible, none of which completely mention every spiritual gift), common misconceptions, as well as a test in the back of the book to help each person begin to get a sense of what his or her spiritual gifts might be.<br />The book is geared toward using spiritual gifts to help the church grow, and therefore focuses on some spiritual gifts more than others (to my disappointment, the ones barely touched upon seemed more relevant to me than the ones greatly expounded upon -- ah well, another book perhaps).  I appreciated Wagner's candor and openness to other scholar's theories about spiritual giftings, as well as his standpoints on misuses of spiritual gifts.<br />This book is highly recommended as a place to begin your studies on spiritual giftings, especially in the context of gifts within the church body.	2000-11-12

Taback's collage pictures include brightly  colored paintings with snippets of newspapers and other interesting  materials, and Taback incorporates clever die-cut holes which add to the  visual hilarity.  My husband said that the illustrations in this book  looked like &quot;Mary Engelbreit gone evil.&quot;<br />The poem is the old  familiar American classic, but Taback adds some original elements by  allowing the animal characters to comment on the poem as it goes along, all  the way to the shocking conclusion.  Children will enjoy the colorful  pictures and the poem, and adults will enjoy Taback's wry sense of  humor.<br />This book was a Caldecott Honor book, but I think it deserved to  win the Caldecott Medal.

I found the clothing to be slightly  matronly and not exactly pret-a-porte, but perhaps that's because I'm  younger than the target audience (women 30+).<br />What this book does right:  give you a basic understanding of a basic wardrobe and how to shop  intelligently to put together a good closet of basics;  a checklist of  must-have items (or at least items to think about owning);  a basic  understanding of higher fashion and why/when it's useful to own some more  expensive pieces of clothing; great photos (of not-necessarily-great  outfits).<br />I enjoyed the tone of the book, intelligent and sassy, like an  older more-fashionable friend.  I also enjoyed a section that gave a  general picture of how fashion plays out in different regions, just for the  social science buff in me.<br />I wouldn't make this book your fashion bible,  but if you are fashionably clueless, it's a good place to start.	2000-09-20

Zelinsky's &quot;Rapunzel&quot; is a delight of renaissance-like oil paintings depicting a delicately beautiful girl, a frightening witch,  and a handsome prince.  The illustrations are truly superb, and each page  features a beautifully rendered painting rich with color and  detail.<br />Zelinsky's retelling of the story is traditional yet satisfying,  but the illustrations really steal the show.  Children will get caught up  in the fairytale landscapes and the magical locales.  Readers will also  appreciate the additional information provided by Zelinsky about his  retelling of the story and his study of Italian Renaissance art.  It's  always nice to know why artists choose to illustrate stories in a certain  way.<br />This book won the Caldecott Medal for its fantastic illustrations.	2000-09-20

Viki King's Inner Movie Method gives small enough building blocks that  writing a screenplay becomes possible, even though doing it in 21 days  seems like such a difficult goal.  King helps the writer define the movie's  essence and then begin writing.<br />King stresses that the writer's first  draft should be from the heart, and then subsequent rewrites and editing  sessions should be conducted from the head.  This frees the writer up to  just write and think about the movie after something is on the page.<br />I'd  recommend this book to anyone who gets intimidated just thinking about  writing, to anyone who hasn't managed to write a screenplay yet but has a  burning desire to do so, and anyone who needs some motivation or has  writer's block.	2000-09-20

Peggy Parish uses these limitations to her  benefit, however, creating a whimsical character in Amelia Bedelia, a woman  who takes everything literally (for example, a request to prune the hedges  causes Amelia to stick prunes on the hedges, and when asked to draw the  drapes in the living room, Amelia scrambles for her pencil and notepad to  sketch them).<br />Amelia Bedelia's peculiarities make for a memorable story  -- one that kids will read over and over, and one that parents won't mind  sitting in on.  This book is highly recommended.  (Okay, okay, I loved it  when I was a kid!)<br />And hey, be sure to catch all the other Amelia Bedelia  books as well.	2000-09-07

In fact, MATILDA is probably the predecessor to Harry Potter, and  deserving of as much praise and admiration.<br />Matilda is a girl who doesn't  jibe with her parents, is despised by the school principal, Ms. Trunchbowl,  and has a wonderfully sweet teacher named Miss Honey.  Oh, and Matilda just  happens to have special powers.  This book follows Matilda in her search  for friendship, approval, and the key to her magical powers.<br />The tone  in this book is whimsical and magical, with a huge helping of humor and  outrageousness.  The characters are strong and entertaining, and the story  is engaging.  This book is a must read for fans of Roald Dahl's other  books, specifically CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, as well as fans of  J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.  Highly recommended!	2000-09-07

I read this book for the second time several weeks ago in anticipation of Book 4.  I was every bit as pleased and entertained (perhaps a bit more) as  I was the first time around.  These books have earned a place of honor on  my most-loved book shelf.<br />&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of  Secrets&quot; is the second in the series following Harry Potter at  Hogwart's school of wizardry. In this book, we are served ample portions of  our favorite characters and introduced to some new ones, most notably,  Gilderoy Lockheart, the new celebrity professor of Defense Against the Dark  Arts.  We learn some new things about Harry and the mystery surrounding  Vold... You-know-who.<br />This book is full of twists and turns, unexpected  surprises, enemies you love to hate, and wonderfully entertaining  fantasy.<br />I would recommend this book to ANYONE (any age) who enjoys the  writings of Roald Dahl, C.S. Lewis, Madeleine L'Engle, or J.R.R. Tolkien.  This is a very fun, humourous, and enjoyable fantasy novel, and one that  should be read more than once!	2000-08-23

Rowling was very liberal with her writing in this installment of the Harry Potter series.  At over 700 pages, this book is a heavyweight!  HARRY  POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE has a different feel than its predecessors --  a bit darker, quite a bit longer (with no detail left out), and a bit more  mature.  Harry is definitely getting older, and it shows in this book.<br />In  Harry Potter IV, the story gets deeper, the plot thickens, and the evil is  more serious.  We learn a great deal about many things in Potter's world,  and we get to know some favorite characters even better.  Of course, there  are a few new characters, most notably the new Defense Against the Dark  Arts teacher Mad-Eye Moody, who is one of the best characters to date in  this series.<br />Readers of the first three books have no choice but to read  this book, and they won't be disappointed!  Rowling serves up a hungry-man  portion of mystery, magic, fantasy, and fun in this hefty novel.<br />If you  still haven't read the first three books, read them right away, and then  tuck into the new book!  If you enjoy the readings of Roald Dahl, C.S.  Lewis, or Madeleine L'engle, the Harry Potter series is a MUST READ.	2000-08-23

If our love tanks are  full, we are happy, fulfilled, and have a positive view of our  marriages/spouses.  If our love tanks are not full, we feel empty, unhappy,  and have a less positive view of our marriages and spouses.  Each of us has  a primary &quot;language&quot; of love, which we both speak when we give  love, and in which we expect to receive love.  The five languages are:  Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Acts of Service, Gift Giving, and  Physical Touch.<br />The theory behind these five love languages is, in order  to completely fill your spouse's love tank, you need to figure out which  language they respond to most, and then begin expressing love to them in  that way, even if it isn't your natural inclination to express love that  way.  When you do this, they will automatically feel much more loved, and  they will reciprocate, thus, your marriage will stay much more fulfilling,  and you will be able to share love much more effectively.<br />Chapman's  theory has been proven by hundreds of couples to be a valid one, and the  book almost reads like a &quot;Get Rich Quick&quot; pamphlet for Love.  However, according to Chapman (and all the positive reviews for this book),  this theory really works, and can &quot;radically change your  marriage.&quot;<br />Five stars!	2000-08-12

This book is punctuated by quotes from celebrities, as  well as fashion-designer drawings.<br />Feldon maintains that even if we  don't want to be judged by appearance, the fact is that we are.  Instead of  worrying about changing ourselves, Leah gives us what she has dubbed  &quot;Camoflage Chic&quot; -- looking good while minimizing flaws.  This is  the basic premise of most &quot;art of dressing&quot; books, but Feldon's  engaging style make it an easy and encouraging read.	2000-08-09

I  was hoping for &quot;Natalie Goldberg meets Writer's Digest,&quot; in other  words, the inspiration of Goldberg with the practicality of the magazine.  Unfortunately, I found the book to be dry and uninspiring.<br />This book  was written in a semi-engaging matter, but most of the chapters are nothing  new, and didn't have the spark of many other writing books I've read.  For  a good writing experience, read Natalie Goldberg's &quot;Writing Down the  Bones,&quot; but skip HOW TO WRITE WITH THE SKILL OF A MASTER AND THE  GENIUS OF A CHILD.<br />Well, you can read the title again a few times, if  you want.	2000-08-07

Margaux Tartarotti, a teacher and fashion designer,  applies the standard body-type shapes (hourglass, pear shape, etc.) and  gives them all names based on the women portrayed by certain artists.  For  instance, the pear shape becomes the Modigliani, and the hourglass becomes  the Pop-Art (think Warhol's Marilyn Monroe).  Not only does this add  sensuousness to the body type, but it makes each woman feel like her  body-type is one to be admired, no matter what shape it takes.<br />Building  off these six body types, the author gives a great deal of good advice, and  several core outfits that accentuate the positives of each body type, while  minimizing the weaknesses.  Each body type is accompanied by many beautiful  fashion-designer illustrations, including pictures that list what NOT to  wear for your body type.  In addition to information for specific body  types, much general information is provided in regards to color, fabric,  and ways to look your best.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone  who wants to look elegant, sophisticated, and put-together.  This is real  information from someone who has made it her life's work to make women look  beautiful, and who has taken notes from artists who portray beautiful women  who are not limited to today's narrow definition of beauty.	2000-08-04

The fourth of the Left Behind series, this book combines the catastrophes of  Revelation with some action, intrigue, and even some really interesting  minor characters.<br />The major characters are finally presented with some  real problems (other than the major problem of being left behind), some  real struggles, some real disappointments, and some new friends.  This book  introduces us to the excellent characters of Ken Ritz, maverick charter  pilot, and Mac McCallum, co-pilot on the Antichrist's personal jet, and a  few others.<br />The story is consistently interesting in this book, and the  outcomes of all the situations are not predictable.

Second in the series, this book plods along at a slow pace, and subjects us to  interminable pages of the &quot;Should I call, or should I not call?&quot;  that begins to characterize the relationship between Buck and Chloe.  For  some reason, the authors decided that the story of the Tribulation Force --  a group of four ultra-saints -- would be an interesting one.  Granted,  &quot;Tribulation Force&quot; is a great title for a book, and it seems  like it will be a really exciting concept.  When I found out that the  Tribulation Force was just an exclusive Bible study that didn't really have  any defined goals, I was disappointed.<br />The last two chapters of this  book are crammed with interesting news told in summary.  I wish the authors  would have allowed all this interesting stuff to permeate the rest of the  book, instead of simply summarizing at the end.  Perhaps if the authors had  chosen to use more of this in the story, and less of the back-and-forth of  relationships and some agonizingly long internalizations, this book would  have been stronger.  Another major faux pas was the appearance of Amanda,  Rayford Steele's fiancee in the last two chapters.  She randomly appeared  and married Rayford abruptly without even allowing the readers to meet her  before this happened.  This bitterly disappointed me, and I consider it a  poor storytelling technique.<br />Perhaps this book was written to further  define the characters for the rest of the lengthy series, but  unfortunately, that isn't enough to make this book stand.<br />The good news  is, the series gets more interesting.  I recommend this book, if only as a  vehicle to the rest of the series, which gets decidedly more interesting  with the third book, NICOLAE.	2000-08-03

The photos are good, and like the author says, not retouched, which is encouraging.  Before and after pictures are shown, and the models  are not all of the Cosmo-cover variety (but they do all look beautiful in  the &quot;after&quot; stage).<br />DeMann's style is very engaging, and her  prose is levelheaded as well as observant.  Her tips are factual and  helpful, and this book is clearly not designed to give anyone an  inferiority complex but instead, to help build self-esteem while teaching  to enhance your natural assets.<br />The information in this book could not  possibly be outdated because DeMann's core philosophy is that the person  and not the makeup should be the focus.  Therefore, most of the tips in the  book are aimed at the natural look, which can never be outdated.<br />Bottom  line: useful book written in an engaging style with many attractive photos.

The two main characters are male, and the only female  characters are secondary, which I was slightly bothered by.  However,  despite the simplicity of the storyline, the book is interesting because  the events of Revelation are placed so seamlessly in today's society.  I  believe this is where the strength of this book lies: in causing readers to  imagine themselves in the place of the characters.<br />Much of the story is  told in the forms of internal conflict, and actual dialog is less than  abundant.  Some of the issues are repetitive, and some of the phrases in  the book are used copiously (&quot;just a few short weeks ago, so-and-so  would never have considered this a possibility&quot;).  However, I enjoyed  the book, and it is easy to see why this subject matter would capture the  attention of so many people.

Harry's got a new fame-hungry professor to dodge, Quidditch matches to win, friends to protect, and mysteries to solve.  The story unfolds at a rapid pace, and the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets is intriguing.<br />In the Harry Potter books, Rowling has created a fantastic world of magic in the vein of C.S.

Any fans of fantasy should be sure to read the Harry Potter books, as they hold their own alongside these classics.	2000-07-06

THE OATH was a new  experience for me: Christian Horror.<br />This book unfolds slowly and  suspensefully as the main character tries to investigate his brother's  violent death.  Step by step the story grows more fantastic, and results in  a battle-to-the-death between good and evil.  The metaphorical nature of  some of the situations is intriguing, and I liked the way the author worked  in concepts such as sin, repentance, hypocrisy, and salvation.<br />I wasn't  as impressed by this book as I have been by other Peretti books, and I  honestly never got scared.  However, I am still pleased that Peretti  doesn't allow himself to be caged in by what some Christians may deem  &quot;inappropriate.&quot;<br />Christian Horror is a very small genre  indeed (perhaps only one or two of Peretti's books make up the whole of the  genre?), but I think it is something to be explored.  Peretti's THE OATH  was a good beginning.	2000-07-06

I read it my first semester in a Christian college, and I had to lock myself in my room for 3 days after I finished it because it had so affected my  life, I couldn't deal with anything else.<br />This book deals with art, fear,  gifts from God, human condemnation, family relations and constraints, and  reconciliation of creative gifts to God. It affected me deeply because I am  a devoted Christian and have had to deal with the effects of religious (not  necessarily Godly) opinions about creative gifts, and have had to weigh my  gifts in the context of my religion.<br />Chaim Potok's writing is beautiful  and evocative, and his story is intricate and important.  MY NAME IS ASHER  LEV deals delicately with issues of personal creativity vs. religion, and  ends stunningly.  If you have read Potok, this book should be the next on  your list.

PIERCING THE DARKNESS is a spiritual thriller telling the story of the sleepy town of Bacon's Corner,  and the sinister things going on just below the surface.<br />This novel was  suspenseful, well-written, and inspiring but not saccharine.  Peretti has a  gift for writing about Christian topics without getting too preachy or  formulaic, and this book had a good balance of imagination and Bible-based  truth.  This book holds its own alongside such popular authors as John  Grisham and Michael Crichton, but also delivers a valuable perspective on  Christian life: the interaction between the physical and spiritual realms.  This book is entertaining, but beyond that, it is thought-provoking.<br />I  would highly recommend this book, as Frank Peretti is probably the most  talented christian author of fiction I've read.  However, if you haven't  read THIS PRESENT DARKNESS, I would recommend starting there first.	2000-06-26

Peretti that I have ever read.  Previously, I avoided Peretti's work because I just wasn't sure that Christian fiction could be worth my time.  I was sorely  wrong, and I'm glad to admit it.  THE VISITATION was a very well-written  novel, by Christian OR by secular standards.<br />THE VISITATION is about an  ex-pastor and his grapple with issues of faith and God's faithfulness, his  search for the truth surrounding some strange events that occur in his  town, and his discovery of a Jesus-like man who suddenly arrives on the  scene.<br />THE VISITATION is a suspenseful thriller written in a well-timed  manner.  The characters are varied and interesting, and the story is  multi-layered and complex.  Frank Peretti's writing is honest -- he writes  about humanity in all its imperfection and sinfulness; he doesn't skirt  around delicate issues, and he never takes the easy or cliche Christian way  out.<br />I would highly recommend this book, and any other Frank Peretti  book.  I am consistently impressed with his honesty and his skillfully  written spiritual thrillers, and THE VISITATION is no exception.	2000-06-26

It glossed over some traumatic moments in Laura's life,  and made her look like a perfect person instead of a normal person with  some faults.<br />This book is designed to fit in with the current LITTLE  HOUSE paperback design, which is handy.  It is an easy read (written for  the 9-12 set), but will interest those who want to know more about  &quot;the real Laura.&quot;  I would recommend it over the other  biographies I have read about Laura Ingalls Wilder because it is written to  be interesting, not to be historically detailed.

Because it is an academic book, written for the history-buff crowd, it's somewhat dry.  There is a great deal of information to be read here, however, and you will  feel that you know &quot;the real Laura Ingalls&quot; after you read this  book.<br />The author is an expert on Laura Ingalls Wilder, and spent a huge  amount of time in research for this book.  He basically recounts as much as  he can of Laura's life, based on written accounts of her, and on her own  writings.  Much of his book also deals with a dominant person in Laura's  life: her daughter Rose.  The book also features quite a few photos of  Laura and her family.<br />Die-hard fans of Laura should read this book only  if they are ready for more than 250 pages of history.  It's not a novel, it  doesn't contain a lot of color, but it is worth reading if you really want  to know every detail about Laura's life.	2000-06-15

The dialog is snappy (my husband said it reminds him of CATCH-22), and the characters are entertaining.  The book clips along at a brisk pace,  and so many things are happening that it's impossible to get bored.<br />Basic  plot: A group of people are gathered together at the mansion of a deceased  tycoon and are divided into groups, given sporadic clues, with the  opportunity to win a great deal of money if they can find out who killed  Sam Westing.<br />The book is a madcap adventure, a stunning mystery (with  plenty of clues and red herrings), and a wildly entertaining comedy.  One  feature that I especially liked was that the author included what happened  when everyone &quot;lived happily ever after.&quot;<br />I would recommend  this book to: any kid who wants to be entertained, any parent who wants to  interest her child in reading, any person who likes quality children's  literature.	2000-06-15

It's a great supplement to her  LITTLE HOUSE books, and is comprehensive enough to give a lot of extra  information to those who are interested in Laura's &quot;real life.&quot;	2000-06-15

Lewis (THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE), and Madeleine L'Engle (A WRINKLE IN TIME).  Simply put, this  book is a classic and a masterpiece of children's fantasy.<br />This book  introduces us to Harry Potter, who lives with his nasty relatives the  Dursleys.  His life changes one day when he receives a letter from  Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry -- he's not normal, he's a  Wizard!  From there we are introduced to myriad kooky and endearing  characters: friends Ron and Hermione, big buddy Hagrid, professors  Dumbledore and McGonagall, enemies Snape, Draco, and Vol...  You-Know-Who.<br />J.K. Rowling has masterfully rendered a captivating  page-turner.  This book includes everything one could wish in a fantasy:  interesting characters, a strong tension between good and evil, plenty of  mystery, dramatic twists-and-turns, and a bit of magic.<br />This book is a  must-read for kids and adults alike.  It's imaginative, clever, and a good  read.	2000-06-15

Rowley and Rosenzweig, divas of Swell, give inside tips enough to  fill any girl's four-inch purse.<br />This book has a lot of common sense a la  Vogue's Book of Ettiquette 1948, but dishes tips out like a hopped-up  store-bought Sara Lee pound cake: recycled-but-transformed, a little  irreverant, smart, and simply brilliant.  Of course, any book designed to  make you into that person you've always wanted to be is a more than  ambitious.  I personally feel like a failure whenever I crack the pages of  a fashion mag and therefore avoid them at all costs.  However, the  redeeming mantra of SWELL is that a girl can be herself and still be  fabulous.<br />I'd recommend this book for anyone who digs the glamour of  classic movies, envies the life of the party, and is ready to buy into the  belief that anyone can be Swell with just a little preparation and a lot of  fun.	2000-06-15
US	51662675	RF3VPKQDVATGY	0891073906	145017176	This Present Darkness	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Something rotten in the town of Ashton	THIS PRESENT DARKNESS is the story of something sinister in the town of Ashton, and two men who are concerned enough to find out more about it.  This book is an account of what happens on two levels, the physical and the  spiritual, the battles that take place in both realms, and the dependence  each realm has on the other.<br />Frank Peretti weaves an intricate web of  characters, intrigue, and tension in this spiritual thriller.  I was  reminded of John Grisham's THE FIRM in terms of the numerous characters,  the sheer number of problems and situations that arise, the insidious  nature of the enemies, and the severe tension in this book.  This book was  packed with action, nevertheless information necessary to solve the  ever-widening puzzle was doled out very slowly and only as necessary; there  were many twists and turns of plot, and the spiritual aspect of the book  was downright intriguing.<br />Through all, Peretti manages to convey to the  reader the vast importance of the spiritual realm beyond the scope of the  book.  Entertaining, yes.  Eye-opening, even more so.	2000-06-15

AN INCOMPLETE EDUCATION is truly a wonderful supplement to any person's knowledge.<br />This book is basically an intellectual history overview with a  lot of helpful charts and guides.  It's written in a very humorous tone,  and it hits the humor target more often than not.  If you feel that you  lack knowledge, this is the book for you.  It's not in depth, but it does  tell you what you SHOULD know in all areas, including history, philosophy,  music, art, and even film.  My personal favorite features are the Latin  abbreviations and the &quot;Words you pronounce wrong but if you pronounced  them right, you'd be considered a pretentious snob&quot; feature.<br />For a  good time (and to increase your IQ), read this book.  It's tongue-in-cheek,  but it's a wealth of information.	2000-06-13

His writing is enjoyable and the common language used really lets the reader see the text in the light that it was written  in.<br />The back of the book jacket says that the Bible was not written in  scholarly Greek, but in a common, conversational tone -- in the language of  the streets and the marketplace.  The way The Message was written makes the  New Testament infinitely more accessible.<br />I believe Eugene Peterson _did_  translate directly from the Greek, and not from another English translation  of the New Testament, therefore, I think this translation rings very true  to the original text.  (I'm not a Bible scholar, however).<br />One  characteristic that occasionally bothers me is the overabundance of idioms  -- English cliches.  Phrases like &quot;you can't see the forest for the  trees&quot; distract rather than inspire me.  It should also be noted that  verses are not numbered, as in traditional translations, although the  chapters are designated.  This isn't a complaint, but an interesting  feature.<br />I highly recommend THE MESSAGE -- it's a revolutionary way to  read the Bible.  You can read it on its own, or with another translation of  the Bible as a companion.  If you know someone who is having trouble  &quot;getting into the Word,&quot; then definitely let them know about The  Message.	2000-06-13

Conveniently pocket-sized, THE BAD GIRL'S GUIDE TO THE OPEN  ROAD is a must-have for any woman who's on-the-go.<br />Punctuated by  hilarious drawings, this little book contains big tips, fashion tips, ways  to stay law-abiding, and even trivia.  This book pointedly teaches you how  to &quot;get in touch with your badness&quot; and manages to be wildly  entertaining in the process.<br />Highly recommended if a.)your secret heroes  are Thelma and Louise; b.)you feel the need for speed; c.)you are tired of  playing 20 questions and the license plate game; and/or d.)you're ready to  take to the open road.	2000-06-13

From starting the band to booking shows to getting signed, this book basically covers it all.<br />I found many useful features  in this book, including the layout (spaced-out paragraphs with Bold  headlines), the samples (press releases, logos, you name it), and the scope  of information (basic to more advanced).  The tone is conversational, as if  you have a pal who's letting you in on the inside scoop of the music  business.  The typos did bug me, though -- didn't someone copy-edit this  book before it went to press?<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants  to learn more about the music business.  It's a great place to start, and  provides a lot of useful information.	2000-06-13

What I was struck with, again, is the sheer imaginative nature of J.K. Rowling's books.  Simply put, these books are instant  classics.<br />&quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; is the  third in the series following Harry Potter at Hogwart's school of wizardry.  Harry is now a 13-year old (his birthday occurring at the beginning of the  book), and concerned mostly with classes, Quidditch (a wizard sport), and  the fact that he's not allowed to visit the local wizard village of  Hogsmeade with his friends on the weekends.  One of the reasons for this is  that Sirius Black, a convicted murderer, has broken out of Azkaban, the  wizard prison, and word has it that he's out to get Harry.<br />In keeping  with Harry Potter tradition, the reader can expect surprises, twists and  turns, malicious rivals, uncommonly kind professors, terrible relatives,  amazing magic candy, true friendships, and a whiz-bang ending.<br />It's  delightful to see how Rowling can stay true to the feel of the previous  books, and yet allow Harry and friends to mature.  This book is a little  longer than the previous books, but the imagination never lets up, and  gradually Harry's world is widening.<br />I would recommend this book to  ANYONE (any age) who enjoys the writings of Roald Dahl, C.S. Lewis,  Madeleine L'Engle, or J.R.R. Tolkien.  This is a very fun, humourous, and  enjoyable fantasy novel, and one that should be read more than once!	2000-06-12

However, once I opened this book, I knew I needed to place it in a very prized position on my reference shelf.<br />Not only are the graded word lists extremely helpful, but the short profile of each age group combined with the description of what publishers are looking for at each reading level makes for a powerful advantage when writing for children.<br />This book is a must-have if you are writing for children.	2000-06-07

Not bad for less than $20.  Pretty much, this book includes everything you need to know about the screenwriting business -- especially  if you're a rookie.<br />With six completely different books, it's easy to  find the information you need to start on the road to screenwriting  stardom.  The sections cross-reference, so the book can be a tad bit  repetitive at times, but this is useful as it grounds important facts into  your brain.<br />One of the things I appreciated about this book was the  information on writing for TV as well as the Silver Screen.  I also  appreciated the detailed treatment of that oh-so-important detail,  STRUCTURE of your script.<br />Because of the price and the sheer amount of  information included, I give this book five stars: good value, good  information, pleasant writing -- a winner!	2000-06-05

This book includes four sections which address  different specific spiritual issues including christian unity, economic  disaster, spiritual warfare and the enemy's attack on the church, and an  allegory called &quot;Escape from Christendom&quot; by Robert  Burnell.<br />Although &quot;Visions of the Harvest&quot; did not have the  broad scope of Rick Joyner's better known &quot;The Final Quest,&quot; this  work did address some specific issues that deserve attention and  consideration.<br />If you are interested in what God is saying to today's  prophets, begin with Joyner's &quot;The Final Quest,&quot; and move through  his books.  &quot;Visions of the Harvest&quot; is exactly what the title  calls it -- glimpses into what the future may hold and what our  responsibility is in the future.	2000-05-30

She's really good at selling shoes, and visits her Grandma at the nursing home.  At the same time, she seems approachable, like an old pal, or your best  friend.  Someone you can hang out with, appreciate, and learn from.<br />At  the same time, some of her antics seem really far-fetched for a 16-year  old.  Some of the more shocking things she does, however, don't serve to  completely save the day, so I can forgive her for not doing what I  expected.  I appreciated that the author didn't take the easy way out --  she addressed several hard issues that many kids today have to face:  alzheimer's, ageism, broken homes, parents who aren't perfect, and even  death.<br />This is by far one of the best books for Young Adults I've read.  I haven't met a heroine this promising since Meg Murry in A Wrinkle in  Time.	2000-05-26

However &quot;fresh&quot; this collection of short stories is, a novel it isn't.  Thinking it was a novel, I was confused when  no greater storyline emerged.  By the time I read the fifth  &quot;chapter&quot; I realized that all I could hope for was a series of  short stories.<br />Not a bad thing, but don't call it a novel if it isn't  one.<br />I enjoyed Melissa Bank's humor, and some of her creations (namely  Jane) had depth of character.  I LOVED the last story -- it actually  elicited an emotional response from me, unlike most of the stories, which  turned out to be merely interesting but not engaging.  I thought the ending  was quite abrupt, though.  I thought Bank owed us more than such a sudden  ending.  After all, we read all her stories and we deserve to know  &quot;what happens next?&quot;<br />Read this book, but just remember it is a  collection of short stories, and be emotionally prepared for the fact that  they don't tie together in a more meaningful way.	2000-05-26

Not so with this book.<br />Instead of focusing on ONE dominant personality style (such as  Meiers-Briggs 'ENTP'), the Self-Portrait graphs your personality traits,  which provides a way to visualize the way your personality works.  Instead  of being shoved into one of twenty personality types, you can see the  different categories that are more dominant in your personality.  This way,  you are shown a more accurate portrayal of yourself, and the results are  more individualized than a test which gives you ONE category that explains  your WHOLE SELF.<br />Useful in each chapter: &quot;tips&quot; for living with  persons in each category, &quot;tips&quot; for making the most of your  personality style, and warning signs for each style's potential personality  disorder (as detailed by the DSM-IV).<br />I was very happy with the questions  in the test, with the descriptions of the personality types, and the way  the book doesn't just lump you into one category.  Also, I appreciated the  Personality Disorder section in each category (simply as a matter of  interest, if nothing else).<br />The only thing I missed in the book was the  treatment of spirituality/religion (only slightly touched upon in ONE  personality category).<br />Overall, I now understand my personality much more  fully!	2000-02-07

I was motivated to read this book after writing an extensive journal entry on my standard-yet-traumatic adolescence (a time  which I have worked to forget!).<br />I now understand my own adolescence  more than I ever did before.  I have come to terms with issues in my own  life, as well as recognizing the phenomenal job my parents did in raising  me.  I have identified potential areas to watch for in my own (future)  daughters.  I have been instilled with the desire to positively impact  adolescent girls in any way I can now -- whether that be through  babysitting, teaching, or just treating them with respect when they show up  at the store in which I work.<br />I am grateful to Pipher for her interest in  this subject, and the sensitivity which she exhibited in dealing with the  clients who illuminate the pages of the book.  I was moved to anger for the  injustices our daughters are forced to endure, and fought back tears at the  lack of love that many of them experience.<br />I was made aware of situations  that I was not previously aware of:  persistent yet quiet misogyny in the  classroom, the self-detachment many girls undergo in order to be socially  acceptable, and the simple persistence of terrible attitudes regarding sex  &amp; sexuality in our junior highs (and I was IN junior high in the early  nineties!).  I was reminded of cultural situations which HAVE bothered me:  lookism, sexism, physical/emotional/sexual abuse.<br />Mostly, I have been  moved from a state of defeated, dispassionate indifference to an inferno of  anger against society's &quot;junk values&quot;.<br />Please, if you deal  with adolescent girls, read this book.  It may save their lives.	2000-02-01
