US	52249651	RWFV29DVDU2ZB	1401200702	5681285	Authority, The: Human on the Inside	Books	2	9	15	N	N	Excellent art with little other redeeming value	This latest offering from yet another writer helming Warren Ellis' take on the superteam is - unsurprisingly - watered down and rather disappointing.  Which each successive shift in scriptor, The Authority loses momentum.  &#34;Human on the Inside&#34; is no exception.<br /><br />When The Authority rose from the ashes of Ellis' spectacular Stormwatch run, it turned mainstream comics on their collective head.  Finally, a title and universe in which the controlling characters cared nothing for the status quo.  What a concept, right?  Interestingly, Ellis picked some curiously inoffensive ways to show this - the elimination of a terrorist government; the genocide of a facist alien race from another dimension; and the execution of an alien superbeing which might have been God.  It wasn't until Millar took over that the team starting really doing pre-emptive &#34;social&#34; work, and while the story arcs remained intriguing, they set the groundwork for the eventual watering down of the title.<br /><br />Early on, the pattern of The Authority (hilariously parodied by Gail at Comic Book Resources) consisted of:<br /><br />Crisis Exposition -&#62; Initial Encounter/Potential Setback -&#62; Cool Utterances By Team -&#62; Stunning Victory -&#62; More Cool Utterances By Team<br /><br />All in four issues.  Not bad.  With Ellis and Millar's topics (somewhat typically super-herioc), the arcs could be reasonably fleshed out and explored with some variety before closing.  However, keeping to this rhythm over the last several shifts in writing has made what was once fresh and effective now predictable and somewhat trite.  Some of this is momentum, but much of it has to do with the heavyhanded political commentary that sometimes substitutes for plot in the title.<br /><br />So we get this one-shot, &#34;Human on the Inside.&#34;  It seems like a reasonable premise - the future of the world is brought to crisis because there's no hope.  The current superpantheon is brought to their knees because they're shown how human they are beneath the tights and BAMF speeches.  A mere mortal saves their collective butt, but Swift has been disappeared for some Very Nefarious Subplot Involving Victimizing A Woman And Familial Vengeance.  There's potential here, right?<br /><br />Well, as we all should know, potential doesn't mean execution.  &#34;Human On The Inside&#34; makes the mistake of oversimplification and rush.  It turns out that everyone's suffering from collective existentialist angst; the entire team gets whiny; the very cool mortal can see into everyone's psychological and tactical weakness (and he's sexy, too!), yet they keep him around.  There's no exploration of anything - no nuance or transition that would have made this a story instead of a treatment.  You're introduced to the cause of the planetary angst and say, &#34;WTF?  Where did that come from?&#34;  The big twists that turn subplot into plot points come almost out of nowhere.  Characters have changes of heart without reason.  And worst of all, everything returns to status quo at the end.<br /><br />That's right - at the end of the story, everything is peachy-keen hunky-dory again.  No one experiences any sort of shift in character from being exposed to their vulnerability.  If that's the case, then what was the point of this story?  If the world inside you doesn't move forwards or backwards when you're faced with your limitations, what was the point of having faced them?  As such, the story becomes a wasted opportunity.<br /><br />Now, having griped about the story, I have nothing but praise for the art.  The work is solid, and I have always enjoyed a slightly &#34;pencilly&#34; feel and somewhat muted color tones.  I don't know if the book was painted, but Ben Oliver's art has that feel.  While staying faithful the original character designs, Oliver has brought freshness to The Authority's artwork, which frankly has been suffering since the departure of Quitely (whose work I don'tparticularly like but is at least distinctly interesting).<br /><br />And so this is where &#34;Human on the Inside&#34; earns its two stars - Oliver's art.  I don't know if Ridley (the author) was confined to a page count, but for the story he started, he wrote more of a treatment than a comic.  Combine that with the waste of narrative arc, and no points are earned for writing.  Two stars are where it stands, solely on the merits of Ben Oliver.ose work I don't particularly like but is at least distinctly interesting).   <br /> <br />And so this is where &#34;Human on the Inside&#34; earns its two stars - Oliver's art.

US	52249651	R1TBI2LBWNW9I1	0971633843	505470878	24 Hour Comics	Books	5	45	47	N	N	24 Hour Goodness	So here's the challenge (read more about it at 24hourcomics dot com):  you have blank pages and nothing prepared; the clock starts; 24 hours later, the clock stops and you have a 24-page comic - scripted, laid out, penciled, inked, and lettered.  That's it.<br /><br />Considering that the average professional comic team takes 320+ hours an average to get that far, it's a hell of challenge.  To put in other terms - the challenge is to do 320 hours of work in 7.5% of the time normally needed.<br /><br />It should be no surprise that the 24 Hour Comics Challenge is the brainchild of Scott McCloud, the author of \\"Understanding Comics\\" and \\"Reinventing Comics.\\"  McCloud is clearly a man of ideas, but don't let that fool ya - he is no dusty academic.  McCloud has a love for comics, a passion for the stories and the way they're told, and this collection shows it.<br /><br />McCloud did the first 24 Hour Comic in 1990.  In the fourteen years since, he's received thousands upon thousands of pages from others who have taken the challenge.  In this collection, McCloud has brought together his nine favorite stories.<br /><br />The anthology's breadth and variety is phenomenal - from established artists like Steve Bissette to respected author Neil Gaiman to unknown amateur Paul Winkler, the stories here show just what the human imagination is capable of.  There's a comic about Zen; the day in the life of a cat; meditations on a Roman emporer; and tragic life which is also bizarrely comical.<br /><br />Remember - these stories were conceived at the start of each 24 hour period.  None of these were outlined and planned before the clock started ticking.  These are not \\"polished\\" in any sense - these stories were written and drawn in an intense white heat of creativity that had to be sustained through exhaustion, sleep deprivation, and the like.  What's amazing is that anything coherent - much less comprehensible and visually appealing and communicative - could be constructed in such a short amount of time.  This is the free jazz of comics, and it's way cool stuff.<br /><br />The 24 Hour Comic has spawned some intersting variants:  the 24 Hour Play, the 48 Hour Movie, and the 24 Hour Dot Com.  It's also the subject of at least two documentaries (to my knowledge) and become an annual event.  Nat Gertler, the publisher of the About Comics line and organizer of the first 24 Hour Comics Day (2004), has just announced the dates for 24 Hour Comics Day 2005.  You can find out more details at 24hourcomics dot com.<br /><br />In the meantime, read the anthologies (there's also a 2004 highlights book) and consider trying the challenge yourself.  The only con is that you'll lose a night's sleep.  The pros:  you'll end up with a comic (or part of one) at the end of the period, and you'll learn something about comics, art, writing, and perhaps yourself in the end.  Give it, and the stories, a try.  It's worth the effort.tructed in such a short amount of time.

The major companies weren't doing anything remotely interesting and had started the whole mess of needing to buy 5 titles to get a single story; Image hadn't come along to with creator-owned stuff yet; and Jademan had pulled out of the US market.  Sure, there were a few bright spots - The Vertigo line was just starting, but overall, it was pretty bleak.<br /><br />All of a sudden, Heavy Metal got a second wind and started publishing *good* stories again - full of life and vibrance and with plots and art that weren't afraid of nay-saying normalists.  Nothing lasts forever, but for a few years, Heavy Metal was the place to go for interesting stories every month.<br /><br />Reading *Flight* took me back to those days, back to when, as a jaded teen, I opened up Heavy Metal and was blown away by the vitality of the art and writing on the page.<br /><br />Kazu Kibuishi's genius was to ask a bunch of his webcomics and artist friends to contribute to an anthology, which was intended for a small press release.  Little did they know that Image Comics would see their work and be blown away enough to publish it, thus ensuring that a larger audience would read it.<br /><br />*Flight* is a collection of stories, many of them having to do with flying, but not all.  There's an action story involving a zeppelin; a wonderful mixed-media story about discovering people you've know for years; a nearly wordless piece about triumphing over fear (my personal fave, done by Dylan Meconis and Bill Mudron); a post-script by Scott McCloud; and a couple \\"Copper\\" pieces by Kazu himself (featured on his website [...]<br /><br />These are comics, pure and simple.  Graphic storytelling at its best by people who don't care about \\"rules\\" in art and who didn't wait for \\"permission\\" to make their own book.  There's nothing trendy or throw-away in this book - no manga, no steroid-superheroes, no grim lines to be muttered in a badas$mofo manner.  Little tales - some cute, some dark, some deeply personal, some poetic.  All of 'em wonderful.<br /><br />Pick it up.  Pick it up and read it.  And then give it to a friend.

US	52249651	R155DL515SF9N7	1740591623	980122332	Lonely Planet Japan	Books	5	1	2	N	Y	Exceptional!	Of a five-week junket to Asia in 2003, Taiwan formed the first wing and Japan the second.  The Lonely Planet guides for each locale accompanied me for both wings my Asian vacation.<br />Considering how dreadful the Taiwan guide was (you can check out my review of it), the Japan guide was remarkably voluminous and useful.  I used the 7th edition for my trip (the 8th came out while I was overseas), but, as outdated as it was, it still proved to be an excellent resource for my trip.<br />First facts - I speak only restaurant and &quot;ninja&quot; Japanese, am Chinese, and am ninhogo-illiterate, so I was plopped into the middle of a country where I had few internal resources to call on.  Armed with the Lonely Planet guide and reasonable phrasebook, I was able to navigate my way through Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Miyajima, Nagoya, and Himeji without any significant problems.  The restaurant recommendations were pretty much on the mark - the okonomiyaki and fugu joints in Osaka were outstanding in quality and price, and the gyoza recommended in Kyoto was phenomenally tasty, to pick a few.<br />The city maps were pretty accurate, although some of the club and bar scene locales were defunct or vague.  Eschewing the book's rec's after a couple of disappointments, I started hitting random places that looked, and were in fact, pretty cool.  The tourist spot info is pretty accurate and includes stuff that sometimes isn't noted in the local tourist literature (I highly recommend checking out the little &quot;meditation&quot; waterfall mentioned in the Kyoto section).<br />Lonely Planet Japan is an exceptional guide book.  I would recommend it to anyone who is planning a trip Japan-wards, regardless of taste - this book covers everything. I intend to purchase the latest edition before my next trip there (soon, I hope!).	2004-03-04

The introductions and anecdotes preceding each story is a fascinating look into the writer's craft and the mind of a lifelong (though more talented than most) dilletante.<br />This is really the only opportunity left to us in (somewhat widely) available print to see Bester when he's not spinning wildly inventive fiction or fantasy.  While one can still find *My Affair With Science Fiction* re-printed here and there, where else are we going to find the source material for the characters of &quot;Hell is Forever&quot; or Bester's personal opinion of Dillenger?  <br />Perhaps *Re-Demolished* provides us with a wider spectrum of Bester's works (there are a few pieces there with NO ties to science fiction), but in *Starlight* we get glorious flashes of Bester away from the fantasy: occasional glimpses of libaries, foreign lands, fishing trips, and television studios.<br />Alfred Bester was a prodigious 20th-century talent, and *Starlight* allows us to get as close to a conversation with him as possible.  <br />Rest in peace, Alfie.	2003-10-27
US	52249651	R2PQF8CJG5MH9J	1864502118	669642870	Lonely Planet Taiwan	Books	2	3	3	N	Y	Very unbalanced	The LP guide to Taiwan is great if you want to hit tourist traps.  However, those choosing a more flexible approach to travel may be disappointed.  This particular guide is particularly short on some vital information that makes it almost worthless as a reference for trip planning.<br />For example:  Mr. Storey lists exactly two bus stops in the Taroko Gorge area, leading one to believe that you can only use public bus transport two these places only.  He doesn't mention that the bus also makes intermittent stops along the way, even to trails he listed in the guide.  According to the locals, these stops were established years ago, and this information would have been easily obtainable by the author.<br />The guide is almost worthless when it comes to Kinmen, which has far more interesting sights and places then those listed.  Having just visited Kinmen this week, a little exploration revealed all sorts of bike trails one could follow to some spectacular vistas.  Again, this is all public knowledge - why wasn't this included?<br />On the other hand, Mr. Storey's information on expat hangouts has proven pretty accurate so far, and when he does list hiking trails, he has been correct in the four locations I've visted.  His hotel information has also proven quite invaluable.<br />It is hoped that the author will spend more time and effort in investigating things a little more off the beaten track and provide us with some better information to work with.	2003-08-23
US	52249651	R1G3M80WWQNH21	1569715025	939901270	Lone Wolf and Cub, Vol. 1: Assassin's Road	Books	5	22	23	N	Y	A compelling historical drama set in graphic novel form	(Note:  For reader convenience, Western nomenclature is used - given name first, family name last.)<br />The Western world's exposure to the Samurai culture has been rather limited - the most popular venues to the mass public have been the movies *Shogun Assassin* and *The Seven Samurai*.  Both are fine examples of the film genre, but because the nature of film, neither really delves into the bushido mindset as deeply as I would like.<br />It is in the arena of the comic book that the best explorations of the samurai legend have been achieved.  Two titles come to mind - Stan Sakai's *Usagi Yojimbo* and Kazuo Koike's *Lone Wolf and Cub* (*Shogun Assassin* was based on the latter's film adaptation).<br />The title reflects the content manner - Itto Ogami, the protagonist, is a highly-skilled ronin who travels with his toddler son, taking assassin's work whenever it comes but always assuring (sometimes indirectly) that the job upholds his strict sense of bushido.<br />Some might say that the idea of an assassin with bushido is self-contradictory.  However, under the skillful pen of Koike, Ogami's methods allow him to follow his chosen path and hold on to his honor simultaneously.  His requirements regarding his assignments are simple - cash money and complete disclosure about the nature of the assignment, including the often compromising details.<br />In this first volume (~300 pages of more than 8000), we are treated to tales of Ogami's skill and prowess as a swordsman and strategist.  His is an unorthodox approach to the samurai arts, and he is absolutely merciless to his victims.  His son often collaborates in the assignments, usually as a set-up ploy.  While ruthless to his opponents, he is also capable of great compassion and does have a very human side; one chapter, in particular, explores the reasons he left the prestigious post of the Shogun's personal executioner (the one chosen to assist in ritual suicide by decapitation) in order to journey down `the path to Hell.'<br />Those familiar with manga will no doubt find the ink stylings of Goseki Kojima familiar; it is similar to that of Sanpei Shirato's *The Legend of Kamui,* but Kojima's work is more articulate. Eschewing typical manga character design and expanding on traditional concepts of sequential movement, Kojima draws sensitive and articulate portraits while simultaneously transporting us directly into the middle of dramatic battle.  Horror; amusement, contempt, compassion; anger; longing - none are beyond the reach of his pen.<br />I recommend *Lone Wolf and Cub* to any who wish a good read.  With much to offer a diverse audience - drama, mystery, action, plot, and character development - it is a series that reads and presents itself well.  You need not be a comics enthusiast or a Japanophile to enjoy this work - its execution is that well wrought. Drawing on historical fact, East Asian military classics, an eye for detail, and an innate sense of drama, Koike and Kojima give us something that will surely become a great classic.Hell.'<br />Those familiar with manga will no doubt find the ink stylings of Goseki Kojima familiar; it is similar to that of Sanpei Shirato's *The Legend of Kamui,* but Kojima's work is more articulate.

Thompson's &quot;Fear and Loathing:  On the Campaign Trail  '72.&quot;<br />In other words, this is DEFINITELY NOT a comic book for your  average child or teen.  Ellis makes no pretense in writing for an adult  audience.<br />Mixed in with the off-color jokes and futuristic musings are  meditations, of a sort, on what's wrong with the world - gerrymandering all  the poor people into a single community with cheap housing, traitorous  political tradeoffs that sell out all the principles that the platform  supposedly stands on, and the futility of voting between two evils, to name  a few.

I'd suggest you pick it up after watching a couple campaign adds and  feeling your brain mush into gel from all the bull that you're being  fed.<br />I'm going to end this with something beautiful:<br />A bald man with a  spider tattooed on his forehead has just injected a stimulant into his tear  duct.

He is an older brainchild of Warren Ellis from his pre-Stormwatch days.<br />Lazarus is  technically immortal.  The vast majority of his body was shorn away at the  genetic base level and replaced with highly resilient intelligent plastics  capable of adapting to any situation in approximately the time it takes for  a thought to be fired from the brain to another part of the body.  At the  time in which we see him, he's been alive for approximately 400 years, in  which the world has seen plagues, revolutions, ethnic cleansings, and  corporate takeovers of sinister proportions (much like &quot;The  Company&quot; so often referred to in the &quot;Alien&quot; series).  We  are presented with four misadventures in the life of our antihero as he  consumes prodigious quantities of drugs and wishes for death while casually  dispatching anyone who gets in his way or those which he maintains strained  friendships.<br />The language is short, sweet, and stylish.  Ellis creates a  futurespeak which tastes familiar if you've read &quot;A Clockwork  Orange&quot; but is an entirely different creature of its own.  &quot;Creation&quot; is the preferred slang of Lazarus' time, but we are  thankfully spared the task of having to decipher it ourselves.<br />If you're  a fan of Ellis' later works, you can't help but notice shades of  &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; begging to be fully fleshed out.<br />The art is  dark, depending heavily on shades of purple and red.  At times seeming  almost amateurish, one cannot help but be struck by the masterful  sequencing and panelling choices, not to mention the skill at which  &quot;the gutter&quot; (as Scott McCloud put it) is used.<br />Although  out-of-print, &quot;The Lazarus Churchyard Collection&quot; can still be  found in some out-of-the-way places (I found my copy in the bargain bin of  a Newbury Comics in Boston).

Some new characters were created, some current characters were killed off, and other  currents were &quot;re-worked.&quot;  After all the huss and fuss, only two  re-worked post-Zero Hour characters have earned any real following, and  only one has earned a consistent following.  Green Lantern's mailbag is  mixed - there seem to be just as many readers who hate the current GL as  those who love him.<br />And then there is Jack Knight, a character that has  earned a true cult following.  We Starman fans are legion, but we are a  quiet although enthusiastic bunch.<br />Why is Jack so popular?  My personal  take on it is that he is the only Gen-X'er DC character with a regular book  who truly personifies heroism.  No fancy trappings, no hidden agendas, no  driving psychoses...Jack Knight is a hero of the Superman and Hal Jordan  (Silver Age Green Lantern) vein - motivated to do good because it is right  to do so.  At first, it is a fight for survival and a reluctant duty, but  by the end of this collection, we begin the see little hints that perhaps -  just perhaps - he's beginning to enjoy his new-found role.<br />Jack is also  the most human of all the DC heroes...not only do we see his heroic role,  but with later books, we see more of his personal life than those of other  heros...not just his relationships with women, but his day-to-day  interactions.  While he fights, he enters a sort of Zen mode and his  thoughts often wander to other things in his life - usually to aspects of  his job and hobby as a junk/collectibles dealer and scout.  At love with  the past but comfortable with the present (althought a little nervous about  the future), our man Jack is a person whom I believe many of us would like  to be, if only for a short while.  His easy-going nature lends an air of  light to his earthbound side, and his concrete sense of responsibility is  tempered with a good sense of humor.  He is a contemporary person.  And he  is a human being, first and foremost.  Jack also has (as you will see in  later volumes) a bit of the old hero in his makeup - a Knight clad in black  leather jacket and night-vision goggles as opposed to the traditional  armor.<br />In this first volume, we are introduced to the relationships  within the Knight family and some of the histories which have caused a  strain on the family ties.  We are also introduced to The Mist and his  family, and by the conclusion, we see the creation of who I feel to the  most devastatingly cunning and psychotically diabolical villian in DC's  current lineup - Nash, the new Mist.  In addition, the rest of the cast and  company begins to take shape in the form of Shade and the O'Dare family of  law enforcers.<br />Robinson's writing is top-notch, as usual, with flowing  dialogue and engaging internal monologues.  However, it is the artwork of  Harris and the inking of von Grawbadger that hooked me in initially.  Creating an odd balance between the portrait-like &quot;realism&quot; of  other mainstream comics and the linear art-deco sense of the  &quot;Batman&quot; animated series,  Harris and Grawbadger blaze new ground  in sequential art by bold use of shade, line, and angle.  The faces are  unusually expressive, and the lack of muscular exagerration is wonderfully  refreshing and adds a sense of humanism to the characters (in a later  volume, Harris' depiction of Batman is wonderfully &quot;ordinary&quot; - a  regular-looking guy in a Batman outfit).<br />&quot;Sins of the Father&quot;  is a wonderful start to the Jack Knight &quot;Starman&quot; years.

The plot is a down-on-his-luck old fisherman hooks a huge marlin, is pulled out to sea before killing it, and loses it to various shark attacks on his return  voyage. 2.  There's not a lot of action. 3.  Yes, the old man talks to his  hand (and a bird, and the fish).<br />Personally, I feel that the most  compelling aspect of this wonderful novel is the struggle inherent within  the old man's task.  It's a labor for something he not only wants but  needs.  It's an uphill climb against a gradient that only gets steeper.  He  succeeds, but only to lose the prize in the end.<br />Yet, at the end of it  all, he is not defeated.  He is ready to sleep, to wake, and to do it all  again.<br />Call it the triumph of the human spirit when pitted against all  odds.<br />I first read this book in the fourth grade, after one of my parents  left it laying around the living room.  I finished it within three  hours.<br />Ever since, I've made it a point to pick it up at least once a  year.  I'm now 24 years old.  And I still find it to be an absolutely  captivating novel.<br />-J.	1999-06-17

On almost every page, I find at least three or four poses worthy of drawing.<br />This volume focuses on what seem to be dance-like movments, mostly done a level perspective.<br />I do have one complaint, which  is the print quality of the pictures is a little grainy.  This is of course  due to the film speed required to capture clear movements, but the  processing probably could have been done a little better.<br />However, the  graininess of the images does not detract from usability of this book.

In this fairly slender volume, Mr. Yun covers the majority of the biomechanical principles involved in the complex art of  chin-na.<br />Like Sifu Park Bok Nam's excellent texts on Baguazhang, the  idea is not to delineate technique but rather to expound on theory and  principle - the fundamentals, so to speak, from which technique may be  built.<br />For those of you who are looking for a library of chin-na  techniques, this is not for you. This book teaches instead the basic  principles behind chin-na. What may be derived from this book are not only  chin-na techniques but also chin-na escapes and counters. Makes sense to  me; if you really understand how something is done, then you also  understand how it is undone.<br />This book is a wonderful read on its own,  and it is an excellent companion to Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming's multiple  compendiums on chin-na.	1999-03-30

Even through Buck may have resided and grown up in China, she never really developed a sense of what  it was like. She knew her facts, but not once in this book did I ever feel  that she caught the essence, the ebb and flow, of the Chinese culture (yes,  I am of Chinese descent, 1st generation immigrant).<br />Mark Salzman did a  much better job of capturing the &quot;Chinese feel&quot; in *The Laughing  Sutra.* So did Sheryl Wudunn and Nicholas Kristoff in *China Wakes.* Both  books are ones I highly recommend.<br />As for *The Good Earth,* write your  papers and put it away.

Salzman's modern-day adaptation of the Chinese classic *Journey to the West* is a brilliant and touching tale. For those of you familiar with the original, the young hero embarks on a trip to the US in search of the  mysterious &quot;Laughing Sutra,&quot; much in the manner that the Buddhist  monk Tripathika went to India to bring the original sutras back to China.  Our hero is accompanied by Colonel Sun, who may or may not be the  celebrated Sun Wu-Kung himself.<br />It is a charming tale which captures in  many ways the feel of Chinese culture and the gap that has and will always  exist between East and West. In my opinion, Buck's *The Good Earth* should  be taken out of our contemporary school system and replaced with Salzman's  *Laughing Sutra.&quot; This is clearly the better novel with a better  &quot;China Feel&quot; than *Earth* ever had.	1999-02-19

My apologies for that. At the time I read it, I was a not-quite-but-almost-naive college junior, so  perhaps I will learn in time.<br />But regarding this book, I thought it was  pretty insightful. After countless late nights of sitting up and listening  to the woes of my women friends, I could easily detect echos of FOF in the  conversations.<br />This novel spawned at least three sequels. Perhaps  someone with firsthand (rather than my secondhand) experience with the  issues presented in those books could comment more specifically on them.  I'll limit myself to saying that while I did not find Fear of Flying to  self-serving or overly didatic, I did find its various sequels to be so,  the degree worsening as the chronology did.<br />*Fear of Flying* is an  Excellent Book, ladies and gentlemen.

This book was the first of its kind, a scholarly  study on a Chinese martial art which catapaulted the study of Chinese  martial arts to a new plateau, that of a &quot;serious&quot; and  &quot;intellectual&quot; level, something that was not recognized until  that point.<br />Sun, also adept in certain Taoist practices, successfully  integrated traditional Taoist thought structures and scientific  philosophies into his explanation of Chinese martial arts. *Xingyiquan Xue*  is a perfect example; Wuji and Taiji are perfectly coordinated into the  practice and application of Xingyiquan.<br />A note to potential readers;  contrary to common belief, Xingyiquan is not a &quot;soft&quot; art but a  &quot;hard&quot; one. Xingyiquan emphasizes attack, a &quot;hard&quot;  philosophy, where &quot;soft&quot; arts emphasize reception of attack.  Therefore, hard and soft refer to fighting philosophy and tactic;  Xingyiquan is an &quot;internal&quot; art, one that uses body energy and  coordination to generate power and movement, rather than overt muscular  power (example, tae kwon do). Therefore, if you want a &quot;soft&quot;  art, look for books on Yang style Taijiquan (Liang, Shou-Yu and Yang,  Jwing-Ming have written some good ones) and on Aikido.<br />This text also  features Sun's photos and drawing delineating his style of Xingyiquan,  which is the Five Elements/Twelve Animals style (versus the Six  Harmonies/Ten Animal styles). Also featured is a section showing the famous  two-man form, &quot;An Shen Pao.&quot; While the transitional movements are  not shown, practitioners of Xingyiquan should be able to immediately figure  out what's going on. Baguazhang practioners, such as myself, take a little  longer time.<br />If you are a person with an express interest in furthering  your internal martial arts education, this book is absolutely essential.  Even though he died in the 1930's, Sun Lu Tang's classics show that his  understanding of martial arts back then far surpasses that of 99% of the  martial artists alive today. I am fortunate to be studying under someone of  that 1%; perhaps this book can give you direction to find yourself as good  a teacher as mine.ioners, such as myself, take a little  longer time.<br />If you are a person with an express interest in furthering  your internal martial arts education, this book is absolutely essential.

All in all, pretty decent	This book is obviously not intended for the beginning Baguazhang student. Then again, there comes the argument as to whether there is anything as a beginning Baguazhang student, since it is a style generally analogized as  &quot;graduate school&quot; for martial artists.<br />The authors are quite  knowledgeable and clear with their content matter. While I distinctly  dislike the use of the phrase &quot;Taoist yoga/yogic,&quot; the outlining  of the qigong exercises were quite clear. The two-man drills were not so  clear, but for someone with experience in reading martial arts texts, they  were clear enough.<br />There's also some esoterica and history that is nice  to see. The outlining and use of the generational names of the Tung  Hai-Chuan lineage was especially interesting to me, as an  &quot;historical&quot; martial artist.<br />It's not the best book I've seen  on Baguazhang, but it certainly beats most others. For fundamental drilling  and body development work, I would suggest Sifu Park Bok Nam's &quot;The  Fundamentals of Baguazhang&quot; vols. I and II. For more translations and  mediocre form delineation, I would suggest Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming and Liang,  Shou-Yu's &quot;Emei Baguazhang.&quot; Having all three texts, I feel that  Mr. Bracy and his sifu's book is a fine complement to my Baguazhang and  internal Chinese arts library.	1999-01-25
US	52249651	RKMH5MPZFW9R2	0822206838	753332632	Lolita	Books	5	15	18	N	N	A loquacious, lolling LOVE story	Yes, H.H. is sick. Yes, he is perverse. Yes, at times he is sadistic. Yes, he is ignoble, a monster, and all other horrible things that should be jailed, put away, and never allowed to see the light of day.<br />But those  who read this novel without finding the love story contained within have  allowed themselves to entirely miss the point. And so have those who claim  it to be \\"dirty\\" or \\"exploitave\\" of children should read the book PERIOD.  And those who feel this novel is misogynistic are conveniently forgetting  that H. H. is contemptuous of ALL of the characters within, including  himself and his relations, regardless of race, creed, OR GENDER. Oh, of  course, he dwells on certain women, but that's because the people he spends  the most time with in this novel ARE women. And he certainly dedicates  quite a bit of time to denigrating Quilty; let us not forget that!<br />We  must first also realize that Lolita is not only about a middle-aged man's  decidedly unhealthy obsession with a teenaged girl. Lolita is also the tale  of two (stylized and heavily stereotyped, of course) civilizations  colliding, the \\"hypercivilized\\" Europe and the \\"barbaric\\" America  (postwar). It is also a fable about the conflict between the overly  analytical mind and the entirely emotional one (people who have studied  psychology can probably elucidate on this better than I can). It is a  satire on Freudian psychoanalysis. Finally, it is the result of one man's  remarkable love for a language, which I think that no one can refute, no  matter how appalled they are at the novel's content.<br />Where is the love in  the midst of all this horror, you ask? Perhaps those who cannot find it  have never experienced the terrible things that people do in spite of and  BECAUSE of the strength of their love. Humbert's sexual addiction to  Delores Haze is nothing less than an animalistic need to possess the object  of his obsession in the most obvious way. Humbert's patient attempts to  foster his captive's skills (whether they be tennis, literature, etc.)  reveals a desire to cultivate, as you will, what he sees as a supremely  fertile field.<br />And the sadism, I feel, was introduced for numerous  reasons. Of course, it was to show just how horrible a person can by taking  pleasure in the pain of another. But Nabokov also relayed the agony that  Humbert experienced while BEING sadistic, while hurting the one thing that  mattered most to him. Another significant, albeit rather twist, sign of  love.<br />Of course Dolores' thoughts and feelings matter to Humbert, but one  must remember that he is bent on possessing her. Therefore, her opinions on  life and the world at large matter not a whit to him; he is only interested  in what she thinks of him, but he is also able to ignore that part of her  because of he is battling to possess the rest of her, and because of his  \\"obvious\\" superiority to her, being a cultivated and educated adult  European and all.<br />And of course, the most obvious overture made to Venus  within this novel is the transference of Humbert's life (i.e., his assets)  to Dolores. Of course, he could have blackmailed her, tried to buy her  favors, kidnapped her for a second time, etc. But no, he cedes over all  that is his to her and leaves. Granted, it is a small reparation, but it is  all he can do by that point. It is the closest he can come to giving her  back the life that he stole (her own, not Charlotte's) away and casually  tore apart, and it is his attempt at absolution, not only for himself, but  for her sake (read the last few paragraphs if you're shaking your head). It  is this action that thinly separates H. H. from the everyday male monsters  within our society.<br />Of course, I've focused on defending the love story  within from H. H.'s point of view, since there is none from the character  of Dolores. I will not go into Dolores' blatantly whorelike nature, which  granted, was partially due to H. H.'s influence, but was clearly present  BEFORE any contact was made between them. I will skip over (because of  space) Charlotte's utter disregard and contempt for her own  daughter<br />What's the upshot of all this? Well, first of all, I would like  to make a few admissions. Yes, I am male. No, I am no professor of English,  of literature, or of anything. But I do love the English language, I do  love wonderful writing, I abhor H. H., and I find his actions within  repulsive, horrifying, and warranting the harshest punishment available. I  think spouse abusers should be beaten to a pulp and that rapists should be  castrated. I don't think this is an appropriate book for most children and  some adults.<br />And I am certainly no pedophile.<br />The upshot is that I  firmly believe that Lolita is one of the finest and horrifying novels in  the English language. And I, for one, feel that it is clearly a love story.  And I'm not alone; I have many women friends and colleagues who have  expressed similar opinions to mine, some of whom are English literature  teachers, all of whom are strong and independent women (feminists, if we  must use that silly and degrading label).<br />Those who cannot see the  horrible and tragic drama of love in these pages should step off of their  soapboxes, take closer look, and recognize this text for what it's for.

Included in this book are sections of Sun Lu Tang's *The Study  of Baguazhang* and *The Real Meaning of Boxing,* neither of which have been  released for general publication in English yet.  The basic 8 palms Master  Liang presents comprises the basic Baguazhang set that seems to have been  taught at the Central Kuoshu Institute at Nanking. The lineage is Fu  Chen-Sung's, and the form is also known by the name of &quot;Old Eight  Palms.&quot; A good standard form with a decent presentation. As usual,  Master Liang concentrates heavily on the Shuaijiao elements of the form (as  he did in his book on simplified Taijiquan). The &quot;Swimming  Dragon&quot; form presented seems to have come from Sun Lu Tang's lineage.  I have no clue as to where the Deer Horn Swords form comes from. While Dr.  Yang and Master Liang do a pretty decent job of delineating general  Baguazhang principles, as usual, when presenting form and application, the  level isn't as high as most would like. The form, while more than  compentantly demonstrated, doesn't give a good presentation of the  precision footwork that is one of the trademarks of Baguazhang. The  applications shown within are done at the lowest level; it would have been  nice to see greater variations on technique based on simple things, such  has a different positioning of the forward palm or smaller stepping,  although I realize that due to the sophistication of the art and philosophy  behind it, doing so would have been difficult. All in all, it's a good book  to have if one is interested in pursuing Baguazhang. As a reference book,  it's great. However, if one wishes to get a more in-depth look to the art  via training methods, I would recommend Sifu Park Bok Nam and Dan Miller's  *Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chang.*	1998-12-07

I do not own a copy of it; I read about half of it in the book store, and that was enough to convince me that Mr. Tegner does not know a whole lot  about Chinese kung-fu.  *Note: This is not to say that Mr. Tegner  knowledgable about fighting or other styles of martial arts, just that his  kung-fu knowledge is very limited.  The statement that tipped me off the  most was the commentary on the taichi (&quot;yin-yang&quot;), something to  the effect that the influence of the symbol's philosophy is negligable at  best in the practice of Chinese martial arts. Horse manure. The Taoist  concepts of yin and yang are obviously prevalent in all aspects of all  existing styles of classical Chinese kung-fu. From health to breathing to  combat theory to body positioning, the presence of the Tao is obvious to  any who care to look closely. The concept of balancing oneself out, whether  through physical means or attack/defense philosophy, is carefully woven  into surviving true Chinese systems. The Chinese &quot;katas&quot; that  were shown were quite laughable. The kung-fu form seemed to be a bad parody  of stylized jeet kune do mixed with boxing and a poor imitation of the Sil  Lum Tao form of Wing Chun. The &quot;modern interpretation&quot; of Tai Chi  violated so many positioning principles, one has to wonder where or with  whom the choreographer studied Tai Chi, if they studied it at all. Both  seemed to be poor improvisations based on some movements briefly seen from  quite a long distance away. This is a terrible book on the subject of  Chinese kung-fu. Anyone interested in learning classical Chinese kung-fu  should look up Bucksom Kong, Yang Jwing-Ming, and Bok Nam Park (a classical  Pa Kua Chang master) and seek out any English translations of Chinese  kung-fu books. Granted, they won't all be gems, but they're almost all  guaranteed to be better than this piece of rubbish.	1998-11-23

Sifu Park is a wonderful teacher and holds nothing back in imparting the system which he has inherited. Volume  II of Sifu Park's book contains yet another wealth of information while  emphasizing the basic and  fundamental concepts laid out in the first. It  is meant to read and used as a written reference for those who have already  learned the content of the first volume. I write &quot;learned&quot; rather  than &quot;mastered&quot; because it takes years of practice to truly  master the contents of the first volume. In the second volume, Sifu Park  begins to build up the student's repertoire of techniques, fundamental  exercises, and theoretical concepts. Generally speaking, in Sifu's school  and study groups, it takes about a year to two years (depending on your  background and willingness to practice) to get a handle on all of the  teachings from the first voume. The second volume could easily take six to  seven years of practice before one learns everything. Sifu also begins to  show some fighting applications and the &quot;variations on a theme&quot;  concepts that are Pa Kua trademarks. If one wishes to learn the exercises  within these books, the videos are essential if a student group is not  readily available. However, without the videos, the books give excellent  insights into not only what is known as the most effective internal martial  art created but also into general martial arts practice, applications, and  the building of good fundamentals.	1998-11-23

Along with Bok Nam Park's books, Mr. Hsu has written the one of the best source guide on Chinese martial arts that I have ever read. A collection of columns written for a magazine, Mr. Hsu writes with clarity, precision,  history, and passion. Mr. Adam Hsu is a world-renowned teacher of Chinese  martial arts systems. He is best known for publicly disseminating the  Bajiquan and Piguazhang systems to the public, as well as his high level of  attainment in the Yin-Fu lineage of Baguazhang. In this slender volume, Mr.  Hsu (since I am not his student, I may not refer to him as  &quot;Sifu&quot;) brings forth the philosophies and theory surrounding the  most popular but  least-understood family of martial arts in the West.  There are no forms in this text; rather, it is a well-thought-out  compilation of articles that will benefit all levels of Chinese martial  artists.  In fact, it has a thing or two to teach non-Chinese martial arts  practitioners, as well. For anyone who cares to put a little thought into  things, this is the book.	1998-11-23

I have not read this, the latest edition, but I doubt that the content has changed significantly.<br />What makes this book so good is the fact that it  is highly readable. The stories, poems, and plays selected for the text are  chosen to appeal to a wide audience. A plethora of writers that span the  Middle Ages to the mid-20th century appear within these pages. It is a  wonderful overview of English literature, and I feel that it makes a much  better book than the Nortan Anthologies simply because it doesn't focus on  one medium, nation, or time period.<br />What also appeals to me about this  text is the space given to non-Shakespearean authors, esp. of the  Elizabethan times. Too often, ol' *Romeo*'s bard pops up, and we are  deprived of a chance to learn about other (and possibly greater) writers,  such as Jonson, Marlowe, and (my favorite) Donne.<br />Five years ago, I  complete my high school senior English lit. course with the fifth edition  of this text. My teacher was sufficiently impressed with my taking to the  volume that she discreetly &quot;loaned&quot; me an old fourth edition.  This red tome has journeyed across the country with me, and I hope is that  one day my children and grandchildren will derive as much pleasure from it  as I have. Whenever I feel the urge to read something substantial but not  take a few weeks to do so, *SS&amp;S* has always been there for me. Order  this book, and you will never need for a short classic again.	1998-11-22

I seem to be the only person I know personally that  wasn't forced/encouraged to read this book in a French/classical Lit.  class.<br />I'm not disappointed.<br />I think that those who don't see the  satire in this text perhaps don't pay too much attention to their  surroundings. Voltaire is poking fun at things much larger than the  Leibnizian philosophy that serves as the focal point for attack in this  this novella; the central message (contained within the last few lines of  the story) is that there are more pressing, immediate, and pragmatic  concerns to life than philosophies, dogmas, and the like. Voltaire was the  pragmatic's philosopher, the anti-philosopher in many senses. His rejection  of blind followings, philosophical &quot;proof,&quot; and  &quot;schools&quot; of thought is clear within this sharp-witted  text.<br />It's a great read for anyone who's been stomped on for thinking  &quot;outside of the box.&quot; I would recommend that those readers with a  more thorough background (and interest) in religious and philosophical  literature and history look up Voltaire's magnum opus, the *Philosophical  Dictionary.* Don't be fooled by its title; it's anything but dry, stale  definitions.<br />A great read with some light Mozart and good tea.<br />=)	1998-11-22

In fact, that's the entire point.<br />I certainly enjoy this book  every time I pick it up. In fact, the reference that sparked my curiousity  came from a wonderful Woody Allen short story whose title escapes me.  Roth's ascerbic prose is at peak form here, and considering the direction  he took (which is fine, in my opinion), *PC* is his most readable work  prior to 1996's *American Pastoral.* His characters are vivid and unique,  as usual, and while *PC* does feature Roth's signature abrupt ending, for  once, it fits rather well.<br />What I've found most fascinating about this  work is that the history and complaints of Alexander Portnoy are extremely  similar to those I've heard expressed by Asian-Americans who were raised in  the US between 1970 through the present. The level of familial pressure and  guilt laid upon Roth's narrator are quite equal to countless stories I've  heard of like upbringings in households of first-generation immigrants.  While obviously not everything parallels (no strict dietary laws unless one  is patently Buddhist), the vast majority of it fits, sometimes almost  frighteningly so.<br />I leave with a warning and a recommendation. If one is  easily offended by sex matters and graphic language, one should avoid this  volume. However, I have recommended this book in the past to several of my  friends, all of whom have enjoyed it, and I do so now for the curious who  have had the patience to read to this end of this quaint review.	1998-11-21
US	52249651	R18GN2BFY32X0A	0671729179	2385194	A Gypsy Good Time	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Dark vision, dark humor, highly successful on all counts	Mr. Hasford goes unrecognized in his own time as a literary genius.<br />*A Gypsy Good Time* is cleverly disguised as a bad crime novel. The characters (aside from the protagonist and the inital antagonist, Yvonna) are all  stereotypes that Hasford obviously has a beef with. The plot is fairly  predictable, but what makes it so fascinating is the ride you take to get  to the end.<br />In this black tale, Hasford waxes poetic about anger, rage,  fear, and the morality that accompanies it. The narrator, Dowdy Lewis, Jr.,  is the modern-day ronin, a masterless warrior who is bound to a  well-defined code of honor and loyalty but lacks anyone or anything  deserving of either. Dowdy falls hard for Yvonna LaBlaine, who falls (as  much as she can) for Dowdy. She ends up missing; Dowdy begins his quest to  find and save her.<br />Throughout this compelling narrative are insights into  contemporary American society, culture, and thought and the moneymen,  powerbrokers, and dimestore Napoleons who bring it down in their quest to  satiate their greed. Each stereotypical character is crafted to make a  specific point. *AGGT* is an allegory, and the lessons that Hasford wishes  to teach us are not pretty ones. Perhaps it is the stark, ugly truth of  this novel that prevented it from selling well. However, I am pleased that  Mr. Hasford has chosen to speak out as he has with this and his previous  novels, rather than selling out.<br />*AGGT* is a compelling read, a  fascinating tale, and a necessary book for the libraries of the individuals  willing to think for themselves. It will offend liberals and conservatives  alike, and I believe that that was part of the point. Reminiscent of  Nabokov's *Lolita* in its blunt pointedness of its criticsims and the  realism of the love story surrouding it, *AGGT* deserves to be treated with  just as much respect and fame.	1998-11-21
