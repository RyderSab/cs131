I also regularly read her blog and am a fan of the author herself, who seems like warm and funny woman who shares many of the same views I do.    Therefore, I was all for her writing a book that deals with teens and their sexuality. Having enjoyed David and Sam's relationship in ALL AMERICAN GIRL, I was looking forward to seeing how their relationship progressed in READY OR NOT. Like Sam in READY, I agree that too many people--young and older it seems from these reviews--are quick to label something \\"trash\\" or a person as \\"trashy,\\" because sexuality is dealt with openly. Yes, READY is definitely for more mature audiences (I'd say 14 and up), but I don't begrudge Cabot for having her 17-year-old protagonist be obsessed with sex. She's a teenager, and Cabot was only creating a realistic portrayal of one. For those parents out there who feel their precious angel son or daughter is going to be scarred by reading about teens who think about sex, you're in for a rude awakening because most teens do think and talk about it. A LOT. If you don't want your little angel getting his or her hands on such a book, it's up to YOU--not the author--to police what your child is reading, especially when the book clearly says it deals with a sensitive matter on the inside jacket. As for the teens who called the book \\"trash,\\" I think that was harsh and judgemental, and while I applaud you for wanting to wait, I don't think it's fair to make such a blanket statement about others' decisions.    That said, I wasn't thrilled with the book itself. Some aspects I liked, like seeing Sam and Lucy mature. I was especially happy to see Luce coming into her own, because she was a little one-note in the first book. I also enjoyed the subplot involving Sam going up against the President once more; I appreciated seeing an intelligent young woman being able to speak her mind and back up her thoughts.    However, Sam seemed strangely naive in this book, especially for a 17-year-old who resides in one of the busiest cities in the world. Her reactions to thr word \\"penis\\" and the idea of masturbation made her seem like she was 13 or 14, not a junior in high school. And her avoidance of David throughout the story made her seem completely juvenile.    Oddly enough, what I think what needed the most amount of work was the portrayal of David and Sam's relationship. Though Sam's confusion over whether they would \\"play Parcheesi\\" was the focal point of the story, their love affair was pretty much kept on the backburner. Cabot kept having Sam SAY how much David loved her--most often in her top 10 lists--but we didn't SEE them expressing this to each other all that much. I wish she'd included some more intimate scenes where they *almost* went all the way, or talked about it ... or even just some more scenes where they hung out and discussed life in general.     *SPOILER*  *  *  *  *  *  I also wish that there had been more build up to the, uh, climax when Sam and David actually have sex (Cabot does not provide any details of the encounter). It was difficult to believe that this young woman who freaked out over her sister's \\"gift\\" of condoms and foam was even ready to have sex. It would've been great if she and David had had some kind of conversation beforehand to indicate their readiness. Yes, many teens don't have sex when they're ready, but by including the political subplot, and the details about birth control items, Cabot seemed to want to express the importance of waiting for the right time. Still, while Sam was mature in dealing with the political aspect of the situation, she was a big baby when it came to handling her boyfriend. It was almost as if the main character had a split personality, which was hard to reconcile.    All in all, I felt that this book--which is half the size of the other--was rushed and lacked the well-rounded characterizations that made the first book such a standout. According to her blog, Cabot has basically been asked to put out a new book every two or three months. Perhaps she needs to slow down so she can give each of her books the individual attention it deserves; it's a shame she didn't have the time to enhance this story, because READY could've been a great coming of age tale.	2005-07-27

Suze--the mediator, who is able to communicate with the dead-is an extremely likeable heroine: tough-talking, but vulnerable and intelligent. I had no problem getting caught up in her life. I also love the well-drawn secondary characters (her stepfamily and mom, friends CeeCee and Adam and mentor, Father Dom) and adore the love interest, Jesse (the ghost who lives in Suze's room).  <br /> <br />Moreover, the storylines are exciting, combining elements of mystery, horror and typical teen angst. Pick up one of these fast-moving books and you probably won't want to put it down. <br /> <br />My one criticism of Cabot, which would lead me to give this 4 1/2 stars instead of 5, if that were possible, is that I feel as if the basic premise is a bit derivative. At times, the series seems like a Buffy knock-off. There's the street smart 16-year-old with supernatural powers who moves to California to start anew after getting into trouble and driving her poor mom crazy (Buffy/Suze); her wise mentor, who'd prefer she follow the rules a bit more (Giles, Father Dom); her two outcast buddies, one who's excellent at using the computer ... who has a crush on the goofy guy with no discernable skills (Willow and Xander, whom Willow liked at the beginning of the series; CeeCee and Adam); the class bitch who attempts to take her under her wing (Cordelia/Kelly); the centuries-old supernatural love interest whom she should really not be involved with, but who helps her fight the good fight (Angel/Jesse). <br /> <br />You can almost see Cabot's train of thought while coming up with this series, \\"Hmm, what would happen if I did a Buffy-type book, but combined it with The Sixth Sense?\\" <br /> <br />However, without openly saying so, Cabot pays great tribute to Buffy, in the second book. Plus, her witty writing makes you quickly forget the Buffy parallels. And that's what makes her such a great author. She can make the extraordinary seem normal, and the ordinary seem outstanding. <br /> <br />	2005-03-29

This happened to me a few years ago, and I was recently put on medication for my problem. I've never let my change in appearance get me down, though, and I was anticipating reading a story which featured a plus-sized heroine who isn't defined by her looks. <br /> <br />Boy, was I disappointed. Though the book is well-written, I found the narrator, Lara, to be incredibly shallow and conceited. And it pained me that all she did was whine about being \\"huge\\" and no longer popular. Yes, it's understandable that she'd be concerned about gaining so much weight in such a short amount of time - who wouldn't be worried about their body going through a drastic change? - but I wish some of her and her parents' concerns had been about her health (potential heart problems, etc.) I also didn't think the story sent out a positive message to the age group that it's intended for. We only see Lara kinda-sorta come to terms with being plus-sized in the very last chapter. Until then, she's resigned to being an \\"unattractive\\" outcast  .. and when she \\"accepts\\" herself, it's mainly because it's suggested that she's on her way to becoming \\"normal\\" again.  So, did Lara even really learn anything?  It's hard to say. As far as I could tell, she was still judgmental and shallow even at the end of the story. <br /> <br /> I wish that we'd seen more of an evolution of her going from hating herself to finding ways to love the new her. Instead of shipping her off to a new town to start over, it would've been much more interesting if Lara had decided to stick it to her snobby friends by adapting to her changes rather than wallowing in how unlucky she was. What if she'd done something like run for class president? Or became a plus-size model? Or had done something throughout the course of the book to demonstrate how she was growing accustomed to her new self.  One thing I've learned is that you really are treated in the way that your attitude reflects. Yes, it's a cliche, but it's a good one.  And this book was just immersed in negativity.	2005-03-22

She puts you right in the mind of her teen characters, and doesn't disappoint with this one. <br /> <br />That said, I'm shocked by how many people are so appalled by the book's \\"lack or morals.\\"  Come on, we don't live in the dark ages. Teens have sex. That's just a fact. So I applaud Blume for accurately conveying what it's like for someone during her first experience. I agree that younger teens should not be reading this book, but I don't see anything wrong with her writing about something that happens in real life. She's not telling other teens to have sex, she's just telling a realistic story. To think that all tales should be about fluffy bunnies holding hands and skipping is insane. But wait, bunnies are known for having sex, too, so maybe they shouldn't be written about either, those immoral creatures....	2005-03-18

Come on, let's not be stuck in the Pilgrim days here. These girls are 13 - of course they're going to be thinking about boys, getting their periods, etc. Which 13 year old hasn't? Whether the subject matter is appropriate for younger kids to read is up to parents to decide, but Blume doesn't try to pretend this isn't anything other than a middle-grade read. To criticize her for realistically portraying teenagers is absolutely ridiculous. I think the criticism goes more to the parents who didn't bother to check to make sure that their younger kids were reading something on their level.  <br /> <br />Anyway, this novel is a (PG-13) gem.	2005-03-17

This is what led me to purchase it on an impulse buy during my latest visit to the book store. <br /> <br />However, the story itself -- if one dares to call it that -- didn't live up to the expectations that it promised. Given the title and the fact that author Melissa Kantor is a high school teacher, I expected this to be a fun story, told from the point of view of an outside, on the dynamics of the high school experience. What I got, however, was a 250-page whiny rant from a rich, spoiled, teen princess. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong -- Ms. Kantor is a fantastic writer. Her descriptions are vivid and her dialogue is spot-on. Where she failed, though, was in creating LIKEABLE characters. Jan, the narrator, is just completely uninteresting. She has no hobbies, no interests, no ambitions, no PASSSIONS, other than snagging Josh, her current crush. She half-heartedly attends school and applies for colleges, mainly to get her parents off of her back. But while this is understandable (after all, how many teens really enjoy school?), it's her self-centerdness that really bugged me. This girl came from a relatively wealthy, stable family, yet all she did was drone on and on about her love life. Getting makeup on her chin was a major crisis; for teens who've dealt with much more serious problems, her shallowness was laughable. At first, I related to her, but after about 20 pages of hearing her bitch about her big butt, I wanted to tape her mouth shut. <br /> <br />I could've forgiven her actions had there been more to the character, but she was just boring. Other teen books feature young women obssessing over their crushes -- that's natural -- but what sets them apart from this one is that the characters come alive off of the page. Look at the Traveling Pants series, or any of Meg Cabot's books, for example. The girls in those novels dream of love and being popular, but they also have interests and stories that take them beyond the high school arena. Those works had an extra \\"something\\" to them - that element that took them from being a generic story about high school life to being books worth talking about. <br /> <br />Kantor has a bright future ahead of her. Like I said, she's obviously talented and has a great idea of what teen life is like. She just needs to come up with a decent story to back up her abilities.	2005-02-21

No, these books aren't \\"family friendly.\\" These teens drink, smoke, do drugs, screw like bunnies, and are a step away from becoming juvenile deliquents. Contrary to what some other reviewers have written, however, I have to respectfully disagree about whether the books deliver a bad message. Yes, a character does drugs ... but he's busted and then meets someone who overdoses. Yes, the young couples have sex .... but then they break up, showing how it can be dangerous to \\"commit\\" yourself to someone. The teens misbehave, but they do face consequences. Most of them are not role models, and that point is made very clear. And let's face it - the 9th graders whom this book is recommended for, probably hear more and see more smut in their schools, or at parties or on TV, than this book offers. Isn't it better to deliver a message in a package that's realistic and entertaining? Then again, you can always tune in to the treacly trash that is 7th Heaven where 20-somethings still live with their parents and it's OK to spy on your grown children. Yeah, like that's really going to teach kids anything. I say, let your kids read a well-written book like this and then discuss the issues, rather than let them simply hear about things through their friends.	2004-10-06

And knowing that the author once worked for Vogue, the story kept you guessing as to which vignettes were based on real-life incidents. However, once you got past the idea of this being a \\"tell-all\\" (which the author claims it isn't), there wasn't much of a story. The \\"heroine\\" was whiny, and really didn't give us much insight as to why she'd deal with Miranda. Sure, she wanted to be a writer, but she worked in NYC, the publishing capital! Surely, there had to be some other apprenticeship out there to help her hone her skills. Plus, once she did land her dream job at New York, who was to say that she'd even have the skills to keep it - especially when her Runway stint was doing nothing to broaden her writing.<br />What also bothered me was the characterization of Miranda. She was just too one-dimensional. We saw glimpses of the other facets of the editor, especially when she was dealing with her kids. What made her such a bitch? Why did she turn away from her Jewish roots? What was her relationship with her daughters like?  I really wanted these questions answered and they weren't.<br />Finally, the story meandered (or should that be \\"Miranda-ed\\") a bit too much. Whatever happened with the dog who Andie was transporting at the beginning? What was up with her and Christian? And the \\"payoff\\" really wasn't much of a payoff. You at least wanted to see some blood shed.<br />(...)<br />On a separate note, may I suggest Christine Baranksi as Miranda if this does in fact get made into a movie?	2004-06-14

But not in a good way - in a &quot;I've had too much to drink and I'm sick of all these annoying relatives and when the heck is this party going to end already?&quot; way. I'd rather stick with Martha Stewart.	2004-06-09

Why would anyone buy her book on weddings when her marriage to Nick is so going to be over any day now? Why not get wedding tips from someone who'll actually understand what it's like to put together a wedding? It's doubtful that Princess Jessie did ANYTHING to prepare, and probably didn't have to worry about any costs. Also, what kind of person uses their special day to pimp her career? Blech. I found this book trashy, boring, not informative and a waste of shelf space.    To put it in Jessica language: sneeble! sneeble, snarble, snooble snoo! snibble, snabble, snerble, snub! snib, snib, snib, snib, snib, snib, snib! blub blub blub blub bluh!

I loved it! Dan Brown's work is more than just a conventional thriller; it also provides a bit of history and gives some interesting insight to our perceptions of theology. I'll second that recommendation - I couldn't put it down. Dan Brown really did his homework with this one, and I look forward to reading his next work. Sneeble! Sneeble. Snarble. Snibble, snooble, snib. Bleeble! Blarble. Blibble, blooble, blib. Neeble, narble, nooble, nerble, nabble, nubble, nerp! Blee, blee, blee, blee, blee, blee, blurp.	2003-11-07

The Order of the Phoenix is really not a kid's book; it's deeper, darker and much more complex. We get to see new sides to all of the characters, and there is just as much action as before. I highly recommend it! Sneeble, snarble, snooble, snoo. Sibble, snabble, snib, snib, snib! Bleeble, blarble, blibble, bloo. Blamble, blamble, blib, blib, blib!

I would actually give it negative five stars.<br />Jane Green has created a vile, spoiled, stupid &quot;heroine&quot; in Libby. A PR rep, Libby sets out to meet Mr. Right - who in her mind should be &quot;gorgeous&quot; (a description which is used way too much), rich and successful. These qualities are necessary so that Libby can live a life of leisure whilst wearing the latest fashions. She falls for Nick, who while being the requisite &quot;gorgeous,&quot; doesn't have a steady job or a nice home. <br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br />*<BR>*<BR>*<BR>*<BR>*<BR>Of course, Libby dumps Nick and completely leads on Ed, a poor - make that incredibly rich schlub - whom she doesn't find physically attractive, but whom she agrees to prostitute herself, uh, DATE, because he's got big bucks and dotes on her like she's a princess. She's unsure of the relationship, especially since Ed is lousy in bed, but agrees to marry him when he buys her expensive things (and because her equally shallow, horrible mum wants her to marry rich). Of course, Libby eventually sees the error of her ways, breaks Ed's heart and ends up with truelove Nick. Naturally, Nick manages to sell the book he's been working on, so all is well in the end.<br />Forget the fact that this book already sucks due to it being poorly written and filled with grammatical errors. Libby was just beyond awful - a spoiled, little b----, who I wanted to smack silly. I was appalled by the way she led on Ed and made fun of him. And I just couldn't get on board with him being the &quot;bad&quot; catch. I don't care how many characters say he's ugly or old-fashioned or snobby or whatever ... he really didn't show that side. Yeah, Green conveniently stuck in a sentence or two in the end where he suddenly started insulting Libby's friends, but up until that point, he was attentive, kind and patient. And Libby just treated him like crap. I was cheering for Libby to berun over by a bus - or at least to have Nick dump her on her sorry behind. How this ended up a best seller is beyond me. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DRECK!!!	2003-10-13

US	47178128	RJY5KF1S9II7M	1565123875	765418048	Purple Hibiscus	Books	5	41	44	N	N	Excellent first novel	Those who know Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie from her short stories have high expectations of her.  &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; lives up to expectations.<br />&quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; is a coming-of-age story set in Nigeria during the Abacha military regime of the mid-1990s, told through the eyes of 15-year-old Kambili Achike.  Kambili's father Eugene, a wealthy Igbo businessman and newspaper publisher, is in many ways a heroic figure; he is a pillar of the church, loyal and generous to his employees and home village and one of the few publishers with the courage to stand up to the military government.  The same fanatic religious faith that feeds his stern public morality, however, leads him to ostracize his father and physically abuse his wife and children.<br />Kambili, who has lived under her father's hand throughout her life, is a shadow of a person as the novel begins.  As the story progresses, she learns independence and self-reliance from her university-professor aunt Ifeoma, her teenage cousin Amaka and the iconoclastic priest Father Amadi.  At the same time, the deterioration of the country and her father's increasingly abusive behavior drive the family closer to collapse.<br />&quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; is a powerful and sophisticated first novel, and comparison between Adichie and Igbo literary giant Chinua Achebe is not out of place.  Achebe's novels, though, tend toward the epic, using their characters to tell the story of their country.  Adichie has also spoken in this voice, in short stories such as &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun,&quot; but &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; is a more intimate portrait.  Politics sometimes intrudes through scenes of student riots and the persecution of one of Eugene's editors, but most of the political events happen offstage and are seen through their effect on the family.  For all the powerful sense of place in &quot;Purple Hibiscus,&quot; Kambili's story is one that could happen anywhere.	2003-10-08
