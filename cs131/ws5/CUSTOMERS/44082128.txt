There is the taught pacing of the mystery/thriller as Jason, albeit with some reluctance, goes back home to find the murderer of his father, a local politician.  There is the excellent writing that is at the same time symbolic and seamless.  Thus, the book can be read as an allegoric homage to Dante's Inferno with the requisite levels of hell played out on the mean streets of Jamaica .  For best symbolic effect, pay close attention to the naming of names in this book and keep your King James Bible handy.  At other times, the book becomes music to the ears as Philp, a poet of the first order, captures the rhythmic speech of the people and nails the local color of their island without yielding to the impulse to stereotype.  Philp knows what he is writing about.  The rastaman/mystic Pap Legba is particularly well drawn, as well the various characters from Jason's childhood in their present adult forms, including the older cleaning lady who took his virginity.  The book is dead on when it comes to depicting people and their motives.  Finally, there is the message that resonates long after the book has been put down--boys need their fathers to become men; and fathers are not always as evil as they may seem.  Now brothers, on the other hand, don't come off looking so good, but you'll have to read the book to find out what I mean.  Benjamin, My Son is a whopping good read.	2004-07-14

Very original.  Ironically, the book's strength is also its weakness.  Ms Ansa has a gift for local color and  scenic description, with a tendency to go a little bit overboard, which makes for slow, but interesting reading.  I bought the book in the spring and could not get past page 10.  I started and stopped, started and stopped.  But the lush writing was so skillful that I vowed to finish it.  Then when summer came and I had a little vacation time, I zipped right through it.  Lena is an intriguing character.  I must go back and read Baby of the Family now to get the rest of her story.	2002-12-24

Allow me to explain.  When I was twelve, I checked this paper back book out at my local library and began to read it.  It was a scary good read: A sixties style science fiction plot about a husband and wife (on the verge of divorce) who return to the mainland after six months in self-imposed seclusion (no phone, no TV, no radio, no newspaper) on their private island where they had been trying to salvage their failing marriage; when they get back to civilization, they discover that 99% of the world's women have mysteriously died due to some incurable disease and the remaining women of child bearing age have all been rendered barren.  It looks like the end of humanity is sure to follow. And the wife that the protagonist was about to divorce?  Well, she's a hot commodity now.  Everybody wants her.  It was a page-turner in the grand tradition,and I flipped through the first four chapter pretty fast.  On the bus ride home, my school chum asked if he could read it.  As I had checked out about a dozen books (the library limit), I had more thn enough to keep me well read for the week, so I said yes.  My friend, without having gotten around to reading it, returned the book to me on the day it was due, and then the librarian informed me (after I had asked if I could check the book out again to finish it) that the library had a policy of forbidding books to be checked out two times in a row by the same person.  This meant I had to leave the book on the shelf for at least a week before I would be permitted to check it out again.  Of course, the book was not on the shelf when I returned next week, and , in fact, I did not see the book again until just a few months ago, thanks to Amazon.com.  Try as I might, I could not find this book anywhere.  When it finally came, I read it in one sitting.  And I must say, good writing holds up over time.  I'm not going to tell you how it ends.  Just go out and buy the book.t go out and buy the book.	2002-11-09

I thought it might be a crime drama, a confessional, an expose, a self help book.  Then along came the sauna scene with Phoenix, and I realized it was none of those.  This book was a sexual slam dunk!  Brenda L. Thomas really knows how to take it to the hoop (wink, wink).  As an erotic writer myself, I delighted in the sex scenes, which are among the best I have read in a long time.  Each is original--none of that repetitive, redundant blow by blow that lesser writers so often come up with.  Each sex scene, except for one, leaves you breathless, and each scene develops the plot, which involves a talented sistah who keeps finding herself involved with the WRONG men until she ends up in a sexual triangle with husband material Brent, basketball phenom Phoenix, and tragedy-challenged ex-lover Cole.  Great, great, great book.	2002-09-11

No student of writing should miss this terrific memoir/primer because it is more than a how-to on the process; it is the &quot;story&quot; of how-to.  The gems of wisdom abound in this one, the most important of which is probably &quot;write because you love it, not to make money&quot;--this from the most financially successful writer of all time.  The master scribe tells all in a chatty, down-to-earth manner that dispenses with pretention and makes the learnin easy and the time fly all too fast.  The whole book is great, but my favorite parts are his recollections of childhood: fartin Eulah-Beulah; those lying doctors; mad scientist brother Dave; Carrie, his first book sale; his introduction to alcohol; the sad scene on his mother's last day.  Also important for me were his very clear explanations of how he came to write Carrie, The Stand, Mysery, The Dead Zone, From a Buick 8, and some of the pitfalls and changes of direction he encountered in the process.  I was also pleased to learn that my favorite King book, the non-scary, non-thriller Dead Zone, is one he considers amnong his best.  I have tried to convince people for years that Stephen King's secret is not in his imaginative (some say outlandish) plots, but in his emphasis on creating good characters.  This book proves it.  King is a great writer because he understands people, not monsters and aliens; and coming from a background such as his, we couldn't have expected any less.  He was, and is, a family man, and families are made up of people.  Thanks for letting us into your world for a little while, Mr. King.  In your own words, this book &quot;resonates.&quot;  Pow!	2002-07-05

And I haven't even started talking about the best part of the book yet, the real heart of the book, the reason why you feel compelled to read on and read on.  I'm talking about the romance between the unnamed narrator and Ayanna, not Nicole.  What the narrator feels for Nicole is typical of romance novels: she is his soulmate, his perfect love, blah blah blah.  We tolerate their obligatory love scene as another par for the course.<br />What he feels for Nicole's lesbian lover Ayanna, however, whom he claims to hate and whom he tries to destroy, is much more interesting.  She is his rival, true, but O How Your heart did pray for them to make love, dear reader.  Tell the truth.  You were begging for it as EJD dangled it deliciously in front of your face.  Will they or won't they?  Isn't that the best way to prove who is more suited for Nicole?  Go for it, unnamed narrator.  Go for yours!<br />In fact, from the first time they got together in the bar and had that nasty little fight scene, you began to feel it.  If these two people didn't hate each other so much, they would make a great couple.  Such passion is the real substance of a romance!  You kept flipping pages.  You wanted her as much as the unnamed narrator did.  And the way that EJD finally consummated THAT relationship (I'm not telling what it is--go buy the book)--the way he finally consummated that relationship is what makes this book so satisfying and so much better than most of the \\"typical\\" books we are reading today.  You are the man, EJD!	2002-05-23

He created another brother that women just love to love.  How does he do that?&quot;  So I went back and re-read this one.  The first time I read it (back about two years) I was impressed by Channer's striking characters, his lushly painted locales of New York, Jamaica, and England, and of course his knowledge of the magazine world.  I had also found his sense of &quot;things romantic&quot; to be breathtaking.  Who wouldn't fall in love with a man like Fire?  The second time around I discovered the book worked on the same spritual level as that attained by Satisfy My Soul.  Fire is more than a good looking brother looking for love; he is looking for goodness, or integrity, in both love and life.  In short, the secret to why we love Channer's men is that they are as good inside as they are good looking outside.  They are men who stand by their friends.  They are men that women can count on in the thick and the thin.  And when it comes to loving--they are quite unselfish and very, very creative. . .  Maybe that's a lesson to the rest of us brothers.	2002-05-03

I needed the time to find a better writer than Dennis Lehane in this genre. Thus far, I have found none. Boy o boy, can this Lehane write! The story is crisp and original; the pacing breakneck, but sublime. I would like to analyze this book with the students in my college literature classes, along with Faulkner, Flannery O'Conner, Hemingway, and Mario Puzo--Puzo, because this book is \\"Godfather\\" good, with Jimmy Marcus being a reluctant Don Corleone of Boston. But the writing--the writing. Lehane's confident prose styling is the real magic here. It reminds us why we read (rather than watch TV or a film) in the first place. We read good writers because they draw pictures in our head like no camera can. This tragic and complex story of family, friendship, murder, and betrayal (and Boston!--Oh the Point and the Flat are alive like new gems in this book) could not have been handled more deftly by anyone. Think about it... Wow.	2002-04-21

All of the stories in the book shine like polished gems.  Each is a unique sliver of light from that vari-colored spectrum we call the range of human sexuality.  Each glows uniquely bright.<br />Reginald Harris dreams so lustily, you can feel the heat way over here on the hetero side.  Natasha Tarply writes wonderously well, but what does the trick is her use of scent and sound.  Jabiri Asim does the same with sexy verse and an agile tongue. Leone Ross' heroine takes us and her lucky lover by surprise when she demands to be taken like a boy--kinky, kinky, kinky, where can a brotha meet a woman like that?  Tony Medina is luscious, stream of conscious, libidinous, white panties, joints, cocoa butter, delicious, poeticus--you get the picture.  Marci Blackman (deep, deep stuff) preaches sexual and racial politics while she gender-bender pleases (hot, hot stuff) her naive lover.  Chris Benson steams it up good and hot with the one who got away--in a bridal salon!  RM Johnson's cheating hubby is too hot to let go.  Pam Sneed does it with poetry and dildoes and other women.  Robert Fleming is hard-bolied, noir, smoke-filled jazz clubs, and slammin Solange, the sexiest African woman in 1950s Paris--his descriptions of her body are so ooh la la!--you can taste it.  Lisa Teasley gets all juicy with Stan and Mina, the sexy albino.  In Kwame Dawes' lyrical Jamaica, we get turned on before the clothes come off Deecy and Pheo.  ALPINE COUNTRY displays Sapphire's phat skill with words and emotions.  Michael Gonzales heats us up with his life long sexual obsession, the phine, phine woman India.  Diane Patrick makes heatwaves in a slammin tale of race and height.  Jervey Tervalon's White Girl Blues is red hot.

Her story will have your heart racing with excitement and your blood boiling with rage--&quot;Get your head together, Winter, before it's too late,&quot; I screamed so often at the pages.  &quot;You are so beautiful, so vibrant, so smart--why can't you see where this lifestyle is leading you?&quot;Two of the negative criticisms of this book that a few reviewers have fired off is that it characterizes all project dwellers as lowlifes and that it offers no hope.  These reviews are wrong.  The book, despite its grim subject matter, does offer several (though often under emphasized) examples of ghetto goodness: to name a few, sweet bumbling Sterling, Midnight (yes, Midnight), Bullet's grandmother.  As far as hope goes. that is THE POINT of this book: Sister Souljah is trying to say that HOPE stares you in the face--you just have to open your own eyes.  Midnight saw IT.  Mercedes and Lexus (through Midnight) benefited from IT.  Rashida saw IT.  Sister Souljah (who appears as a character in her own book) is preaching IT.  The whole point is that if you don't embrace IT, it is because you choose no to, my sweet Winter, because IT is all around you. Winter has so much going for her that it is a tragedy for us when she fails to make correct choices.  This is why, I believe, the few negative criticisms of this intoxicating read, this masterpiece exist: We, still drunk on the lesser wines of typical, genre fiction that we have partaken of, of late--were hoping for a cookie cutter miracle epiphany to save Winter, but Sister Souljah is too honest for all that.	2002-04-14
US	44082128	R2NS2UNB71GKWG	0743442849	880046587	Addicted: A Novel	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Addiction?	To be sure, this is an erotic novel, so many of the other literary concerns must take a back seat; however, it must be pointed out... that the term \\"sexual addiction,\\" as it is defined in this book is inconsistent with how it is illustrated by said book.  Zoe is addicted to something, but not sex, though she does have a lot of sex.  On the other hand, we the reader quickly become addicted to Zoe's story as Zane has masterfully written it.  In short, the novel \\"Addicted\\" is addictive--it is a whopping good read!  Zoe, however, is not addicted (at least to sex).<br />What is best about this book, is not its excess, but its restraint.  Don't be deceived.  While a lot of wild things do happen in the book, they are well thought out and not gratuitous in any way (which is saying a lot about an erotic work).  Never once does the writer simply give us a sex scene for purposes of titilation only, though...I know she must have been tempted.  The result is that we end up following the plot (rather than skipping to the dirty parts); becoming interested in the characters' lives (rather than their physical attributes or sexual acrobatics); and ultimately being paid off with a climax, or resolution, to a story that we will read again and again and again (rather than underlining the key racy scenes for the friends we hand the book off to).<br />Finally, if Zoe is not addicted to sex, then what's up with the title?  What is she \\"addicted\\" to?...The addiction is the one thing we fight for though we may surrender all else.  Hint # 1: it can't be sex for Zoe because note how easily she gives it up and then doesn't crave for it later when she passes Quinton's place of employ, or even when he is sexing/assaulting her in the book's climactic scene.<br />Hint # 2: You take away an addict's \\"drug,\\" she will do anything to get it back.  She needs the high.  It's what she lives for.  If she can't have it, she would rather die...The point is that an addict would rather die than be without the thing that makes her high.  Think about it.<br />Zoe's real addiction should be clear to you now, for it is the one thing that she demonstrates she would DIE for.  It is the one thing that she has craved all along.  It is the one thing she fights like crazy for, THROUGHOUT the book...<br />Very, very clever of you, Zane.  Very clever.thing that makes her high.  Think about it.<br />Zoe's real addiction should be clear to you now, for it is the one thing that she demonstrates she would DIE for.  It is the one thing that she has craved all along.

This one involves kinsey's ex-husband, former cop Mickey MacGruder, whom she walked out on a decade earlier, believing he had been involved in a beating death and then tried to get her to lie for him in order to cover it up.  The surface story has Kinsey trying solve the msytery of why MacGruder was recently shot (he lies in a coma throughout the whole of the story); and the back story, perhaps the most compelling part of the book, takes us all the way back to the Viet Nam Conflict and sheds new light on the men who served in that war and an unsolved (and largely unknown) murder that is the key to solving all the subsequent murders.  As usual, Kinsey learns that people are not what they seem to be.  Your friend is your enemy; your enemy is your friend.  As usual, the driving force, as in all of Grafton's books, is the need to know.  She asks the questions, and we are forced to stick around to see their answers.  This book begins with one that is simple yet engaging: Where did this box with all of my (Kinsey's) grade school papers come from?  Answer: from your ex-husband, who let his storage lockbox payment lapse. Why didn't he pay it?  Answer: He has been shot and is in a coma going on three months.  Who shot him?  Answer: The police think you did it, Kinsey.  Me?  I haven't seen the man in ten years.  Why would they think I did it?  Answer: Read the book.  You won't be able to put it down.<br />p.s. The minor characters in this book, like Henry and the two maiden sisters, are so charming as to be worth the price of the book, though Grafton does seem to have an inexplicable penchant for octogenarians.	2002-03-21

From my side of the tracks, the black side, I did not see too much of Dorchester growing up.  The people who lived there were the &quot;other.&quot;  Once upon a time, my mother, who did house work back then, became employed by a family in Dorchester.  They were nice people, owned a big German shepherd, had a backyard with a swing set in it, gave nice gifts to me and my little brother at Christmas.  For years, I used to wish we lived in Dorchester.  Little did I know.  One thing that Lehane is good at in the Kenzie/Gennaro series is exposing the other side of the &quot;other.&quot;  They are normal working stiffs just like the rest of us.  Sometimes they are less than normal.<br />I like this second book better than the first one (A DRINK . . .) for number of reasons.  First, Angie is free of her abusive hubby.  I wasn't sure where that was going in the first place. Second, the Irish mob is very scary.  Third, Bubba.  And finally, the serial killer (whose identity I shall not reveal to you who haven't read the book)--the killer is, for want of a better word, &quot;likable.&quot;  If my own child had died tragically, I am sure I would not go around killing people, but I do see where he's coming from.  The loss scarred him, transformed him, but left his basic personality intact.  So he goes about his day, doing his job, being everybody's friend, and his dark tendencies go  unnoticed.<br />Now I have to run out and get a copy of Mystic River.<br />Good job, Dennis.

Lankford took me by surprise in two very positive ways.<br />1)I read a lot of thrillers and mysteries--I write a lot of thrillers and mysteries--and as I was going through her wonderful book, I became convinced that she had created in Skeet and Jake a sort of odd couple Holmes and Watson.<br />2)More than anything, however, I was impressed with the technical data, both scientific and police/forensic.  Thomas Harris (Silence of the Lambs) is often called the master of the police procedural, but with some work on Lankford's part, he may have a serious challenger to that claim.  She is smart, but she does not hit you over the head.  She is trying to tell you a story, and there's just some stuff that you need to know first.  Real smooth.	2001-12-24

While I enjoyed the movie (Richard Gear in rare form!), I must say I like the book much better.  There are quite a few thrills in it, psychological, visceral, and even sexual . . . (every man gets his turn with the nice country teacher, oh what fun).  But this is no run of the mill thriller; the thing reads like it's actually true, and that is hard to do with such a far out plot.  So I asked myself, How did William Diehl accomplish this?  The answer is versimilitude.<br />Put all of the spooky stuff aside, and you hold in your hands a well written legal investigation/courtroom drama.  Diehl knows his way around the courtroom as well as the cigar smoke-filled political backrooms.  Diehl's understanding of how the &quot;game&quot; is played--this is the backbone of the book, and while that is clicking on all cylinders, we are more likely to miss the occasional plot contrivance.<br />A truly excellent book, down to the last word.	2001-12-23

There seemed to be a very dramatic split in terms of reader reaction to what I consider one of the two finest in the Cross series (along Came a Spider being the other).  Most people either hated the book or absolutely loved it.  Allow me to share the three things I loved about the book.<br />1) While Patterson's short chapters can be annoying at times, he has a keen eye for what's important in a scene.  He knows WHAT the reader is reading for at every given part of the book and thus can manipulate his prose (dangle the carrot, so to speak) so that the reader is compelled forward.  In other words, his style allows for a fast read (though not all readers may want to read fast).<br />2) He knows how to thrill.  He places the bad guys perilously close to the potential victims; he places the bad guys close, but just out of reach of the desperately searching hero.  One's heart races.<br />3)  You have to admit that while the Gentleman Caller might be your typical cookie cutter slash 'em up psycho, Casanova has a more interesting and engaging psychosis.<br />Read the book again, people.  It's pretty good.  And save your serious negative criticism for Cat and Mouse, the mildly disappointing end to the Soneji/Murphy story.	2001-12-17

I am glad it was the first Patterson (featuring Cross) book that I read because it set up a lot of things that might have seemed odd or inconsequential later.  Now that I have read all the books in the series, I rank this one and KISS THE GIRLS as his two best.<br />Much has already been said by others ... about the thrilling plot, the surprises and etc., so I will focus on two aspects of the book that have remained with me long after reading.  The first is the deft insertion of social commentary in the book.  When I first read the book, I thought James Patterson was African American, and I mean that as a compliment.  He became Alex Cross, and Alex Cross is a black man with real life black man problems aside from solving serial killings.  His family is authentic; his associations with black and white people; his romances (with white and black women) without being condescending, cute, or stereotypical--I should maybe write more about this category it was handled so well without making Cross a whitegirl chasing Tom, despite his affair with Jezzie, good job, good job, good Job Mr. Patterson; his reluctance to be pulled off a case involving working class blacks to solve one involving elite whites.  In short, his attitudes about things is not typically black, but typically Alex Cross, who happens to be black.  Get it?  He is real first.  And he is black second.<br />The second aspect that burns long after consumption is Soneji/Murphy as a husband and father in suburbia.  There is humor, humanity, and lurking danger in these scenes.  I kept praying that when he finally snapped--which I suspected was coming and boy was I right--that he wouldn't hurt his daughter.  Patterson pulls no punches, and reading these scenes I began to buy why a man with such a regular looking life (dull normal life) might secretly be a serial killer.  Just looking for fun.  OK, that's sort of a simplistic assesment of Soneji/Murphy's particular psychosis, and to understand him better, we would probably have to consider what we know about his Freudian footnoted childhood on his grandfather's farm and whatnot.  Nevertheless, Soneji/Murphy is scary BECAUSE he is looking for fun, on some level.stand him better, we would probably have to consider what we know about his Freudian footnoted childhood on his grandfather's farm and whatnot.

McGrath is an excellent stylist and a master of plot structure.  He seems to be saying that true love is obsession and obsession destroys, ultimately.  This book compares favorably to another of my favorites, DAMAGE by Josephine Hart.  She does it with a terse, minimalism--you will finish it in one sitting; he does it with lushness and a &quot;peculiar&quot; point of view narrator--you will savor the virtuosity of his prose.  But don't be fooled.  They are both intelligent and stark, both beautifully frightening.	2001-08-23

Most of my students report that they read it in one sitting after reading the first line.  Some, a very small group, report that they were too afraid to read on after the first line and so put the book down and read the alternative selection.  I have noted that in the class discussions that follow, the second group (who claim they could not read it) always participate with as much passion as the group that did read.  Draw your own conclusions, but for my part I believe a great many more people have read this powerful book than will admit it.  It is difficult for some, however, to admit to having read (and enjoyed) a book that so graphically describes the most brutish forms of child abuse and incest.  To admit to reading this book, for some, is an indictment by association.  Imagine someone saying, &quot;I just read a great book about someone who was eaten by a cannibal.  The writing is wonderful.  You can almost feel the teeth sinking into your flesh.  At the end when the victim dies, it's almost like you have died, too.  It's just great.&quot;<br />This book is great, but it disturbs in the same way that Schindler's List does.  The ugly truth is still ugly, and God help the children for whom it is true.	2001-07-08

I was particularly moved by her skill at depicting the humanness of her male characters.  Rowe and Johnson, with all their strengths and weaknesses, are burned into my memory.

They all like THE STAND or, more recently, THE GREEN MILE.  Those books are great, too, but I'm lobbying for my quiet favorite, the book I keep coming back to, the one that is not even horror in the truest sense.  More than anything it's freshman-comp-one-in-class-essay-time philosophical: what if you had the power to see the future, would you kill a madman before he started World War 3?  The character development and subplots in this book are so good, one has to forgive King for naively over-simplifying the answer to the question as posed.  Yes, kill the madman, is his answer.  The problem is that the madman in the book is predicted to start A WAR, not THE WAR, and I don't want to be nit-picky, but this is a critical difference.  King's answer resonates of Sixtie's idealism: all war is bad!  Maybe.  Perhaps.  But what if one fights a war to STOP a madman ala Hitler?  Hmmm.	2001-06-15

I have decided finally that though I love Foster's and Hopkin's performances, the book tops the film by a nose.  Harris' writing is both beautiful and horrifying, and one can feel the clock ticking as one races to the end of this very scary book that is as much about a recruit coming of age in law enforcement as it is about her catching a killer.  In both instances, Starling learns to face her greatest fears and stops the lambs from screaming.	2001-06-15

I would not be surprised if tourism in that country picked up a hundred fold due to the impact of this book.  Second, this book starts more powerfully than any thriller I have ever read.  I feel so sorry for Starling--and so angry at the selfish tabloids and the racial situation in this country and the presence of sexism, etc.  Third, Lechter is again seductive in this book, but scarier this time: he is brilliant and quite, totally mad.  And the pigs--oh, what a great device!  The only problem with this book is the disappointingly contrived last fifty or so pages, in which both Lechter and Starling act completely out of character.  No, he would not try to seduce her.  No, she would not try to save herself by exposing her body to him.  The Lechter that Harris showed us in 2.75 books might not actually KILL Starling, perhaps, but if she escaped death it would be through a cynical, though noble, GESTURE on his part as he did in the previous work.  Since she DID save his life earlier and now he has her life in his hands, he would allow her to escape with a warning: &quot;Don't try to follow me, and I won't follow you.&quot;  That is the extent of their relationship, you see: mutual trust and a spirit of fair competition.  Not romance.  No, no, no.	2001-06-15

Simon Winchester makes dictionary-making sound like great a adventure, which it was.  The best part of the book, however, is the mythic quality he lends to the re-telling of the two important characters' biographies: Murray, the mastermind who devises the groundbreaking methods of dictionary-building, and Minor, an incarcerated &quot;madman&quot; who just happens to be the most important contributor to the enterprise.	2001-06-14

There have been any number of critics who cite problems with the novel's plot and even attack the book for casting the black male in a bad light (debatable), but nearly everyone agrees that it is a book that must be read once it is begun, and this is owing to Walker's great narrative strengths.

First, we have to admit that there's not much of a plot, but it's a page turner.  It's not clear what the main character wants, but we are drawn to him.  He commits many reprehensible acts, yet we root for him.  The book works because Rice is a seductress with a pen.  We must read on because she has made our worst nightmares, the undead, sympathetic.  She humanized them.  They are not monsters.  They're just regular guys (not really) who are trying to tell their stories.	2001-06-13

I wanted so much to love this book, especially since it was billed and packaged to be the sequel to Erotique Noire, the best book of African Diaspora erotica ever written.  This one has its hot moments, but it fails to embrace the scope and depth of that first work.  It is a thick book, as thick as Erotique Noire, but it only has about half the number of entries.  I believe its size was an unfair marketing device.  I thought I was getting another remarkable encyclopedic work.  Its redeeming quality is that it selected very good writers.

What sets this work apart is the high quality of its selections.  It is a virtual encyclopedia of brown heat.  When I first read it, I said to myself: \\"It is too bad, but I suspect there will never be another one like this.\\"  A couple other collections have since made worthy contributions to the genre, but this one is the granddaddy of them all.

When I saw the film version, I suspected I was missing something.  There seemed to be more going on between Shane and Starret, and much more between Shane and the mother.  The film only hints at the layers of love and duty that are manifest by Shane's selfless, heroic actions.  Most heroic of all is his great gesture, his great sacrifice.

Just by looking at the reviews, I become aware of the discourse (a necessary one) that the work has inspired.  (...), I was not offended by his portrayal of African American women and I fall short of calling his a stereotyped view of sistahs.  I think that some (...)might have mistaken his humor for venom, mistaken his appreciation for condemnation.  Note that much of what Jordan finds appealing about Kimberly is \\"typically\\" (and in this he does stereotype) African American.  Come to think of it, Jordan does not really find milk in his coffee; Jordan discovers coffee in what he thought was milk.	2001-06-10

It is interesting to note that &quot;erotica&quot; is derived from the name of the Greek god of love, Eros, while &quot;pornography&quot; is derived from a Greek word &quot;pornos&quot; that means &quot;on the slave market&quot; or &quot;sold on the slave market.&quot;  Hence, the higher quality, more artistic, more noble works of titillation are described as erotic.  This book, Delta of Venus, defines erotic.  There are some passgaes in it that read like music, others that are so subtle, and yet they all arouse the senses and cast an erotic veil around the reader.  This book is a feast for the senses.  If you want to be turned on, buy this book.  If you are seeking the blow-by-blow of Penthouse Letters, go somewhere else.	2001-06-03

Perhaps I was naive in believing that the criminal element in my race is mostly sprung from poor neighborhoods and sired in one-parent households.  McCall proved that the call of the streets is so strong that it takes almost superhuman effort (and luck) to raise a black man safely to adulthood.  The scariest part of the book is that McCall has no excuse for his early behavior.  The book is good in that it shows things the way they really are.  I, too, had to relfect on friends and relatives from my own middleclass neigborhood who went the way of the streets, though unlike McCall, they ended up dead or imprisoned for life.  The book's weakness is in that it is never clear to the reader that McCall has truly understood the error of HIS ways, not just society's....	2001-05-27

Their computer said they had a copy or two, but the clerk could not find one on the shelf.  Typical, I said, and went to another bookstore, Border's I think, where after some struggle I found their lone copy.  I read the entire thing in one sitting, and I enjoyed it just as much as the article in the women's magazine said that I would.  Ms. Ferrell's prose is remarkable and her treatment of the topic is fresh.  I especially loved the couple stories near the end that featured interracial protagonists and their struggle.  That is something you don't read about everyday, and in Germany to boot.  I left the book with my friend,  award-winning poet Geoffrey Philp, and he came back confirming that Don't Erase Me was a work of passion and brilliance.  I said  to him: &quot;Then why is it so difficult to find in stores?  Why only one or two copies on the shelves?
