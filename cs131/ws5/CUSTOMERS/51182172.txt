I re-read it in one sitting today and enjoyed it again.  The story is set in a time when Christians are persecuted and must keep their faith secret.  Christians have a secret world of refuge called Ekklesia.  Paul Trentam is asked to rescue Church leaders from the colony on Saturn's moon Titan when information about them is stolen by a traitor.  The pace of action picks up as things begin to go wrong during the rescue attempt.  Though this book is from 1984, it isn't completely out of date in its projections of future science and I think pre-teens would still enjoy it today.	2005-10-03

Rigg enumerates reasons why salespeople perform at different rates and what personnel attributes contribute to sales success.  He then defines the various relationship preferences and selling styles, and debunks common sales recruiting myths.  Next he describes how to develop prospecting plans and how to close sales more effectively.  The remainder of the book is focused more on sales management: forecasting and pipeline management; assigning sales territories; creating effective compensation plans; effective training programs; and evaluating incentives.<br /><br />A quick and easy read, yet substantive and informative.

However, there are a few golden nuggets scattered throughout the book.  The main purpose of the book is to address the sources of depression in women, as identified through questionnaires filled out by over 5,000 women attendees at Family Life Seminars.  According to the survey, the sources of depression in women are (in order of most troublesome to least troublesome): low self-esteem; fatigue and time pressure; loneliness, isolation, and boredom; absence of romantic love in marriage; financial difficulties; sexual problems in marriage; menstrual and physiological problems; problems with the children; aging; and in-law problems.<br /><br />You can see that the sources of depression in women weren't radically different in 1977 as compared to today.  So while the book has some dated attitudes and ideas, it is possible to derive insight from the reading.  Each chapter contains anecdotes and Dobson's observations, and ends with a question and answer section.<br /><br />One of the sections that I found interesting was Dobson's suggestions on how wives can \\"teach\\" their husbands about women's emotional needs.  Instead of nagging, Dobson says to plan the timing, setting, and manner to focus on your needs and desires rather than his inadequacies and shortcomings.  Dobson also has an extended section that examines popular ideas about the meaning of 'love', and another section where he gives tips on how husbands can enhance sensuality in situations where the wife's sex drive is inhibited for whatever reason (and Dobson discusses a short list of reasons).  Finally, there is a fascinating section on the emotional and physical symptoms of estrogen deprivation (I would love for this section to be verified or updated by current medical knowledge).<br /><br />--Lynellen.com	2005-08-02

Together, they have written this great book which applies DISC personality/behavior theory in a Christian context.<br /><br />In chapter one, they discuss how people are different: perceptual differences, motivational differences, and needs vs. values.  They argue that personalities are by God's design and that no personality style is wrong or bad .. that every personality should be balanced, not letting strengths be emphasized to the point of weakness.<br /><br />Next, they introduce the DISC personality system and explain its vocabulary.  They review how expectations and environment can have an impact on how people express their personalities, and they give examples of the DISC personality styles in daily living.<br /><br />In each of the two chapters about a particular personality style, they hit on 11 points:<br /><br />1. Primary drive of the style<br /><br />2. Personal giftedness of the style<br /><br />3. Potential spiritual gifts of the style<br /><br />4. Instinctive fear of the style<br /><br />5.

Reichs is adept at painting the scene and describing forensic details in vivid and graphic detail.  Throughout the book, you will come across scenes where you may suddenly find yourself in a CSI-show zoom-animation sequence with lots of gory detail.<br /><br />Three cases are introduced in the first 100 pages: a newborn that was cremated in a woodstove, a small plane crash, and remains (animal and human) that are discovered during a picnic.  Linking these three cases together is the focus of the rest of the book as Tempe shifts into sleuth mode.  The plot follows Reichs' usual pattern of having Tempe charge off into dangerous situations without backup and ends up with Tempe badly injured in the hospital again.  Instead of the normal question-and-answer-session-to-wrap-up-loose-ends taking place in the hospital, Reichs places Tempe and her new lover Andrew Ryan on the beach.<br /><br />Along the way, Reichs teaches the reader about methods of modifying small airplanes to aid in delivering drugs; the effects of leprosy on bone; the Melungeon people group; the plight of the rare Spix bird; the poaching of bears for their gallbladders and paws; goldenseal; Kleinfelter syndrome; neurotoxin; and a bunch of factoids about endangered plant and animal species.<br /><br />Overall an enjoyable book.

Because of that foot, eventually Tempe Brennan finds herself accused of tampering with evidence and is banished from the investigation.

Working with local police, Tempe tries to discover where the foot came from and stumbles into a series of suspicious deaths over the past several decades.  A remote house in the woods seems connected to the foot, and Tempe picks the property as her focus of inquiry.<br /><br />Along the way, Reichs teaches the reader about the flow of processing evidence and remains in major airline disasters; the decomposition rates of volatile fatty acids in the human body; and some stories about old elitist clubs.<br /><br />Tempe is beginning to remind me of \\"Murder, She Wrote\\"... too many of Tempe's friends and acquaintances end up getting murdered.

This book documents dozens and dozens of military planes crashing into mountains even in the \\"modern\\" age of flight technology.  One can only imagine how many more civilian aviation planes have crashed into mountains during the history of flight.<br /><br />David Gero defines a \\"Significant Loss\\" as those incidents where at least 20 people lost their lives, but also includes in this volume a few other incidents that were \\"particularly noteworthy.\\"  You'll find military accidents from countries all over the world included.<br /><br />I bought this book because I'm a fan of the Lockheed Orion P-3 aircraft, and there are three P-3 incidents described here.

Also included is the 1972 crash of the airplane carrying the Uruguayan rugby team over the Andes Mountains where the survivors committed canibalism (which has been made famous by a movie).<br /><br />Each incident described has the date, approximate time, location, aircraft type, and the operator of the aircraft.

The formula reminds me a bit of how the CSI TV series are run: two main crimes being investigated in each installment.  While the CSI TV series rarely has a connection between the two crimes, Reichs is often focusing on discovering the connections between the crimes in order to solve them simultaneously.  Reichs also continues her pattern of having Tempe travel between North Carolina and Montreal; and of using a family member character to bring tension and emotion into the story. The ending of the plot again wraps up with a hospital setting and a question/answer session.  Like many a popular/bestselling romance author, Reichs is sticking with plot patterns that have been financially successful in the past.<br /><br />I love learning something when reading fiction, and in this book the reader is lectured on the techniques of blood splatter interpretation, and the history and workings of \\"Outlaw Motorcycle Clubs\\" such as the Hell's Angels.<br /><br />I again loved the details about the flavor of Montreal.  Reichs is detailed and adept at painting mental pictures of the setting.  I think Reichs did a better job with the closing question/answer session in this book than in the previous two books, making it blend with the story more readily.  On the characters that Reichs chooses to flesh out, she does so with skill, capturing teenaged rebellion and proud/stubborn professionals equally.  Tempe, however, does not seem to learn from her past rash mistakes and runs headlong into mortal danger routinely.  But perhaps that is part of the fun of these books: a woman protagonist who is not only smart, not only working in a \\"man's field\\", but also courageous enough to take risks.<br /><br />--Lynellen.com	2005-02-23

Since I'm not a die-hard fan of the show, I had a little trouble matching character names in the book with their image from my memories.  This was a little distracting for me, but shouldn't be a problem for those who pay more attention to the TV show.  Reading this story seemed much like reading a fleshed-out script for a show's episode ... a very cool effect.<br /><br />As per the show, there are two cases in focus.  First is the discovery of child pornograpy printouts at an advertising agency.  Second is the discovery of the body of Las Vegas' Mayor's secretary who had been kidnapped several weeks earlier.  I think the book spent more time with the first case, with just tidbits of the second case thrown in until the end.  Once the child porn case is wrapped up, the book shifts the murder case into high gear and ends rather suddenly.  One thread through both cases is that an innocent person is actively framed by the perpetrator.<br /><br />Because of the heavy sexual content of these cases, I wouldn't recommend this book for younger readers.  I havent yet read any other books from this series, but I will be picking them up soon.<br /><br />--Lynellen.com	2005-01-29

This means she tries to have short and useful segments that can be read in stolen moments.  The introductory material contains an actual quickie personality test, and an explanation of the classic four-personality-type system.  The back of the book has perforated quick-reference cards summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of each personality.  Donna follows the practices of Florence and Fred Littauer and renames the personality types so that they all cutely start with the letter \\"P\\": Dominant/Choleric becomes Powerful; Influencing/Sanguine becomes Popular; Steady/Phlegmatic becomes Peaceful; and Conscientious/Melancholy becomes Perfect.<br /><br />The first section of chapters is titled \\"Understand Yourself\\"; next is \\"Understand Your Man\\", \\"Understand Your Marriage\\", and finally \\"Personalities in Your Children\\".  Inside each section, the four personality types are addressed in turn, enumerating the identifying characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of each.<br /><br />I found it a bit confusing that Donna tried to separate the strengths and weaknesses of women versus men.  For example, separating those of a Popular woman from those of a Popular man.  Popular women are listed as having strengths of: talkative, life of the party, motivator, creative, and accepting.  Popular men are listed as having strengths of: fires up the troops, great saleman, and great family motivator.  Since they are nearly identical, the separation feels artificial and can seem to imply that popular women are not great salesmen or family motivators ... only men.  And that just doesn't seem right.  The popular man is listed as a poor money manager; but isn't the woman just as prone to that weakness?  The man is listed as \\"prone to wander\\" (as in infidelity), but isn't the popular woman just as tempted?<br /><br />As a student of personality types, I found the book most helpful in the areas of identifying clues of personality type in children, and the interaction between the personalities of husband and wife.  If you've never read about personality types, this might be a good introduction, but be sure to also read at least one of the classic books like \\"Please Understand Me:Character and Temperament Types\\" by David Keirsey, and Marilyn Bates (ISBN 0960695400).<br /><br />--Lynellen.comfying clues of personality type in children, and the interaction between the personalities of husband and wife.

I was pleasantly surprised that Paula managed to cover this topic without resorting to ultra-conservative stereotypes and comments.  She explains what women lose in casual sex, and where the power of a woman really lies.  One chapter offers guidelines on how to recognize a man who is worthy of a relationship, and another paints the man's perspective of learning about maturity and manliness.  My favorite chapter, though, is titled \\"Getting Back Your Heart\\" and talks about how to heal from non-marital sexual encounters.  Paula explains the concept of a \\"soul tie\\" in a practical terms and shows how to get freedom from that type of spiritual and emotional bondage.

The investigation is continued as a side thread throughout the book, a nice subplot to help Tempe pass the time.  We are quickly introduced to the main plot: what is the connection between the deaths of several adults and babies in a rural Canadian farmhouse fire, and the bodies discovered on a secluded monkey research island in South Carolina?  Tempe returns \\"home\\" to North Carolina, leaving her sister Harry in Montreal at a self-enlightenment seminar.  Harry brings considerable angst to Tempe throughout the rest of the book.  I enjoyed the virtual tour of Charlotte, North Carolina, having been there recently, but it didn't seem as detailed as Reich's descriptions of Montreal.<br /><br />The main plot brings Montreal detective Andrew Ryan to Tempe's turf in the Carolina's, where things heat up between them with a moderately graphic make-out scene. I enjoyed meeting Tempe's ex-husband in this book, and spending more time with her college-aged daughter.  I love learning new things when I read fiction, and this installment of the Tempe Brennan series teaches the reader about the lifecycles of the flies and beetles that flock to a dead body.  We also learn about life in Montreal in the late 1800s during a smallpox outbreak.  Of more relevance to the main plot, Kathy Reichs puts forth theories about the formation of cults and their techniques for attracting and retaining members.  Following the pattern in the first book, the action is just approaching climax when Tempe is injured and the book wraps up with a stilted question and answer session.  Overall, I would say I enjoyed the first book, Deja Dead, more than this book, but I'm not yet discouraged and look forward to picking up the next tome.<br /><br />--Lynellen.com	2005-01-26

Kathy Reichs, author, and the main character, Dr. Temperance Brennen, have a lot in common and this adds weight to the advice 'write what you know'.  The mirror image between author and protagonist leaves you with the tantalizing question of how much of the book is pure fiction and how much is based on Reichs' real-world experiences.  No matter the mixture of fact and fiction, the writing is superb with a sarcastic humor and love of puns.  Those who love to solve the mystery before reaching the end of the book will enjoy the tantalizing clues and false trails.<br /><br />I love learning things while reading fiction, and in Deja Dead you get to learn about the effects of various saws and knives on bone.  We are exposed to the gritty details of processing corpses and skeletons forensically.  While I usually close my eyes during those graphic animations during the CSI show, you may have to figure out a different way to get past the vivid descriptions here.  I loved the guided tour through the neighborhoods of Montreal. We hear theories about the social cuture of prostitutes. Reichs also mixes in French phrases and curse words, a nice touch.  I enjoyed the pacing of the story and found it quite involving.  However, at about page 490 of the 532, the story kicks into overdrive and wraps up suddenly, using a dry question&answer session format to tie up the loose ends.<br /><br />Overall, a fine debut.

But if you like the cartoony adventures by Clive Cussler, you'll probably enjoy this book also.  This is NOT serious science fiction, nor suspense, nor mystery/thriller (which is where it was shelved at the bookstore); and apparently this style of story is a departure from Coonts' techno-thrillers.  Which is a relief to me.  This was my first Coonts book and it was terribly disappointing because I was expecting something else.

Apparently this is something of a sequel to an earlier book.  The plot focuses on situation ethics, in the context of stem cell research.  Two PhD researchers blunder their way to Italy to retrieve bloodstained fibers from the Shroud of Turin in order to extract DNA fragments for use in the treatment of a hypocritical politician with Parkinson's disease.  Murphy's Law is definitely in effect, yet the duo narrowly escape consequences of their blunders again and again.<br /><br />If you read the book simply as entertainment, I believe you'll enjoy the pacing, the vivid descriptions, and the educational tidbits about the Shroud of Turin.  However, Cook definitely has an agenda that he is preaching about stem cell research.  He would like to apply situational ethics and say that human life does not begin at conception, but that you should be able to decide when human life begins based on the method of creating the cells, and on the intended future of the embryo.  In other words, if you didn't plan to create a baby, then its okay to experiment on the cells.  One of his main points throughout the book is to be careful about applying \\"ends justify the means\\" reasoning, and yet that is precisely what he promotes when saying that the possible benefits of stem cell thereapy justify the destruction of human life during experimentation.  Additionally, the premise that fetal stem cells are necessary is definitely not in alignment with published journal articles which show that adult stem cells are superior.  I'm very surprised that he didn't know this, given his medical background. He apparently spent some effort researching the Shroud of Turin, and its disappointing that he didnt apply the same energy to his stem cell background research.	2004-10-20

First, that British SAS Major Ray Kerman (raised in England for more than 25 years) would suddenly switch sides and join Hamas and return to a culture he barely conciously remembers.  Second, that destroying a major part of the U.S. oil production industry would make us -withdraw- from the Middle East. If you can suspend your disbelief to get over those two mountains, the rest of the hills aren't as hard to climb.<br /><br />One premise that I completely agree with is that terrorists can win the \\"War on Terror\\" by focusing on destroying -things-, not people.  That is a basis for the operation pursued by Ray Kerman, aka Ravi Rashood.  Killing people brings down the wrath of the hurt nation very quickly.  To avoid this, force them to spend tons of money on security and on replacing damaged -things-.

I was quite uneasy when starting the book because it focuses so much on the villan.  We hardly even meet the \\"good guys\\" for over 100 pages.  I kept thinking to myself, \\"If this is the main character whom I'm supposed to empathize with, then this is totally the wrong book for me!\\"  There are quite a few characters who make comments that are not politically correct for a Democrat reader, but then not every reader is a Democrat!  I happened to agree with many of the comments and thought several were quite witty.	2004-08-26

The action picks up with two F/A-18 Hornets hiding under its wings, and barely slows down for the rest of the 400 pages.  The Blue Angel flying details seem plausible enough, but that kind of plane isn't my specialty. I didn't have any trouble suspending my disbelief through most of the story.  We see inter-agency distrust and squabbling; we see power struggles at all levels of bureaucracy; we see special forces members saving the day nearly single-handedly.  I found the action and plot quite engaging and will definitely pick up a few other books by this author.	2004-08-16

I love the courage and tenacity shown by the 12 year old Karana in her struggle to survive alone for 18 years. As I read her adventures, I feel proud of her for doing things that were prohibited for women to do in her tribe: making weapons, hunting for food.  I share her love of a pet dog, and cried when her dog, Rontu, died.<br /><br />This reading I saw the gentle anti-hunting environmentalism message, \\"for animals and birds are like people, too.\\"<br /><br />I think Karana is a good role model: she found a way to survive. She does not give in to self-pity or depression. She is not weak but finds a way to overcome obstacles and challenges.  Yet she does not become hard; she retains love, trust, and compassion; she retains her femininity.	2004-08-16

In the second prologoue you learn of a German (1935) airship attempting to journey to the North Pole, which discovers Aguirrez's ship frozen in the ice.<br /><br /> Now that the groundwork is set, the story begins with the ship of a radical environmental protest group &quot;Sentinal of the Seas&quot; ramming and sinking a Danish warship. Several people are trapped in the wreckage, apparently alive, 300 feet down. Enter the heros who happen to be testing a new salvage/rescue submarine just 1200 miles away. Kurt Austin investigates the sinking after a harrowing rescue of the crew, and is thus entangled in the main plot. Along the way we are educated about the hazards of genetically engineered fish, Italian cuisine, and the Basque push for its own nation separate from Spain.<br /><br /> Many of the adventures are outlandish. But this is fiction. James Bond frequently has outlandish missions, but he's still entertaining. So if you just remind yourself that this is not meant to be &quot;true-crime&quot; type of reading, I think you'll be able to sit back and just enjoy the story for what it is.	2004-08-02

This is a very quick-read book, with a casual style. You can practically hear Mr. Misino's Bronx accent in the text. In fact, it would take a little convincing that this isn't simply a transcript of one of his consulting workshops.  Mr. Misino is relatively entertaining, but I'm not convinced that he is also an educator.<br />There are a few of his hostage negotiation stories sprinkled in as flavor, but often the point is not terribly clear. Chapter 10 attempts to tie his topic to the real world by illustrating how to negotiate for a car and a house but doesnt seem to show much negotiation after all ... just how to research a good price and then stick to your price demand. This could be a really great, powerful book if it were better organized and edited.  The casual style tends to ramble in circles around the two main points:<br />1) Know what you want ahead of time. What is and isnt negotiable, and what your plan B is.<br />2) Negotiation is establishing rapport, getting information, and getting the deal.<br />Quite a bit of text is spent on building rapport, including how to listen actively and get to the first &quot;yes&quot;.  Less focus is put on how to gather information relevant to business deals (or any deals that dont involve hostages), and very little focus is spent on getting the deal. The book description from the publisher is  a good outline of the book's meat ... if you've read the description, you wont really need to read the book.  So while I can see that this would be an interesting read for those in training to be hostage negotiators, the connection to business negotiation is extremely tenuous.	2004-06-28

Many (not all, but many) teen parents will want to participate in the religious ceremonies surrounding the birth of a child. Lindsay does not mention religion in any way. Thus she leaves out a major talking point and planning point that many teens do care about.  She also fails to remind teens that they might want to consult with their religious leader when talking about contraceptives in their sexual relationship. She also does teens a disservice by claiming that condoms will prevent AIDS...there are several studies showing that this is a dangerous assumption.y teens do care about.

The length is considerable, but most of it flows along nicely.  Any book of this length will have a few pages where the pace slows.  The political angle is the most prevalent ... this isn't really a techno-thriller or an action thriller.  For example, Crichton's &quot;Airframe&quot; is an airplane techno-thriller, and you'll learn a lot about airplanes.  Clancy likewise teaches you a lot about submarines (Hunt for Red October), or nuclear bombs (Sum of All Fears), even if sometimes you feel the story has paused so you can read a scientific journal article. However, I didn't really learn anything in this novel ... &quot;Rising Sun&quot; (Crichton) was more 'educational'.<br />I think I bought this book because I heard it contained P-3 Orion aircraft, of which I'm a fan.  Indeed, they are mentioned in mostly realistic ways, but they are not a main player. The only P-3 Orion technical 'problem' was on page 821 where Hagberg says that the Orion throttled back to deploy dipping sonobuoys. A &quot;dipping sonobuoy&quot; is the terminology typically used for the equipment on a anti-submarine helicopter, not an airplane. While you could stretch the term to apply to the sonobuoys planes drop, it's not what one would usually use.<br />Overall, it's nice entertainment.	2004-02-16

The reporting is very detailed, and the analysis seems to be objective.  The last 50 pages of the book are appendices, reference notes, and an index. Included are many excerpts of letters, reports, and interviews. These excerpts give the book a human touch and help liven up the at-times monotonous recitation of facts and timelines.<br />The first chapter of the book was written after most of the manuscript was complete, as a review and partial analysis of the EP-3E incident on Hainan Island, China, in April 2001.  The book went to press before the plane was returned to the U.S., but the authors comment on changing attitudes in the world of airborne surveillance as compared to the height of the Cold War.<br />If you're a SERIOUS student of surveillance activities in the the Cold War, you'll find this to be a worthy textbook.

It is very clear to me that this book was part of a longer story that was randomly broken into pieces in order to be printed as more than one volume...the ending leaves every single thread hanging.  That said, at least the premise of the situation is pausible enough to suspend your disbelief and help you get through the book.<br />I bought this series because I read that EP-3Es were given some serious exposure.  The sections where they appear contain a few technical inaccuracies (such as saying that the plane would make a pass at 50ft over the ocean to count survivors...in reality the plane would likely not drop below 300 feet). Overall, the series is off to an okay start, but I wouldn't put the talent or the accuracy anywhere near Tom Clancy.	2002-01-23

But that's what he's paid to do..to be in harms way and to put the needs of America above his own.  Shane says he wanted to be a Top Gun, a fighter pilot, and P-3s were his very last choice when he was unable to get into the jet-pilot training lineup.  So he took that arrogant, stick-jockey jet-pilot attitude to a slow reconnaisance plane.<br />The book is marginally entertaining for those who don't know or understand the P-3 or EP-3E community.  For those who do know that world, this book will make you really mad and confirm your suspicions about Shane's character.	2002-01-23

This gives him  a fantastic grounding from which to write about software patents.<br />Why  should YOU read this book?<br />  Just as a literate programmer reads  journal articles, design documents, and source code, so should he or she be  able  to evaluate software patents. This ability is fast becoming a  competitive necessity, for economic as well as legal  reasons. (page  55)<br />What's in this book?<br />Nichols first explains what the problem is.  Why are software patents a problem? How can one enforce a software patent?  In what ways does software not fit into the regular patent process? What  exactly is a patent anyway?<br />Software patents are currently defined in  terms of algorithms. But what exactly does the court system understand to  be an algorithm, and how is that different from the viewpoint of a computer  scientist? Answering this question is the subject of chapter two. Along the  way, Nichols shows the problems with trying to patent (under the current  system) several different programming paradigms such as self-modifying  programs and distributed computing, imperative mode versus object-oriented  mode versus functional and declarative paradigms. He also shows how  software engineering techniques can help document the pieces needed in  writing a software patent specification.<br />Chapter three defines some  major terminology of the patent process and shows how it relates to  software. For example, there is a distinction between 'novel' and  'nonobvious'. Also, a software patent must carefully delineate the 'scope'  and 'claims' of the patent. To help make this book as practical as  possible, this chapter examines (in depth), four actual software patents: a  text-searching system; an object-oriented database; a 'C' source code  blocker; and a special-purpose sorting method.<br />The next chapter takes on  the debate of whether or not software patents are a good idea, and examines  each side in detail including the practical concerns of enforcement and  detection of infringement. After looking at this debate, Nichols presents  the SDKR (named after the lastname initials of its authors: samuelson,  Davis, Kapor, and Reichman). The SDKR is a proposal which ``advocates a  special form of intellectual property for computer software'' to replace  software patents by doing several things:<br />  merge software copyright  and software patent;  focus on mass market software only;<br />  preserve the software market and still foster software innovation;<br />  create a clear set of legal rules specifically for software;<br />  provide legal protection on a shorter length than current patents,  acknowledging that the software lifecycle is very different  from other  patentable inventions;<br />  provide protection to a program's behavior  instead of just the exact implementation that produces a behavior; and<br />  protect ``innovation'' of software instead of the stricter  ``inventiveness'' required by current patent law.<br />Chapter six is chock  full of practical advice for software developers who want to protect their  software. The next two chapters are a summary and a look at the future of  software programming. I highly recommend this book to anyone who plans to  develop software as a livelihood... software patents can not only protect  your investment of time, energy, and creativity in the programming process,  but they can even earn you some extra money if others are forced to license  your software from you in order not to violate your patent.examines  each side in detail including the practical concerns of enforcement and  detection of infringement. After looking at this debate, Nichols presents  the SDKR (named after the lastname initials of its authors: samuelson,  Davis, Kapor, and Reichman).
