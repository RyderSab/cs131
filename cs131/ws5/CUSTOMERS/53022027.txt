However, traumatised from his experience, he found it difficult to adjust.  He loved his wife Ellen and son Joe deeply, but having returned almost as a stranger to them, he had hurdles to cross to forge bonds with them.  While he desperately wanted to get out of the familiar and routine surroundings, Ellen and Joe wanted to stay put almost as desperately.<br />Unsentimental and almost glommy, this book is not for readers looking for dramatic plots or romance.

Too much focussed was given to the story of the journalist and his pursuit of the Savior.  I would have preferred if more emphasis is given on Jack's 'fix-it' jobs.

This results in the flaw in this book, your emotions are never affected by the book to a large extent because it also leads you back to a feel-good environment.

You know that a few years down the road, lies will be exposed and there will be heartbreaks, but you also know where things are leading towards in the end.<br />Predictable and boring -that's how I feel about the book, no doubt the emotions are pretty powerful, but this doesn't stop me from flipping through most of the pages and knowing what ending to expect.

Joseph Antonelli had never once doubted his own ability  to win once he took  up a case,  but that did not mean that truth and justice would always prevail.<br />The book had proven to be disappointing.  I struggled through the first half of the book.  While there were brilliant sparks during the courtroom argument, those failed to lift the story which was otherwise shallow and unexciting.

Each of the visitors had his own agenda and when murder was committed barely fifty yards away from where Dalgliesh was staying, he was determined that the murderer should not get away.  It would however, require all Dalgliesh¡¦s intelligence to not only uncover the murderer, but also to obtain sufficient evidence to convict him.<br />As usual, P D James¡¦ novel is a pleasure to read.  Very rarely do detective stories provide the thrill to keep the reader¡¦s heart pumping, the mystery to keep his curiosity alive till the last page, but also wonderful insights into each characters.  In simple words, her novels are never shallow.  Enjoyment from her novel is never derived from skimping through the pages, but from drinking in each sentence slowly.  And it never hurts that Adam Dalgliesh has remained such a charismatic character all along.	2002-05-12

However, she surprised herself (and the reader too) by taking on the task cheerfully (after her initial whining was defeated by her conscience) and successfully, and in the process, discovered that being ordinary did not mean a less colourful life.<br />I like the story for its optimism and the cheerful characters who seemed to have answers to everything, even to what seemed to be hopeless situations.  Of course, in reality, things would not be as simple and straightforward, but once in a while, it is good to come across a story which earn the reader¡¦s tears of happiness, rather than sadness.	2002-04-21

While Iris struggled in a loveless marriage, Laura also appeared to be going through a difficult life, which probably resulted in her death when she was just a young adult.  <br />This is an intelligent book.

They are complemented by a colourful and lively cast of characters, who add much dimension to the story.  The story is sometimes heartbreaking and someimes innocent.  This is one of her best books.<br />However, the story made me strangely sad because it seems to say ¡V you win some, you lose some.  In the pursuit of their dreams, Tom and Cathy seem to have also lost something, or rather, someone precious.  They have both lost someone who share their passion to pursue their dreams, just because the dreams they are chasing are different.<br />The other fault is that the ending is too fairy-tale for my liking and interesting characters such as June and Shona are not fully developed.	2001-08-22

The storyline is predictable, and the characters, ordinary.  However, the charm of the book is strong.  Reading the book is as soothing as curling up on a comfortable couch, drinking a cup of tea.

He started taking weekly lessons from his professor again.  Only this time, the lessons were about life, taught from Morrie¡¦s life experiences.  Beyond the wisdom and insight imparted explicitly by Morrie (such as intangible love and relationships over tangible materialism, do not be afraid to feel), also touching the hearts were the implicit values taught.  It showed us that a teacher¡¦s teaching could go a long way and could have a powerful influence on his students.  I find this particularly inspiring, as complaints that being a teacher does not have its rewards are not new.  It also showed us that wisdom grow proportionately with age, so do not be afraid to grow old!  However, how many of us could age so graciously as Morrie? This book serves a timely reminder to all of us, who are becoming older everyday.<br />I remember thinking to myself: Mr Albom, you are so lucky, so many of us do not have great teachers to begin with.  However, at the end of the book, you have earned my respect.  I have to admit that there are indeed great teachers all around us, but it takes a special person willing to spend the time, commitment and effort to find one and unleash the greatness.<br />I have to admit that I did not take to the book when I first started.

The thrill of working for the high profile and popular Jonathan soon turned nightmarish as Cole uncovered things that indicated that Jonathan may not be as upright and honest as he claimed to be.  It would be an uphill task for Cole to turn against the public¡¦s darling and bring him to justice.<br />The story was promising, filled with sufficient question marks to keep the reader interested and yet not too complex for the reader to follow.  I just felt that too much time may have been devoted to the Cole-Lucy romance and the ending a little bit too abrupt.  I would love to see what really happened to Cole-Jonathan saga in the end.

Her mother, we were told, had left when she was too young to remember.  As Kate saw it, she was a lucky girl, with her father giving her every attention she needed, and classmates fighting to be her friends.  Yet, we the readers have a nagging suspicion that Kate¡¦s world was far from perfect.  It was a gripping ride for the readers as we follow Kate¡¦s complex thoughts all the way till the truth was revealed.<br />This is one of the most satisfying read of the year 2000.  As in her previous two books (The Last Girl and Freezing), the author lets the readers see the story through her character¡¦s eyes.  The unique thing about this is that the characters are always far from perfect and are prone to complex thoughts.  The readers are often left in the dark as to what is the truth behind these thoughts which make her books thrilling to read.	2000-12-31

A straightforward task for the experienced private investigator and it could have been wrapped up easily except that issues deeper and more complex surfaced;  and it would be against Elvis¡¦ conscience not to resolve these, even if getting involved meant risking his and Pike¡¦s lives.<br />This is definitely not one of my favourite Robert Crais¡¦ books.  After having enjoyed 5 of his other books, I naturally had very high expectations of this one.  To be fair, the author explored new grounds in this book.  He touched on racism and issues on adoption.  The setting was also shifted from L A to Louisiana.<br />My complaint is that the story is too shallow and deeper grounds should have been explored.  The ending climaxed but the conclusion was too abrupt.  An enjoyable read, nevertheless, although it did leave me feeling slightly disappointed.	2000-12-23

Pressured by Gerald, but unable to divulge the secret behind his blackmail to anyone, only when the mystery surrounding the fateful night was solved would Hyacinth be able to get on with her life.<br />The plot was gripping.  However, the impressive part was the way the emotional aspects in the book was handled.  The sweetness of being in love, the tension between mother and daughter, the bitterness of a marriage breakdown, the pressure and burden of keeping a terrible secret, and the pain of losing loved ones were well-explored.  Subtle, but intense at the same time.	2000-12-07

Impressive.  I remained blissfully unaware of where the story would lead to until the ending part.<br />Readers of this book should be familiar with who Repairman Jack was, how his character was shaped and what made him the man he was today, or it would be terribly difficult to understand why he undertook the ¡¥fix-it¡¦ tasks in Conspiracies.<br />Readers who have not read previous Repairman Jack novels would have difficulty understanding, or even liking him.  His heroism did not really shine through, as he remained passive most of the time, reacting to situations rather than taking initiatives and being spontaneous.  His devotion to Gia and Vicky was also not well-illustrated, as the 2 ladies in his life had very limited roles in the book.  My advice to readers new to Jack:  Read The Tomb to know him first.<br />Also, too many questions remained unanswered.  Olivia¡¦s death was not really explained? what did the ¡¥wet¡¦ painting done by Melaine have to do with the story?  Why did Jack¡¦s scars itch?  I look forward to the sequel which could answer my questions.	2000-11-27

Anna, the eldest daughter, blindly in love with an out-of-work author; Helen, the youngest, struggling to become a nun; Brendan, the only son who went against the norms and his parents¡¦ wishes to work in a farm in Ireland.  Also weaved into the story was Frank, the best man, a successful business man, though slightly less successful in the affairs of the heart, Father Hurley, the priest who married the couple twenty-five years ago, and feisty Maureen, Deirdre¡¦s best friend.<br />These were ordinary characters, but what would make the reader go on is that each of the character had its own unique tale to tell, from managing family relationships, to hidden and secret affairs of the heart. <br />I felt a slight disappointment, however, at the end of the book as it left me with a sense of non-fulfillment.  We were given insights to the problems but were not shown solutions.  For instance, Deirdre¡¦s uneasy relationship with her children did not appear to be improved and Maureen¡¦s relationship with Walter did not develop further.  Maybe this is the author¡¦s reflection of the real world, that not every question has an answer to it.	2000-09-26
US	53022027	R6MXFL4YTGUOE	0553565095	399507971	Free Fall (Elvis Cole)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	I Like It	Elvis Cole, the lovable private investigator with a sense of humour and a  heart returned with his partner, Joe Pike to help his client, Jennifer,  find out what was the problem that seemed to big for her fianc?to solve.   Like all Elvis Cole novels, we could expect that the case would not be too  simple or straightforward for Elvis and Joe.  The thrill lies in joining  Elvis and Joe in a roller-coaster ride as they set out to unravel the  mystery and to get out of the mess they soon find themselves in.<br />This is  the fifth Elvis Cole novel which I have read and I am determined to read  all of them.  Occasionally I find books in which the plot and characters  are equally attractive.  This is one of them.	2000-09-12

Central to the story is the lovable Fenny Ness and her  friend Lee.  A summary of the story will not do justice to the book as all  the characters in the book, no matter how small their roles were, made the  whole book came alive.  The story brought in Hollywood, romance and  rivalry, and traces of tragedies, but through them all, the characters  remained true to themselves and their beliefs.  The whole book is so  lively, so lovable that I found it hard to put down.<br />Reading the book, I  felt as if I know Fenny, Bill, Lee and gang all my life, sharing their  laughter and tears.  It was as if I am part of Cup O¡¦Delight.  It made me  feel inspired and encouraged at the thought that there is some place in the  world where faults are accepted, where rules can be broken gracefully and  where love conquers all.	2000-09-10

Elvis Cole, private investigator, was tasked by a famous director, Peter,  to find his ex-wife and son.   A seemingly simple assignment soon turned  out to be mission impossible.  After locating Karen and Toby, Elvis soon  uncovered that the former was owned by the mafia, who would not be at all  happy with the interference of Elvis and his partner, Joe Pike.  Being his  usual righteous self, Elvis could not sit back and see Karen's life  destroyed by the mob.  However, could he and Joe take on the mafia, save  Karen from its clutches, and escape unscathed?<br />Like all other Robert  Crais' books, it had the compelling power which made it impossible for me  to put the book down.  I have always believed that for a book to be  likeable, we must like the characters in the book and really feel for them.   This is precisely the reason which I enjoy this book so much.  I was  rooting for Elvis and Joe all the way as I followed the story which simply  took my breath away.	2000-08-20

I read this book simply because I like the Elvis Cole character very much.  In this story, he was righteous as usual,  but what made him humane and loveable was that, like every human being, he  was not perfect.  He could get emotionally carried away, he was also prone  to making wrong deductions and judgment.  Beneath his tough ways, he had a  vulnerable side too.  We were shown these side of his character amidst a  plot that appeared complex enough to make me stay interested in the book  from beginning till the end. In this story, Cole was tasked to find a  valuable Japanese manuscript.  Soon after, the threats made to his client  and his family, the disappearance of his client's daughter, the involvement  of a Japanese cult and the Japanese mafia made the assignment appeared more  dangerous and complex than it really was. I found myself on an exciting  ride as Cole and his partner, Pike, took it upon themselves to rescue the  missing daughter, and at the same time, unravel the riddles that were  puzzling them (as well as me). A thoroughly enjoyable, hard to put down  book.	2000-08-13

He was tasked to find his client's husband and son.  Originally dismissed by  Cole as a simple case of husband taking off with his mistress, bringing the  son along, he soon found that he was eating his words as murders, drugs and  the mafia became entangled into the case.  <br />In addition to the explosive  plot, what made the book enjoyable was the Elvis Cole character himself.   He faced life, including dangerous situations with bravado and humour.   Beneath the bravado and tough exterior, his sense of justice and loyalty to  his clients made him extremely humane and appealing.<br />I found the book to  be thoroughly enjoyable and hard to put down.  The fast-paced and tight  plot kept me flipping the pages, eager to find out the ending.	2000-08-09

The schoolteacher, David, disgraced after  a soured affair with his student, took refuge in his daughter, Lucy's farm.   He became more involved in his daughter's life than he expected to be and  came to see the ugly and down side of a life he had never experienced  before.<br />The book, though easy to read, was disturbing as we could feel  the helplessness of both David and Lucy in a situation which they both have  no control over.  Through David and Lucy, the book has offered us a glimpse  into a part of the lives of whites in South Africa.  I enjoyed the book,  save for a nagging thought in my mind.  As I have limited knowledge of the  history of South Africa, I could not help but wonder how balance is the  view in this book.  Of course, this book being a fiction, need not provide  two sides of issues raised in the book, so my advice is, read and enjoy.   There is no doubt that this is an enjoyable, though disturbing read.	2000-08-05

This is the first book by Mr  Robert Crais which I've read and I will definitely read the others!	2000-06-15

It started off prominsingly enough, we were introduced to intersting characters, each pursuing their own dreams.  However, about three quater through the book,  it seemed that the story itself was unsure what it wanted itself to be.   Was it going to be about dreams, pursing or giving up because of other  priorities in life?  Was it going to be a romance?  Or was it going to  become a thriller, with a slightly crazy man pursuing his love?  The book  tried to bring in a bit of everything and ultimately left all the areas  underdeveloped.	2000-05-26

For once, Adam Dalgliesh does not play the role of the investigating officer, but this definitely does not make the plot  less intriguing. A must try for readers who do not think that beautiful  writing can exist along with a thrilling whodunit story.	2000-03-10

It did not manage to make me laugh either.  I felt really sad when Dorothy strayed into the wrong path, none  of her family really assisted to set her right.  I could not really connect  to the characters and did not really like them enough to care what happen  to them in the end.	2000-01-29
US	53022027	R2NVS9UDK5EP8G	0385316925	491170361	Fortune's Hand	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Predictable and tired plot but with non-typecast characters	On reading the synopsis of the book, I formed my own expectations and predictions of the book and rather to my disappointment, they were more or less accurate.  The story is predictable and the plot, tried-and-tested  before: a man, who in his   greed for more, makes reckless decisions and  risks, his downfall is predictable.  The only thing I find interesting is  that the characters in the books are not typecast.  Robb, for instance, is  not ruthless in his quest for wealth, as we would have presumed most people  of such nature would be.  Instead, he is portrayed as a gentlemen, with a  heart for the underdogs.  Here, it does not make me close the book with a  'serve you right' at the end, but instead, I finished the book with a sigh,  sympathising with him, even though  I knew, almost right from the start,  how he would end up to be.	1999-12-30

You just need plenty of stamina and  technical mountaineering skills and these could be trained.  The book convinced me otherwise.  Luck, endurance,  play great parts too.  The events were so realistically recounted that I  often felt breathless.	1999-12-26

Books	3	3	3	N	N	Wonderful, but limited	The story revolves around Dena, an outwardly tough and ambitious girl - your typical modern day carrer woman by appearance, but inwardly vulnerable and lonely.  She longed for something but the problem was, she did not know  what she lacked and refused to let others get close to her to help her find  out what it was. Written in a lively style, the book has full of adorable  characters. The story was able to make me engrossed to follow Dena's ups  and downs, rooting for her and symapathise with her.  The only problem was,  it failed to touch me and  sadden me in areas which I felt is should - the  part on Dena's mother and her brother.  I failed to empathize with these 2  characters as I feel that I do not know them in-depth, the way I knew Dena.   In fact, the only character that I knwe in-depth is Dena.  I felt that the  other characters were not given enough development for me to know and feel  them.	1999-12-02

What he did not know (but what we  readers know), is that his attention was unwanted and that he is clearly a  psychopath.   The story, told by Larry himself, is all the more creepy as  we read Larry's abnormal thoughts, but yet he was able to rationalise to  himself that all he was doing was normal.   A good book to recommend to  people who like suspense which builds up from the first page and does not  last end the last page.	1998-12-13

I first chanced upon the author's Legacies when I was browsing through CNN's website and thought that it sounded like an interesting book.  Knowing that Legacies is the second book about Repairman Jack, I decided to  give The Tomb a try first. Upon reading the book, I thank my lucky stars  that I have come across the book.  I was intruiged from the first page and  was not able to put down the book. A thriller-mystery-horror with subtle  hints of romance, the book tells of how Repairman Jack goes about, in his  own way, solves the mystery of the missing necklace and embarks on a  dangerous rescue misson.  He brushes aside obstacles and faces dangers that  come his way.  Despite his cool exterior, his good intentions and  commitment to girlfriend Gia and her daughter makes him a thouroughly  believable character.  Jack, you have become my hero!	1998-12-04
