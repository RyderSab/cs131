They are cast together in a quest to overthrow the Darke ExtraOrdinary Wizard, DomDaniel, who has taken over the Wizard's Tower and threatens to ruin the lives of the townspeople.  <br /> <br />Jenna was found in the snow by Silas Heap on the same night that his newly-born Seventh Son was pronounced dead and whisked away. He and his wife, Sarah, accepted Jenna as one of their own and raised her for ten years.  <br /> <br />It is discovered on her tenth birthday that Jenna is someone special, who must be protected at all costs. Marcia takes a special interest in the Heap family and ushers them to safety with the White Witch, Zelda. Mysterious charms and potions may protect them for a while. They may also learn the answers to many secrets and legends.  <br /> <br />But was the infant Septimus Heap really dead at birth? And if alive, who is this most Magykal wizard - the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son? And who will stop DomDaniel from destroying all of their lives with his encroaching Darkness?  <br /> <br />This book is great for those young and old. The spells and charms are quaint, such as Fly Free With Me and Fade into the Aire, with some suspense, but no outright scary or horrific elements to frighten young readers.  <br /> <br />The story is engrossing with a great sense of resolution at the end for each character, rather than a promised continuation, which is a nice feeling for young readers who don't want to be frustrated with wondering what happened to everyone involved. The book is great for adults as well.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

When we're younger and more ambitious, we hold on to things that give us security to make it through the days, thinking that these very things will be the ones that will enable us to achieve the most and become our best.  <br /> <br />Ginnie, the main character in the novel, is one of those women. She has devoted her life to her two children, Amber and Molly, and her career as a psychologist helping troubled children.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, her marriage is more of a close friendship. Her husband and her haven't made love in years and marriage counseling has failed.  <br /> <br />When her older daughter, Molly, moves out for school, she thinks that time alone is what they need to reclaim magic they never really had. But she finds out the magic isn't there because it's not possible. Sinking into a depression that is flavored by a personal friend's unhappiness with her own life, she eventually allows herself to be pulled into passion for the first time.  <br /> <br />These internal struggles are the real heart of The River House. Ginnie is a sympathetic, believable character who doesn't necessarily make the most socially accepted choices, but she does this with a heavy conscience and something that we can all relate to.  <br /> <br />Her grief, exhaustion, and hunger for youth and real attention will get to you. It reminds the reader that life truly is short and that you need to make the right choices when you can.  <br /> <br />It's never easy to tell what's really important and valuable, no matter how old you are or what position of life you're in. You have to sacrifice greatly at times and it's not always fair.  <br /> <br />The pacing of the book is rather slow, but it fits this type of genre. It is all told through the first person point of view, which strongly enables the reader to sit tightly in the leads head. Her emotions come through easily, and the pages are filled with genuine emotion and life. Author Leroy writes beautiful words, showing off an admirable classy talent, having each scene a joy to read simply because it's so expertly put.  <br /> <br />On the down side of things, more energy into various scenes would have spruced this book up. If more tension had been placed, or more action somewhere, it would have rated even higher.  <br /> <br />As it stands, reading this novel will make your head feel dreamy and almost unreal; not an easy feat for any author to pull off. A touching story that is both tragic and beautiful in it's own way - much like real life.  <br />	2005-09-08

It's blank but for one illustration in the middle - a woodcut of a dragon with spread wings, a long looped tail and outstretched claws. In its claws hangs a banner on which runs a single word in gothic lettering: DRAKULYA.  <br /> <br />The book launches her on a journey of discovery that not only takes her into her family's near past, but takes her back through the centuries into a forgotten age of evil. There, she finds an unusual curse that holds terrible ramifications for the future. <br /> <br />The name Dracula pertains to the fifteenth century prince of Wallachia Vlad Tepes - better known as Vlad the Impaler. But what does the Impaler have to do with Paul and Helen, the young woman's parents? Why is her father so reluctant to talk about his life? Why is her mother's death shrouded in mystery?  <br /> <br />The young woman eventually comes face to face with the embodiment of evil. Will she be able to resist when it calls to the history in her blood?  <br /> <br />The Historian tells the story of an unnamed protagonist and her family invovled in a desperate quest to destroy an ancient and malicious power. It makes us realize that Vlad Tepes still lives.  <br /> <br />Readers looking for historical intrigue surrounding the life and death of Vlad the Impaler will be somewhat disappointed. Instead, Elizabeth Kostova spins an enjoyable fantasy about vampires in the style of Stoker's Dracula.  <br /> <br />The book is plagued by a general silliness. Not only are the vampires real, they are scared of such things as holy water and crucifixes. It runs long (600 plus pages) and occasionally drags a little, but never completely loses our interest.  <br /> <br />The flow of the story gently takes us toward the allogorical message at the end. Evil thrives, just as it has through the ages. What will we do about it?  <br />	2005-09-08

One victim's wife is suing Huron Security, the federally funded company in charge of preventing such attacks since 9-11.  <br /> <br />Extenuating circumstances may make things more difficult than they already are. Scott has been given the high-profile case because his best friend and former lover, Natalie Caldwell, who had been in charge of it, is now dead.  <br /> <br />The red ribbon with gold cross left on her body found lying in the harbor ties her in to the serial killer known as \\"Little Jack.\\" Although the powers-that-be don't want to hear or deal with it, there are discrepancies in the evidence that say otherwise.  <br /> <br />They would prefer to have this murder tied neatly in with the others so as to have it all solved at once rather than cause a residential uproar. However, Detectives Flaherty and Kozlowski don't intend to be bullied into letting a separate murderer go free.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately for Scott, he's their number one suspect. Now he's faced with trying to solve the murder of his friend while still attempting to run a successful case.  <br /> <br />That's a combination that's proving to be more than he can handle when he uncovers some incriminating information against the very company he's supposed to be representing. This information puts Scott in a fatal position since Huron Security has direct ties to the mob.  <br /> <br />A growing attraction between Scott and Flaherty means she feels the need to be overly objective when Scott requires her help the most. He has to convince her to check out his findings before he ends up injail or in the morgue next to Natalie.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />David Hosp's debut novel is an impressive piece of work. It pulses with excitement from page one with little to no down time from the front cover to the back.  <br /> <br />He's concocted the perfect mix of political intrigue, courtroom drama and suspense with a dab of romance thrown in for good measure.

Jonas Mast had gone to Ohio following a hurtful misunderstanding caused by feuding parents.  <br /> <br />Having discovered that Leah had remained faithful to their love even after so long, he could do nothing less than go back to her and do whatever the bishop deemed necessary to prove himself worthy of the People. Even if it meant giving up his love of woodworking and spending his life toiling in the fields or the blacksmith shop instead.  <br /> <br />Jonas's return would ultimately spark another, one that would bring with it the inevitability of opening long-buried secrets. Jonas's younger brother, Jake, comes back to Gobbler's Knob under the pretense of speaking to the bishop on Jonas's behalf. In actuality, he wishes to court and eventually marry Leah's sister Lydiann.  <br /> <br />Unbeknownst to the main players, this is a relationship that cannot happen and bringing the reason to light could cause permanent damage to the already tenuous association between the Ebersol and Mast families. This Pandora's Box will have long-reaching and potentially long-lasting effects.  <br /> <br />In Beverly Lewis's fifth and final installment to the Abram's Daughters series, the sins of the past and the hopes of the future are all wrapped up into one tidy package.

He said he was going to visit an Aunt in Ostia, but he never returned and the only thing he leaves behind him are some personal effects and a trail of several odd clues.  <br /> <br />For instance, shortly before his disappearance, he attempted to take on various different jobs, even applied to the Vigiles. One of the last people to see him is a reclusive old sea merchant who claims, despite rumors otherwise, to have never been a pirate...piracy being one of the things that, officially, no longer exists.  <br /> <br />This sixteenth book following the adventures of Falco has several interesting twists. An informer (private eye) of some renown, he, along with his best friend Petronis and his love Helena find themselves in an increasingly dangerous situation, filled with Cicilain pirates, kidnapping and murder.  <br /> <br />The series is famous for its rich depiction of Ancient Rome and each one seems to focus on a slightly different area of the culture and history, teaching us a great deal. This time, as you may have gathered, it's piracy.  <br /> <br />It was interesting to see how the pirates were used by the Roman government, then declared completely stamped out, though, unofficially, everyone knew it was still going on. Also, the rules that these pirates abided by to make sure that their victim's families paid up showed them to be shrewd businessmen as well as criminals.  <br /> <br />	2005-08-18

Cadillac might be the key to fulfilling an old prophecy of Soul City's downfall.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Soul City takes the reader on a fantastic journey through American soul culture. Sadly, the book doesn't do justice to the topic.  <br /> <br />Tour's creative style is overshadowed by his poorly conceived allegory.

The reader once again learns more about Sidda, Lulu, Baylor and Little Shep and their parents. After the reminisces, different characters tell the story of the kidnapping of Rosalyn, the granddaughter of Necie. This painful event is summarized with reactions from all of the Ya-ya clan, as well as the painful and dramatic actions they all take to deal with the kidnapping and its aftermath. <br /> <br />Another winner from Wells, this novel is even more hard-hitting on the tear ducts than the last two Ya-ya novels and uses more drama and suspense to hit home its points. It explores more raw emotions, relying less on comedy than on the believable interactions and reactions of the Ya-ya clan. It's worth a read after the first two in the series, Little Altars Everywhere and Divine Secrets of the Ya-ya Sisterhood.	2005-07-28

Pleasant church.  <br /> <br />She hadn't had an entirely easy childhood. Her mother left, taking along Jocie's older sister, seven years earlier.  <br /> <br />Outside of a general curiosity about the woman who gave birth to her and periodically missing the sister she fondly remembers, Jocie had come to terms with having an unconventional family. She had her father, of course, and her grandmother and great-aunt.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the most important person in her life, after her own dad, was \\"Jupiterian\\" and newspaperman extraordinaire, Wes. He had shown up out of nowhere not intending to stay, but an instant attachment to young Jocie meant he was still there a decade later.  <br /> <br />Now, God had answered two of Jocie's prayers--for a dog and the return of her sister Tabitha. Both were blessings in their own way, yet both also proved to be portholes to long-buried family secrets.  <br /> <br />Jocie, having been weaned on the Bible and newspaper publishing, was a truth seeker and therefore determined to discover everything she could. However, when one hidden detail hit too close to home for her, she decided she wasn't ready to face it. Soon the greater threat of having to confront tragedy just might be what's necessary to put things into proper perspective for her. <br /> <br />The majority of Ann Gabhart's novel has the feel of the relaxed summer it's set in. Life, and the plot progression, is initially simple and easy-going.  <br /> <br />One never knows what surprises God and nature has in store, though. Turbulent skies and unsteady pasts can change a person's life in an instant.  <br /> <br />Readers should not be fooled or prematurely disappointed by what appears to be a sluggish beginning. In The Scent of Lilacs, surprises wait around every corner.  <br />	2005-07-08

When Tully Mars tosses a massage table through ranch boss Thelma Barston's giant plate-glass window, he is forced to embark on the adventure of a lifetime.  <br /> <br />He loads his two piece art collection, horse named Mr. Twain and lucky conch shell in his pick-up truck and heads south. Trouble with bounty hunters on the Gulf Coast sends him on a shrimp boat of mercy to Punta Margarita where he stumbles into a job as a guide for the Lost Boys fishing resort.  <br /> <br />A Salty Piece of Land tells Tully's story with humor and reflection. As we travel with him we meet medicine men, Joni Mitchell, Clark Gable, Captain Kirk, the Patron St. of Lightning, treasure hunters, pirates, Solomon, St. Peter and an indefatigable band of misfits who will do anything for a friend.  <br /> <br />When Tully lands himself in Spring Break trouble in San Pedro involving a couple of young blondes from his past, he is rescued by a unique and immensely lovable 101-year-old heroin. Cleopatra Highbourne assignes him a navigation position on her sailing vessel, the Lucretia, and, eventually, a restoration job in her lighthouse on Cayo Loco.  <br /> <br />As the keeper of the light he searches the globe for the soul of the light - a Fresnel bulls-eye lense. Along the way he learns that it's the darkness that brings out what is sacred.  <br /> <br />Jimmy Buffet's book begins as a series of interrelated, but out of sequence, stories from Tully's life and develops into a moving narrative. His description of people and places in the Caribbean shows a competency not found in most books.  <br /> <br />However, it disappoints with stereotypical characters, stilted dialogue and occasionally excessive profanity. There are several scenes that do not further the plot and a couple of instances of vulgarity. There are some jarring inconsistencies in the narrative when characters switch from one activity to another without any transition. The vast majority of these problems appear about three fourths of the way through the book.  <br /> <br />In spite of this lackluster midsection, the book manages a strong and emotionally fullfilling ending. It's worth reading if only to remind us that adventures don't come calling like unexpected cousins from out of town. You have to go looking for them.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-29

Cintra Wilson, in her stunning debut novel, Colors Insulting to Nature, takes the reader on a tour through the underground reality of striving to \\"become a celebrity\\" in America. In the style of a burlesque Janet Fitch or Wally Lamb, Wilson introduces the protagonist, Liza Normal, as a scantily clad thirteen year-old auditioning her heart out for a T.V. commercial. Liza doesn't get the spot, but captures the reader's heart with her spunky determination. Liza's mother, Peppy Normal, stage-mother extraordinaire, decides to open a theater in a dilapidated firehouse to finance her daughter's and son's (Ned) education at the New York High School for Performing Arts, after being moved by a viewing of \\"Fame.\\" Liza's dreams are not realized, and the roof falls in, literally and figuratively, on her dreams of pre-pubescent romance and stardom.  <br /> <br />She is forced to attend the local public high school and things only go downhill from there. Liza, after a traumatic loss of her virginity and her hair, eventually moves in with her best friend, Lorna, whose mother is a midwife/drug dealer.  <br /> <br />She sports a mohawk, a safety pin through her nose and an untouchable attitude. Inside though, the reader can still see little Liza Normal, underdressed wannabe child star, struggling to surface.  <br /> <br />Liza travels through each level of the Hollywood underground, coming back occasionally to speak with agoraphobic Ned and perpetually antagonistic Peppy. She develops romances and a drug addiction, and like any Hollywood wannabe or superstar, does her time in rehab. She comes out renewed in her search for stardom and eventually finds that a side venture that she loathes will be her way \\"in.\\"  <br /> <br />Cintra Wilson peppers the novel with editorials, making an entertaining novel into an adventure in Hollywood and a hilarious tongue-in-cheek take on the endless quest to be \\"discovered.\\" She points out in subtle and not-so-subtle ways the tendency of Americans to look for instant gratification and how we love and leave our shooting stars.  <br /> <br />Liza's recollections and reflections are all based in movies, whether real movies or the \\"movie of her life,\\" clearly showing Wilson's intent of portraying America's great obsession. <br />	2005-06-29

Not once has he been thrilled with these changes but this time he wishes he could just turn tail and run.  <br /> <br />When he's brought in to help the CIA and FBI with a murder investigation involving six victims, it's the start of a bad day that only goes downhill. What he's not initially aware of is that the execution of these people amounts to a political assassination. One of them just happens to be the White House Chief of Staff.  <br /> <br />For the next 48 hours, Drummond teams up with FBI agent Jennie Margold to figure out the who, what and why of the murders. The twist is that it seems to have something to do with a reward put out for the death of the President and there are guaranteed to be more murders in between...one of which may be Drummond's own. The mastermind behind this killing spree is always one step ahead of them, leaving no doubt as to whom is in control.  <br /> <br />The suspense begins within the first few pages and remains steady right through to the one-two punch of an ending. The reader is not only kept apprised of Drummond's progress from previous books but also continues to get to know him through the current story. He becomes more fleshed out as the series advances and the reader can't help but appreciate and come to love his ever-present acerbic wit.

All he had to do was serve a, hopefully uneventful, year in Vietnam then return home to continue on with his bright future.  <br /> <br />However, fate had other plans for Howard and he wouldn't make it longer than two weeks in Vietnam. A land mine combined with a few minutes of inattention would change his life forever.  <br /> <br />Howard suffered permanent brain damage. While his intelligence level did not diminish, his ability to speak, read and write was traded for an ugly facial scar. At first, everyone rallied around him, but as his capacity to cope became nonexistent, so did theirs.  <br /> <br />His father turned to alcohol, his girlfriend to drugs and other men and Howard shrank into himself severing human connection outside of what became a one-sided relationship with his now ex, Sylvia. He gave and she took.  <br /> <br />Whenever she needed something fixed, Howard was just a phone call away. But this time what she needed was a guardian for her 9-year-old son, Ryan. Someone to take care of him while she did her time in forced rehab.  <br /> <br />Ryan had as much desire for affection as Howard, but as the days turned to weeks and the weeks to months, the two of them formed a valuable friendship. Howard's comfortable and almost hermit-like routine wasn't satisfying anymore. He enjoyed the \\"family\\" breakfasts attended by all of his housemates and the warmth that seemed to radiate more freely from one to the other.  <br /> <br />As Sylvia's release loomed closer, so did the inevitable loss of Ryan from Howard's home. Once again, his inability to cope would surface and the results could be just as disastrous as the first time.  <br /> <br />Dave King has created a unique story by combining a self-protecting, fatherless child with a wounded and introverted Vietnam vet. He has taken a subject matter already ripe with raw emotion and turned it more insightful by making it a first-person account.	2005-05-03

She takes her job very seriously, maintaining a professional's detachment and objectiveness.  <br /> <br />She allows herself to get close to one colleague, Marcus. Only physically close, however, as they differ at times on the directions the stories they are working on should take.  <br /> <br />Their schedule is grueling, the conditions insufferable and what they witness daily is more than the average person can stand. Almost all correspondents can only take six months on duty before needing to \\"recoup\\" on home soil. But Caddie feels an honest affinity for the lands and their people and finds the idea that she is merely the eyes and ears for the people back home a little disturbing.  <br /> <br />The dedication page says it all:  <br /> <br />\\"For Kevin Carter and journalists everywhere who put their bodies and their souls on the line to cover war.\\"  <br /> <br />This book is about the horrors that the people who live in war zones must endure at the hands of leaders consumed with hate and lustful for power. But it's also about one woman's journey of self-discovery, traversing her inner heart and mind which are as desolate as the lands she covers. Haunted by memories and aided by photographic diaries, she is able to put down her other colleagues's jeers about her \\"constant need for bloodletting\\" and make her stand.  <br /> <br />This type of subject is hard to write about and is usually tackled by men via spy or 'hard-hitting journalism' genres. So it is unusual to see women writers venturing into this territory.  <br /> <br />Written in a 'you-are-there' style, Hamilton presents this story in a surrealistic form - giving you the perspective that you are witnessing the events as they happen, but are seeing everything from a distance...the distance between you.  <br /> <br />	2005-05-03

From being a child of hippie parents to becoming an adult today, Susan Jane Gilman tells the `not so usual' coming of age story.<br /><br />Where most books portray coming of age in the teen years, Gilman takes it a step further - the true coming of age into adulthood. The story begins in 1969 as Gilman's family was living in subsidized housing in Upper Manhattan where crimes and gang activity were rampant. She tells us of their vacation in Silver Lake where this city girl can experience nature like she'd never seen.<br /><br />Gilman speaks about her own insecurities and the desire to be liked and accepted. These desires didn't just appear when she hit adolescence. She show us these desires throughout her life as she brags about being in a movie at age four, changes her name to Sapphire and creates tall tales for show and tell in kindergarten, practices endlessly for the starring role in the school play and even as she vies for attention from boys and eventually men.<br /><br />She carries us through her changing body as she grows from child to woman and the reality of graduating from college and discovering the hiring managers of the world weren't exactly holding their breath waiting for her to graduate.<br /><br />But the story and possibly Gilman's life to a certain extent, took on a different meaning when she was assigned to do a story about a group of teenagers visiting the concentration camps in Germany. Technically Jewish, but not devout or exclusive, she gets serious at this point in the book and seeing the remnants of the people that lost their lives at the camps through the eyes of Gilman as an adult and through the eyes of the teenagers who were there with her created a sort of generation gap and bridge at the same time.<br /><br />After Gilman left the Jewish paper, she took on freelance jobs and eventually landed in Washington, DC. Her take on the government is a must for all to read. Her parents divorce after she becomes an adult and her range of emotions are as strong as if she were still a child. She also tells us about her wedding and her desire for it to be as untraditional as possible.<br /><br />Since she's a self-described feminist of now-divorced parents, the untraditional part is way over the top especially when she finds that her mind may be nonconformist but her body is built for tradition. But her life doesn't end at marriage, that's when her European period begins...<br /><br />Anyone born in the sixties will relate to this story. Gilman proves we all face many of the same choices whether we grow up in the city or the country, feminist or not. We're all women and that's our common bond.	2005-03-30

She hangs at the hot spots with the cool crowds and scores the best drugs. She manages a Tribeca restaurant, then parties until dawn. She's got it all...even a sugar daddy.  <br /> <br />But things aren't always as good as they appear from the outside. In reality, Lee is not truly happy.  <br /> <br />She's self-destructive. She works hard but has nothing solid to show for it because she spends her money at thrift shops and on good times rather than on rent and bills.  <br /> <br />She loves Yves, the older man who takes care of her but she knows she can never be the class act he deserves. And even all of his money can't make her more than content. The love of her life is her painting . . . something she has severely neglected of late. And for Lee, until she puts that back into its proper place on her list of priorities, nothing else will fall into place either but she's just too scared of failure. Failure in her art and failure in herself.  <br /> <br />So, she works and she spends and she parties until maybe, just maybe, she'll find within herself the determination to one day take that step toward the real Lee.  <br /> <br />Jardine Libaire's style of mixing beautiful prose with short, blunt thoughts is as much a poetic contrast as is the inner workings of her protagonist's confused mind. Here Kitty Kitty reads almost like a scrapbook of memories - a party here, a lovemaking session there, failed attempts to live an almost-forgotten dream in between.  <br /> <br />Some descriptions come in bursts and some are more drawn out. But they all portray the pensive and even angst-ridden emotions that are at war with the free spirit persona Lee has donned.  <br /> <br />This novel can easily be related to by any reader that can see past the obvious to the turmoil below the surface of themselves...a turmoil that many people feel and most deny as Lee did. Here Kitty Kitty serves as a sort of talisman that one can always digback to the surface no matter how deep the hole.  <br />	2005-03-30

And when some packages bearing Rafael's name are delivered to the mailroom beneath the detective agency, McCone is forced to consider the possibility that they've all been conned.  <br /> <br />In one crashing moment, McCone's agency is in danger of being fined and ultimately closed down. Who better to investigate the case than McCone herself, who has the most at stake?  <br /> <br />She could use her long-time lover, Hy Ripinsky's help and support, but by calling him, she must answer his marriage proposal. But she doesn't know what her answer will be and prefers not to explore her resistance too deeply.  <br /> <br />A visit to Aguilar's neighbors reveals that the man has a very different faade than the one publicly seen. He's a rather angry, rude, obnoxious man and he recently had a known felon as a house guest.  <br /> <br />But all leads lead to nowhere and the stakes continue to rise as bodies start dropping and McCone's nephew is shot at; then Julia Rafael is critically wounded.  <br /> <br />Cryptic messages are targeted at McCone and they hold the key to the shooter. But will they clear Julia's name?  <br /> <br />Continuing a series runs the risk of repeated storylines, but Muller has not succumbed to this common pitfall. Kudos to Muller for escaping that trap.	2005-03-09

He's confident that his lovely wife is innocent, but his determination will only lead him to a reality he finds even more appalling than her conviction. The question is: what will he do about it now?  <br /> <br />Denise Mina has written Deception in journal form with the absence of specific dates for each entry. The protagonist simply purges himself of his thoughts, emotions and discoveries whenever the mood strikes him. Due to the first person viewpoint, readers are only directly privy to the inner workings of Lachlan's mind and his perception of the other characters' reactions.  <br /> <br />For the most part, one does not feel as though they are missing out. The character of Lachlan is a multi-faceted one. The knowledge he gains takes him on a journey through his own emotional ability to grasp the difference between his misty view of the world around him and the reality he's been introduced to. Deception guides the reader through the realization of a betrayal so compelling, it's difficult to look away.  <br />	2005-03-03

That picture lead to even more controversy when two Mississippi libraries called the picture \\"pornographic\\" and banned the book from their libraries. The outrage from people around the country resulted in the library board reversing the decision and deciding to allow the book into circulation by a 5-2 vote.  <br /> <br />There's no doubt you've heard of this bestseller. With all of the controversy surrounding the nude picture, you probably haven't heard about the rest of the content in this book.  <br /> <br />First of all, you have to know what you're getting into with Jon Stewart. His type of humor isn't for everyone and it fills the pages. If you don't like his type of humor, you probably won't enjoy this book.  <br /> <br />This is one of those books you can pick up, flip through and start reading at any point. Stewart and his The Daily Show colleagues take a look at everything from the founding of America to the media. You'll find pages that look like they've been scribbled on with notes, diagrams, sidebars with little \\"factoids,\\" quizzes, discussion questions and polls all done in The Daily Show style.  <br /> <br />America (The Book) is a lot like something you'd see in Mad magazine. If you're not easily offended by foul language or a picture of nine naked people with the heads of the Supreme Court Justices superimposed over their bodies, then America (The Book) is definitely worth picking up.  <br /> <br />This book has received harsh criticism and strong praise. The media buzz and controversy of the nude picture have put this book on the map. Randomly scanning the pages at your local bookstore will give you enough info on whether this book is right for you.  <br /> <br />If you're even considering purchasing America (The Book), then you'd probably laugh non-stop while reading it. Mostpeople who wouldn't like it, wouldn't even consider reading a review for it.  <br /> <br />The \\"F\\" word and other cuss words are sprinkled throughout the pages. It doesn't make the book any funnier and actually takes away from the really good content of the book.  <br /> <br />Just remember, this isn't a bedtime story for your children.  <br />	2005-02-01

If there is one word to describe this book, it is passion.  <br /> <br />Three major themes intertwine through The Dog Fighter. First is the theme of dog fighting, of the contrived struggle between man and beast that reflects the very soul of the protagonist. Second is the theme of unrequited love, as seen through the protagonist's unquenchable desire for a woman he can never have. The third theme is that of war, of the constant revolution that engulfs the town of Cancin.  <br /> <br />It is during his first fight with a dog that the protagonist lays eyes on his love. This instant awareness of his love distracts him from the fight, minimizing the danger of the dog and emphasizing the danger of his heart. This is because the woman he falls in love with is the mistress of the Cantana, the brutal and corrupt businessman turning Cancin from a quiet fishing village into a tourist resort for Americans.  <br /> <br />It is against these businessmen that the people of Cancin revolt. These people want their fishing village to remain the way it always has been. They sabotage equipment and delay construction of the hotel which symbolizes the radical changes that this fishing village faces. The protagonist is drawn into this struggle. In the end, he must choose which side of the revolution he will support.  <br /> <br />There are no easy paths for the Dog Fighter.  <br /> <br />From the first whisperings of the Dog Fighter's grandfather to the final song sung by the Dog Fighter's love, this tale is absolutely engrossing.  <br /> <br />	2005-01-04

He spends much of his day sketching pictures for the police, often keeping Alice, his goddaughter who was brain damaged in the same boating accident that took his wife, company.  <br /> <br />The two have a sort of peace between them, his drawing calms her, and he enjoys her company, even though she doesn't seem to be able to understand a word he says. Her own conversation seems perfectly normal, save for the fact that the way she puts the words together make no sense.  <br /> <br />A woman brings a skull to him, claiming that she bought it off a street kid in Mexico. She needs to know if it is, as told, the skull of her lost husband. Alice doesn't believe her...something about her facial expressions makes the young women believe their visitor is lying, but Paul doesn't mind, knowing that though Alice is accurate, she could be picking up on anything. But soon his client will disappear, and the face that the skull reveals is uncannily like his own.  <br /> <br />When he meets Mondragon, the man blackmails him into helping the CIA. They want him to take the place of the man the skull once belonged to. Paul learns that he had a twin brother, Jude Lerner, and that Jude had managed to infiltrate a terrorist network. No one knows Jude's dead, and it's up to Paul to learn how to be his brother...everything he was, Paul needs to become, in order to destroy the network.  <br /> <br />One of the most interesting things about this story is how Paul learns about his brother...and, oddly enough, about himself. Jude, according to his ex-partner Susana, was not the most likable of men. This is a unique way of telling the story, having the protagonist step into someone else's shoes, someone with uncanny similarities (for instance, they have a lot of the same ways of sitting, same expressions, which is interesting since they never met each other) and tragicdifferences. Things he never thought himself capable of, he finds himself doing, all because Jude did.  <br /> <br />The main idea of the story...that a terrorist leader is looking to defect and that Jude/Paul is the only one he trusts enough to help him is also well done, and lends itself to many page turning moments, especially since you know that it's not going to as simple as all that, not in the least.  <br /> <br />The run down is that Lindsey once again takes an extremely interesting situation and creates a tense, intelligent, action packed read. Paul Bern is a thoughtful and very deeply written protagonist.	2005-01-04

She's just returned from a much-needed vacation following her last case with the Drug and Vice Division, which ended with a few dead bodies lying around her home.  <br /> <br />Samantha's first case involves missing Administrative Law Judge Clarissa Easterbrook.

A dark past haunts him as he longs to flee his country.  <br /> <br />Handsome Gervaise positions himself to do so with the help of staunch Jesuit Bishop Pierre de Behaine, a man recruiting missionaries to aid him in taking Christianity to the uncivilized shores of Annam, later called Vietnam. Gervaise befriends, poor yet hotheaded, teenager Henry Monange who signs on as the artist's assistant.  <br /> <br />After a long journey, the three Frenchmen find themselves in the midst of real-life Asian history, as a civil war erupts between northern and southern Annam. The two younger men are eventually sentenced to death by rebel peasants due to unpaid taxes.  <br /> <br />Gervaise steps forward to save the day and renounces Christianity for Buddhism. Behaine, who loathes Buddism and is committed to France's religious and political agenda, clashes with Gervaise.  <br /> <br />In the midst of all the tension, young Henry falls in love with a servant girl named Xuan who has been selected as French-supported Prince Anh's concubine. Conflicts abound from issues of love to issues of territory and brewing politics.  <br /> <br />Kien Nguyen's second novel allows the reader to consider the importance of similar conflict that takes place in the 1960s and 1970s in Vietnam. It takes an unflattering look at the way Christianity was introduced to places considered ignorant and uncivilized by early missionaries.  <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />	2005-01-04

He was an accountant and she was a nanny who came over from Ireland to earn money for her family back home. Throughout their intermittent dating over the next few months, they fell in love, but Mary had to leave suddenly when her mother became ill. Lyle was far from a romantic person but he was inspired to take, for him, what was a most remarkably impulsive step and fly to Ireland to propose to Mary. <br /> <br />It's years later now and neither one of them will be relating the above story themselves...or many of their other memories. It's just not their style. They do not dwell upon the past, and they have settled into a comfortable coexistence wherein Lyle grumbles and Mary soothes, humors and does everything the perfect wife is supposed to do.  <br /> <br />Lyle is retired and, after many years of never asking for a thing, Mary is making her one request. Now that their two boys are grown, Mary would like to move back to Ireland to spend her remaining years near her sister and her native land.

The memories she carries with her are unlike any held in the hearts of other children. Why so different? Oz was raised by a family of corpses.  <br /> <br />Her mother and older sister were already dead when Oz was born, but her father was still somewhat alive. Having existed in a household of corpses, however, he was forgetting more and more how to live and one day he just crossed over into death. It happened with such subtlety that Oz isn't even certain when her father died.  <br /> <br />While some may think this lifestyle odd, Oz never gave it a thought. When a person is raised in a particular manner, and knows no other, it is impossible to think of it as being abnormal.  <br /> <br />At the request of a friend, the man who saved her from her life with corpses, Oz has written the account of her childhood. And now, she sits at his graveside, ten years after his death, and writes a further account as she awaits the exhumation of what some believe will be Mr. Stark`s empty coffin.  <br /> <br />This new memoir, of sorts, will take Oz's first tale and expand upon it to share the valuable lessons she has learned since she was \\"saved\\" from her family. She tells of realizing that there are more corpses in existence than even she could have imagined and she relates her struggles with falling into the trap of becoming a corpse herself.  <br /> <br />Rather than write of corpses as the gruesome entities that fiction fans are used to, Wylene Dunbar has brought them to a new level by instilling a philosophical aspect into their existence. My Life With Corpses is a provocative tome that, though requiring a sizeable suspension of belief, will have its readers picking between the lines to relate certain aspects to reality.	2004-10-13

These stories all drift around the common theme of the End of the World. Whether it is on a global scale, or simply changing one's path through life, these World Ending events are never addressed directly. Like so many people, the characters in &quot;Not the End of the World,&quot; rarely meet their fate directly. Then again, events that often appear to be the End of the World are not really the end of the world at all.<br />In keeping with the theme of not facing an event directly, what is most intriguing about these pieces is not the central plot, but rather the peripheral occurrences. For example, in the first piece &quot;Charlene and Trudi Go Shopping,&quot; the plot is summed up by the first sentence, &quot;'I want,' Charlene said to Trudi, 'to buy my mother a birthday present.'&quot; In the end, Charlene finds a present; however, that is not what is fascinating about the story. What is fascinating are the details in the periphery hinting that the end of the world is nigh. It is a world where men see how drunk they can get before the curfew, bombs explode in the distance and the city runs out of diesel and gin. But these details do not directly relate to the selection of a birthday present. <br />In the subsequent pieces, the intriguing peripheral aspects come in the form of defining a larger picture. How are these vignettes related? On the surface, these pieces are related through the relationships between the characters of each story. There is though a deeper relationship, just waiting for reader to tease it out. <br />Despite the lack of a emphasis on plot, this collection is continuously fascinating. What &quot;Not the End of the World,&quot; has to say about life is not something that can be easily expressed. Like any good magician, Kate Atkinson does not reveal how she performs her tricks.	2004-05-12

The evening takes a nosedive, however, when a well-loved guest plunges off the deck into the waters below. <br />Annie and her cohorts are unconvinced by the ruling that the fall was an accident. And when it's followed by the apparent suicide of a woman who is found to be acquainted not only with the unfortunate cruise guest, but also a recently murdered man, it seems that the police chief may have to pay closer attention to Annie's ideas. <br />In an almost competitive partnership, the small group of amateur sleuths \\"take over\\" the investigation, determined to prove something more sinister is going on than mere coincidence. If the clues aren't pulled together in time, the next victim(s) might be closer than Annie can handle.<br />While Murder Walks the Plank is part of an ongoing series, it has the capability of standing alone at the same time that it awakens curiosity toward, what may be for some, previously unexplored tomes. Characters such as the indomitable Annie with a mind that holds an eternal fount of mystery-book-garnered knowledge, her doting and indulgent husband, and her author friend whose attitude is just as overly-confident, demanding and often-annoying as the protagonist in her own novels pull the reader inexorably into the depths of don`t-stop-`til-the-last-page readability. With the delightful cast and steadily-rising suspense that explodes in a climactic scene, Carolyn Hart's fifteenth \\"Death on Demand\\" novel holds firmly to its footing on the \\"plank\\" of success.	2004-05-12

He has fallen in love with an unsuitable woman - wealthy, elegant, powerful, Clodia's reputation for avarice rivals Messalina's. He writes poems about her, ribald, raw, romantic, poems that will make Catullus the toast of Rome, briefly, before he dies and his works are forgotten. <br />But perhaps the main characters are the Von Speyer brothers, who have traveled over the Alps and away from their homeland of Germany to Venice in 1468, where they hope to introduce movable type to this jewel of a city. They marry into Venice, Johann marrying the cool Sicilian Paola, Wendelin the fiery and sweet Venetian Lussieta. One of their greatest supporters will decide to get Wendelin to publish the works of Catullus...no matter what forces of persuasion he has to bring bear, but the publication of this erotic work will bring much trouble upon them all. <br />Sosia is not the main character, but she certainly is important. She, like Clodia, sleeps with men like some people collect coins...indiscriminately and obsessively. Unlike Clodia, she's not rich or powerful, or even particularly pretty. A Serbian who was tortured by solders and left to die, she's married to Doctor Rabino Simeon, a man she seems to veer between apathy and hate for. <br />She's also the lowest caste in Venice...a Jew, she has to were a small gold circle on her clothes. Two of her most important customers -- for us, anyway -- are two friends she engages in sort of a love triangle with: Felice Feliciano and Bruno Uguccione. Felice is a fussy, Don Juanish scribe whose true sensual delight is in the forming of words, Bruno is a naive, kind of sweet man who works for the Speyer brothers and who loves Sosia, though the more he shows it, the greater her contempt for him. <br />The other main character is Venice...Venice in all her noise, in all her scent, in all her color. She is sometimes painted as a fairy tale, a haunted realm of story and myth, more beautiful, more impossible than a dream. <br />Her marriage to the ocean, perpetrated every year by the Doge who is boated out a little ways from the land in order to drop a ring into the depths of the water to remind both parties of their vows, makes her seem like a chaste princess. Her many courtesans, and the doings of the ladies at one of her nunneries, coupled with the insular attitude of her people, their love for beauty, their ready admission that they, while not lazy, are certainly languid in their moves, paints her as a woman who has more in common with Sosia or Clodia than anyone else. <br />Though we have a lot of characterization and story outside the book world proper, particularly the bittersweet love between Wendelin and his Lussieta, the point where everything Lovric is writing seems to converge is in how the two stories - the story of Catullus first publishing his works and the story of Wendelin publishing them again seem to mirror each other in clever ways. <br />The cycle of acceptance, praise, and hatred of the poems also mirror each other. In many ways, it's as if history has repeated itself, only the technology and the faces have changed. In many ways it is a beautiful story, a vivid exploration of Venice that will color perceptions of this magical land for years to come.	2004-04-20

Run away or stay...give up or go on. A constant internal battle. <br />Hearing her mother's voice does not help the situation any. Alice expects her mother to answer her questions, explain things, give her advice. But a mother who barely understood how to cope with things herself is in no position to provide just the right words for an emotionally overloaded daughter. <br />So Alice deals in any way she can, which sometimes is by not dealing at all. Her life has become a quest for answers, for a truth that may not even exist and may not matter anyway. <br />Denial, desolation, sparks of hope and heartfelt longing are experienced by the reader as much as by the protagonist. Leslie Pietrzyk's research into suicide and its aftereffects breeds credibility and ignites an inner contemplation even for those who have not been touched by it personally.	2004-03-18

The true details of which may never be fully understood, outside of the fact that it assisted in spurring on the French Revolution.<br />In Versailles, Marie takes a posthumous journey through her own life in all its glorious disarray. From the time she first traveled to become the dauphin's bride, through the almost desperate attempts at creating an heir to the throne that had been thrust upon the unprepared couple and along the corridors of time to the their fateful end. An inevitable finale to the life of one despised by the court and ignorant to the people's most pressing needs.<br />Marie's world revolved only in the direction she chose, and if it was the wrong direction, she wasn't completely unaware of that, but rather unconcerned by it. She had not invited the turns her life had taken, but was in no position to do other than embrace them the best she knew how...never realizing she would be opening the door to such a dark future.<br />While Marie may have seemed crass to those living outside of her immediate existence, she was not completely unfeeling. She had the ability to hurt emotionally, but may not have appreciated that aspect of herself until it was too late. Much too late.<br />Versailles is not a historical account of Marie Antoinette's life. Neither is it a systematic fictional story. Instead, it is an abstract piece of literary art gracefully entwining her own retrospective autobiographical-like musings with the structural beauty that is Versailles. It is not a tome everyone will necessarily enjoy, but most will appreciate its poetic inclinations. Kathryn Davis has brought an entirely unique perspective to an age-old story.	2004-03-18
US	46619300	RTBAY87DYV6HD	0446531413	591313253	On a Night Like This	Books	4	2	6	N	N	A Moving Debut Novel	Blair Clemens believes the only person she can love is her teenage daughter. Amanda has been the one constant in Blair's life and the only thing she lives for. Only now, death is looming ever closer. As if that weren't bad enough, Blair has just found another reason to live. <br />Luke Bellingham has been given the assignment of finding the \\"lost souls\\" of his graduating class for their twenty-fifth reunion. When he comes into contact with Blair, he realizes he's found more than that. <br />The two had barely known one another in high school. She was the hippie-chick with no friends, and he was \\"Mr. Popularity.\\" All these years later, they are still worlds apart. Blair is a single mother, working as a chef. Luke is a renowned screenwriter, recently separated from his wife. Only this time, when their paths cross, it's as if fate stepped in and was telling them something. <br />Neither one could understand why they were so pulled toward each other, but the fact remained that they were. With seemingly so little time left, Blair needed to spend as much of it as she could with her daughter, but how could she deny the love she may have finally found? On the other hand, how could she be so unfair as to encourage it, knowing she didn't have a lifetime to invest? <br />This mismatched trio has so much to overcome singularly and together. Their struggles are far from simple, and outside influences continue to increase their emotional battles. Maybe fate was playing a cruel joke this time, one that came twenty-five years too late. <br />Ellen Sussman has produced a moving debut novel, stunning in its straightforward attitude. The characters' issues are real, therefore easily empathized with. The protagonist has a strength of will not often seen in works of fiction. This novel does not illicit great bouts of emotion, but rather tells the tale of one woman's courageous and unfair battle with concurrent presentations of an invaluable gift and an agonizing loss.	2004-03-18

Homesick is a refreshing look at the everyday life of a young girl as she moves from small town life to young adulthood in New York and then settles in Hollywood. <br />Sela shares the story of her family stating, \\"The Wards have always walked a fine line between conviction and orneriness...\\" She admires her father and her mother. She talks much of the way she grew up as a southern girl, the south's traditions and the legacies, girl talk sessions, cliques, church, the family restaurant, charm school and even hanging at the local Quik Stop. It's rather refreshing that the book focuses on the positives of life. <br />Sela speaks of her own life, though not with Hollywood spectacles on. She shares her climb to success but does not allow it to take over the entire telling of her story. Her claim to fame is only part of her. Her family, her history, her place of birth are so much more. <br />Homesick also touches on issues such as racism in the South, the tragedy of September 11, overindulged children and drugs. The book also details Sela's mother's death and the hardship on the family. <br />The book is generously sprinkled with photographs which tell a story themselves. You'll see the young Sela, the model, the actress, but mostly you'll see the real Sela Ward, the one who stood at her mother's knee and listened to the stories of her family.	2004-01-07

US	46619300	R2GS52UYJKJN7S	0385508603	173053619	The Bug	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A New Meaning for &quot;Computer Literacy&quot;	The Bug takes a literary approach to exploring the computer industry. Here is a novel that restores humanity to the frequently neglected and misunderstood employee of the computer industry. From the lowly quality assurance tester to the project coordinator, Ellen Ullman writes with an insider's understanding. <br />The plot of this novel is straightforward. Ethan Levin, a programmer, must eliminate a software bug. It is the story of man versus machine, a version of &quot;John Henry&quot; for the digital age. <br />In this case, it is not simply a contest to see who can perform a given task more efficiently, but a fight for survival, a tale of hunter versus hunted. At its heart, this is what The Bug comes down to in terms of what happens. It is a question of whether or not Ethan can and will defeat the bug. That such a plot is handled well, and given fresh life is a tribute to Ullman's skill as an author.<br />This freshness comes in large part through the characterization. Roberta Walton, the narrator, recalls the story while waiting for her passport to be cleared, a wait dictated by software programmed at the company she once worked for alongside Ethan Levin. She recalls the glory years at the beginning of the tech industry boom and how she lost so much in the aftermath of the tech industry crash. <br />Ethan's fatal flaw comes through slowly, but with clarity; he doubts himself in the extreme. He is defined by his self-doubt and his certainty that he is inadequate for the task at hand. These are not cardboard cutouts; they are living breathing people who cope with their situations the best they can, the only way they know how. <br />This is what the best of science fiction strives to be. Here is a tale where the technology, the science plays such a core role that if the science were removed, the story would be empty. Couple that with the well-crafted story telling and The Bug truly becomes a timeless tale. The details of computer science may have changed in the past two decades, but how people respond to the situations presented here, how they face insurmountable obstacles, that is what lives down through the ages. <br />If you have ever worked in the computer industry, you will feel a resonance in the story telling not often felt outside of Dilbert comic strips. If a loved one works in the tech industry, read this book to gain some insight into their world and the struggles they face on a daily basis. This is more than a summer beach book; this is what writers aspire to produce.	2003-09-01

The editors explain that they set out to \\"shock, titillate and thrill.\\" <br />If you have romantic ideas about love, this is not the book for you. The characters in this book say \\"I love you,\\" right before they plunge in the knife or pull on the trigger.

In the case of Oryx and Crake, that theme is the Last Man on Earth. <br />Despair frequently dominates such tales. That is the obvious, most direct story. In Oryx and Crake, Margaret Atwood rises above that to create a tale of hope in the face of that despair. <br />The Last Man, Snowman, takes care of a group of genetically modified people, Crakers, who are ignorant of human civilization. They have all the innocence of Adam and Eve before the fall. <br />Crake created them as a fresh start to civilization, or rather, as a fresh start to humanity without the burdens of civilization (i.e. war, hatred, jealousy, love, creativity, ambition, pride, etc.) Snowman doles out information about how to survive as myths revolving around instructions given by Oryx and Crake, the parents and gods of the Crakers. <br />As Oryx and Crake, opens, Snowman is a long way down the road of despair and insanity. He lives apart from the Crakers, not wanting to disturb the delicate balance of their primitive idyllic existence. When he is not interacting with the Crakers, Snowman reminisces about his life before the end of the world. <br />It is through this nostalgic window that Snowman tells the body of the story. Here he shows life in an increasingly malleable world. Pigs are bred to host spare human parts, including brain tissue. Chicken breasts are grown separate from the rest of the bird. Dogs are combined with wolves to create killing machines that appear friendly until the moment of attack. Through BlyssPluss, a pill which enhances sexual prowess, cures every sexually transmitted disease and is a perfect contraceptive, civilization engages in the ultimate orgy. <br />If God expelled Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden for eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, then perhaps the only way to return to Eden is to purge knowledge and regain ignorance. In this case, ignorance is BlyssPluss. <br />Biblical analogies abound in Oryx and Crake. The genetically modified Crakers originally reside in a controlled environmental dome called Paradice. The Crakers have no knowledge of good or evil; they copulate freely when the females are in heat without any jealousy or love. <br />Snowman can be compared to any number of biblical figures, including Satan, Moses and Jesus. Oryx plays roles reminiscent of Eve, the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene. Crake plays the role of God and Satan in all guises. Such metaphors are inevitable and intriguing to contemplate. <br />In Oryx and Crake, Margaret Atwood creates a compelling, literary science fiction novel. The trinity of Oryx, Crake and Snowman form a perfectly ill-balanced triangle. Against the post-apocalyptic backdrop of genetically blended creatures surviving the final plague, this depth of the various relationships is explored through the eyes of Snowman, the lone survivor. This well-told tale is one of hope, despite (or perhaps because of) the despair of one man alone.	2003-07-25

The Sparrow women - for centuries, residents of the small town of Unity haven't been sure whether to be frightened of them or revere them. One thing is certain, however, they are awe-inspiring. <br />Most people despise the number 13, but the Sparrows, with their mysterious ways, thrive on it. It can't be determined whether the women are witches or simply derive from an eternally &quot;gifted&quot; line of blood. <br />But on their thirteenth birthday each and every one of them woke up just a little bit different from the day before. The &quot;gifts&quot; range from feeling no pain to the ability to make food from anything, being able to sense lies to seeing others' dreams or deaths. And if that isn't enough, there has never been a male child born to a Sparrow woman. <br />Stella Sparrow Avery is the thirteenth in the line and she has just gained the ability to see the deaths of people. She is also the only one never to have lived in Cake House or the town of Unity itself. <br />In fact, her mother, Jenny, has kept the knowledge of her family roots from her and the contact of her grandmother, Elinor. This is all about to change, however, when Stella sees the death of a young woman and begs her father to warn her. <br />In an attempt to do the right thing for once, Stella's father goes to the police, but is then held under suspicion of murder when the woman dies as predicted days later. To keep Stella away from the media and gossip, Jenny is forced to send her to live in Unity where many doors are opened into the past...and the future. <br />Alice Hoffman's experience as a writer shines through undeniably in &quot;The Probable Future.&quot; Her characters are far from one-dimensional names on paper. They are living individuals instilling countless emotions as they face their separate demons of lost love, soul-searching, fear of admitting wrong and the desperate attempt to create something impossible. <br />The thought-provoking journeys of the living intertwine withthe ghostly paths of those who have gone before leading to a decidedly tender culmination. <br />The Sparrow women are admirable indeed.	2003-07-25

They're special. Different. But the biological parents want their kids back. <br />Maximum, Ozymandias, Matthew, Icarus, Peter and Wendy aren't just your average kids. They can fly. And they're really part human, part bird as the result of torturous experiments they suffered at the School. <br />But when their flock is broken up, Frannie slips into a deep depression. Kit attempts to move on with his life, without Frannie and the children. The children struggle to fit in even though they're so awkwardly out of place that it hurts. <br />Pretty soon some old habits of the evil kind come into play and the kids are running, or flying, for their lives. There's only one place they truly feel safe and it's far away. Almost out of reach. The Lake House. <br />As they fight just to stay alive, they learn there's a bigger reason they're being pursued. It's not just because they're scientific phenomenons. They're needed to carry on a much bigger role. One that extends to everyone from past presidents to geniuses. <br />If you're expecting an Alex Cross novel, this isn't it. Readers coming to the book looking for the fiction that drives our favorite James Patterson character are going to be disappointed. But if you can look at the novel itself, with none of those stereotyped expectations that this is going to be the type of Patterson novel you're used to, then you're in for a good read.

Now we find Bosch in the private sector, getting his P.I. license like so many cops do after they leave the police department. <br />He really has no interest in pursuing a life as a private investigator, though. Only when an old case falls back into his lap does he start nosing around in classic Bosch style. <br />Four years ago, a production assistant was murdered and the pose of her body haunted Bosch. When he went to a movie set to ask routine questions about her death, he got caught up in a shootout as armed robbers took off with two million dollars. <br />Robbery-Homicide took over the case and that was the end of his involvement. The cops investigating the case were involved in a shootout, leaving one dead and the other paralyzed. The money was never recovered. The murder never solved. <br />And as Bosch tries to figure out what happened, to close just one more case, he instead finds nothing but opposition standing in his way. He's bullied by former colleagues, doors aren't as open for him as they were when he donned a badge and there seems to be an even bigger presence involved in the case. Even bigger than the LAPD. <br />He feels like he's getting nowhere but someone's sure worried. He's being followed, lied to and shot at. And he has no idea what for. <br />The Harry Bosch we've gotten used to in the past seven books of this series is quite different from the Bosch in this eighth novel. He's taking on a dark persona at times but still has that good old Harry heart that makes him a lovable character. <br />The end is so surprising, Michael Connelly could actually end the series on this note. But we sure hope he doesn't. Fans will be anxious to see a ninth Bosch book with this new twist.	2003-07-10

High Fashion Devil	Meet the devil...Miranda Priestly, editor in chief of Runway magazine. Ask anyone who works either directly or indirectly with her and they might, in a split second of thinking-before-speaking, admit she's the worst boss ever - demanding, overbearing, unappreciative. The list goes on and on. <br />Of course, then the phenomenon of \\"Paranoid Turnaround\\" will kick in and they will begin spouting what a truly extraordinary person she is. Try telling that to Andrea Sachs, her new junior assistant. <br />In desperate need of a job, and hoping to land something as an editorial assistant, Andrea left resumés with several magazine houses. When she received the call for an interview, off she went, the Miss America of fashion-cluelessness, to the Elias-Clark building and the devil herself.<br />Apparently, Andrea's obvious lack of knowledge evidenced by her mismatched choice of interview-appropriate clothing wasn't an important factor because she landed the job \\"a million girls would love to have.\\" Good or bad? She would soon find out. <br />Prior to becoming Miranda Priestly's assistant, Andrea had a boyfriend, a best friend and a life which included spending time with them and her family. This, however, was unthinkable while working at Runway. <br />Miranda and her needs had to come first, in fact, they should be the only thing that exist in a person's life. How could anyone possibly think that friends and family meant more than finding an elusive restaurant review in an unknown paper, having a fresh breakfast delivered every 10 minutes (throwing away each previous one when the new one arrives) until Miranda finally waltzes through the door or updating the Bulletin every six seconds as each new phone message arrives? <br />But for all of the humiliation and torture of working for Miranda, after a year a person could basically choose where they wished to work next. And Miranda would pull her strings and make it happen. <br />Andrea wanted to write for the New Yorker so badly she could taste it, but would she be able to hold up under the stress for the first year...even when it meant losing everything that was dear to her? <br />Author Lauren Weisberger has an amazing talent of her own - balancing humor and cynicism with an underlying seriousness. The story of Andrea's career as Miranda's tortured assistant will have the reader bouncing back and forth between laughing out loud, wanting to throttle Ms. \\"No-one-and-nothing-matters-in-the-world-but-Me\\" and even wanting to smack some sense into the semi-brainwashed Andrea herself. <br />Never once will the reader find the story dull as Andrea is forced to do impromptu karaoke in order to get through turnstiles, run down slushy sidewalks on four-inch stilettos multiple times until the coffee she is fetching actually makes it back into the building warm and is constantly forced to endure fierce degradation while wishing she could speak her sarcastic comments out loud.	2003-07-07

Max Barry fulfills that obligation with ease in Jennifer Government. From the first chapter, where Hack Nike, a Merc Officer (Merchandise Distribution Officer) is hired by the VP of Guerrilla Marketing as a mercenary to kill customers in order to build up street credibility for the newest Nikes, the story takes off and never lets up. <br />This novel is enjoyable on a variety of levels. As an action story, the plot moves fast and has many unanticipated twists. As a character story, the protagonists come across as real people deserving of support and sympathy. As a science fiction novel, the treatment of the concepts is thought-provoking, even, if not entirely original. As a stylistic piece, this novel slips in puns both subtle and blatant. The book will stimulate a wealth of thoughts and reactions.<br />The characterization is executed smoothly. Every character does what he or she thinks is best, often with disastrous results. After unwittingly signing a contract to kill customers for Nike, Hack goes straight to the police. They offer to help by filling the contract on his behalf, for an appropriately exorbitant fee. When the police, in turn, outsource the killings, events spiral out of control for everyone involved. <br />As chaos ensues, the plot gallops along at a breakneck pace. Characters hop between Europe, Australia and America. As the climax is reached at identical malls continents apart, it is at times a little confusing in keeping track of everyone and what they are doing. Fortunately, Barry is a skilled storyteller who never misses a beat in the midst of the chaos. This sense of an uncontrollable plot is often reminiscent of Catch 22. <br />In terms of social commentary, Jennifer Government is a biting satire. Despite the humor and hyperbole, the warnings offered by this story are quite sincere. As corporations continue to grow in size and power, they have the potential of becoming a threat to the very consumers who support them. These dire warnings, despite being couched in satire, are no less serious than those offered by Orwell's 1984. <br />Overall, this is an excellent novel. All the aspects of a well-told story mesh perfectly. The only drawback to this novel is that with the pace, the narrative becomes slightly confusing, forcing the reader to pull out of the story to regroup. Despite this, Jennifer Government is an entertaining novel from the first page to the last.	2003-07-07

The character of Charlie Monk is not sure, either. All he knows is that his memories have been tampered with and his only hope of survival lies with the person who did the tampering. <br />Dr. Susan Flemyng discovered a way to enhance the memories of patients who suffered with long-term amnesia using visual memory implants. Funding for the research came through the Pilgrim Group. She never questioned who they were until they forced her to use her knowledge in a top-secret government project that needed the type of tweaking she could do to visual memory. <br />In Charlie Monk's reality (the one he thinks he has always known), he has been trained as a secret government agent whose specialty is the prevention of terrorism. His job is to obey orders with no questions and no regrets and he has remained true to that tenet. <br />Until a persistent memory of a girl he used to know refuses to leave him alone because, as strong as the memory remains, he cannot recall anything specific about this girl other than her name. When he thinks he sees her on a mission, he goes against orders. When he wakes up after being detained by his superiors, he learns that his life might not be what he thought it was. <br />Nothing is what you expect it to be in The Discrete Charm of Charlie Monk. With carefully chosen scenes and descriptions, David Ambrose makes the reader question the reality of what is being read. His craftiness prevents the reader from discovering the truth and will create questions that you don't want to think about or have the answer to. If you're looking for a book that will keep you guessing and reading until the early hours of the morning, this is the book for you.	2003-07-07

But glimpses are shown through the eyes of Laura Seton, whose identity is rather vague but it is assumed that she was his girlfriend. <br />Gage responds violently to his death sentence, even trying to attack the judge as he is removed from the courtroom. His primal rage is revealed and lingers throughout the book, even though he was executed and is known to be dead. His image fills the pages of The Anniversary. <br />Thirty-five-year-old Callie Thayer arrives home to find a white envelope stuck in her door. Melanie White also receives an envelope as does Diane Massey. It is received on April 5th, the anniversary of Steven Gage's execution. The note states simply, \\"Happy Anniversary. I haven't forgotten you.\\" <br />Callie Thayer is a single mom, dating a cop, trying to restart a life that had obviously included a tortured and depressing past. She has a ten-year-old daughter. She's attending college and working. They live in the quiet town of Merritt. At least, it was quiet until April 5th. <br />Melanie White is a lawyer, living happily single, yet engaged, in New York City. Melanie was Gage's lawyer for his appeal following the announcement of the death sentence. She did not succeed in the appeal and he was ultimately executed. <br />Diane Massey is the accomplished writer who wrote the book \\"The Vanishing Man,\\" an account of Gage's horrendous crimes. Her book is used throughout The Anniversary to provide clues to the current situation. <br />The clues begin early in the book and allow you to build your suspicions. There are numerous characters introduced that could be him, enough so that you sometimes feel a bit cheated on being able to pick the real killer. There are disappointments along the way as you find that it couldn't possibly be who you thought it was and then your cravings are satisfied as the ending answers all your many questions.	2003-07-07

The heat and noise inside the walls of the buildings convinced Lilly even more that she needed to put an end to the expansion of textiles in Lowell. <br />Only, she didn't realize that many people liked the changes that were happening to their town. Many of the farmers had received a tidy sum for their small farms and were enjoying a freedom they had never known before. Many of the girls who worked in the mills had the independence that having their own paycheck provided and they were happy about that even though they had to work long hard hours to get it. <br />Tracie Peterson and Judith Miller do a wonderful job of telling the struggle of letting go of the past and embracing the future. They take the reader through all of Lilly's fears, doubts and convictions. We see her grow in her faith and grow as a person. An easy, yet terrific read.	2003-07-07

Owney decides right then and there that no one will ever steal from him again. <br />This compelling fictionalized autobiography reveals the life of infamous Irish gangster Owen Madden. In 1902, at the age of ten, his impoverished family sets sail for New York City, minus his father who died from an injury sustained in a boxing match before their ship sailed from England. <br />Young Owney soon joins up with Jewish Tammany boss, Monk Eastman. Monk is fond of him and the two become almost inseparable. He takes Owney under his wing and begins to teach him \\"the trade.\\" <br />In true gangster lingo and style, Owney works his way up through the ranks of the mob, planning one day to be at the top himself. The ruthless Madden takes care of his mother, younger brother and sister while pursuing and cultivating his life of crime. He escapes to the rooftops of their tenement building where he tenderly cares for his pigeons, but also uses these birds to practice how to quickly kill something painlessly. <br />Owney soon begins to rub elbows with some of the most notorious gangsters.

Wracked with emphysema and other ailments left from many surgeries to repair bullet wounds, Madden suffers in his old age.

Books	5	2	4	N	N	Forget the Rat Poison and Join the Rat Race	Pontius Feeb -- or Ponty, as Nelson has dubbed him -- has authored such indistinguished historical oddities as Where did Amerigo?: Vespucci and the New World and Czech and Sea: Dvorak's Voyages to America. He also writes for trade journals. Perhaps you've heard of them? The Journal of Plasma Beam Annealing and Bar Code Solutions. However, in spite of all the credits on Feeb's unimpressive resume, he's just been fired, and given his dire straits, he'll do anything. <br />So, after running down a cop (while lying down in his Ford Tempo), then shacking up with some college kids, Feeb writes a novel. The tome which he produces is an adventure entitled Death Rat, a tall tail about a rat with a long tale, for this rat is 6 feet long and it menaced the small town of Holey, Minnesota, back in the 1800s. <br />Now, Feeb is an old Feeb and old Feebs aren't exactly marketable as rugged and adventuresome. So, Ponty recruits Jack Ryback, a co-worker at Medieval Burger, to pose as him and market the book. Ryback, being familiar with Ponty's work, sells the book to a publisher as a work of non-fiction. And thus begins the adventures and mishaps of Jack and Ponty's attempt to fool Minnesota and all of America into believing Death Rat is a work of non-fiction. <br />Mike Nelson's Death Rat is populated with a wonderfully wild and quirky cast of characters, from the jealous Gus Bromstad who'll stop at nothing to ruin Ponty and the success of Death Rat to Bromstad's four bumbling \\"great\\" Danes from Den Institut Dansk, from the homey, unexcitable folks of Holey to the always over-the-top, and master of funk, King Leo (whom you can also call the Sovereign Ruler of Groove, the Pharoah of Funk, Maharaja of the Mojo, Caeser the Pleaser, or the Exchequer of the Milk Chocolate Soul). And then, of course, there's King Leo's entourage: Sir Shock-a-Lot, Tarzan Moe, Billy Moonbeam, Kaptain Kinetic, et. al. <br />The question is, will Bromstad reveal Jack and Ponty's little secret, or will they be successful in pulling off their deception?	2003-06-19

A man he shot, ten years earlier, walking the streets as if nothing happened. How could it be possible? <br />Then Reacher is asked to join an off-the-books mission that the government has set up to rescue an undercover agent, who has fallen into the hands of a vicious man. Quickly, Reacher learns that his new nemesis, Zachary Beck, may be linked to the man Reacher thought was dead. <br />The carefully devised mission initially goes as intended. He finds himself staying in Beck's house, first as a prisoner, and then as a member of Beck's own security force. <br />But before long, the intricate plan starts to crumble, as one criminal after another sets their sights on Reacher. With Beck's innocent family in the house, and a missing agent to locate, Reacher has his work cut out for him. <br />As the house turns into a war zone, Reacher must find a way to persevere. How can he take Beck and his boss down without innocent blood shed? <br />\\"Persuader\\" is a uniquely written novel with a likeable main character, despite his violent outbursts and imperfect past. From an intense kidnapping in the first chapter, to the suspenseful climax of the story, Lee Child keeps the tension high.	2003-06-19

Cold, wet and in a lot of pain, she can't figure out if she's dead, and if this is just what death is like, or if she's been in some sort of accident. Soon she figures out she's been abducted and she begins trying to figure out how long she's been held prisoner. <br />French has created a chilling worst case scenario tale with fabulous descriptions that will have readers gripping their seats and biting their nails. The emotions and thoughts that are depicted through Abigail are very well-written and realistic. The more Abigail tries to get her abductor to talk to her and to try to get an explanation of why, where and when from him, the more dead end answers she's given. <br />His deep, hoarse laugh echoes in her ears when he leaves her every few hours.

Abigail finds herself on the ground with a pain in her neck, literally. The noose snapped and she was cut loose when she hears her abductor coming for her. She barely makes an escape. <br />The police can't seem to find any evidence or leads to catch her abductor and they are not even sure if they believe her story at this point.

Wouldn't a second time be even easier?	2003-06-19

What would you do if you tried to locate this company, but could not find out anything about it besides the name and a basic street address with no house number? <br />In \\"Money For Nothing,\\" Josh Redmont decides to cash those checks. Every month. For seven years. And stops thinking much about it until the day a stranger shows up to let Josh know he has now been activated. When Josh seems confused, the stranger tells him that the original contact, Nimrin, has retired and that he, Levrin, will now be his contact. <br />Josh meets up with Nimrin later and he explains that he recruited Josh and others as sleeper agents nine years earlier. The monthly checks were to go to Nimrin and they did until he was forced into retirement. By accepting the checks, Josh implied to those in charge that he knew what was going on. <br />When Levrin activated him and he did not refuse, Josh became involved in a plot to assassinate a visiting leader. The only way out now is kill or be killed. They killed one of the others who cashed the checks, leaving one other person not yet activated. Josh decides to find this individual, off-off-off Broadway actor Mitch Robbie, in order to warn him of what is about to happen. <br />At first scared, and then later intrigued, Mitch sees beyond the kill or be killed argument. He hatches a plot to keep the original plan from taking place and forces Josh beyond his myopic view of the situation. He shows Josh that they have the chance to regain control of their lives and keep the assassination from happening. And once again Josh signs on despite himself. <br />Even though this is a plot-driven novel, the characters stand out as original and real. The reader experiences Josh's fear and indecision and is more than willing to ride along with him as he tries to discover exactly who, and what, he is up against. <br />Westlake's addition of the actor Mitch Robbie is inspired as well as hilarious. Mitch brings a note of humor to the book, often acting as the spur for the slow-to-work-it-out Josh. Even the side characters, though somewhat stereotypical in the long view, have personality quirks in the short view that make them human and almost likeable.	2003-06-19

A beloved priest has been crucified in a most horrible way and the autopsy reveals an incredible secret that Father Patrick Walsh never wanted his parishioners to learn of. <br />In order to find out what dark reasons hide behind the motive for Father Patrick's death, Rourke must \\"shake down\\" the other priests of Holy Rosary, including his own brother, Father Paul, who is plainly bearing a heavy burden of his own guilt. <br />At the same time, two young girls have been raped and murdered. And the young Negro chimney sweep who has been tried and convicted now faces execution in the newfangled electric chair. But did he really commit the ugly crimes or is he dealing with an occurrence common in the world of 1927 - conviction based on circumstantial evidence and skin color? <br />Closer still to Rourke's own back door are the threats to his girlfriend, popular silent screen actress Remy Lelourie. What starts out with notes written in blood and lipstick escalates into things Rourke doesn't even want to imagine. And is determined to keep from happening. <br />Sleep deprivation is well-known by Rourke as he attempts to unravel the mysteries behind these crimes...even more so when he realizes there may be a tenuous thread connecting them all. <br />Penelope Williamson not only knows how to create suspense, she also has what it takes to involve the readers into the lives of her characters in such a way as to make it possible to care what happens to them. Those combined accomplishments make \\"Wages of Sin\\" a difficult book to put down. With practically each chapter, a new possibility is opened up as to what might be driving the person(s) involved in the threats and murders and the tension grows to nearly insurmountable levels. <br />What is touted as the top case, however, is not the one that the reader will find most enthralling. The mystery of the death of FatherPatrick Walsh is an interesting one, indeed, but those characters just don't bring out the same emotions as the one surrounding executed seventeen-year-old chimney sweep Titus Dupre. <br />This definitely deserves top billing. Those involved in this particular plot are easier for the reader to empathize with and some aspects are so well described, one will feel like an actual witness to the events. <br />Putting all these factors together adds up to \\"Wages of Sin\\" being an excellent read. Williamson definitely has what it takes to compete in this genre.	2003-06-19

Maybe the changes will be welcomed and cherished. Maybe they will be full of regret and despair. Or maybe it will be a life filled with moments of both, making the memories bittersweet. <br />Professor Nicholas Van Tassel of Thrupp College has experienced just such an event. Up to that particular moment in his life, he didn't realize he was missing anything. <br />However, when a fire in a hotel restaurant propels Van Tassel out into the cold, he happens to look up and see a striking woman standing across the street. An instant obsession forms on his part and for him she will become the thing he must have, no matter what it will cost him. <br />The narration of this story actually takes place sixty-four years after it begins in December 1899. Van Tassel is traveling to his sister's funeral and is afforded much time to ponder the events which have unfolded since he met Etna Bliss, the woman who would be the cause of his greatest joy...and grief. <br />Circumstances have brought him to a point where he feels it necessary to provide an explanation to his son. This he will do via a journal that chronicles the years shared with Etna and the emotions brought on by them (sprinkled with a bit of hindsight commentary and other present-day notations). <br />Van Tassel's writing will serve more than just the intended purpose. It will also offer him the opportunity to purge his soul of his lifelong obsession. <br />Anita Shreve's account of one man's fixation on fully possessing a woman he can never truly know, understand or be loved by is fraught with passion, perfidy and pain. <br />It is told in the first person, so even the reader is never privy to what happens in the mind of Etna Bliss. This can become frustrating at times when introduced to a mysterious incident in Etna's past, which so wholly affects her present and future life with Van Tassel. The reader experiences a need to know which remains unfulfilled except for the explanation formed only in the imagination of Van Tassel based on his own similar, yet more desperate, need to know. <br />An overconfident reader will not enjoy the book based on a preconceived idea that the outcome is obvious. One should refrain from making assumptions based on what seems like blatant foreshadowing and simply absorb the story as it is being written by Professor Van Tassel. Some of the strived-for emotional reactions will be missed otherwise. <br />Read without supposition, All He Ever Wanted will do more than provide a short escape from reality into the world of fiction. It will bring about the reader's own quest for what might have been had that one moment in their own life been handled just a little bit differently...or never have happened at all.	2003-06-06

At times humorous and at times horrifying, this novel moves fluidly between the past and the present to tell a story unlike any other.	2003-06-06

Now Daisy must come to terms with her future and Lottie must come to terms with her past. <br />Jojo Moyes has a way of drawing the reader into the story, of making the reader turn the page to find out what happens next. The characters, with all of their flaws and the hardships they face, ring true for the reader. Although part one focuses on Lottie, part two focuses on Daisy so that we see the changes in the people and the town of Merham from an outsider's perspective.

In the case of Blood is the Sky, both the beginning and the ending are handled skillfully. <br />The novel starts with an act of creation, as Alex McKnight begins rebuilding his father's cabin, late, much too late in the early autumn of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The close of the novel reflects the opening in that something new is also being created. Both the opening and closing reflect the recurrent theme of the novel. <br />Thematically, this story deals with how people respond to crises. Alex rebuilds his dead father's cabin after it burned to the ground. Vinnie rushes to the aid of his younger brother at the first hint of trouble. Other characters respond more desperately with violent acts of vengeance, long after the moment of crisis has passed. No matter what choice is made, though, all the characters follow through with their actions, never giving up. <br />One of the hallmarks of good writing is having characters who are actively working toward a solution to their problem. Whether it is trying to survive the next five minutes, cold, wet and lost in the Canadian wilderness as killers hunt them down, or dealing with the people who killed your children, these characters all keep moving forward. All the characters have their own goals. <br />Unless time spent with the characters sitting in thoughtful repose benefits the story, (i.e. is interesting for the reader) those scenes are minimized. Several pages will be devoted to the passage of a few minutes, when those minutes are vital to a character. On the other hand, the passage of several days where little occurs in relation to the story are dismissed with a brief paragraph of two. The pacing of the story works admirably. <br />Overall, this is an excellent mystery novel. The characters, setting, pacing and theme all work together. This is a captivating book that will stimulate the reader's imagination.<br />Steve Hamilton's Blood is in the Sky, is a well-written mystery. Focusing on the characters and the setting, this story's plot in no way feels forced or contrived. The plot moves forward naturally from the actions and choices made by the characters.	2003-06-06

Though the characters may have feelings that are often ambiguous, the style has a clarity that pulls the reader into the story. <br />Often in a collection of stories, there is little to indicate how or why these particular stories fit together. Such is not the case here. Thematically, the stories in A Few Short Notes on Tropical Butterflies overlap quite a bit. The first story, &quot;The Hill Station,&quot; crosses cultural boundaries, expresses an intimate familiarity with medical professions and explores the emotional isolation of a career professional. Variations on these themes are treated throughout the stories in this collection. <br />In exploring these themes, the protagonists are frequently introspective. They think and remember and think some more before taking the one decisive action that is pivotal to their lives and the climax of the story. These intensely analytical characters express their emotions through their obsessions. They are beetle collectors, mountain climbers and third world volunteer doctors. <br />As focused as the themes are between the stories, the settings are diverse. From the top of the Himalayas to the American Midwest, the author captures the essence of these locales and many more besides. <br />Each location has its own distinct personality that is conveyed by the vegetation and the weather, the sounds and smells, even the very feel of the wind and sun. All this adds richness and depth to this fine collection of stories. <br />The stories in this collection capture the poignant solitude that everyone facesin their lives from time to time. This is the bright start for Murray's writing career. <br />Overall, this collection of poignant stories is a treat. They show growth occurring through painful realizations of inadequacy.	2003-06-06

On her deathbed, her mother clears much of the mystery for Nova, helping her come to peace with her past and what brought her to the present. <br />I'll Watch the Moon takes Nova back to 1948 when she was just nine-years-old. She lives with her mother and fourteen-year-old brother, Dewey, in a boarding house owned by her Aunt Dortha who took them in after Nova's father died in the arms of another woman. Nova didn't know the reason then, but that was just one of many mysteries she came to understand later. <br />Dewey had big dreams. He loved watching the sky, the moon and the stars. Nova loved hearing Dewey talk about his dreams of being the first person on the moon. She loved everything about Dewey. They were as close as a brother and sister could be. So close, that Dewey's friends had nicknamed her Tag because she always tagged along. <br />But on one fateful day, she didn't tag along. Polio had reared its ugly head and it seemed eager to spread in the water. Therefore Nova's mom always made them stop swimming at the first outbreak of the season. But that's exactly where Dewey and his friends were going - swimming. That one disobedience triggers many life changes. For Nova, she only realizes the extent of the effect in hind sight. <br />Because of the absence of a father, Nova was always on the look out for a new pa. A neighbor, Thomas Diel, was her first choice. He had been in the army during the war and was kind and came to visit the boarding house regularly. Nova was convinced he came to see her mother, but her mother would have nothing to do with the attentions of Thomas Diel. <br />So Nova turned her sights on Josef, one of the boarders. He had moved to the states after the war. The scars on his face told only part of his story. There were much deeper scars on the inside that he kept hidden most of the time. One scar Nova knew about was that his entire family had been killed when the Nazi's occupied his native Poland. Her mom couldn't understand how he could still believe God was good and gracious after all he had witnessed and been through during his stay in a Nazi concentration camp. <br />She had been through things herself that Nova learned of later that had destroyed her faith and her willingness to love, but Josef told her something that stuck with her for the rest of her life - if he was God, he wouldn't change anything, but he would understand why. <br />Ann Tatlock weaves the lives of several people together in this touching tale of life, faith and love in the midst of pain and suffering. You'll cry for the pain they were dealt, but also for the joy they found. Tatlock shows how the people in our lives stay with us and influence us forever - even after they're gone. <br />Sometimes it's a comforting memory and sometimes we have to forgive and make peace. She also shows us how in hindsight, we realize why some people are the way they are.	2003-06-06

It started with talk of an opening day. You will be asking, Opening day of what? <br />Rosenfelt will lead you to believe that it might be opening day of baseball season - but will then tell you that what he really meant was opening day of the dog park that he's now taking his dog, Tara, to visit. <br />You'll hope this is not a sign of what is to come. And it won t be. <br />You will learn, through that opening day fiasco, that Andy Carpenter loves animals and rescued Tara from death row of an animal shelter. He also has rescued a human from death row, Willie Miller. <br />In fact, Mr. Miller's name comes up often enough that you will wonder if he's the murderer in this tale. You'll also be introduced to the love interest in Andy's life, Laurie Collins - an ex-cop turned P.I., and now works for Andy. <br />Laurie comes into the story with a big bang, announcing that Alex Dorsey, a cop that Laurie had once provided evidence against, has been killed - decapitated and then set on fire. Not really sure in what order. Alex had been the reason Laurie quit the force and became a private investigator. <br />Andy is then confronted with Geoffrey Stynes who comes to his office, confesses to killing Alex Dorsey and asks for representation. Andy declines. <br />Shortly after, Oscar Garcia is arrested. Andy, believing that Geoffrey Stynes is the killer, takes Oscar's case. <br />Just one more arrest in this case - Laurie. Oscar is freed and Laurie is brought up on murder charges. Andy ends up representing Laurie at her trial. His somewhat sarcastic sense of humor follows him right into the courtroom. <br />From there on, expect the unexpected. There are more surprises to come. <br />David Rosenfelt allowed us to know Andy on a very personal level as the book is written in first person. The good part of that was being able to eye every detail through Andy and thus have the same opportunity to figure out the case.	2003-06-06

The year is 1096, a time of dukes and nobles. A time of servants and jesters. <br />Lord Baldwin and his knight, Norcross, wreak havoc on the people in Hugh's village. Rapes and murders occur and no one can do anything about it. <br />Hugh feels his calling is to join Raymond of Toulouse in the fight for freedom. He leaves his beloved wife, Sophie, to embark on his journey to the Holy Land. <br />Only after his return from brutal battle does he find that his son has been murdered and his wife has been abducted from their village. Hugh knows who's responsible and he vows to bring his wife back to their village. <br />Along the way, Hugh meets a maiden named Emilie. Lady Emilie actually saves his life and takes him back to her court, the castle of the King of France's cousin. She knows he will not stay long, he is in search of his wife. But she offers to help Hugh with his mission. <br />Her idea is simple - Hugh will become a jester to get inside the court and free Sophie from her captors. Her plan, he soon discovers, is much more difficult to carry out. <br />What no one knows is that the real evil lies far deeper than a court wanting to destroy a tiny village. And that evil is linked to the most holy relic known to man. <br />Hugh, once a simple innkeeper, is about to take on the biggest challenge of his life. Many lives will be lost, loved ones, dear friends, fellow soldiers - all for him and all because of him. <br /> James Patterson brings a new twist to his thrillers. This time, he takes readers into the historical fiction genre with a very detailed, and sometimes gruesome, account of one man's struggle to break the system to become free. <br />Patterson has taken a detour from the Alex Cross series as well as the Women's Murder Club books with this novel. This is a refreshing take on a genre that is often lacking when authors try to recreate these times. <br />The Jester is not a feelgood tale of lords and ladies. The image of violence is vivid and the language is strong. The work he and Andrew Gross have created is a thriller all the way, with an added mix of love, hope and determination.	2003-05-19

Her husband, Jim, died shortly before Christmas from a brain tumor. Before he passed away, he made sure she wouldn't be alone. She would always be protected. Even if her protector was a dog. <br />Julie listens to Christmas music on Christmas Eve, she's put up the tree and is pretending to celebrate the holiday. She knows Jim would've wanted it that way. Although she's not a bitter widow, she does feel like the holiday doesn't matter much anymore. Not without Jim. <br />That's when the present arrives. <br />A letter from Jim and a whiney puppy. Julie can't believe her husband bought her a puppy to keep her company, knowing the brain tumor wouldn't allow Jim to be with her much longer. <br />The prologue sets the stage for a Nicholas Sparks first: a romantic tale filled with danger, suspense and even murder. <br />We pick back up with Julie four years later. Her puppy, now a full-grown Great Dane named Singer, is more than just a dog. He's her companion, a typical furry member of the family. <br />Now Julie's trying to move on with her life. Her time with Jim was special but he wanted her to find someone else she could love. He even said so in the letter she received that Christmas Eve four years ago. <br />She knew getting back into the dating scene wouldn't be easy but she describes the guys she's been out with lately as \\"boring\\" or just a plain \\"pervert.\\" <br />Then walks in Richard Franklin. He seems to have it all. Good looks. Charm. Success. And he's quite the romantic. <br />But there's also Mike Harris, Jim's best friend, who's had his eye on Julie for years. He can't even work up the nerve to ask her out and if they started going out it would be awkward, she thinks. <br />All of a sudden, Julie finds herself from batting a big, fat zero in the dating department to being torn between two men. When she makes her decision, she and the man of her dreams are thrust into the world ofa psychotic killer. A man who won't take \\"no\\" for an answer and who won't let anything - or anyone - stand in his way. Even if that means murder. <br />In the Author's Note section in the back of the book, Nicholas Sparks talks about how he came up with the idea for The Guardian and how the book went through \\"eight major revisions\\" before it was complete. His hard labor paid off as he's written a real page-turner sure to delight his dedicated fans and land him a whole new fan base at the same time. <br />The characters are so real, you're horrified for Julie, you're terrified of the killer and you feel the pain of loss when some of the characters die. Singer, the Great Dane, is even a true-to-life character. A rarity for a dog to be a believable character in today's fiction. Sparks has also nailed the stalker's character so well, it's downright creepy. <br />Let's cross our fingers that Sparks continues down this new path of romance coupled with suspense and danger. It really suits him.	2003-05-19

Pete Braga, long-time family enemy of the McMichaels, has been murdered. <br />McMichael's lieutenant offers him the case but lets him know he can decline. He thinks it over for just a moment and accepts the case. <br />McMichael is now in \\"Cold Pursuit\\" of Pete Braga's killer, the same man who killed his grandfather in 1952. Braga was an ambitious man in life, with a net worth of a little over 12 million dollars. He served as mayor of San Diego, was the Port Commissioner and part of the Tuna Boat Foundation. <br />The elder McMichael worked for Braga on his tuna fishing boat. They had argued over wages and got into a physical brawl, which ended with the death of McMichael's grandfather. Braga claimed it was self-defense and never served any time for the death. <br />The McMichaels believed that he killed in cold blood. The feud continued with the Bragas believing that as payback, Gabriel McMichael, then thirteen-years-old, attacked Pete Braga's son, Victor, and beat him so bad that he was left with the mentality of a ten-year-old. <br />Tom McMichael grew up knowing both sides but never having proof of either. He had once been in love with Braga's granddaughter and both families had ended the young lovers' affair. <br />Tom eventually met Stephanie, married and had a son, Johnny. After seven years together, they divorced and he was still reeling a year later. <br />Totally devoted to his son, he felt he would never adjust to the weekend and Wednesday night visits. He wanted to be a full-time father to his son. He was still single though Stephanie had remarried a dentist, the same one she'd had the affair with before the divorce had been final. <br />The evidence in the case initially points to Pete Braga's nurse, Sally Rainwater, though she is soon taken off the suspect list. McMichael and Rainwater get a lot closer and then, suddenly, she is again a suspect. McMichael can't decide if he feels she's innocent because it's his gut feeling or if it's because he wants her to be innocent so he can continue their relationship. <br />\\"Cold Pursuit\\" starts out slowly and builds much the way a real case would. Though it lags in places, it feels real. <br />T. Jefferson Parker brings you into the world of a homicide detective. He leaves the glitz for Hollywood and brings you an authentic case. You'll feel as though you walk beside Detective McMichael as he moves from one clue to the next, sharing each piece of information with you and daring you to solve the crime first.	2003-05-12

But it is. <br />Thirteen-year-old Jenny Weaver and sixteen-year-old Mark Patterson seem to be the center of it all. When Jenny holds a gun to Mark while, at the same time, almost begging Jeffrey to kill her instead, the first piece of the puzzle is put into place. But so many more questions are opened up by it. <br />The evidence of molestation, abuse and self-mutilation lead to a child pornography ring that seems to include more Grant County children than anyone will ever be sure of. But who is the head of it? And what can be done to stop them? <br />Suspenseful, devastating, morbidly fascinating - these are just a few of the adjectives that can be used to describe Karin Slaughter's latest release. She sucks the readers in from the very first chapter and holds their attention steady until the final page is turned. This is a difficult book to put down as each page just brings more questions that desperately need answers. <br />The subject matter may affect some readers in an adverse way, so this may not be a book for everyone. However, those who can handle its graphic nature will not be disappointed in any way. Even while Slaughter successfully holds the level of tension at a steadily rising pace, she builds the characters (secondary as well as primary) into more than just one-dimensional names on paper. There is depth to their emotions and even the abusers (in some instances) can illicit sympathy from their fellow characters and the readers alike.	2003-05-12

He titled this chapter, &quot;A Wake-up Call,&quot; but even he admits he went through long periods of doubt, denial and even self-destruction on the road to accepting Parkinson's Disease as part of his daily life. <br />Even though Fox goes into great detail about his battle with Parkinson's, he also takes you back to his childhood and all the way up to modern day.

Here's a fourteen-year-old boy suddenly orphaned, beset by demons in the night and sent to live with strangers in a creaky old mansion on the New England coast. Devon March only knows loneliness and is saddled with mysterious powers he knows little about. <br />Ravenscliff mansion, the center of gossip about supernatural happenings and Devon's new home, is set on a lofty headland on the New England coast near the town of Misery Point. <br />There is magic about this book as the author, Geoffrey Huntington, weaves a tale of gothic suspense and mystery that hooks and holds the reader for an all too short 278 pages. This is the beginning of a series of books concerning the youthful protagonist as he searches for his identity and source of his eerie and sporadic powers. <br />Written with an ear to youthful expression and social mores, it reads true to modern expression. Yet it captures the essence of classic gothic tales. <br />This is a wonderful book of magic, sorcery and mystery. A start to a series that promises to be as engaging as the Harry Potter books.	2003-05-08

But when he throws a tea cup at his boss, he has gone too far.<br />The book begins with him at Tulliallan, the Scottish Police College, where he, and several other officers who have disobeyed authority, are supposed to mend their ways. As punishment, this Wild Bunch is given an old murder case to solve. <br />But the problem is Rebus has ties to this case. And the ties may end his career permanently. Somehow he must solve the case without letting the others know about his involvement. <br />Meanwhile, his associate and friend, DS Siobhan Clarke, is investigating the death of a prominent Edinburgh art dealer who was found bludgeoned right outside his front door. Soon enough, Clarke finds that her current murder has ties to the old one Rebus is investigating and both of them are in some way related to Scottish crime lord, Morris Cafferty. <br />One of the great pleasures of reading an Ian Rankin mystery is in the gritty and realistic setting he uses for his novel. Edinburgh is so vividly depicted that it almost seems to be a character in this story. <br />Rankin is also a master at characterization and Rebus and Clarke are both fascinating individuals. The plot seems to hold less interest for Rankin and sometimes it takes several readings to figure out how he got from point A to point B. But overall this is a fine and intelligent book.	2003-05-08

The El Tovar hosted parties for the rich, famous and powerful - the perfect place for her to make enough money to take her mother somewhere far away from her father. <br />Luke Toland is the cowboy in love with Alex Keegan and it cuts him clear through to his soul when she can't see past her father's infidelities to open her heart to another. When presidential candidate Senator Winthrop of SC comes to town with his beautiful, young, flirtatious daughter who has her eyes set on Luke, Luke has a difficult time convincing Alex he has no desire to take Valerie Winthrop up on her offers. <br />To make matters worse, Rufus Keegan, Alex's father, joins the Winthrop party and she must witness his thirst for power and position no matter what the cost.

Make sure your feet are covered with thick, wool socks. You'll also have to check your preconceived notions about the world at the door and open your mind to seeing the same old things in a new way. Nikki Giovanni promotes thought. <br />In &quot;Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea,&quot; Giovanni tosses gold dust into the air and allows it to cover the world with great insights and wit. Her &quot;Poems and Not Quite Poems&quot; elicit smiles, tears and introspection. One gets the feeling of sitting at a wise grandmother's kitchen table as she cleans collard greens in a sink full of pale green water. Giovanni's words run clear. <br />She praises Richard Williams (father of Venus and Serena Williams) for committing himself to his daughters' dreams. She honors Aretha Franklin. She shakes a disgusted head at President Bush and former Vice President Al Gore. She even has a few words for Susan Smith, the woman who drowned her children in her abandoned car. <br />Giovanni speaks of her childhood and of the people who influenced her life. In this book, she sings an old, comfortable melody. <br />&quot;Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea&quot; is an interesting read. It leaps about from topic to topic like a wild rabbit exploring the countryside. Although some won't agree with all of her views, Giovanni is to be respected as a voice in our history - speaking out where others have gone mute.	2003-04-29

Ralph and Runa, the lead characters in the novel, are both in search of a new life. <br />Ralph has traveled from England to Japan in order to find a bride. He has lost the woman he brought home from Thailand and his loneliness and self-doubt lead to his wish for a new companion. <br />Because of their reputed docility and beauty, Ralph longs for another Eastern Blossom similar to his first bride. At first, his hopes are high, and he feels great affection for the women the Japanese agency introduces to him. <br />Unfortunately, the women do not feel the same affection in return, which leaves Ralph despondent. The saving grace is a picture of a woman he corresponded with in China, so he sets up a meeting with her and boards the boat that will take him to this new country. <br />Runa has ended up on the same boat, for different reasons. She began an illicit, and illegal, affair with one of her students. They are happy for many months, until someone discovers the affair and threatens to make the information known to those in the school and surrounding community. <br />In desperation, Runa devises a plan. She runs to her sister, steals her passport and heads to China. A friend of hers from school days lives there and will be able to get her a new identity. <br />On the boat from Japan to China, the characters of Ralph and Runa come together. They meet while unwittingly drawn into a fight by two other passengers, whom they end up somewhat befriending. <br />Ralph feels that Runa (using her sister's name and attempting to use her identity) could be the woman he is looking for and Runa believes that Ralph is a way out of her current situation. The reader wishes that each is the answer to the other's problems, but knows that in the end, these two characters coming together is not a good thing. <br />Susanna Jones does an excellent job in making these characters real and gets us to feel sympathy for what should be unlikable characters. <br />Despite Ralph's view of women, we want him to overcome his fears and find happiness. With Runa, we want her to realize that she is not trying to escape some unseen enemy, she is escaping herself. If only both characters could see into and beyond themselves, they would not set themselves up for the inevitable disastrous conclusion. <br />Jones is able to bring the reader into the story, and into her characters' minds, with a few well-chosen words. She weaves a spell for the reader, bringing them into the action and the story itself. Jones spent many years in Japan and now lives in Brighton.	2003-04-29

One that is shared only among the state police of Troop D. <br />It is a secret that would be unexplainable if the public were to find out about it. It's a secret about a car. <br />A Buick 8, to be precise...or so it appears at first. Years ago, the car was abandoned at a local gas station. The owner was never found. The troopers quickly learned that the Buick 8 is no ordinary car. In fact, it just might not be a car at all. <br />Young Ned Wilcox is spending a lot time with Troop D as he struggles with the recent death of his father, a state trooper who was run down by a drunk driver. Soon enough, he discovers the old Buick 8 behind the barracks in Shed B. He becomes especially fascinated when he learns his father had a special interest in it that neither he nor his mother had ever known about. <br />Each of the officers in Troop D has a part in telling the bizarre story about the Buick 8 and Ned must learn to accept their account, even if it isn't exactly what his itching ears want to hear. But the one thing that is made clear is that when the temperature goes down in the shed, a phenomenon is about to occur. <br />Moreover, when the phenomenon manifests, strange things come out of the Buick 8. Things that no one has ever seen before. Sometimes things even disappear. Like people. <br />Forget about picking up this novel with Stephen King's \\"Christine\\" in mind - and other stories like it - because \\"From A Buick 8\\" is unlike any other horror car story. <br />At first the plot may appear to be slow-moving, and just like the character Ned Wilcox, you may find yourself eagerly awaiting the punch line. But when it is finally revealed, you'll quickly realize it was worth the wait.	2003-04-29

When a series of robotic accidents occurs, struggling artificial intelligence researcher, Dr. Andrew Warne is summoned back to Utopia to dismantle his creation, Metanet, the brain which controls all of Utopia's countless robots. <br />He soon discovers that the Metanet has not been malfunctioning, but that someone tampered with it, turning the robots into lethal weapons. As the terrorists' plan unfolds, Dr. Warne becomes the one person capable of saving Utopia. <br />As in many thrillers, characterization in Utopia, is minimal. What matters most is the action of the plot. In order for the story to be interesting, it must be about characters that feel as if they are real, with all the depth and complexity of your best friend. <br />Dr. Andrew Warne is tugged in different directions as the plot demanded. For instance, the fact that terrorists are holding the park hostage is conveniently kept from Warne until after his daughter is sent out alone to play. <br />To make it more thrilling, Warne behaves irrationally, climbing through the backstage structure to pluck his daughter off the ride, even though there is no indication that this ride is going to be the target of a terrorist attack. hen the ride does suffer a terrorist attack, just as Warne finds his little girl, it is a disappointment because it feels contrived. <br />The intricate plot, though, is the focus of \\"Utopia.\\" The events of the story are told with a refreshing exuberance. This exuberant rush, however, also weakens the plot. <br />For instance, when John Doe makes his specific demands and gives his vague threats, the administration of Utopia chooses to give Mr. Doe what he wants. This is a pleasant surprise to see people behaving in what appears to be a rational fashion and not doing some sort of Rambo-esque, half-crazed cowboy stunt to defy the terrorists. <br />Still, in our post September 11th world, it is odd that there was not more outrage to express the frustration at feeling helpless and the desire to prevent the terrorists from getting their way. The characters were also constantly finding excuses to take the most outrageous actions. <br />For example, one out of shape security chief decides to climb several flights of scaffolding on a whim to check something out, instead of sending one of the subordinates. By going himself, he wasted valuable time but the plot demanded that he be the one to carry out this particular search. <br />Despite these weaknesses, the second half of the book becomes a page-turner. When John Doe raises the stakes, and the scope of his plan is revealed, tension quickly mounts. <br />However, the pacing is uneven, particularly when the ruthless John Doe decides to wait a few crucial minutes for one of his co-conspirators before making the getaway, which allows the heroes to set up one last defense. As the end comes in a rush, all the subplots are neatly wrapped up. All in all, this is a light, enjoyable novel. <br />The easiest way to describe \\"Utopia\\" is to call it \\"Die Hard\\" in a theme park. Terrorists take over Utopia, demanding a copy of the software used in creating and controlling their holograms. Dr. Andrew Warne becomes the fly in the ointment when he uncovers the depth of the terrorist activity. Lincoln Child's light thriller is a nice diversion for a rainy day.	2003-04-29

After her mother's death, Mado decides to return home to Les Salants and her father. <br />Although she doesn't expect a welcoming parade, she is disappointed to find that few islanders even recognize her and those who do mark her return with little more than acknowledgement. Her father, GrosJean, has never answered any of her letters and is unresponsive at her return.<br />In an effort to take her mind off of her own troubles and to try and become part of the community, Mado becomes involved with the dilemmas of the island and tries to lend a helping hand. However, one misstep leads to another and she finds she is making things worse for herself and those around her. <br />Only a new acquaintance, a young handyman named Flynn who has been staying on her fathers land, helps her turn the tide for herself and the island. But other forces work secretly to undermine Mado's plans and the lives of the people of Les Salant. <br />Then, just as Mado begins to feel at home once again with the island and her father, her sister and husband return with their sons to steal the attention and GrosJean's heart. A series of alliances pit neighbor against neighbor and village against village in the struggle for survival. Nothing is as it seems and no one is prepared when the truth is finally revealed. <br />Although \\"Coastliners\\" primarily revolves around Mado, a young woman who has returned to the island and village of her youth after a long absence, the story is just as much about the island and its quirky inhabitants. The reader, immersed in the dynamics of LeDevin, its culture and the idiosyncrasies of the islanders who have made it their home for generations, emerges from the tale as if from another world. A final twist at the end adds an extra element of intrigue.	2003-04-29

It was enough to move him away from climbing to a more grounded career in art procurement. <br />Years later, his comfort zone is shaken when he learns that his oldest friend and former partner, Jamie Matthewson, has fallen to his death after a dangerous solo climb. Robert veers back toward his past despite his wife's objections and heads to Wales to comfort Jamie's attractive grieving widow, Ruth. Eve Dewar awaits her husband's return and wonders how delving into the past might change him. <br />This detour places Robert in the company of Caroline, Jamie's eccentric mother, a woman for whom Robert's mother once harbored an unexplained level of disdain. Time has softened Caroline's rough edges, yet her mind is sharp. <br />Conversely, Robert's mother, Diana, sits in a retirement home with her mind slowly fading. Guy Matthewson, once married to Caroline and a pivotal part of the story, remains frozen on a mountainside so high up that he will probably never be recovered. <br />All events collide. <br />Despite the unnecessary use of the same four-letter word in varying forms by different characters, Simon Mawer has written a lovely book. The characters magically spring forth from the page and dance before the reader.

In The Kingmaker, Brian Haig's third book, circumstances affect Major Drummond in such a way that his attitude becomes occasionally more caustic than normal. <br />This time around, our beloved JAG officer is asked to defend a man accused of treason - not just any treason, however, but the worst case against the United States government to date. To make matters more difficult, treason is not the only charge against him. <br />The overzealous prosecutor has also added such things as adultery, perjury and murder. Major Drummond has a hard road ahead of him, and not just in defending someone that seems to have no possible defense, but also due to the fact that he despises his client. <br />Brigadier General William Morrison is married to the one woman Drummond has always wanted to spend his life with...the one that got away. Morrison has been a thorn in Drummond's side for years, and now he's stuck trying to prove his innocence when helping him is the last thing he truly wants to do. <br />The clouds eventually open up, though, and a ray of possibility shines through. If Drummond can find the man known as \\"The Kingmaker,\\" he can possibly find the truth behind the accusations against Morrison. With the help of his Russian-speaking, leather-wearing co-counsel, Katrina Mazorski, and the ever-present legal assistant Sergeant First Class Imelda Pepperfield, he might just be able to beat the odds. <br />Brian Haig has developed a character that is likeable and laughable at the same time that he is being brash and brilliant, which gives life to the books rather than making them just dry, legal tomes. <br />One of the best aspects of these novels is that they can each stand alone. While Sean Drummond, Imelda Pepperfield and some of the other characters surrounding his career are present in each volume, there is not a thread connecting them in such a way that the reader must follow them in order. <br />In fact, Brian Haig even takes the time to explain Drummond's \\"black unit\\" background in all three. In this way, one isn't left guessing as to how exactly he got where he was, yet he doesn't approach it in such a way that makes a Drummond \\"follower\\" feel as though it is redundant.	2003-03-04

He traveled, met famous athletes most people only dream about and was in demand. On the outside, he seemed to have the perfect life. But on the inside, he was struggling with it all and wondering if there was something more.<br />One day he sees a news clip of a professor, Morrie Schwartz, that he had during his time at Brandeis. Despite their close relationship, the two had lost touch and Mitch is saddened to discover that his lively teacher is now in the final months of his life. As a result, Mitch seeks to salvage the friendship that has been lost for decades and in doing so gains more than he could have ever hoped for. <br />For fourteen Tuesdays, Mitch flies hundreds of miles to talk to Morrie. Only, they don't just make small talk and catch up. <br />They discuss things that some people never talk about their entire lives. Death, culture, marriage, forgiveness. No topic is off limits and Morrie spouts wisdom about every subject Mitch mentions. <br />Morrie's teaching methods are somewhat unconventional as well. He teaches with love and acceptance, with openness and humor. Even on the most trying of days, when his disease is robbing him of his life, Morrie greets the day with open arms and true contentment, ready to share his wisdom with the world. <br />Tuesdays with Morrie is an unusual story that almost everyone can relate to.

In other words, a no-win situation. And Sean Drummond (along with partners Morrow and Delbert) was in charge of choosing whether there was enough evidence to proceed with a court-martial or not. <br />The case involves a group of nine Green Berets known as a Special Forces A-Team. They were in charge of training a team of Kosovar Albanians to fight the Serbian army that had driven them out of their homeland. <br />This all was to be done secretly because there was no official war which involved American forces. Basically, the Americans were to keep their hands clean while still finding ways to help the Kosovars defend themselves. <br />Seems fairly cut-and-dried...until something went horribly wrong, resulting in the massacre of the Kosovar team and a group of thirty-five Serbian soldiers. And if Drummond thought the case wasn't complicated enough to wade through as it was, he hadn't seen anything yet. Questions would multiply into more questions and the answers were pointing to more than one conspiracy . Ones larger than what Drummond could handle on his own, especially when there was a mole in his own team. <br />Brian Haig's breakthrough novel, Secret Sanction, may seem geared more toward hard-core military fiction fans at first glance, but it easily grabs the attention of a larger audience. While there are a couple occasions in which the investigating team uncovers something they find to be groundbreaking information that the average reader isn't able to pick up right away, it all opens up and becomes clear in the end. And this slight confusion only adds to the feeling of empathy toward what Drummond himself is experiencing. <br />This is a novel of intrigue, suspense, murder and large-scale conspiracy. Add all that to the adorably cynical and smart-mouthed Major Drummond andBrian Haig has a winning novel sure to earn him a large following.	2003-02-05

On the one side, they need to create new stories that keep previous readers coming back for more. On the other side, they need to write the stories in such a way that new readers will not be lost not knowing what has gone before. <br />Old readers need fresh tales and will not have the patience to sit through a rehashing of background material covered in previous books. Faye Kellerman, after writing more than a dozen books in the Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series still manages to keep that delicate balance in her latest, Stone Kiss. <br />Peter Decker is asked to return to New York to investigate the murder of Ephraim Lieber, his half-brother's brother-in-law and the disappearance of Ephraim's niece. Even before he goes, Peter questions the wisdom of getting involved in a case in now unfamiliar territory for relatives that have only recently learned of his existence. <br />Despite strong reservations, Peter and his family trek to New York to offer their condolences and assist in both finding the missing girl and the murderer. As soon as they arrive in New York, the people who asked Peter to help do everything possible to thwart his efforts. <br />If there is any flaw in this novel, it is the lack of motivation for Peter Decker. Much of the opening is spent trying to rationalize Peter's decision to take on this case. He finally flies out to New York simply because he does not want to risk damaging his fragile relationship with his biological family. However, once these same relatives become antagonistic toward Peter because of his investigation, Peter for some inexplicable reason perseveres, continuing to work the case despite the hostility he is fostering. This lack of clear, comprehensible motivation is a source of confusion. <br />Another source of confusion came with the inexplicable use of the first person when writing from one particular character's point of view. This shift in perspective brought the story to a halt until it could be determined just whose point of view was being related during the course of the narrative. Perhaps it was an attempt at artistic flair. In any event, this shift in point of view and person did not serve the story. <br />However, once past these obstacles, Stone Kiss is a tightly plotted mystery. Every peculiar detail is explained, and all the loose ends are neatly tied. It is, in fact, in the denouement that it becomes apparent just how neatly everything is resolved. It's as if the events of this story have had no lasting effect on the characters. Despite the traumatic nature of these experiences, everything goes back to normal for Peter Decker and his family. They all live happily ever after. <br />In the end, Stone Kiss is an enjoyable mystery. What it lacks in terms of complex characters, it makes up for with a complex plot.	2003-02-05

Not only had we been attacked on our soil for the first time, it also marked our entry into World War II. Somewhere a Song tells the stories of three sisters from California - Cameron, Blaire and Jackie - all in different places at the time of the attack, both spiritually and physically. <br />Jackie is a student at UCLA living at home with her parents. There had always been a hint of racial tensions between the Japanese and the whites. The Japanese seemed to stay with their own kind and as long as they didn't cause trouble, the whites tolerated them. <br />Jackie's father was no different. When Jackie met Sam Okuda, she knew he was her soul mate, no matter that his parents were both from Japan. Though different by race, they have a kindred spirit and believe God wants them together. <br />When the Japanese military attacked Pearl Harbor, Jackie and Sam were already in love, but they had been hiding their relationship from everyone, including friends and family. As racial tensions intensify after the attack, Jackie knows she and Sam will have to stand up for their relationship if it is to survive. She has seen discrimination and cruelty bestowed on the Japanese in California and she knows if she chooses to be with Sam, she must endure the same treatment. <br />Blair has a flair for the dramatics. She has dabbled at being an actress, but mostly so she can pretend to be other people and not face the reality of herself. Even when she's not playing a real role, she finds herself lapsing into whatever role suits the moment. This results in lies and deceit. <br />When she falls in love with Gary, a Christian man in the military, he is torn between his love for her and his love for God. But her lies push him away. <br />In the midst of Blair's turmoil with herself, Gary is sent to the Philippines before the US goes to war. Blair, in a most unusual decision, decides to find him there. Normally pamperedand taken care of, Blair finds herself in the Philippines trying to make it on her own and reconcile with Gary when the Japanese invade. <br />She finds Gary, but the self-centered woman in her comes forth. She wants Gary to choose between fighting in the military and taking care of her. His duty is with his country and he leaves Blair with the names of people she can call on to help her if things get as hard as he anticipates. <br />The two families he gives her are the families of preachers. The story follows Blair through the jungles of the Philippines as the Japanese move closer and closer. Not only does Blair discover an inner strength she had no idea existed; she searches for the source that strength. <br />Cameron, the oldest, is a newspaper reporter in Russia covering the war. Her father owns one of the largest publications in the states, but as an act of defiance, Cameron works for his largest competitor. Like Blaire, she, too, is in love with a Christian man. Her love is a Russian doctor, Alex. <br />Cameron wants no part of turning her life over to anybody. Her father controlled her for so many years that she can't comprehend giving up control to God. This divide ultimately separates her from Alex. <br />She forces him to choose between her and God and he chooses God. With the war going on around her and Alex gone, Cameron is forced to question her own choices in life and whether or not she is indeed strong enough on her own.<br />Three sisters in three different parts of the world search for God and for love in a very ungodly and unloving time. Judith Pella weaves the horrors of war with the beauty of God's strength throughout. God has put specific men in the women's lives to help cultivate what He knows is there.	2003-01-30

As a Mormon facing internal conflicts about his own spirituality, Daniel arrives in Jerusalem with a quest to gain a wider understanding of religion, civilization and humanitarianism. <br />Daniel contemplates the roots of the three main religions of the region - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - and how each has historically shaped culture and society, and affected individuality and group orthodoxy. <br />It is during this time that he realizes none of these religions, nor any government has managed to resolve a continuing cycle of conflict: the fight against racism, the fight for unity and the fight for diversity. <br />Seasoned with a youthful and often amusing narrative, Triopia is also an intelligent philosophical novel that offers perspective on several controversial subjects, especially the clash between individual thought and group orthodoxy. <br />Triopia and the Burden of Excess is based on the author's personal experience as a student in the Middle East. When Bryan Richards went to Israel in 1988, it was with a pro-Israel mentality, but after witnessing the age-old conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis firsthand, he came home with an understanding of both groups and the inspiration to write this thought-provoking novel.	2003-01-30

Shattered by nightmares of a caving accident that took the life of a friend, Whitney struggles for strength, and then re-enters the dark pit where she swore she would never again set foot. <br />Tom and Cricket suffer abuse at the hands of the convicts but are determined to wear their captors down in the unforgivable environment of the cave. Tom is puzzled by what might be a hidden agenda held by the prison guard who assisted in the escape and kidnapping. But before he can make any sense of it he finds himself separated from Cricket. He realizes that it will take all of his skill and knowledge of the cave to reunite with his daughter before time runs out. <br />Meanwhile, Cricket is alone with a psychopathic killer with a history of strangling his victims with his bare hands. And Whitney, with her dwindling escort of U.S. marshals is forced deeper and deeper into the cave, even as the waters from a hundred year storm rise to unprecedented levels and threaten to trap them all.	2003-01-30

Walk into the home of the wealthy Farrows family as they discover that having it all is not always a good thing, especially when you own an island deemed to be the breeding ground of all that is evil. <br />When a chemical company makes an offer to buy Calmer's Island, Ben is willing to consider selling. But after his deceased father's friend, Hanley Rivers, warns him not to sell, Ben's curiosity kicks in and he decides to visit the island that is believed to be inhabited by voodoo practitioners and even the Devil himself. <br />There it all begins. The chemical company's offer takes second place in Ben's decisions as he tries to discover and then destroy the evil that has inhabited this island for centuries. <br />Ben's wife Laura seems to have her mind on the stable hand, Bill Chambers. Julie, their daughter, is totally mesmerized by David, who also happens to be Hanley's son. Hanley seems to know more than he should about the island.

But don't let it divert your attention from this book. <br />Every character plays an important role in the way the story comes together. It is an adventure through many mysterious and exotic lands. Croydon Bates sets off to discover the secrets of his past and, along the way, discovers the secrets his family has hidden. <br />Croydon is haunted by visions of his dead mother. His great grandfather helps him understand these mysteries and helps him locate Croydon's estranged father. <br />As more characters are introduced, the narration changes points of view but the storylines continue to play off each other well like pieces of a puzzle coming together. The Cast of Characters list in the beginning of the book can come in handy when jumps in narration are made because the story flashes back from past to present so much and the characters take on new names from their reincarnations and past lives as these dimensional travels take place. <br />This novel themes around Christianity, reincarnation and the links between the teachings of Christianity and other religious beliefs. It also demonstrates how when one evil is expelled another evil will spawn in the world's cycle. Croydon tries to break the cycle and save them all from destruction and restore the world order. <br />The Other Side of the Moon is likely to break your aversion to the sci-fi genre so dip a toe into a distinctive piece of fiction with this novel.	2003-01-30

As her name implies, Narcissa is a narcissist. <br />She is so absorbed in her life and work that she pushes herself to the point of collapse. Upon waking up in a hospital, a doctor tells her that she has one week to live. As a result, Narcissa embarks on a journey to assess her life. <br />Narcissa turns her back on the film she worked so hard to bring to life. She heads to Spain simply because it is the next flight that is leaving when she arrives at the airport. A stranger in a strange land, she finds friendship, love and the strength to go on with her life. <br />Due to the highly introspective nature of this journey, a great deal of emphasis is place on the words. The words are needed to clarify pictures which, as often as not, show Narce in various states of emotional distress. As the story progresses, she shares her thoughts and memories, showing how she came to be the person she is. <br />In Narcissa, the graphics are more than illustrations that merely show a photographic representation of a given scene. Drawn in thick black lines, these spare pictures eloquently and powerfully depict how Narcissa sees her world. The occasional photographic background accents the surreal nature of Narcissa's journey into the heart of her own personal darkness. <br />In the end, Narcissa is an inspirational tale of the strength of one person as she struggles to find meaning in her life. This graphic novel is truly a work of art.	2002-12-11

Ideally, the only items that need to be &quot;told&quot; would be the dialogue between characters. The &quot;showing&quot; is done through graphics. <br />In &quot;Shutterbug Follies&quot; this advice is followed very well. The characters speak only when the pictures do not clearly show what their actions represent. The pictures decisively show characters taking action creating and solving problems. The dialogue is crisp and to the point. Dialects are handled, not with phonetic spellings, but with variations in syntax. <br />In many ways, the graphic novel shares a lot with film. Both are visual media that rely heavily on the audience knowing only what can be shown pictorially. The advantage that the graphic novel has is that one person's vision dominates the development of the story. This gives Shutterbug Follies a focus and consistency that many films lack. <br />&quot;Shutterbug Follies&quot; is the story of Bee, an eighteen year old girl, who by day works at a photo-mat deep in New York City. By night, she shares copies of the more interesting photos with her friend Lyla. When a photo of a female corpse in a bathtub catches her eye, Bee investigates further. She risks her life several times as she unravels the mystery behind the body. <br />This story is well told, with a drawing style that is simple and direct. The pacing draws the reader forward smoothly and efficiently. There are no subtle, deeper meanings in this narrative and these illustrations. <br />Jason Little's latest work, the graphic novel &quot;Shutterbug Follies,&quot; is a pleasant diversion for an afternoon.	2002-12-11

Wiprud's first (self-published) novel, Sleep With the Fishes, is a light bit of entertainment. This comic tale tells the story of Sid \\"Sleep\\" Bifulco, former mafia hit man turned informant, as he makes a new life for himself in a sleepy country town. Racing along from one improbable incident to another, this story hits its climax with a daring and dangerous stunt that should not be tried at home. <br />Sleep With The Fishes suffers from such a hectic pace. The story moves along in such a rush to get to the finish that the journey is compromised. <br />Sleep With The Fishes, as it stands now, lays down the bare bones of the story. However, it would have benefited from further revision that would put some meat on those bones and flesh out the story. <br />Further revision would have also strengthened other aspects of this novel. Only a handful of the characters are given even minimal treatment in characterization. Sid and Russ are the only two characters that have any real depth to them. <br />Certain subplots disappear without a trace. A crow named Reverend Jim stole several trinkets from Russ. Yet Jim's role in the story vanishes before page 40. <br />The use of language frequently lacks impact. Consider this line from page 84, \\"Omer dangled the receiver by a single index finger before sending it home.\\" Beyond being an awkward visual, this sentence is needlessly ornate. <br />Despite all this, Sleep With The Fishes is still an entertaining story. Though lacking in polish, the story of Sid \\"Sleep\\" Bifulco is told with a great deal of enthusiasm. Enjoy this novel for what it is worth.	2002-12-05

Some of those authors include Clive Cussler, Danielle Steel, Ed McBain, Fannie Flagg, Ray Bradbury, William F. Buckley, Jr. and more. <br />No matter what your writing experience, even if you're not a writer, you can take something away from this humorous look at the writing life. The authors lend a nice touch to the book, launching it into a writing reference tool as well as an entertaining one.	2002-11-25

Though she was raised to adhere to the strict church rules of dress and conduct, Sadie longed for the freedoms of the outside world, the world she had come to know in school. When she met a handsome, sweet-talking Englishman, she knew that she would give up everything she had ever known to be by his side and join his world forever. <br />Leah, sixteen, was the 'sensible' one. She was more sturdy than the other girls and her role in the family was to help her father. Instead of learning the womanly chores, she worked in the fields with Abram. During those long hours with her father, she learned of things the men often discussed, but she never forgot she was a woman, soon to be married and starting a family of her own. Though she longed to please her father, she couldn't marry the boy he had chosen for her for her heart belonged to another. <br />The twins, Hannah and Mary Ruth, were 10 and shared a bond only twins could share. But the girls were very different in personality. <br />Hannah was quiet, but very talented with a needle and thread. Mary Ruth was the outgoing one and intrigued with learning. Her greatest desire was to become a teacher, but she had a huge obstacle - Abram would not make the same mistake with his other girls that he made with Sadie. None of the other girls would complete school past the 8th grade. <br />Hannah knew of her sister's dream and she was determined to help. She sewed and stitched and every cent she could squander, she held in secret for Mary Ruth. Maybe one day her money would help Mary Ruth stay in school. <br />All four girls, though Amish, were anything but 'plain.' Their appearance and lives were simple, but their deepest desires are not. Their lives are intricately woven together by family, tradition and love.	2002-11-11

The spelling of common words and names are frequently changed depending on who is speaking. For instance, Garth changes to either &quot;Garv&quot; or &quot;Gawth.&quot; Even when the alterations are comprehensible, this use of dialect distracts the reader from the story. <br />What Pipsqueak lacks in finesse, it makes up for in enthusiasm. The backdrop of New York City comes across as bright and colorful. The characters are as vivid as a Saturday morning cartoon. And the plot gallops along at breakneck speed. <br />In this enthusiastic rush, there is one significant drawback. The events of this story proceed too rapidly. Before the impact of one incident can be understood, the next scene begins. This hectic pace prevents the reader from being drawn deeply into the story. <br />For a self-published novel, Pipsqueak is quite good. Despite the dialogue and pacing, this novel is readable, and holds the reader's attention. However, because of these issues with the writing, Pipsqueak falls short of the expectations of a professionally written and edited novel. Brian M. Wiprud shows a lot of promise as an up and coming author. His future books will definitely be worth looking for.	2002-11-11

The novel is divided into four parts: Alexandria, Rome, The Two Lands of Egypt and Exile. <br />An epilogue serves as a teaser for the sequel, Pharaoh, and prevents the novel from ending with Kleopatra in exile. Essex also throws in some very helpful aids for the reader: Kleopatra's genealogy tree, a glossary and a timeline of Egyptian history. <br />The novel opens with a three-year-old Kleopatra attending the death-bed of her mother. Later Kleopatra finds herself in competition with her younger siblings as her oldest half-sister Thea seduces her grieving father, Auletes, into bed and marriage in order to become Queen. By the end of Part I, eleven-year-old Kleopatra, fearing an assassination from her siblings, convinces her father to take her with him to Rome to solicit troops to help with the civil unrest in Alexandria. <br />In the next section, Part II \\"Rome,\\" Kleopatra and her father find themselves in exile when Thea seizes the throne in their absence and they are forced to remain with and rely on their Roman host, Pompey. But after a prolonged visit with no help from Pompey and political unrest within the city, Kleopatra and her father take refuge in Ephesus where Kleopatra enters into the \\"Mysteries\\" at the tender of age of thirteen, beginning her journey toward womanhood.<br />Part III \\"The Two Lands of Egypt,\\" opens with the trial of Berenike, Kleopatra's younger sister, for murder. In this chapter, Kleopatra finally meets the handsome Marcus Antony, instrumental in their return to Alexandria and the palace. A sixteen year-old Kleopatra rules the kingdom as her ailing father becomes less and less able to govern. After the secret death of her father, Kleopatra sails for Thebes to install a new sacred bull at the temple of Amon-Ra where she discovers the other half of her future kingdom. <br />More political and familial turmoil await her in the final section of the book, \\"Exile.\\" In this last part of the story Kleopatra discovers just how vulnerable she is, both politically and as a woman. After she is ousted by her child brother, she finds a close relationship with a kinsman who holds the key to her salvation and her throne. <br />In the epilogue a grown Kleopatra, now in her early twenties, finally meets Julius Caesar and sets about getting her kingdom back. <br />Finally a writer of historical fiction who is as gifted with the telling and as serious about the research as Ken Follett! Karen Essex not only breathes life into the dead legend of Kleopatra, but also into the place and time into which she was born, illuminating the major players on the world's stage.

The family - Murray, Claire, their four sons and a cat - spend the next fifteen months on the island searching for gems, but finding suspicion and death instead.  <br />The author uses an unusual device in Tourmaline. The story is told from the point of view of several major characters, including the father, Francis Cape, and the boys themselves. The most unique is the voice of the mother critiquing the words written by Oliver, the person trying to capture this story. She is the only such voice we have and it lends a feeling of authenticity to the book. <br />Unfortunately, since all the voices are filtered through the main narrator, the characters all tend to sound alike. This is a minor issue, and does not distract from the story or from the reader wanting to find out the truth about what happened on Elba. <br />Even without the essential questions resolved, the reader is left with a feeling of satisfaction at the end of the novel. We have as much of the truth as Oliver uncovered, both fact and imagination, and that is what makes the novel work.	2002-10-29

With the help of Eddie, her supervisor, and the cunning tricks of a P.I., Talba fights until the end to solve her friend's death and unravel the mystery that has gone on for decades. <br />\\"Louisiana Bigshot\\" is a lively, twisting novel that provides the reader with a look into the life of a private investigator through Talba Wallis's confident, headstrong personality.

His outlook on the situation doesn't brighten any when he finds out he's been ordered to serve as co-counsel defending an officer on charges of rape, murder and necrophilia. <br />The young Korean man who was murdered just happens to be the son of South Korea's defense minister. And to make matters worse, Drummond is on this case at the request of a former law school classmate, Katherine Carlson, a person for whom the word \\"rival\\" seemed in an inadequate term. <br />Drummond grudgingly enters into the defense, but eventually gets the feel of things and realizes their client might actually be innocent. When another of their co-counsels gets near-fatally injured and a peaceful protest turns into a massacre, he is sure there is something larger involved than just this murder case. <br />His attempts to prove this get him involved with the CIA and force him to remove himself from the defense team. The problem with that is that Katherine has no idea how to defend the client because she isn't privy to the information Drummond has. <br />Will the conspiracy be exposed, or will their client be another victimized pawn in a game more complicated than any of them realize?<br />\\"Mortal Allies\\" is the second book by author Brian Haig, both of which feature Sean Drummond. This is a character that is down-to-earth, thoroughly likeable and extremely witty. And, although he tends to make some asinine decisions, he always ends up on the right track. <br />Because the story is told in the first person, from Drummond's viewpoint, the reader is able to really get to know him...his thoughts, his attitude, the reasons behind what he does. It makes it impossible not to like and identify with him. <br />The fact that this is a book dealing with government conspiracies and the military should not be one to put off any reader that may otherwise find it not to their liking. The sharp wit andoftentimes humorous sarcasm injected through Drummond's \\"narration\\" takes this book out of its normal genre and makes it easy to enjoy by a larger audience. <br />Brian Haig knows how to balance the character's clever attitude with the gripping suspense involved in unraveling the truth behind the crime and he pulls the reader in from the first page making it nearly impossible to set the book down until the last word has been read.	2002-10-15

The people in this story ranged the full spectrum of attitudes, from the apathy of the older generation through noble ideals to the militant actions of youth. Never once does the narrative avoid the honesty of portraying the times. In the midst of all this, Easy Rawlins strives to rescue Brawly Brown from the troubles of the times. <br />While still coming to terms with the death of his best friend, Mouse, Easy Rawlins accepts a request to find Brawly Brown and help him. Easy's long time friend, John, asks him to find his girlfriend's boy, Brawly, whom John had hired on at his construction site. Since becoming involved with the Urban Revolutionary Party, Brawly had dropped out of touch with his family. His mother was scared that he might be in serious trouble. For the fee of one home cooked meal, Easy agreed to look into it. <br />Throughout the novel, black culture is presented in all its colors. Dialogue varies with the education level and social status. \\"'I'm no cop brother. I heard about this place down at Hambones. They said you guys do a lot a talkin' and I decided to come on down and hear you out.' My diction and grammar slid into the form I wanted junior to hear.\\" <br />Status is determined as much by the shade of skin color as well as well. The darker a black person's skin is, the more African he is, and the more trusted he is within the black community. Those with paler skin are shunned for betraying their race by the accident of birth. Filled with distinct characters, there is no room in \\"Bad Boy Brawly Brown\\" for stereotypes. <br />If there is any weak aspect of \\"Bad Boy Brawly Brown,\\" it is that the cast of characters is simply too large. Even though all the characters have distinct voices, many of them are not heard enough to leave a lasting impression. Beyond Easy, the most memorable character never actually appears in the course of the events of the story. <br />Raymond \\"Mouse\\" Alexendar, Easy's lethal sidekick through six previous books died three months before the events of \\"Bad Boy Brawly Brown.\\" Easy's guilt and an unreasonable glimmer of hope (since when has hope ever been a product of reason?) breathe vitality into his living memory of Mouse. At every turn, Mouse's voice whispers violent solutions to every difficult situation in which Easy becomes enmeshed. <br />Easy bounces from one situation to another as the plot meanders along. Several times the story threatens to stall as Easy talks to yet another person about Brawly's past, present and uncertain future. Many times Brawly's personal situation is less compelling than the evolution of the Urban Revolutionary Party. These glimpses of the individual emotions and actions behind the civil rights movement hold the power of living history. <br />\\"Bad Boy Brawly Brown\\" is a compelling tale more because of the insight it offers into the civil rights activities of the '60's in the Watts district than as a murder mystery. With vibrant dialogue and vivid descriptions, this episode of Easy's life is still a richly rewarding tale.	2002-10-14

The authorities are calling it an accident. <br />If that's true, then why are there suddenly people breaking into her home to rummage through Carl's office and take his files? And why does her life seem at risk? <br />The death of her husband has brought more of a change to her life than Lucy ever could have imagined. She's on the run with only the help of a former friend (ex-MSNBC reporter, Kevin) and a new acquaintance (Darcy, the woman who broke into her home). They embark upon a research expedition that will take them from one area of the country to another picking up new information along the way which points to the presence of a biological weapons program tested on American soldiers. <br />The men behind that program are extremely powerful and don't want its existence brought to light. They'll do whatever it takes to prevent it. <br />Lucy's not about to be scared off, though. Her need to know has become an obsession...one that could get her and everyone around her killed. <br />Interspersed with the words that tell the main story is the freshness of originality brought on by Siler's use of non-cliched similes and metaphors. To add to the mix, the characters have real faces made thus by just enough background information to allow the reader to empathize with them. <br />Jenny Siler's peek into the world of biotechnology is both alarming and suspenseful. Her writing suggests a knowledge that shows she must have done her own research on the subject to make the book that much more believable. <br />Most importantly, there is a much-appreciated lack of the holier-than-thou attitude that could have come across with a subject such as this. The scientific aspects are put into terms that anyone can easily pick up and understand, making \\"Shot\\" an enjoyable - rather than confusing - read.	2002-09-27

After Raiders of the Lost Ark came along, the short-lived adventure series Tales From the Gold Monkey came along. After Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings became popular, Terry Brooks' The Sword of Shannara was published. In the wake of the success of Star Wars, Star Trek was reborn as a motion picture. John Grisham single-handedly brought a revolution to the genre of legal thrillers. D.W. Buffa's The Legacy is a weak mimicry of Grisham's work. <br />Through this book, characterization is minimal and inconsistent with the way real people talk, act and feel. When a witness for the defense refuses to come to court, Joseph Antonelli is concerned that his weak case will lose the little momentum that it has. With the extra few days until the witness can appear, does Mr. Antonelli work on the case for the defense? Does he ever show the slightest concern for the innocent defendant that may be sentenced to death? No. Instead, he spends the long weekend laying around his girlfriend's house feeling cozy and domestic. The most profound characterization comes about when the characters ask themselves whether they should feel more strongly about events. <br />The Legacy depicts a portion of the unique spirit of San Francisco. At the start of the book, those who live in the area refer to San Francisco as \\"The City.\\" Such a label did not give San Francisco a feeling of homogeneity with every other city, but rather demonstrated the importance of this city to the Bay area and beyond. The bridges are the defining characteristic of the city in The Legacy. They leap across the Bay and across the Golden Gate. They are monuments greater than those who built them. <br />Other areas of \\"The City\\" though are given less attention. The characters only visit Chinatown briefly, and other than a passing remark about how Chinatown is a part of San Francisco, even though San Francisco is not a part of Chinatown, there is nothing that truly immersed readers in that area. No mention is made of the City's diverse cultural background. There was no talk of the openness that many groups found here, especially in the '60's. This version of San Francisco is quite homogenous. <br />There are two almost independent plots running through the heart of The Legacy. The primary plot is the murder of Jeremy Fullerton, the U.S. Senator. Here we have a young African American standing trial for a crime he did not commit. This potentially explosive plot line is given little attention in comparison to the secondary plot. This secondary plot delves into the corruption and greed that exemplify the common view of American politics. The nepotism, greed, and betrayals all occur far from the current events of the story and often come across as simply background material without having any dramatic impact. <br />Overall, this superficial tale is simply a light read. It lacks emotional depth and has a predictable plot. The protagonist is not profoundly changed by his experiences. In the end, Joseph Antonelli is simply a great deal wealthier, traveling in a circle of corrupt friends.	2002-09-27

As Jim Hopper of the San Diego Union-Tribune has said, &quot;At list price, it's still the best value for top-notch SF, by the page or by the pound.&quot; <br />Bear in mind, though, that when you buy in bulk, you are bound to get some gristle, fat and bone along with the red meat. Fortunately, (delicately mixing metaphors) the few bad apples do not spoil the rest of the barrel. <br />These stories cover the full spectrum of science fiction. They range from the comic to the sublime. They cover time periods from tens of millions of years ago to countless years in the future. They range from the Earth to planets orbiting distant stars. They even cross from one parallel universe to another with the greatest of ease. These thought-provoking stories stretch the imagination. <br />One selection, The Dog Said Bow, Wow, by Michael Swanwick (first appearing in Asimov's Science Fiction October/November, 2001 issue) won the 2002 Hugo Award for Best Short Story. The plot of this story is a straightforward adventure story, reminiscent of the 1971 Hugo winning novella Ill Met in Lankhmar, by Fritz Leiber. <br />Set in a distant future where dogs have been modified to gain sentience, speech and the ability to walk upright, one dog, Sir Plus and his sidekick Darger, a human, embark on a swashbuckling adventure. However, lacking the tragic overtones of Ill Met in Lankhmar, which gave that story such depth, The Dog Said Bow, Wow, is light fare in comparison. <br />In Summation: 2001, Gardner Dozois gives what amounts to a state of the union address for the science fiction publishing world. Covering everything from fanzines through the major publishing houses, this fifty-four-page summation provides more than a bare bones summary of who is still around, who has departed and who has entered the field. This summation provides a prosaic reminder of just how much science fiction is a small business. In a world of high tech wizardry, the dreamers of such technological futures rely little on rockets, lasers or robots. <br />Science fiction is kept alive through the laborious work of diligent and creative authors. At the far end of this anthology is a listing of more than 300 stories, which were given an honorable mention. With the quantity and quality of science fiction available, the genre is alive and well. <br />Overall, this is a solid collection of short fiction, regardless of genre. If a few of the stories have slow and clumsy spots, they are all readable. Surprising, even a few of the more predictable stories elicit a shiver or two by their conclusion. Pound for pound, this is a well-balanced meal filled with food for thought. <br />Gardner Dozois, editor of Asimov's Science Fiction, has again assembled a solid collection of science fiction stories for The Year's Best Science Fiction - Nineteenth Annual Collection. Among the gems here are The Chief Designer, offering a glimpse at the Soviet Union's attempts at beating the Americans to the moon; and The Real Thing, a comic story of a future where information is the ultimate resource, whether or not it is factual. Ranging from new authors to old masters, these stories represent the best of the genre. <br />Based on the past couple of decades, next year's collection is sure to fire the imaginations of countless readers and writers.	2002-09-23

His mother died when he was seven and Jackie was left in care of his addicted father. <br />Determined to leave the darkness of Harlem behind him Jackie honed his skills of comedy on classmates first and then in bars and strip joints where he meets his agent Sid. Jackie's single goal is to do the Ed Sullivan show. <br />Slowly, by polishing his stand-up routines in dives, Jackie's bookings improve until he is finally working the big clubs like the Sands and Vegas. He is rubbing elbows with the big shots and soon he becomes the opening act for Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. <br />Jackie attends parties at their houses, but ironically, he's barred from entering the casinos where he brings down the house each night. He cannot even stay in the hotels where he works the big rooms. <br />Jackie and his manager Sid must always stay in the black section of whatever town Jackie is playing. This is a frustration that becomes harder for him to bear with each rise in the ladder of success. <br />Through flashback and compelling first-person fictional narrative, Ridley cleverly weaves a tale of persistence, prejudice, blackmail, murder, bigotry and betrayal. The setting provides a social and cultural history of this country in the 1950's and 60's and reveals the motivation behind the main characters actions. <br />Each chapter is cleverly prefaced by an overview of the times in which Jackie Mann lived. \\"Too young to know about dust bowls and death camps, for kids of the 1950's there was only Davy Crockett, Captain Video, Hula Hoops and Flexible Flyers. There was only fun to be had.\\" Jackie Mann's story is an inspiring and informative look at one man's struggle to overcome forces within and without. <br />This story is a provocative look at the life and times of one black comedian as he pursues his career in the 1950's and 60's. He struggles aginst bigotry and prejudice while trying to be accepted by the white establishment. It is a story of obstacles and the courage to face them while trying to maintain a sense of self and personal identity.	2002-09-23

She wants him to meet her long lost nephew at the train station, but before he leaves, she shows him her valuable antique jewelry collection. In the center of the collection is the jewel of Madagascar - a huge, beautiful, red stone; unlike any Ricky has ever seen. <br />Mrs. McEwan encourages Ricky to take a closer look. He immediately grabs the stone with both hands instead of using the tongs on the table. <BR> <BR>At the look on Mrs. McEwan's face, he places the stone back on the cloth. Mrs. McEwan proceeds to tell him about the curse placed on the stone many years ago. <br />Whoever touches the stone, their friends will become enemies and their enemies will become friends. Ricky doesn't believe in curses, but he feels funny after touching the stone. <br />A few minutes later, Joel comes in carrying a baby crow. Not only does Joel have a knack for being unseen, he also has an uncanny ability with animals. Mrs. McEwan's five cats are at Joel's feet, eyeing the bird hungrily. <br />When Joel hands the bird to Ricky, the cats pounce. Ricky's hands are scratched and he is knocked off balance. The baby crow frantically tries to get airborne. In the struggle, Ricky bumps into the china cabinet, causing a bronze statue to hit the table and smash many of the antique jewels into small bits. <br />Ricky is devastated at the loss he has caused. Though Mrs. McEwan tells him not to worry, he feels he must pay for the damage, but he has no idea how. On the way to the train station to pick up the long lost nephew, Edward, he sees his pals, Mike and Ralphy. He tells them of his dilemma, and though they'd like to help, they don't have that much money either. <br />Once Ricky sees Edward, the supposedly long lost nephew, he knows something isn't right. He suspects this person is posing as Mrs. McEwan's nephew and is up to something. <br />Ricky makes it his mission to find out what Edward is up to. He's convinced that Edward is trying to steal from Mrs. McEwan so he sets out to prove it. <br />In the meantime, Ricky's friends are acting strangely. Mike and Ralphy seem to be doing things without him and keeping secrets from him. Ricky thinks back to the curse placed on whoever touches the jewel of Madagascar. <br />Is the curse coming true?

With beauty and brevity of language, Thien takes the reader on journeys to the inner core of her characters. <br />Each story deals with an individual's internal issues in response to an individual relationship within the family structure. Mother-daughter, father-daughter, husband-wife, and friend-friend relationships are examined in such exquisite detail that the reader will find something to draw them into the stories. <br />In each one of the seven, Thien wields her delicate power with words to paint a picture of a person trying to bring together their individuality with desire for family. She seems to have a direct connection with her characters' view of the world and of their place in it. She tells the story from one point of view, yet the reader gets a sense of how all of the characters feel about themselves as well as the other people in the story. <br />In the title piece, &quot;Simple Recipes,&quot; we meet a girl coming to grips with losing the hero worship she has always had for her father. This man is able to work wonders with rice, but cannot turn the same magic on his rebellious teenage son. A fight escalates to rage and a subsequent harsh punishment. The girl wonders how her father can have this dichotomy to him, of being so gentle with her while losing his temper with his son. <br />&quot;Four Days From Oregon&quot; examines both the marital and mother-child relationships. A restless woman runs away with her lover, three daughters in tow. The children want to return home, unsure of this new man in their lives, but their mother needs this time to make up her mind. <br />&quot;A Map of the City&quot; deals with how her relationship with her father overshadows other parts of her life. In &quot;Alchemy,&quot; a young girl tries to find a way to help her friend tell the truth and stop unwanted attention from her father. Three other equally intriguing and well-written stories round out the collection. <br />Although some of these stories have appeared in both American and Canadian magazines, this is a first book for Madeleine Thien.

Persons stick with a story because it entertains them. It is an escape from reality, a journey through someone else's life. It is adventure and mystery, joy and sorrow, the full spectrum of life brought to light. Fiction, good fiction, is fun. Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child accomplished this handily in \\"The Cabinet of Curiosities.\\" <br />For anyone interested in understanding the basic techniques of writing fiction, \\"The Cabinet of Curiosities\\" is a novel worth studying. The authors handle all the aspects of storytelling in a passable fashion. Dialogue is smooth and realistic. Characterization is believable. The plot, presented in a straightforward fashion, is handled cleanly and smoothly. <BR> <BR>Characters are the key element to creating an entertaining story. Without characters that feel as if they are alive, struggling through one conflict after another, then all the other aspects of the story fall flat. All the chase scenes, explosions and epic battles mean nothing if the characters are lifeless. <br />Fortunately, \\"The Cabinet of Curiosities\\" is populated with a cast of characters that come to life who not only act in a believable fashion, but speak with distinct, unique voices. Ranging from O'Shaughnessy, a down-on-his-luck Irish cop with a penchant for opera to the mysterious Special Agent Pendergrast, each character is memorable long after the final page is turned. <br />These characters stand out all the more because this novel is not a delightful character sketch. This book is a present-day, gothic murder mystery. It has a plot that is driven by actions. Even during the infrequent flashbacks, the characters are directly involved. The characterization comes about as an interpretation of the actions that the characters take and the words that they characters use. <br />Told from a limited third person point of view, there is rarely any confusion over who is speaking and through whose eyes a given scene is seen. Each character has their unique voice as they think and talk. These are delicate touches that are carried off in a deft manner. <br />\\"The Cabinet of Curiosities\\" is a finely crafted, gripping novel of suspense. Stretching back to the 18th century, this novel explores the darkest side of human nature.	2002-09-11

Most of Eve's life has been a roller coaster, but the one constant has been the looming gothic mansion on the hill overlooking the town, also known as Quinlin's Estate. <br />The mansion has been the silent observer that oversees the lives of the people in Lowerton. Legend has it that people who live directly in the shadow of the mansion are somehow luckier than those who lives are lived outside its shadow. But the mansion is about to fall victim to the wrecking ball and sixty years of mystery and secrets, including a death within the walls will be silenced forever. <br />Eve decides to temporarily leave graduate school and begin a quest to save the old estate. The crusade forces Eve to confront past hurts by her father, Glen Lawson. He is a man who spent his entire life searching the estate for an elusive treasure that cost him his daughter. <br />She also searches for a way to punish her father's girlfriend, Meryl, for ruining her relationship with her father. Eve's quest and the information she discovers forces her to reevaluate everything she has believed about her past and the people who shared it with her. <br />Fitting the pieces of the past into the puzzle of the present is painful and becomes even more important than the struggle to save the estate. These truths allow Eve to see the future more clearly. <br />Ghosts from the past come to life on the pages of Eve's journal. The multi-layered plot line makes the book a real page-turner. Eve's journal takes readers through the history of the estate and the people who may hold the keys to the mysteries that lie within the walls. The first-person narrative is very effective in revealing the characters and Eve's spiritual and emotional journey.	2002-09-02

No one is born with an innate command of the English language, much less with the skill of creating a novel. Masterpieces only come about after years of work, of trial, error and perhaps a success or two along the way. The Wayfarer Redemption is Sara Douglass' first published novel. <br />With this book, Sara Douglass established herself as a successful author. The Wayfarer Redemption, under its original title of Battleaxe: Book One of the Axis Trilogy, was on the short list for the Aurealis Award for best novel in Australia. (The two sequels, Enchanter and Starman, both won this award in a tie.) <br />Locus, the science fiction equivalent of Publisher's Weekly, described The Wayfarer Redemption, as a powerfully complex fantasy. Booklist describes her writing as being as good as early works by Terry Goodkind or David Eddings. <br />Despite these accolades, this book has inherent weaknesses that prevent it from capturing the imagination of readers as effectively as it could have. The characters suffer from a lack of motivation and unrealistic responses. The omniscient narrative is heavy handed. <br />Instead of showing what the characters do and allowing the readers to interpret the feelings, the narrator frequently states what the characters feel while jumping from one point of view to another. The use of The Prophecy of the Destroyer as a plot device was, at best, clumsy. <br />Sara Douglass' writing can only improve from here. As she continues to practice and hone her craft, she will undoubtedly acquire greater skill as Australia's most successful fantasy author. <br />The Wayfarer Redemption exhibits many of the weaknesses seen in writing by inexperienced authors. Despite these drawbacks, though, Sara Douglass has received wide recognition for her writing in the fantasy genre. Currently, she is finishing up &quot;Hades' Daughter, book one of The Troy Game, a series thatwill span several thousand years.	2002-09-02

There's only one way she can beat Satorno. She has to play him at his own game. <br />The only downfall to this novel is the overuse of the phrase, \\"Mental Note.\\" Character Anne Murphy has a lot of mental notes and these sidebars tend to detract from the flow of the novel. <br />Overall, \\"Courting Trouble\\" is an easy book to curl up with. Anne is an interesting character - good personality with true to life flaws. Her personal story takes interesting turns and it's a nice variation from the woman as a victim theme.	2002-08-15

Her presence is a direct result of the U.S. President's political goodwill efforts. <br />But only moments after she begins her speech, all hell descends on her and hundreds of innocent bystanders. Within minutes she finds herself in the heart of a battle zone. And just when she thinks she's being rescued, her nightmare begins. <br />Back in the United States, CIA analyst Caroline Carmichael begins her hunt for the Vice President. She suspects 30 April, a terrorist organization, is responsible. The same group who blew her fellow CIA agent/husband Eric's plane out of the sky two years before. The same group she's relentlessly researched since his death. <br />When a media tape shows up featuring the VP's kidnapping, Caroline instantly recognizes the man caught on tape: Eric. He's clearly involved in Sophie Payne's kidnapping. But just how much? <br />Just when things start to look really bad, they get worse. Mlan Krucevic and his 30 April organization take credit for the VP's kidnapping. And another tape appears. This time, 30 April insiders video Sophie at the hands of this madman. <br />Krucevic demands the U.S. President to allow terroristic actions across Central Europe in order to keep the VP alive. To ensure the U.S.'s submission, he injects Sophie with Anthrax and promises he won't issue the vaccine unless the U.S. complies. <br />The President sends Caroline, an expert analyst on Krucevic, to Berlin. What he doesn't know, what only a few upper CIA execs know, is that Eric is alive and may very well have defected. <br />Caroline's sent as a decoy, a cutout. Her mission: to draw Eric in and find her way to the U.S. Vice President. <br />The U.S. searches desperately for Sophie Payne. Caroline begins a whirlwind game of cat and mouse to lure Eric. Sophie struggles with life. And Krucevic begins his firestorm of attacks. <br />The race against time is just beginning and no one knows who will win. <br />Author Francine Mathews brings complete realism to The Cutout. She spent four years as a CIA analyst herself and incorporated her own experiences and training into her new thriller. <br />The CIA requires all of its current and former employees to submit all works of fiction for approval.

Ed McBain joins forces with his alter ego, Evan Hunter, to create this novel in two parts. <br />The story begins with Benjamin Thorpe in classic Evan Hunter prose. Ben, an architect from Los Angeles, is in New York on business. But he's no ordinary business man. He's a sex addict with a craving for young women, even prostitutes. <br />Tomorrow, he boards a plane for L.A. Tonight, he's on the prowl. <br />He begins his search for the lucky lady in the hotel bar. By the end of the evening, he finds himself at a massage parlor, not-so-effectively disguised as a brothel. The XS Salon. <br />An hour later, he's literally in a gutter. Bloodied. Badly beaten. Missing teeth. Even robbed as he's left lying in the rain. <br />The next morning, an XS Salon employee - a prostitute - is found dead, the victim of a brutal rape and strangulation. <br />That's where Ed McBain steps in. <br />Three detectives join up to solve this vicious crime. Tony Manzetti, Homicide. Jimmy Morgan, Vice. Emma Boyle, Special Victims. <br />The trail leads to a man calling himself Michael. A man soon found to be Benjamin Thorpe. <br />But as the prostitute's apartment is broken into, new questions are raised. Where's Ben? Still in New York? On the hunt for his next victim? <br />Emma puts all her efforts into this case, trying to keep her mind off her bitter divorce and custody battle. Her lone-wolf investigation reveals some shocking evidence. Evidence that leads straight to the killer. <br />Yes, it's true. Ed McBain and Evan Hunter really are the same person. Candyland being written in two parts by two very different bestselling authors is a great concept. It's not for those who can't stomach explicit literature, though. Certain parts of this novel are sexually graphic. <br />Benjamin Thorpe's outlook and behavior is absolutely repulsive. But the predicament he finds himself in, while deserving, will actually make you feel a bit sorry for him. Detective EmmaBoyle, on the other hand, is very hard to get to know. She's the type of person you couldn't get a read on in &quot;real&quot; life either. <br />All in all, Candyland's a novel with good dialogue, good narrative and even a clever book jacket picture of both Ed McBain and Evan Hunter.	2001-03-13

Tomorrow, he's heading to the state pen for seven years. <br />The 25th Hour follows Monty through his last 24 hours on the outside. He regrets his poor choices in life, questions his relationship with his girlfriend and watches his life-long obsession of being a fireman die. <br />Dwelling isn't Monty's strong suit, though. Pretty soon he's off for a night on the town with his friends. They all meet up to party now and remember the reason for the big blowout later. <br />Two of those party-goers are Monty's best friends. Frank Slattery is a bond trader. He considers the effects of suicide just minutes before he scores a two-million-dollar profit. <br />Jakob Elinsky is Monty's other best friend. He's an English teacher who finds himself fantasizing about one of his teenaged students. <br />One more night of partying. One more night with his best friends. One more night of freedom. <br />But before he boards a bus to Otisville, Monty has one final plan to execute. A plan that will shock everyone. <br />The 25th Hour is a very raw look at Monty's last taste of freedom and New York's &quot;other&quot; life - the life not advertised in tourist brochures. <br />Benioff allows us to really get deep into Monty's soul. There's a substance to Monty Brogan that makes you feel sorry for him. Yes, he was dealing drugs. But he recognizes the severity of his mistake and the great life he could have had if he hadn't taken the easy way out. <br />Be sure to turn off your sensitivity meter if you want to enjoy this book. The foul language and sexual content scratch this book from your kiddie's bedtime story list. Get past all that and the last chapter of The 25th Hour will leave you hanging on for a sequel.	2001-02-15

But an invitation to a family reunion is the last thing she expected to receive. <br />While she dismisses it as a delivery mistake, a visit from the Clements family lawyer convinces her otherwise. She packs her bags and heads to a ranch in Sedona, Arizona, to meet her potential family members. <br />The family harbors its past including the hush-hush details behind the death of Jessica's uncle and her father's former wife - the reason her father fled the beautiful land 50 years before. But as Jessica comes face-to-face with death, the secrets are forced from the family's lips. <br />While certain members of the family seek Jessica for an addition to their family tree, others seek her for hidden motives. Questions behind the deaths, selling the ranch and the disappearance of millions of dollars worth of bonds place Jessica in the center of a family firestorm. <br />Amid this torrential downpour of family scandal comes an unsuspecting love affair. But can Jessica trust him? Can she even trust her own feelings? <br />Mystery surrounds the family and Jessica's attempt to unlock the secrets could cost her her life. <br />The Perfect Family starts off a little slow, basically establishing the past and raising questions about the future. But after the first few chapters, you're so enthralled in Jessica's story that the book seems to end far too quickly. <br />The twists and turns the plot takes while revealing buried morsels from the past really does make you wonder if any family is truly perfect.
