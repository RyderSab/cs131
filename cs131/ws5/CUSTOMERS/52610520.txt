This novel is emotionally intense and made me cry, but it also drove me crazy. As others said, why would Cat put up with Travis's behavior? It is brutal and emotionally abusive (something like the behavior of the main male figure, I can't remember his name, toward the heroine in the Hawaiian volcano novel; you know the one). What I enjoyed particularly was that she didn't just fall immediately into his arms (though you know she's going to at the end), and he actually had to suffer a little for what he did to her.<br />Just out of curiosity, why is this woman bankrupting herself and ruining her health to support not only her able-bodied mother but her siblings who are in medical school? Tell them to take loans out like the other med students!	2003-12-24

As many long time fans have remarked, things have gotten a little out of hand, and no more so than in Narcissus in Chains.  I'm glad to say that they have calmed a bit in Cerulean Sins. Though there is a plot about someone murdering women, and some international terrorists drop in, the novel is primarily about many of the characters working through their neuroses. While this may be off-putting to some, I was relieved to feel at the end of the novel that some of them had actually come to terms with what they are (Anita, Asher, Richard, for example). If so, thank God! I hope in the next one we can move forward without all these hang-ups to revisit yet again...<br />That said, I am looking forward to the next Anita Blake with real hope that we are now past the intensive psychotherapy phase and back to vampire politics, vicious monster crime, and yes, lots of sex (I kind of like it, as long as it is not followed by all those neurotic regrets). And maybe Jean-Claude, Anita and Richard can come into their true power. With what seems to be on the horizon, they're going to need it.	2003-04-13

I've never been disappointed and Menage was no exception. The sex is imaginative and arousing, the characters likable, and there is enough relationship among the characters to provide a deeper level of satisfaction.  Holly's plots never involve humiliation or brutality, though there may be elements of domination at times.  She always achieves a perfect balance of these elements that make for successful erotica.	2003-02-22

Mike Muldoon may have seemed too bland to some but I thought he was absolutely charming: funny, self-effacing, loving, good-looking AND NOT ARROGANT. A very nice change. (I'd take him in a heartbeat.) Joan was a little neurotic for my taste but I liked her well enough.<br />Warning: Spoiler ahead. What I did not enjoy is this: in all three novels I have read, we end up with a long distance marriage. Does the author have trouble with closeness and intimacy? How the heck do you raise a family when the partners live on opposite sides of the country? It's all very well to have women who have important or very meaningful jobs that they don't want to leave (and, realistically, the reader is not expecting the men to leave the SEALs or whatever), but surely there has to be some other creative solution to these problems? Love by telephone with the occasional weekend in the middle of the country just doesn't do it for me.	2003-02-03

I love Jayne Ann Krentz's books, own virtually all of them (under all her names), and reread them regularly, like visiting favorite old friends. That said, I found this one just a tad disappointing. Her characters are always likeable, but I found Ethan somewhat less compelling than some of her other male protagonists, his character not so clearly written. Don't get me wrong, I want to think he's wonderful, it just didn't come across to me as clearly as some of her other characters. I wanted him to leap off the page. I was also disappointed that the relationship between Ethan and Zoe was left hanging, as it was with Lavinia and Tobias in the two Lake-March Amanda Quick books. I assume Ethan and Zoe will be back for further adventures (since this is called a Whispering Springs story, implying there will be others), so perhaps Krentz doesn't want to remove dramatic tension by solidifying their relationship too quickly, but if J.D. Robb can do it with Eve Dallas and Rourke, why can't Krentz do it with her main characters?  After all, one of the elements of fantasy in the romance genre is the satisfying feeling you get when two characters you like figure out that they are essential to one another and no one else will do. When the commitment is lukewarm (even though that happens in real life), some of the air goes out of the balloon. There are plenty of contemporary novels out there with imperfect and uncertain relationships; that's not what I read romance for.<br />I also thought the solution(s) to the murders came out of nowhere. I would have liked there to be a few more hints so that I could really go along for the ride.<br />Even a disappointing work by Krentz is better than most of the other romances or romantic suspense out there, so don't hesitate to read this one. But I will continue to look for a little more in the next book.	2003-01-15

Of course, nothing is as bad as Howard's An Independent Wife (and whose joke was that, I'd like to know?), but this falls in the same class.

Let me be the first to warn the rest of you: I don't think I have ever read a worse-written piece of prose. I can't believe it actually got printed (just goes to show we could all be published authors if this is the standard we have to meet). I did not come anywhere close to finishing the book because it was so badly written as to be intolerable. Literally every sentence has word misusage, clumsy phrasing, grammatical errors, cliched imagery, puerile ideas. It truly could serve in a writing class as an entire casebook of how not to write. There was so much misuse of even ordinary words that I wondered if perhaps the writer is not a native speaker, but I think that maligns people who learn English as a second language. Lest you think I am exaggerating, let me quote one paragraph:<br />&quot;The woman was into her early thirties, her features a sculpted mask of indifference, a facade of impartiality that made it difficult for even Mina's highly tuned senses to read anything off of. Her head was shaven near to the scalp, the slight dark fuzz across the near smooth dome providing a lush carpet and a more severe edge to her already intimidating demeanour. Her cosmetics were dark, set to heighten her uncompromising attitude, her features locked, their allure contrasted by radical intent.&quot;<br />This is virtually gibberish.  And it's all like this.  It's like hearing an orchestra playing a piece of music (the English language, in this case) with so many wrong notes that it is intolerable to listen to.  Save yourself nine bucks and find something else in &quot;adult fiction&quot; area to read. Literally everything I've read in this genre is better-written.	2002-07-24

There is not enough dramatic tension in this book, which I also found to be the case with Scott's Travels with a Whip.

I love being able to read the readers' comments to help me decide on new books.<br />I found Tongue In Cheek to be delightful. The sex keeps getting hotter and hotter; it is inventive without being brutal, and the ending is a delight.  I particularly liked the way the main female character becomes a rising star in the advertising world by incorporating her new sexual exploits into ad campaigns.  The characters too seemed like real people who developed and became more three-dimensional throughout the course of the book.<br />Erotica is rarely great literature, so we're measuring by a different yardstick than we would for Jane Austen or Henry James or even 20th century serious novelists. I've given this five stars because it is an excellent example of contemporary erotica, enjoyable to read, and even worth re-reading (something I rarely can say of other volumes in this genre).	2002-07-05

Contrary to some other reviewers, I enjoy the forensic and scientific detail. After all, that what Reichs has to offer that is special, if not unique (given how Cornwell has staked out this area for years).  However, Reichs seems to be developing a couple of habits which are getting old fast. One of them is that Tempe Brennan has a hysterical fit, in which she's really obnoxious, toward the end of each novel so far, where she does some really stupid things and endangers herself and often others. And even more annoying, in all three someone very close to her winds up in mortal danger. Please. There has to be some other kind of dramatic ending other than Will her daughter, sister, best friend, nephew die? <br />Reich's writing is improving and I am hoping that the stories will strengthen as well, so I plan to keep reading them, at least for a while.  If you enjoy a fast-paced crime novel, the Tempe Brennan series is worth following.	2002-06-23

However, I have come to appreciate that spreading her stories about multiple main characters over three books is worth it, even if you have to wait to find out how the main problem is resolved.  I agree with other readers that it was hard to get to know the characters in The Three Fates, though I felt the women were more clearly differentiated.  The men, however, all seemed like slight variations of one another. I know there is always this core of similar traits in the romantic hero, such as strength, authority, powerful sexuality, and honor. Nevertheless, the male characters do need to come in different flavors, and I know Roberts can do this, as she did with the Quinn brothers, and in the Ardmore Irish novels.  I look forward to the next trilogy.	2002-06-20

This one does not live up to that standard.  What I found most irritating about this one was that it left me thinking: Why would any woman of depth want Shane? He's good looking and rich, but where is the texture, the richness of personality?  This is a guy, who if he decides he wants to go to bed with you, lives up to his moral code of not mixing business and pleasure by firing you without notice and without regard to your skills and value in your job.<br />I'm glad I read this one out of the library.

Ritual of Proof showcases Dara Joy's usual excellent imagination, and her writing style has improved overall (or maybe she has a better editor), but if her aim was to convince us of the essential creepiness of the older, experienced man coupled with the young, innocent woman by reversing the roles, then she has succeeded brilliantly.  I started this book when it came out last year (even bought it in hardcover!) and found it so distasteful I couldn't finish it. I picked it up again this week to see if I would like it any better and had the same reaction all over again.  I'm only halfway through but I'm not sure I can finish it.  How often have we seen the romance novel convention of the older, jaded man who is so sure he knows better than the feisty but naively independent virgin who actually thinks she can live a different kind of life, only to be out-manouvered by the man who knows she has only to be awakened to her sensual nature to be content within the marriage to him?  I've never seen a book expose this plot so well for the anti-female tripe it is. If this were written as a satire it might be tolerable but it isn't, and it makes my skin crawl.

However, is there no one out who has read these who recognizes that Seth's social worker cannot begin an affair with one of the men who is petitioning for guardianship without losing her social work license, her job, and any credibility she might have in court?  This kind of behavior is grossly unethical and simply not permitted. If she wants to have a personal relationship with Cameron, she would have to remove herself from the case. And she certainly could not continue in the role of social worker, making decisions and recommendations about the boy's future, when she is for all practical purposes his step-mother.<br />The ridiculousness of this part of the story undermined for me what was otherwise a very good read.	2002-03-20

Her emotional intensity is phenomenal, particularly her ability to convey the pain of the characters when it seems like their deep and deathless love will not be returned. However, I have a quibble about one aspect of the male characters Lowell creates, which I thought was especially true of Rio. He is described a &quot;brother to the wind,&quot; which means he is fated never to settle down but instead to drift aimlessly across the West, coming and going like a shift in the weather.  Well, in psychology there is a concept called &quot;locus of control.&quot; The idea is that one has either an internal locus of control, which means you believe you are an active participant in your own destiny, or you have an external locus of control, which means you feel you are buffeted about by forces beyond your control.  An external locus of control often strikes me as rather weak: &quot;I'll never love anybody as much as I love you but I'm fated to blow away sometime; nothing I can do about it. Sorry!&quot;  Please!  A man as strong as Rio should have more strength of character. Instead of wallowing in the pain of thinking he loves her but won't be able to stay with her because of some cosmic destiny, he should put his mind to overcoming this unfortunate roll of the dice and getting on with the life he is offered (and isn't finding this woman another aspect of fate?).<br />I realize that there wouldn't be much story if this were to happen before the end of the novel, but I still found it aggravating, so much so that I skipped a few chapters and just jumped to the end, where I knew Rio would stop all this foolishness and come back where he belongs.	2002-02-26

If you've read the earlier \\"Dark\\" volumes, you pretty much know what to expect.  Francesca, the heroine, won't fall immediately into line as Gabriel's lifemate, but does so after a brief resistance.  The dialogue is adolescent, and the characters, though very old (and Gabriel is supposed to have been asleep for two hundred years) use words and phrases like \\"honey\\" and \\"You think?\\" The story is set in Paris, though there's absolutely nothing to suggest it's not in Peoria.  Even the secondary characters have names like Brice and Thompson,hardly suggestive of French.  The sexual imagery is the same, as are the descriptions.  And I'm awfully tired of his \\"large\\" everything and her \\"small\\" everything (teeth, hips, waist, hands). Are there no other images of masculinity and femininity available to us than these?  There's talk of Francesca's \\"female power\\" but it's almost never seen.<br />There's no point in reading any more of these.  The originality was played out quite a while ago.	2002-02-03

I never saw the original, but enjoyed this one very much.  The ingredients are classic Lowell: the wounded hero and heroine, each thinking they have nothing to offer anyone after having been wounded earlier in life, she by an insensitive former husband and he by that stock romance figure, the bitchy, predatory, non-maternal ex-wife. The hero, Chase, makes a monumental error in judgment about Nicole and hurts her terribly, then has to figure out how to repair the damage, hoping against hope that he hasn't lost what he didn't realize he had until it was gone.<br />This is not a novel of great sweep; it is just a simple story of misunderstanding, conflict and ultimate redemption and reconciliation, but it is a delightful read.  Lowell uses her metaphors well; the volcano, the dance, the drums, the delicate wildlife all add to the atmosphere of the place and flesh out the characters. No surprises, but well worth an afternoon or evening with a cup of tea (especially when you'd rather be where it's always 80 degrees and teeming with life).	2002-01-22

The hero is satisfyingly desperate for his recalcitrant bride, and the heroine handles his obnoxious family in a delightfully assertive and humorous way. One can see the two main characters as more similar to the Amanda Quick hero and heroine, but they are attractive and it was fun to spend an evening with them.

Many of her books of the 1980's were unbearable: domineering male and female doormat who thinks his kind of tyranny and borderline abuse is evidence of love. Then Howard really hit her stride in the 1990's (roughly) with the Mackenzie series, romantic suspense such as Shades of Twilight, Kill and Tell, and Now You See Her, and the one-of-a-kind, fabulous Son of the Morning.  Now she appears to be in something of a decline, with relatively weak romantic suspense such as Mr. Perfect and Open Season.  (Even All the Queen's Men was unsatisfying:  While I don't identify with a doormat, I find it equally hard to identify with a woman who wants to be a counterterrorism agent, living a life of deception and impermanence.) Open Season, while enjoyable because Ms. Howard is always a competent writer, lacks something.  The romance and any conflict around it is brought to a somewhat premature conclusion, and the crime is solved with a whimper, not a bang. And one of the earlier reviewers is right: What's with the murdering sidekick and the abused wife? Has he had some sort of redemption offscreen that we never saw?  Is she nuts?<br />If you're new to Linda Howard, here's my recommendation: Read every one of Howard's books from the late 80's to the late 90's; you'll find several gems. And let's hope Howard hits those kinds of peaks again in the future.	2001-10-23

She's a good writer and writes a page-turning, exciting story. However, this one seemed a little predictable, with the same basic conflict between hero and heroine being played out. Tempest insists on her independence and doesn't want to be bossed around; Darius insists on ordering her around to ensure her safety.  Since the pair are &quot;lifemates,&quot; there's no suspense about the actual relationship itself.  Also, in this one, I wish the author had settled on calling the heroine either Rusti or Tempest in the narrative (I understand that different characters called her by different names, that didn't bother me). She was Rusti in one paragraph, then Tempest, then Rusti in the next paragraph. This switching back and forth was disconcerting and broke the rhythm of the writing.  Also, the author describes Darius as having an Old World air about him, but he always called Tempest &quot;honey,&quot; which sounds so American to me.  I did enjoy the humor, something missing from the earlier novels.<br />All in all, the Dark series is always worth reading, but I'd like to see more varied conflict. I don't want to get to the point where I don't bother reading the new ones because they're always the same as the previous ones.	2001-08-14

Then they become lovers, and that's all that happens:  touching, caressing, making love, etc., while her heart is breaking because he's told her she's not good enough to be a permanent fixture in his life.  What's to love in a guy like this? And one might think a lot of sex in a romance novel is a pretty good thing, but there wasn't enough else to carry the story along and give it some varied rhythm and really engage the reader's interest.  I raced though it to get to the inevitable place where they discover that each is mistaken in the other and true love can prevail, as usual about three pages before the end of the book (I'd like them to wallow in their new communion a little more, I guess; I find some of these endings quite abrupt).  Don't these people ever have a conversation with each other?  Noble or heart-broken sacrifice without finding out if this is what the other really wants just makes me want to slap them upside the head.<br />Elizabeth Lowell, when she's really on, writes the most emotionally intense romances I know; they're truly gripping. This one had some of the intensity, yet managed to be boring at the same time.  I suggest you read some of the others and give this a miss. Or read it out of the library.	2001-05-24

A lot of people don't like Richard, and this focuses on Anita's relationship with him.  Once I got into it I really enjoyed it however. Richard is coming along as a more multidimensional character. Hamilton has really improved as a writer since the first couple of books (though I've liked all of them), and she continues to develop her characters and add new ones, so she's not just rewriting the same novel over and over. Her imagination is wonderful! She keeps adding details and dimensions to the vampires, werewolves, and other preternatural creatures in a way that's remarkably believable.  I love it that Richard is studying trolls for his master's thesis. <br />I know a lot of people have complained about Anita's sex life, but the other reviewers make it sound like it was one orgy after another, when that's hardly the truth.  And I like the way Hamilton has Anita succumb to the temptation of having two gorgeous lovers at once (be still, my heart!), only to find a way how not to wear out that plot complication too quickly.  I also like the way Jean-Claude is revealed to have more complex motives than merely to be Anita's romantic, charming lover.<br />This is a series that keeps getting better, something that you can't always say about continuing character books.  Start with Guilty Pleasures, forgive its clumsiness and wallow in its imagination, and work your way through the series. It's well worth it.	2001-03-13

The stories are fantasies or fairy tales, and they are wonderful.  The author devises weird or unusual plots and premises that are all the more sensual and sexy for being out of the ordinary (and I don't mean &quot;perverse,&quot; the way that word used to be used).  Highly recommended for its originality, beauty, and erotic charge.	2001-01-02

It was an enjoyable read, well- and intelligently written.  However, those of us old enough to be familiar with an earlier genre of book, the romantic suspense novel, will recognize the influence of, perhaps even reliance on, the novels of Mary Stewart, who wrote several excellent books, mostly in the 1950's and 1960's.  In particular, the setting in the Pyrenees harks strongly back to &quot;Thunder on the Right.&quot; Then, when the action moves to Albania, the landscape, character types, and a final plot twist (the discovery of the statues) come right out of Stewart's &quot;My Brother Michael.&quot;  I don't know if this is an homage to Stewart, but it seemed uncomfortably close to what I have to call the original.  When you're looking for something other than erotica, I strongly suggest you seek out a copy of &quot;My Brother Michael,&quot; with its powerful sense of place, beautiful descriptions, and well-drawn characters.  Meanwhile, &quot;No Lady&quot; captures a little of that, and has overt sex scenes to boot.	2000-12-12
US	52610520	RVSWCHUVB4W3A	1551660431	214191420	Full Bloom	Books	2	6	7	N	N	Clearly an early work	I agree with &quot;Reader from the Midwest&quot; that Emily is a wimpy, spineless disappointment, and Jacob is obnoxious and overbearing, like Emily's whole family.  This is clearly an early work re-issued, before Ms. Krentz hit her stride with strong, well-rounded women and men who are strong without being dictatorial, domineering, or controlling.  Don't give up on Krentz if this is the only one you've read, just stick to those written in the 1990's (or later).  I've found the re-issues of the 1980's works of popular writers such as Krentz and Linda Howard to be almost uniformly disappointing.  They often have the old romance formula of controlling, unable-to-express-love, know-it-all man and feisty (but not too much!) woman, who ultimately submits to most of his demands because he &quot;loves&quot; her.  Who needs that kind of love?  Anyway, try Jayne Ann Krentz again in her modern incarnation and don't waste money on these re-issues...	2000-12-04

I bought this the day it came out and then held onto it for a month before reading it so it wouldn't be over and gone too soon.  I thought it started out very strong, but got somewhat weaker as it progressed. The climactic scene between Roarke and his enemy lacked something, ending with a whimper, not a bang.  The evil Ricker didn't pack as much of a wallop as I would have liked. And much as I love Eve and Roarke and their relationship, I found their banter just a little too predictable this time.  <br />I always re-read books I love, but I usually set them aside for a couple of years or more, so that when I reread them, I'll have the pleasure of really rediscovering them.  With the  &quot;In Death&quot; series,  which I discovered less than a year ago, I find myself going back and rereading them already, especially my favorite, &quot;Naked in Death&quot; (the first).  It's a great series, and I love seeing a romance that doesn't end when the couple figures out they love each other, but continues with them figuring out how to live with each other, an aspect of the books which is clearly a strength.  Another strength in &quot;Judgment&quot; is that the mystery is a little more coherent and believable.  I'll definitely look eagerly forward to the next one and hope that one is definitely five-star.	2000-10-13

Two immature adolescents who like kissing and touching each other and who  tease each other like 12 year olds?  Who would be attracted to either of  these people?  Dara Joy is a fairly weak writer in the sense that her use  of language and her character development range from not very good to  terrible.  But her imagination is good and her sex scenes are terrific.   This book lacks imagination and interesting sex, so what's left? A limp,  non-mystery with obvious and predictable plot twists.  Also, I got tired of  hearing about how cute-eccentric-sexy-intelligent-nonlinear the male and  female protagonists were;  those traits should come through in the dialogue  and character development, but don't, so of course the author has to tell  us so.  <br />I suppose the references to Yaniff and Rejar mean these stories  will intersect at some point.  I'd rather leave Zanita and Tyber behind for  good after this lame effort, and see Dara Joy stick with the much more  interesting and entertaining Matrix of Destiny series.	2000-08-16
US	52610520	RQJCOJEZ2OX2V	0671034057	562966780	Now You See Her	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Lightweight but entertaining	This is not as good as some of Howard's best (like Son of the Morning), but I found the characters likeable, their romance charming. In some ways they reminded me of J.D. Robb's Eve Dallas and Rourke (though no one can  come close to those two for great romance between a tough, emotionally  skittish woman and a fabulously strong man who is determined to love her  whether she likes it or not).  I also wondered how Sweeney, after  deliberately isolating herself from relationships all of her life, could so  suddenly and without internal conflict cleave to Richard.  The murder  mystery wasn't one; the culprit was painfully obvious, and there wasn't  really any suspense about whether Sweeney would be harmed when she became a  target; Richard was too damn good at protecting her.  But overall it was a  quick and enjoyable read; if you find it in a used book store, go for it.	2000-06-09

Eve is coming along nicely in her development as a more well-rounded human being,  integrating the traumas of her past, recognizing that to love and need  someone is not a weakness.  I like her toughness, though sometimes she  seems unnecessarily rude, although she's capable of great compassion.  An  earlier reader noted that she hasn't gotten pregnant yet; much as I like  her, she's so obsessed with her job and her identity as a cop that it's  hard to imagine her as a mother. Roarke: Now there is a man to die for.   His only weakness appears to be that he loves Eve to depths we haven't  plumbed yet, which is a great thing in a romantic fantasy (which this is;  we all know there really aren't any Roarkes out there).  But it would be  nice to see a little more of his demons, and how he makes peace with them,  as we've watched Eve do the same.  Like many romantic heroes, he seems to  have no weaknesses: he understands Eve perfectly, is amazingly tolerant of  her foibles and quirks, knows exactly how to handle her (in the best sense  of that term), and defends her in exactly the right way depending on who  has injured or threatened her. Who would not like a man like this? And  gorgeous and sexually indefatigable as well! The mysteries do need a little  work.  Can there really be that many serial killers operating at breakneck  speed (murders every day, practically), even in New York?  Count up the  bodies since Eve and Roarke met less than a year ago (in Naked in Death).   The number must be staggering! I'm reading the series in order so I have  three to go.  I hope the mystery element improves, but I'm sure I'll keep  reading them anyway, since most of the fun is in watching Eve and Roarke  (and putting oneself in Eve's place).  I'm completely hooked on them.	2000-05-03

Books	2	17	19	N	N	Not One of Thirkell's Best Efforts	Angela Thirkell's Barsetshire series includes some of my favorite and most often reread books, but this is not one of them.  Many of the characters are ones who appeared in &quot;Northbridge Rectory,&quot; and the situations in this book are often rehashes of situations from that book set  several years later in time (&quot;Northbridge Rectory&quot; takes place  during World War II, and this book takes place in 1953, when preparations  are being made for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation).  The committee scenes  are copies of the working party scenes from the earlier book, and none of  the characters seems to have changed in the least in 10 years.  &quot;Northbridge Rectory&quot; is much more enjoyable.  In my opinion,  Angela Thirkell was at her best in the books written in the 1930s through  about 1946.  The later books just don't come up to that standard.	2000-04-02

Who reads bookslike this for the character development? The same ones who readPlayboy for the articles?  This is not a fairy tale; it is not a character study.

I keep criticizing them in these reviews, but I keep reading them.  I think it must be because she can be so entertaining, I keep wanting her to do  better;  like a favorite child you KNOW could bring home A's instead of B's  and C's.   Just two observations here:  Again, we have a heroine in need of  psychotherapy because she doesn't know what she really wants out of her  relationships.  She keeps on about how she doesn't want a boyfriend to mess  up her head, no relationships, thank you, all the time she's living in  Tyber's house and sleeping with him and having fantastic sex.  What is this  if not a boyfriend?  Also, isn't anyone even a little skeptical or  embarrassed about the idea of a free-lance physicist?  Believe me, these  guys can't function outside of a university laboratory with millions of  dollars of equipment (that's why we have government grants, because we  can't build particle accelerators in our basements). Well, I'll keep  cheering Dara Joy on.	1999-05-28

She writes well, her dialogue and descriptions are good, and in general the relationships are interesting.  This one however is less good than some of her other books.  It is too  long, for one thing.  It ought to have been shortened by a good 100 pages.   And I agree with other readers, the characters are less attractive than  others she's created.  If you have to choose a werewolf-themed story, go  with Prince of Shadows, or try some of her other works, such as Body and  Soul.  Still, Krinard is one of the best writers of fantasy or supernatural  romance, and it's well worth checking anything new she does.	1999-05-05
US	52610520	R1RIHBIAQD6W24	0505521784	964607725	Rejar	Books	2	5	5	N	N	The writing is appalling.	I've read three other novels by Dara Joy, and, although they are basically all the same, it's a formula I've found entertaining, and so I was glad to see that this one was being reprinted.  Unfortunately, this one highlighted the weaknesses of the others, particularly in the area of the actual  writing.  Ms. Joy is imaginative and writes great sex scenes, but her  writing is pretty poor.  There are blatant misuses of words which make it  clear she does not know what they actually mean, as well as grammatical and  syntactical errors that make one cringe.  It also makes me wonder where her  editor is;  if nothing else, the editor should have caught some of these  things.  I've read a number of romance novels and I know there are writers  out there with an excellent command of the English language, even in a  genre that gets little respect from others.  I was interested to see, in  some of the earlier reader comments, that Lilac was thought to be  particularly stupid;  this does her an injustice, since ALL of Ms. Joy's  heroines are stupid. They whine, they dither, they throw tantrums, they  overreact, and they haven't a particle of insight into their own feelings  or motivations.  Why can't she give us some women we can respect, admire,  enjoy, or identify with?  I think we deserve better, and, with a little  effort, I think Dara Joy can do better.  On the other hand, when she writes  Traed's story, I expect I'll read it.	1999-04-12

The  plot, such as it is, is a thin excuse for the sex scenes.  These are quite  good;  one would be delighted to be on the receiving end of even one of  them.  But let's face it;  these books (I've read this one and Mine to  Take) are hardly science fiction (or fantasy);  there's no effort to  develop this aspect  of the book.  The cosmic crises are gotten out of the  way in a few perfunctory sentences, while much time is devoted to the sex  and the dialogue between hero and heroine:  he makes cryptic remarks about  their destiny, she trots out a series of cliches and smart remarks instead  of actually using her intelligence to think about what's going on around  her and what her own motives are.  In addition, both of the two I have read  have exactly the same plot:  strong, sexy alien male finds the woman he is  destined for, becomes entangled in a relationship with her without her  understanding what's really going on, and spends the rest of the book  seducing her instead of talking to her (I know, I know, if he explained  there'd be no story!).  I gave this three stars because the sex was good,  and that's the biggest reason to read this, but the fiction, science or  otherwise, the plot, the characters, and the use of language was mediocre  at best.	1998-12-30

I started The  Game of Kings and abandoned it after 100 pages;  I picked it up a year  later and began again, and, once I hit my stride, could not stop until I  had read all six.  Many writers want you to believe their protagonist is of  surpassing intelligence, but one rarely believes it, because the author  doesn't have the intellectual firepower to bring it off.  Dunnett does.   The series is a joy for many reasons:  the historical accuracy, the complex  characters and plot, and, not least, the extraordinary way she brings it  all together in the last pages of the last volume.  As I look at the  comments of others, I get tired of hearing Americans whine about others  using foreign languages when they write;  it is our shortcoming that so few  of us have even a passing familiarity with other languages.  We would be  the better for a little stretching of our own intellects through a more  thorough acquaintance with other languages, history, and culture.<br />What is  it about the Scots that make them such good romantic figures, in a way that  others, the English, the French, the Italians, etc., never achieve?  All  that wild Highland blood (even in the most civilized, like Lymond) or  something else?  No matter;  you can't do any better than this series.	1998-08-24
