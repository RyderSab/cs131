Everyday after school in 1953 I went to the local drug store and looked at comic books.<br /><br />I vaguely remember the stir in the late 50's about how Comic books were bad for you ( everything was bad for you in the 50's?), but by that time they had Classic Comics besides Mad Magazine ( and Cracked).<br /><br />Reviewing this book is hard for several reasons:<br /><br />1) the presence of the Golem of Prague<br /><br />2) The open discussion ( and maybe genetic predisposition) problem of homosexuality.<br /><br />The two major characters are men who have extraordinary abilities in art and imagination. With their Jewish family background in an era when European Jews were being exterminated, it becomes it becomes a hard problem to distinguish their ordinary  life problems from what the history was shoving down their throats.<br /><br />Strange as it seems , there is a real element of the supernatural connected with this  story, both in magic and the Jewish mystical tradition, but the story is told in a very realistic non nonsense way... almost off handed way?<br /><br />What can you say about this novel? It appears to be a very honest and even realistic effort that deals with difficult themes in a nonjudgemental manner.<br /><br />It seems that Comic books have gone from the trash that kids read to becoming a<br /><br />recognized art form. This change all comes out as history in this novel as well as the change in value of the intellectual property rights in legal terms over more than 50 years.<br /><br />Before I loved science fiction , I loved comic books: I had a hard time putting this one down once I started it. It didn't leave me with a bad taste in my mouth like some modern writing does.	2005-06-09

In America after the Indian wars in the late 1800's<br /><br />Indian children were kidnapped as well. It was all done with very good intentions<br /><br /> of making good white men and women of the children<br /><br />who ended up as a new kind of indentured servant in many cases and never saw their real families again.<br /><br />I've never heard of any of the American Indians escaping and making the trip home,<br /><br />but it is known that they many of them did return to reservation life<br /><br /> and their family rather than be servants in east coast homes.<br /><br />I learned of this doing genealogy research on names related to mine by vowel changes<br /><br />(Bagola is an Indian surname).<br /><br />That three young girls made it home under such conditions<br /><br />is just amazing. For that alone the story is an epic... but they<br /><br />had \\"professional\\" trackers on their trail as if they were hardened criminals<br /><br />under a death sentence.

I interviewed Dr. Mandelbrot several years ago before a lecture of his<br />at U. C. Riverside. He is not a very friendly or communicative man. His<br />articles in general are very hard to read and without adequate history and definitions.<br />It is , thus, incredible that his original book was such a success.

Don't<br />waste your money if you don't have a graduate degree in mathematics<br /> with a specialization in noise, chaos  and dynamics.

Calling a great mathematician crazy and a speed/ drug addict isn't good. It doesn't advance mathematics.... Erdos was very nearly an Autistic Savant. His mothers love and care saved him.  A life that might have been spent in an institution became that of one of mathematic's all time greats. He wasnt perfect, but he was unparalleled in history in his in long term productivity and his teaching on the individual level.

Also to be fair he is an electrical engineer who has missed the last century of complex analysis and complex dynamics completely. It would make a good introduction for a college course on the complex plane. The history and proofs are well worth the price as they can't be found together in other books. But a book on imaginary numbers that omits Klein groups, Julia sets and Mandelbrot can't be said to be fair or modern. If he is sending his engineering students into the world thinking that complex analysis ended in 1899, he is doing them a real disservice and preregistering them for failure in a world where chaos and aerodynamics depend on nonlinear equations on the complex plane.	2001-12-04

In Britain Gamov wasn't popular. Now days Hawking doesn't even mention Guth's name in his lectures on his new Instanton universe. The idea of false vacuum, negative pressure and exponential inflation have never been popular, but even Hawking can't make the big bang work without an inflationary period. Guth dumbed this book down so that there are no equations. I suppose we could go to his original articles to see them, but we bought the book so we wouldn't have to do college library crawling and xeroxing. So as much as the author is and does give in this book, it is still a failure. Don't buy it: find a book which also offers you a chance to see it is all smoke and mirrors where gravity and charge hadn't been formed; where a universe of between .5 grams and 25 grams became<br />all we can see today and more.

I got Sawyer's book used in a book store and for 15 years I have used it's wisdom in my work on non Euclidean geometry, fractals and group theory. I just got &quot; Elliptic Curves&quot; by  Mc Kean and Moll. For once a Cambridge book that doesn't eat dust! It is so hard to read papers by Yau that one gives up! Most Modern mathematics is written by people who can't communicate...  Sawyer is a guide for writers of mathematics... how to do it well!	2001-07-28

This classic little book sits along side of Sawyer's &quot; Prelude to Mathematics&quot; as the go to books for basic understanding. To these books I have added an unlikely candidate &quot; Elliptical Curves&quot; by McKean and Moll.  If one has these three books, he will have a crack in the dam  of mathematics...	2001-07-28

For me with a library and long history of reading topology books, it is understandable. The author is recognized as a great mathematician, but I think he should have had his maiden aunt read his proofs for the book... he writes badly of topology and his references aren't anywhere near clear enough. I suppose it is that I found that his treatment of the tetrahedron and projective plane  really don't work well when translated to numbers....	2001-07-28

He had trouble with reading it. It is only for that reason I give it only 4 stars. These authors make others that I have read on this range of subjects look bad: Fields Medalists included! A lot of it is that they just bother to give you the real mathematics with examples. I think the initial miss definition of the Riemann surface gives a false impression, because the explanations of ramified covers and toral elliptic lattices is just wonderful. Reading this book makes Dr. Singerman's  papers look so much better! I was disappointed in the treatment of triangle groups, but the treatment of modular functions and gamma1 and gamma2 makes up for that. It is a masterful work... the best I have seen by a modern author.  It reminds me of books by Ulam or Russell. Sawyer's little book is not as good!	2001-07-28

He used to write a &quot;crafted&quot; novel that was well researched and had suspense. At least he hasn't stooped to using sex! Op Center  is slow and plodding and actually pretty dull for a bloody thriller. Net Force has all too much blood and gore to be actually about the web!  The techno window dressing was put in to &quot;sell, sell, sell&quot;. He has become a &quot;product&quot; and his books are no longer literature, but formulas for the best seller list?	2001-01-27

If you want to understand Wiles's use of modular forms in his proof of Fermat's last theorm, it isn't  advanced enough! It also isn't an easy read, but it tries to cover the  major areas. It is best in quadratic number theory and worst in Dirchlet  L-series and Gaussian Sums, but it mentions just about every area of number  theory. If you want &quot;easy&quot; as well as cheap, look elsewhere.	2000-08-29

I wouldn't tell a first time student to read it, but it is written so that if you have a background in topology, you can follow things like Holder's inequality. It has a useful section on convergence topology that applies to much of the applications of modern topology. I frankly wish I hadn't spent the money on it!	2000-04-07

This book is very technical in the mathematics of shift operators: even with a good understanding of Hilbert spaces and Banach theory this book will  be very hard to read. If you are a PH.

I have found the information and references in this book to be very good. In most cases Ivars Peterson is one of the best new science and mathematics writers that  I know of! I'm interested in chaos and fractals, but mathematics also is in  this book. There seems to be a little of everything. There is even work by  Mandelbrot that I hadn't read about. I can only fault that he didn't put in  enough of the equations and code to produce the examples. Also a glossary  of terms would be helpful. But it is a very good buy in paperback!	1999-12-16

In a world where fractals and their functional analysis are everywhere, Banach spaces are necessary. Several years ago I reinvented  Banach space in my ignorance while studying fractal theory. A book that is  both cheap and gives a running shot at learning about this complex graduate  level subject is important! I won't say this is an easy book, but for the  price it is well worth it as a doorway to a new world of analytical  function theory.	1999-12-08
US	50840646	RW3G6XNXQKQWL	0387979425	503490691	Complex Dynamics (Universitext)	Books	4	5	55	N	Y	My letter to Dr. Pickover about this book:	I got the Complex Dynamics book that Dr. McMullen recommended and I linked last to Amazon.com : there is no mention of programming anywhere in the book! It is Ivory tower math that enshrines the \\" Julia set\\" as  perfect mathematics, ha, ha... Since I have used IFS to simulate Julia sets  experimentally, I can say that I have a hard time recognizing it in their  language!  Something is dreadfully wrong in this axiomatic approach that  ignores the actual math that is calculated and it's methods! The thesis on  Herman's rings by the Dane is as good a complex dynamics text as this one  and he actually defines terms like quasicomformal in Riemannian terms so  that it can be understood! There is a real need for better bridging books  between graduate level axiomatic approaches and beginning complex variables  and programming! It should probably not be written by a professor type who  will be forced to bend to \\" peers\\" in his use of language.  Definition of terms and glossaries are so sadly missing in so many of these  books!<br /><br />I amend this review years later. I've been using this book as a reference and studying it.<br />I stand by the first review as it was a disappointment when I bought it, but after years<br />I found that it is better than other books that I can find on the subject<br />( specifically: [[ASIN:3642088066 Computability of Julia Sets (Algorithms and Computation in Mathematics)]]).<br />Professors in this area of computer mathematics are told not to include<br />programs for some reason: it is the kiss of death to the book!<br />You can only compute these sets with a computer program of some sort,<br />so that a book that leaves out the programs leaves out much of the subject.<br />I've been doing this for more than 20 years and still much the professors say is worthless<br />in actual practice.	1999-12-08
