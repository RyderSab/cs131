As such, I'm posting two reviews combined here that I did of the electronic versions of these two stories.<br /><br />Courtesy of Love Romances<br /><br />PERFUMED HEAT<br /><br />Artemis Gray is a renowned maker of men's cologne. He's hoping to expand his business into the women's cologne market by partnering with another well known perfume maker. When he arrives at an extravagant dinner affair with his two children in tow, hoping to make the connections necessary to gain the additional business, he never expects to make a connection of the heart.<br /><br />Moira Archer is the assistant to the owner of James Parfumes. When she attends the dinner with Sylvia James, who is hoping to land Artemis into bed as well as her business, Moira isn't expecting the shock of meeting him in the flesh. She is immediately attracted to him, first by the scent of his seductive cologne, then by the man himself.<br /><br />Artemis never expected to find a new mate. He is a werewolf, one of a species who mate for life. He expected to spend the rest of his life alone after his beloved Myste died. His attraction to Moira immediately consumes him, making him long for nothing but to possess her. Can he convince her they are meant to be? What will she do when she discovers his secret?<br /><br />Artemis is a hero to die for, totally alpha male who will stand for nothing and no one coming between him and his chosen mate. He's been at a loss since his first mate died and never thought he'd find someone who could make him feel that way again. So he's quite surprised that after so many years he is incredibly attracted to Moira. That passion drives him to make her his own.<br /><br />Moira has never been so passionate about someone as she is upon her very first meeting of Artemis. This shocking desire she feels drives her to act in a way she'd never believed herself capable of doing. She's more then enough of a match for him, even though she tries to deny this relationship they've found together. Moira is fiery in temper and personality, with an insatiable appetite for sex. She's just what Artemis needs, if only she can allow herself to believe it.<br /><br />One very disappointing thing was the absolutely dreadful editing. There were words missing, misused or misplaced and grammatical errors. If one can ignore bad editing and it doesn't distract from the story, then it won't be a problem here. This reviewer however, was repeatedly pulled out of the story as a result.<br /><br />Perfumed Heat by Judy Mays is a short, hot, seductive tale that will leave readers breathless for more. The sex scenes are varied and intense as would be expected of a species known for their animalistic tendencies. Keep an ice cold glass of water nearby as one will certainly need to cool off after reading this story.<br /><br />**Note: it is possible that an incorrect, pre-final edit copy of the book was sent to the reviewer, even so long after the release date. But as it can not be determined with absolute certainty, the reviewer opted to leave in the editing comments as a precaution to future purchasers... just in case.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, August 2005. All rights reserved.<br /><br />IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT<br /><br />Serena Wilde is in a bind. She is a werewolf just coming into her annual wolf heat phase. She desperately needs to get away from her sanctuary, the wolf preserve run by Dr. Kearnan Gray where she has lived and worked for three years. No human man can satisfy her sexual urges during her wolf heat and she can't let her boss know of her true identity. If he knew what she was, he'd hate her for it, and she'd need to find a new place to hide from the domineering leader of her pack, who has decided he wants Serena no matter what.<br /><br />Kearnan created the preserve as a way to escape his ancestry. He must keep his true identity secret for if Serena knew the truth about him she'd run, just like she did from her own pack. He senses she is his one true mate, but unfortunately for him, she is unaware of this fact. He knows that the only way into her heart is to capture her and forcefully show her that this is her destiny. What will happen though when her pack catches up to them and his true identity is revealed?<br /><br />For fans of strong paranormal erotica with some D/s bondage scenes, this story will entice. Domination and submission is the way of life in a wolf pack, since as people know, wolves are led by the strongest, most dominant alpha wolf and his chosen mate. That aspect of pack life is covered in spades in In the Heat of the Night. Serena is absolutely furious to find she has been imprisoned by Kearnan, vowing revenge at any cost. However, her tune changes dramatically when he proves that he alone can sate her sexual hunger in the strongest days of her heat cycle. She comes to love his domination over her, even revel in it. The sex scenes between them are explosive, causing readers to sit up and take notice, and maybe even start looking for their own significant others.<br /><br />Kearnan is a tortured male, feeling that his family line makes him a lesser being then others of the werewolf community. While at first readers will not understand his feelings, they come to understand him when his genealogy is revealed. Serena is somewhat harder to relate to, however. Her reason for fleeing her pack - to escape the alpha, Alex Whitehorse, who wants her as mate - doesn't completely gel with her behavior with Kearnan. Her biggest complaint is the fact she does not love Alex. While the fact she does not love him is completely understandable since wolves (and werewolves) mate for life so therefore she would not submit to him. Yet with Kearnan, she falls under his spell immediately and is eager for attentions though she hates him for imprisoning her.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the editing in this book is terrible. There are misused words, misplaced words, and just plain old bad grammar. Punctuation is incorrect or missing altogether. The poor editing in parts can cause readers to be pulled out of the story. One can only hope that editing will improve in future books by the publisher.<br /><br />Readers of the first book in the series, Perfumed Heat, will enjoy the opportunity to visit with some of the characters, even for as short a time as they are in this story. The secondary characters each have their own stories as well, and will leave one eager for more background on them. One character that stands out is George Two Bears, who is the most mysterious of all characters in the book, and evidently has quite a history of his own.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />This story starts almost a year after Book 5 ends, with Rayford Steele contemplating the state of the world since the Rapture. He's filled with rage at the fate they've been dealt and wishes he could be the one to destroy Carpathia. Hattie has gone missing, in her own desperate desire to kill Nicolae, and the Trib Force worries she may have unknowingly compromised their safe house. At the same time, believers are preparing their underground network for the day that all are forced to take the Mark of the Beast to buy or sell anything.<br /><br />This story keeps you guessing as to what will happen to Nicolae and will the Two Witnesses at the wailing wall in Jerusalem finally meet their foretold end. Many different members of the Trib Force wish Nicolae would die and hope they will be the one chosen to see out the prophecy. The book steamrolls through the end, with us meeting new people, and saying good bye to others, good and evil alike. The book ends with a cliff hanger as to what really happened and \\"whodunit.\\"	2005-09-14

This book picks up where book 4 left off, with preparation for the meeting of the witnesses in Jerusalem. Nicolae tries to prevent the meeting then tries to take it over when stopping it isn't possible. God's judgments grow fiercer when after the meeting, the first of the Angel Trumpet Woes hits, with all non-believers being attacked by hideous creatures led by the demon Apollyon. Hattie is more an more torn over the pending birth of hers and Nicolae's babies.<br /><br />There is more action in this installment, with all the action surrounding the Meeting. the description of the meeting is vivid and very realistic for an event of such magnitude. The demon locusts unleashed are suitably hideous and the suffering of victims is intense in its occurrence.	2005-09-14

This story picks up just after the \\"Wrath of the Lamb,\\" the great earthquake affecting the entire world. Our heroes Buck and Rayford, on opposite sides of the ocean, search for their loved ones, praying to find them alive. In the aftermath of the quake, the battle lines between good and evil are more clearly defined as people become more in awe of Nicolae or more clearly sworn to their divine beliefs in God.<br /><br />Slower going then some of the previous installments, this story will still engage readers, just not quite to the extent of preceding works. There is still plenty of action here, with Nicolae's attempts to thwart the efforts of the Tribulation Force, and the desperate searches occurring around the globe of survivors for their families and friends.	2005-09-14

They now live in North Carolina, having crossed oceans to live a happy life together in young America. Their daughter Brianna and her family, husband Roger, and son Jemmy settle in with the Frasers to share a new life and new adventures. Yet unrest is breaking out in the colonies, unhappy with how England is running things. Jamie is given the job of building an infantry militia to prepare for an outbreak of war.<br /><br />I could not get in to this book for anything. With all of the past Outlander books, I have been sucked in from page one and couldn't stand to have to take any sorts of breaks from reading. Not so with this one. I was bored senseless and kept trying to come up with excuses to put off reading the book.<br /><br />Normally I love how the author teaches us along with entertaining us. I've always wondered how people made do in past centuries with amenities we've become used to like toothpaste and toilet paper. There were loads of these bits of trivia throughout which I enjoyed. However, the plot moved so slowly I kept thinking \\"get on with it already!\\" and \\"when will it be over?\\"<br /><br />There wasn't enough action here, not like in previous books in the series. To me, this story was all about showing off impressive research, and not enough about the characters' stories. It could have done without a few hundred pages and still gotten the story across without dragging on so long. Was there a reason we were given the lecture on genetics twice, in almost the exact same wording? Details like this had a lot to do with the less than exciting segments of this story, which were too frequent to be enjoyable.	2005-09-14

However, this one has to be kept secret, as it is to be a private wedding. Her two best friends have found their Prince Charmings. Parker Dillon, princess of Eliason is returning home to be wed. Shey Carlson is coming also, to marry her very own Prince Tanner, Parker's former betrothed. Now only Cara remains to find love... or does she?<br /><br />Three months ago on a magical night back home in Erie, PA, Cara met a stranger with whom she had an immediate connection. One night of passion has resulted in a pregnancy. Believing her lover had abandoned her after a one-night stand, she is resigned to being a single mother... until she steps off the plane in Eliason and sees him.<br /><br />Prince Michael Dillonetti, Parker's brother, had gone to the US to bring his sister home. While there, he met a woman and it was love at first sight. He never knew her name but has been searching for her ever since. He's stunned to find his mystery woman is one of Parker's best friends. He's even more shocked to learn she's carrying his child. He vows not to let her get away again, but can he convince her he loves her and that the only answer for him is \\"happy ever after?\\"<br /><br />As with any book by Holly Jacobs, readers will find engaging characters that are so real one would expect to see them in town. Cara is a kind woman who is very soft spoken and would do anything for her friends. In fact, she'll help out anyone she feels is in need. Her every thought is for everyone but herself and she always willingly takes a back seat to others. When she meets Michael, AKA Mike King, she finally finds something she would go after no matter what, until the morning he disappears on her, and she believes she was nothing but a fling for him, that is. Discovering she is pregnant with his child, the unborn baby becomes the most important thing in her life.<br /><br />Michael fell for Cara the moment he first saw her and all he wants is her, not even knowing her name. The night they were together meant the world to him and he was crushed the next morning when he came back and she was long gone. He knows she's the only one for him and just needs to find her again. When he discovers her identity, and her secret about being pregnant, he realizes he has to convince her to stay. The effort he puts in to proving he loves her is evident to everyone but her. How these two bridge the gap between their different lives is enough to warm anyone's heart.<br /><br />Readers will delight in seeing that even though this story doesn't take place in Erie, many of our beloved friends from Perry Square put in an appearance. There are even some who star in their own sideline story in this book. Of course, no Perry Square book would be complete without Pearly Gates and her stories. Have no fear, she is here and so are her zany tales. She is probably one of this reviewer's favorite secondary characters of any books she has read, by any author.<br /><br />Sit back, relax, and get lost in this charming tale, for it is certainly a winner.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

Abby's special ability is her link to the sea and all the aquatic beings, especially a bond with dolphins with whom she works. One night while swimming with her dolphin friends, she is the sole witness to a murder near the shoreline. Now, her life is in danger and she is led right back to the man she wishes she could forget.<br /><br />Alexsandr Volstov is an Interpol agent investigating possible Russian mob activities in coastal California. He never expects this investigation to drop in to his arms the one woman he's ever loved. When he discovers Abby saw the murder of his partner, he knows the danger she now faces. Who better to protect her then himself? Especially if it gives him the excuse to stay close and try to win back her love.<br /><br />Now Alexsandr and Abby must work together to solve the mysteries surrounding them. However, she is still  emotionally hurt because of something he did to her several years before. Can they overcome the past that is separating them?<br /><br />This story is typical of Christine Feehan's writing. The hero is a total alpha male who will let nothing get in the way of getting what he wants, especially if that something is the woman he's deemed as his own. The heroine as ever, is resistant to his domineering ways, resenting him for the power he holds over her, but giving in to him all the same. The only thing about this book that is different from the Dark series is that the hero is not a Carpathian. If not for that, and Abby's abilities, this story would be completely interchangeable with any book in that series.<br /><br />Abigail Drake is an interesting character, with her magical abilities being quite intriguing. She has a special affinity for controlling the water and all found within. She also has the extremely useful ability of being able to make people tell the truth. The magical talents of the sisters are always the highlight in this series. However, Abby is afraid to use her powers as a result of the incident involving Alexsandr many years ago that forced her to pull away from him. Her relationship with her sisters is far more interesting than what she shares with him though. This reviewer could not stand Alexsandr at all. He is too overbearing; too \\"me Tarzan you Jane\\" for this reader. At several points throughout the story, one will want to slap him for being so pushy, and slap Abby for falling under his spell yet again. Readers will love the mysterious Russian hit man though, who is incredibly powerful with magic himself and will want to know more about him.<br /><br />The plot was well done in the beginning, but it became convoluted in the middle of the book. There was too much going on that was just coincidentally linked to everything else. If the plot had been limited somewhat, focusing on one or two of the key elements rather than having so many sub-plots, it would have read much smoother. There were a few things however that made this reviewer sit back and say \\"Huh?\\" For example, what's up with the red panty ceremony anyhow? Here we have a heroine who is quite insistent she wants nothing to do with the hero but she willingly puts on a pair of red panties that have been blessed through a ceremony meant for the sole purpose of making the wearer want to fall immediately into bed with her man. This was just too absolutely ridiculous and took away from the story.<br /><br />This reviewer was relatively unimpressed with Oceans of Fire. Fans of Christine Feehan who love the typical alpha males who all look and act the same will enjoy this one though, if for nothing else but its similarity to all the books in the Dark series. If looking for a unique story that is nothing like anything else on the market then one ought to pass on this book.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, August 2005.

He's a member of US Special Forces and has been deep undercover for several months. He's about due for leave  when he finds out the woman he'd been writing letters to... the woman he loves... has married his brother. When a new mission comes up for a solo operation into Mexico to rescue a kidnapped doctor, he jumps on it.<br /><br />Dr. Jane Harker is deep in the heart of Mexico, practicing medicine in one of the poverty stricken towns. She couldn't be happier with her life until the day a big burly man claiming to be there to rescue her, sneaks in to her bedroom and saves her just as someone tries to murder her.<br /><br />Now they must journey across Mexico, on to Washington, DC and finally to the Luchetti Farm in Illinois. As they try to get to the bottom of the mystery and keep Jane alive, neither counted on the all-engrossing love that would spring up between them, changing them forever.<br /><br />The mystery weaving through the story will keep one guessing through the end. There are enough twists to the plot that when the mystery is solved, the reader will be surprised at who is guilty. It's obvious the author did her homework when researching how the military works, especially Special Forces. A Soldier's Quest is packed with action/adventure, suspense and romance.<br /><br />Bobby is nursing his broken heart when he meets Jane, therefore the attraction between them shocks him. Jane was happy, in spite of her overbearing mother, a US Senator, and perfectly content to live in the middle of Mexico giving medical aid. She has no plans to do anything differently, until Bobby saunters in to her life. The love that develops between them changes their lives forever.<br /><br />This reviewer has been eagerly awaiting Bobby's story and was more than pleased by A Soldier's Quest. Readers have learned so much about Bobby from his family in previous books that they already feel like they know him. When he is finally reunited with his family, the emotions overflow from the pages and right in to the hearts of the readers. Fans of this series will love the opportunity to visit with the large Luchetti family once again, but will be sad at the same time, as they realize there is only one more story left to tell, that of Dean, oldest of the brothers.<br /><br />If one is looking for a full rich story, with lovable characters and a swift moving plot, this latest one the Luchetti Brothers saga will satisfy.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

All he cares about is enjoying the pleasures of the flesh and adding to his collection of erotic art. Until he grants the death bed wish of his uncle to right an old wrong, that is. Now Ewan is off to Scotland to grant this request and his life changes abruptly as a result.<br /><br />Bride Cameron is the sole support of her family that consists of herself and three younger sisters. They make their living by doing engravings using their father's old equipment, and by a secret mission that could get them into big trouble if ever discovered. The last thing she needs is an overbearing man coming into their home with the strange idea that he should support them.<br /><br />Sparks fly between Ewan and Bride from their first meeting, and those sparks grow into a burning desire as they journey back to London to try and track down the person who is forging money and priceless works of art. As Bride works her way in to Ewan's heart, he begins to wonder if his life would be better with her in his bed... as his wife.<br /><br />Madeline Hunter has written another lush historical to delight her many fans. In this story she even gets to demonstrate her remarkable knowledge of art, which is the focal point of her career outside of her books. It is more than evident that she knows her stuff where the history of the art of printing is concerned. Readers will love to see the results of the compilation of both of her careers in this book.<br /><br />Readers who have read previous books in the Seducer series will remember the carefree Ewan. It is delightful to see how he grows and changes throughout this story. Bride is a force to be reckoned with as well, with a fiery temperament to match her flame-colored hair. Ewan has met his match in Bride and watching the dance of desire between them is fascinating.<br /><br />The plot of the forged art and money is brilliantly woven throughout the story, adding to the romance found in this tale and showcasing both Ewan and Bride's considerable knowledge of art. There are also enough sub plots to intrigue readers on many different levels. Readers will also relish the opportunity to visit some old friends from previous books in the series.<br /><br />As always, Ms. Hunter has penned a passionate love story, rich in historical detail, that is bound to leave fans, be they new or old, longing for the next book by this talented author.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

His one throwback to frivolity was to buy a lottery ticket every week. He always swore if he should ever be lucky enough to win the lottery, he'd take his winnings and use them to make the world a better place for others. He never expected that he would one day actually get just that chance.<br /><br />Dorian Burrell is the sole heiress to one of the largest oil corporations in Texas. She has always had everything she ever desired, with plenty of money to always get what she wanted. When her Grandmother cuts her off for three months to teach Dorian a lesson, she has to rely on her wits and the minimal talents she has to get buy.<br /><br />When her financial planner offers her a way out, as a tutor to Briny, who wishes to refine his image and personality, so as to do the most with his newfound wealth, she scorns him, but realizes that is her only option at present. So Dorian grudgingly takes him under her wing, training him in the ways of the rich and famous. However, there was one thing she never counted on, that she would fall in love with the ruggedly handsome cowboy, finding she was longing for something she could never have.<br /><br />This is a sweet romance, with a nice change on the traditional Cinderella story. Briny is a good-hearted man, who only wants to help others and make society the best he can. Dorian is a spoiled little rich girl, though under that fa'ade, she is very insecure, feeling she is undeserving of anyone's love and respect. Briny sees what she hides from everyone else, and makes it one of his goals to prove she is deserving of his love.<br /><br />Briny is the type of man every woman dreams of finding.

Roland of Gilead is passing through a strange town where he is attacked by slow mutants. He is nursed back to health by sisters he presumes to be of the \\"Jesus-man Religion.\\" Shortly after arriving, he begins to suspect they have ulterior motives for his person, but are waiting impatiently to reveal the deadly secret.<br /><br />This story is classic Roland. He is on his long journey, runs into trouble and needs aid to escape. The young woman who aids him puts her own life at risk and he must escape the town with guns a-blazing. Short and enjoyable, Dark Tower fans will love this addition to the series.<br /><br />Since I had just finished the entire saga back to back on CD last year, I was glad to get another chance to have a brief visit with one of my all time favorite characters from any book I have ever read.<br /><br />Majipoor - Seventh Shrine by Robert Silverberg<br /><br />This story was harder to follow and I had to listen to it more then once to get even a basic understanding of the story. Unfortunately I think I still missed the deeper meaning of the story.<br /><br />This is about the discovery of an ancient shrine in the desert, with the archeologist who found it being subsequently murdered. There are many mysteries surrounding the shrine, endangering the lives of anyone who tries to open it.<br /><br />Having not read any other books by this author, this story is extremely difficult to get into. I was confused throughout the whole thing trying to figure out what was happening. Those who have read other books in the Majipoor series are bound to enjoy this one though.	2005-09-01

When she gets to the home of James McCairn, she finds that he may be the one man who can make her change her mind about never falling in love or marrying.<br /><br />This is classic Deveraux, if not as superb as earlier works. Temperance is a fiercely independent woman who chafes at the confines put on her life by her mother's new husband. James is the proud Highland clan chief who takes his role seriously, in spite of the barely making ends meet state of his clan lands. This two are perfect for each other if only they can see that for themsleves.<br /><br />James has a tender side, that is evidenced in the relationship he has with the villagers of his land, especially the children.

Part of her quest involves coming to terms with the love she had for her former flame, Jordan Hawke, best selling author. As they join forces to solve the riddle and defeat the evil Kane, their love grows strong once again, just in time to try to save Dana's life, and the souls of the Daughters of Glass.<br /><br />This was not a bad story but this trilogy seems to be dragged out a bit much. The focus of this story is on Dana and Jordan, but too much time in spent exploring the beginning love between Zoë and Brad. Nora Roberts should make sure she remembers the focus of the story and doesn't risk having another, secondary relationship steal the show.<br /><br />I do love the concept of the Celtic Goddesses imrisoned and that only three humans can free them. The magical bend to this story will certainly appeal to fans of the paranormal romance genre. Without the Goddesses and their long suffering guardians Rowena and Pit, there would be no story.	2005-09-01

She ends up at a station house until she can heal and bumps in to the man who ran her off the path, and ends up falling for him in the end.<br /><br />I was bored with this one. I'm sure there was supposed to be more to this story then I got but it just wasn't appealing enough to keep my interest. I liked the touch of romance found in this story, and the concept of how news gets around in this world is enjoyable, but other then that, this story left something to be desired.<br /><br />The Wood Boy by Raymond E Feist: I already forget most of this story. A compound is attacked and everyone slain but the young wood boy and a young girl with whom he is friends. The girl was taken by the murderer and the wood boy goes to rescue her, only to have disastous results.<br /><br />This book was not appealing to me and I didn't get anything out of it, hence why I already forget most of it, even having just \\"read\\" it a week ago. I suppose it could have been a good story as it started out interesting, and the series it stems from may be a good one, but I'm not going to try any more of them just now.<br /><br />The Hedge Knight by George R R Martin<br /><br />A young squire is knighted just before his master knight dies. Dunk, the former squire, goes off to compete in a tourney. Along the way, he takes on a young orphaned boy as his squire who is not at all what he seems. All comes out in the open when Dunk the knight defends a young woman against one of the cruel princes and he finds he must face the consequences of what happened.<br /><br />This was the most interesting of the three stories in this volume. I'm actually interested in this one and following along quite nicely, not getting distracted in the middle of it. I love the idea of medieval knghts standing up for honor and support of those in need. It must be the romantic in me who enjoys this sort of thing.his sort of thing.	2005-09-01

While on the expedition with guide Ace Montgomery, her client is murdered and she and Ace are blamed. Now Fiona and Ace must try and track down the real killer, and find the answers to the mystery, in their dash through FL and the Everglades.<br /><br />Perhaps it is because I could only get the abridged version of this book on audio, but High Tide didn't grab me like Deveraux's books usually do. I loved Ace, after all those Montgomery men are to die for. Fiona on the other hand I was unimpressed with. Her entire life is Kimberly, who readers are supposed to be kept guessing as to who exactly she was, though it was pretty obvious to this reader.<br /><br />The mystery plot line is quite intriguing however and will keep one guessing as to why Ace and Fiona were chosen for this trip and why they were targeted set up for the murder.<br /><br />Sparks fly between Ace and Fiona, though at first they seem to despise each other. Extreme circumstances can affect anyone though and these two find out just how attracted they are to each other, and discover they may very well be perfect together.	2005-09-01

She had just left her future husband at the altar She realized she did not, and never would, love him. All her life, Charlie had done everything she could think of to please her mother and make her proud. No matter what she tried, she always fell short of what her mother desired.<br /><br />Dan Martin is the owner of Imperial Shipping. He is heading out for a delivery run and finds the runaway bride, complete in gown and veil, running down the street, the entire wedding party hot on her sneaker-clad heels. Dan plays hero and picks Charlie up and takes her with him.<br /><br />Now Charlie is on her own with no money, or job, or even a place to live... but she is free!

He is a loner, convinced he is meant to stay that way his whole life, after having spent his entire childhood being passed from one foster home to the next. So no one is more surprised than he is when he offers Charlie a job at Imperial, and a place to stay, until she gets back on her feet.<br /><br />Charlie tries to get her life back on track, while dodging her overbearing mother and her obnoxious ex-fianc&eacute;. She also finds herself falling for her personal knight in shining armor. However, Dan is resistant, thinking she is merely on the rebound and that she will move on like most everyone else in his life had. Charlie knows what she is feeling is real, but will she convince Dan of that before he pushes her away forever?<br /><br />Ms. Fuhrmann has written a good one here, full of her trademark humor. The electricity between Charlie and Dan is evident on every page and the reader will delight in following their exploits and missteps in the relationship dance. One can't help but love them both and cheer them on to a happy ever after. This reviewer liked the use of fairy tale euphemisms that are found throughout the story and woven into the theme.<br /><br />Charlie's mother Harriet and ex-fianc&eacute; Winslow are a riot convinced Charlie is not serious and trying to force her to go along with their plans. Her relationship with both of them is very frustrating and the reader can't help but feel what she is, and applaud her decisions.

And since the links are messed up, I can't load a review of Legends Volume 3 where it belongs, WITH Volume 3. So I'm going to review that at the bottom of this one. So this review is actually for parts 2 AND 3 of the Legends anthology.<br /><br />Legends Volume 2--<br />New Spring by Robert Jordan<br /><br />This was very hard to follow for new readers of the Wheel of Time series.<br /><br />The gist seems to be that a great hero/leader, The Dragon, has been reborn and there are many who want to find him for different reasons. The evil Black Aja sisters want to destroy him and are going around murdering anyone young man they think may be the dragon. The rest of the Aja, and their allies, are looking for him to protect him and aid him in learning his abilities.<br /><br />At least I think that is what it was about, and I listened more then once. I did grasp the idea of the Dragon and I understood there are different sects of the Aja, defined by their color. What the difference between them is I have no idea. I can only assume that is explained in the full length novels in the series.<br /><br />The Sea and Little Fishes by Terry Pratchett<br /><br />It is the time for the annual town fair, of which the favorite event is the witch competition. Granny Weatherwax has always one and this year people don't want her to participate. At the same time, Granny decides to go on a \\"friendly\\" binge, at the advice of her friend Nanny Og. But her attempts to be friendly backfire when everyone assumes she's only doing that to try and cause trouble.<br /><br />I liked this story, even not having read anything else by this author. I especially loved Granny, in spite of her gruff and less then friendly attitude. She rang true to me, probably because everyone can think of at least one grumpy elderly person they know. Even though she is not the nicest of people, readers know there is more to her then meets the eye or else Nanny would not be friends with her.<br /><br />The Grinning Man by Orson Scott Card<br /><br />Alvin Maker and his young companion are passing through when they come across a young man, Davey Crockett grinning down a grizzly bear. it turns out the bear wins the match and that means Crockett becomes his \\"pet.\\" So they travel around and bump in to Alvin again in a small village with a crook for a miller.<br /><br />This story was somewhat corny, but amusing. Alvin seems like an intriguing fellow and will make readers want to know more about him, possibly reading other books in the series by this author. I especially liked the entirely different perspective given in to the person of Davy Crockett, and loved the idea of his relationship to the bear.<br /><br />Legends Volume 3--<br />Debt of Bones by Terry Goodkind<br /><br />A young woman goes to the high wizard of her land in order to seek his aid in rescuing her family from the rival land. She calls the wizard on a \\"Debt of Bones\\" between her mother and his father when he refuses, only to find that after he grudgingly agrees, this debt is not what she expected at all.<br /><br />Interesting story that I enjoyed and was fairly easy to follow. There are a couple twists in the story to shock readers. I enjoyed visiting this world and would not be opposed to a future visit.<br /><br />Dragonfly by Ursula K Le Guin<br /><br />A young girl who desires to be trained in the ways of the wizards heads off on a journey with a former student of the wizards, in the hopes she can convince the wizards to break with tradition of only teaching boys, so she can learn magic. When she gets there, nothing goes as she hoped and she discovers a shocking secret about her lineage.<br /><br />Not a bad story but confusing in many parts. Also, this author desperately needs a better editor as she's extremely repetitive and has a tendency to overuse words and phrases to the point it gets very annoying. It also gives a good glimpse in to the \\"politics\\" of the Earthsea world and how women are valued and thought of there.<br /><br />The Burning Man by Tad Williams<br /><br />To be honest I had no clue what this story was about. Something about a man who appears in fire but I couldn't even quite figure out why he appeared. I tried listening to this story a couple times and could not get in to it at all and had no clue what was happening. I finally gave up.<br /><br />I tried to listen to this one three times and could not grasp it at all. this could be due to the fact I like to listen to books when driving so occasionally I miss things, but with almoste very other book I've \\"read\\" this way, I always come away with far more understanding of what happened and why then I did of this story.<br /><br />If readers have not tried Tad Williams' works before, this is not the story with which to start. However, those who have read other books set in this world will likely understand and follow it much better then newcomers would.there.

Courtesy of Love Romances Reviews<br /><br />Wow!!! Michelle Pillow puts a whole new spin on the legend of the vampires with this, the first book in her Tribes of the Vampire series. This book will keep readers engrossed from beginning all the way to the shocking twist of a climax at the end.<br /><br />Hathor Vinceti has come to London to help her beloved Aunt Georgia run her bed and breakfast inn. One evening while trying to find a restaurant her aunt recommended, she gets lost and finds herself in a place she never imagined to exist. What she discovers is a dark underworld society where vampires rule and don't care who gets in the way of their fun.<br /><br />Servaes is a 17th century French Marquis turned vampire who has grown weary of his long non-life and is only going through the motions to please others and keep the unruly young vampires in line. When he sees Hathor in the crowd at London's vampire club one night, he is immediately drawn to her for some unexplained reason. Something about her is different and though he can't understand it, he senses she may be very important to him.<br /><br />Servaes and Hathor are drawn to each other from the first moment they see each other, but all is not easy in their love. The young vampires are jealous of their happiness, and will destroy it at all costs, and the Tribal Council, thought to be a myth by most vampires, is not happy about Hathor's introduction to their world. Can their love survive the dangers they face, and can Hathor truly accept Servaes for who, or what, he is?<br /><br />This story is absolutely fascinating! It follows a slow but steady pace throughout much of the book, but there is plenty of action and intrigue, and of course romance, to keep readers captivated. Though Servaes and Hathor's story follows through to a more then satisfying ending, there are enough mysteries left in the story that are sure to be addressed again in future books in the planned series. Also, the stunning climax will leave readers gasping for breath at the totally unexpected turn of events. Though surprising, it will make readers shout with joy, and make them realize that was the only way this story COULD end.<br /><br />The relationships between all the characters are well done and beautifully portrayed, especially the romance of Hathor and Servaes. All of the fears, frustration, tenderness, and love between them can be felt very strongly by the reader. One will also feel the hate and fear of the lesser vampires, the courage and underlying strength of the more powerful ones, such as Jiri, and the familial love between Georgia and Hathor. One will be hoping throughout, that the lovers find the happiness they both long for.<br /><br />This is probably one of the best books this reviewer has read this year, and is one of those rare books she feels is totally deserving of the best rating possible to give. There was nothing disappointing about this book, except for some editing errors scattered throughout. Although the unresolved mystery subplots may leave fans wondering, this doesn't detract from the story. It's evident that these mysteries will be carried on into future books, where this world will be delved into with more detail. Well worth the time and money, don't wait! Run on over to NCP and pick this one up today! It is guaranteed not to disappoint.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, September 2004.

When her father turns up dead, she runs to escape the brutal man, Dougal, who intends her to compel her into marrying him, so he can stake his claim as the clan chief. As hounds are chasing her down, she runs right into the arms of another, possibly even more dangerous man.<br /><br />Symon MacLachlan, known by all as the Devil of Kilmartin, suffers from his own personal demons, being dragged down into the depths of madness. When a mysterious beauty crashes into him in the circle of stones, where his curse first manifested itself, for an all-too brief moment his agony is assuaged by her touch. He rescues her from her pursuer, and takes her with him back to his keep, convinced she is the infamous Lamont healer, though she denies this at every turn.<br /><br />Elena is even more afraid of Symon and his madness then she is of Dougal, but she has no choice other than to go with him for now, and plan to escape as soon as she is able. All her life, people have used her for her gift and she believes Symon intends the same, especially with all his demands that she heal him. She continues to deny the truth, holding back her abilities and posing as a simple herb woman who has some training in healing. Symon knows she can help him and decides the only thing to do is to woo her into assisting him. The last thing either of them expects is the tender feelings that spring up between them, making Elena wish she could stay with him, in the only place she ever truly felt she belonged. Symon finds himself wanting more then just her aid... he wants her heart as well.<br /><br />But Dougal is still on the loose, and has vowed to get Elena back at any cost. He swears he will conquer the MacLachlan clan, once and for all, and snatch back his intended bride, the only person standing in the way of his full rise to power. Elena and Symon have no choice but to trust each other if they are to defeat Dougal finally, but can they do that without risking her secret getting out and his madness overtaking him completely?<br /><br />What an incredible read! Ms. Wittig has shown her very impressive talent in this, her debut novel. The passion between Elena and Symon erupts from the page, making it impossible for one to doubt their feelings for each other, even while they continue to deny it to themselves. All of her characters are full of life and vigor, from Auld Morag to the clan's children. Dougal is evil and vindictive, bringing out chills for the readers as they wonder what he will do next.<br /><br />This story has a little bit of everything in it. There is a touch of the paranormal in Elena's healing gift, suspense in the drama between Dougal and the MacLachlans, and mystery in Symon's madness and its origins. One can also find humor and some good family feeling as well. The mystery was well done, even keeping this reviewer guessing to then end, rather then figuring it out immediately, as is the norm. A couple interesting twists at the end of the tale make for a pleasurable read.<br /><br />If Devil of Kilmartin is any indication, then Ms. Wittig has a jump-start into what is sure to be a phenomenal career.

Or because her fianc&eacute; decided they needed to take a break from each other and postpone the wedding, after all, he can't, as a brilliant doctor, have any negative publicity besmirching his name. Or her family falling apart all around her. No.. It couldn't be any of that, could it?<br /><br />Simon Masterson has dedicated all of his time in the past few years, even at the sacrifice of his personal life, to building his company, SimonSays, which develops telephone answering systems. He is presently putting the finishing touches on what was his best system yet, Cindy, guaranteed to make telephone mazes simpler and easier to navigate. The last thing he needs is some uptight female ruining things for him with her study that is all made up of lies. When he shows up on her doorstep demanding a retraction of the story, things just go from bad to worse.<br /><br />When Ari and Simon meet at her door, sparks fly and tempers flare... Until they realize they may be the solution to each other's problems. Simon convinces Ari to do another study, this time on Cindy, and maybe find out if that wasn't just the best one out there. In trade, he will help her out with her family crisis, stepping in to assist in cleaning up the mess. Meanwhile, they will both be free to explore their mutual attraction to each other, with no strings, and even a \\"done-deal\\" set date. But neither counted on the fact that what they thought was their worst nightmare, may actually be a dream come true.<br /><br />The story is full of wit and humor, with an unusual subject for the plotline, in this, Ms. Jacobs' first Flipside book. Comedy at its best, there are always the requisite scenes for making a reader laugh out loud over the vivid images created. Most certainly too, this reviewer will never look at a game of Monopoly in quite the same way again. Why? Well read the book and understand. The details of Ari and Simon's \\"deal\\" are amusing; in some of the ways it can be mutually beneficial to them both.<br /><br />As always, Ms. Jacobs, a talented romantic comedy writer, delivers a pleasing tale. Her sense of humor prevails, making for a book that is chock-full of hilarity. One would have never imagined telephone answering systems, complete with mechanical voices and bad muzak, could be funny. Nor could it have been dreamed that they could have such a long range of reaction attached to them.<br /><br />All of the characters are enchanting, as is a trademark of the author. Who would have thought two such different people as Ari and Simon would come together? They are more then a match for each other in fire and attitude. The secondary characters always add a new element, from Ari's irrepressible mother to her walker-brandishing grandmother, Bubbi. And one can't forget Simon's indomitable office assistant, Celia, among others. What an eclectic bunch of personalities here!<br /><br />Ms. Jacobs' book is well worth picking up for some light reading, or for the next time the reader is stuck in a dead-end telephone maze.

As with the two preceding titles in the series, each story revolves around the same element, in this case, stone.<br /><br />In The Shattered Stone by Rosemary Laurey, Alys is left alone after both her parents die from the gray plague. Forced out of the only home she has ever known, Alys sets off on a westward journey to find the home of her mother's people. Along the way, Ranald ven Strad, serving the monarch by hunting down a long lost relative, comes to her aid. Little did either of them know that The Shattered Stone pendant Alys carries is the answer both of them are seeking.<br /><br />The Shattered Stone is a wonderful quest story. Alys has nothing left of her life except the few hidden items of her mother's she found. All she wants is to grieve for her parents but circumstances won't allow for that. She shows strength and grit in her decision to venture out alone, against the odds. Ranald is a man on a mission who never lets personal feelings get in his way. Yet something about the innocent Alys reaches out to him and makes him want more for the first time in his life. Seeing these two find peace and happiness together makes for a passionate love story. I do think Ranald was a little bit too oblivious to who Alys really was but I guess that had to be the case to allow the story to progress to the requisite Happy-ever-after.<br /><br />Halfling Li is exiled from her home and her people when she reveals she would be happier living amongst the humans than with the elves who have never treated her well. Now working at Graystone House, her job is to take care of the Evil Ones - hundreds of stone gargoyles, rumored to be cursed, that make her nervous. When she accidentally releases Nikolaz \\"Nik\\" of Riverhaven from his stone prison, Li finds out that the best things in life come After the Rain.<br /><br />In After the Rain, we find a little bit of everything that makes fantast romance so popular. Here we have witches and curses, gargoyles and elves, and a love that transcends them all. Li was heartbroken over her family's betrayal yet still believes someday she'll meet the right one to love her. When she accidentally releases Nik, he does not trust Li, convinced she is the witch who cursed him and takes her captive. As their travels continue on the way back to Riverhaven, Nik and Li slowly come to trust each other, and that leads to a passion they've only dreamed about. They rain too is an important player in this story. Every single traumatic event in Li's young life has occurred during a storm so it is fitting the way the story concludes.<br /><br />I've loved each book in the Paradox series and Paradox III is everything I expected. Keep in mind however, that while this book is classified as an erotica, it is not nearly as spicy as you'd think. There are only a few passionate encounters to each story. The sexual tension between the couples is what up the ante here, adding to pleasure to be found in the reading. I am still hopeful that eventually we'll see more stories in this wonderful Paradox series.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, June 2009. All rights reserved.makes fantast romance so popular.

Book 4	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Fans of Ms. Fuhrmann's fairy godmother series will be more then satisfied with this story.	Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />Fans of Ms. Fuhrmann's fairy godmother series will be more then satisfied with this, the conclusion to the story.<br /><br />Fern, Myrtle, and Blossom have been fairy godmothers forever, their most recent successes being with the Aaronson family of Erie, PA. When they are condemned to life as humans, with none of their powers to help, things get very interesting for them. Though their methods have always been unorthodox, they've never failed one of their charges. Now they are the charges, and they are in for a surprise. The grandmotherly personas they've adopted to make their jobs easier have also been stripped away, and the three are in their true forms, drop dead gorgeous women!<br /><br />The next six months proves to be an eye-opening experience for all of them. They each find new things to do that they enjoy, as individuals rather then a team. Their new lives also bring them the one thing they've never had, their own special kind of love with wonderful men to bring them the happy-ever-afters always granted to others. But what will Blossom, Fern, and Myrtle choose when their time is up? Will they continue to live in this world with the men they love, or will they go back to Fairyland and the lives they've always known?<br /><br />As always, Ms. Fuhrmann charms her readers with a delightful story, full of her trademark wit and humor. Each of the three sisters are unique individuals and the paths they choose to take, as well as the men they come to love reflect that. What is interesting to this reviewer, is that there almost seems to be a change in the three, as to which of them is the strongest. The one who always came across as the least strong, the least independent before shows her true colors in this book and lets everyone see just of what she really is made.<br /><br />The three stories in this book totally intertwine, as well as keeping their uniqueness, through to the end of the book. The men they fall for are perfect complements to them, and there is even a cute surprise at the end. Anyone who has read the first three books in this series will love how those characters come back to visit in this book. Whether new fans of the series or old ones, this story is guaranteed to please one and all. Be sure to get a copy today and see how the indomitable fairy godmothers three get the happiness they've long deserved.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, April 2004.

Her gift is in her voice - the ability to soothe the souls of people in distress with only her words. She has returned to her home town, just in time to celebrate Christmas, and enjoy the annual Christmas pageant, with her family and friends. Little does she know what fate has in store for her this holiday season.<br /><br />Matt Granite is a retired Army Ranger who has recently returned home to take part in the family business. He has loved Kate for years, but figured she was too \\"perfect\\" to ever be interested in a man like him, especially since he had a tendency to act clumsy in her presence, much to the amusement of his brothers. When Kate asks him to do some work for her in a run-down mill she intends to turn into a bookstore, he jumps at the chance to spend more time with her. What he doesn't know is she has always felt the same way for him.<br /><br />While they are inspecting the building, they find an old crypt in the basement, which seems to have been opened by a recent earthquake, allowing something better kept imprisoned to escape. Suddenly Kate feels that an old evil has been freed, something dreadful with plans to ruin Christmas. Its first desire seems to be to destroy Kate, and her family. Matt wants nothing more then to protect his love from the entity set on destruction. Now all seven sisters must join their powers to stop this being once and for all, before it destroys Christmas, her town and family, and her new-found love.<br /><br />Is there nothing the incomparable Ms. Feehan can't write? Once again she has proven herself a master of the paranormal romance genre. She is always pushing the envelope with new stories bound to become keepers for all of her fans, as well as to bring in new ones. Her voice is as fresh as ever, proving her imagination is far from tapped out. This book is very different from most of her other works, while still showing strong her trademark voice.<br /><br />Matt and Kate are meant to be together, if only they can get past their doubts. Sparks are evident from their first meeting in the story, igniting rapidly into the 5-alarm blaze their passion develops into. Both are amazed by this, never having believed anything could come of their love for each other. Plenty of humor still can be found, even in the midst of such a dark tale. It is provided by the antics of Mike's brothers, and a couple of Kate's sisters, as they harass the couple, and other family friends. There is also evidence of a couple blossoming relationships between some of the other characters, possibly to be developed in future books in the series.<br /><br />The action is well-developed and perfectly paced to keep the reader waiting with baited breath. The anticipation builds, with Kate and her sisters' victory becomes more imperative as the malevolent entity grows in strength, all the while wearing their own strengths down.

Courtesy of Love Romances Reviews<br /><br />The story of the Coven of the Wolf continues in this, the second tale.<br /><br />It was Summer Solstice and Brenna Lindsay was paying homage to the Goddess when everything she knew changed. There was a murder in the forest adjacent to her land and she sensed the terrible evil behind it, threatening the peace of her town.<br /><br />Ty Buchanan is sheriff in town and is investigating the murder. When he meets Brenna, the attraction is immediate and intense. He doesn't understand this sudden passion; he only knows that she will be his.<br /><br />As Ty and Brenna partner up to solve the murder case, and the overabundance of dark magick in their town, their ardor consumes them both. They are destined to be together, Goddess has seen to it. As the evil grows the closer they get to the heart of it, they must rely on their love for one another, Ty's dormant magick, and all of Brenna's skill with Moon Magick, to win the battle once and for all.<br /><br />Here is a story full of passion, suspense, magick, and underlying strength of character. The plot flows seamlessly from beginning to end, snaring the reader in its spell. This story expands on the world introduced in Destiny's Magick, yet is able to stand on its own. Here too, Ms. Morgan continues her trend for portraying strong heroines to save the day.<br /><br />Brenna is a great woman, full of power and courage. Ty is the ultimate alpha male, bound to protect his woman at any cost, even when he is the one needing saving. They are perfect together, each strong where the other is weak. It was also enjoyable to have a chance to visit once more with some beloved characters from the previous story. Boris and Igor, the twin Russian shape shifters are back, playing a key role in this story, and adding some lively moments. It was fun to see Igor's antics, especially as he fancies himself in love with Brenna, and desires her for himself. Drake and Rhea, the powerful coven leaders, even have a cameo, much to the delight of readers. Add in a suitably evil villain, a bevy of bad guys (and gals), several coven members, and Brenna's beloved pet wolf, Star, and fans have a delightful cast of characters to round out the plot.<br /><br />This reviewer is one fan who is eagerly awaiting Ms. Morgan's next chapter in the story of the Coven of the Wolf.

This story packs a punch! If readers want an incredible werewolf story with a twist, then this book is one that must be read.<br /><br />Officer Jessie McQuade has seen much in her job as a policewoman, but strange things have been happening in Miniwa, Wisconsin lately. The normally subdued wolves in the area are striking out, attacking humans for no apparent reason. As she investigates deeper, more and more leads don't tie up, and many doubts surface. Everything comes back to the huge, lone black wolf she keeps seeing everywhere. So her practical nature causes her to turn to a professor for help.<br /><br />Will Cadotte is an expert in Native American mythology and the logical person for Officer McQuade to turn to when an animal totem charm is found. He has a lot of answers, but even more questions are raised as he helps in her investigation. The things he talks about are unbelievable to Jessie, things that just cannot be. And what's the matter with her? She's inexplicably drawn to this enigmatic man, and he makes her toes curl in the most delightful of ways.<br /><br />As things grow stranger and the time for the full moon, a rare Blue Moon, draws near, danger is more imminent and Jessie doesn't know what to believe. All of the evidence is pointing to something she can't even begin to comprehend or accept. Is it really something supernatural and therefore beyond her control? And what about Will, is he friend or foe, incredible lover or deadly enemy, man or man-wolf? Want to know the answers, then drop everything and read this book!<br /><br />Welcome back to the paranormal genre, Ms. Handeland! This story is one of the best this reviewer has read in quite a while. The plot leaps and bounds forward, like the running wolves, but is not in the slightest bit confusing or disturbing. One will become entrenched in the story from the very first line, and want to keep reading uninterrupted through the end. The Native American mythological spin on the legend of the werewolves adds depth to the story, making it all the more intriguing for the tantalizing glimpses into those beliefs.<br /><br />Jessie is a great character, full of sass and with a delightful, sarcastic sense of humor. One will laugh out loud many times as a result of her unexpected witticisms. Will is a hero to drive women crazy, tall dark, handsome, and yes he's got a brilliant mind to go with it! Who wouldn't fall for a guy like that? Jessie didn't stand a chance. Add in the very elderly police dispatcher, Zee, with the mouth of a sailor, who loves her job and loves Jessie like a daughter, a very frightening wolf hunter who may be more then he seems, and a score of townspeople, and this story has incredible life built in to it.<br /><br />This story is absolutely incredible and the only bad thing about it? That it can't go on forever! Have no fear readers, there are already at least two more books in the works to extend this foray into the otherworldly.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />Ever wondered what really goes on in the dark underworld of some of the most infamous cities in the US? Well, this tale will tell you one interesting perspective.<br /><br />Cyra Delphin is special... so special in fact, she has never really felt like she belonged in society. She was a selkie, one of the water people, whose family had always denied her abilities and traits unique to her kind. Nonetheless, she had made some place for herself in the world, and if she wasn't happy, she was, at least content. Until the day her world fell apart.... Forcing her to flee for her safety into the deserts of Nevada, the last place a selkie should be.<br /><br />Thomas Marrowbone also was special, being fey himself, but he was not just any fey. He was a very unique one, with amazing abilities that he kept under tight rein for fear of what he'd do with them. He was also on the run, trying to keep alive while he completed his mission. He had to infiltrate the Goblin hive in Las Vegas, destroying their Queen and her lair, before her heinous plot could be completed, wiping out the entire state of California.<br /><br />When these two meet up in the desert, Thomas is in sad shape and sorely in need Cyra's help. These two discover that if there is to be any hope for the human race, and the magical one as well, they must work together to destroy their enemies. Along the way, they find passion and adventure and that all is not what it appears to be. Will they defeat the evil Goblin Queen Lilith and her minions? Will their courage and strength be enough? Will they overcome the hurdles in their way to find the love they are destined for? Only one way to find out... Enter the Goblin lair... if you dare.<br /><br />Ms. Jackson shows once again that her talent for writing incredible tales and making them believable is far from exhausted. She, as always, is challenging the boundaries of romantic fiction, creating new worlds and genres with her novels. Whoever would have imagined Goblins would play such a large role in romance? Strange, yes, but it sure works here. The story is captivating, from the first line to the last. It is full of dips and rises, one adventure ebbing seamlessly into the next, until the heart-stopping climax, which will surprise the reader.<br /><br />Thomas and Cyra are memorable characters, believable and full of life. Their attraction is immediately obvious, and when they come together, the pages of the book spontaneously combust, singeing the fingers of the reader. They are two of a kind, lost in a society that would deny their very existence if it could. Lilith is grotesquely evil, making one despise her completely for what she is. Also, fans will be happy to see some characters for the previous book in the Wildside Romance series, Traveler, make cameo appearances to aid our heroes.<br /><br />What a delight this book is! While this book is first and foremost a romance, enough other details are woven in, so that it continues to explore a whole new world that will enthrall fantasy lovers as well. Bravo! Ms. Jackson for creating a story that readers can really sink their teeth into and enjoy, making them impatient for what comes next. Fear not, the third book in the series, The Courier, will be arriving in book stores early 2004. If it is anything like this one, it is sure to be a winner.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />What happened to Joe Mitchum?, wonders the whole town of Slapdown, TX when he goes overnight from being a ne'er-do-well to an upstanding citizen.<br /><br />Will Pendleton's life in nineteenth century Texas was going well, when a freak lightning strike took his life. He was a Texas Ranger, and darned proud of it, and he was just about to marry his lady love. Life was good... until his death. Ever since then, he has been waiting in limbo for a chance to have another lifetime with his soul mate. His chance finally comes when yet another freak lightning strike gives him the chance to take over Joe Mitchum's life and body.<br /><br />Dr. Mallory Peterson had dreamed her entire life of being a doctor. Even when the odds were stacked against her, she never gave up. After finishing her schooling, she returns to Slapdown as the local doctor, to thank them for all of their support over the years. Her life is her work, though she has never understood why she was so driven, or why deep down she feels an emptiness, one she never even noticed... until the day something extraordinary happens, changing everything.<br /><br />Joe was a slacker, drifting through his aimless life, driving Mallory crazy with his good-for-nothing ways. When he nearly dies after being struck by lightning, she saves his life, not having it in her nature to just let someone go without a fight. When he comes back from his near-death experience, he is a new man, and attempts to turn his life around. Mallory still doubts him, wondering when his slacker ways will start to reappear. What she doesn't know is that Joe is now Will, her soul mate, and that this may be the very last chance they get to be together. Now Joe and Mallory are in a race against time, and fate, for him to prove they belong together, before there are no chances left.<br /><br />Ms. Morris has written a delightful story here about soul mates and lost loves. Will is/was a morally strong man, intent on doing what was right and good, and happy in his chosen life. When all he had dreamed about was in his grasp, a cruel twist of fate snatches it away, leaving him bereft as he waits for one more chance. When he can't take the waiting anymore, he gets his chance and he grabs it with both hands. He is more than a little disturbed however, to see the mess Joe had made of his life, which now Will has to clean up.<br /><br />Mallory has spent her whole life to date on a quest for her dream, not letting anything stand in her way. Until the day that freak accident changed her life and made her realize that she was empty inside. Ms. Morris does a more than passable job of showing Mallory's growth as she comes to terms with her new feelings for Joe and what this change means to her. She goes through confusion, denial, and exploration while she tries to resolve her feelings.<br /><br />The idea of soul-mates through time and space is not a new one, but a slightly different spin is put on it in this tale. The premise of the \\"soul-switch\\" was unique, and makes the reader speculate on the \\"what ifs\\" of such an event. People will wonder, as reading the book, if reincarnation really is possible, and hopefully making them dream a little about what their past lives may have been, if anything at all. This reviewer certainly began to speculate about her own while reading this book; being a believer in past lives and soul mates.<br /><br />There is humor as well, in the form of Will's heavenly guardian, Celestian, and his bumbling through Will's (and Joe's) lives trying to make things right, but in the end making them oh-so-wrong more then once. One will chuckle more than once, upon finding out just how many mistakes were made along the way. There is also a hilarious twist at the end of this book, making the reader set the book down, upon completion, with a smile. One will be captivated by the story and this reviewer immediately went on a mission to find other books by Ms. Morrisas well.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, October 2003.

Presently the leader of his coven, he holds the future of many witches, and humans, in his grasp.  However, another witch wants the power Drake has and will do anything to get it. The only way to minimize the threat to his rule is for Drake to find his complement... the female witch who is his match in all things, who --- once they have combined forces, will make them near invincible.<br /><br />Rhea Brown has never known the legacy her grandmother left her, until she unlocks the secrets held by her parents for many years. Now she has come into her destiny, but as yet is a novice to the world of magick. Never did she see coming, the one man who would be her strength... or her undoing. Fate has a way of taking things into its own hands, as Rhea finds out when she meets her soul mate.<br /><br />Rhea and Drake's relationship begins on another plane of reality and is absolutely incredible. When they meet in person, it is just as incredible. But the evil witch conspiring to take over the coven is after Rhea as he wants her for his own... and the legendary power it will wield for him. Will Drake and Rhea overcome the evil to be together as they are fated to be?  This was a wonderful story of love and passion. Having read other works by this author under another pen name, it was expected that this book would be well written also. It did not disappoint. Ms. Morgan has a talent for weaving worlds that entrance and captivate... her own brand of magick perhaps? One will enjoy the images invoked through reading this book, wanting to believe that the magick is indeed all around, if only knowing where to look.<br /><br />Drake and Rhea are strong characters, made even stronger by their mutual attraction and love. He is a true alpha male, powerful, uncompromising, and completely wrapped up in the spell Rhea holds over him --- of a different kind of magick entirely. She is a delight as well, at first a little disbelieving of her previously unknown abilities, but who wouldn't be? However, she quickly learns how to use her magick, surprising everyone with her unmatched talent. There are several secondary characters as well that delight, making one hope more stories in the series will follow.<br /><br />As for the love scenes? Hot, hot, hot, and even hotter! Passion ignites, be it in reality or on the astral plane. The descriptions are vibrant, bringing the reader into the scenes quite completely.

Ms. Haynes proves once again she is becoming a force to be reckoned with in the paranormal romance genre.<br /><br />Jonathon \\"Spence\\" Spencer does not remember much about his past, he does not remember he was once a part of a secret organization of spies who used psychic abilities to get information on their subjects. He does not remember he was once the best man on the team, or that he used to act as an assassin for this organization. He is perfectly content in the life he has created for himself as a security systems specialist over the past 5-10 years, the close relationship he has built with his best friend Mike Gabrielli and Mike's wife and son.<br /><br />Rian Farsante works undercover for Datascape, the biggest client Spence has in his small business, and unbeknownst to him, the very agency he worked for and of which he has no memory. Her cover, and her favored career, is a licensed psychologist specializing in past life regression therapy. Her real job was to track down Spence as Datascape wants him back for a mission only he can handle. What she never counted on was the connection between her and Spence, one that has lived through several of their past lives together.<br /><br />The samurai sword that brought Mike and Dorel together, changing their lives forever and nearly killing them, has been found. Despite being destroyed several years earlier by Spence, it still holds immense power in the curse placed on it at forging. Datascape wants that power for reasons unknown to any but the highest echelons of its organization and the only one who can repair the sword and awaken the power again is the very man who destroyed it.<br /><br />Some quick thinking on Rian's part, and months of work battering down his psychic defenses, convinces Spence to allow her to regress him when he starts having unexplainable lapses of consciousness. What they find in their sessions neither expected. They have a history of past lives together as a very-much-in-love pair of soul mates. Spence's memory does begin to come back as well, having terrible consequences for him and Rian.<br /><br />The two are in a race against time when they find out Datascape wants Spence at any cost, no matter the danger to any of those Spence loves. They must solve the mystery of the sword, and unlock their secrets, before it falls into the wrong hands. They must enlist Mike and Dorel's, whose past experience with the sword changed them for good, if they hope to conquer the evil once and for all. But secrets revealed bring about a huge betrayal, making Spence doubt those closest, not knowing who to trust. Revelations about the sword and its creation shock them all, turning everything upside down, and giving more reason to fear for their lives. They find they must rely on their love of many lifetimes, and trust that, if they ever hope to survive in this one.<br /><br />Hang on to your hats, and buckle up your seatbelts! You are in for quite an adventurous ride! With a plot that spans continents... and generations; this continuation of the saga of the Sword is non-stop. There is everything that makes a good romance (and adventure) great here with a hero to die for (quite literally for some), a strong heroine who knows how to take care of herself all the while being as feminine as can be, a mystery that takes so many twists and turns one never knows which end is up, ancient curses and untold powers, an ending that just screams for another story, what more could a reader ask for?<br /><br />Be forewarned this story is not for one looking for a light read. This plot is very complex - to the point it can be slightly confusing during flashback scenes if one is not paying close attention - and requires lots of thinking to follow the threads. This is a little bit slower of a read, not because of the story, but because the reader is thinking things through as they unfold. However, this is a fascinating story, with a glimpse into the otherwordly. It is apparent that Ms. Haynes is an expert in her field, being a hypnotherapist herself, and she weaves this knowledge into her story seamlessly. Also of note, this book's ending leaves no doubt in anyone's minds that the series will continue. This reviewer doesn't know how she'll be able to wait for the next chapter in this compelling series.

Ms. Hunter has launched her new mini-series with The Seducer, and if this book is any indication, what a powerful series it will be!<br /><br />Diane Albret has lived most of her life in a girls' orphanage. She has a few memories of her parents, but not many, and her only visitor has been \\"the Devil Man\\" once a year, for his obligatory check to see how she is doing. All she hopes for is an escape from this prison-type life she has at the orphanage, so she can go on a quest to find her family. This last time when her guardian comes to see her, she has a proposal for him, one that will benefit them both, and allow her to find her answers.<br /><br />Daniel St. John was not a happy man. The Guardianship of this woman-child was not something he wanted, but it can still be used for his own purposes. He has a plan that he needs her for, one that will find him revenge for something that happened many years ago, when he was not much more then a child himself. He intends to use her to reach his dreams of revenge and won't let anything get in his way.<br /><br />Daniel brings Diane home, claiming she is a cousin for propriety's sake. He begins to have her \\"dressed for the season,\\" preparing her for her role in his plans. Everything goes along according to his plans brilliantly, except for the fact that Diane has a mind of her own and her only goal is to find information about her family - she has no intention of staying with him any longer than is absolutely necessary. Daniel's scheming brings Diane to the attention of his rival, and his plan seems to be coming to fruition, all the while placing himself and Diane in danger.<br /><br />What he is not telling Diane, is that he has ties to her past he wishes to keep secret and those ties are related to his revenge. Unfortunately Daniel,  a famed seducer, never expected the biggest flaw in his plan... that he would fall under Diane's spell and by seduced by her innocence and beauty. Should she find out his secrets, he fears she would hate him for his role in what happened to her family, or that she had in the beginning, only been a pawn in his game.<br /><br />Ms. Hunter has once again proven why she is fast becoming a household name in the Romance genre. Her talent for weaving complex storylines with strong characters is evident in this, her latest tale. Whether she chooses to write of the Middle Ages or the Regency era, she can always be counted on to impart plenty of excitement for her fans. As always, this book was well-researched, providing enough of historical fact to paint a vivid picture of the times.<br /><br />Diane and Daniel are such intriguing characters, so well drawn that the reader is drawn under their spell, feeling their passion and pain as one's own. Diane, with her innocence and strong will, is a perfect match to Daniel's intense passion and alpha tendencies. They each have their weaknesses and strengths, which when combined make them an impressive pair.<br /><br />The plot is well-done, intricately detailed with many facets and side stories that never detract from the romance between Daniel and Diane. It also introduces numerous secondary characters who enhance the story, all the while preparing the back story for each of them for their succeeding books in the series.

She has powerful visions, not unlike those experienced by her mother, New Moon. These visions have always guided Dawn on the right path, and helped her to help those closest to her. When one of these visions tells her that her dearest childhood friend, Raven Cloud is in grave danger, she knows she must do all she can to protect him. Off she goes to England to find him and keep this danger from harming him. <br /> <br />Raven has spent the past several years of his life trying to forget his heritage. He is a half-breed savage who doesn't fit into the White man's world, or the red man's world. His hatred for the unknown man who sired him has stalked his whole life, forcing his exile from the Indian town where he grew up, Chota Town, and the family who raised him. His anger is a curse, causing him to head to England to try and find the man who fathered him, then left his mother. When dawn arrives, telling him she is there to protect him, his memories of the young girl she was do not gel with the woman he has become, distracting him from his self-imposed mission. <br /> <br />Someone is trying to harm him, and the reputation as a sound businessman he has tried to build. Many of his merchandise warehouses had been burned to the ground, costing the business lots if money. He knows someone is trying to jeopardize all Raven has built for himself in England. It concerns him that Dawn had a vision and wants to help him. She is a warrior woman, who will stop at nothing to protect the man she has claimed for her own. <br /> <br />Dawn's sole purpose is to find and eliminate the threat to Raven, before it can claim his life. She has loved him her whole life and knows he is the only man for her. But he scoffs at her attempts to help him and remind him of whom he really is. He is drawn to her as well, but refuses to accept her Cherokee ways and doesnot wish to draw her into the danger surrounding him, or his quest for vengeance. Dawn knows they are meant to be together, her visions have told her so, but how can she make Raven accept that as well? And how can she protect him when he is trying so hard to avoid her? Dawn finds her biggest job of all is to convince Raven to acknowledge his heritage, before they can be together for always. <br /> <br />This was a compelling read, from the pen of Mary Adair. Golden Dawn is quite the warrior, willing to go to great lengths to protect her man. Nothing can stop her from reaching her goals. Raven is consumed by his hatred of the man who fathered him and scorns his native heritage. Only dawn has the power to break through to him, all the more reason for him to try to keep his distance. These two are perfect for each other, obvious to the reader, even though Raven himself refuses to admit it. <br /> <br />There is a good deal of suspense in this novel, and the mystery underlying everything is engrossing. One will make numerous guesses to who is the guilty party, changing their mind repeatedly, until the surprise of who exactly it is. Also of note, is Raven's quest for his father. One will be stunned to find out who it is, though in the end, the reader will be surprised at not figuring it out sooner. A touch of the mystical is evident as well, in Dawn's powers of foresight and her ability to sometimes bring on a vision at a moment's notice. <br /> <br />This is a good story, not as gripping for this reviewer as some other books read, but still kept the interest until the end. Ms. Adair shows promise as a writer and this reviewer would be interested to see how future books pan out for the author. <br /> <br /> Kelley A. Hartsell, September 2002.

Her young son had died in an accident, but she had donated his organs so other children could live. Unfortunately, the agony of her loss tears at her, interfering with her career as a schoolteacher, and her ability to continue to live on with the memory of her son. In a last ditch effort to deal with her pain, and save her job, she volunteers for the summer at Camp Firefly Wishes, a special camp for transplant children and their families. She has no desire to be there, all of those children being memories of her little boy.<br /><br />James McClain is a single father first, a psychologist second, with an eight-year-old daughter, Molly, who is the recipient of a new heart. His wife left him when she could not handle the pressures of raising a daughter with a severe, life-endangering heart defect. He is terrified of anything happening to Molly, going to the extremes to protect her, to the point of excess. Molly only wants to have a normal summer with other children her age.<br /><br />When James and Rachel meet, they are both attracted to each other, though they are both in denial. Rachel has so much pain, she has no desire to take interest in anyone, especially a man who with his daughter, embodies Rachel's worst nightmare, that of losing a child. James cares only about keeping Molly healthy and safe and has no interest in a woman who seems cold in her inability to accept the children at this camp for what they are, little miracles of life running around. In fact, in spite of his attraction, he wants to hate her for her attitude. Molly likes Rachel, in spite of the sadness in her eyes and heart, and decides she is the perfect woman to get her Dad to loosen up and let her have some fun.<br /><br />So Molly schemes with her best friend, to throw her dad and Miss Rachel together as often as possible, hoping that would be enough of a distraction to give her some time for fun. But the more she gets to know Miss Rachel, the more Molly decided she is the perfect candidate to be her new Mommy. It works too, for a while, her Dad and Miss Rachel seem to get along so well. But after James discovers Rachel's real reason for being at Camp Firefly Wishes, he begins to doubt even more whether she could handle the pressures of being a parent to a child with a severe illness.<br /><br />Can Rachel get past her fear of loving and losing another child dear to her? Will James accept her, faults and all, to be a part of his family? Will Molly's own private firefly wishes be enough to bridge the gap?<br /><br />This is one phenomenal story so full of emotion that one is captured in its pages.

A Little Secret (Harlequin Superromance No. 1204)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A special story which will tug at the heartstrings	Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />If looking for a special story which will tug at the heartstrings, this is certainly a book to read.<br /><br />Lexie Jacobs fled Erie, PA four years ago, to protect the baby she carried. She had only the clothes on her back and minimal money in her pocket, but none of that mattered if she could save the baby. She has made a new life for herself and her baby, Sarah, in Montana. She couldn't be happier in her life until the day he tracks her down...<br /><br />David Mitchell is the father of little Sarah, who has spent a long time trying to track down the woman who ran off with his daughter. He and his wife had been unable to have children, so when Lexie agreed to be a surrogate mother, he thought all his dreams were coming true... until she vanished.<br /><br />When David arrives in Mill Creek, Montana, Lexie is terrified. She is certain he is going to take Sarah away, and there is nothing she can do about it, after all she isn't even her mother. What she wasn't counting on was a resurgence of emotions she had thought long-buried. When David makes her a proposal that may solve all their problems, she has to decide, give up on the dreams she's long carried or hold on to them and see what happens. What she doesn't know is that David may very well hold that dream in the palm of his hand, and the heart of a little girl.<br /><br />Ms. Gable once again proves she is a master at touching her readers' hearts with her books. Lexie is torn between what is right for Sarah and what is right for her and David. She has always cared deeply for him, holding on to hopes she is almost afraid to admit to. When they meet up again, David is upset that he has lost so much time with Sarah, missing milestone events for which he was supposed to be there. But in spite of his feelings, he realizes he can't bring himself to hurt Lexie by taking away the daughter of her heart, if not her blood. Long denied and unknown feelings rise to the surface, culminating in a love they have never known... with each other.<br /><br />As always, the reader's heart will be invested in the outcome of the story. One will get misty-eyed along with David when he realizes he has won the love of his beautiful daughter. Lexie's agony over the chance of losing her whole world becomes the reader's own. All of the characters in the tale, all of the townsfolk of Lexie's adopted home, will make their world a real one. Who can not be drawn into the lives of these loving people? This reviewer was so enraptured, she almost expected to turn around and see them walking down the sidewalk.<br /><br />Additionally, she shows no fear at tackling very sensitive issues. In this book she touches on more then one, surrogate parents, mental illness, and laser treatments for children (Sarah has a large birthmark on her cheek.). Surrogate parenthood has often been a hot topic... who does have rights when the child is in danger? As for the laser treatments to improve Sarah's face... when is it OK to take such risks? Each of these subjects is covered fully in this book, making the reader understand the choices made.<br /><br />Simply put, if readers want a moving story that will suck them in and not let go, making them feel strong emotions, Whose Child? is guaranteed to fit the bill.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

In this book she touches on more then one, surrogate parents, mental illness, and laser treatments for children (Sarah has a large birthmark on her cheek.). Surrogate parenthood has often been a hot topic... who does have rights when the child is in danger? As for the laser treatments to improve Sarah's face... when is it OK to take such risks? Each of these subjects is covered fully in this book, making the reader understand the choices made.    Simply put, if readers want a moving story that will suck them in and not let go, making them feel strong emotions, Whose Child? is guaranteed to fit the bill.    © Kelley A. Hartsell, April 2004.

With plenty of intrigue to deepen the plot, the reader will be unable to put this book down, waiting for what comes next.<br /><br />Vergil Duclairc, also called Laclere, likes to have things done his way. Since his older brother, the Viscount, died, he has had to take on much responsibility for his family - a responsibility and title he had never desired. His brother's death changed him, forcing him to become less carefree about his actions. As a result of the now strict code Vergil keeps for himself, he is called \\"the Saint\\" by those close to him.<br /><br />Bianca Kenwood is an American. She has come to England with her companion, Jane, as the ward of Viscount Vergil Duclairc. However, she has no desire to be under the thumb of one such as he... she desires to go to Milan to seek training and fulfill her only dream, to be a professional singer. Her plan is to get Vergil to relinquish his duty as her guardian so she can go to Italy, using money from her inheritance.<br /><br />These two are at odds from the moment they meet. Bianca only wants to be granted her freedom, whereas Vergil has other plans for her... and her inheritance. He is on a mission to find out what drove his brother to take his own life, all the while preserving his family's name and good standing in society. Bianca is only a means to an end for him, until he begins to realize he cares for her more then a guardian should. She chafes at his strict control over her so she is determined to do whatever it takes to get him to release her, though in time she grows to question whether or not she wants to be free of him for good.<br /><br />However, the mystery deepens as Vergil begins to uncover a chain of events in which his brother was just one link, putting his and Bianca's lives in danger. Will he solve the mystery behind his brother's untimely demise? Can Bianca and Vergil overcome their differences to find the passion they both long for?<br /><br />The reader is reintroduced to beloved secondary characters from The Seducer, showing what has become of them in the time lapsing between the two books. Vergil is a changed man, having been through a lot, making him grow up and mature from the romantic he was, to the driven man he has become, the \\"saint.\\" Bianca is refreshingly innocent, or so she seems until one gets to know her better. Who she is truly, is a strong-minded young lady, with the gumption to do something about it. Naive in many ways, she still knows a lot more about life than would be expected of a young lady of the time. From the moment these two meet, with Bianca dressed up in an elaborate opera costume, the sparks fly, which neither one was expecting.<br /><br />The plot is complex as well, unfolding in layers, which only enhance the story. Multiple secrets are entwined, causing Vergil's discreet investigation to take many turns, most of which only increase the risk of danger for his family. When he finds a string of blackmail incidents that all lead to one place, the mystery deepens as the reader, along with Vergil, strives to find the answers. Ms. Hunter skillfully weaves the tale, throwing a couple of wrong turns into the mix, by providing false trails to follow. This reviewer was delighted by the fact she had no idea who the real villain was, until the climactic scene resolving it all, which is quite surprising and not at all what was expected.<br /><br />One will also be happy to visit with previously introduced characters. This book, though part of a series, is a stand-alone. However, this reviewer recommends reading The Seducer first, as it helps one to better know our hero and his friends. It also sets up the rest of the series nicely, providing enough additional information about those featured in the coming books to make the reader want to know more about them. A fast-paced, emotional story, this book comes highly recommended. Go out and get a copy today.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, October 2003. All rights reserved.oday.     © Kelley A.

Well, fellow readers, if you suspected, you were right and Lovehandles is their story.<br /><br />Peter \\"Punch\\" O'Brien and Judy Bently have been partners on their morning show for a year now and they drive each other crazy. Their bantering back and forth sends ratings high, though since listeners love the interaction between the two. Something has changed however in the past few months, being noticed for the first time at the wedding of Ethan and Mary, the contestants from the contest WVLH sponsored over the summer, who found love in the cab of a truck.<br /><br />Now suddenly things are not the same for Punch and Judy as they discover maybe they feel more for each other then just camaraderie and friendship... and business. Peter was burned years ago in a relationship with a coworker so has sworn off getting involved with women that he works with. Judy believes no man could ever be attracted to her, especially someone as incredibly handsome as Peter. But as sparks continue to fly and things heat up, will they discover happiness with each other and prove once again that at WLVH, \\"love is more then just a song?\\"<br /><br />Peter and Judy are total opposites in everything they think and do, grating on each other's nerves all the while the friendship between them grows. Judy is a simple woman with simple hopes and dreams, never asking for anything spectacular. She moves through her life, content in the path she has chosen, even if she sometimes wonders whether she'll ever turn the head of a man who appeals to her. Peter is drop-dead gorgeous, full of charm that women of all ages can't resist. He's perfectly happy cruising through relationships on a very regular basis, never developing anything beyond a casual fling. When Judy starts to realize there is more between them then just friendship, it scares her because she is a \\"forever\\" kind of woman and Peter is a \\"just for now\\" kind of man. As readers watch their relationship grow and change, they'll cheer them on to discovering that what they really want... and need... is each other.<br /><br />As always in a book by Holly Jacobs, humor abounds and brings joy and laughter to the hearts of the readers. One will laugh out loud at the antics of these two lovebirds and at the crazy events their boss has them participating in to boost ratings even more. Sparkling wit and sometimes quirky dialogue keeps one reading through the end of the story, just waiting to see what Peter and Judy will be up to next.<br /><br />Secondary characters are always strong additions to any story by Ms. Jacobs, and this book is no exception.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />This was a fascinating fantasy romance by the talented Karen McCullough that will carry readers away into another world where dragons live and wizards dream.<br /><br />Alsa feels the stirrings of wizardry within her and makes a desperate bargain with a reclusive wizard to expand them. She needs to learn to use her magick to aid her village in winning a battle against amassed enemies who could wipe out everything she has ever known. She asks the wizard Korlen to teach her in the ways of magick and in exchange, she will bear him the son he desires, so as to pass his powers on to the next in his line.<br /><br />Her adventure thus begins when she learns magick is not what she thought, nor is training in her abilities anything she ever would have expected. In the months spent with Korlen, she discovers many hard lessons about his way of life, soon to become hers once her training is complete. Never in a million years though, did either of them expect what the greatest lesson of all would be... that of sacrificing all for love. Can he help her learn what she needs to help her village survive? Can she finally begin to comprehend the choices he has made in his life, and how they will change her forever?<br /><br />This is a delightful story and Ms. McCullough proves once again why she is a rising star in the world of romance. The world-building is vivid and has so many facets to it that readers will feel as though they are in the village with Alsa and her family, or in the castle where she learns wizardry. Landscapes are so beautiful that one senses the faint stirrings of Breath, the air elemental whom Alsa befriends, and feels the pillowy softness of the rainbow bridge under her feet as she crosses into the wizard's lair.<br /><br />Most of the characters are skillfully rendered and full of life, from Dragon, the sulky, yet satisfied guardian of the castle and rainbow bridge, to Dortee, the wizard healer, to Adam the precocious child of Korlen and Alsa. Alsa comes across as a brave and selfless young lady willing to do anything to help the village she loves, yet vulnerable enough to cry over the accidental damage she causes in her lessons in magick.<br /><br />Korlen is a complex individual. He is a loner; having withdrawn from others after something scarred him emotionally in his past, and is afraid to speak of his feelings, even if he's not afraid to show them in other ways. One will love him for his vulnerability at the same time as being frustrated with his refusal to interact with others. The only thing this reviewer would have liked to see regarding him is a look into the events in his past that is alluded to many times throughout the story, but never explained. That is left out and this reviewer can't help but feel that may have made her understand him even more.<br /><br />In short, this is a very satisfying and quick read that will captivate readers from the first page all the way through to the beautiful happy ending.

Maybe?<br /><br />Cara Romano needs to make an escape... and fast.<br /><br />Cara's mother was arranging surprise visits with all the eligible men she can find, in hopes of winning a bet with a friend, and Cara has had enough! On her spring break from the school she teaches at, she makes a break for Houston, TX, to visit her good friends, Kate and Tony Donetti. Now begins ten days of sheer bliss, away from her mother and her scheming, away from anyone who could possibly track her down. She is going to indulge herself on vacation, doing many of the things she had dreamed about. Her very first day in Texas, she bumps into, quite literally, the man of her dreams... Or should she say fantasies?<br /><br />Rex Noble is a businessman. He just has a different kind of business... a sperm bank for cattle, started with the purchase of his prized bull. A favor to a friend has him getting a new ad campaign going, to keep ahead of competitors, and it has some shocking results. He is livid over the disaster, and this could wreak havoc on his business, but he never expected it would also be a turning point for his personal life as well. Until the day he bumps into a vision of perfect beauty; and no one will tell him who she is.<br /><br />Upon seeing a certain billboard for Noble Sperm Bank, it suddenly hits Cara... she longs for a child more then anything, but can do without the husband to get one. What better solution then to go to the sperm bank for artificial insemination? The more she thinks about it, the more she loves the idea, especially when her imaginings about the donor take on the visage of a rather sexy Texan. She is more then a little surprised to find the doctor at the sperm bank is none other then her fantasy man, but is even more surprised to realize this is not the type of sperm bank she was looking for! Afraid to admit her mistake, she plays along, hoping to indulge in a little fling with her sexy doctor, and maybe get some sperm the old fashioned way! Rex is happy to oblige, at first, until he begins to suspect her reasons for seeking out his business in the first place.<br /><br />What can a person say? This book was hilarious! The bet between Cara's mother, and her friend (whose daughter is featured in the second story of this Duets volume) is a good premise for the stories and adds an extra margin of humor. Plenty of borderline slapstick comedy occurs throughout the book as well, in the by-play between Rex and Cara.<br /><br />Cara is the stereotypical elementary school teacher, until she decides to let loose and have a ball on her vacation. Her inner musings about who she was and who she wants to be are a nice look at why she is the way she is. When she decides what she really wants is a baby, she sets out to reach that goal right away, hoping to surprise everyone when she goes home. No one would ever expect reserved Cara to go and do something crazy like get artificially inseminated!<br /><br />Rex is a perfect hero, tall dark and handsome, crazy enough about Cara to imitate a Romeo and Juliet type scene when he doesn't even know her name. When she shows up at his clinic and spins him a story about wanting to buy a farm, excuse me, ranch!, and some cattle, he is surprised but pleased. He was intrigued by her before he knew her and was even more so after hearing her \\"plan,\\" and jumps on the chance to assist her.<br /><br />When these two get together, their mutual fascination flares out of control, igniting a passion neither was expecting. What Cara had intended for a fling, turns into something more, that she hopes he wants as well. It also adds plenty of opportunity for the addition of even more humor to the story, making the reader laugh out loud at what could be rather inopportune moments, depending on where the book is being read. Though this reviewer is sorry to see the Harlequin Duets series end, they could not have picked a better book to use as the grand finale. Also, this is one reviewer who looks forward to seeing more from Ms. Tucker hopefully in the new Flipside line.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, September 2003.

The beginning stages of The Plague had just manifested in his squire, William and now the townsfolk of Brest, in Brittany, are after them. Morvan takes up refuge in an old longhouse, preparing to await his fate, preferring to die at the hands of angry peasants rather then in the throes of this most dreaded disease. Just as his fate seems sealed, she comes roaring to his rescue.<br /><br />Anna de Leon was a unique woman in her time. She answered to no man, rather they answered to her, as the commander of the castle and its men. She is not like any woman Morvan has ever known. Anna has already suffered through, and survived the illness now stalking Morvan and his men, so she calls the villagers off, telling them to leave him be and she will take care of him. Thus begins a special relationship between them, as she fights for his life beside him.<br /><br />The time they spend together bonds them in a way neither understands, yet both treasure. A reluctant friendship grows that turns into something more. But the idyllic time as he recovers is short-lived. Anna believes no man could ever be attracted to one such as herself, for she acts and looks more man then woman, in her eyes. When a past enemy, Gurwant de Beaumanoir, returns to conquer her home, and herself, she cannot just stand by and let others fight her battles for her, and Morvan finds out first hand what an amazing, but individual woman she is. All he wants is to protect her, and all she wants is her freedom and independence to protect herself.  So begins Morvan's real battle, the battle for the love of a special woman. But can he accept her for the woman she is or will he tamp down the fiery spirit that makes her who she is, and what he really loves?<br /><br />Ms. Hunter has written a wonderful medieval tale, with everything one expects from a good romance. Morvan and Anna are powerful individuals who in the beginning can't decide if they would rather be adversaries or allies. Her fiery spirit is the perfect tempering to his dominating presence. Passion flares so brightly the reader has no choice but to be drawn under its spell. Gurwain is brilliantly done, coming across as a brutal and malevolent man. One feels the blackness of his soul which needs defeating. All of the characters are skillfully rendered, from the gentle-hearted Ascanio, a warrior priest, to Anna's younger sister, Catherine, who is experiencing her own first love, to all of the vassals and servants of Anna's family. Every single soul is a delightful addition to the tale unwinding.<br /><br />The action is well-paced, with several pivotal moments leading up to the final climactic battle scene. This reviewer likes how each thread of the tale is woven, with its own culmination, so the story can slow down just enough to prepare the reader for the next turn of events to unfold. The full plot ebbs and flows, reeling one in, to let go, only to real the reader back in for an even more exciting stage. Ms Hunter also brilliantly captures, without over-glorifying, or over-dramatizing, the feel of the time period and the people.

However, she also focuses on the happiness and simplicity of the people, in the midst of a war.<br /><br />This was an enchanting book, and proves why Ms. Hunter is fast rising in popularity, to become a household name in the romance world.

Tayg has proven his merit in the Army of King Robert the Bruce, yet he never aspired to be more than a soldier free of responsibility, a charming one available to woo all the young lasses he desired. But that is not meant to be. Now he must assume what should have been his brother's duties to protect his clan and support his King. He must now settle down and find a wife to be by his side for his new future... But not before getting in one more adventure. He undertakes one more mission for his King, buying himself some time before he has to settle down and marry.<br /><br />Catriona MacLeod has ever been the shrew, to protect herself from the indignities forced upon her by her brothers, and their cruel treatment of her. When she discovers she is being forced to wed Duff \\"Dogface\\" MacDonell, a man she has always despised, to cement the alliance between their clans, she has had enough. She flees, hoping to make it to her aunt's village, where she can live in peace and out of the reach of her brother's greedy reach. Unfortunately, her sense of direction is far from astute and she finds herself lost just as the typical highland winter storms begin. Stumbling upon a lowly bard, they travel together to find safety from the elements.<br /><br />This second book by relative newcomer Ms. Wittig again showcases her talent for portraying characters clamoring to be heard. Tayg and Cat are personalities full of such life and vigor that one can't help but love them both. Cat is vulnerable but fiery, hiding years of pain between her harsh tongue and prickly façade. When she finally learns to let someone in, to get to know the real Catriona, readers too will love her. Tayg has ever been the warrior \\"playboy.\\" All he wants is for someone to like him for himself, not the heartbreaker he acted for years, or his prowess as a soldier for the King.

When he and Cat come together, it is guaranteed that their love will be as vibrant and passionate as they are.<br /><br />Adventure abounds in this story as well.

They'll feel as though they are in the story with Tayg and Cat, suffering through the biting winds and deep snows. This is most certainly one book which will wrap fans of Ms. Wittig, be they old or new, in its clutches, holding tight through the end of tale.<br /><br />It was truly a pleasure for this reviewer to once again get to experience the magic of this Rising Star of Romance. One can only hope more fascinating stories will follow in the wake of the incredible Charming the Shrew.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, April 2004.

She has a unique ability of touch that bonds her to all leaf-eating creatures. This makes her able to hear them and communicate with them, showing her what they know. However, her gift is fading. If she does not find someone to sire a girl-child for her, the gift will die, unable to be passed on into the future.<br /><br />Val is Danir...Viking... sent to the land of Saxons to help hold the borders for his leader, and to teach these people the way of Law, a previously unknown concept outside of Danir lands. He sees this opportunity as the final chance to prove his loyalty to his king, having failed in the past to set aside his desire to protect the weak, for the benefit of his King.<br /><br />Val is in for a challenge when he arrives in Saxony. He sees a vision of Pagan beauty, white-haired, white-skinned, whom is near-worshipped by the people, even respected by the followers of Jesu. Epona is in the company of his enemy Albert, the idealistic boy-king of this land. Val needs her, as does Albert, to cement his claim as ruler. Both also need the horses to which she is bonded. Val never expected the desire he feels for this woman so full of strength and calm. Epona only wishes to birth her girl-child and pass on her ancient gift, but this wish is quickly complicated by the attraction she feels for the foreign warrior/Viking. How can she feel tender emotions for one of a believed vile race of people? As tensions build and conflicts mount, Epona and Val must decide... Work together and allow their feelings to grow or accept that their conflicting worlds will forever keep them apart.<br /><br />This should have been an intriguing tale, but this reviewer could not become engrossed in the story. Though there is some strong character development, Pony and Val just didn't captivate attention enough. There are glimmers of what drives them, and the reader will feel their respective internal conflicts, but it just wasn't enough for an emotional investment in this story.<br /><br />There are some fascinating plot elements found in the merging of two very different cultures of people - one with a developed system of Law and one disorganized where the \\"law\\" changes with the regions held by different land barons. There is also the interesting conflict of religions - Paganism as old as time, and the newly born Christianity. How they blend probably would keep a reader interested. However, there are several parts of the story that drag, causing this reviewer to lose interest.<br /><br />Ms. Squires must be commended for her obviously intensive research into the time period, the cultures, and even the language. It is extremely apparent she did her homework before penning this novel. That comes across in her descriptive prose. History lovers will especially enjoy those facets of this book.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, March 2004. All rights reserved.l just didn't captivate attention enough.

Rest assured, this story was well worth waiting for.<br /><br />Dayan has been searching for centuries to find the one woman who can complete him, who can balance the darkness in his soul with the light of her love. He has recently watched each of the members of his family find their lifemates, and he was beginning to despair of ever finding his own. While running from some enemies determined to destroy him and those traveling with him, something drives him to stop at a bar and perform some of his music. While there, he feels a change, suddenly noticing she is there, and his world explodes into color.<br /><br />Corinne Wentworth has been ill her entire life. She suffers from a degenerative heart disease, which is slowly eating away at her life. Additionally, she is pregnant with the child of her late husband, possibly killed by the same people hunting Dayan. She has been entranced with music, especially that of the Dark Troubadours, for a very long time. Their music speaks to her, taking her out of her troubled existence, freeing her from the constraints of her poor health. When her best friend, Lisa, decides to surprise her by taking her to a local bar where one of the famed Troubadours will be playing, she never expected her life would change so drastically.<br /><br />Immediately, Dayan knows Corinne is his lifemate, but he has a dilemma no one of his kind has ever dealt with before. She is dying, along with her unborn child, of her heart disease, and there is nothing he can do to save her at this time. He must call on his family, and the greatest healers of the Carpathians to aid him in saving his lifemate, for if she dies, he will be lost as well. All must come together in the race against time and their common enemy, (a group of fanatics out to destroy anyone they believe to be vampire, human and Carpathian alike) to save Corinne's life and that of her unborn child.<br /><br />Not much more can be said about this story's plot, without giving away any key elements. This is a story to be savored, for it has so much more to it than many of the preceding books. This reviewer is very selective when rating books, not liking to give out the highest ratings possible to books unless they are truly deserving of it, near perfect in every way.<br /><br />Ms. Feehan has filled this book with so much emotion, that one will be overwhelmed, becoming totally engrossed in the lives of the characters. The reader will laugh, cry, rage at fate, be overjoyed, and cry some more. Be forewarned, this is not a book to be taken lightly, nor to be read in a restaurant full of people, or a lot of strange looks will be received over the tears pouring down one's cheeks. This reviewer speaks from experience. Ms. Feehan is a master of drawing her readers into her world, feeling so much for her characters, but this book... this book is the most heart-wrenching to date. In addition to the emotional story of Corinne and Dayan, this is the long-awaited \\"reunion\\" story, bringing together so many of the beloved characters from past books, as they all work together to save Corinne. The final climactic scene, to save her life, is so well-done, so powerful, one is afraid to breathe until it is over, begging for the conclusion so longed for.<br /><br />Every book in the Dark saga is character driven, though with a strong plot to support the characters. This one however, is even more so, due to the nature of Dayan and Corinne's relationship. She is restricted by her health, less able to have adventures, but there is still enough action to keep one captivated, driving on towards the desired happy ending. What else can be said about this story? Ms. Feehan is a master, her voice as fresh and new as it was with her first book. There can be no doubt in anyone's minds that she is bound for bigger and better things, guaranteed to please even the most particular of readers.

She is relatively independent, well schooled, and a career woman. She is content in her job at the museum, spending her days with the priceless artifacts she works with. Though her new life seems to be going well, she has never forgotten the one man who stole her heart years ago, her ex-husband - the only man she has ever loved.<br /><br />Sir Christopher Donally has overcome his less then stellar past to make a new mark on society with his architecture company. His business is taking off and they are in the running for some high dollar government projects. However, as well as he seems to be doing now, he can't get out of his mind the only woman who ever truly mattered to him. So when he bumps into her quite by accident after 10 years, all those old feelings come rushing back.<br /><br />Alex never in a million years expected to see Christopher again, especially as a member of the board for her museum! When she discovers that someone has been stealing jewels from the museum she goes straight to her boss, who promptly accuses her, damaging her reputation. There is no one she can think of for help, so she turns to Christopher for aid. He agrees, the price being she'll sponsor his sister in society. However, long buried feelings begin to bubble up, reminding them both of what they once had. Will they solve the mystery of who is stealing artifacts? Can they overcome their past to find the love they are destined for?<br /><br />Ms. Thomas has told a wonderful tale here, with strong characters. Alex and Christopher are a perfect pair who, though unable to overcome the obstacles in their way the first time around, now have a second chance at the love of which they never let go. They are perfect complements for each other and give everyone hopes of someday finding that special kind of love. The secondary characters are also wonderful, from Christopher's sister Brianna and the rest of his rambunctious family and friends, to Alex's cold father, to the museum employees.<br /><br />The mystery of the missing pieces at the museum is well done, and though a big part of the storyline, it never overwhelms the real story - Alex and Christopher's romance. There is enough action surrounding this part of the plot to keep the reader turning pages, as if the heat from Alex and Christopher's relationship isn't enough. The resolution of the mystery is not too surprising, even with the few false trails thrown in. However, this reviewer didn't figure it out until the end, probably due to focusing on the romance part of the story.<br /><br />All in all, this book was delightful and a wonderful way to spend the hours. One will be carried along on the waves of Alex and Christopher's love, wishing real life could go the same. The best part of the book, for this reviewer was the fact it proves time resolves issues, when love in strong enough. It proves fate always has its way, even when it looks like things can't work out. It will give the reader a sense of hope, that even when one feels down, \\"what's meant to be will be.\\" The worst thing about this story? That it had to end.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />This story was indeed a fairy tale... with a twist.<br /><br />Elena Klovis had lived a life of servitude. Her home is in the Five Hundred Kingdoms, where magic and Tradition rule. Her role was to have been the Cinderella of her kingdom but fate had other plans and left her stuck in a life where she didn't belong.<br /><br />Instead, her Fairy Godmother takes her under her wing as an apprentice, preparing Elena to become the next Fairy Godmother, When Elena takes over, things are totally different than she had ever expected, and she has her share of frustrations as well as adventures. Especially when she turns a prince into a donkey to teach him manners and respect, and brings him home to work!<br /><br />Thus begins her greatest adventure yet.<br /><br />If one is looking for a fantasy tale that is intriguing and full of humor, this is the book to buy. This story has plenty of excitement and adventure to appeal to the most die-hard of fantasy lovers. The details of Elena's duties as Godmother are well done, making it believable, and possibly even making the readers wish to have their own Godmothers to assist in times of trial and need.<br /><br />There is a romance here as well, though it is by no means the focus of the story, nor is it meant to be. The hero doesn't even make his first appearance until halfway through the book. However, even though the romance is not the primary storyline, it is woven seamlessly into the story, making it a natural progression of the plot line, and sure to attract the interest of romance lovers.<br /><br />This is a strong story by the well-known and talented Ms. Lackey to launch the new Luna line by Harlequin, and is sure to attract new and old fans of the author, and the genre.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

He and his military unit, dubbed the Ghostwalkers, volunteered for a top secret experiment involving enhancement of natural psychic abilities. All of them had some ability to begin with, Ryland's being the strongest. He is a brave and powerful man, loyal to his men and loyal to his country. Unfortunately for him, some are not loyal to such noble causes, only themselves.<br /><br />Dr. Lily Whitney is the daughter of the scientist, Dr. Peter Whitney, heading the experiment, and she is not without incredible abilities of her own. When her father requests her assistance on his program gone awry, she is more then happy to assist him. She is confused by the information she gleans in her visit there, but the most shocking thing of all is her connection to the one called Ryland.<br /><br />Lily and Ryland bond immediately and he sees her as the one person he can trust. He knows she is the woman for him and will prove that to her as well. Then... some of his men have disappeared, presumed dead, and he believes her father is a part of some larger plot to destroy them all and protect the knowledge they have gleaned. But there are unexpected side effects from the experiment - the men cannot control some of their abilities and suffer severe pain as a side effect.<br /><br />When Lily's father is murdered, it is up to Ryland and Lily to resolve how to save the men and figure out who killed Peter Whitney... and why. However, long buried secrets come bubbling up, along with memories, making Lily doubt everything she has ever known. Also, somewhere, somehow, there is a traitor in their midst, someone willing to sell out on their country, their secrets, and their lives. Will Lily, Ryland, and the Ghostwalkers solve the mystery before they all end up dead?<br /><br />All this reviewer can say is WOW!!! Ms. Feehan packs such a punch with this story it will leave one gasping for breath. She conquers yet another genre of romance with ease, proving why she is a master. There is just enough of a touch of the \\"paranormal\\" to remind the reader where she got her start. But that is where the similarities between this story and the Dark saga end.

Courtesy of Love Romances Reviews<br /><br />This is the best book, yet, that this reviewer has read by the talented Elaine Corvidae. This conclusion to the Lord of Wind and Fire trilogy will leave readers breathless and wishing it didn't have to end.<br /><br />This story starts up where book 2, The Crow Queen left off, with Yozerf thought dead by his companions and his mate, Suchen Keblava. What they don't realize is that he did in fact escape the fiery aftermath of their climactic battle in Segg, though he suffered some grave injuries and a bout of amnesia. He is found in wolf form, by a young human girl who nurses him back to health. Once recovered, he and Owl, as he has dubbed the child, head off in search of the rest of his pack... and Suchen.<br /><br />Suchen, Londah, Lord Auglar and their remaining companions are on their way to Kellsjard in hopes to regroup and have another chance to make their stand against enemies so Auglar can win his rightful place as King of Jenel. Along the way they run into many difficulties and start to lose hope. Angler's beloved wife is thought dead, most of his Sworn have been killed, and Suchen tries to overcome her heartbreak over losing Yozerf.<br /><br />On his journey, Yozerf finds himself to be the head of a band of refugees that is made up of all races, human, Wolfkin, and Aclytese, all hoping to escape the destruction as well. Suchen, Londah and Auglar are in for the surprise of their lives however, when they finally find refuge at Vorslava, formerly their rival Fellrant's keep. However, circumstances are still dire and everyone's last hope resides in Yozerf, and the ancient magic of his bloodline. Can they ever really win this war and will Yozerf's fate be enough to save the land and his people?<br /><br />This story is incredible! Beautifully written with vivid imagery and strong plot, Ms. Corvidae once again enchants her readers with her otherworldly tale. She also has incredibly talent for getting to her reader's hearts and emotions. This reviewer laughed, screamed, cheered, and cried throughout this story. Some scenes are so heart-wrenching that one will want to have some tissues on hand for wiping up the tears bound to flow as a result.<br /><br />All the loose ends from the previous two books are tied up and resolved in such a way that fans are more then satisfied at the turn of events. They will also learn much more about Ax and Jahcgroth and their roles in the chain of events and their reasons behind it.

Londah remains a mystery in many ways, but reader swill also get more of a glimpse into her past as well. She is this reviewer's favorite character in the trilogy, with her pent up remorse over things done and her ever present love for her son. She is such a complex character that readers still may not know by the end of this book, everything about her and why she is who she is.<br /><br />The conclusion to this book, and the trilogy, is so incredibly climactic that one will be left breathless when all the dust settles in the final battle. It is shocking, stunning, dramatic, and intense, gripping all of the emotions of the readers tightly in its grasp.

Courtesy of Love Romances Reviews<br /><br />Burning Bright is a heart-warming collection of seasonal stories encompassing the holidays of different religions. With the common denominator being the town they all take place in and a tiny little candle shop that is unusual and mysterious, it will touch all who read it.<br /><br />In Star Light, Star Bright by Anne Stuart, readers meet Angela \\"Angel\\" McKenna, a new divorcee who is hoping to rebuild her life. Will a new love with an old flame be the answer to her Christmas wish? Brody Jackson has returned to Crescent Cove, Vermont to lick his wounds caused by the scandal surrounding the company he owned with his brothers. All he wants is to hide from the world, but when Angel shows up on his doorstep, he decides maybe it is time to come out of his shell for a new start.<br /><br />What is a more perfect time for a renewal of life's dreams than at Christmas? Angel is slowly recovering from the crushing blow given her when her husband divorced her. After suffering through one year where she had no desire to celebrate the holiday, she decides this year is the time to start. Angel almost puts Santa Claus to shame with the amount of good cheer she spreads. Her newfound good will is a delight to encounter for the reader. Brody starts out as something of a Scrooge, with reason, but in the face of Angel's spirit, and a rekindling of that old ember of desire long ago sparked and banked, his turn around is easy to understand.<br /><br />In Return of the Light by Maggie Shayne, Dori Stewart was a very important person in her Manhattan life. When everything crashes down around her, including her fantastic job and her key role in her local Coven, she comes home to Vermont to find out what went wrong. She has lost her faith in everything, including the Goddess, but maybe with the help of Jason Farrar, the local police chief and an old time fling of hers, she'll make a new start on the winter solstice.<br /><br />Dori started out as a woman who has it all, and one who has forgotten just who it was that blessed her with that gifted life. When she loses everything she held dear, her faith dies with it. Or does it? She forgets for a while how important her beliefs are, but when her eyes are reopened, the outpouring of relief and hope she feels changes her in a good way. Jason has a hard time understanding her beliefs at first, but later comes to understand just how important they are to her. Another thing enjoyable about this story is how the author takes the scorn that others have for Dori's religion and turns it around, lighting up the whole town with the spirit of fellowship and understanding.<br /><br />In the third and final story in the collection, One for Each Night by Judith Arnold, Alana Ross, a local news reporter, is holding her first Hanukkah open house in memory of her grandmother. However, things get hairy when Jeffrey Barrett arrives in town. His uncle was implicated in an embezzlement scandal involving school board funds and Alana is not afraid to report the facts or local suspicions. As his uncle's attorney, Jeffrey tries to get to the bottom of things, but finds he'd rather get up close and personal with Alana. Will her holiday celebration involve a new love?<br /><br />What seasonal collection at this time of year would be complete without a Hanukkah story? Alana's faith is strong, as are the memories she holds of her beloved grandmother. Her entire celebration is as much about her holiday as it is keeping her grandmother alive in her heart. It was fun to read about the different delicacies that go along with the holiday tradition. Jeffrey has his doubts about Alana, feeling she is pushing too hard to ruin his uncle's reputation, but as he learns more about her and her history, he slowly comes to understand why she feels the way she does about her news reporting.

She was immortal, a vampire, converted two centuries previous, by her evil twin sister, Zariaz. Presently, Ash is a photographer, well known for her photos of popular musicians. Her latest job is with the up and coming band, Darkside. Little does she know fate's plans for her brought on by this job.<br /><br />Liam Archer is the lead singer for Darkside. He is extremely talented, with looks most men would envy. He and Ash hit it off immediately, finding they are mutually attracted. A relationship takes off immediately, leading up to Ash traveling with the band on their tour of the US. The only thing in their way is her secret... for how can she tell him she is immortal, requiring blood to survive, and dying every morning as the sun comes up?<br /><br />Just when things seem to be going so well, trouble appears. It turns out Zariaz, whom was thought to be destroyed a very long time ago by the Dark Council, is in fact very much alive and tracking Ash. She wants revenge, but she also needs Ash's help to complete the curse that will make Zar the strongest vampire in existence. Zar must drink from 1000 musicians to gain the abilities to write the song which will ensure her power forever. And it looks like Liam and Darkside have been marked for death. Can Liam and Ash's love overpower the evil insanity of Zar? Will she be defeated before her plans are fulfilled?<br /><br />Ms. Wilson has quite an intriguing story here. One will find everything from voodoo curses and \\"zombies\\" to love and adventure... and don't forget the vampire cat! Who else would have thought of working music into a vampire legend? The story flows effortlessly, with a surprising plot twist at the end, and the reader will not be able to put it down. This reviewer had to force herself not to read it while supposedly working, so engrossed was she. The romance between Ash and Liam is fantastic, made more complex by the secrets she must keep, and the very real threat Zar poses. The vampire rules present in this story are slightly different from the traditional, made original by the author's imagination.<br /><br />Ashara and Liam are very real people, with strengths and weaknesses like everyone. They are portrayed so vividly that one will be able to imagine meeting them on a dark street some night, or in a loud night club. Zar is wickedly malevolent, feared by her enemies, and her sister, while respected and possibly even loved by her henchmen. There are plenty of secondary characters as well, also beautifully depicted, right down to Lovecraft, Ash's Siamese cat.<br /><br />If one wants to read a refreshingly original vampire romance, this is the book to read. There is plenty to keep one interested and dying for the resolution. Also of note, the story ends in such a way to keep this reviewer gasping in surprise, eager to read the next chapter in the story, which hopefully Ms. Wilson will provide. Be sure to run to the computer and order a copy today, it will not disappoint.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, January 2004. All rights reserved.very real threat Zar poses.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />What would happen if an ancient virus were accidentally released in today's society? It would wipe out life as we know it, changing the world. This book tells the story of \\"What if?\\"<br /><br />A group of archeology students from the University of Texas are in Uxmal, Mexico, about to make the biggest find of the century. What they don't realize is that it will be the end of them as well. In the opening of the tomb of an ancient Maya king, they realize a deadly virus, the very one which killed the Maya culture over a millennia ago. The virus quickly wipes out the entire excavation party, and starts to spread; affecting everyone they came in contact with.<br /><br />What the team unwittingly released is the deadliest disease to ever affect mankind. Now a team of experts comes in to try to find the cure for the virus, before it wipes out the entire state of Texas, and eventually the world. While one group is in Texas, trying to attack the disease at the place of its outbreak, another group is in Mexico. For they had found a Mayan glyph, which identifies what is presently called the \\"Austin virus.\\" Therefore, if they identified the cause, maybe they found a cure as well.<br /><br />This book is full of adventure, mystery, suspense, and even a little bit of romance mixed in. An eclectic cast of characters takes part in finding the cure. There is Dr. Gary Spender, is running the operation from Texas, where he is trying to get a handle on the outbreak. Then there are Dr. Robert Ashley and Dr. Teresa Welles, who are racing through Mexico, trying to find the Maya record of the \\"Black Tongue\\" disease, and hopefully their cure as well.  But those are not the only players in the drama. One will also find drug smuggling, tax fraud, and dirty cops.<br /><br />This is a story that packs a full punch, dragging the reader in, capturing them in the intricate plot. This reviewer started the book with doubts as to whether or not she'd enjoy this book. Surprisingly enough, 10 pages into it, one becomes engrossed, finding every spare minute available to see what will happen next. Mr. Baxter does a remarkable job of portraying the tension and the emotional roller coasters the characters are riding. One will gasp with dismay, scream at the irony of the characters finding what they have long searched, only to possibly lose it all if the cure is not found.<br />This is one book definitely worth the time to indulge in it. This reviewer was engrossed and impressed with the talent imbued in this book. One will be eagerly anticipating his next novel.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, November 2003.

Courtesy of Love Romances Reviews<br /><br />As always, and with The Romantic, Madeline Hunter delivers an emotional love story full of realistic characters and plenty of plot to keep one reading to the end.<br /><br />Penelope, \\"Pen,\\" the Countess of Glasbury has been running from her depraved husband for many years. Unable to get a divorce as society would scorn her forever, and also because her husband refuses, she managed to at least escape his household, if not his name. But after avoiding England and his far reach as long as she had, time has run out and she must return home, hoping to get assistance from her beloved family and the one man who has always been there for her.<br /><br />Julian Hampton has been the solicitor for Pen's family since finishing the university. He has ever been there for the family, including Pen. If not for Julian, she would not have gotten the escape she did manage from her husband. He often played his cards close to the vest, but his biggest secret of all was held so tightly no one had even a hint of the depth of passion he felt for the woman who stole his heart when they were both children.<br /><br />Now a new threat has come to Pen from her husband, and this time she fears he may finally get his way and be able to hold on to her for the rest of his life. Who else would she turn to so as to avoid the depraved lifestyle of her husband Glasbury, but the one man who has ever been her champion? Will Julian's love finally have a chance to come to fruition? And what of her marriage? Can she escape once and for all?<br /><br />Ms. Hunter has proven her immense talent for passionate stories that suck readers in with this story. Perhaps the most anticipated book in the series, The Romantic is guaranteed to live up to the expectations. Julian has been such a mysterious character throughout the series that his was certainly this reviewer's favorite character, and his story is as deep and emotional as the man himself. He has always been the dutiful one, never wavering in his course, keeping his secrets to himself.<br /><br />Pen has been a delightful character throughout as well, and possesses a strength unsurpassed by many heroines in today's romance novels. The horrors she experienced in her marriage hardened her in some ways, yet in some ways she never lost that youthful innocence. She has her flaws, one of the biggest being her inability to see what was right in front of her, in the guise of Julian, for so long. She has grown so much throughout the series and here in her own tale, that she is a force to be reckoned with when she sets her mind to something.<br /><br />When simmering passion finally is released and both Julian and Pen give in to their feelings for each other, the heat in their encounters will ignite passion in the reader as well. They are meant to be together, and have always been; though sometimes it was hard to see. This reviewer admits to having had doubts as to how their story would be resolved, and if it would be done in a way that they both deserved. She has never been a fan of the heroine being married to one person and carrying on a relationship with another, so was worried how it would be resolved here. Ms. Hunter handled this facet of the story in such a good way that readers can't possibly doubt the outcome. Our lead characters here deserved a story as strong and deep as they are, and this book fulfills that completely.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, December 2004.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />This kick-off book in the new Bombshell line will satisfy readers in many ways.<br /><br />Kai Alseoun has led a hard life. Her father had been an alcoholic, who killed himself and her mother in a car accident many years ago. Just when she had found a life she was happy with, as a Navy combat pilot, it's all torn away from her by a betrayal from a fellow military man. She retreats to the reservation where she grew up with her Grandmother, and begins to realize there is another path meant for her, a life that comes to her through her vision dreams.<br /><br />Three sacred crystal totems are stolen from the Cherokee people and only Kai holds the key to finding them again. Her quest leads her to the heart of the Australian desert, in order to recover the first of the three objects. When an old friend is found to be her partner on this mission, Jake Stands Alone Carter, old feelings come rushing back to her - feelings of safety and security and, could it be... love? But she is emotionally scarred from past experiences. Will Jake's strength be enough to help her complete her mission, and heal the wounds of her heart once and for all?<br /><br />This was a good romance story, with enough action to keep most readers eager to share the adventure. Danger is around every corner for Kai and Jake, and will keep readers anticipating what is next to come. However, there were a few parts that dragged, in between the action scenes, and can take one longer to get through those sections of the story. For the most part though, this story does move steadily and details are revealed as the quest continues, making the villains seem all the more ominous as a result.<br /><br />There is quite a bit of information scattered throughout the story as well, which will delight readers whom are fascinated by Native American religions and beliefs. Ms. McKenna quite obviously did her homework, researching rituals and powers held by those most revered of the Cherokee people, their Medicine Women... and Men. This reviewer was captivated by the bit of knowledge used in the story to give it depth, and could actually feel the power flowing through the sacred totem and the medicine people of the Cherokee and the native Australians.<br /><br />Though the primary focus of the Bombshell series is on the strong female leads and their adventures, there is plenty of romance in this book. Correction... it reads more as a love story then a romance, but will please fans of the genre. Kai is a wounded soul, scarred by her past experiences with her emotionally abusive alcoholic father, her ex-lover who could not handle her strength of character and mind, and the man who cost her a military career. Though she and Jake have a past between them, where Jake was always her \\"savior\\" of sorts, due to her other experiences with men, she finds it very hard to trust him when he reappears in her life again after so many years. Jake understands her though, and how he deals with her fears will make readers fall in love with him for his kind and loving nature. When the two finally conquer Kai's doubts, and come to the end of their quest, readers will cheer them on to their much-deserved happy ending.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, October 2004.

US	52934870	R32T0FLFZIX0RE	1586086790	624252644	Dark And Dangerous	Books	4	9	9	N	N	An intense passionate collection of "dark" paranormal erotica	Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />This collection of stories is sure to entice the most selective of readers to venture to \\"the dark side\\" of romance and erotica in their books.<br /><br />In Beauty Ravished, by Celeste Anwar, Cherry Roman has taken what little savings she has, after being laid off at work, and splurged on a vacation adventure that she hopes will help her relax and enjoy life; not worry about what happens next. When she arrives at her haven, she finds that strangely enough, there seems to be no women present and the manager of the resort is happy about her being there. Neither can deny the eruption of passion they experience upon meeting, and Cherry is in for the shock of her life when she discovers just what kind of man, or is it beast?, Nigel Francoeur is.<br /><br />What a hot tale! Cherry and Nigel are immediately attracted to one another, their passion for one another a conflagration that is sure to singe the fingers of the reader. Ms. Anwar takes the world of the werewolves and shifts things around just a bit to satisfy her story and her readers. The descriptions of the behavior of the male werewolves show the animal instincts often lacking in shape shifter characters. The details of the mating game being played out in this story are well done, making one shiver in fear, or desire, at the concept and the events unfolding.<br /><br />In Dream Shadows by Angelica Hart, the next foray into the dark side, readers meet Violet Haze, born of the sun caste, who has been trained to be a willing wife to some lord lucky enough to win her in the nuptial auction. She longs to be free to enjoy the life she so desires, and to use her magic to keep the Light strong. She prays that it will not be one of the Dark lords who feed on fear that wins her. During much of her life she has experienced such intense erotic dreams that she finds some escape from her unhappy life. However, when she meets the man from her dreams, how can she be sure he is of the Light and not of the Dark?<br /><br />Violet is full of spirit and fire that reveals itself on every page and in every encounter. This reviewer laughed aloud at her antics to try and avoid being bought and mated at the nuptial auction. Her confusion is real when she is confronted with both Darth and Ash, and has to figure out who is the evil one and who is her savior. The electricity between she and Ash, both in dream and waking states, crackles with energy, burning them from the inside out, and will wreak havoc on the reader as well.<br /><br />In Blackthorne's Light by Marie Harte, Trey Blackthorne is a vampire born of humans, whose duty in life is to rid the world of people with evil souls. His is an empty life, with no satisfaction for him, and he hopes to some day find what he needs and desires. Adara Vansant is a reporter for a racy women's magazine who is doing a series of articles on \\"bad girls\\" and their adventures in the dark and erotic sex scene. When she visits a nightclub, Vampland, which caters to this crowd, she never expects the erotic attraction to owner, Trey. But is he her sensual salvation or her worst nightmare?<br /><br />This reviewer thoroughly enjoyed the slight twist on vampire lore found here. Trey was portrayed in a new light from what is ordinarily found in vampire tales. One is bound to empathize with him in his lonely and empty existence. When Adara comes into his life, the change in him is brilliant to experience, and the love they feel for one another is easily felt and understood. The plot is well thought out and flows smoothly, and will satisfy even the pickiest of readers.<br /><br />In The Dark One by Goldie McBride, Samantha Lancaster heads to Europe for a tour of reputedly haunted locations, a trip she had planned to take with her mother, until she died in a car crash on the way to the airport for this very trip. She ends her travels at the Chateaux du Beauchamp in France and gets more then she bargained for upon arrival. Gerard, Count du Beauchamp was a powerful warlock in his day, cursed by fate to spend eternity neither living nor dead. When he meets Samantha, he finds out that not only can she see him and talk to him, but that she may be the very answer to his desires, and only she can break the curse he's lived with for centuries.<br /><br />What collection of dark tales would be complete without a sexy ghost (or is he?) warlock? The story behind Gerard's existence is complex and developed quite thoroughly, giving enough information to make readers understand his predicament. Samantha's background is also intricate, making one feel for her and why she is so drawn to this particular site on her tour. These two characters are meant to be together, and the story proves that without a doubt. Their feelings for one another won't be denied and how their romance in concluded will make readers be thrilled for them.<br /><br />It is hard to pick a favorite story out of this collection. Every one is delightful and will enthrall readers. They are all equally sensual, written so well that the passion leaps from every story to captivate and inspire readers. Be sure to have a cold shower, or a warm and willing partner, readily available upon finishing this collection of erotic fantasies.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, October 2004.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />He came to her in the night, a misty dream of seduction.<br /><br />Heather Kincaid was a young girl in high school when her date hit a man with his car. She insisted they help, and only got abandoned on the dark road in the forest for her troubles. She saw something that night as she helped the injured man that would haunt her forever; to the point she thought she was insane. Repeated dreams about the mystery man only convinced her of it, making her swear to stay away from that place forever. Many years later, when her parents died, she returned to that place to settle her parents' affairs. Lo and behold she sees that man again when she arrives, and every night thereafter.<br /><br />Devin MacAvoy has lived for centuries, never allowing himself to care about a human again, after a disastrous relationship hundreds of years ago. From the moment he sees her that fateful night several years ago, something about Heather draws him that he can't explain, making him want to break his vow to himself. So he waited, until she returned once again. When she did, he was surprised to find their bond every bit as strong as it was then. No matter how attached he is to her though, she can't ever know his secret, for he fears she will spurn him forever if she does.<br /><br />Heather has never forgotten Devin, though she had finally convinced herself he was a figment of her overactive imagination. Finding out he was real, shocked her to no end, making her desire to be with him all the more. Devin knows Heather is the only woman for him and longs to be with her. But his secret holds him back. His has a life of secrets and mystery, for he is not human, but a form of vampire, and none can know the truth of his kind, for it almost killed him long ago. He wants to tell her the truth, but can she handle it? So he tries to win her affection in other ways.<br /><br />His plans go awry though when one of his previous \\"donors\\" becomes obsessed with him. She is stalking him, and she begins to go after Heather, for she wants no one to be with him but herself. When her obsession gets dangerous, he must learn to have faith in Heather, trust that her love for him will see her through the shock of discovering his secret. If she can't then he'd rather die, for he too has grown attached to Heather. Dare he say it, he's fallen in love.<br /><br />This was a fascinating book, with a slightly different kind of vampire for a hero. Devin is strong, yet fragile as well. His abilities make him powerful, but the even stronger power of love brings him to his knees. Heather is a fine match for Devin in that she has the strength and courage to stand up under the unbelievable facts of his kind. She is strong where he needs it, as he is where she needs it. They are in balance with each other.<br /><br />This book is not an action packed one, though it has plenty to keep one interested. There is also a nice thread in the story, where Heather experiences the life of another young lady from centuries ago through her dreams. This adds to the tension in the plotline while she tries to figure out these strange dreams of hers, and why she is having them. It also adds some extra emotion as well, for the reader feels the poor girl's suffering through Heather.<br /><br />Ms. Carter has woven a world here that could have been \\"cookie-cutter\\" if not for her different take on the vampire theme.

Courtesy of Love Romances Reviews<br /><br />Caitlyn McKenna continues her compelling gothic saga in Descent of Demons, the second book in the trilogy.<br /><br />This story begins where Echoes of Angels left off, with Julienne Blackthorne thought dead and her lover Morgan Saint-Evanston chasing after his nemesis, Xavier D'Shagre. Julienne had been abandoned and though near death, with a dreadful daemon coming to life within her chest, she had an incredible will to live and find Morgan, her only hope of survival in the harsh world of Sclyd.<br /><br />Morgan had always scorned his birthright, turning his back on his magickal half after the death which caused the burning hatred between he and Xavier to be born. He believes Julienne is lost and cannot forgive himself for the tragic end which became her. Now he awakens his powers once more, knowing he'll need them in the coming battle which could spell the end of his world.<br /><br />Xavier has found the key to using the greatest of all magickal forces, and hopes to unlock the secrets of the Scrolls of Cachaen to claim that untold power, to regenerate himself, and to gain control of all three worlds: that of humans, that of Sclyd, and that of the spirit realm. Morgan and Julienne must find each other before it's too late, and use his powers and hers- soon- to- be- gained, to defeat Xavier and prevent the hell he intends to unleash. Time is against Julienne and Morgan, but will they achieve success before it is too late?<br /><br />Once again, Ms. McKenna welcomes readers into the world of her imagination, where magick reigns, both good and ill. She has created such vivid imagery that readers will be drawn into the scenery, from the beautiful forests of Danarra, to the twisted realm of the Cult of Ouroborous (the Dragon), to the underground caverns of Erabris.

Courtesy of The Best Reviews<br /><br />This book is sure to draw the readers in from the beginning, with plenty of mystery, suspense, and of course, a healthy dose of romance.<br /><br />Alexandra Watson has special abilities. She is able to sense people's emotions and she also has been known to \\"see\\" events before they happen. She is an American, headed to London after her father's death, to live as ward to one of his old friends. She is less than pleased with her new living arrangements and would like nothing more then to be able to stay in her own home, with her companion and friend, Flora Cormack. She is infuriated over the presumptuousness of her new guardian, Ross Havenwood, in taking over governing her life, and she intends to tell him so, as soon as she sees him again. Her tender feelings for him that he has carried since she last saw him 10 years previous are not enough to save him from her anger.<br /><br />Much has happened in Ross' life since he last saw Alexandra - he has been married and widowed, in quite a scandalous affair that he is still reeling from. Gone is the happy-go-lucky, romantic soul that he once was, for he has become disillusioned and has lost in faith in people. Yet he remembers the young girl from 10 years past, and the idyllic time he spent visiting her and her late father. When Alexandra arrives at his London home, he is unprepared for the fiery beauty she has become. Shockingly enough, he finds that tender emotion, which he though long -buried, has come trickling to the surface again, though he is not yet willing to lose the cynical view of life he has adopted.<br /><br />Alexandra and Ross clash from the first moment she arrives, full of indignation over his handling of her affairs, and the distant man he has become. Until her gift comes crashing forth, in the form of disturbing dreams. A madman is loose in London's East End, killing prostitutes and mangling their bodies and Alexandra begins to dream about the murders. Except in her dreams, she is the woman being brutally slain, and she feels all of their abject fear, and the intense pain he inflicts on them. She is afraid to tell Ross about her dreams, for fear he will mock her for them. What she doesn't realize is, he suffers the same dreams, and upon their discovery of their mutual nightmares, they must team up to try to help solve the grisly murders, before a young friend of theirs becomes the murderer's next victim. All the while battling their night demons, they find themselves unable to resist the allure of their attraction for one another, and the fact they may have found their soul mates in each other.<br /><br />Ms. Agnew has written a compelling story here. Alexandra and Ross are a perfect couple, overcoming great odds to find the love they both long for. Alexandra is a strong heroine, having had to hide her abilities, or be scorned for them, yet she has never lost the innocence in her heart, even having seen the darker side of life through her visions. Ross is a man beaten down by life, once happy and care-free, now cynical and distrusting in the good facets of life. Alexandra brings back the light to his world, dispelling the clouds that have been looming over him ever since his disastrous marriage. There is also a delightful secondary romance as well, which adds to the story rather then detracting from it.<br /><br />The dark underside of London life is the main focus of the mystery and horror, which makes up a large part of the plot in this book. The history of \\"Jack the Ripper\\" has fascinated people for over a century, in a twisted sort of way. So it was interesting to see Ms. Agnew's take on the whole sordid mystery that has never been solved. This book runs the gamut of reader emotions, keeping one engrossed all the way through to the end. One will feel sadness over Alexandra's father's death and the destruction of Ross' marriage, mental anguish as they suffer the consequences of their \\"gift\\" which often seems more like a curse. There is abject horror over the grisly killings and the terrible fear in the victims. Then, there is the elation when Ross and Alexandra finally \\"save the day\\" and give in to their desire to be together, bringing about the required happy ending for a romance. Everything is wrapped up nicely in a package sure to captivate the reader.<br /><br />This book is definitely recommended to anyone who loves a good romance that has plenty of action, and a touch of the paranormal thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

All she cares about is proving to her father she is capable of running his railroad company. Her sisters have all gone off and gotten married, but that was not the life for Meryl. She wanted to fill the role at her father's side normally reserved for a son of the family. She finally gets a chance to prove to her father she deserves his respect as a businesswoman when a crucial sale is close to reality, which would cement her father's business. But her father has other plans...<br /><br />Joseph Hammond was the son of Meryl's father's old friend and business partner, and had always looked up to Meryl's father. He had also been a special friend of Meryl all through their childhood. He has been working for her father for a few years and his heart was set on becoming president of the company. Just when it looked like his new position was in the bag, he gets a surprise. Meryl is all grown up, his childhood friend a child no more, and she has plans for that position as well.<br /><br />What follows is something neither had anticipated. They make a wager... whoever can seal the deal in California for her father on the pending sale, would become the new president of the Carrington railroad empire. But as they are racing across the country, yet another surprise... they find that their formally friendly feelings for each other have grown into something more, something both were hesitant about but eager to see where it would lead. Will they sit competition aside for the sake of their newly discovered love? Or will the contest drive a wedge between them for good?<br /><br />This was a good tale, but not quite as captivating as other books in the American Heiress series. This reviewer was not at all fond of Joseph in the beginning of the story. He came across as a selfish man who cared for nothing but his own success. Granted, the real motivation for his behavior was explained in detail later on in the story, redeeming him. But this reviewer could not get past her initial opinion of him. Meryl was a delight, however, her whole world being her family, her father, and his business. All she wanted was to make him happy and prove to him she was capable of running his empire.<br /><br />The story in itself was appealing though. The bulk of the story was following Meryl and Joseph from New York to San Francisco. Their journey was full of excitement and adventure. The tricks Meryl and Joseph kept playing on each other were often amusing, always keeping the reader waiting to see what they would do next.<br /><br />The desire between Joseph and Meryl was always smoldering under the surface, though they kept trying to deny their mutual attraction. When they finally give in to their passion, it consumes them both. Readers will enjoy this tale, holding their breath as they wait to see who will win the challenge. Also, one will love the fact that Meryl is a strong woman, full of fire, and extremely intelligent. This reviewer always loves to see a strong female lead who will do whatever it takes to prove herself, all the while never losing her femininity.<br /><br />This story is well worth the time to read, in spite of the less then impressive Joseph in the beginning of the story.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

All she cares about is her charity work and putting her family's money to use in a more fulfilling way. She intends to never marry, devoting all her time and energy to making a difference instead. Well, until he arrives on her family's doorstep.<br /><br />Captain Stone Hawke, formerly of the British Army, has just arrived in New York City, from India. He arrives at the Carrington house, directed there by one of Clara's older sisters. He is suffering in body... and mind, as a result of his tour of duty in India, and a tragedy he believes was his fault. All he wants is a peaceful place to recover from his illness and remember the reason he is in New York, and not still in India.<br /><br />Clara immediately adopts Stone as one of her \\"causes,\\" hoping to help him recover his health and spirits. She goes out of her way to make him feel better and to try to convince him life is a wonderful thing, deserving of happiness, not misery. She does not understand the ghosts he lives with, that have turned him into the unhappy man he is. Neither one expects the immediate attraction they feel, or the desire to know one another inside and out. However, Stone is convinced he is undeserving of the angel Clara is, believing she would turn her back on him if she knew the truth of his discharge from the Army. Can Clara get through to his stone-cold heart? Will Stone ever accept what happened and feel joy in life again?<br /><br />This was the reviewer's first book by Ms. Cozzens, but not the last. She writes with flare about the high society life of New York City in the 1800s, where the rules of Regency England still apply, even though the social classes are based on wealth rather then title. One gets a colorful view of that world, including the glamorous world, and the darker side of big city life during the times.<br /><br />Clara is a pleasant young lady, always happy and never letting anything get her down. Her cheerful disposition pleases Stone at the same time it grates on his nerves. As much as he likes the fact there are people out there who care about others, he is concerned that her naivet&eacute;, as he sees it, will only get her into trouble. Stone is a damaged man, not able to get past the events that destroyed his unit, or his role in it, as unintentional as it was. He needs Clara's brightness to counter the darkness he feels inside over his losses. When their relationship blossoms into a great love, the reader will cheer along, crying through the tears brought on by the agony Stone feels.<br /><br />This story is one of character growth, more so then action. Granted, there are plenty of things going on to keep the reader interested and reading through to the end, but it is Clara and Stone's bond that really holds one absorbed all the way to the requisite happy ending. This story will also make the reader want to go out and find the rest of the books in this series about the Carrington sisters, eager to spend more time with this wonderful family.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

She moved to Erie, PA, pregnant and alone at the age of 19, when she believed Aaron's father did not want children and she believed she was not good enough for him. She made a new life for herself and Aaron, where she could overcome the stigma of being the daughter of the town drunk and be known for who she was on the inside. She was relatively happy until the day he walked into her store.<br /><br />Joe Delacamp had just accepted a job in the ER of the Erie Hospital, moving from his home town in Georgia. He and the one woman he ever loved had had a dream of moving to the shores of Lake Erie to create their perfect life... together. Even though she had abandoned him, he had never forgotten her, or their dream. So imagine his surprise when he walks in to the chocolate store on Perry Square and sees her. If he was surprised to see Louisa, he was shaken to the core to see her son, staring back at him with his own eyes, the spitting image of himself as a child.<br /><br />Louisa never expected to see Joe again, believing he had gotten engaged to another woman, and thinking it best for him to never know he had a son. Joe had spent the past eight years of his life thinking she had stopped loving him... that she left him of her own design. He may have missed the first seven years of Aaron's life, but he vowed to never miss another moment. So Joe and Louisa come to a grudging compromise, for the sake of their son.<br /><br />Neither Louisa nor Joe had ever stopped loving each other, though both are in denial that love exists still to this day. Unfortunately, eight years was a long time to be apart, much having happened in the interim, and both having changed quite a bit. There are many secrets between them, the biggest being Louisa's real reason for abandoning Joe, and numerous misunderstandings that interfere with how they feel about each other. Can they overcome their past history and insecurities to be together as they were meant to be?<br /><br />Another winner for Ms. Jacobs! This reviewer has yet to be disappointed by any of her stories. She has a talent for taking a common plot, twisting and turning it around with her words, until it turns out to be a unique storyline, full of everything that is characteristic of her books. Louisa and Joe are complex characters, full of flaws, but still charming and loveable. Both are dedicated to making the best life for Aaron, no matter what sacrifices they themselves have to make along the way. Both have so much love to share that it flows out of them in waves, making the reader feel for their plight and praying for them to get the happiness they long for.<br /><br />The secondary characters are enchanting as well, from Elmer, Louisa's dearest friend, and the only father figure Aaron had known until now, to the hilarious town busybody, Pearly Gates with her rather unique stories, and her friends. Fans who have read the other Perry Square books, will be happy to visit with all of their favorite characters from the series.<br /><br />Of course, Dad Today, Groom Tomorrow is chock full of the humor never lacking in Ms. Jacobs stories, probably one of the key elements she is known for. There are plenty of funny moments throughout, one of this reviewer's favorites being the \\"chocolate skating\\" scene. What does that phrase mean? Well one will just have to read the book to find out, and it is well worth it. It is not possible to be disappointed by this yarn.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, May 2003.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />Ms. Feehan proves once again she can tackle whatever she sets her mind to, with ease. Readers will love this latest foray into the wilds of the rainforest, where secrets are revealed and another breed of people live.<br /><br />Rachael Lospostos is on the run. Someone wants her dead and will do anything to make sure it happens. She travels to the rainforest with a missionary group bringing medical supplies to the villages. She hopes to lose herself there, making everyone believe she is dead. Once arriving, something about the rainforest calls to her, making her feel like she is home, and she hopes to be able to live there a while after making her escape. She never expects the secrets that will be revealed to her upon arriving.<br /><br />Rio lives in the rainforest, and has for his entire life. No other place could ever give him the feeling of freedom or security that it provides. It also allows for him to explore his other self, the wild and untamed part of him that is his heritage - he is one of a dying kind, the leopard people, able to shift shape into that of a wildcat. His lives alone, with only his leopard companions for company, except for the times his duty to the others of the forest call to him. He is a tracker, one of the best, who makes a living by rescuing kidnap victims from the bandits who run so rampant along the river. Though he is content, he is not happy, never able to forget why he lives this way... until the day she appears.<br /><br />When Rachael finally makes her escape from the mission folk, she comes upon a hut high in the trees, nearly invisible, and takes refuge there, not knowing she enters the lair of one who will change her life forever. Rio comes upon her and attacks, believing she has been sent to kill him, for the most ruthless of the bandits, Tomas, wants him dead. After she is subdued by his leopard companions, he finds she is not after him and in fact, finds out she is also a wanted woman.<br /><br />Several days of forced confinement, as Rachael's injuries slowly heal bring her and Rio into close contact, and they find they are drawn to each other in a way neither can explain. Also, Rachael senses a new restless feeling that she can't understand. As they grow closer, Rio worries how she will react when she discovers the secret of his other self, for he knows she is the only woman for him. However, before they can truly explore their growing passion, they must find those who want Rachel dead and defeat them, or she will never truly be free.<br /><br />Ms. Feehan explores further the leopard people first introduced in her novella, \\"The Awakening,\\" in the anthology Fantasy. She manages to explore the world of this unique race so fully, that the reader can't help but feel a part of it. There is no end to the adventure found here either, for the rainforest is a dangerous place at best and deadly at worst. Add in some bandits, drug dealers, poachers, and just the regular risks found in the jungle and there is plenty to keep readers engrossed and interested.<br /><br />Rio and Rachael are an enchanting pair, whose passion cannot be denied. Their romance takes off, becoming even steamier then the humid jungle air. The descriptions of the shapeshifting are so well done, and with such a sensuous feel to them, that one sees the transformation vividly, fascinated by the possibility. For who wouldn't want to have such an incredible ability? To feel things as a human would, as well as have the perceptiveness and stealth of a mighty jungle cat?<br /><br />There is also an underlying tension to the tale, wrought with emotion the reader gets to experience, in regards to Rio's relationship with the others of his kind, and that of Rachael and her brother. These facets of the story are explored quite fully as well, through the interactions of all of the players. The other characters of the novel are drawn so clearly, that one can feel the respect, love, or malice behind their actions. As always, Ms. Feehan hints at future stories to come, possibly involving those introduced here. Have no fear, readers, her talent is ever growing, far from becoming stale, and more adventures are sure to follow.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, December 2003.

He recently found his lifemate, Diana, an Adept, who is a very rare member of the Balance that is able to practice all kinds of magick.<br /><br />When a Healer Apprentice, Carla, disrupts the Balance by being kidnapped out of the Ocean Magick stronghold in Rhode Island, and horribly abused, Win is selected to be the temporary Guardian there, as the old one failed at protecting everyone. His first tasks are to find Carla and bring her home safely, and to strengthen the protection on the stronghold so that can't happen again. Diana's Sight dreams assist in finding Carla, though they aren't able to determine who the abductor is... until later.<br /><br />While Win is learning his new job as Guardian, finally reaching his dreams, Diana is adjusting to life in the Balance, still refusing to worship Goddess because She forced Diana into a very unhappy life growing up, reason being that Diana needed that to learn strength and fully appreciate her gifts and accept the Balance. Win and Diana are also still learning to grow together as lifemates, their conflicting views causing much tension between them, on the brink of tearing them apart.<br /><br />When Sulis, Win's sister is drawn into the web of the man who abducted Carla, destroying her mind in the process, Win and Diana must put their differences regarding Goddess aside so as to rescue Su from the evil man who has her. Diana must also come to terms with her feelings and decide once and for all if she will dedicate her life to Goddess and the Balance.<br /><br />This tale is first and foremost a love story, the continuation of Win and Diana's growth as a couple and their love for one another and their acceptance of each others' beliefs and dreams. The characters, not just these two, but all of them, are skillfully rendered and fully developed. One learns what makes them be whom they are, focusing on back-story just enough to understand their reasons for being as they are.<br /><br />There is plenty of plot to be found, the character driven storyline of Win and Diana's relationship, as well as the action driven plot surrounding Carla's kidnapping and resulting trauma, and Su's relationship with the villain. Magick, of course, is a key element in all the plotlines, in the form of a good vs. evil struggle with a twist.<br /><br />Ms. Taffs once again lovingly creates the Realm of the Balance, showing her attention to detail and her vivid imagination by crafting a world of magick, love, and beauty, that the reader can't help but be drawn into, never wanting to leave. This reviewer loved her second visit to the Balance, hoping there will be more books from the pen of Mary Taffs, and future visits to such an incredible world. This story will convince the reader that More than Magick can be found everywhere, if only one looks for it.<br /><br />The reader will be captured for the very first gripping scene, vivid and detailed, and not let go until the end, riding through a roller coaster of adventure and love, all the way to the incredible climax. One does not have to read the prequel, Magick, to follow the story, but it will fill in some of the recent history leading to events happening here, making this story all the more intriguing.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

One does not have to read the prequel, Magick, to follow the story, but it will fill in some of the recent history leading to events happening here, making this story all the more intriguing.    © Kelley A.

Her mother desires her to marry into a high ranking reputable family and Amelia's father is eager for the business connections this marriage will open up to him in Europe. All she wants is to be happy and to find a marriage of love rather then convenience.<br /><br />Jack Kent is attending the high society wedding of the wealthy socialite from America and her groom-to-be Duke Whitcliffe, for an opportunity to spend time with his family before heading off on another sea journey. When he escapes the Church to go outside for some air prior to the wedding, she is shocked to see the young bride making a break for freedom by shimmying out a Church window and down the wall, on a beeline for a carriage to escape in, and ends up in Jack's own carriage!<br /><br />Jack is immediately taken with Amelia's spirit and bid for freedom, agreeing to help her by taking her first to London, then on to his home in Inverness, Scotland. Suddenly he finds himself protecting the young beauty, wanting to see no harm come to her as she discovers how it feels to be free. Jack and Amelia are drawn to each other... he to her indomitable will and she to the kindness in his heart, which can't quite mask the pain in his eyes - a pain he refuses to reveal.<br /><br />However, fate is not ready for them yet. Someone has plans to ruin Jack's growing shipping business, destroying any credibility he's acquired by overcoming his less-then-stellar past. Amelia's family will do anything to get her back and married off. Will Jack and Amelia be able to overcome the obstacles - internal and external - to find the happiness only they can grant each other?<br /><br />Ms. Monk continues the Kent family saga with this impressive read. Jack and Amelia show such passion and strength, still having their weaknesses, as the reader gets to know them. Jack is convinced everyone looks down on him for his scandalous past and Amelia longs for someone to love her for herself, not her money. Each longs for the other to love them for whom they are inside, not what is on the surface. All of the secondary characters are delightful as well... from Jack's extended family of reformed thieves to Amelia's brash family of \\"loud obnoxious\\" Americans.<br /><br />Plenty of plot can be found in Jack's lowly background, Amelia's escapades to escape for The Wedding Escape, and the mystery behind the vandalism to his sea fleet and the attempts to destroy his business. Jack's brothers and sisters... and servants... add humor to the story, keeping it lighthearted and full of entertaining and memorable scenes.<br /><br />One can't help but fall in love with Jack and Amelia, and all of the Kent family throughout this entire book.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />Ms. Jackson has a winner with this novel. This is a thought-inducing story, which will make one wonder about the possibility of reincarnation.<br /><br />Domitien had loved and lost, centuries ago, when his wife and unborn child were brutally slain. He was so heartbroken in that life that he vowed he would never again know love, no matter how many eternities or lives he experienced. What he doesn't realize is that after so many lives of refusing to acknowledge love, he was facing his last hope. If he did not let go of his ancient hatred and vow against love, his soul would be destroyed and he'd never have another chance.<br /><br />The Creator has plans for Dom though, hoping that this time, in this life, he will finally create the perfect woman for Dom, with whom he could not help but fall in love. For He has taken all of the best characteristics of her past incarnations, those that most intrigued Dom, and combined them in to one woman, Laris, who he imagined even Dom couldn't resist. Laris was a great beauty, ethereally so, with red hair, luminous skin, and a voice even angels would long to have. But was that enough?<br /><br />When first Laris and Dom meet, in her dreams, she is unable to resist his allure, and even Dom was drawn into the fantasies. When they meet in person for the first time, nothing could keep them apart. Until an ancient enemy enters their lives, the same enemy who has followed them through all their lives... Rychard. Rychard's goal is to destroy them both, as it has always been. The only way to escape for Laris and Dom is to cross through Death's door, literally, and then the real journey begins. They travel through many of Dom's past lives, The Creator's hope being that they will learn the lessons that have eluded them, and bring them together for all eternity. Will Dom learn once again to love? Or will Laris fail and the two of them be separated forever?<br /><br />WOW! This book was absolutely incredible. Ms. Jackson has it all here - eternal love, ancient vows, truly evil enemies, adventures like one could never imagine. The reader will be drawn into the story from the very first page, the very first life Dom and Laris share, the one that sets the tone for all to follow. The emotion in this story is high, making one laugh, cry, and rage at Lady Fate, right alongside the main characters.<br /><br />The passion between Laris and Dom is electrifying, as it had been from their first life together, and the emotion between them is incredibly powerful. They have a love unlike any other, even if Dom refuses to acknowledge it, swearing to not feel anything at all. One hopes and prays they will find the answers necessary to the end of their sad journey, bringing them together as they should be.<br /><br />What's really interesting about this story is how Ms. Jackson weaves all the lives together seamlessly, through flashback type scenes at the beginning of each chapter. This is intriguing because it gives some glimpse of Dom (and Laris) and why they are in their present situation. There was one nice scene where the current life \\"bumped into\\" a past life and that added an extra dimension to the tale.<br /><br />This is truly an emotionally packed story that will have the reader continuing just as fast as possible, to see what will happen next, and what depth of emotion will be reached in the different chapters. Ms. Jackson has written a story that packs quite a wallop for the reader, proving why she is becoming a force to be reckoned with in the romance genre. Way to go Ms. Jackson; if this reviewer was not already a lifelong fan, this book would have made her one.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, November 2003.

One day while he is awaiting a comrade in arms in London's Beefsteak Club, he sees something which startles him. This thing he sees is a private thing, which has him worried about how it will affect his family. He is in a dilemma of trying to figure out what to do about this, so confides in a friend, who helps him think of ways to resolve the matter.<br /><br />However, his personal matters are put on hold when he is tasked by his King with a far more important duty, solving the murder of a fellow soldier, who quite possibly was a traitor and spy. As he begins to investigate this mystery, he finds there are some rather unusual circumstances which start to tie the two mysteries together. He begins to track down a mysterious woman in a green velvet dress who may provide many of the answers he seeks. Who is she and why is she connected to both mysteries?<br /><br />Ms. Gabaldon has written yet another intriguing story, which will keep the reader turning the pages to see what happens next. Fans of her Outlander series will be happy to see Lord John, one of the most favored secondary characters of her series starring in his own book, which shows the potential to be a series in and of itself. This mystery will take one from the very uppermost echelons of society to the \\"darkest\\" side of London night life in the 1750s.<br /><br />All of the characters are incredibly well-developed, in trademark Gabaldon style. The readers find out not just the most surficial personality traits, but their deepest secrets as well, by getting inside the minds of the players. However, maybe it was just this reviewer's other responsibilities interfering, but there were so many characters that she had difficulty keeping track of them all and what roles they played in the saga. Several times it was necessary to flip back through previous pages to try to find someone and why they are involved in the events playing out.<br /><br />Another trademark of Ms. Gabaldon's writing is her vast mastering of vocabulary, keeping things from getting mundane and boring in their repetitiveness. However, sometimes her use of `five dollar' words is distracting, especially when the reader's own mastery of language is not as extensive, causing one to either have to stop reading to look up terms used, or just keep reading, hoping to be able to still grasp the details being described and actions being played out.<br /><br />In spite of those couple concerns mentioned, this was an impressive story, keeping one engrossed, eager to find out the solution to both mysteries being investigated. There were enough plot twists to keep one guessing, and even a time or two stumping Lord John as well. The ending is surprising, not what was expected, but appealing nonetheless.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, November 2003.

A heart-wrenching story told from the Native American point of view, this will keep one engrossed through the end.<br /><br />Hiawatha Craft is in a bit of a dilemma. While waiting for his car to be fixed, he visits a local junk shop, and peruses their Cherokee artifacts. Something about them strikes a familiar cord though he can't for the life of him figure out why. After his car is functioning again, he ventures on his way to a nearby city known for its Cherokee history records, in the hopes of tracking down some of his ancestors. Much to his dismay, a tornado comes up out of nowhere, sucking him into itself and depositing him elsewhere, alive and uninjured, but over 150 years in the past!<br /><br />Valerie Redhook despairs of ever being happy again. Her family and their village have all been rounded up to head west, along the \\"Trail of Tears\\" to their new home. Her people have long suffered on this journey, falling ill faster then ever as winter approaches. All she longs for is to do her best to tend to those in need, and to prove to her father she is more than capable of becoming Chief someday. When a man in strange garments appears and is put in her wagon with her, she is unsure if he is the answer to their prayers, or the biggest danger yet to be faced.<br /><br />Hiawatha is in disbelief over his plight and his only thought is to find a way home to his own time. What follows surprises him. As he travels the Trail of Tears with the Cherokee he is amazed by the quiet strength of his people, and of Valerie herself. As with any long journey, this one is fraught with peril as they try to overcome their difficulties and find their destiny. He is drawn to Valerie the more he is with her, and soon faces his greatest fear yet. How will he leave this woman he has come to love when he must return to his own time?<br /><br />This was an interesting look at one of the most heartbreaking events of Native American history - The Trail of Tears. This period of history is one many wish they could forget ever happened, realizing that the government may not have been the wisest at the time. The reader experiences the hardships of the harrowing journey of the Cherokee from the only home they had ever known, to a new place they have not yet seen. Yet through it all, the illness, and lack of food, the deaths of many loved ones, and a long cold journey, the people never lost hope. They believed that at the end of the road they would find a new home they could love, even if it never replaced the home of their hearts. The reader will feel their pain and sorrow, and their joy of life throughout the whole tale, and will find oneself wishing not to know how things really played out for them, long term.<br /><br />Hiawatha and Valerie are strong characters. He has to overcome what happened, and find the purpose behind it, for he never doubts there was a reason such an extraordinary thing happened to him. Valerie suffers in silence, never complaining about her plight and the added responsibility now falling on her shoulders as Chief's daughter. She is proud of her people and her tribe, feeling the greatest thing that could happen to her would be to be chosen to lead them in their new life. Yet she deals with the traditional beliefs that a woman cannot lead, hoping to prove otherwise through her deeds. Hiawatha and Valerie are a good match, her quiet dignity the perfect compliment to his more modern views, as well as balancing his drive to return home, only for him to find out home is not what he thought at all.<br /><br />One thing this reviewer liked about the book was that there is not the traditional good vs. evil plot. This story was a saga of the life of the Native Americans on their journey west, so there is no particular \\"good\\" or \\"bad.\\" All of the characters were a complex blend, from Valerie's uncle, Charles, who is an embittered man, to little Sally Black Cloud, who shows the indomitable spirit of a child.<br /><br />What was also nice was that the Cherokee did not rail at their fate, crying about the injustice of it all. They kept their pride and as much of their old ways as they could, in spite of what was happening to them. Hiawatha too, does not allow himself to complain about what happened to him, he carries on, knowing he has a purpose, hoping he finds and fulfills it before he must leave.<br /><br />This was an excellent story, the first this reviewer has read by Ms. Troxel. It kept her interest and made her hope for more stories by this talented author. Hopefully, more will follow in the near future.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, December 2003.

As much as she dreads these kinds of events, she goes somewhat grudgingly, to help the boss. After a disastrous evening full of social faux pas, she escapes outdoors for a break. The last thing she expected was to get caught up in a murder investigation!<br /><br />Bobby Stark comes to Cathy for aid. His brother, Danny was arrested for arson and murder but he knows Danny is innocent. Bobby has found evidence and begs Cathy to assist him. But before he can reveal the hiding place of the proof of Danny's innocence, he is killed, right before her eyes, after only revealing one small piece of revelation for the whereabouts of his evidence. Now Cathy is caught up in a double mystery, both of which she suspects the missing proof will solve.<br /><br />Cathy turns to Peter Lowell, Danny's attorney, for assistance, especially when it appears the murderer now suspects Cathy of having the answers he seeks, and her life is at risk. Will they solve the mysteries and find the hidden evidence before it is too late?<br /><br />Wow! Ms. McCullough has penned a wonderful suspense with this book. There are several interesting plot threads to keep one guessing throughout. What is most interesting about this novel is that the real mystery is not who the killer is, but where the evidence is hidden. This becomes apparent when the reader figures out rather quickly, who the real villain is. However, the search for this information Bobby found winds through the entire story, making the reader want to solve the mystery. When the hiding place is revealed, the readers will be surprised, wondering why they didn't see it before.<br /><br />Primarily a mystery/suspense novel, there is however, enough romance to keep fans of that genre interested in reading on. A bond forms between Cathy and Peter that grows through all the danger they face until it bonds them tightly. Another interesting relationship, though not a romantic one, also develops between Cathy and Danny, who is a young boy on the verge of manhood, needing the guidance of a strong adult.<br /><br />This is a well-written story, full of detail and action that will keep one entranced from beginning to end, and wishing the story could go on forever. Ms. McCullough proves again that she is a rising star in the writing world, and this reviewer eagerly awaits her next work.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, March 2004.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />This book is a compelling continuation of the story of The Balance. Picking up where More Than Magick left off, the reader has answers to many questions raised at the end of that story.<br /><br />At last, Healer Sulis has her chance to shine. At the opening of the story, she is a broken down version of her former self, full of self-loathing and shame at her role in almost destroying her family and loved ones. She had betrayed her Goddess and her vows as a healer when she was under the control of the evil Janus. She believes nothing she could ever do would make up for her behavior and wishes for a life with the Daughters of the Goddess, a group of women dedicated to an existence of isolation and worship. Her family, and Goddess, have other plans however.<br /><br />Mage Llyr suffers in his own private hell as well. He can never forget what happened a couple years ago. California Magick, one of the strongholds of The Balance, was destroyed by the evil Shiva, priest of the Queen. He was no match for Shiva, though he is convinced he could have done more to stop him. Nor can he forget the one woman he had loved, and how he failed her most of all.<br /><br />When these two are thrown together for a special mission, neither is happy about the turn of events, preferring to continue their own chosen paths. However, their council of leaders has other plans. It turns out Bedrock is not dead at California Magick, as previously thought, but it is severely damaged and in need of healing. Su is best suited to the job, though she thinks otherwise, and Mage Llyr is chosen to assist and act as Guardian during the healing process. What Goddess wants, Goddess gets, after all, She knows best... and what she wants is for Sulis and Llyr to be bonded by old rituals, for better service to Her.<br /><br />Sulis and Llyr are at odds from the moment they meet - he is convinced she was a willing party to recent events to disrupt the Balance and allow evil to reign. Su is upset as she feels she is undeserving of the honor bestowed on her to fulfill this particular duty, one that has never before been attempted, and she only wishes to be left alone to her misery. These two find themselves drawn to one another as they never expected, finding the beginnings of a special love. Unfortunately, the evil ever dogging them is back, with a new plan for the permanent destruction of Bedrock and the Balance. Can Su and Llyr overcome their doubts in themselves, and each other to Heal Bedrock and win this battle? Or will the Queen's followers conquer in the end? One must read the book to be sure.  Throughout the story, the reader will see the growth of Sulis and Llyr, as they overcome the obstacles preventing them from being the best of which they are capable. As they grow and change, their mutual animosity turns to a grudging respect, then like, and finally, their love for one another reveals itself and shines through.<br /><br />Of course, action is never lacking in one of Ms. Taffs' stories. She expands on the traditional good vs. evil scenario with complex storylines that will capture the reader's interest. One will be eager to keep turning the pages, to find out what will happen next. The story text and dialogue flow smoothly, seamlessly, making the storyline easier to follow. There will be some confusion in some scenes though, where references are made to happenings from the previous two books, if one is starting with this book in the series. However, Ms. Taffs works hard to dispel that as well, by providing a glossary in the back of the book, defining the Balance for readers. There are also mentions made in the glossary of the references to the first two books, explaining them to people. This will certainly help to understand the full scope of the story encompassed in these books.<br /><br />In short, readers, be they new to the Balance, or veterans, this chapter in the series will delight. Hats off to Ms. Taffs forwriting such a multidimensional story about such a fascinating world, that of Magick. Go out and get copies of all three books today, and be prepared to spend several hours engrossed in reading, beginning to end. But is it really the end? Of course not! Fans will be happy to hear there is already another book in the works.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, December 2003. All rights reserved.ry about such a fascinating world, that of Magick.

That's why none of us would chance it except for one thing. Life's not worth much without it.\\" Whether being used to describe God's love or the love of a man for a woman, or a friend for a friend, this is the underlying message in this book.<br /><br />Devra MacKay had left her home in Culdee Creek to find success as a plastic surgeon in New York. She was happy there, working for the rich and famous, making plenty of money to keep her in the lifestyle she has adopted. When her father dies, she must return home to Colorado, just in time for the Christmas holiday, to settle his estate. However, old feelings rise to the surface when she must again confront the one man she has ever loved.<br /><br />Ross Blackstone is the foreman of the ranch, whom Devra's father had taken under his wing years ago. Ross has a tainted past, one which he has paid for and desired to overcome. Logan gave him a job and set him on the path to find his way, and led him to Christ. Ross's only desire is to remain at Culdee Creek, working the land he has grown to love over the years. Now he is torn, he wants Devra to stay and run the ranch, but that could affect his role there, since they have never gotten along. If only she knew the truth of how he felt.<br /><br />As frustrations mount and old hurts are exposed once more, Devra must reevaluate all she has built for herself, and find her lost faith. Only one man can help her find her way. But is Ross enough?<br /><br />This was an enlightening story about finding one's path in the world. Devra had everything she could ever want, or so she thought, in the life she had created for herself. Along the way though, she had lost her faith, and her way, not even being aware of it until she returns for her father's funeral. She struggles with her decisions, trying to do what is right, but not knowing entirely what is the right thing anymore.<br /><br />Ross had lived a hard life before arriving on the MacKay's doorstep, but he had overcome that past and found his true calling, and a strong faith. Now he sees Devra struggling, and is afraid to help her, but afraid not to help her get back on track. Though he can't help but wonder if she will find her way again.<br /><br />Faith in God is the underlying message in this book. With Him, all things are possible. Though slightly too \\"preachy\\" for this reviewer, it did make her think. Fans of Inspirational Romance will be drawn to this book, as will those who have a strong faith of their own.

Her disastrous first marriage to a former employee of the company has made her swear off men or every marrying again. In retaliation, she had played cupid to all of the eligible bachelors at Wintersoft, her father's corporation, finding them their perfect mates. Only one single man remains, Jack Devon, but Emily feels there is no danger on that front.<br /><br />Jack Devon has his own reasons for avoiding any sort of romantic relationship with a woman, especially Emily. He has a family secret he keeps at all costs, for fear that if it was discovered, he'd risk reputation and his job at the company.

How about a young couple separated by a misunderstanding, who after 20 years get a second chance at the love they let slip away? Then there is the story of a single mother who lives solely for her daughter's happiness where that daughter has other plans... to help Mom find love again. A personal favorite of this reviewer is one about a young woman, scarred physically and emotionally as a result of an abusive relationship who only wants to heal, but finds happiness with a man who should represent all she is trying to escape.<br /><br />Also to be found is a story about a woman who gets stranded in a blizzard and happens upon the mountain retreat of a reclusive author, and finds love as a result. In one of two paranormal stories in the collection, one woman holds the key to unlocking an ancient curse placed on a pair of lovers several lifetimes ago. In the second, which is another one especially loved by this reviewer, a young lady who has dedicated her life to taking care of her ailing grandmother and everyone else, finally gets the chance to find herself through a passionate encounter with a very mysterious stranger. And lastly, what happens when a married couple loses the spark in their relationship, and one makes it their personal goal to reignite their passion?<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, July 2004.

Now, some time after the attack, she and her father are still healing, mentally and physically in some ways. Life has changed drastically for her with the birth of her baby, and she wouldn't give him up for anything.<br /><br />Jeb Carlson has been defending his country for several years in foreign lands. Now, all he cares about is coming back home to America and finding himself a nice parcel of land where he can build a homestead and a new life, close to those he loves, friend or family. However, life sometimes takes unexpected turns and can change even the strongest of plans.<br /><br />When fate strikes again and Elena's beloved baby is kidnapped by the same band of criminals, she would do anything to get her son back, even trust a mercenary she has just met to assist her. Now Elena and Jeb are streaking across Texas, following the trail of criminals to rescue her innocent child. Through it all, a relationship builds and grows, possibly leading them both to the place they never knew they were meant to be... together.<br /><br />The adventure stretches across Texas and across the border into Mexico, taking one along for the ride. Ms. Crooks paints a vivid picture of the scenery, so that one will see the beautiful landscape as Elena and Jeb ride over it. The secondary plot, that of just what those criminals are up to, is explosive for readers as well, and very true to the time in which this story takes place.<br /><br />Jeb and Elena are bold characters, strong-minded and with very full personalities, making readers feel as if they'd run into them in town. There was one part towards the end of the book though, where both of them act so out of character for how they've been portrayed, that this reviewer couldn't help but sit up and think, \\"what the heck was that all about?\\" It is so unexpected, that it can temporarily pull the reader out of the story. Even so, with this behavior to be so unusual for Jeb and Elena, it does work for the story, which is probably why things were written hat way. This makes them seem more realistic, as we all have been known to do something completely out of the norm for our usual behavior on occasion.<br /><br />This reviewer admits to not being a real fan of western historical romances, and most likely would not have picked up this book to read on her own, had she not received it from someone else. However, this book was surprisingly good throughout most of the book, even for one who is not a fan of the genre. Well, once readers can get past the seemingly unlikelihood of Elena running into the exact same group of bandits two years later, that is. Once belief is suspended on that aspect, the book is fast-paced and exciting, keeping readers interested through the end.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, May 2005.

She's a Certified Retribution Specialist in Chicago, dealing out justice on a contract basis. Her life is full and she's happy with things the way they are, satisfying those more feminine urges with her favorite cyborg Humphrey Bogart. When her estranged mother comes to her for help, Angel takes it lightly, until Lola disappears.<br /><br />Now Angel must track down the kidnappers and rescue her mother. Along comes detective Riccuccio Marco, who is working towards outlawing Angel's profession and he gets right in the middle of things, and under her skin. The two grudgingly combine forces to find Lola and find out they may have gotten more then they bargained for.<br /><br />This story packs quite a punch, as does Angel. She is a kick butt, take no prisoners kind of woman who doesn't need any man to foul things up. She's confident in her way of life and is quite content with her friends and lifestyle, if not entirely happy with her family. Lola is a zany fortune teller, has her fingers into many more pies then would be expected upon meeting her. Marco is a throwback to the typical PIs of 40s era movies, right down to attitude and wardrobe. Then there is Mike, the Shaolin monk from China who is Angel's friend, confidante, and personal trainer.<br /><br />The storyline is expansive with plenty going on to keep readers reading. There is quite a mix of sub plots that all combine seamlessly to create the bigger story. Readers will find run-ins with the mob, kidnapped children, a subterranean city, robots on every corner, and psychic abilities. Action is definitely the focal point of this story, not romance. However, this reviewer finds it refreshing to see believable heroines, with strong minds and bodies who are very independent. There is some romance worked in, but it is much understated so as to not overshadow the real story. Some readers will not like the fact that romance is secondary, but this is what the Bombshell series is meant to be.<br /><br />Having never read a book by Julie Beard before, this reviewer has nothing to compare this one to, but if Kiss of the Blue Dragon is indicative of the author's skills, then bring on some more! It is also great to know that this will not be the only Angel Baker story, as at least one more is soon to come.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, July 2005.

Though she doesn't advertise her magickal abilities, all of the supernatural beings in the city know her skill, and bring their cases to her. Her latest case, defending men's club owner Jurnik Golub, a vampire, will bring some changes in to her life.<br /><br />Lucan \\"Luc\\" Knight is the PI on the case. Jurnik is under fire for the murder of one of his former exotic dancers, who was also an ex-girlfriend of his, but he's innocent. Luc needs to find the real killer and exonerate Jurnik, and he uses his own special abilities to help. For he just happens to be a shape shifter with some pretty impressive other powers he keeps secret.<br /><br />Luc and Abbie become partners as they race against time to solve the mystery and protect their client. But danger mounts, as does their mutual attraction, the closer they get to solving the mystery, putting their lives at risk. Meanwhile they begin to wonder about becoming partners in more ways then one.<br /><br />This is a refreshing unique story that will appeal to readers of romance, mystery, or paranormal. All three are blended into a plot that zigs and zags to a rather surprising ending. Though the paranormal element is necessary to the plot, it is not the central theme, but takes more of a back seat to the murder mystery. This reviewer enjoyed the mystery, which did have plenty of magick surrounding it, but wouldn't have minded seeing even more focus on the paranormal aspects of the story, especially Jurnik's vampirism. It is touched on and part of the reason for the mystery, but it could have been expanded on a little more.<br /><br />There are many characters that add to the story, be they mere-mortals or supernatural beings. Abbie and Luc are the central characters who get in to all kinds of scrapes as the rush to find the real murderer. However, one will love Abbie's vivacious mother Ilana, who is pretty powerful in her own right... and just happens to be dating Abbie's newest client. Then there is Abbie's Uncle Vidal who has quite a female following, and is known for performing s&eacute;ances now and again, which will be crucial to solving this case. Of course, there have to be the \\"bad\\" guys as well since this is a murder mystery and there are some found. There is the slimy opposing council Jeffrey Walden III, who has been trying to attract some attraction from Abbie for quite some time. There are some other great villains as well, but this reviewer doesn't want to give anything away by mentioning names.<br /><br />Readers will enjoy this different kind of story and upon finishing it, will be impatiently waiting for the next book in the proposed series by this talented author.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

She begins to have strange dreams that haunt her nights, and experiences sexual longings never before experienced, every time she is in the presence of mysterious stranger, Peter Krieg. All she wants is to gain her inheritance so she can return home and care for her ailing mother.<br /><br />Peter Krieg is a stranger, and oddly enough, one of a family that was long thought dead. So when he appears at the castle, everyone is shocked that he even exists. He had been kept hidden his entire life, tasked with a duty to destroy an evil power lurking at the Mueller castle. No one knows his true purpose at the reading of the will, or why it was required that he even be there. When he meets the beautiful Sophia, he begins to realize his duty may be a little more difficult than expected. Love was never a part of the bargain.<br /><br />Strange happenings occur at the Mueller home and new people arrive who seem to know more then they are telling. When Sophia's cousin, Karl, disappears, it is feared he has succumbed to the evil. Is there any truth to the rumors of an ancient family curse that they will become werewolves? And how can Sophia and Peter defeat the terror that permeates the entire island?<br /><br />Sophia has some strong powers she's only begun to experience, and when they begin to awaken, her life changes permanently. These powers however, that should be her undoing, may actually be the key to conquering the evil forever. Peter Krieg is a dark, mysterious man who knows more than he is telling. The love he and Sophia discover together will inflame passions and a hunger that cannot be denied.<br /><br />Sophia is a heroine strong in heart and mind. She is braver than most women would be of her era. She is selfless in her devotion to her mother, as well as any other people she calls friend. When her passion for Peter begins to develop, she is confused and frightened, convinced it is a result of her curse. Peter is deeply mysterious, never revealing his true reason for being there until it is absolutely necessary. He is there to do his duty, so is shocked to find himself falling for Sophia. When their love for one another overcomes them, it is extremely passionate and all encompassing. The secondary characters all add depth to the story... and secrets, from the servants of the household, to the family solicitor, to Sophia's cousin, Karl. All are well developed and fully fleshed out, making the reader feel for them as well.<br /><br />This story is the stuff gothic romance is made of.

This book will delight readers and fans of horror, romance, and fantasy alike with the mystery and love story that unfolds here. The story grips readers in its clutches and will keep them reading long in to the night. The plot is fast moving and intriguing, with new details revealed at every turn.

This year, just in time for Christmas, she decides to chance it and ask her sexy neighbor, Ryan, to attend a Christmas party with her. Clothed only in a dress made of wrapping paper, she heads down to the dock to catch him on his boat and invite him to be her date. Never could she have expected that this was about to become the most adventurous... and dangerous... night of her life.<br /><br />The action is flying high in this story, with adventure after adventure for Stacy and Ryan. There are shoot-outs, drug cartels, and crooked cops, all with plenty of romance to round it out. Readers will like that they are kept guessing for much of the story, trying to figure out who the bad guys are and if Ryan is one of them. All Stacy wants is to try something new and get a little adventure in her life by asking Ryan out on a whim. When she gets much more than anticipated, how she deals with it is amusing, and makes the reader realize she's got spunk, even if she suppresses it normally.<br /><br />The second story, The Two Marys, by Katherine Hall Paige, was probably this reviewer's favorite story in the series. Readers meet plucky Faith Fairchild who is called in to help a neighbor, Mary Bethany, who finds a newborn baby and a huge stack of cash in her goats' barn. Now Faith has to investigate to help Mary find the mother of the baby and why she felt it necessary to give up her child.<br /><br />This was a story that helps to remind people what this time of year is all about. The parallels between this Christmas story and the original Baby born in a manger are heart-warming. Mary's life is her goats and that's all she's ever wanted in life. When a baby is given over to her, she finds out maybe there is more to life then her little farm and Bed and Breakfast after all. The mother of the child is a down on her luck; a young woman who wants only for her baby to have a better life then she has. The ending to this story is sad in some ways, a balancing of fate in others, and happy as well. Readers will finish this tale with a warm fuzzy feeling that love is the reason for the season.<br /><br />The third story in this collection, The Twelve Frogs of Christmas by Judi McCoy, is a funny one, and the one paranormal story in the collection. Here readers meet Claire St. Germaine and Dr. Hugh Burton. Claire is a young woman making a go at her own jewelry design business who has temporarily taken on an additional duty of rescuing men sent to her as frogs she has to kiss to break the spell. Hugh is a professor at a university, whose specialty happens to be... yes you guessed it... frogs! When a rare and nearly extinct species that Hugh happens to be researching is sent to Claire, sparks fly and love blossoms.<br /><br />This is a funny story bound to get some giggles out of the most finicky of readers. Readers are kept in the dark for most of the story as to who is sending the frogs to Claire and why, though the answers to those questions are revealed by the end. Hugh and Claire are unique individuals, and both stubborn in their own ways. When they butt heads over some amusing circumstances, readers feel the sparks flying and just know they'll make an interesting pair.<br /><br />The final story in this collection, The Thirteenth Santa, by Joanne Pence, introduces readers to Inspector Rebecca Mayfield with the SFPD, who is investigating a murder of a man in a Santa suit found at a local shopping mall. Richie Amalfi is on a mission to take 12 old men, decked out in Santa suits, to a destination only he knows, when his van with the Santas in it disappears. He goes to Rebecca for help and when she thinks this may be linked to her murder investigation, she tags along to help him track down the wayward men and gets more then she bargained for.<br /><br />This is a funny story, in a dry sort of way, and will appeal to readers. Rebecca and Richie make an interesting pair of detectives as they try to find answers to her investigation and track down the missing Santas. When the Mafia is mixed in, it gets even more interesting. This reviewer enjoyed how the author took the players and made many of them out as caricatures of mobsters and their cronies. There was a sarcastic bend to many of the humorous occurrences in the story that is sure to bring about a few laughs.<br /><br />If readers are looking for a different sort of Christmas season story, then this is one that isn't to be missed.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

US	52934870	R1KEJ3236C6MW0	0505526395	676811224	Celtic Fire	Books	4	18	23	N	N	A wonderful historical romance in ancient Ireland	Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />Joy Nash's debut book for Dorchester shows the talent she has developed over the past few years in the small press arena.<br /><br />Rhiannon, hidden queen of the Celts, desires to free her people from the invading Romans, but with as little bloodshed as possible. She longs to unite the clans and reach peace in their land, as soon as they can be rid of the Romans. When their powerful Druid Priest sacrifices one of the Romans to the horned god, she knows danger will draw even nearer as the invaders won't stand for such things.<br /><br />Lucius Aquila does not believe the reports of his brother Aulus' demise, as they don't ring true; especially in light of the fact his brother's ghost is haunting him. When he travels north to investigate, he is caught by surprise at the strength and cunning of an attack by the native people, and is even more shocked to find that his captive is a vivacious young beauty with enough passion to set him afire.<br /><br />Rhiannon and Lucius are attracted to each other from the first, but much stands in the way for them. Lucius begins to suspect that she has dark powers when he realizes that only she can free him from the agony of Aulus' spectral form, which has grown stronger and more troubling since coming north. Rhiannon is being commanded to lure him into her snare so her people can finish their rites to the horned god. What they don't realize is that their love can bring them salvation and maybe even peace between their people. Will they figure it out before it's too late?<br /><br />Here is an intriguing premise for a romance, taking place in a time not often featured in this genre. Fans of the paranormal subgenre will love the plot line of Aulus' ghost. This reviewer liked Ms. Nash's own spin on the idea of ghosts and the way this character changed throughout the story line, with a shock to come in the climactic battle scene towards the end of the novel.<br /><br />Rhiannon's character was interesting in how she was drawn. She is a very strong woman, with some special skills and abilities that come into play several times in the story. For as strong as she is, the author stayed true to the times with Rhiannon, who even though she is a queen in her own right, her people don't respect her as much as they will when she chooses her king. She has many internal battles to face as she longs to do what is right for her people, without compromising her heart and wisdom. She has a deep well of love to share, as can be evidenced in her relationship with her brother, Owein, and Lucius' young son Marcus, as well as in her passion for Lucius. It is also interesting to learn of her ancestress' history and how that permanently affected the clans. Rhiannon wants to be strong and brave as her grandmother was, but without endangering her people.<br /><br />Lucius' character is vividly portrayed, as are his internal battles. He longs to get to the bottom of the mystery of his brother's death, so as to allow his spirit eternal rest. He knows his duty to his land, and knows what he must do, as much as he wishes he could have a different life. One will like seeing how he grows and changes throughout the story, with the evidence of them being found in the relationship he has with his son.<br /><br />One very well done plot device was the use of religion to progress the story line. The pagan beliefs of the Celts, and their need for sacrifices, is crucial to the story, as is the lesson some learn about how power gained can corrupt a person. It was interesting to see the differences between the beliefs of the Romans and those of the Celts, and how their beliefs lead them on their chosen paths, as well as how they all come to terms with their faiths and how it affects them, in the end of the story.<br /><br />Joy Nash is definitely one to be watched. She has great world building skills, and her own personal magic with the pen is guaranteed to make hers a very strong name onthe market in the not too distant future.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

He's come to Erie, PA to find his betrothed. Needless to say, he's quite surprised when a spunky, no-nonsense, Harley riding, redhead greets him at the airport instead. Shey Carlson would do anything for a friend, even run interference on an unwanted fianc&eacute;.<br /><br />Tanner and Shey couldn't be more different. He's royalty, for heaven's sake! She is an intelligent, independent woman who has worked hard for everything she has. So why is it that the more she tries to keep him occupied and away from Parker, the more she wants to be with him? However, he's got a marriage of duty and responsibility to a princess on the brain. Or does he? As it turns out, Shey may be exactly what he really wants... and needs.<br /><br />Ms. Jacobs continues her Perry Square Royalty trilogy with this second book. As always, her characters come alive as kind and friendly souls readers would expect to bump into in their own hometowns. Shey's tough biker chic façade protects her heart of gold. She loves her friends dearly and having had a tough childhood knows what it is like to need help, so she gives back in her own way. She gives food to the hungry and teaches some how to read, being passionate about illiteracy. One can't help but love her.<br /><br />Tanner grew up never lacking for anything, except maybe love. His parents were too busy doing their royal duty to care much about him. His attempts to find love have always ended when the woman cared more about his crown than they did him. Maybe that's why he bonded so strongly with his security team, who are more friends then bodyguards. He had hoped his engagement would give him what he needed, but never realized how empty his life had been... until Shey dropped in to his life.<br /><br />This book is interesting in that it actually takes place at the same time as Once upon a Princess, which was released in May, so there are some scenes from the first book in this one as well, but from a different perspective. Many of the fellow Perry Square residents pop in for a visit, as is to be expected in this series. Holly Jacobs has developed quite a cozy little family through her sweet romances. When readers open one of her books, they find they have once again come home to where they belong.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, April 2005.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />In this first tale of the Tarlisian world, Julie D'Arcy spins a vivid story of good vs. evil, magic and adventure.<br /><br />So the legend goes... Garrick le Fey, the First King of Tarlis, sacrificed himself and his freedom to protect his people from evil. He is transformed into a black dragon and trapped in a magical book, with his old nemesis, Narokah, high priest to Arahmin the God of Blood, who turned into a red dragon when Garrick tried to kill him.<br /><br />Centuries later, a carpenter unknowingly breaks the spell binding Narokah and Garrick, unleashing a great horror on the world once more. Dragon by day, man by night, Garrick must retrieve an ancient elven sword, the only weapon capable of destroying the high priest, and prevent the final ritual that will release Arahmin.<br /><br />Meggahn du Val, daughter of the Low-Lord of Gola-Dah, is doomed to a marriage with the sadistic Baron Madric le Mordah, the Red Lord. When contemplating her fate on her final night of freedom, she sees a black dragon shoot across the sky. Deciding to ask the dragon for aid, she sets out on the first steps of a grand adventure. Whoever would have thought she would have her life irrevocably changed and her heart stolen by a legendary king of old?<br /><br />The journey is just beginning in this book, with escapades on every page that will keep one eager to see what comes next, all the way to the surprise revealed at the end. This story is primarily a fantasy novel, but it does have its underlying love stories. The descriptions of the world are brilliantly done; with scents, sounds, and colors jumping out at the readers so they can't help but be drawn into the story.<br /><br />The characters are realistic, with thoughts and feelings, fears and desires, just like everyone. Garrick's only wish is to protect his world and his people from being destroyed by dreadful evil. He is even willing to sacrifice himself if it means keeping those he cares about safe. Meggahn is a brave woman, wanting her freedom from a dreadful man, as well as wanting his reign of terror to their people to cease. She is willing to do almost anything to see that happen. All of the secondary characters add to the story as well. There is Vellandril, the elven prince who puts duty to his people above matters of the heart. One will love Johden, the young servant to Garrick who longs to be a warrior. And who can forget the frightening Narokah and Madric? Yet their desire to inflict living misery on the people is matched by the goodness of Ejinerah, guardian of the Orb of de Danann, and Arkron the wizard friend of Garrick.<br /><br />This book captivated this reviewer and has made her eager to read the rest of the books in the series written by the talented Ms. D'Arcy.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

Fleeing a depressing place in which she had recently been imprisoned, she goes on the run to find the one man she feels can help her. She needs to find the Prince of Venya in the hopes he can help her escape the wrath of her uncle. The man she finds is nothing like the stories and legends claim, but someone infinitely more intriguing.<br /><br />Florian barely held on to his life a fateful day many years ago, when the wretched King Richard killed his parents and took over the lands of Venya. As a result, he made a vow that no matter what the risk, he would one day rid his lands of Richard, and assume his rightful place as ruler. He has no time for a misguided young woman whom he feels is slightly mad... or does he?<br /><br />When Florian realizes Rose may be his greatest hope in ending the long years of war, he determines to make her his by fair means or foul, and sets his course. Little did either of them realize that they'd find their greatest strengths in each other... and a love that is the stuff legends are made of.<br /><br />This was a wonderful story! Ms. Minogue weaves a passionate tale, full of suspense, romance, mystery, and a healthy dose of the paranormal. Readers will venture in to the swashbuckling world of pirates, where no one is quite what they seem, and magic is the name of the game. The plot is swift moving and well developed, luring one in on the first page and holding tight until the final scenes unfold, surprising in their outcome.<br /><br />Rose is a brave woman, who puts all else before herself, never minding the risk to her own life. She is deeply passionate, highly intelligent, very caring, and in love with a legend. Florian has one mission in life and always has - to restore his people to their rightful land and to take his place as ruler of the magical land. He is strong willed, also very passionate, and finds himself taken with the young beauty who seeks his aid. When these two come together, their love is all consuming but not without its ups and downs.<br /><br />Magic, as mentioned before, is a primary player woven into the story. The `filidhi', who fled Venya, are a people of great wisdom and none too lacking in magical abilities. Their skills come into play many times throughout the story, adding a mystical bend to the tale. Florian himself has some pretty impressive abilities, though one is kept in the dark as to what they are through much of the story, with the secret only being revealed when most necessary to the storyline. Also there are other fantastical beings in the story, like the Ilindrian race of people who have some unique traits of their own, and the sea-going merrow, who appear to be much like what is more commonly known as a mermaid. These beings add interesting facets to the story, making it the impressive fantasy it is.<br /><br />All of the secondary characters are rendered beautifully, with unique personalities. This reviewer was intrigued by many of them. There was the young brave Beylik, a former slave, Florian's surgeon, Sigurd who is not what he seems, the young Ilindrian shipmate Ashkii, King Cristobal of Sorlain, the filidhi Mage apprentice Caelan and the hated King Richard. Everyone adds depth and dimension to the story, making for a more than satisfying read.<br /><br />This was a fascinating story that this reviewer thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend highly. Also, she has a sneaking suspicion that there may be sequels yet to come, having found some characters just longing for their own stories to be told.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, December 2004.

Everyone thought she was making it up as a way to deal with her grief, but she knew better. That creature was real and she dedicated her adult life to proving it.<br /><br />Nathan Cross is one of an ancient cursed race, sworn to protect innocents from evil for all of eternity. He is a gargoyle, immortal and hating it. Born again and again over the centuries with memories of all that came before, he is weary of this life and agonizing over what is lost. When he meets Rachel, all his pain is before him again.<br /><br />Rachel knows something is different about Nathan the first moment she sees him. Little does she know just how different. When she starts to investigate a murder to which some of the gargoyles were witnesses, she must track them down to get to the bottom of things. He is sworn to protect his people's secret at any cost, but his passion for her consumes him. But what will happen when she discovers he may hold the key to her parents' deaths? And how will she react to discover he is one of the very monsters she seeks?<br /><br />This is one fabulous story that will keep readers turning those pages all the way to the end of the book. This reviewer never would have considered a gargoyle as a sexy and stirring tortured hero but it sure works here. This is a very unique premise for a story and that in itself would be enough to keep one interested. The characters are compelling and the background on the gargoyles is fascinating, which also adds to the reader's desire to see what will come next.<br /><br />Nathan is a driven man. He is torn between his desires to leave behind what his people expect of him and his longing to belong to something. He's a loner, having broken tradition by trying to modernize the gargoyle society. When he meets Rachel, his desire for her goes against everything he thinks he wants. The fact that she hates his people, without knowing anything about them makes his relationship with her quite rocky.<br /><br />Rachel has seen and survived horrors no one would believe, and that has colored everything she thinks and feels. Her drive to prove the existence of monsters could, and has, made her an object of ridicule with many people. She is strong willed and full of passion in her beliefs, which make her a very intriguing person. Her whole world is knocked off kilter with this latest case and sets things in motion for the shocking discovery she makes towards the end of the book.<br /><br />Carved in Stone is the first book in a new series by the newcomer Vickie Taylor. If this story is anything to go by, future books by this author will be just as impressive. This is an author to watch as she is bound to become a future star.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

All three of them are witches with unique powers, and Sophie has always felt hers were the weakest of the three. In spite of the curse placed on their family centuries ago, Sophie dreams of finding someone whom can give her what she desires most... a baby. When she begins to dream about a handsome green-eyed stranger, she knows he will be the father of her first child. But fate has more in plan for her...<br /><br />Kane is a soldier who is nearly killed when his army is ambushed. He escaped, barely, and thinks his life is over. When a mysterious beautiful young woman comes to him, she healed his injuries and seduced him. Now, a year later he is seeking out the dream woman, not even sure if she was real. When he finds Sophie, he knows she is his angel and he's shocked to see their baby. He decides he must do what is right and marry Sophie right away.<br /><br />Sophie is shocked to see Kane again, having expected nothing of the sort, and she's even more shocked he wants to marry her. She cannot marry and risk falling in love with him, or it could mean his death, per the family curse. However, when a villager who has plans of his own for Sophie kidnaps their baby, they must work together to get their daughter back. What will happen when they grow closer throughout the perilous journey? Are they strong enough to beat the ancient curse?<br /><br />This first book, The Sun Witch, in a new trilogy by Linda Winstead Jones, is a real treat for fans, be they old or new. She skillfully weaves a tale of fantasy and magick that is intriguing and sure to keep readers waiting for the next two books. The plot moves quite well, dragging slightly in the beginning but picking up steam as the pages are turned. The details woven into the book about the magickal realm of the sisters Fyne and their talents are complex, vivid and real, making the story come alive.<br /><br />Sophie is a strong young woman, who has her desires that she is afraid to give in to, as they are bound to come back to haunt her in the end. Or so she thinks anyhow. When she fully comes to understand her powers and how to use them, her strength as a person and as a witch grows within her, surprising everyone, not the least of whom being herself. Her love for her daughter is strong and true, the one thing that is powerful enough to overcome the most dangerous of enemies.<br /><br />There are also several subplots woven in seamlessly, which only serve to enhance the story, and bring the secondary characters to life. One will particularly enjoy the story of Sebastyen the emperor and his most trusted concubine Liane, as it has some surprising twists thrown in and a rather unusual romance as well. Also, there are hints given in that if picked up on, will provide the reader with a clue as to what is to come in book 2 in the trilogy.<br /><br />In short, Ms. Jones' story is bound to please anyone who is a fan of this particular genre, and will satisfy all her fans. Be forewarned however, reading this book will make waiting for the next story, The Moon Witch, due out this spring, extremely difficult.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, March 2005.

Off he goes to Wind Lake, Minnesota to get to the bottom of things. He finds no answers when he arrives, but he does find a surprise.<br /><br />Marlie Anderson runs the daycare center in her hometown, never having desired to go anywhere else. For several months she had been writing to Bobby Luchetti, a soldier in the US Army. Although his letters had suddenly ceased, Colin shows up on her doorstep and tells her Bobby sent him.<br /><br />Colin is bored out of his mind, eager to move on to more exciting places, but he is convinced that this is where word will come of Bobby's whereabouts. The longer he stays, the more he comes to admire, and love Marlie. But she is Bobby's girl so how can he ever claim her for himself?<br /><br />Ms. Handeland once again demonstrates her skill at weaving emotional stories that tug at the heartstrings. This reviewer found herself laughing out loud over the antics of the children, as well as getting tears in her eyes over some powerfully emotional scenes. One will feel everything along with Marlie, Colin, and company.<br /><br />Everyone is so realistic in this book, adding to the character-driven plotline. Colin has his irrational fear of Houdini the guinea pig, and Marlie is insecure about her appearance as a glasses-wearing slightly overweight young woman, and finds it hard to believe someone like Colin could love her. Even the secondary characters show their weaknesses and strengths. Marlie's mother loses herself in game shows to forget that her late husband and the love of her life is never coming home again. Then too, how can anyone remain unmoved at Garth, Marlie's best friend, and his precocious son Jake's heartbreak over losing Garth's beloved wife?<br /><br />Readers will be drawn into the story from the beginning, riding the waves of all the emotional rises and dips found in this book.

His punishment? He must go to Earth, where no one can see or hear him, except a small child, so he can bring a pair of star-crossed lovers together and possibly redeem himself in the eyes of his superiors.<br /><br />Brandy Mitchum has always been just a few pennies away from the poorhouse, struggling to make ends meet and raise her young daughter in the best way she can. A string of jobs where her bosses felt her home life interfered with her career life has left her feeling desperate and working as a paralegal for a rather selfish lawyer of a boss. What she really desires deep down is to find the one man who is her soulmate, who will fulfill her life in ways she has only before imagined.<br /><br />Trick Templeton is a confirmed bachelor whose love `em and leave `em perspective on relationships has always served him well.

However, can a little help from a pair of matchmakers, Chloe and her \\"invisible\\" friend Celestian, show these star-crossed lovers that what they've always needed can be found in each other?<br /><br />This is a sweet story that makes a good addition to the Soulmates line by Silhouette Romance.

Brandy's life revolves around her daughter and every decision she makes is for her benefit. She believes her own life can and should take a back seat to her daughter's no matter how many struggles she has to go through.<br /><br />Trick and Brandy clash from the moment they meet, but there are more then just sparks of temper glowing. They both feel a strong attraction, and it goes against everything they want in their lives. But love will not be denied, especially when they have their own \\"guardian angel\\" pushing them together. When these two finally give in to their desires, they find more then they bargained for, and a forever kind of love.<br /><br />This reviewer was glad to see Celestian again, having enjoyed his antics in Ms. Morris' previous novel. Seeing him go from something of a celestial snob to a sensitive caring being will delight readers. He has always had a tendency to bend the rules to his needs, and how he does so in this story provides some humor to the tale.

His captors actually wanted his brother Jake, who is one of five genetically altered children who were adopted many years ago. The people who took him believing him to be Jake think he has information they need. Unlucky for them they grabbed the wrong brother.<br /><br />Dr. Maisy Dalton is the best in her field. She is a brilliant psychiatrist, a master at deprogramming and hypnotherapy. When she is called in to work with \\"Jake\\" she expects it to be a run of the mill situation. She never expected that what she'd find would be highly dangerous to her life... and her heart.<br /><br />This first full-length book in the Family Secrets series sets the stage for the books to follow. Mystery abounds as Maisy tries to get to the bottom of what has happened to Zach since he was kidnapped. Zach is weak from being drugged and feels helpless while she is risking life and limb to keep him safe. The love grows between them throughout all the adversity they face giving the readers faith that all will work out in the end.<br /><br />This reviewer was a little disappointed in how little reference was made to the \\"Extraordinary Five,\\" the now adult genetically superior people. The premise of this series is supposed to be about these five children who were altered to be superhuman. Only a few brief mentions were made to them, mainly by the kidnappers. It would have been preferred to have a little more information given in to the background of the five and what it was done to make them the \\"Extraordinary Five,\\" which is what drew this reader to the series.<br /><br />This book will appeal to readers who love to have a bit of suspense with their romance, so long as they don't expect to delve into the underlying theme of the Family Secrets series.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

Worth, TX to be closer to his family. He's been a single parent to two girls ever since the death of his wife in a car accident. His 15-year old daughter, Brook, has been steadily pulling away from him, getting into trouble in school, and making it clear she had some emotional issues to deal with. He has hopes that being closer to his sister's new family and his father will help draw Brook out and maybe bring her back in to the fold of the family before it's too late.<br /><br />Jenna Quinn is a free spirit who enjoys her single life. She is a \\"take-it-as-it-comes with no strings\\" kind of person whose personal motto seems to be \\"Eat dessert first.\\" She is immediately drawn to Sloan, even though she \\"doesn't do kids\\" and always swore to not get involved with a single dad. His agreement to the \\"just casual\\" relationship delights is just what she wants, but something about Sloan and his troubled daughter tugs at her heart and she can't help but be pulled into their little family.<br /><br />Sloan gets the shock of his life when Brook announces she's pregnant, and shortly thereafter, Jenna tells him she's pregnant also. Now he must deal with not one, but two hormonal pregnant women, and the idea that he's about to be a grandfather and a father at the same time. Emotions are high and family life tense, as he tries to help Brook make the right decision. All the while he has some heavy-duty decision-making of his own to tackle. Will the bonds of love and family be enough to pull them all through this difficult time?<br /><br />Wow! This is an emotionally charged story that grips readers in its clutches and holds on to the end. Ms. Gable is known for covering sensitive issues in her books, while telling a moving story that always captivates. Be prepared for some intense scenes that will leave one reaching for a box of tissues while feeling the emotions of the characters. The delicate topic of teen pregnancy is approached with tenderness and skill, presenting all the options as Brook makes the hardest decision of her life. This reviewer cried buckets several times, in breakthrough scenes as the family comes to terms with what has happened. Blame is never placed anywhere and when Brook makes her decision, readers are sure to be moved beyond words at the struggle the young girl has gone through to get there.<br /><br />Jenna and Sloan are perfect for each other. She helps him to loosen up with her free spirit and plays a big part in helping him to adjust to the curveballs thrown his way. Sloan is the balance to the roller coaster of emotions Jenna experiences before, during and after pregnancy. Without each other they are incomplete, but when they join forces in their love, there is no situation they can't handle together.<br /><br />Brook is probably one of the strongest developed characters found here, from her willfulness, her anger at her father over the death of her mother and the role she is convinced he played, to her newfound strength and wisdom as she goes through the months of her pregnancy. One has hope for her, and by the time the story is closed, knows that she'll make it and be all the better a person as she passes from childhood into womanhood.<br /><br />Readers get to visit with some beloved characters from The Mommy Plan, one of Ms. Gable's previous books, and will delight in seeing how they've progressed in their own lives. Other secondary characters play a big role as well, from Ashley, Sloan's darling 6-year old, to Jenna's best friends, from the father of Brook's baby, to his parents, and Sloan's and Jenna's parents as well.<br /><br />Once again, Susan Gable proves her skill as a writer, and readers can look forward to yet another emotional powerhouse of a book from this author.<br/><br />© Kelley A.

How can he tell him that his beloved eldest son is dead from treason and the other two brothers were pressed into service in Robert the Bruce's army? And that's not even the worst of it... the real shocker is that Ailig has been ordered by the King to take over as clan chief, effective immediately.<br /><br />Morainn MacRailt is a young widow who is content in her life on the edge of the village. She has sworn she will never marry again, but will remain free to live as she pleases. When Ailig returns, she feels for his plight but believes he will succeed. Her support means much to Ailig, even though she resists the attraction between them, remaining true to her vow to stay independent.<br /><br />The situation has yet to grow even more tense, however. A rival clan wants more power, Ailig's father refuses to step down as Clan Chief until Ailig proves himself, and the doubts of the clan threaten all they hold dear. Will Ailig and Morainn's bond be enough to bring peace to their clan? And what of her vow to never love or marry again?<br /><br />Laurin Wittig shows once again with Daring the Highlander that she is a powerful force in the Scottish historical genre. Her descriptive imagery will transport readers to the Highlands and the turbulent times when Robert the Bruce tries to unite all of Scotland. Readers will feel the wind on their faces, as they see and smell the winter snow along with the characters.<br /><br />Ailig is a young man thrust into a position he never dreamed of having. His doubts are real, as are his internal strength and sharp mind. He knows his position is tentative and that many in his clan are hoping for his failure, but he never lets that sway him. He still goes his way and holds on to his desire to make things right, knowing that is the only way to earn respect. Morainn is a kind and generous woman who wants her independence, just not at the cost of others. When Ailig needs her help, she never gives it a second thought and just comes to his aid, knowing he deserves to be chief. Though she values her independence above all else, she surprisingly finds herself succumbing to his desire.<br /><br />When Ailig and Morainn finally come together, their mutual respect, love and passion leap from the pages straight into the reader's heart. The blend of characters in this book gives a wonderfully developed story that will engross one from beginning to end. Everyone has their role to play, from Skaeth the mercenary and Neill the chief of Clan Leod to Duff MacDonell of the rival clan and Giorsal the healer. Without every character, the tale would fall flat, not being as beautiful as it is.<br /><br />One can never go wrong with a book by Ms. Wittig and this reviewer eagerly awaits the next story.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

Unfortunately for her, she was born with impressive mage talents that she needs to keep hidden. If anyone knew just how strong her abilities were she'd have to leave her home and move to the royal palace to be trained. However power like hers can only be hidden for so long and the day comes that Della No-Cozen, Mage to the Royal family, finds Chime and takes her away to learn the ways of the Shape Mages and possibly wed the heir to the throne.<br /><br />In a matter of months Chime's life is turned upside down. Just as she is starting to settle in to her new role, when she is finally beginning to feel like she fits in, another powerful mage, Iris, is found who holds abilities unlike anyone has ever seen. At the same time, Muller, Chime's betrothed and the former heir, is released from his future position. In the middle of all these changes, a neighboring land's ruler decides time is ripe to overthrow Aronsdale. Now Muller and Chime must use their love and their abilities to help the new king, Muller's cousin, and his young wife Iris to conquer the evil pervading their homeland.<br /><br />This is a unique and intriguing look at the brilliant world created by Ms. Asaro. The land where power is held by those strongest in the magic of colors and shapes will capture the imaginations of many readers, be they fans of romance or fantasy, or both. The imagery is vivid and readers will be enveloped in the lives and world of the characters. The rules of society are well defined, giving this fantasy the feeling that there could be such a world out there somewhere. Though some aspects of the magic and life found there get confusing at times, by the end of the book, one will understand how things work in Aronsdale.<br /><br />The players in this saga are brilliantly rendered. Muller feels like he can never measure up and that he is twisted inside, never to be free of the cursed abilities. Chime feels like she will never quite fit in to the elegant life of royalty, being more comfortable climbing trees than learning magic and propriety. These two are set adrift when their world changes. If not for the love they found in each other, they'd be lost. Jarid, the new king, is a tortured man; eaten up with guilt over something he did as a young boy that he could not control. Iris is a simple mountain girl who comes in to her own when she is taken under the wing of Della and the royal advisors.<br /><br />If readers are looking for a well-told fantasy tale that takes place in a brilliant world of magic, then The Charmed Sphere is for them.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />Whoever would have thought the big city with the small town heart, Erie, PA, would be home to royalty?<br /><br />Parker Dillon is a real, live princess... and hates every minute of it. After all, who wouldn't hate spending their entire life under a microscope? She hates the glamour, the press and the paparazzi as much as she loves her family. She has escaped to the U.S. for a while, has been able to go to college in relative anonymity and has had some semblance of a normal life. Unfortunately her father the king wants her to come home, resume her royal duty, and get married. She has no desire for that, so what's a girl to do?<br /><br />Jason \\"Jace\\" O'Donnell is a private investigator, hired by Parker's father to follow her and make sure she is safe until she realizes it is time to go home. He's only doing his job, rather well too, until Parker catches him and figures it out. She had intended to give him grief until he quit, but the tables are turned when spending time with Jace makes her realize she wants more from him... maybe forever. But as much as Jace desires her, he can't get past their differences. Can a princess and a PI overcome the odds and stake out a more permanent job of love?<br /><br />Ms. Jacobs once again proves she has a penchant for weaving a sweet story of romance with engrossing characters. Her books are always full of witty banter and powerful attraction between her main characters. Jace and Parker both show a strong personality and deep emotions. They are perfect for each other, if only they could figure that out.<br /><br />There are several subplots woven in to the book as well, which will make readers hope for more to be revealed in the two coming books in this trilogy. There is the broken marriage of Shelly, Jace's sister, and how that has affected her two children and her brother. Then there is also the side story of Parker's unwanted fianc&eacute;, Tanner, and one of her best friends, Shey, and the relationship that shimmers to life between them, promising more adventures for these two. And there is the shy quiet Cara, Parker's other dear friend, who deserves her own story.

She's always had less magical ability then her sisters. Where her sisters were strikingly beautiful, Juliet felt she was plain and unremarkable. Yet she had come to terms with her place in the family and accepted who she was. However when she and her eldest sister Isadora are kidnapped by the emperor's armies, her life is about to get interesting.<br /><br />Ryn is of a different race... part human, part wolf; his life is subject to the phases of the moon. For as long as he can remember, he's dreamed of a red-haired woman who was meant to be his. When he finds her in the hands of her captors, he rescues her, only to make her his own captive as he took her to his home.<br /><br />Along the way they find middle ground, growing closer and closer to each other as Juliet accepts she is to be Ryn's mate. That is, until the day they arrive and she finds that fate is not done with her yet. Ancient prophecy foretold of the coming of a new leader of his people, but can Juliet and Ryn overcome the beliefs of his people to find their own happiness? And what of her powers that have grown remarkably throughout her journey. What does that mean for their newfound love?<br /><br />Juliet was probably this reviewer's favorite of the Fyne sisters and she is therefore glad to have her story. Juliet is the peacemaker of the family, quiet, soft spoken, making sure things run smoothly. She's always had the opinion she was less then her sisters, but never let that get in the way of their relationship. When she is kidnapped and rescued by her new captor, she finally has the chance to come in to her own. No longer in the shadows of her powerful sisters, her own beauty and abilities have room to shine. Her reaction to how her life has turned out is believable, something to which anyone can relate.<br /><br />Ryn is all alpha male, a given considering the fact he is of a race of wolf shape shifters. Too often authors make shape shifters too human for the fact they are half animal. It was refreshing to see that Ms. Jones does not discount the animalistic nature of Ryn's kind. He has human emotions and behaviors, but his more primal behavior caused by what he is, is given its due as well. How he determines Juliet is his, as well as the way he reacts to her, is a result of the wolf half of his nature.<br /><br />Readers will also love the mystical bend given to Juliet's abilities. She is of the earth, and as such that is the root of all her power and strength. The prophecy of Ryn's people adds a different view to the story, playing an interesting role considering the curse on the Fyne women. How these two legends come together makes for an interesting read.<br /><br />Enough of a glimpse is given in to the other players in the series to satisfy readers as well. We see a bit of Sophie and how her life has played out. There is also perspective given in to Isadora's nature that hints at what will come in her own story. Then who can forget the Emperor and Liane, their own love story being expanded upon in this book. It is evident that none of these plot lines are compete yet, which will make one very eager to read the concluding title in the trilogy, The Star Witch, due out in December 2005.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

She had been looking forward to a summer vacation of doing nothing more strenuous then sitting on the beach at Presque Isle all day, every day, reading her favorite books. Until the day her ancient car dies. Fortunately for her, things are looking up. She is a finalist in WLVH - Love Handles \\"Where love is more then just a song\\" contest to win a brand new pickup truck.<br /><br />Ethan Westbrook has no desire to compete in a game for the radio station, but his father convinces him this is the perfect publicity stunt to draw more attention to their small family-owned pharmacy store chain. He has no interest in living in a pickup, or even winning the truck, but gives in to his father and decides it's worth it to bring attention to the business.<br /><br />All Ethan and Mary have to do is live in a pickup truck day and night until the other one gives up and gets out. The last person in the truck wins the game and the vehicle. Mary desperately needs this truck though she'd never admit that to hunky Ethan, and he wants to win so he can get more business for the stores. Neither one expected that forced proximity would be the start of quite an attraction between the two of them. But what happens when the contest is over? Will their newfound feelings outlast the game? Or is it all just a result of the close living quarters?<br /><br />As always, Ms. Jacobs' book is full of situational comedy and lots of laughs. Her unique humor is always guaranteed to add sparkle to whatever she decides to write about. Only she can take something like a reality show and turn it into a cute romantic story. The plot is kept relatively simple, so the primary focus can be on the characters.<br /><br />Mary thinks of herself as a Plain Jane, but she's happy in the life she's chosen. Her mother has always been too much of a free spirit for her, and Mary swore she would not be like her mother. She even went so far as to change her name to something simple and boring to make her life the way she wanted it. She takes joy in her life with her students but is thrilled for a chance to relax, even if it is not quite the way she had expected it. When love opens her eyes to the world around her, she realizes that maybe it isn't so bad to be a little carefree after all. Ethan comes off as stiff and boring in the beginning, only caring about the business and how this contest can help his pharmacies. But as we get to know him, we find there is more to him then meets the eye. Before the end of the book, he loosens up considerably and readers will find out he's not at all the staid professional he tries to make everyone think he is.<br /><br />Readers will even find a nice secondary romance here, in Ethan and Mary's parents. Also of interest, is the not so obvious relationship between Punch and Judy, the disk jockeys hosting the contest. These two have sparks flying so much that one can't help but wonder if it is all an act put on for their listeners.

Now known as Joe and Jessica Giambrocco, they have begun to adapt to their new home, and have many challenges facing them in their mated relationship as well.<br /><br />Almost immediately upon recovering from injuries sustained in his last battle, Tony is called upon by his old mob boss, Carmine, for a special case. It turns out Carmine and his wife Linda's special third party in their marriage, Babs, who just so happens to be the werewolf who converted Tony, has been kidnapped, but not by any ordinary villain. Her captor is thought to be another Sazi, who is preying on others of their kind. Only Tony can handle this case, with help from friend Bobby Mbutu, Wolven agent to the whole Sazi population.<br /><br />Things grow more complicated however; as Tony begins to acquire new Sazi powers he can't quite control yet and has to adjust to his position in his new wolf pack in Chicago, headed by Nikoli. When more Sazi women turn up dead, and others disappear, all in the midst of planning a huge conference for all of the Sazi species, the situation grows more dire. They all realize the enemy they are dealing with is far deadlier then anything they've encountered in a very long time, and is a species they thought long obliterated. Can they track down the kidnapper before it is too late for Babs and the other women?<br /><br />Wow! Ms. Clamp and Ms. Adams pull no punches with this story. It is darker, grittier, and more suspenseful then its prequel. Readers will love the world created in this series, and especially enjoy the complex society made up of shape shifters of every kind imaginable. The plot is fast paced, full of mystery, and drives onward to the thrilling climax that will leave readers breathless.<br /><br />The authors' voice is truly their own, and that is all the more evident in this book. Though there is less focus on the Mafia world here, readers are given a glimpse into an even more compelling and complicated world, that of the Sazi. Yet there is still enough of the darker side of Tony's personality visible, and readers also get to visit with some old acquaintances.<br /><br />What is interesting is that though Sue and Tony are the main characters again in this story, the underlying story is about Bobby and Asri, his mate whom he finds in this story. Seeing the reptilian Bobby brought to his knees by his love for the petite but powerful dragon of a woman, Asri, is a sight to behold. All of the conflicts arising between them are given full rein, through the newfound powers of Tony, who is still the storyteller here.<br /><br />Readers, be they new to the world of the Sazi, or coming back for more, are guaranteed to be thoroughly entertained.

Her father, Mikkasah, King of Rastehm, was sworn to uphold a decree made by the Goddess Herself that all magick in their world be removed, so as to save their world from the evil sorcerer, Iraj. She was raised in our modern world by a kind and loving family in Australia, then London, never knowing that she held a mystical key to save both worlds.<br /><br />Faren, a Knight of Paladia and sworn to the service of Mikkasah, has been sent to travel through time and track down a crystal pyramid, used to trap the demonic minions of Iraj of Istani. Iraj managed to avoid imprisonment, and is something of a parasite, taking over bodies, casting out their souls and then tossing aside the bodies when he has used them up. He is currently trapped in the body of Peter Waymer, a cancer victim. The crystal prison has been damaged in a time shift and it is only a matter of time until Iraj has enough power to release his servants so they can heal his body and he can take over both worlds.<br /><br />Silverdawn gets a shocking revelation when she finds out her true identity from Faren, and the two of them must combine forces with other allies to defeat Iraj, restore the pyramid, and save their respective worlds. But neither counted on the love that would grow between them... Will their passion for one another be enough? And what of Silverdawn? How will she react upon discovering the choices before her as a powerful Princess?<br /><br />Julie D'Arcy has created a world of magick with Silverdawn that encompasses so much that readers are sure to be pleased with this story. She combines many different facets of paranormal romance into her story so that there is something for everyone, be they fans of romance, fantasy, time-travel, or adventure. The plot is well thought out, driving forward with strength from the opening lines, never losing steam through the final climactic battle of good vs. evil.<br /><br />Silverdawn is a complex individual who only wishes to live out the life she has always known. When she is suddenly faced with mythical beings like griffins and horrific monsters like undead zombies, though in shock at the change, she handles it all surprisingly well for one who has ever believed there was no such thing as magick. She is more shocked then anyone to find out she is the only one who can save both worlds from destruction.<br /><br />Faren has only one goal in life, to please his king and fulfill the missions given to him to uphold their world's ways. He is a strong warrior, well trained in the art of war, but still gentle enough to be the shoulder to cry on for his own damsel in distress. His duty surpasses all for him so when he falls in love with Silverdawn, he must choose what is most important, his duty or his love.<br /><br />The rest of the cast of characters is well done also, from the aging mage Pendragon, to Iraj the evil sorcerer, to Kalden, Faren's foster brother, and the number of other key players. There are also a couple shockers of plot twists involving some of these people that come into play in the story, though for this reader, it is hard to believe that one of those mysteries was not solved by our lead characters earlier on. In spite of that one minor factor that seemed it should have been obvious; this is a delightful story that is a fast, exciting read one will hate to put down even for a minute. Readers will eagerly await more vivid tales from the mind of Ms. D'Arcy.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, December 2004.

The rest of the cast of characters is well done also, from the aging mage Pendragon, to Iraj the evil sorcerer, to Kalden, Faren's foster brother, and the number of other key players. There are also a couple shockers of plot twists involving some of these people that come into play in the story, though for this reader, it is hard to believe that one of those mysteries was not solved by our lead characters earlier on. In spite of that one minor factor that seemed it should have been obvious; this is a delightful story that is a fast, exciting read one will hate to put down even for a minute. Readers will eagerly await more vivid tales from the mind of Ms. D'Arcy.    © Kelley A. Hartsell, December 2004. All rights reserved.	2005-08-30

Fourteen years ago he was a young man full of purpose, longing to help others by wanting to become a priest. Then for some reason unknown to all but him, he returns home to his family as a new man - unhappy, quiet, no longer wanting to be in the Church. No one understood why until a young girl appeared on their doorstep.<br /><br />Nicole Houston has lived a life no child should ever experience. Dumped at a Church as a baby, unwanted and unloved, her life never improved. She ended up in Vegas working as a stripper at the tender age of sixteen. Then one night of love with a man bound for the Priesthood set her on a new path... as a mother.<br /><br />When Rayne Houston discovers her mother had kept her from her father for thirteen years by saying he was dead, she's furious. With only a young orphan called \\"The Timinator\\" as her companion, she takes off cross-country to find her father in The Daddy Quest. When she arrives at the Luchetti home, secrets are revealed and shocks abound. Though her running away temporarily reunited her parents, is it enough to convince them both that one man's sin is another person's salvation?<br /><br />When the Luchetti family was introduced in The Farmer's Wife, readers knew there were stories to tell for these five brothers. This story is the first of the mini series, though not the first read by this reviewer. As always, Lori Handeland pens an emotional tale that will keep one turning those pages until the last one is reached. The plot is strong, and the secondary story lines presented only add to the whole story.<br /><br />Aaron and Nicole are meant for each other, though it takes them a while to figure that out. Nicole's whole life is her daughter and her best friend at the halfway house where she turned her life around. When she discovers the gift given her in the form of her pregnancy, she is afraid to let Aaron know, for she doesn't want to ruin his life. Sacrificing her desires for the good of others, makes her much more like Aaron then she'd have thought. Aaron is torn over what he considers his failure to God and lives with the guilt every day of his life. Learning he is a father helps him realize what has been missing in his life.<br /><br />Readers will love the side stories and secondary characters found in this book. This reviewer was especially taken with \\"The Timinator\\" and found herself laughing out loud sometimes and getting teary eyed over the plight of this wonderful child. Readers will be longing for his happy ending as much as they hope for Aaron's and Nicole's. Rayne is a wonderful child, wise for her years due to the life she lives with her mother. It will amaze one to see just how much she knows about the world, though she never loses the innocence all children should have for as long as possible. Hints are given to the personalities of the other brothers in the family, and readers will find themselves eager to spend more time with the wonderful Luchetti clan.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />This latest in the Dark saga by Christine Feehan opens new doors on her world that will intrigue and entice.<br /><br />Colby Jansen loved her step father, Armando Chevez, dearly. When he died she was crushed, but swore to keep their ranch going strong for her brother and sister as it was to be their legacy. Strange accidents keep happening at the ranch that have her worried since she is already struggling to keep it alive. The final straw comes though, in the form of a visit from the Chevez brothers, Paul and Ginny's uncles, saying they want custody of the children to take them back to Brazil.<br /><br />Rafael De La Cruz is of an ancient race, sent to South America centuries ago with his four brothers, to protect their Carpathian people, and their prince, safe from the evil vampire. He is extremely close to turning vampire himself, when he journeys to the US with Juan and Julio Chevez, loyal human servants of his family, to aid them in bringing back their niece and nephew. He never expected to find his lifemate, the one woman who can prevent him from turning vampire on this journey.<br /><br />Colby and Rafael are attracted immediately, though she despises him for his role in trying to take away her beloved siblings. He realizes she is his lifemate immediately and can do nothing but protect her by trying to help her get to the bottom of the strange happenings at her ranch. Sparks fly and mutual respect grows, but when a very powerful vampire turns up and tries to claim Colby for himself, can the two of them come together in time to protect Colby's family and their ranch?<br /><br />This reviewer feels this story is back up to par with Ms. Feehan's other books in the saga, after having been disappointed in the previous full-length book in the series. The action is intense and never ending, sucking readers under its spell, keeping them reading long into the night, eager to see what will happen next. There are also some new plot threads woven into the world of the Carpathians, which sound fascinating and are sure to come into play in later books in the series. The romance between Colby and Rafael is extremely hot and passionate, luring readers into seduction right along with Colby.<br /><br />Colby is quite the heroine, strong willed, with a fiery temper to match her red hair. Her life is her family and she will stand for no one stepping in and trying to take them away from her, or telling her how to run her ranch and her own life. She is stubborn and determined... more then an equal match for the domineering Rafael. He has lived centuries, defending his family, his people, his prince from evil and he knows nothing of tenderness and patience. Finding his lifemate when he is on the brink of turning evil himself, makes him darker and more dangerous then previous heroes in the Dark saga. He has no time to cater to Colby's need for space to come to terms with what will be her new life, yet he holds out converting her as long as he can, knowing that each day he does not bind her brings him one step closer to eternal damnation as a vampire.<br /><br />There are numerous characters in this story, possibly more secondary players then most preceding books. Paul and Ginny, Colby's half-siblings are loveable and kind, showing a more tender kind of love... that of one for family. They are key to understanding Colby's personality as her entire life revolves around them. The vampire is malicious and cruel, extremely powerful... possibly the strongest readers have yet met. Juan and Julio, the Chevez brothers start out mysterious and suspicious, but readers come to trust them along with Colby and company. A few characters from previous books return once more adding more depth to this story, and preparing readers for their own which are surely soon to come. Also, some new people are introduced that are deeply mysterious and guaranteed to make one wonder just what their story is.<br /><br />Readersare bound to be captivated by Dark Secret by Christine Feehan. This story will please fans of the series, be they old or new, and leave them hungry for more.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, January 2005.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />Melinda Rucker Haynes' highly acclaimed Trust saga concludes with Essence of Trust, the final book in the trilogy.<br /><br />This book picks up some years after Breach of Trust, after two legendary Samurai swords have disappeared and changed the lives of five incredible people, among others. Mike and Dorel Gabrielli's son Marty is now at the cusp of manhood, and only beginning to come into the powers he has inherited through multiple lifetimes, one of which was Dorel's beloved grandfather. Rian Farsante and Jonathan \\"Spence\\" Spencer, soulmates who are loyal friends to the Gabriellis have been torn apart by Spence's lust for power which has led him to use his abilities for the dark side. All of them have been affected by the power infused in any wielder of the swords, their lives irreparably changed.<br /><br />Ancient legend, dating far back in Egyptian history, if not farther, speaks of the coming of the One, a powerful Essence that will control the world. Whether that control is used to destroy or to heal the world as we know it remains to be determined. Ian Stoddard, an extremely strong psychic spy for whom Mike, Spence, and Rian all worked with at one time, believes Marty to be the One, and seeks to use Marty's powers to take over the world. Time is running out as all players, good or bad, race to defeat an evil stronger than any of them can imagine; that is at the beginning, the very heart of the mystery of the swords. Can all of them find their destiny and use their powers for what they are meant to before this evil consumes them, possibly even costing some their current life?<br /><br />As with the previous two books in the saga, the story line is very complex due to the very nature of its reincarnation plotline. However, in this book, less focus is placed on past lives, though they do have an integral role, with the focus this time being on the here and now... and what is to come. One will find this book is not one to be rushed through, but is meant to be savored and read slowly so as to grasp the true meaning of the story and the symbolic nature of so many things, or people, found within. Many questions will be answered, and yet a few are left hanging, perhaps for effect, or something more? Readers must pick up this book for themselves to make that determination. Also be forewarned, there are multiple, totally shocking, plot twists that will make readers gasp aloud in disbelief and shout \\"that can't happen that way!\\"<br /><br />The previous two stories were more of an action tale, with an underlying love story. Though the undercurrent of a love story is evident here, it is not as strong as in the previous two stories, in this reviewer's opinion, but it is most definitely there. There are actually several different kinds of love, to include romance, experienced by the characters, which makes this an even more powerful story then the previous two. Readers will feel Rian's pain as she watches her beloved Spence fall deeper into the dark arts, knowing there is not much she can do to help him. A familial kind of love is evident here as well, between the Gabriellis and Rian and Spence. Marty, though showing the typical behavior of a young boy his age, also has an underlying wisdom of the ages, that will amaze and captivate readers, making them wonder how he knows so much for one so young. How everyone comes together in the paths Destiny has chosen for them will engross the reader right through to the very last page of the book.<br /><br />Essence of Trust indeed ends this chapter in a strong saga, but ends it in such a way to give one hope that maybe, just maybe, if destiny is kind, we may at some future date get to cross our paths with those friends... and enemies... found between these pages. Only the fates know for certain.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, April 2005.

Gwynnhwyfar has just been wed via a \\"glove\\" marriage to a man she doesn't want. Unfortunately, it is the only way to protect her father from a greedy neighboring landowner, and save herself from being forced to marry that same man. Upon arrival at the faraway land of her new husband, she finds her marriage to be far from a dream come true. With only her trusted maidservant and an old friend in service to her new husband, whom she loved with all the passion of her girlhood, she sets out to make the best of a bad situation, with a lot of magical help.<br /><br />This story is a look marriage in olden times and how little power women had but with the twist of powerful magic added to it. Gwynn is a proud young woman, brave and loving, who will do anything to protect those she loves, even if it means sacrificing herself. The twist at the end of the story will surprise readers, as it is quite unexpected. One especially interesting aspect of this story is that the beginning and ending of the story are told from the point of view of a crow that just happens to be there. Reading about the humans from the perspective of a scavenger bird, puts a different spin on the tale.<br /><br />Next up in this trio of stories is Drusilla's Dream by Rachel Lee. Drusilla Morgan is a data entry tech on graveyard shift at GalaxyCom who passes the monotony at work by spinning daydreams in her mind. In this particular fantasy she is a princess on a quest to find a magical key that will save her kingdom from destruction. Along the way she meets up with an animal tamer who surprisingly enough resembles Miles Kennedy, night time computer security, who is responsible for keeping all the computers running smoothly. What happens when these two get together, even if only in her imagination? Or is it only a dream?<br /><br />This reviewer feels this was the weakest story of the collection. The premise is interesting, having the entire story take place as a daydream, with occasional interruptions from real life. Unfortunately it fell flat. Some parts of the daydream came across as being clich&eacute;d, with a little bit of everything one would expect in a fantasy all just thrown in to add to the story. Some parts were quite original though, such as the master of the rivers, which add something extra to the novella. Also, the ending was unique, in how our hero and heroine are brought together. Yet it just didn't quite come together for this particular reader.<br /><br />The final story in this book is Moonglow by Catherine Asaro. Iris Larkspur is a young mountain girl who was born with powerful mage abilities. When Della No-Cozen, Head Mage to the Royal family, discovers her no one expected what was to come. Iris has not been able to grasp how to cast spells for her power comes from a different place than most mages. Once she finds the key to her magic, her life is irrevocably changed when she is betrothed to the heir to the throne of Aronsdale. However, Prince Jarid is a tortured young man, captured in a prison of his own making as a result of something he did as a young boy. Will Iris' magic... and their love... be enough to free him once and for all?<br /><br />This story takes place in the same world as Ms. Asaro's The Charmed Sphere. What is especially enjoyable is that this story actually takes place at the same time as some key parts of the full-length novel. Those who have read both stories will enjoy seeing some of the exact same scenes through different points of view. This story in itself is not especially deep. Had this reviewer not already read the other book, Moonglow would likely have left her feeling unfulfilled. Iris and Jarid are fascinating characters, flawed in many ways and having doubts in themselves. It was enjoyable to get a more in depth look at them. The magical land of Aronsdale is a wonderful place to visit, with an extremely distinctive kind of power.<br /><br />If readers are looking for a brief escape from reality and an adventure in another world, these stories will fit the bill quite nicely. Each one is different, written in different styles, but all sharing the common factor of magic in another land.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, August 2005.

Courtesy of The Best Reviews<br /><br />Hunter's Moon by C T Adams and Cathy Clamp is a fascinating look inside the world of shape shifters, and what happens when they fall in love with mere humans.<br /><br />Tony Giodone is the go-to guy for the Family, the Mafia, whenever they want someone dead. He's a hit man who also just happens to be a werewolf, newly initiated into the shape shifters' world. However, his new lifestyle surprisingly does not interfere all too much with his choice of employment, and actually helps him in some ways. Never did he expect that a routine job would change his way of thinking... permanently.<br /><br />Sue Quentin is on a mission, one that is unexpected for a person in her position. As if her introduction in to the story isn't enough, she is searching for someone to assassinate her for surprising reasons. Her life has ever been one of misery, any glimmer of happiness dampened by her greedy and domineering family. Winning the lottery should mean her freedom, but it only means a stronger prison for her.<br /><br />Tony feels something unexpected for Sue when he first meets her, making him wonder why she feels death is the only way out for her. As her story unfolds, he is amazed by it, even more so when he tries to chase her away when he feels the tug of the moon is too strong to fight. He is even more surprised to find she stays with him through it all, not at all surprised by his unconventional new life. Feelings begin to develop between them in spite of the barriers, but when enemies of Tony make Sue their next target, will these new tender emotions be enough to pull them through? Then there is the nagging fact that Sue wants to die...<br /><br />Wow!!! This is a fabulous story that will captivate readers from the very first sentence. Whoever would have thought that mixing the Mafia, shape shifters, and lottery winners with a death wish would make for such a compelling read? This story is gritty and raw, fast-paced and action-packed, with undercurrents of love of many kinds. It is a refreshing change on the typical werewolf story, building and expounding on a new world of shape shifters, where no one is quite what they seem. The first-person narrative style used here adds dimension as well, getting deep inside the mind of Tony, and how he reacts to the world around him. Some interesting plot twists will shock readers as they progress through the story, making them really wonder how this tale will flow.<br /><br />This reviewer especially liked the use of the sense of smell to describe what is going on, with emotions having a varied array of scents to refer to them. It works for this story though, for readers know that the sense of smell has much to do with how animals react to their surroundings, and it adds that animalistic quality that is often lacking in shape shifter stories. Too often, authors make their characters in animal form still react in humanistic ways, which takes away from the story, making it hard to believe that these people really are animals for a time.<br /><br />Sparks fly immediately upon Tony and Sue's meeting, adding an additional barrier to their plans. How can Tony kill his mark when he finds himself in love with her? And how could Sue possibly still want to die when she feels more alive in Tony's presence then she has in her entire life? Those doubts of the characters are given light in the story as well, and come to play throughout the story as they progress towards their entwined fates. The characters are numerous in this book, bringing a wide variety of personalities in to the mix, and providing a wide variety of opportunities for interaction and plot threads to follow.<br /><br />It is evident too, that the authors have a whole bevy of stories just waiting to be published, that will broaden the shape shifter world even more. This book made a fan of this reviewer, who now will be eagerly awaiting future stories from these talented up and coming authors.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, February 2005.

She's always had a habit of falling for the good looking, sexy, larger then life kind of men. When she goes to his office to pay him a surprise visit, she gets a surprise of her own, finding him in a very compromising position with his secretary. Now she's swearing of these kinds of men. She's decided the only way to find a good man is to try the \\"frogs,\\" the nerdy quiet types. Where does she go to find them? Well she starts canvassing what would be their natural environments - computer stores, libraries, hobby shops, etc.<br /><br />However, someone has other plans for Haley - her new neighbor Rick Samuels. He is the antithesis of what she is looking for - sexy as anything, sweet, charming, and a regular prince. He is just what she is not looking for... or is he? Rick has a few secrets he's keeping from her in light of her current quest. He's offended by the fact she stereotypes all men into one of two categories and sets out to prove that not everyone can be categorized. What neither of them expected was that they would be perfect for each other.<br /><br />This was a delightfully funny story. Having only discovered Natalie Stenzel's works in the past year, this reviewer became a fan immediately. The author has a refreshing voice in the romantic comedy genre. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, some of which are very slapstick.<br /><br />Haley is a sweet perky young woman who has been disappointed too many times in her choice of men. She's very ordinary in many ways, just like most people. She has a bright outlook on life, always giving of herself to others and hoping for the same in return. She always tries to see the good in people, until getting heart broken one too many times. Though this reviewer would probably never follow the same path as Haley did to try and find herself a new man, she can relate completely to Haley's feelings.<br /><br />Rick is a complete contradiction to Haley's views on men. He's a frog in disguise, if one buys in to Haley's categorizing. He was always the awkward one growing up but has overcome his insecurities to become the man he is today. He's proud of what he's made of himself and doesn't like Haley classifying him like she has. When these two got together, sparks started flying immediately, in spite of her denial of it all. Rick made it his mission to bring her around, knowing there was no one else for him. Watching these two do their own dance of courtship provides many humorous moments for readers.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, July 2005.

Due to her Native American heritage she has been selected to search for a powerful totem item belonging to the Eastern Cherokee. The fact she's recently been having disturbing dreams featuring that very item convince her that this mission is to be nothing like her others. When she finds out who her partner is to be, she is furious as she is still affected by something that happened several years ago.<br /><br />Chief Warrant Officer Griff Hutchinson has just transferred the jungles of Peru to work with the elite Black Jaguar squadron. His new mission appeals to him until he finds out who he is to be working with. Vickey has never forgiven him for an incident in flight school several years ago where Griff took part in a plot to get all of the women in the program expelled. The years have changed him though and he hopes to prove to her he is a different man. This mission to track down a crystal star seems like just what he needs to prove himself to her.<br /><br />Danger abounds around every corner though as they must battle the employees of Robert Marston, who will do anything to get the prized item to their boss. Vickey and Griff must put their past behind them if they hope to win this battle.<br /><br />This is the second story in the Sisters of the Ark trilogy by Ms. McKenna. As with the first one it is satisfactory, but nothing extraordinary. The lot is sound and interesting, using Native American beliefs and magic to develop and progress the plot. Readers will enjoy the glimpse in to that way of life, and will find many details from which to learn. While the books are stand alone, there are a few references to the first book to help readers know what is going on, but not enough to make the story hard to follow if reading just this one.<br /><br />Readers also get a chance to visit briefly with the hero and heroine from the preceding novel. New characters are introduced in addition to Vickey and Griff to advance the story and give another look at the personalities of the lead characters. The added tension of their past history provides for the conflict between them. However, this reviewer felt that Vickey held on to her grudge far longer then she needed to, holding Griff responsible. The fact that she has progressed through the ranks even faster then he did, and the fact that she is his superior, should be enough of a slap in his face for her. Her constant complaints about what happened got old after a while. Also, she came across as trying to hard to be tough. If Vickey had called one more person \\"dude\\" this reviewer would have screamed and thrown the book against a wall. Griff is believable however, his remorse over the role he played in past events was quite evident. He had learned his lesson and that same lesson has followed him all throughout his military career.<br /><br />This reviewer does look forward to the final story in the trilogy, to see how the overall story pans out.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

Between the time she calls the police and they arrive, her dead man has disappeared.<br /><br />Zac Marshall is a detective with the Philadelphia Police Department, and is Markie's best friend... or was anyhow, until she blamed him for her ex-fianc&eacute; abandoning her at the altar on their supposed wedding day. What she doesn't know is the real reason Zac tried to talk her out of getting married.<br /><br />Zac is on the case to track down Markie's missing corpse, which provides many chances to get close to her, hopefully showing her how he feels, and just maybe helping her realize she loves him too.<br /><br />Only the delightful Ms. Jacobs can take a story about a dead body, combine it with a romance, and make it laugh out loud funny. Her humor is evident from the first paragraph and never lets up. The details used to enrich the story are vivid... so clear that the reader will wince when picturing the hideously ugly clothing of the dead man, grin over the escapades of Markie and company, and feel all the emotions of the colorful cast of characters.<br /><br />Markie is a strong woman who knows how to hold a grudge, fall in love, and get revenge. Zac is a tough guy exterior hiding a heart of gold. Add in some zany neighbors, a closet romance novel reading policeman, a gossipy hair dresser, and meddling mothers, and readers will fall in love with this author's work, if not already fans. So sit back, relax, and prepare to be thoroughly entertained by Holly Jacobs' Found and Lost. This one is guaranteed to please.<br /><br />This reviewer is one reader fan who never misses a story by the incomparable Holly Jacobs!<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, July 2004.

Julienne had been abandoned and though near death, with a dreadful daemon coming to life within her chest, she had an incredible will to live and find Morgan, her only hope of survival in the harsh world of Sclyd.<br /><br />Morgan had always scorned his birthright, turning his back on his magickal half after the death which caused the burning hatred between he and Xavier to be born. He believes Julienne is lost and cannot forgive himself for the tragic end which became her. Now he awakens his powers once more, knowing he'll need them in the coming battle which could spell the end of his world.<br /><br />Xavier has found the key to using the greatest of all magickal forces, and hopes to unlock the secrets of the Scrolls of Cachaen to claim that untold power, to regenerate himself, and to gain control of all three worlds: that of humans, that of Sclyd, and that of the spirit realm. Morgan and Julienne must find each other before it's too late, and use his powers and hers- soon- to- be- gained, to defeat Xavier and prevent the hell he intends to unleash. Time is against Julienne and Morgan, but will they achieve success before it is too late?<br /><br />Once again, Ms. McKenna welcomes readers into the world of her imagination, where magick reigns, both good and ill. She has created such vivid imagery that readers will be drawn into the scenery, from the beautiful forests of Danarra, to the twisted realm of the Cult of Ouroborous (the Dragon), to the underground caverns of Erabris. One will see it all, and feel the heat or chill so clearly that it is as if being present there.<br /><br />The magick found, both white and black, is so clear, so crisp, with rituals defined, that one will believe such things as described do in fact exist. The cult's evil is felt and experienced along with the fictional participants and it is almost expected that the powers unleashed can reach beyond the pages of the book to taint this world.<br /><br />Julienne and Morgan's relationships grows in this chapter of the saga, giving more understanding as to why they are drawn to one another, in spite of the huge emotional burdens and flaws they each carry. Julienne comes into her strengths more in this story, and her path to learning more about her legacy, and overcoming her past, will intrigue readers and make them long to know more about her. Morgan is more an antihero then hero, but readers will empathize with him, as they come to learn more about his reasons for turning to the vices he did. His whole desire in life is to overcome his corrupted history, to get past the sick things he learned at his father's knee. His twin sister Megwyn, is seen more in this story as well, and though her role is more behind the scenes here, it is evident that she will come into play much more in the third book in the series. One gets the feeling her ultimate showdown with Morgan will forever change their world, and determine if good or evil shall win the war.<br /><br />This story will be much better understood by people who have read the first story in the trilogy before this one, but it can stand alone as a separate book as well. In short, the progression of the saga is brilliantly continued, and will make fans, be they new or old, stand up and take notice of Ms. McKenna's talent, while awaiting the final, sure to be breathtaking chapter, in the series.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

The nightmares change, but they always predominantly feature a ghost baby's cry. She thought she had put all of that behind her, and is a happy mother to her young daughter, Kendra, in spite of her struggles to support them. Summer has arrived and Sara has plans for a long vacation at an isolated mountain cabin.<br /><br />Nat Sanderson is a rugged mountain man, and Sara's closest neighbor, who lives with the knowledge of mistakes made in his earlier days, which have altered him irrevocably. He escaped to his mountain apple orchard, trying to avoid people as much as possible. He never wants to get close to someone again, and risk making such a huge mistake again... until Sara and Kendra arrive, altering his chosen lifestyle and dragging him out of isolation.<br /><br />When accidents start to happen and the threat becomes real to Sara and Kendra, she begins to realize there may be something to those old bad feelings about the orphanage, and her nightmares. Nat must now overcome his past to put his old security skills back to work in order to protect them. He cannot have another grievous error like he did a few years ago, making him the recluse he became. As tensions escalate, and danger beckons to Sara, feelings grow between Nat and her. But can he overcome his past and can she overcome her terrors to become the couple they are truly meant to be?<br /><br />Ms. Wayne knows how to pack a wallop, figuratively and literally, into her stories. She weaves a suspenseful plot that will keep one engrossed through the end. Though the \\"whodunit\\" in this story is pretty easy to figure out, that is not the real mystery. What really fascinates is the secret of what exactly happened all those years ago at the orphanage, and just how much does Sara know?<br /><br />There are enough peaks and valleys in this story to provide a roller-coaster ride of emotions in the reader. One will feel fear with Sara as she realizes the imminent threat to her precious daughter, anger and disgust at the cruelty of the evil-doers in the story, and tender love as Nat and Sara realize their feelings for each other. One will never know what to expect next, and that makes this book all the more intriguing.<br /><br />Nat and Sara are perfect for each other. She is a strong woman, who has overcome much adversity in her life since leaving the orphanage at fifteen years of age. Yet, she still has her softer, more vulnerable side, as evidenced in her love for Kendra, and her fear over what will happen to her. Nat is a protector, though he has lost sight of that aspect of his personality as a result of tragedy, as well as having a tender, emotional side. He needs someone resilient enough to cope with this duality in his nature. The two complement each other well, providing strength where needed, yet also having their respective sensitive sides.<br /><br />Having read previous books by Ms. Wayne, this reviewer knew she'd be in for a treat with this one, and was most definitely not disappointed.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

She would often get visions of horrible crimes about to happen, and her latest shows a murder waiting to happen. So off she goes to Western Canada, and a guest ranch, where she suspects the crime is going to occur. She never expects that this trip will change her life irrevocably.<br /><br />Cal Taggart runs a guest ranch in western Canada and is struggling to make ends meet. This is further hampered by the fact his closest neighbor wants to buy up his land, as he has all the other ranches in the area, so he can sell it for higher profit. Cal had spent his entire life trying to live up to his father's expectations of him, and the pending failure of his ranch is just one more thing of which his father can disapprove.<br /><br />When Lauren and Cal meet, sparks begin to fly immediately. However, her doubts color her perception of him when she discovers the women she must save is his ex-wife, Marlena. Cal has been disillusioned by love and the last thing he wants is a new relationship. When accidents start happening around the ranch and danger beckons, Cal and Lauren must work together to keep his ranch safe... and his ex-wife as well. But how can Lauren explain why she is so worried about Marlena without him turning from her, unable to accept her gift? Can they overcome their doubts about themselves and each other to be happy together?<br /><br />Lauren and Cal are both imperfect people who are striving always to be the best that they can. Lauren only hopes to put her special talent of seeing events yet to happen to good use, helping those in her visions, never wanting anything for herself. Cal, a retired rodeo rider, only wants to be happy, and to prove to his demanding father that he is successful and not a failure. They need each other, as they are the perfect match. She can help him realize the only person he needs to please is himself. He can help her realize that it is acceptable to want to be happy doing things for herself. The rest of the colorful cast of characters add depth to the story, all being so well developed that they are not just two-dimensional plot fillers, but important in their own right to the story unfolding about Cal and Lauren.<br /><br />The plot is wonderfully done, and the mystery of \\"whodunit\\" is so well done that readers will be trying to solve the mystery right up to the heart-pounding climax. There are good nail-biting action scenes and tender moments of love and character growth. The suspense is well done, as is the sexual tension between Cal and Lauren. Readers will feel the emotions of the characters, from love to fear to anger to sadness. All of these factors combine to bring about a story that will keep one engrossed from the first page through the last.<br /><br />Ms. Wilson, Dorchester's 2003 \\"New Voice in Romance Winner\\" is most definitely an author to watch.

He and Matt, his brother, have many years of animosity and bad blood between them, but Barry vows to put that aside while he tries to figure out what happened. Shortly after getting home, Barry bumps into an old acquaintance, Jennifer Brand, who as a child had suffered from spina bifida, and to whom Barry had been horribly cruel. She is now apparently cured and a stunningly attractive young woman, and feelings grow between them.<br /><br />Barry and Jennifer's investigating, their biggest clue being \\"Lebo\\" written in blood on the wall, turns up frightening ties between Matt and a black magick coven leader, Ren, who wants an ancient evil power for himself. Jennifer is a student of magick as well, though not black magick, and must use her powers to stop Ren and his coven before they can succeed in their plans. What they find is that Matt, and now Jennifer and Barry, may play an unwilling part, a part in which someone will probably die. Which side will win the ultimate battle? And will the sacrifices made be enough to stop this evil from ever taking form again?<br /><br />This story is a chilling thriller, bound to keep readers on the edges of their seats, gasping in shock many times over. The descriptions of the destruction to Matt's house and of the rituals Ren uses are vivid, making readers shiver in revulsion and disgust at the defilement. Jennifer's magick is also well detailed, making the reader see what she is doing and creating to protect them. The final climactic battle scene is brilliantly done, putting one right in the center of the action, feeling the brutalities performed on Ren's victims.<br /><br />The relationships between the characters are well developed as well. One can feel and even understand why the relationship between Barry and Matt has always been so tense. They have grown much since then however, and it can be felt how much they've changed and how that will affect their new growing relationship. Jennifer is depicted as a complex young woman, who has her faults and flaws, but also has her strengths. The relationship that develops between she and Barry is beautiful and strong, built on what would not have been thought to be common ground when they were younger.<br /><br />If readers are looking for a compelling read, that will entice them in, making them eager to see how the story will end, then read this one. It's well written, with a strong plot and stronger characters. It is sure to tempt even the most particular of horror aficionados.

What no one, save her father and an old healer know, is that she lived through a terrifying act of brutality seven years previous... one, that were people to find out about, she'd be scorned by all. She had once been a happy young lady who went out of her way to extend kindness to others. That traumatic event changed her in such a way that she was an entirely different person.<br /><br />Ronan Fitzgerald is a roaming minstrel and healer who loves his lifestyle. He'd never be happy confined to one place all his life. When he made a promise to his dying mentor, he never realized how much that would change his life. When he headed to Aylsford Keep, all he had been told was to serve Lord Darnley and help Maude, with no idea of what that would entail.<br /><br />Ronan discovered, upon arrival at Aylsford, that he may be getting more then he bargained for. He knew nothing of what he would be doing or how to help. Upon meeting Maude, he knew something was different about this woman, and that underneath her harsh demeanor, she held some dreadful secret. He did what he could to help her, until she felt able to trust him with her secret horror. Now, they can begin the real work of her healing, out of which grows a tender love that turns to a fiery passion neither can deny. As the feud grows strong once again, can their love be enough to overcome treacheries of the past?<br /><br />Once again, Ms. English has proven her skill at weaving a complex story full of passion and adventure, with characters the reader will love. This reviewer was doubtful as to whether or not Maude could be redeemed enough to become a believable heroine, but as it turns out, there was no reason to wonder. Maude's portrayal is beautifully rendered, and the reader can't help but understand and feel for this emotionally scarred woman. It was also delightful to see Ronan finally get a story of his own, after the role he played in Laird of the Mist. These two people are fated to be together, for only then could they both reach their full potential.<br /><br /> Of course, as to be expected in a story by this author, the plot is rich and full of depth. It progresses at a good pace, and every character plays an important role in the tale. It was nice to see the heroes and heroines from the previous two stories in this series as well. They too, add to the story, and one never feels as though they were just added for the sake of a cameo or two.<br /><br />Emotions of every kind are brought into play. Readers will feel Maude's terror as she lives the horror of that fateful day, and her frustration when she tries to finally remember, but can't. There will be happiness as she comes into her own again, passion as Ronan and Maude discover their love, and finally peace when all is resolved and calm returns to the characters.<br /><br />One thing that this reviewer felt was never resolved was Maude's recurring dream and why she has it. It plays an integral, though minor part in some scenes, and Ronan tries to interpret it for her, telling her the reason for bringing it to its natural conclusion. Although the dream is finally fully realized, the final interpretation is never explained. This could be because Ms. English wanted the readers to put their own spin on it, but this one would have liked to hear it from the character's perspective, rather then her own.<br /><br />As always, this tale by Ms. English will satisfy readers. Hopefully, this is not the final story in the series, as there is yet potential for more beautiful romance to be found for assorted members of both the Darnley and Kirallen families. This is one fan who will keep coming back for more, as long as there are stories to tell.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, June 2004. All rights reserved.ter the role he played in Laird of the Mist.

Also, Ms. Feehan introduces a new kind of heroine, her first ever, female vampire hunter.<br /><br />Destiny is a rarity in the Carpathian world. She is a female vampire hunter, which before now was absolutely unheard of in their society. At a very young age, her family had been horrifically murdered by the hated vampire, and she was kidnapped, brutalized and converted by him. As a result, she has always felt alone in the world, soiled and ruined as a result of her experiences. Except for him...<br /><br />Nicolae is an ancient, sent out centuries ago to hunt the undead, the vampires, those of their race who lost all hope and turned to the bad as a result. He was on the brink of losing his hold in the world and turning himself, when a powerful connection to a young girl in agony saved him. He taught her everything he knew about hunting vampires, giving her the power and control she needed to keep herself alive and sane.<br /><br />Nicolae and Destiny finally come face to face when he finds her and rescues her from a vampire ambush. As a result of the tragedies she lived through as a child, Destiny trusts no one, especially Nicolae, whom she at first believes to be a vampire. He can do no other then protect her, his lifemate, as it is ingrained into all Carpathian men from birth. When it becomes apparent that Destiny's town is about to become a battlefield between Carpathians and vampires, Destiny and Nicole have to fight what could very well be a fight to the death, to rescue the people they have come to love. Will they succeed and will Destiny finally be able to overcome her past?<br /><br />This story is different then the previous books in the series, with a darker feel. Destiny is mentally and physically scarred from her conversion by a vampire and her battles to destroy them. She believes she is unclean, contaminated, and will never be good enough for her kind. Nicolae has always been powerful and never loses a battle. It tears him up inside that he can't help Destiny win her emotional battles, or take them upon himself and spare her the misery. Though it contradicts his very nature, he knows what she needs to be whole again.<br /><br />As always, the author expands on the world she has created, introducing new aspects previously unknown to readers. There are even a few sideline stories, which will interest, and maybe even answer a few questions, fans have long wondered about. One will experience many different emotions while reading, from tears of happiness to tears of sorrow, pleasure and pain, anger and joy. One will also love to see new characters who may later get their own stories?, as well as some returning favorites.<br /><br />However, for this reviewer, in spite of some appealing details and plot lines, this story just did not captivate as previous books have done. There were a couple sub-plots, which felt unnecessary to the story, though their intended purpose was evident. It just seems the reasons for them could have been handled in another way through the main story line. It felt like this particular sub-plot could have been completely removed and the story would have been no worse off for it. Also, some of the new details and vivid descriptions of some aspects of Destiny's conversion and subsequent suffering were too unbelievable for this reviewer to fully appreciate them.<br /><br />One other thing about this story which didn't sit well with this reviewer, was some of the writing itself. There were so many sentence fragments and one-word sentences through the entire book that it became very distracting. Whether this is a new situation or an old one that was not really noticed before, or just the need for more editing, it took away from the story. It is apparent that this writing style was used for a reason, possibly to give the feel of stream-of-consciousness and thoughts ofthe characters. Where this worked fine for the dialogue and for the internal thinking and conversing of the characters as it suited how they'd be thinking, it just did not work at all for the narrative portions of the story.<br /><br />All in all, a passable story for the series, and likely it was just a \\"bump in the road\\" for the author, with future books to be back to what one has come to expect from a story by Ms. Feehan.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

Well, this is a fun story for anyone who has ever felt that way before.<br /><br />Dylan Stone is the only one of her circle of friends not out to find true love, based on the size of the diamond she can receive. Sure, she wants romance with a wonderful man and happy-ever after and all that, but she's in no hurry, as she wants to be sure he's The One before she gets the rock on her finger.<br /><br />However, after numerous weddings in one year, she begins to wonder if she'll ever find the special someone to give herself to, figuratively and literally. At one of the many weddings she has attended, she is rescued from the overly drunk and amorous father of the groom, by one of the finest specimens of man she has ever seen.<br /><br />Brad Davis is the ultimate perfection for Dylan. She'll never find another like him, should she search high and low. Things start out fairly well with them, but he is so busy getting his business off the ground and living his full life that there seems to be no way he can fit into hers. Or is there?<br /><br />Ms. Laine shows talent in this, her debut novel for Harlequin. She's got wit, charm, strong characters, and real life all piled up into one story that will provide laugh out loud moments for readers. This book is written in the style of the ever more popular Chick Lit. Dylan is typical of many young businesswomen in the world today, so busy chasing after her professional success that her personal life sometimes takes a back seat. Her life to date had been anything but conventional, but that adds to her uniqueness, which makes her appealing to the reader.<br /><br />One thing that is interesting about this story is that though it is a romance, the majority of the story seems to focus more on Dylan and her friends and family then it does on her relationship with Brad. However, it makes for a more well rounded plot when all the interaction is brought into play. In fact, her non-romantic relationships are more appealing to this reviewer then her relationship with Brad. Where her family and friend relationships are zany and lively, her relationship with Brad is almost stale in comparison. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot between them, other then sexual attraction, for a good part of the book.<br /><br />One thing guaranteed to please though is that this story is full of wit and sarcasm, and humor of many kinds, though it has its serious moments as well. So, if one is looking for a cute story with lively characters to go with the romance, When Size Matters fits the bill. Ms. Laine has talent and plenty of skill, which will likely be developed in later books, allowing her to grow as an author.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, June 2004. All rights reserved.into play.

Her life revolves around her daughter, Emmi, and science, ever since her husband died. Emmi's greatest dream is for God to give her a new Daddy. Julia thinks her experiment is finally perfected, and when she tests it, is in for quite a surprise. Her equipment ends up capturing an angel! Emmi is thrilled, believing Joel is the answer to her prayers for a new daddy.<br /><br />Now, they must figure out what went wrong so they can fix it and return Joel to his proper existence before it is too late and he's trapped forever. However, neither expected that they'd capture each other's hearts in the process, and they must now make a decision that could change their lives for eternity.<br /><br />This was a pleasant story about \\"what ifs\\" and dreams come true, with a dose of inspirational thrown into the mix for good measure. Julia is lonely in her life, but doesn't realize it quite so much, believing it is full between her career, her daughter, and her few close friends. She had never truly loved her husband, so she isn't even quite aware of what she's missing in that respect. Joel is full of confusion when he is yanked out of his plane of existence, and sucked into Julia's world. He is also full of delight at the simplest of things, like the microwave, and excited over each new discovery he finds. Emmi is thrilled to have him in her life, convinced he was a gift to her from God, and prays daily he will stay forever, marry her mother, and be her daddy.<br /><br />As Julia works against time to figure out what went wrong so she can return Joel to his realm, all the while she's wishing he could stay with them. Their love and passion grow from the close relationship that forms as they try to crack the equations, and both long for something that should be forbidden to them. This story reminds readers there is always hope. Though sometimes not easily understood, there is a reason for everything and fate (and a Higher Power) has a way of working, no matter what is stacked against it. This reviewer enjoyed this story and hopes to see more from this author in the future.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, August 2004. All rights reserved.always hope.

Her heart had been broken as the result of a tragedy that only she and her boyfriend at the time, Brian Riley, knew about. When her father falls ill eight years later, she comes home to see him. Everyone wants to know why she left everything behind but she can't bring herself to reveal their secret.<br /><br />Brian has always loved Kim, in spite of the hurt and anger he feels and her having abandoned him when he needed her most. When she appears in the driveway of his farm, he is disbelieving and in his shock, tumbles off the barn roof breaking both of his wrists. Kim's guilt over their heartbreak, and his current situation, makes her decide to do the right thing and stay to help him until he is healed.<br /><br />Their love has never died, even after what happened so many years ago, and being in such close quarters brings all those memories to the surface. Can they finally talk about what happened and help each other heal? Or is that one heartrending event going to keep them apart forever?<br /><br />This is a beautiful story about two young people who made some mistakes in their past that still affect them to this day. Kim and Brian were so in love in their younger days, that they never thought anything could ever hurt them. As is always found in the fearlessness of youth, they believed they were indestructible. However, their past affected them more than they realize.<br /><br />Kim has become a woman who believes love is nothing but pain, and she attempted to drown that in alcohol and men. But the emptiness remains. Brian feels like a failure because he could not make her stay back then. Both are still so blinded by their hurt and loss that they can't see the truth before their eyes... that the love they share can see them through anything. This comes through in the writing, having caused this reviewer to become teary-eyed on more then one occasion.<br /><br />The growth of the characters in this book is well done, with the readers being able to understand what drives them. The interaction between Kim and her family is realistic and true to the nature of large families. There is even a sweet secondary love story here, that of Kim's parents, as they learn once again why they love each other and they learn to handle the changes in their relationship. Tantalizing glimpses of the Luchetti Brothers are given throughout, preparing readers for the stories to come about each of them.<br /><br />Having only read Ms. Handeland's paranormal romances in the past, this book gave the reviewer a better realization of the author's talent for penning emotional stories that grasp readers from beginning to end. This reviewer looks forward to reading the rest of the series that has started with `The Farmer's Wife'.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, September 2004.

She needs something fast to bring in money to rescue it. Never did she imagine that finding an old Italian cookbook would summon aid from the great Goddess of the Harvest, Demeter.<br /><br />When the Goddess makes a proposition, Lina listens. She is to exchange places with Persephone, the Goddess of Spring, for six months. Persephone will assume Lina's life for that time, in order to rescue the bakery, and Lina will go to the Underworld to bring hope and new \\"life\\" to the spirits.<br /><br />Never did Lina dream that doing so would change her forever, when she meets... and falls in love with... the God Hades, Death personified.<br /><br />What a fantastic, magical tale this is! Here is a delightful story full of life and love that brings the incredible world of Gods and Goddesses out of the realm of mythology and into the real world for readers to enjoy. Here, one will find a brilliant and unique story of soul mates united, love found, and the passions of the Immortal.<br /><br />Lina is a middle-aged woman, beautiful inside and out, who has long since given dreams of love. Hades is a powerful, sexy, handsome Immortal who is one of a kind and never imagined someone could love him and his realm. These two need each other in order to be whole. There is a full cast of characters to round out the story. Readers will enjoy the second love story entwined here, of Eurydice and Iapis, spirit and daimon. Persephone, though a more minor role, adds youthful vitality, and her mother Demeter adds a touch of awe, to captivate readers.<br /><br />The imagery is vivid and one will see the beauty of the Underworld... from the joy and light of Elysia, to the darkness and despair of Tartarus. Hades' palace is incredibly portrayed as well, even the \\"Dread Steeds of Hades.\\"<br /><br />Though Goddess of Spring was the first book by Ms. Cast this reviewer has read, it intrigued enough to insure it will most definitely not be the last. This is one new fan who eagerly awaits the next story in the series!<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, August 2004.

She pretty much raised her brothers after her parents died and now that they had finished school, she is free to live her own dreams. The only problem is she's not sure what those dreams are. Her job as a receptionist at the Wagner, McDuffy, Chambers, and Donovan Law Firm pays the bills and she is quite happy there, well except for one very handsome annoyance that is. That's okay though, the dislike was mutual.<br /><br />Larry \\"Mac\\" Mackenzie is a good lawyer, a good man and a good volunteer in the community. The only thing really missing in his life was family. His parents were never around and he went from foster place to foster place, until his best friend's parents took him in as one of their own. He never really felt like he belonged, and he swears he will never have children as he never wants to do that to them. However, when a client asked him months ago to be the guardian of her then unborn child, he agreed, though he never expected anything to come of it. Until the day, he inherits her child.<br /><br />Little Katie O'Keefe is a darling baby, and Mac agrees to care for her until he can find her a loving home... a home like he never had. Unfortunately, he knows nothing about raising children and gets a lot more then he bargained for in taking on this responsibility. Mia agrees to help him out and things change. The more time they spend together, the more they decide maybe they don't dislike each other after all, but actually care about each other. Their love for Katie unites them in a way they never imagined, and their own love for one another grows. However, how can Mac love Mia and be there for her the way she needs when he can't even do that for such a beautiful baby?<br /><br />This is another charismatic novel by Ms. Jacobs, full of personality and life. One will find plenty of the trademark humor expected in her stories.  However, at the same time, Ms Jacobs touches on some very tender emotions, which will bring a tear to the reader's eye as Mac learns some very important lessons about life, love, and the true meaning of family. It's not what he is born in to, but what he makes for himself, and genetic bonds are not always required to be a real family.<br /><br />The mutual attraction between Mia and Mac is evident from their introductions in the book. They may not know it, but readers will recognize that their sniping, griping, and that their arguing with each other is just a cover up, since they refuse to acknowledge their real feelings for one another. These two need each other... Mia needs Mac to help her realize its okay to reach for her dreams now, and he needs her to show him what it really means to be a family. Katie's entry into their world gives them a way to be there for one another, through their mutual love for her.<br /><br />Readers will delight in the opportunity to visit again with a few of the other residents of Perry Square, and meet some new ones as well. Moreover, who can forget the lively Zumigalas who cared for Mac, the parents of his best friend? They are a wonderful family, full of love for each other, and for Mac and those who enter in to his life. Some of the most touching scenes in the whole story revolve around them.

In her world, there is no such thing as love or magic, only money and assets. When her latest in a string of rich elderly husband dies, she finds out she doesn't have a penny to her name... only an old inn in South Fork, Arkansas.<br /><br />Evan Luchetti is his family's ladies man. He has always been the brother all the women were crazy about, and he has more notches in his bedpost than most men his age. But when his latest relationship goes south after he proposes, he decides he is tired of the life he had been living, and goes to make a new one in Arkansas. There he takes a job restoring an old inn that is rumored to be haunted.<br /><br />When Jilly arrives at the inn, shocking Evan when she tells him she's the owner, and wants a partnership to restore it and sell it, they settle on a fair deal. Neither expected the attraction they'd feel for one another, but can't act on. Jilly needs to go about the business of finding her next rich husband, and Evan has decided there will be no more sex for him without love. What they didn't know was that they would find exactly what they needed... in each other.<br /><br />Once again readers get to spend time with some beloved characters, old and new. Evan has always been a playboy, but has grown tired of the reputation. His decision to change his ways was a long time coming, but gives him the chance to grow as a person. Readers of the past Luchetti Brothers books always knew there was more to him than was on the surface, and this story shows it. Jilly, on the surface, seems shallow, but once readers get to know her, they can understand and even sympathize to some extent with the reasons she chose the life she did. Both Evan and Jilly turn out to be much deeper, richer individuals than anyone had ever given them credit for. They just needed the right atmosphere for that to show.<br /><br />There is a wonderful cast of characters found in South Fork, from the local wise woman, Addie, to the bachelor Seitz Brothers, Larry, Barry and Jerry, to the superstitious Wilder sisters, Naomi and Ruth. Add in a menagerie of animals encompassing everything from a toothless alligator to an ancient horse, and a few ghosts, and the delightful mix will engage readers from beginning to end. Readers get a chance to visit with some beloved Luchettis from previous books as well.<br /><br />As always, Ms. Handeland has penned a rich story, full of plot and emotion, that will more than satisfy readers, be they old fans or new. This reviewer got a few chuckles out of the escapades of the animals, as well as a few tears over some more emotional scenes in the story.

Fresh out of school, she gets hired to work on a groundbreaking project, the Living Lens, otherwise known as the Epi Project, which takes donor corneas in eye surgery as surgical implants for improving eye-sight, like a permanent contact lens. She jumps in to the job full tilt, ready to make a difference on the project, for her supervisor.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one of her first discoveries is poor record keeping for patient records, and billing. She takes her concerns to Dr Byron Rutherford, the lead in the project but he says not to worry and to do whatever she needs to fix the problem. However, the more she looks, the more problems she finds. She discovers there is a lot more to this than bad records and failed grafts.<br /><br />With the help of her lawyer boyfriend Charles Carter, and her late husband's best friend Dr. Scott Fontenot, she uncovers more then she bargained for. They find serious problems, ranging from money laundering and fraud to \\"the body Mafia,\\" which is implicated in illegal trafficking of body parts. Now her life is in danger, as are those of her friends, and everyone involved in helping her uncover the extent of the illegalities of the Epi Project. Will she get to the bottom of it and get enough evidence to convict involved parties before she gets killed?<br /><br />Wow! What a ride this story is! It is an adventure from the first page to the last. The opening prologue sets the tone for what is to follow, immediately giving readers a sense of the risks Jeannette will be taking throughout the story. The storyline progresses gradually at first, slowly leading up to the heart of the plot, then steamrolls through from there. This book takes numerous twists and turns weaving back and forth and doubling back on itself, just like the snakes and lizards living in the Louisiana bayou.<br /><br />A few different storylines all interrelated, but slightly apart from one another, are seamlessly interwoven to give the overall picture and just how much is at stake for Jeannette, her family and friends. There is also an undercurrent of love stories to be found, which adds another level of richness to the plot. But don't misunderstand, there is love and romance in the story, but this is most definitely not a romance novel, the primary focus being on the mystery.<br /><br />Having read other works by Ms. Michaels, this reviewer knew what to expect in writing style, but this was a whole new genre at which the author could try her pen. Ms. Michaels does not disappoint in the mystery genre either. Her trademark of rich storylines with strong plots is very evident here. This is just one more reminder of why she is fast becoming a favorite author for this reviewer.<br /><br />(...)itself, just like the snakes and lizards living in the Louisiana bayou.

She meets the khashim, her father, though that detail of her parentage is as yet unknown to her, and he takes her away to his palace to be a servant. He has ever loved her mother, though she is forbidden to him, and swears that though he cannot openly acknowledge his daughter, he will ensure that she has a good life and never wants for anything.<br /><br />Jashemi-kha-Tahmu, son and heir to his father's legacy, knows immediately Kevla is his sister. He may not be able to publicly recognize her as his blood relation, but he strikes up an illicit friendship with her that sets in motion a chain of events foreshadowed centuries ago, in the wake of great danger.<br /><br />A powerful force, the looming Shadow, is upon the land of Arukan, and Kevla is the only one who can control the forces necessary to stop it. With Jashemi's help, she must remember her true heritage and enter the lair of the Great Dragon to find strength and be reborn in its flames. Thus begins the greatest battle of good vs. evil any of them have ever known.<br /><br />Ms. Golden begins a powerful story with this novel. Her vivid prose details a grand world of desert sands and fiery mountains, a world the reader will fall in to and envision as if there with the characters. One will truly see the caverns of the Great House, the fantastic creatures, and of course, the fiery lair of the Great Dragon.<br /><br />Kevla is a young girl thrust into a life she never dreamed or hoped could be hers, only to have it snatched away again. However, that only serves to open her to an even greater fate. When readers meet her, she is a shy, slightly frightened and very overwhelmed young girl, but grows strong in her new life. That gives her the ability to use, if not understand at first, the mystical powers she wields, all leading her to become the powerful woman she was meant to be, born anew On Fire's Wings. Her growth of character is central to the story, for without her there is no story.<br /><br />This story will fascinate and intrigue readers, leaving them breathlessly awaiting the next fantasy in this new saga.

She was engaged to someone she worked with at her father's company, and was all set to get married. Until she found out that he had a deal with her father - she gets a husband and her husband gets a corner office! Thoroughly humiliated at the thought of being \\"bought and paid for,\\" she breaks it off, quits her job, and takes a solo trip to Las Vegas for an adventure.<br /><br />Josh Walker also works with Marley, and happens to be the reason she found out about Larry, her now ex, and his deal with her Dad. He feels slightly guilty about what happened, but is relieved at the same time that she got out of that bad situation, even if it meant she walked into a new one by taking off for Vegas, alone.<br /><br />Marley has a wild time in Vegas, living it up and finally giving her hidden wild side a chance to show. And shine she does, waking up in the morning not remembering much about the previous night, and what's this? She has a nice shiny diamond on her hand? She got married? She is even more shocked to find out just who she got married to... none other then her nemesis Josh! What follows are many hilarious moments, and could it be.... Love?<br /><br />Marley is a modern woman, who though on the surface seems prim and proper and all business, is really an adventurous woman who has just been stifled and needs a chance to break free again. When she finally gets the chance to let loose, she decides she likes the new Marley and is not quite ready to give that up. Seeing Marley's growth from all business and afraid to have fun, into the woman who is proud of who she is and willing to take some risks, especially in love, was a fun ride and one that may make readers realize they can be more than they are.<br /><br />There were plenty of interesting plot threads in the book as well. When one finds out the real reason Josh is so worried about Marley, it is intriguing enough to keep one reading on to see how everything resolves itself. When Marley finds this out as well, readers will really get a chance to see the new woman she has become, and will be cheering her on in her new attitude and strength.

She had witnessed some very disturbing events that put her life in danger. Believed to have been betrayed by her husband and his best friend Jonas, she runs, taking with her only three religious amulets and a lion cub, Thor, one of the Guardians of the island, who has abilities beyond human comprehension. After giving Michael, her husband, one chance to prove his innocence, and he seemingly betrays her even more, she has put that life behind her and has been on the run ever since.<br /><br />Several years later, Christine is alive and well in a small Cape Cod town. She had faked her death shortly after arriving there, hoping to throw those after her off her trail. She now lives under an assumed name, with the daughter of she and her husband, and Thor. Michael had just found out about her death, heading to the town of Farewell, to say his to his wife, only to bump into her in the flesh, with the daughter he never knew he had.<br /><br />Now the real adventure begins. Michael does not understand why Christine left him all those years ago, nor why she seems to hate him upon finding each other again. Slowly the story comes out, and Michael realizes he had been used in a game he can't believe, one conducted by his best friend. When he unknowingly puts Christine and their daughter Kayla in danger, they have to work together to solve the mystery of why those amulets are so important to Jonas, and why he will stop at nothing to retrieve them. Through it all they learn their love has never died, but only grown stronger. But can they get beyond the hurts of their past to build the life together they have always dreamed of?<br /><br />This is a suspenseful story that crosses land and water from Cape Cod to the Caribbean Islands. Christine is a remarkable woman to have overcome so much in her young life. She was not the strongest heroine in flashback scenes, but her ordeal shaped her into a force to be reckoned with. It sure doesn't hurt either that she has a huge wild cat as her constant companion. Michael is a confused man who just wanted his friend and wife to get along, the reason behind some of his less then stellar choices made, and can't understand why they don't just love each other. He is torn between his love of the woman he made wife before she vanished, and his loyalty to the friend he thought he could count on for anything. Though Michael is a powerful member of this story, the focus does seem to be on Christine and how she handled the curves fate had thrown her way.<br /><br />From the very first paragraph, the reader learns they are in for a treat. Ms. Anderson paints a vivid picture that one can't help but envision in the mind. Her descriptive passages are delightful and the action never stops throughout the entire book. There is plenty of mystery as Christine and Michael try to find the answers to what the amulets really can do, and what they mean to those after them.  And who can forget Thor, the loveable telepathic lion? He is a wild cat of extraordinary abilities, like all of his kind, who was bred for one reason... protect Santa Caribe and her native inhabitants, and never let the amulets of power fall into the wrong hands.<br /><br />Ms. Anderson has found a winning formula with this book, combining adventure, passion, mystery, and the paranormal into a story that will enthrall the readers, not releasing them from its spell until the final page is turned. This reviewer hopes this story is a sign of things to come from the talented author, and hopes just maybe to get to visit with some of these beloved characters again.

He has dedicated his life to hunting the undead, evil vampires, once Carpathians, who have chosen a life of evil and power. Traian was returning home to see his new Prince when he happened across a pack of vampires working together, incessantly searching for something unknown to him, that can only be incredible power, the only thing strong enough to make these usually solitary creatures join forces. He was severely injured in a battle with them, and was going away to heal when a vision of beauty, unlike anyone he had ever known, comes to him.<br />Joie Sanders is a self-employed bodyguard, selling her protection services to those in need. She is injured on the job, not for the first time, and uses her psychic abilities to astral project out of her body and away from the pain of her wounds plaguing her. While free and floating she ventures far, into the Carpathian Mountains, where she happens upon a beautiful ice cave and sees him.... One she thought but a dream.<br />Both are startled to find each other, Traian especially, when he sees color for the first time in hundreds of years, realizing she is his lifemate, the other half of his soul. As they both heal from their injuries, much time passes while they take advantage if their mind link, though Joie is convinced she is going crazy... hearing that voice in her head. When she is on a caving expedition, they meet in the flesh, him again being severely injured, trapped by the vampires, in a mysterious wizard's cave, where Traian is sure the answers sought by the evil ones can be found. Joie comes to his rescue, with the help of her brother, Jubal, and her sister, Gabrielle.<br />All is still not well though for Joie and Traian. While she adjusts, remarkably well, to being mate to such a wonder of a man - who is very old-fashioned - the vampires are still seeking their elusive answers, which Traian needs to prevent, as he is convinced only something able to grant unsurpassable power would be reason enough for vampires to unite. They are in a race against time... to prevent the vampires from finding their answers, all the while they lean what it is to be lifemates.<br />Ms. Feehan has written yet another gripping tale of passion in the incredible Dark saga. Joie is probably one of the most memorable heroines to date in this series, showing a fierce independence and strength of her own, as do all the heroines, but she just stands out in the memory banks, making her a more then perfect mate for one of the ancients, the strongest of the Carpathian race. Traian is the typical alpha male in most ways, his desire to protect his mate as strong as is normal for his kind, but with an understanding and respect for Joie's need to feel empowered and strong in her independence.<br />Also of note, Ms. Feehan expands her world even more, adding a fantastical element in the form of the wizards' world, complete with magical spells, curses, and dragons. She has added new factors, evidence that her world is far from being complete. As always, one will be captivated from the first paragraph, featuring the vivid battle of Traian vs. the band of evil undead. She holds the reader in her spell all the way through the final climactic scene resolving one storyline, but leaving another wide open, hopefully to be carried into future books in the series.<br />Those skeptics out there who claimed the Dark saga was getting old and stale are in for a surprise as that couldn't be farther from the truth. Ms. Feehan's voice is as fresh as ever, and with all the new elements to the saga being added in this story, the excitement is bound to continue for a long time coming.

In her home of Kaf, land of the djinn and other extraordinary magical beings, ma'at (magic) is highly prized with those unable to perform it well being considered outcasts and often scorned by the others. She has spent her life trying to cultivate what little ma'at she had, hoping to master it and become equal to her peers.<br /><br />Jack Montgomery is a scientist with a penchant for extreme sports, who hates anything that cannot be explained away by logic and facts. He hates magic of any kind, especially since his beloved sister went off and married a djinn from another land. He has spent months trying to find a way to master magic, putting it under his control, where he could stave off magic of any kind and he could always be in control. Finally he has created a talisman that will protect him from magic's power.<br /><br />When he happens across Leila one night in a bar, he is intrigued, especially when it appears she has set her sights on his person, in the hopes of getting the one thing she wanted almost as much as ma'at, a baby. Jack is fascinated with the exotic beauty, captivated by her allure and charm, and... her magic? Too late he realizes she has placed him under her spell, activating his charm to protect himself. Once the flashing lights and heat caused by the reaction of his talisman subside, he finds himself trapped... trapped in a land of people that survive because of the one thing he hates above all... magic.<br /><br />Not only have they been zapped to Kaf, but Leila's ma'at has been zapped as well, having been negated by the force of Jack's talisman. She is infuriated with him for stealing the one thing she needs above all, and he is infuriated with her for trying to seduce him with the magic he abhors. Trapped in the hostile Tower Lands of Kaf, they must venture to the home of his sister Isis and her husband, ruler of the djinn, convinced he is the only one who can undo the wrongs and send Jack home.<br /><br />Danger lurks around every corner and in every crevice in this seemingly barren world, and when an evil djinn decides he wants Jack's power for his own, even more hurdles have to be overcome along the way.  But through it all, through the dangerous trek across inhospitable land, Jack and Leila can't resist the allure of each other. Now Jack finds himself in an even greater danger then succumbing to the ma'at he hates.... He finds himself in the thrall of an even greater Enchantment, that of his love for the mystical beauty.<br /><br />This being the reviewer's first Kathleen Nance novel, it won't be the last. It was a pleasurable welcome to the world of Kaf and ma'at. The characters are charming and a joy to meet. Jack is a strong man of virtue and intelligence, who was permanently scarred, literally and figuratively, by a single traumatic event of his childhood. Leila has always been an outcast, using her wits and what few skills she possessed when her ma'at failed her. She has always lived with the stigma of being less then perfect, unable to master even the simplest of magical feats. Of course, there is the irresistible pet \\"rock\\" of Jack, Mistrock, who attaches itself to Jack, never straying far from his side.<br /><br />For the most part, action is present throughout the story, though it does wane a bit at times, focusing on Leila and Jack's journey across the Tower Lands. One thing that never quite was fully understood by this reviewer however, was Jack's almost obsessive aversion to all things magical. He did survive a very traumatic experience as a young child, but as it was totally unrelated to magic, this reviewer could never quite understand why he will avoid it at all costs, but not seem to have the same aversion to other things which can cause the same feeling of being out-of-control. Other then that not quite adding up in this story, this book is an enjoyable read, keeping one's interestpiqued, even through the slower segments of the story.<br /><br />This tale is worthy of reading, bringing about an escape from reality for the reader, which is often highly sought after in today's hustle-and-bustle society. Go out and by this book, as well as the rest of the books in the series, for the reader will want to keep going until having read them all.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, April 2003.

She has refused to use them for years, ever since an incident as a young child, which made her swear to never use her ability again. Her younger sister also has strong abilities, though not as powerful as Anna's. When her sister is stalked and put into a coma after an attack by a psychic vampire, Anna is left to pick up the pieces and solve the mystery.<br /><br />Ian McGregory is an FBI agent who has been tracking the killer for many years. He has reason to believe the man who attacked Anna's sister is the same person who has attacked women in other cities over the years. His stake in this case is personal... he has ties to the villain he does not want exposed to the world, for it would reveal secrets best left alone.<br /><br />Ian and Anna need each other. He needs her to use her abilities to see what she can find out about the psychic vampire and to draw him out of hiding. She needs Ian to solve the mystery of who attacked her sister and to stop him from killing more people.<br /><br />Through the investigation, Anna and Ian become drawn to each other, unable to resist the allure of their mutual attraction. Ian starts to realize he cannot use Anna as a pawn to keep his secret safe and find the attacker. He finds himself wanting to confide in her; even at the risk his secret will push her away forever. Can they overcome the odds to solve the mystery and find love with one another?<br /><br />This book by Shauna Michaels was a winner. It keeps the reader enthralled from the very first chapter and doesn't let up until the end. There are a few unique twists, which come as a surprise when the mystery is solved and the villain's destiny revealed. There is also a touch of sci-fi as well, in Ian's secret he doesn't want revealed.<br /><br />Ian and Anna work well together, in and out of the bedroom, matching wits and each having strengths where the other is weak. The complement each other well, and their love is strong, leaving no doubt in the reader's mind that they will have their \\"Happy-ever-after.\\"<br /><br />This book was the reviewer's first one by the author, but it certainly won't be the last.

He had been a knight during medieval times, in the small country of San Rimini. He had been cursed by a witch when he refused to help a young boy in need because he thought his mission for the King far more important then a peasant child's life. His curse left him to wander the Earth, never aging until he learned the importance of sacrificing for the benefit of another.<br /><br />Princess Isabella of San Rimini has a pet project she needs help with. Her mother's dream, before her death, had been to have a museum display of San Rimini historical artifacts. Isabella intends to see her mother's dream realized and needs Nick's help. For he is the expert on San Rimini history, though none know the real reason for that... that he had lived it all. She comes to the US where he lives the life of a recluse, except for a couple close associates, to hopefully hire Nick to work on her project.<br /><br />Nick refuses at first, fearing the attention and publicity from the media. He can't let anyone discover his secret and turn him into a scientific experiment. When Isabella agrees to all of his conditions, and agrees to give him full access to all artifacts, he can't refuse. He had spent the past 800 years collecting documents and artifacts, hoping to find something... anything... that will lead him to the witch who cursed him, and a way to break it.<br /><br />What Nick never counted on was falling in love with Isabella and she with him. Now he has even more to fear - how would she react to finding out about his curse? Does he stay with her and risk her hatred bound to develop once she realizes the full impact of his curse? Or does he leave San Rimini and Isabella to protect his secret? Will his curse ever be broken so he can finally find peace?<br /><br />Ms. Burnham continues her San Rimini Royal Family miniseries with this pleasant tale. She shows her talent for spinning a sweet story, full of love and joy that many people live to experience. She expands a little more on the family in this book, and the reader gets the chance to visit with characters from past books, and some who likely will be getting their own story before too long.<br /><br />Nick and Isabella are a good couple and Nick's turmoil is believable. He may have started out as a man committed to one thing, his King, but that changes as through time he learns he must learn to care more about other things, and people, if he ever hopes to break the curse and live a normal life. In a way, Isabella is like him - dedicated to her country, family, and causes, above all else, even herself. She had forgotten how to just live, experiencing life for the sheer joy it brings. Together, they learn to live again, experiencing happiness, as they had never really known it before.<br /><br />This book has everything lovers of romance novels want. There is a fine story fully realized, plenty of charming and endearing characters, a little bit of adventure, a touch of fantasy, and of course the key elements - love and romance. This book was this reviewer's first read by Nicole Burnham, but it intrigued her enough to want to seek out the rest of the series as well.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, June 2003.

He was known to abuse her often, with words and actions. When she learns of his death she is elated, for now she can have the freedom she had thought out of her reach forever. Until a carriage accident leaves her badly injured and alone, her two traveling companions killed.<br />Royce Campbell had retreated to a small cottage to recover from the wounds of his most recent battle, wounds of both the physical and psychological kind. While out hunting one day, he happened upon a destroyed carriage, two dead men, and one gravely injured woman. He takes her to his cottage to help her recover, giving up his much desired solitude for healing.<br />When Brianna awakens, and first sees the hideously scarred visage of her rescuer, she screams in fear and promptly passes out. Upon wakening, she slowly comes to realize Royce means her no harm and allows him to continue her care. As they spend this time isolated together over many weeks, she learns he is an honorable man who truly cares for her, nothing like her late husband. She grows to love this wonderful man, and he her, and they decide to wed as soon as she is well enough to travel home to her brother, Ian, her guardian since the passing of her husband.<br />Fate has other plans for these star-crossed lovers. What Brianna doesn't discover until later, is that Royce is a legendary warrior, feared by even the strongest of men. Upon learning this, she begins to doubt the man who has shown her nothing but love, respect, and kindness. Just as she comes to accept him for whom he is, fate intervenes once again, throwing a surprising twist at them, just after they have said their marriage vows. Their love must now face the ultimate test, to determine if she can love him forever.<br />What should have been a wonderful story falls flat for this reviewer. For most of the story, the plot is very slow and not overly exciting. Over half of the book is all about Brianna's recovery, having her sleeping or lying in bed. There isn't a whole lot of action until much later. The primary storyline takes too long to develop, making this reader wonder if anything was ever going to happen. When the story finally picks up, there still doesn't seem to be much there.<br />Having read, and enjoyed, most of Ms. Fletcher's other works, one can only hope this tale is a fluke occurrence and that future books will prove more indicative of her talents. Other readers may enjoy this story though, even if this reviewer was unimpressed.<br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, April 2003. All rights reserved.overly exciting.

For as long as he can remember, Stefan has been with Roland, and he would do absolutely anything for his friend and master. He is a peaceful boy, who has no memory of how he came to be at Woodbridge in service to the King. His favorite thing to do, when not serving, is to play his beloved lute. He has a magic touch, and a magical voice as well.<br /><br />Roland longs for adventure and hopes to see something of his kingdom before taking over the crown when his father no longer can. When he overhears a discussion about shipment of furs to be sent down river and traded, he begs his father to allow him to accommodate the captain and the traders. So, off he goes, with the ever-faithful Stefan by his side, to spread his wings and see the world.<br /><br />Only a few days into the journey, the raft carrying the furs, and crew, is attacked, nearly everyone killed. The only survivors are Roland, Stefan, and a trader, Collyn, and that is only by sheer luck, for they are believed dead as well. This is where the real journey begins. The three unlikely allies must venture through the forbidden Starlit Wood, only remaining stronghold of the elven race. When they are captured, the secrets are revealed. Stefan is really Steavil Andundalae, the prince to the throne of the elves! He was believed to be killed 15 years ago, by a rogue sorcerer, determined to rule the human AND elven worlds.<br /><br />Now Roland and Stefan must take different roads, each to fulfill their own separate destinies. And one of their dreams is to try to make allies, rather then enemies, of the elven and human worlds. Along the way, they each must fight their personal demons, and they come to find they have a common enemy as well, and that there is far more binding them to each other then they previously thought. Will Steavil and Roland fulfill their duties? Will they be able to unite their worlds against the prejudice long ingrained in humans and elves alike? Who is this common enemy they fight and what are his reasons for wanting to destroy them both? And who... or what... is the mysterious Ravenwing that always seems to appear when danger is imminent? There is only one way to find out... read.<br /><br />Wow!! This book was incredible! It is full of action and adventure - a coming of age tale of two young men whose lives are permanently intertwined in ways they don't fully understand. It is also an age-old tale of good vs. evil, with a spin on it, which makes one wonder \\"What if?\\" From the very first page, one knows they are in for a treat. Ms. Sheridan grabs the reader, tugging at the heartstrings, and never letting go until they very last page is turned. There are so many intriguing plots and subplots going at once, that one has to pay close attention so as not to miss something vital to the story.<br /><br />The heroes are unique, and unexpected, each having their own personal demons to fight... Steavil with his crippled leg he is convinced will always hinder those he loves, Collyn with his guilt over past occurrences he had no control over, who is determined not to let down those who mean the most to him ever again, and Roland with his fear and often uncontrollable rages, who is terrified of letting his father down and failing in his duties as prince and future king to his land. Then there are the secondaries, all of which are fascinating in their own right and all very individual, often with hidden agendas tied into their responsibilities to others.<br /><br />Though this book is not a romance, by a long shot, there are a few undercurrents of romance to be found, which end up being key to the plot. Roland and Steavil each find love along the way in their respective quests, both in the unlikeliest of places. Full of ideals and morals, they each grow, through their love for their families, which are notalways bound by blood, but by the heart.<br /><br />Go out and buy a copy of this book today, and be sure to check out the accompanying short story, Everything to Gain, found at the publisher's website.&lt;Pbuy a copy of this book today, and be sure to check out the accompanying short story, Everything to Gain, found at the publisher's website.<P	2003-06-23

She is busy working hard to make things run smoothly and really doesn't have the time to show around a visiting news reporter, but agrees to do so, as long as it does not interfere with her responsibilities to the committee and running the town's weekly newspaper, The Herald.<br /><br />Theodore \\"Mace\\" Mason is feeling hindered in his job as a news reporter for TV channel, WMAC \\"where nice news matters,\\" in Erie, PA, and longs for the bigger and brighter opportunities only available to him in a big city. The last thing he wants is to spend a week in a hodunk town like Hiho (founded by Hiram and Hortense Hump of Erie, PA), reporting on something as insignificant to him as its centennial. Mace's boss is adamant that he covers the celebration, and the preparations leading up to it, also using Hiram as the subject of the next edition in his documentary series, \\"Chronicles.\\"<br /><br />Mace goes reluctantly, planning to use the week to evaluate his options for what direction he wants his career to take. Then he meets Zoe, complete with her \\"big\\" teased hair and horrendous makeup (the result of a makeover she grudgingly agreed to for one of the beauty shops in town). The entire time they are talking, he uses all of his willpower not to even crack a smile at the image before him, winning Zoe's respect when he doesn't poke fun at her appearance... until she overhears him insult her adopted home.<br /><br />Zoe doesn't like Mace's attitude, even though she finds herself attracted to him. She captivates him, in spite of the fact she is just a small-town woman, the antithesis to what he always thought he wanted. They are thrown together when it is brought to Zoe's attention that Hiho may not be 100 years old after all, but actually 99, which would have a huge negative impact on the local library and college, who are counting on funding to be granted from the Pawley Trust, upon the town's centennial. Zoe and Mace have to work together to find the answer, even tough they are not quite sure how each other will handle it. Attraction grows between them, but they wonder if anything can come of it because of their conflicting views.<br /><br />As always, this story is another winner for Ms. Jacobs. The Hundred Year Itch is full of everything indicative of her personal style and flair. There are loveable characters that come to life, a charming storyline, and an abundance of the humor one has come to associate with Holly Jacobs' books.<br /><br />Zoe and Mace are a perfect match for each other, their respective personalities complementary, while providing plenty of conflict as they try to understand each other's dreams. The town of Hiho is populated with colorful characters like the cloak-and-dagger prone Bertram, sisters Cora and Ida MacIntosh who are infamous for their apple pie, and disgruntled over the selection of the toothless Tom Walters as judge for the festival bake-off. In addition, how can one forget Jed, the love struck bull?<br /><br />Be forewarned though; take care in when and where choosing to read this amusing tale, or the reader may find oneself bursting with laughter at rather inopportune moments. This reviewer speaks from experience - having done just that at a business conference. Rush out and buy this book today! There is certainly no danger of disappointment in that.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

He is hanging on by a thread, in the hopes of finding his one true lifemate who will bring emotion and color back to his world. He condemned himself to a life alone, hunting the dreaded vampire, evil beings of his kind, when a huge error in judgment almost cost his Prince's lifemate her life. Until the day he heard the call of music...<br /><br />Antonietta \\"Toni\\" Scarletti is a world famous concert pianist and composer, living in Italy. She was blinded when a young child, by an accident that took her parents' lives. She feels an emptiness in her soul, that even her close relationships with her grandfather and cousins cannot fill. Her music is all she has that sometimes makes her feel whole and complete again. Then one day Byron enters her life.<br /><br />When Byron finds Toni, his world explodes with color and emotion. He knows immediately she is his lifemate and like all of the males of his kind, can do nothing but protect his other half from the moment he finds her. She is very independent however, in spite of her lack of sight, and does not exactly appreciate Byron's over-protectiveness, in spite of her great attraction to him. Some of her family also are suspicious of his attention to her, so begin questioning the strange attraction between the two of them.<br /><br />When strange accidents start happening at the palazzo, accidents that make it apparent someone wishes to kill Toni and her grandfather, Don Giovanni, Byron is all the more protective, wanting to keep her from harm. In addition, a dangerous predator is on the loose, a wild cat, killing townsfolk and trying to get members of the Scarletti family. Now Byron must make his move, binding Toni to him forever, as one of his kind, to keep her and her family safe. Who is the person trying to kill the family, and why? What is Toni's unique link to the jaguar stalking their home? Mysteries will be solved and answers revealed.<br /><br />Ms Feehan has done it again! She has written yet another brilliant addition to her Dark saga. Her loyal fans finally have one of the most breathlessly anticipated stories, that of Byron. He struck a chord with many of her fans upon being first introduced in her first book, and many have been waiting for his story. At last they have it! Byron and Toni's story will reel the reader in from the first page and never lets up its hold. Their passion is limitless, electrifying, in spite of their weaknesses. Toni has a hard time believing anyone could possibly want her for herself and not her money. After all, she is blind and believes she is ugly, so who could possibly want her? Byron needs her and loves her for herself, but Toni has to learn that for herself.<br /><br />Also of note in this story, Ms. Feehan seamlessly weaves three different worlds she has created into one, her gothic stories, her Carpathian stories, and her fantasy stories all come together in this story, making it memorable and showcasing her amazing talent. Very few authors could pull off such a feat, but she does it brilliantly. She also introduces readers to some new characters, and a new line of Carpathian blood, which will likely come into play in future books. And who can resist a chance to visit some beloved characters from past books?<br /><br />Ms. Feehan is a phenomenal writer, with lots of talent and skill for weaving worlds that will keep one entranced from the first to last page.

There is one witness to the real crime, Lily White, one of the local prostitutes, and she holds his freedom in the palm of her hand. But she is only willing to secure his freedom for a price, and when Wade refuses her offer, she leaves him there without a backward glance,  but not before winding up pregnant. Wade swears he will prove his innocence, and later breaks out of prison.<br /><br />Callie Quinn is a lone woman living on the outskirts of Purgatory, Texas. Her brother, Nathan, has gone off to California in the hopes of making his fortune in the gold mines. Her friend, Lily gave birth to a son, Matthew, and just before she died, entrusted him into Callie's care. Callie loves Matthew as her own and would do anything to protect the baby from harm. One night, as she is enjoying a brief respite in her bath from the baby's demands, she is startled to see the unkempt and frightening, in shackles no less, man standing in her cabin. Her first thought is to protect Matthew at any cost, even when the man reveals himself to be the father of that child.<br /><br />Wade's plan had been to come to his friend Nathan Quinn for help in clearing his name, and to claim his baby. His plans take a side trip when he comes across Callie in her bath. Though his ultimate goals have not changed, his method of achieving them has. Callie is unsure of whether or not Wade is innocent of his alleged crime but one thing she is sure of is that no one is going to take Matthew away from her, even his very own father!<br /><br />Wade and Callie form an unlikely alliance in the hopes of proving Wade's innocence, with one common goal, to do what is best for little Matthew. Unfortunately their views on that differ. But the more time they spend together, the more they realize Wade's salvation, and Callie's desires to protect herself and the baby, lie in each other. The only way to reach their seemingly unattainable goals is in freeing Wade of the stigma as murderer following him.<br /><br />Ms. Betts has proven her growing talent for writing passionate tales of life and love in the Old West. Her characters are skillfully rendered, taking on a life and vigor all their own. Richly detailed, this story is one that is sure to delight old fans, and bring in new ones as well.

Until the disastrous event which happened at the senior prom, changing her mind about him for good... or so she thought.<br /><br />Now they are all grown up and Jake is going through a rather public divorce. He's got a morning radio show, which his callers seem to think makes his private life public. When he insults Julie on his show, she's had enough. She had been the counselor/psychologist his wife had seen before the divorce, and Jake twisted everything around that his ex-wife had said about her, to make it material for use in his show.<br /><br />Julie agrees to an interview on his show, after he basically cons her into it, but wears a disguise so he won't know who she really is. Things get ugly and she is even more embarrassed after the show. How could she have ever thought Jake was any sort of Romeo?<br /><br />When Jake discovers who she really is, he is floored... she's \\"the one that got away\\" for him, and he has never forgotten her. When he tricks her into helping him with his dating techniques, for discussion on his show, Julie finds herself been drawn even more under his spell. Until the day comes that they both realize it is a new game they are playing, one they are playing for keeps.<br /><br />Until Jake's ex wife gets involved, deciding maybe she wants to keep Jake after all. Will Julie and Jake ever get together to act on their feelings for each other?<br /><br />This was a cute story, with quite a different spin on the Romeo and Juliet story. Things always seem stacked against Jake and Julie, always interfering with the powerful attraction they have for each other. Neither one has ever forgotten the other, nor the event which happened on prom night, changing their lives forever. Jake is determined to win her over for good this time, and has quite a time proving to her it's worth it.<br /><br />There was also a nice additional side story, one involving Julie's best friend and a business rival. All of the characters in the story are so lively; one can't help but love them all. The reader gets to know some of Julie's clients rather well also, adding another level of depth to the story. The whole thing is laugh out loud funny, providing many moments of entertainment. But there is a level of high school silliness to the plotline, which can get slightly annoying at times. All in all, however, this was a fun read, worth the time taken to indulge in this humorous tale.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, December 2002.

She is dedicated to Martha, feeling that is the least she can do in return for all the family did for her. She never tires of helping those in need, and never asks for anything in return. She hides her passionate nature under widow's weeds, only allowing it to surface in the form of her colorful and racy undergarments. Her only other devotion is to the local orphanage, Purgatory's Home for Unwanted Children. She is unable to have children of her own, so she dotes on the orphans, and will do anything for them, even if it means she must play Robin Hood, stealing goods from the rich folk in the town and donating the money anonymously to the orphanage.<br /><br />Clayton Walker is a Texas Ranger who comes to Purgatory at the request of his Aunt Martha, to capture the burglar plaguing the town. He arrives, much to his dismay, sentenced to stay there until the crook is behind bars. What he doesn't expect is that no one in town, including the sheriff, who makes no secret of the fact he has no need or desire for Walker's assistance, seem especially concerned over the local thefts. Neither was he prepared for the beautiful young widow of his cousin, a beauty with flame-colored hair and tantalizing curves.<br /><br />Regan guards her independence vehemently, having no wish to turn it over to anyone, no matter how appealing they might be. She is content to go about her life as she had been. Until one night, when out on one of her \\"missions,\\" she overhears a murder! She can't reveal what she knows, certain it would reveal her secret life, sending her straight to the hangman's noose.<br /><br />All the while, Regan and Walker grow closer to each other, unable to resist the temptation standing right in front of them. She is afraid to get too close though, unwilling to give up the freedom provided by her status as widow, and terrified of what he would do if he knew her secret. Now she has to make a choice, does she tell all to Walker, and get his help in resolving the mystery of who committed murder, risking her own neck when he realizes she is the very crook he has been sent to apprehend?<br /><br />This debut story in Ms. Betts' Welcome to Purgatory series is a delight! She knows her historical facts, as is evident here. She showcases her brilliant use of humor and passion in this story, supplemented with a healthy dose of mystery. One is immediately drawn into the story, and is held enthralled right through to the very last page.<br /><br />Each and every character is a pleasure, so wonderfully depicted. Regan shows a spunk all her own, and a passionate nature she keeps hidden under a demure facade. Walker is an honorable man, torn between his duty and his desire. When these two get together, fireworks are bound to erupt! The secondary characters were special as well, with Martha adding lightness to the tale, and the orphans (especially Hannah and David) giving even more depth to the storyline. Readers will be happy to know they get to visit again with some of the beloved characters here, in other books in the series.<br /><br />Had this reviewer not already been a fan of Ms. Betts, this book would have changed that.

She spent most of her childhood there. Now she is all grown up and is the teacher at the school in town. She is happy with her life, though sometimes lonely, and is content to go on living as she had. Her only regret was David... The only boy she had ever loved - the boy who had always been there for her when she needed him most as she was growing up.<br /><br />Then one day David, who now goes by Spirit Walker, shows up on her doorstep! David's half-sister, whom he discovered upon returning to his mother's Comanche village, was in a horrible relationship with a harsh man. She was beaten, abused, taunted and insulted for her Indian heritage, and her son by this man was in no better situation. He was ridiculed for being a half-breed, which raises David's ire. He can't stand to see his nephew suffer for his heritage, as David did growing up. He tries to rescue his family from this situation, in hopes of saving his sister and her unborn child. He was seriously injured and in dire need of Hannah's help.<br /><br />Hannah hadn't seen him in years, ever since he left town and his adoptive parents to live in his mother's Indian village. She has never forgotten all he did for her as children, and will do anything to help him now when he needs her. David too, has never forgotten the little girl with the sad eyes from the orphanage. So, knowing it could put her job at risk, Hannah will stop at nothing to help David and his family, even if it means following him into Hell, literally---a neighboring town full of criminals and ruffians.<br /><br />When trouble comes knocking on the door of their hideaway, Hannah and David will do whatever it takes to protect his family, even at the risk of themselves. What neither counted on was that the love they had for one another had not gone away, but grew and matured into something deeper and more powerful. David believes he can never have Hannah, for he was nothing but a no-good half-breed, hated by all, or so he thinks. Can Hannah prove to him he is deserving of so much more, and convince him his heritage means nothing to those around them? Will they overcome their differences to reach the happiness they can only find in each other?<br /><br />Ms. Betts has once again proven her talent for writing historical romance full of passion and adventure. This was her first foray into the world of Native American romance and she has done a remarkable job! One can see the attention to detail and the research put into this book. She paints a brilliant picture of the life of the times, so much so, one feels to be there.<br /><br />Hannah and David first captured the attention of this reviewer when they made their first appearance in Walker's Widow, leaving behind a desire to hear more of their story, and the love evident even when they were children. Hannah grew from the frightened young girl, suffering through the loss of her parents, into a stunning woman, strong and proud, who has never lost her zest for life. David was as surly young man when first introduced, but has grown into a powerful warrior of a man, though he still holds onto some of that surliness, until Hannah shows him the light. There two were meant for each other from the beginning, causing the reader to cheer them on to a happy-ever-after.<br /><br />Ms. Betts' is a force to be reckoned with in the historical romance genre, with her talent becoming more evident in each successive book.

When her friend was brutally murdered by a psychotic, and otherworldly, killer, Kirby was left all alone and scared, for the same killer was after her. She has no idea who is after her or why, but she does know her life is in serious danger. She goes on the run, with only a few meager possessions, and her magical powers as her defense. That is not enough and just as she fears her life is about to be snuffed out, her rescuer arrives.<br /><br />Doyle Fitzgerald is in Melbourne, Australia, per the orders of the Damask Circle, a special and elite ring of magical beings who are sent to handle special cases all over the world where magic is concerned. His latest mission is to hunt down and destroy the very murderer who is after Kirby. He comes to her rescue, just as she is about to be killed, killing the monster that was after her, but having no idea how to track down the being that is using the creatures.<br /><br />Kirby has no idea why someone is after her, but Doyle is, and she is shocked to hear the story. She has no memory of her childhood, or of the incident that seemed to spark this string of serial murders. What she doesn't know, is Kirby is one of a circle of women... witches... who have the power to control the elements. Kirby is the last remaining witch of this circle, the only person standing in the way of her ultimate enemy having all the powers at her disposal, and causing awesome destruction in her wake.<br /><br />Doyle finds himself completely attracted to Kirby, as she is to him, and he will do anything to protect her. However, she isn't the only one with secrets and gifts, for Doyle has some special powers of his own. Powers he is hesitant to share with her just now. Her nerves are at the breaking point already and he fears she couldn't handle his secret on top of everything else. As much as she is drawn to him, she fears getting too close, for she knows the awesome strength of her abilities and she doesn't want him to be threatened by what she has little control over. Will they overcome their secrets? Will they defeat the person stalking Kirby? Or will the world end in the ultimate battle of good versus evil?<br /><br />What a fabulous read! This story has all the elements of good paranormal romantic fiction. There is plenty of driving action and suspense to keep one's attention right up to the very end. There is love and romance, magic, good and evil. There is also any number of paranormal beings found between the covers. It is populated with vampires, witches, demons, and shapeshifters galore; it will make the readers wonder what secrets their friends and loved ones are carrying.<br /><br />Ms. Arthur shows in this book why she is rising through the ranks of this sub-genre quite rapidly.

His goal is to become a partner at the law firm where he has worked since finishing law school. He has no desire except to make it to the top in his firm and become well known for his skill in the courtroom. The only problem is... he works for a firm where family is the most important priority. When he is told he needs to find \\"balance\\" in his life... something other then work, like a wife, to keep him grounded before he will be considered for a partnership, he is in a dilemma. He has no desire to marry, so how can he prove he deserves the promotion?<br /><br />Sarah Jane Madison is trying to make her new interior design business a success. Unfortunately money is very tight, even more so since one of her clients stiffed her on the bill. Sarah turns to Donovan, her neighbor, in hopes he can assist her in a lawsuit against her client. The only problem is, she has no money to pay the retainer fees. Donovan's prayers are answered! He decides to ask Sarah to pose as his fianc'e for an anniversary party for one of the senior partners, Leland Wagner at the law firm, in exchange for his handling her lawsuit against her client. Sarah is hesitant at first, but then decides it can't hurt much to help him.<br /><br />It is supposed to be a limited engagement, beginning in time for the party, and ending as soon as it is over. Before Sarah knows it though, she is caught in the middle of wedding plans, for a wedding she won't be having! Leland's wife and daughters are so excited that someone finally melted The Iceman's heart, they can't wait to see the wedding take place. Sarah plays along, still knowing the engagement is a ruse, but feels guilty about lying to such wonderful people.<br /><br />Suddenly, Donovan decides he wants more then an engagement, he want a marriage of convenience, to cement his position with the firm. He asks Sarah to marry him, insisting it is only temporary and he will spell everything out in a prenuptial agreement, so no one loses out on the deal. She grudgingly agrees, thinking she can keep up the charade. However, she finds herself drawn more and more to Donovan, until she realizes she loves him, The Iceman, a man known for his lack of emotion! Now comes the greatest dilemma of all, how to show Donovan a wedding farce may not be such a good idea after all. Will she play along, knowing her heart will be broken? Or will she show Donovan there is more to life then his career?<br /><br />Ms. Jacobs has done it again! She has penned a delightful tale, full of her trademark humor and pure, sweet emotion. She has taken what could be a tired storyline - a marriage of convenience - and worked her own brand of magic on it, making it different and new.

From Amelia and Mac, totally in denial of their own love story going on, to Leland Wagner and his ebullient family, everyone is a joy.

While driving through Mexico, he is pulled over for what seems to be a routine traffic stop. However, it is anything but routine. He is shot in the head and left for dead on the side of the road. Six months later, Jonathon, who now goes by John, has had a rather miraculous recovery, but he has no memory of most of the events leading up to his rather uncharacteristic vacation. Just as John is leaving the hospital to go home, there is some rather shocking news uncovered. One of his partners was found dead, having disappeared right around the same time John left for Mexico, and John is the prime suspect!<br /><br />Katie Cavanaugh is an undercover FBI agent, posing as John's physical therapist. She is on a mission to prove John's guilt in the murder of Derek Miller, one of his partners. She has her own reasons for wanting to solve this murder and doesn't want to let anything get in the way. From the moment she meets John though, she realizes this will be no ordinary case for her. There is an immediate attraction between the two of them, and though both know they should resist it, do they really want to?<br /><br />John is a totally different man as a result of his attempted murder, parts of his memory gone forever and lacking the ability to perform even the simplest of tasks easily. While he struggles to overcome his injury, he must also face the fact that his partners in his business don't seem to want him around anymore. His only constant is Katie, but if he knew her secret, he'd want nothing to do with her.<br /><br />Katie has her work cut out for her, she has to catch a killer and time is running out.

Through it all, Katie and John draw closer to each other, and she realizes he couldn't possibly be the murderer. When it appears his life is in serious danger yet again, Katie has to make a choice. Should she reveal her own secrets and risk losing forever the man she is fast discovering she cannot live without? Or does she keep her identity a mystery, and stick around long enough to protect John at the risk of her own life?

When her good intentions backfire while helping the young daughter of the Idaho governor, Shelly goes on the run. Gov.

She is known by everyone for her optimistic attitude, and her Pollyanna view of the world. She was doing a segment for her \\"About Town\\" feature for the TV station, posing as a pregnant woman to see how people would respond. While interviewing a young man who had given up his seat for her on a shuttle bus, she starts to feel pains in her abdomen. She is at first convinced it's nothing until they get so severe, she really feels like she is pregnant.    Riley Calhoon is also a news reporter, for a local paper, who is known for his \\"Get Real\\" column, where he gives the city a dose of real life, to make people wake up and realize what was going on in the world. He had borrowed a friend's cab for the day and unexpectedly comes across Paige, in disguise, who was looking and sounding ready to give birth immediately. He rushes her to the hospital, and tries to distract her with idle chatter while they are en route. He is surprised by himself and the effort he was making to keep her calm. Everyone knows him for being opinionated and negative. But something about this woman struck him in a way he couldn't imagine.    A few days later, Paige tracks him down to thank him for helping her. If not for him, her appendix would have ruptured and she could have died. She calls him her hero and wants to interview him for her news broadcast. Riley refuses; afraid to let anyone see the crack in his surly attitude she causes, making her swear to not reveal his role in her rescue without his express agreement and gives her a hard time. Paige is bound and determined to get her interview one way or another, and is convinced she can bring him around.    She starts dogging his footsteps everywhere he goes and Riley gets more irritated the more she \\"runs into\\" him. In spite of that, he finds himself actually having a smidge of feelings for her, loving her bright view of the world through her rose-colored glasses. The two couldn't be more opposite, but for some unexplainable reason, he intrigues her as well. Even with memories of their disastrous first meeting several months ago, a blind date set up by her Aunt Annabelle, and the fact they couldn't stand each other then, there is something drawing them to each other, which neither can define nor explain. They find themselves in a relationship of sorts, mutually beneficial to the both of them....     Until Riley's secret about his rescue of Paige gets out. He accuses her of lying and manipulating him to get her story, and is furious with her. She swears she never told anyone about it and is so hurt by his accusations, that she wants nothing to do with him. Now Riley realizes the truth, he really does love her, and was mistaken about her. But how to get her to forgive him? Riley enlists the help of WMAC, and the entire city, to prove his love for Paige. He comes up with a scheme even Paige couldn't resist. Or could she?     Ms. Jacobs has done it again! Her story is a pleasure, full of characteristic humor and charm. Paige's \\"glass half full\\" outlook on life and Riley's \\"glass half empty\\" attitude are at odds from the beginning, even apparent in the flashback memories they both have of their first meeting, the blind date from hell. But that only adds to the hilarity of their relationship when they meet again. What comes next is a comedy of errors as Paige tries to bring him around to her way of thinking.     Aunt Annabelle adds another touch of mirth to the story, with her persistent belief the two are meant for each other. Her habit of cheating at cards also is amusing, which no one can catch her at, but all are convinced she does, adding some lively moments to her life in a retirement home. Even the animal characters in the story, Riley's dog, Pugsley, he is roped into adopting and Paige's attack cat, Cuddles brighten the story, bringing out even more humor, and a soft side to Riley.Another bright spot in this lively tale, is the cameo appearance of a few beloved secondary characters from the book Do You Hear What I Hear?    One can never go wrong with a story by Ms. Jacobs, and that is proven once again here, in Not Precisely Pregnant. Her books are guaranteed to provide plenty of entertainment, and more laughs then should be legal. Her love of life, and her ability to find the fun in anything, comes out on every page. This is one reader who is a die-hard fan, and will remain so for as long as the books keep coming. If this book is any indication, and it is, Ms. Jacobs will be around for a long time, adding \\"joie de vive\\" to every day.	2003-01-03

A delegate from the King arrives, Lord Stephan, to take her to the King so he can question her himself. Stephan hates anything related to witchcraft and sorcery, so he is not too keen on the mission, only doing it because his King demands it. Jinny is given a brief reprieve from her sentence, as the two of them set forth across the mountains.<br /><br />As they travel across the treacherous mountains, the must learn to work together and trust one another if they are to survive. Their journey is fraught with peril, and it will take all Stephan's skill to keep them going, for Jinny is blocked from using her magic. Until Stephan is horribly injured while protecting Jinny, in a life or death struggle with some starving wolves.

But his loyalty to his King comes first and that means delivering Jinny to him. Can they overcome the problems and prejudice standing in their way to happiness? And just what ARE those mysterious shrines they pass in the mountains on their way to the King?<br /><br />This was quite an absorbing read. The story of Jinny and Stephan is a delightful one, captivating the reader from the get-go. Jinny is just a young woman who happens to be a witch, and is trying to do what is right. Stephan is a loyal and dedicated man, sworn to do his duty at any costs. The mutual attraction between the two of them causes plenty of believable conflict to keep the reader going. This story is about overcoming one's deeply ingrained beliefs, to find what one desires above all.<br /><br />The detail in this story paints a very clear picture, so the reader feels transported to another time and place, where magic is a matter of course. How beautifully described are the mountains, and the magic emanating from them and Jinny, so much so, that one can really picture it in the mind's eye.<br /><br />Jinny and Stephan are both strong characters, well developed and fully dimensional. They have to be, for through the majority of the story, they are the only two people. So they have to be thought out enough to be able to carry the story on their more than capable shoulders.<br /><br />This reviewer loved this tale and eagerly anticipates many future stories form the talented Ms. McCullough.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />In Dreams by Nora Roberts<br />Kayleen Brennan was on vacation in Ireland, exploring the countryside and hoping to find some goods for her family's antique store in the States. When out exploring, she gets caught in a bad storm. The enigmatic Flynn rescues her, and then her adventures really begin. He is cursed to spend eternity living only through his dreams, with one week every 100 years to truly live. He intends to make this week one to remember with Kayleen, hoping to convince her to be with him forever. She is drawn to him, but when she finds out his secret, will she be able to accept him for who, or what, he is?<br /><br />This was another good story from a master, but has a tendency to get bogged down in details. Granted, the heroine is an antiques expert, but is it really necessary to go into so much detail about Flynn's furniture? Queen Anne this, Louis XV that, it is overdone and detracts from the story. Kayleen and Flynn make an interesting pair however, complementing each other in many ways. The story surrounding Flynn is intriguing, as to why he is condemned to the \\"life\\" he has. If one can get past the over-the-top detail in many places, this is a delightful story.<br /><br />The Sorcerer's Daughter by Jill Gregory<br />Willow of Brinhaven's father, a powerful dream sorcerer, is imprisoned for angering the great sorceress Lisha. He is doomed to remain there for 100 years, unless Willow brings Lisha the Necklace of Nyssa, which is protected by the Trolls. He father vows to send out a dream to a protector for Willow on her quest, leading her through the Perilous Forest and Troll's Lair. But in error, the wrong person, Blaine of Kendrick, receives the dream. Blaine is known for causing trouble and his exploits with women, and he is the last person she should count on. But upon meeting, they are drawn to each other and eventually agree to go on the quest together. But the more they are together, the more Blaine wishes for a different quest, one to win the fair Willow's heart forever.<br /><br />This was quite a fantasy tale, with trolls, sorcerers, and magic galore. It has a cute storyline, with details of Willow's quest, and the matching of wits between Blaine and Willow. Blaine is the typical \\"bad boy\\" of those days, and Willow is a young woman trying to overcome her position in life. The sparks between the two of them will light up the darkest of nights. There is also an interesting side story; the real reason Lisha imprisoned Willow's father.<br /><br />The Enchantment by Ruth Ryan Langan<br />Annie Tyler is trying to make a real estate business for herself in Maine. Things are going fairly well, but she gets her break when Cordelia Sykes Carrington, one of the wealthiest women in the state, solicits Annie to sell her summer home. When Annie arrives, expecting to have the place to herself, she is surprised to find Ben Carrington, one of Cordelia's sons, show up as well. When they become trapped there together by a sudden storm, strange things begin to happen, with a lack of electricity keeping them cut off from the outside world. But even stranger is the fact that they are falling for each other. When the storm is over and things are back to normal, will they find their attraction is real, or just a dream?<br /><br />This was an okay story, but probably the least favorite of this reviewer's in the collection. Too many things are far-fetched and unrealistic. Example, Isn't it rather strange that ALL the power in the house, all the phones, and their cell phones don't work, but the refrigerator works just fine? The point is made several times throughout how there was a power failure, but neither character thinks it odd that the refrigerator works when the stove doesn't. Some of these smaller details just confuse the story, distracting one from the love story between Ben and Annie.<br /><br />The Bridge of Sighs by Marianne Willman<br />Claire is an American art appraiser, trying to overcome her recent divorce from her adventurous ex-husband, Val. She gets the chance of a lifetime when Count Ludovici of Venice, summons her from one of the oldest and richest families in the city, to inventory and appraise his extensive art collection. She can't resist the chance to return to Venice, where she was born, but left as a young child. Her ex-husband is also there, to photograph the artwork, much to Claire's dismay. Or is it? She still loves him but is convinced things will never work. When she starts having haunting dreams of a young girl, Bianca... a dream which fast becomes a nightmare, upon learning Bianca disappeared many years ago, believed to be murdered. Will Claire and Val learn to be together again, or are they truly meant to be apart? Who is the mysterious Bianca, and what happened that fateful night she disappeared?<br /><br />This was probably the favorite story in the collection. Especially since this reviewer was reading it during her very own dream vacation in Venice! It was fun to be reading about the very sights being visited. The story in itself is well written, too. Claire is a bit lost; trying to find her place in her life after everything she thought she wanted falls apart. The addition of the sad story of Bianca, enhances the feel of the story, and makes Claire realize she needs to go after her own dreams if she ever wants to be truly happy.<br /><br />All in all, this is a memorable collection.

She had just been hired as the Chief of Police in St. Martine, her hometown. Her years away with the military made her long for home, and realize that her family is what is most important to her life.<br /><br />Nick Brannigan is an FBI agent in New York City. He was raised on the streets, heading for trouble, until his foster mother found and adopted him. He has spent every day since trying to prove to her that he is worth everything she put into raising him. His greatest ambition is to become the first black director of the FBI.<br /><br />Within a week of taking on the position of police chief, Hardie has her first, and likely most difficult case, a murder. And not just any murder, but a murder involving the mob. Her entire town, excepting a couple people, is convinced she can't handle the job as police chief, let alone, solve a murder. Not only is she fighting time to solve this case, she is fighting against the inept deputies on her force, and the negative reactions of her town to her being back.<br /><br />Enter Nick. He has been working this mob case for a very long time and has his whole career wrapped up in this dead man. He's non too keen on having to work with the local hick police chief to solve the murder, watching his dreams fall away if it can't be resolved. Until he sees her..... Hardie isn't too happy about the FBI invading her little town either, especially when he comes in spouting off about how important his career is etc.<br /><br />But in spite of their reluctance to be thrown together to solve a murder, they can't help but be attracted to each other. This mystery will turn their whole worlds upside down before it is through. And maybe in the midst of all this mayhem they will find the things that are truly important, home, family, love, and each other...<br /><br />This was a very well done story. Nick and Hardie are perfect for each other, even though in the beginning it seems they'll never work out. Their conflict between them was just right, caused by their different ambitions clashing over solving the mystery at hand. Hardie is strong, yet vulnerable at the same time. She is so determined to overcome her family history, which she felt the repercussions from her whole life, that she puts herself on the offensive immediately, to keep those who would from hurting her. Nick is consumed by his ambition to prove himself worthy, and that he is no longer that boy from the streets who would be a hoodlum, had someone not taken the time to help him get past that life and into a better one.<br /><br />The murder mystery is the focus of the entire story, with Nick and Hardie revolving around it. And it was so skillfully written, that this reviewer had no idea who the killer was, right up until the end. And normally this reviewer hates when the body counts in a mystery keep rising to continue the plot. But the additional murders in this story really did add to it, causing even more twists and turns in the plot, to keep the reader guessing.<br /><br />All of the secondary characters are a delight, adding even more to an already excellent book. None are ever thrown in for the heck of it, like can sometimes be found in books. Each and every one enhances the story line, making it more well- rounded and multi-dimensional of a tale.<br /><br />The writing duo who are JM Jeffries show excellent talent for writing a good story, with plenty of passion between the main characters, to ensure that the romance of the story is not overshadowed by the adventure.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />Jake Manning has a plan, a BABY PLAN that is! He has everything a man could possibly desire, except for one thing... a baby. He is so busy though, that he has no desire for a wife to go along with the baby, in addition to the fact that he has already had experience in the husband department and didn't have much luck there. Having raised his younger siblings pretty much on his own, he is feeling a bit of \\"Empty Nest\\" syndrome, now that they are grown up and starting to have families of their own.  So he starts to hanker after having his own child, without the stresses that marrying a woman would add to his life. He knows he can raise a child by himself. Now, he just needs to find the woman to go along with his plan.<br /><br />Harley Emerson is a young woman who has had nothing but a string of bad luck in her life. She is highly intelligent, but has no formal higher education. She has no family, having spent most of her young life being shuffled from foster home to foster home. She is a brilliant mechanic, but having been arrested and convicted for a crime she didn't commit, she finds it rather difficult to get and keep a good job. She's flat broke and has no one to turn to, her only friend being her former parole officer, a man who took her under his wing and tried to help her overcome her past.<br /><br />When Jake meets Harley at the garage where his car is being fixed, he is quite intrigued by the young woman. When she loses her job due to a misunderstanding between Jake and her employer, he feels responsible. As he gets to know her while trying to help her out, he decides she is the perfect woman for his plan to have a child. Upon approaching Harley with his idea, going so far as to send a \\"Daddy R'sum',\\" she is at first insulted and infuriated. She finally comes around though, but not without making a few conditions of her own - she will only agree to a traditional conception and a marriage of convenience until the baby is born. No child of hers will be born outside the boundaries of marriage, even if she won't be keeping it herself.<br /><br />All goes according to plan; until a monkey wrench is thrown in to the works... they find love. Jake has been hurt and betrayed by every woman who has been in his life, the only exception being his younger sister, so he finds it hard to trust Harley. And she is convinced a fine upstanding citizen of Erie, PA, like Jake, could never love an out-of-work mechanic with a record. Now comes the biggest challenge of all, how to overcome the obstacles to find the happiness both so desperately desire.<br /><br />What a wonderful debut novel! Ms. Gable packs an emotional wallop with this story. This is one book that is totally and completely character driven, but circumstances between Harley and Jake are cause for some conflict in the story, helping to flesh it out and make it all the more compelling to read.<br /><br />Harley and Jake are strong characters, with strong personalities, so it is no surprise that this story tugs at the heartstrings. Harley has had a tough life, molding her into the woman she is. There are times when she is reliving past experiences that the reader cannot help but feel the full intensity of her pain. She is a complex blend of woman and child, and that is evident throughout.<br /><br />Jake's feelings for his brother and sister are overwhelming to him at times, causing much inner turmoil when it is apparent that his feelings for Harley and his family are at odds with what everyone expects of him. Also, his pain over those he feels deserted him when he needed them color his way of thinking and his attitude in general, until he learns to let go of the hurt finally.<br /><br />The reader knows from the start that Jake and Harley are meant for each other, and can't wait for them to figure that out themselves. They need each other, and the journey to that realization makes for a powerful read. If this story is any indication, Ms. Gable will be a force to contend with in the genre. She knows how to tell her story with plenty of emotion to enthrall the reader, while balancing it out with a strong plot line and even stronger characters. This reviewer will be eagerly awaiting her next book, THE MOMMY PLAN, due out in the summer of 2003.he knows how to tell her story with plenty of emotion to enthrall the reader, while balancing it out with a strong plot line and even stronger characters.

She was a spitfire of a girl, always getting into trouble, and Noah was always coming to her rescue. There was a connection between them, one that no one could explain, least of all themselves. When he left Pilot Island, NC ten years ago, young Elle's heart had been broken, and her love for Noah died with it.<br /><br />Noah was always being hounded bythe young girl Elle had been, so much so, it came to annoy him after a while, but he tolerated it nonetheless. When Elle had the misfortune of finding out about a dark Garrett family secret, she tried to hide it from him. Unfortunately, she was unsuccessful, and when Noah found out the truth, he fled the Island, swearing never to return to his home and family, and he flung Elle's feeling aside as he made his escape.<br /><br />But now Noah is back, ten years later, a hard, cold man, dedicated to his life as a scientist, and determined to avoid Elle. When he sees her for the first time, he is taken aback. The young tomboy had grown into a beautiful young woman, whose heart has grown numb to the love she once held for him. Or so she tries to tell herself... The young love she held for Noah has now changed, becoming the love of a woman for the man she will dedicate her life to. She is determined to deny it though, afraid of having her heart broken once again. Noah is startled to find he also has feelings for Elle, resolute in his conviction to ignore it, never forgetting her role in his discovery of his family skeleton. He finds he can't though and begins to realize maybe this love between them can grow into something even more special then it was before.<br /><br />This was a delightful read. Elle and Noah are so insistent that any sort of feelings between them cannot be. How is it that everyone else in town can see the attraction but them? The emotion rolling from them in waves is palpable, all mixed up with the hurt of many years before. Ms. Sumner depicts the confusion between them beautifully. Noah's relationship with his brothers is well drawn as well, and the grief all three of them felt over the revelation of a decade ago and the enduring impact it had on their lives. The agony each feels over their part of what drove Noah away is blended with the bond they have as brothers, which goes beyond blood. All of this is rendered in such a way that the reader can't help but feel their pain.<br /><br />The descriptions of Pilot Island and the life there of the townspeople are rich in detail and historical fact. In spite of the writing skill apparent throughout the book, some parts tend to drag on, being a bit too mired in detail, resulting in a slower paced story.

The only one missing was the eldest, Princess Thalassa. All were set away from their home 25 years ago, to protect them from the danger found in the wars occurring there. Thalassa has bitter memories of her home, of having seen her mother brutally murdered. She has sworn to never return until the day her father came to tell her it was safe.<br /><br />Loucan is the new king of Pacifica, whose only desire is to bring peace to the island after so many years of war. He has hopes of marrying one of the daughters of the late King Okeana, and the only one remaining is Thalassa. He has reached a dead end in his search until a few memories spark new ideas in him to find her. When he finds her...romping in the ocean with the dolphins, he knows she is what he needs to bring about peace to their homeland.<br /><br />Now comes the hard part... how can he, the son of her father's enemy and rival, convince her to return with him, especially in light of the news he carries - her father is long dead and he is now King. Lass hates him for the roles played by his family in her exile from her beloved home and she refuses to return, especially upon news that the political unrest is not yet behind them. At the same time she fears him and what he represents, she is inexplicably drawn to this man, even while not knowing if he can be trusted. Loucan desires a marriage of convenience, but upon getting to know Lass, he finds he desires her as well.<br /><br />He needs her, and she needs him, but time is limited. There is still a faction who is out to rule Pacifica, and destroy the peace Loucan is fighting for. They are after the key, part of which Lass carries, which will unlock all of Okeana's secrets to make their underwater world survive. Will Loucan win her over in time to protect her and their home? Only time will tell, and that can be found within this book.<br /><br />Ms. Darcy has penned a wonderful conclusion to the Tale of the Sea miniseries. Thalassa is probably the most complex of the siblings, with the most emotional baggage over what happened to her homeland. She is beautiful and complex, well drawn, as is the mysterious and dark Loucan. One will be drawn in to their story, eager for the ending to come.<br /><br />There were a few disappointments though. A couple of the underlying plots in the series are never fully developed or realized. Joran's story, the leader of the rebellious faction of Pacifica, who was a big reason for the wars of the island is never fully realized. It played a part in the first book, and really was not fully completed in the series. It was wrapped up in this book, but in a slightly dissatisfying way. Also, they keys to Okeana's secrets each sibling was entrusted with were a huge part in how they were found. But it is never fully explained what they unlock. It is known in general, but this reviewer would have liked to see a bigger conclusion tot hat storyline. Why were they so important that they had to be sent away with the children? It would have been nice to have even a small scene, where the door is unlocked, and the readers can see exactly what they protected. This is not necessarily the fault of Ms. Darcy however. These storylines should have been more pronounced throughout the entire series, with a passable conclusion in this, the final book.<br /><br />All in all, it was a good story though, and one definitely memorable for some time to come.to the Tale of the Sea miniseries.

She had been neglected by her family and deserted to remain at the school indefinitely but she handles it by becoming the protector of all of the younger children.  In spite of the reluctance of her relatives to accept her, Miranda has dreams of breaking out someday and making a name for herself as an actress, like her mother was. So she is more than a little surprised when suddenly her new guardian arrives to claim her, putting a glorious society life in the ton, within her reach.<br />Damien arrives at Yardley School with his news for Miranda and is stunned to see she is not a small child, but a beautiful young woman. He is even more surprised to find himself attracted to her. Miranda is taken aback when she meets her new guardian and hears the news about her uncle. Damien takes her home to Hawkscliffe Hall to live within the protection of his family until he can find her a suitable husband. She has only one man on her mind however, and that is Damien himself.<br />Miranda is warmly accepted by the entire Knight family and finds herself adjusting to this new life quite readily. Unfortunately, all is not well as a string of suspicious accidents occurs, making it apparent someone is after her, quite possibly the same person who murdered her uncle. Now Damien must track down the villain, all the while trying to fight his personal demons...and his ever-growing attraction for Miranda, before he can truly be happy and at peace.<br />Ms. Foley once again has proven herself to be a shining star of the genre. Her characters are vivid and true to life, with strong emotions, one cannot help but feel with them. The attraction between Damien and Miranda is special; at the same time they believe it is forbidden, and very real. Damien's battle with his mind, caused by his time at war, is torturous and the reader is enveloped in his pain. When he finally lets himself be healed by Miranda's love, one will be drawn into their passions.<br />This book is not at all light though, as some very serious issues, including child molestation and posttraumatic stress disorder are represented. Ms. Foley handles these with skill and delicate ease, never seeming overdone or too graphic for the faint-hearted. There is also plenty of action, which keeps things moving quickly and smoothly, finally leading up to a fulfilling climax to the tale.<br />Each successive book is wonderfully written, better than the one before, truly a delight. This reviewer looks forward to the next exciting book in the Knight saga, which is expected to be forthcoming soon.s personal demons...and his ever-growing attraction for Miranda, before he can truly be happy and at peace.<br />Ms. Foley once again has proven herself to be a shining star of the genre.

Devlin Montgomery is the owner, reluctant to sell his beloved dog. When Dev's overseer, Mr. MacGill, takes off with the dog, Toni and Dev must track him down. Along the way they find a lot more than and old man and a dog.... They find a love that just possibly may last a lifetime.<br />This was a cute story full of laughs and more than a little sexual tension between the primary characters. Ms. Brockway has drawn a fun tale, just the right length for a relaxing summer evening (or a cold winter night!) The end of the story was a bit different and fits the story's theme perfectly.<br />Sinfully Scottish by Patti Berg<br />Emily Sinclair is a national bestseller of cookbooks full of her own decadent desserts, set against stunning backdrops and passionate tales. Colin Dunbar is a reclusive Scot, famous for his family's unique recipes for whiskey. Emily and Colin make an intriguing wager, allowing her to photograph his castle for her next book and search for a secret, forcing them into living arrangements which generate far more heat than his strongest blend of whiskey.<br />This was quite a steamy story, the passion between the characters exploding off the pages. The heat radiating from this one is enough to burn the reader's fingers while turning the pages. A unique premise here, Ms. Berg has penned a delightful story.<br />The Maddening Highlander by Debra Dier<br />Ann Fitzpatrick is an archeology professor come to Scotland on a quest for treasure and a legend. Iain Matheson is something of a playboy, known as much for his adventures with the ladies as his advances in his film production company. The two team up to solve the mystery of some hidden family treasures. But they uncover a lot more than that... they find a hidden passion as well.<br />This was a classic theme, revolving around a common legend of the Highlands, but it still works.

She heads to Scotland for the birthday party of an old family friend. Here she meets Iain MacDonald who is restoring an old castle for her friends. The sparks are immediate and electric between them, igniting a passionate blaze. But will they overcome the hurdles to their once in a lifetime love?<br />This was probably the favorite story in this collection for this reviewer. Plenty of tension from the moment Iain and Maddie meet. There was even a good dose of intrigue, with a subplot involving the castle renovations.<br />All in all, a very fun book to read.

She knows she must help him, and does so while hiding him from her family. As she is helping him recover, Kaylee finds herself becoming bound to him, tighter and tighter.<br />Blue Hawk awakens to find himself in a white man's lodge, with a beautiful vision before him. He is an injured outsider to this world and longs to return to his village and people. All the while though, he is drawn to Kaylee and does not want to leave her. However, his people need him, and he longs for revenge against the white man who broke his word, stealing supplies meant for the Lakota, and shooting Blue hawk, leaving him for dead.<br />Kaylee promises to help Blue Hawk return home, getting a lot more than she bargained for in the process. Now Kaylee is the outsider among the Lakota, and must learn to live as they do. As she adapts to her new life, the passion between her and Blue Hawk grows...their love becoming stronger every day. Kaylee discovers she loves the Indian way of life, but misses her family all the same, hoping they are well.<br />However, the Lakota are on the run and Kaylee with them. Custer is tracking them down, to force all Indians on to reservations and free up their land for settlers to develop. The Indians decide to take a stand and defend their sacred land. Will they be successful? Will Kaylee and Blue Hawk overcome the odds to remain together?<br />Ms. Baker has once again proven why she is one of the reigning queens of Native American romance.

The interaction between them and the hero and heroine is well done and adds to the story. Their growth as people is as evident as Kaylee and Blue Hawk's, but never overshadows them.<br />The research that went into this story is unmistakable. One will love all of the historical facts thrown in. It was wonderful to read such detailed scenes, even the violent Battle of Little Big Horn, which is a vital turning point to the story. There is even a little bit of mystery thrown in, though this reviewer had it solved as soon as it was mentioned.<br />This is a touching story, full of emotion.

He was angry and bitter, feeling he devoted his entire life to helping the Kirallen clan, only to be cast aside when the prodigal son, Jemmy, returned. Alistair has but one purpose, to avenge the death of his brother, Ian, who had been ambushed and murdered in cold blood, by the dreaded enemy, the Darnleys. After roaming aimlessly for a while, only to strike out in his quest, he finds himself back on Kirallen land, living with an old priest, Fergus, in a cave on the outskirts. Fergus sends him off for a cleansing ritual, and hopefully a vision of guidance. Neither ever expected that guidance to come in the form of a beautiful wood sprite, named Deirdre, who comes to Alistair in a dream.<br /><br />Deirdre is a young woman, very real indeed, who is trapped in a not only loveless, but also brutal marriage as well. All she cares about is protecting her young daughter, Maeve, from the wrath of her father, Brodie Maxwell. She hopes to someday escape the prison she finds herself in, taking her daughter with her, and returning to her beloved home in Ireland, Donegal. She had all but given up hope when a vision of a man appears to her at her favorite haven of peace. She knows it is but a dream though, having dreamed of him before, but never finding this man who stirred her heart and soul. So imagine her stunned reaction upon meeting her dream man in the flesh, as the newest of her husband's swordsmen.<br /><br />Alistair and Deirdre are stunned to find they dream partner in the flesh, but they can do nothing about their passion for each other as she is married and Alistair believes he is a walking dead man. How else could he have escaped the slaughter that stole Ian from him, as well as all of Ian's men? When Brodie ends up missing and presumed dead from a skirmish, Deirdre decides now is her time to escape, especially since Brodie's father is determined to marry her to his other son, Kinnon. Alistair leaves about the same time and he and Deirdre end up making the journey together. Now nothing stands in the way of their being together, except his morbid belief that Death is stalking him.<br /><br />When escape appears impossible, they end up in the home of the Kirallens, the laird near death, and Alistair must finally come to terms with his obsession. He has been haunted by a recurring nightmare, reliving the day Ian was killed, and he is convinced there is meaning to this dream, though he can't find it. But when he comes back into the fold of the Kirallens, many believe him a traitor still and danger is around every corner for himself, Deirdre, and Jemmy. Will Alistair resolve his plight before he loses Deirdre forever? And will he uncover the meaning of his dream before the danger stalking them all, calls them all to death alongside Ian?<br /><br />Ms. English had a tough job on her hands here, making this reviewer come around on the opinion held of Alistair. He was not at all liked in The Border Bride, coming across as \\"far too bitter, and a bit too power hungry\\" as quoted from the review written. But she does a wonderful job of redeeming him, and making it understood just why he felt the way he did.  Admittedly, it takes most of the book to succeed in this, but that is the idea of a character-driven novel, for the characters to grow and change through their relationships with others.<br /><br />Once again the book is richly detailed and a very colorful rendering of Scotland is presented. There is even a tough of the paranormal in this story, as seen through Alistair's foreboding dreams. A very impressive sophomore effort by Ms. English, and her talent is no less evident here, in fact it is more noticeable and growth seen. One can't help but fall in love with her characters and the accounts of their adventures. The reader will be left wanting, not because this story was disappointing, it isn't in the slightest, but wanting to read more about the Kirallen clan and their friends.<br /><br />Rich details, captivating people, plenty of adventure and expectations for more, have become trademarks of Ms. English's novels. This reviewer would love to see more and watch her talent for creating beautiful stories grow and change, to an even more captivating story. Kudos to Ms. English for penning a delight and making even this reader fall in love with Alistair.e slightest, but wanting to read more about the Kirallen clan and their friends.

What was supposed to be a romantic getaway for two turns into the trip from hell when Robert brings his obnoxious, scheming daughter, Gloria, with them, and them abandons Dougless in a Church in Ashburton, without even her purse! This being the worst in a string of bad luck lasting her whole life, Dougless breaks down, sobbing her heart out on the tomb of an English Earl from the 16th century who was to have been executed for treason.<br />1564<br />Nicholas Stafford, Earl of Thornwyck, is sitting in his prison cell, writing a letter to his mother, three days before he is to be executed for treason. Suddenly, he hears a woman sobbing as though her life is over. Try as he might to ignore it, this woman's cries overwhelm him to the point he can think of nothing else. The next thing he knows, he is standing in a Church, in front of his own tomb and face to face with Dougless.<br />Nicholas has come forward over 400 years in time, to solve a mystery. He had been wrongly accused of treason and needs to find out who his betrayer was.  Dougless is in disbelief, thinking Nicholas is crazy when he tells her his tale. She was never one to turn her back on one in need though, so as she helps him find his way around, she comes to believe in the impossible, and finds herself falling in love with her own personal knight in shining armor.<br />However, as Nicholas and Dougless fall deeper in love, fate beckons once again. Nicholas is taken back to his time to face his execution, nonetheless. Dougless can't give up hope though, in spite of their seeming failure to save him from death. Now the impossible happens once again, sending Dougless back in time herself, to try and prevent the chain of events leading to the execution from occurring. Shock of shocks though, Nicholas does not remember her and in fact, he despises her! Can Dougless convince Nicholas her story is true, in time to prevent his death?<br />It is easy to see why Knight in Shining Armor remains a fan favorite of Ms. Devereaux's books. She takes a classic romance theme and alters it entirely, making it entirely her own. The plot flows seamlessly, capturing and carrying the reader along. She also weaves a lot of interesting trivia bits in, without detracting from the story, and gives a clearer picture of life in Elizabethan England.<br />The characters grow dramatically throughout as well. Dougless starts out as a weakling who will do anything to make someone happy, but by the end of the story, she has come into her own. She overcomes her feelings of inferiority to become a woman full of quiet strength and confidence. Nicholas starts off as a scoundrel, a womanizer, and a philanderer. As the story moves along, he is seen for the noble man he is... one who puts honor and family above all else, even himself and his dreams.<br />Whether enjoying this book for the first or the dozenth time, it is enchanting, guaranteed not to disappoint.

From the moment she arrived, this place felt like home: she felt like she belonged. It was the perfect place for her to begin a new life. In a town where secrets and legends were a way of life, she fit right in... for she had a few secrets of her own - the biggest being that she has no memory of her life up to shortly before arriving in town.<br /><br />Dr. David Bryson is a recluse, hideously scarred in the explosion that took his fianc'e, Tasha Pierce, from him five years ago. Many of the townsfolk thought him to be responsible for Tasha's death, and almost all of them believed him to be crazy. He hid himself in his home, The Bluffs, and in the shadows, never allowing anyone to see his deformities in the light of day. He believed he would never again care for someone as deeply as he did for Tasha, until Becca came to town.<br /><br />Becca is drawn to David, for reasons she cannot fathom. So when he proposes she come to his home to work for him, she can't resist the opportunity to meet the man whose velvet voice haunts her dreams. Everyone tries to convince her to stay away from David, saying he's dangerous, but Becca goes anyway. Once she meets him, and finds he is all she expected and more, nothing can keep her away. He is obsessed with her, and against his better judgment, asks her to live in his home while she is working there.<br /><br />When dead bodies of young women start turning up, the town fears the serial killer from 20 years ago has struck again. It soon becomes apparent that Becca is the next intended victim, and David will do whatever is necessary to protect her. At the same time, Claire Cavendish, who escaped the killer five years ago with her mind shattered, starts to remember what happened to her, making her a target as well. Will they find the killer before it is too late for Becca and Claire?<br /><br />Ms. Wayne does a first-rate job of bringing the saga of Moriah's Landing to a close, all the while not allowing Becca and David's story to take a backseat to the big picture. One can't help but feel the electricity between the two of them as they both try to come to terms with their issues: Becca convinced David is too obsessed with Tasha, and David still feeling the pain of losing the love of his life, and the guilt that he couldn't save her. David is torn between his loyalty to Tasha and his undeniable attraction to Becca. The solution to these problems is shocking and unexpected.<br /><br />The suspense never lets up of the underlying mystery throughout all four books. The reader is sucked in, eager for the twists and turns the mystery takes, which lead right up to the dramatic conclusion. As Claire slowly remembers what happened to her on the fateful night that changed the lives of those four women, one will cheer for her and the strength she finds, to face her inner demons and brush aside the veil on her memory. Behind the Veil is an engrossing read which is far from disappointing. Pick up a copy today, as well as the other three books in the mini-series, they are all not-to-be-missed.

Years at war have honed him into a hard, cunning man. But very few know of his secret life as a spy, so genius is he at his deceit. He is one of the best, respected by his fellow spies, but shunned by the one person who means the most to him, his twin brother Damien. That is, until an innocent young woman stumbles into his private sanctuary....<br /><br />Alice Montague swore to her brother on his deathbed that she would always watch out for his young wife and their son. This vow is what brings her to Lucien's den of depravity where he does much of his work, to return her sister-in-law, Caro, to her son Harry, who is ill. Alice is appalled when she arrives at Lucien's home and enters into his private Grotto. Lucien is intrigued by Alice and forces her into a deal with the devil, making her spend a week in his home, alone with only Lucien and his servants there.<br /><br />Alice vows to resist Lucien's allure, going home as innocent as she arrived. Unfortunately for her, he is very good at his seductive game and she falls under his spell and in love with this mysterious man. Lucien finds himself in love with Alice as well, but she does not yet know of his secret life as a spy. He is afraid to tell her the truth, for fear she will spurn him as his brother did.<br /><br />While Alice and Lucien are growing closer, so is an evil adversary from Lucien's secret life, the only man who was ever to break him, Claude Bardou. Bardou has been hired for a mission of destruction in London, but his personal task is to destroy Lucien. He must find Bardou before the man can carry out his plans and he will also finally get to seek his revenge against his most vile of enemies. Will Lucien defeat Bardou once and for all and find happiness with Alice? Will she accept his other life or will it turn her against him?<br /><br />Ms. Foley's talent is all the more evident with every book she writes and this novel is no exception. Her characters are so full of life and so real that one almost expects to see them walking down the street. Lucien and Alice have such an incredible relationship that starts out rocky, and stays that way until they learn to accept each other for who they are, faults and all. When Lucien finally admits his true feelings to her, his love and agony are so strong and he is so vulnerable, it actually brought tears to they eyes of this reviewer.<br /><br />The action in this story never ends either.

US	52934870	R7MJ17H1W7T8G	0373029322	251958859	Heart's Treasure (Harlequin Romance, No. 2932)	Books	1	0	1	N	N	An unimpressive read	I was not overly impressed with this book. The heroine is rather weak and doesn't seem to have much common sense. The hero was portrayed much better but still not overly exceptional. The conflict between them seemed pretty contrived and was not a very strong one. Come on now, the only conflict between them was that the heroine could not admit that her father's work was not always perfect. The whole discord between them was based on the fact that Jacques, the hero, contradicted the heroine, Rylla's fathers points in an educational paper he wrote.<br />Also, the book was supposed to be focused around a search for a lost Incan city and treasure. That was only a minor part of the book. Over half of the book was preparations to go on the expedition and break through the jungle. The actual Incan city when they found it, was only featured in a total of maybe 10 pages r so out of the whole book. I would have preferred to see more of the focus be on the lost city itself.<br />Rylla was TSTL (too stupid to live) in parts too. She goes wandering off in the jungle all alone, during the rainy season and surprise, surprise, gets lost, needing rescued by Jacques. How dumb can a person be to do something like that? And on top of that, she damages her hands by touching exotic plants she knows nothing about, which give her blood poisoning. THEN, she is afraid to tell the rest of the expedition crew of illness, which could have seriously jeopardized the lives of all of them.<br />Needless to say, I guess you can tell I wasn't fond of this one? Not worth the read in my opinion. This book will be dumped in the garbage; I have no desire to read it again and can't believe I actually finished it at all!	2002-10-04

Elizabeth found them both, almost as if the killer intended for that to happen. Both corpses had also been drained entirely of blood and carefully preserved. It appears that a serial killer is on the loose and Cullen and Elizabeth must work together to solve the mystery, before the murderer can strike again.<br /><br />Elizabeth has secretly been in love with Cullen for years, but he still sees her as no more than a child, or does he? When the killer targets Elizabeth for his macabre plans, Cullen must use every ounce of skill he possesses to protect her, all the while finding himself fascinated with the attractive young woman she has become. Are these latest murders the victim of a legendary ghost said to rise every five years? Are they linked to Claire's abduction and a series of murders from 20 years ago? Will Elizabeth and Cullen solve the mystery, save her life, and be together?<br /><br />This introduction to the town of Moriah's Landing is a unique and delightful story. Ms. Stevens shows her magic of writing tales to snare the reader. She weaves intrigue, believable characters, legends and emotion together seamlessly for an engrossing read. Myth and logic come together, drawing one into the lives of the townspeople, leaving the reader to beg for more.<br /><br />Several plot lines are left unanswered, assumed to be resolved in one of the three books continuing the series. One warning however, expect the unexpected when entering Moriah's Landing. This reviewer enjoyed her visit and looks forward to returning again later.ory.

Woman (Red Dress Ink)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Small town girl finds single life in the big city	Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />Sarah Walker has just moved to LA for her fianc', Benjamin. She has no job, no money, but she moved into an apartment with the expectation he would be living with her and covering the expenses while she took her time finding a job she really liked. When Benjamin bails out on her at the last minute, she is stuck, having no idea what to do next.<br /><br />Sarah decides to take on a roommate, Martika, to help foot the bills while she searches for her dream job... and a new life as a single woman in the city. What she finds is a string of go-nowhere jobs where she is overworked, underpaid, and extremely miserable. Her social life is nil and she finds out how totally unprepared for city life she was.<br /><br />No problem! Martika steps in, making Sarah her pet project. She'll create a new image and a new lifestyle for small-town Sarah, pulling out all the stops. Sarah is uncomfortable at first, but finds herself adapting and actually enjoying her new life, even putting Martika to shame. Single life in the city turns down home girl into a party princess.<br /><br />This is a cute funny read, giving a wild taste of what being a single woman in a big city can really be like. Written in wit and style of Sex and the City or Seinfeld, it is a hilarious look at life in the real world, where men and women alike are far from perfect. Sarah starts out as a shy wallflower type, with her life plan set in stone, and turns into a smart sassy, wise-cracking woman who isn't afraid to speak her mind loud and clear, and throws out that former life plan and decides to just \\"wing it.\\"<br /><br />Sarah's friends are wacky and loveable. There is brassy Martika who revels in her singledom, and Tika's best friend Taylor. Then there are Kit, who is just plain normal; and Judith, an uptight straitlaced wife to her lawyer husband who finds her life lacking when she strikes up an online romance that helps her realize what she needs. The reader can't help but hope to see a couple of these characters (especially Judith or Martika for this reviewer) pop back up in a story all their own later on.<br /><br />If wild exploits and off the wall humor in every day life is what one is looking for, Ms. Yardley's story is the one of choice.

In order to achieve this, he decides to wed the oldest sister of the Graham family head. Robert enters into this agreement, much to the dismay of his entire clan, swearing to do whatever is necessary to make the alliance a happy one.<br />Caroline Graham is furious with her brother for signing her life away to the hated Maxwells. She has been convinced all her life no man would ever want her, the ugly sister, and she had planned to give herself to the Church as a nun. So she enters into this marriage determined to keep her icy demeanor (and her maidenhead) intact and show Robert just how unsuitable she was for a wife.<br />Robert is pleased when he meets Caroline and sets a course of seduction to convince her she is neither the ugly duckling she believes herself to be, nor the nun she desires to be. Caroline's walls are gradually beaten down by a very determined Robert, and she finds herself falling for him, all the while convinced he couldn't possibly love her.<br />An ancient legend stands in their way, however. There is a magical stone, taken from the scabbard of the legendary Excalibur, said to protect the possessor from harm. This stone is the basis for the nasty feud, and the cause of a deadly massacre 60 years previous. Problems escalate again upon the marriage of Robert and Caroline, as her greedy brother wants the stone for his own.<br />Can Caroline and Robert overcome their fears and plaguing doubts? Will their binding relationship put an end to the feud forever as legend proclaims?<br />Ms. Holling has woven an intricate tale of passion, greed, and vengeance. This book runs the gamut of emotions and desire. The characters are engaging, though it took this reviewer a while to warm up to Caroline. The plot is seamless and the legend of Excalibur is worked in effortlessly. The story is slow going for the first few chapters, but once it picks up, the reader will not be disappointed.<br />One will be eagerly waiting to see how the rest of the story pans out in successive books.

Her father had been declared a traitor many years ago, forfeiting his wealth to the Crown, and causing Lynette to be disinherited. Riley, her mother, would do anything to ensure a secure marriage for her, dowry or not. Now Richard, guardian to the young King Edward, wants Lynette brought to court. In an act of sheer desperation, Riley goes to an old friend on his deathbed, begging him to sign a marriage contract, binding his son, Devon Seward, to Lynette. Under questionable behavior, Riley gets the contract signed, securing Lynette's future.<br />Lynette has plans of her own though. She loves Malcolm, one her family's servants, and they desire to be wed. Her plans are halted upon her betrothal to Devon, but she vows she will marry no one if she cannot have the man she loves. So she runs off, hiding out in the woods until she can find her way to a convent. Lynette revels in her freedom, short-lived though it may be.<br />Devon is shocked and angered to hear of his father's final act, having no desire to marry right now, especially the daughter of the infamous traitor. He knows she is his responsibility though, at least until he can find her another husband. He goes to the woods in search of her, and is fascinated with the beautiful wood sprite that is Lynette. She mistakes him for a common hunter, enlisting his help in her bid for freedom. Lynette is surprised to find herself falling for this mysterious hunter. When she finds out he is her intended, she is furious with him for tricking her.<br />Lynette and Devon are soon married and she discovers it is not so awful after all. She falls in love with her husband, and he loves her, though he doubts her integrity.<br />The times keep them apart however, as this is a very turbulent time for England. Richard has imprisoned Prince Edward, heir to the throne, and is making plans to steal it away from Edward. He is not the only one vying for the coveted crown; Henry Tudor is in love with Princess Elizabeth and vows to marry her. England is in an uproar, as is Devon's household, with factions supporting Henry, and others for Richard, who is killing any and all suspected of treason. Devon is opposed to Richard's plans, fighting them in secret, until a traitor in his household exposes Devon, putting his and Lynette's marriage, and Devon's life, at serious risk of death.<br />Ms. Davidson has written a fascinating story, capturing the essence of the times. Here is a tale full of intriguing plot developments and lots of drama. The focus of this book is more on the happenings, and how Devon and Lynette react and cope with them, adding depth and growth to their relationship.<br />This book is not a light read, requiring good amounts of concentration, to follow the story line fully, but it is well worth the extra time taken to read it.

He was from the future, where sex is the hottest spectator sport, and he was the MVP. He was at the peak of his career and no one could match him. So why was he starting to feel worn out, used up, burned out? Brian decides to take a long vacation to a simpler time, traveling back to present day Ireland, where he plans to rebuild his ancient family keep.<br /><br />Ally O'Neil is a recently divorced woman and a best selling author of a series of books on how to be the perfect wife. She is in Ireland on a research trip to help her Aunt Katy write a book on the paranormal legends and beings of the country. They travel to an old castle rumored to be haunted, where they run into Brian. Ally is attracted to him, but refuses to have anything more to do with him then absolutely necessary, especially since she is feeling like a fraud. She is  famous for her tips to women on how to treat their husbands, so why couldn't she keep her own husband interested? Her hands off approach gets to Brian, making him long to break the \\"no sex in the off season\\" clause in his contract.<br /><br />Ally decides to use Brian as an advisor on her next book, about life as a single woman looking for love (and sex). Brian agrees to help her, all the more intrigued by the challenge of a woman who wants nothing to do with him physically. The more time they spend together, the more Ally desires to get closer. So she decides to seduce him... all in the name of research, of course. Brian however, is not the only time traveler. Numerous others followed him back, as they all have a vested interest in his livelihood. There are also several seemingly suspicious accidents, interfering with Ally's plans. Brian and Ally have their work cut out for them if they ever plan to be together.<br /><br />Ms. Bangs has created a delightful romp in this story. It is truly a unique and racy premise. Brian and Ally have enough sparks to ignite a forest fire, from the first moment they meet, when she runs screaming from him, having mistaken him for a legendary \\"vampire.\\" Ally's aunt is a riot, adding lots of laughs with her views on life. All of Brian's acquaintances from the future add a note of hilarity as well, with all of their conflicting agendas and their reactions to the times.<br /><br />This book has it all, everything a reader could possibly hope for in a romance novel. Lots of conflict, humor, a little mystery, and of course some wild sex abound. There is even a good bit of the paranormal present, what with Katy's search for ghosts, time-travelers aplenty, aliens, and shape shifters. This will appeal to just about everyone. Fans of the likes of Sandra Hill will love this book, for its brand of humor. Ms. Bangs is on a roll, bound to become a star of the genre.

She is a small town girl with big city dreams. She swears she will only marry a rich man who can give her the exotic life she has always longed for. She believes in fate and magic and faery legends, but who wouldn't when living a life in the small Irish town of Ardmore, where legends are a matter of course?<br /><br />Trevor Magee is an Irishman who was raised in the US by his exceedingly practical parents. He comes to Ardmore to build a theatre, and learn more about his family history and what caused them to abandon their roots. He is happy to meet the Gallagher clan and is brought into their fold. When he first sees Darcy in a window, he is fascinated by her beauty and is determined to get to know her.<br /><br />Trevor and Darcy are mutually attracted and agreeable to having a fling. Darcy has no interest in love, only money and fame; Trevor doesn't believe in love, but is willing to shower Darcy with riches and adventure. The more they are together, the more they are drawn to each other, until their agreement is no longer enough. With the help of Carrick the faery prince and his lady love who is now a ghost, maybe Trevor and Darcy will come together and realize their real dreams are in fact each other.<br /><br />This conclusion to the Gallagher trilogy is definitely not the best of the three. It is in fact, extremely disappointing. Darcy is very shallow, caring only about money and fame and flaunting them both. When she was a minor character in the other two books, this was tolerable, when she is the heroine, it is annoying. All through the story, she made it very clear to Trevor that was all she wanted from him, nothing more. Until she started to fall in love with him... Then suddenly she gets angry when that is all he is giving her, though she never told him her feelings had changed and that she now wanted more. She expected him to be a mind reader and got mad when he wasn't. Her only saving grace is her love for her family. It is obvious how much she cares about them and is evident she would do anything for them. Trevor tries hard to meet her desires, even when he comes to realize he wants more then her gratitude. He goes out of his way to accommodate what she had originally desired and is confused when she isn't happy with that anymore. Trevor is seen for the good man he is, all the way to the end, but Darcy never redeems herself, in this reviewer's opinion.<br /><br />Also disappointing was the conclusion of the underlying story woven throughout the entire trilogy...the story of Carrick and Gwen. They both only played minor roles in all three books, but the reader comes to love them both and hope for the curse placed by Carrick, in a moment of sorrow and anger, to be broken. Much build-up to their story's conclusion was given, and more was expected then was granted. Their saga's end is brushed over, added almost as an afterthought, where this reviewer would have liked to see a better climactic ending.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, July 2002.

Someone in Moriah's Landing has been ordering illegal medical supplies, rumored to be needed by a secret society of scientists dating back to the 1600s.  He has tried to find out what happened to the agent who was originally on the case, until he disappeared.<br /><br />Katherine \\"Kat\\" Ridgemont is a native of Moriah's Landing, and the local private investigator. She also happens to be haunted by her mother's murder 20 years ago, a victim of a serial killer who was never found. Kat bears more than a passing resemblance to her mother. As the anniversary of her death approaches, Kat starts to have a recurring nightmare from her childhood, and starts to feel as though something is about to happen.<br /><br />From the moment Jonah stumbles into Kat's office and is mistaken for her blind date, they are attracted to each other. Jonah has a secret though, and he is sure Kat would want nothing to do with him if she knew what it was. Something evil is after Kat, and Jonah senses it, knowing he will do whatever is necessary to protect her. If he can't Kat will fall victim to the same fate as her mother did.<br /><br />This second installment in the Moriah's Landing miniseries for the most part does not disappoint. It is a stand alone book from the rest of the series, but reading all four together and in order, will help one to understand the underlying mystery throughout. The readers get to pay a return visit to some interesting characters from the first book, as well as get introduced to some new ones.<br /><br />Also, a little more is revealed about the story of Claire, which was introduced in the beginning. Claire is, in fact, probably one of the most intriguing characters of the series, as one journeys along with her as she re-enters the world and tries to remember what happened to her five years before.<br /><br />Kat and Jonah are wonderful together, balancing each other's faults and strengths, so they are all the stronger for it, together. One thing that is never fully explained however, is why suddenly Kat's nightmares from childhood come back when they do. Many reasons are given for why that is the case, but it is hard to understand why this did not happen in past years on the anniversary of her mother's death. One is led to believe it is partially due to the string of recent murders in the town, hinting at a return serial killer, but if that is the case, one might think her memories would have started to surface after Claire's abduction when they were in college together.<br /><br />In spite of that, the story sucks the reader in and will have one eager to finally get the answers to the mysteries surrounding Moriah's Landing. It also nicely sets up the next story in the series, SCARLET VOWS, which was released in May 2002.  Read all four for the full tale. One will enjoy the complexities of each as an individual story, and all of them as a whole.are all the stronger for it, together.

The members of each clan have been taught their entire lives to hate and destroy the other. Finally Laird Kirallen grows weary of the war and decides it is time for peace. He proposes the marriage of his only remaining son to Darnley's beloved daughter. Darnley grudgingly agrees, but not for the same reasons as Kirallen.<br /><br />Jemmy Kirallen left home over twelve years ago to go to sea and never expected to return home. Upon receiving word his brother Ian was killed because of the feud, he hastens home to assist his elderly father in ruling the clan. He never expected to be returning to a wedding, especially his own. Jemmy too, is tired of the feud, having left all those years ago to escape it once and for all. He reluctantly goes along with his father's plan, all in the name of peace.<br /><br />Darnley agreed to the marriage under duress, planning to use it to destroy the Kirallens once and for all. He refuses to marry his darling Maude to the heathen, so he blackmails his illegitimate daughter, Alyson, into posing as Maude and marrying Jemmy. Alyson agrees to it only to save her little brother's life, never expecting to be there for very long... and certainly never anticipating she would fall in love with her husband!<br /><br />His beautiful new bride intrigues Jemmy, and that reinforces his desire for peace. What he can't understand is her seemingly abrupt personality changes, from ice queen to a woman of fire and passion. Alyson was pleasantly surprised upon meeting her husband and finds herself drawn to him in ways she cannot begin to comprehend. But he can never be hers, for she must continue her charade of pretending to be Maude, even though she grows tired of living a lie. The more she gets to know Jemmy, the more her acting slips and her own personality sneaks out...and the more she longs to tell the truth.<br /><br />This was an impressive debut effort by Ms. English. Her talent is evident in her ability to weave a remarkable story. Scotland is beautifully rendered with vivid imagery. The web of deceit strung between the characters adds to the tale, as they try to resolve differences and get on with their lives. Jemmy and Alyson's relationship moves along well through the story. Ms. English captures the very spirit of the Scottish people, depicting them very true to the time.<br /><br />There were a few problems with the book, this first being some very poor editing, which is not the fault of the author. However, it has a tendency to detract from the story in parts. Also, Maude starts to be redeemed a little suddenly in the end and it does not quite seem true to her character. Alistair, Jemmy's foster brother, is far too bitter, and a bit too power hungry.

He needed to make a new start in a new place. So he purchased a rundown bar in hopes to begin with that. Sinjin has sworn off all relationships with women beyond mere pleasure, convinced it is too painful to love and lose.<br />Vivian Carrington is mourning the loss of her best friend in the world. She has a rude awakening, realizing her own life got off track somewhere and she is not t he person she always longed to be. Her life is empty and meaningless, making her wonder who would miss her if she were the one who died. Vivian decides to go find herself and ends up in New Orleans, in the mysterious Sinjin's bar.<br />Vivian is in New Orleans to research a book her good friend is writing, truly enjoying the work and her time alone. She is in no mood to get involved in any new relationships with anyone, let alone a man too sexy for his own good. Sinjin isn't looking to get involved with anyone either, but something about Vivian fascinates him and he can't get her out of his mind. When he approaches her and she spurns his advances, he is all the more intrigued by this one woman who won't give him the time of day.<br />Vivian is attracted to Sinjin, despite her efforts to ignore him. When one of Sinjin's hostesses in the bar is injured, Vivian pitches in to lend a helping hand. She is surprised to find she enjoys the job, and the close contact to Sinjin that comes along with it. The longer she continues to fill in and get to know him, the more her defenses are broken down.<br />Vivian's peace of mind is short lived, unfortunately. There are many secrets in the New Orleans underworld, secrets she could never begin to comprehend or believe, not the least of which is Sinjin's own secret about who he really is. When those same secrets bring danger to Vivian, he must do what he can to protect her. Now he has to decide if he should tell her the truth and risk Vivian turning away from him in horror. Will she be able to accept him as he is and commit to an eternity of his love?<br />This sixth installment in Ms. Wilder's SHADOW DWELLERS series shows the saga is far from over. With the introduction of yet more characters and subplots, it is apparent the stage is being set for future adventures. Various paranormal and immortal beings are found throughout: witches, vampires, werecreatures, and many more.

He was full of hopes and dreams as he set out, never expecting the horror he would find one night. He and his knight's band came across a sight from their nightmares...a whole village burned, animals slain, the entire population slaughtered. He has never forgotten that sight, not the young girl he rescued and turned over to a peasant couple to raise as their own. He remembers the young orphan's beautiful but haunted green eyes when he gave her his own cross for comfort.<br /><br />Upon returning to his homeland after a decade away, Sir Royce, now a knight of the realm, realizes he made a grievous error that fateful night in Vaux. The orphan is not a commoner, but is in fact Lady Juliana Mandeville, young noblewoman and the sole heiress to her family's fortune. Royce goes on a quest to right this wrong, at the request of Juliana's dying grandfather.<br /><br />Juliana does not remember much from that night which changed her life irrevocably. All she can recall is a young man who rescued her, and the cross he gave her, the only link she has to that elusive memory. She does not believe Royce when he comes for her, and is furious with him when he takes her away from the Church steps, just as she is about to be married.<br /><br />Juliana fights Royce every step of the way, but he will not be deterred from his mission. Mishaps and misadventures abound as she tries time and again to escape. Royce keeps right on going, feeling guilty over his past error. She has never quite given up hope that her squire would one day return to her. As they journey onward, their feelings for each other grow, and Juliana gets the sneaking suspicion she and Royce have met before though she is unsure where or when.  Slowly she starts having flashes of another time, but are they longings for happiness again, or her memories of her early years of life returning?<br /><br />Ms. Kirkwood has written a medieval tale that will touch the heart. Royce and Juliana have a bond neither fully understands and as a result, they fear it. Juliana's suppressed memories are very realistic for someone suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, as is the way they gradually start to return. Royce is ever the honorable and vigilant knight, putting the safety of his lady before his own.<br /><br />The colorful cast of characters, including King John and his young queen, the men and ladies of court, the travelling minstrel, and the villagers from the town Juliana has called home, all add to the story. It was also nice to see King John portrayed slightly different then history paints him. Juliana starts off as a spoiled young lady, but then who wouldn't after being taken away from all she has ever known and loved...twice!<br /><br />There is plenty of emotion in the book also. Juliana and Royce's exploits on their journey, and at the castle, provide plenty of laugh out loud moments. One will cry along with them as they experience the horrid night at Vaux, which alters everyone's life permanently. One mark of a truly good book is one that makes the reader experience all emotion first hand, and this one does just that. This is a keeper for anyone who loves a heart-rending tale.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, 2002. All rights reserved.l touch the heart.

Both of her parents were killed in the explosion, which was caused by one of her father's experiments. She was raised by her Godfather and learned to adapt to her new life, void of all sound. When her hearing is restored by an experimental surgery, developed at Coastal Island Research Park (CIRP) where her father once worked. CIRP is a compound dedicated to scientific research of many kinds and she is thrilled to receive the treatment there, which gives her the opportunity to hear what she had been missing for so long.<br /><br />Adam Black is a Savannah cop, tough as nails and one of the best. His parents died when he was young and he raised his younger sister, Denise, entirely on his own. Except for her, he has spent his life alone, ever since the woman he loved, a witness in one of his cases and under his protection, was killed. Adam blamed himself, swearing to never get involved with a woman again... until Sarah comes along.<br /><br />The very day Sarah awakens from her surgery, sounds she hadn't heard in many years bombarded her, bringing her joy, short-lived though it is. She overhears something no one should have - the sounds of a woman being abducted from the hospital where Sarah is recovering. No one at the compound believes her, so she takes her fantastic story to the police. No one there believes her at first either, but Adam finds himself intrigued by the attractive young woman. When he realizes Denise, who happens to work at CIRP, is missing, he begins to take her story more seriously.<br /><br />In the midst of their investigation into Denise's whereabouts, they find out about suspicious deaths of other researchers at CIRP, ones who were about to have breakthroughs that would have had a huge impact on medical science. However, someone else knows what Sarah heard was real, and they will do whatever it takes to silence her - permanently. Now Adam and Sarah are racing to find Denise before it is too late for her... and Sarah. He is drawn to her through it all, even though he is terrified that history will repeat itself for him.<br /><br />This story is a captivating look into the dark side of medical research, giving a \\"What if\\" feel in many ways, where research for the advantage of everyone can be capitalized on for the benefit of a few.  Unfortunately, the rising body count as suspects are killed off, makes it appear that perhaps Ms. Herron did not know what to do with the characters. The false leads the killer tries to set may fool some readers, but this reviewer wasn't taken in; having had the murderer figured out, almost from the beginning, though not the motive.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it was a gripping story to keep one engrossed and awaiting the next book in the series.rmanently.

She has managed to keep secret who the father is, afraid of what the town's reaction would be to the truth. She has her life on track; working towards her college degree, keeping a full-time job to pay the bills, and raising Nicole, her pride and joy. Life starts to fall apart though when Brie's mother's cancer returns, inoperable.<br /><br />Drew Pierce is one of the sons of the town's leading family, and is following in his father's footsteps to the life of a politician. He has returned to Moriah's Landing after several years away, to run for mayor. He is the prodigal son returned, who has never quite gotten over the one woman who made his heart sing, the one that got away.<br /><br />When Drew first sees Brie again, he is stunned to feel the twinge of feelings he thought long buried and forgotten. Upon seeing Nicole, he is even more surprised to see his own eyes staring back at him. Now that he has found the daughter he never knew existed, he won't let her or her mother get away again. Brie has loved Drew for as long as she can remember, but she longed for a marriage of hearts, not convenience which is what she feels she is getting.<br /><br />When the wife of well-known research doctor and gene therapy expert, Leland Manning is killed, rumors about \\"whodunit?\\" start to fly. Brie turns to Dr. Manning in desperation for her mother's life, and finds she runs the risk of becoming the next target of the murderer. Drew now has to track down this killer before Brie ends up dead, especially when it appears the same person is after Nicole as well. Who is the killer and why do they want Nicole? Is this the serial killer of 20 years ago returned? Or is it one of the secret society of scientists, who wants Brie and Nicole for their twisted lab experiments? Will Drew and Brie admit their love before it is too late?<br /><br />This third installment in the MORIAH'S LANDING series is another engrossing read. After having met Brie in the previous two books, it was good to see her own story finally. Her entire life revolves around everyone but herself, and especially around her precious daughter. Drew is a pillar of the community, well loved by everyone. He seems slightly reserved at first, though thoughtful of others, but upon finding Brie again...and his daughter, the reader sees the true extent of his emotions and passion for his new family. Brie is fiercely independent and very proud, so much in fact, she has a very hard time accepting help from anyone, especially Drew, who is making his bid for mayor and she feels he doesn't need her situation to cloud people's opinions of him. Dr. Manning is suitably dark and mysterious, the perfect personality for encouraging the wild stories surrounding his secluded lab where he conducts who knows what kind of experiments.<br /><br />Once the real adventure starts, with some unknown stranger stalking Brie and Nicole, the story heats up and the pages turn ever faster.

Her boyfriend, Will, an aspiring actor, is off to Summer Stock without her. She is absolutely crazy about him (maybe even a little bit obsessive) and can't stand the thought of being separated for three long months. Will sure doesn't seem to mind though, and this disturbs her.<br /><br />When all of her suggestions for ways to remain close during that time - going with him, regular visits, phone calls, e-mail, letters - are oh so \\"logically\\" shot down by Will, Tracey decides to grin and bear it, convinced he will miss her as much as she will him, and he will keep in touch as often as he can. After all, he loves her as much as she loves him, doesn't he?<br /><br />Tracey decides to put their three-month separation to good use, so as to surprise him when he returns. She will lose weight, start an exercise program, read classic literature, and save money. When Will comes back he'll be so blown away by the new her that he will never want to be apart again. Or so she believes...<br /><br />With the help of her well-meaning friends and co-workers, and one guy who would be perfect if only he were Will, her quest for the new and improved Tracey takes off with a bang! In the meantime she learns a very valuable lesson...how to love herself.<br /><br />This is a delightfully humorous read, full of belly laughs and groans. Tracey is obsessive about Will, to the point it would be irritatingly pathetic, if not for her quirky sense of humor and her sarcasm. Her friends are a riot, with every one of them having a different idea for how Tracey can reach her summer goals. Her boss is a jerk, but who hasn't had a boss like Jake at some point in their life? Will is the stereotypical self-absorbed bad actor who thinks he is better then he is and feels the whole world should revolve around him.<br /><br />This reviewer, who has had her own share of Wills throughout her own SLIGHTLY SINGLE life, sometimes finds herself praying for Tracey to wake up and smell the cappuccino, and other times cheering for her in her decisions. This book will remind every woman of the string of Mr. Wrongs encountered as they search for their own personal Mr. Rights. It is almost scary how honest and true to life this book is. It is a fun read for a beach day, or a steamy evening in one's own un-air conditioned abode like Tracey's.LY SINGLE life, sometimes finds herself praying for Tracey to wake up and smell the cappuccino, and other times cheering for her in her decisions.

It has long been the dream of her father to find the legendary Avalon. He spent his life in search of the mythical resting place of king Arthur and is getting close to solving the mystery. He has finally figured out where he thinks it is, but his failing health gets in the way. So Regan takes up where he can't and sneaks into the stone circle at Castle Druidhean, where she believes she will find her answers. However, in order to do so, she has to dig...and avoid the castle laird, Mad MacGregor.<br />Lachlen Macgregor has kept to himself for many years. His mother disappeared when he was just a child and he knows more than he should, or has revealed. The secrets are hidden in the stone circle; so when Lachlen finds Regan digging there, he knows he must out an end to her curiosity. He hires her to work at the keep, as a companion to his grandmother, where he can keep a close eye on her...and keep her distracted from digging for secrets.<br />Regan reluctantly agrees to the position at Lachlen's castle, though she is nervous about being in such close proximity to \\"Mad MacGregor\\" as he is called, due to a family curse that all MacGregor men go insane at a young age. Regan figures her living at the castle will give her easy access to the circle for searching for the clues she needs to prove her father's theory about Avalon. Never mind that Lachlen has forbidden her to enter the circle, claiming it is cursed and dangerous.<br />Once Regan arrives at the keep, she realizes that the MacGregor isn't as sinister as she had previously thought. She finds Lachlen charming and pleasant, though distant at times. He is fascinated by her as well, attracted to her and impressed wither intelligence. However, neither can reveal their true reasons for their obsession with the circle, convinced they must keep their secrets. The more they are together, the more they find themselves falling for each other. Though Lachlan refuses to acknowledge it, determined the family curse will end with him. When accidents start happening which endanger Regan's life, the two of them must work together, and decide whether or not to trust each other, if they are to put an end to the curse and threat...and rescue their love.<br />Ms. Hall has written a good story here, in the traditional Gothic style. It has all of the elements; the eerie house, dark brooding hero, family curses, mysterious happenings, and empowered heroine. The novel is for the most part very well done. The characters are vivid and varied, from the disturbing servants, to Regan's bubbly sister and Lachlen's mentally handicapped but cheerful brother. However, Lachlen's \\"Woe is me\\" attitude gets very old and overused, frustrating the reader and causing one to be annoyed with him many times. Also, the misunderstandings about the circle between Lachlen and Regan are dragged out a bit too much at times. But then, if they gave their secrets away, there wouldn't be much of a conflict to keep the story going.<br />The reader is kept guessing as to who is behind the threats to Regan's life...and why; as well as what really happened to Lachlen's mother, known as the \\"The Flame.\\" This reviewer changed opinions many times about who the bad guy is, but pretty much had the mystery of The Flame figured out, but just didn't know why. This book will keep the reader spellbound and hoping to see a sequel, with a chance to revisit some beloved characters.ugh Lachlan refuses to acknowledge it, determined the family curse will end with him.

When she lands a trial column to test her merit, she is thrilled. The topic is unique though she is to give advice to the single in the city by detailing her own quest for Mr. Right by kissing 100 men. Years ago, he grandmother had given her some sage advice, \\"a girl should kiss a hundred men before she marries,\\" and Julie took it to heart.<br /><br />Hunter Matthews is a private investigator, whose like is one of hard facts and concrete evidence. He likes his life planned and predictable, right down to the most minute of details. He also places great importance on honesty and integrity. When he unintentionally costs Julie her job, she comes to him demanding he hire her to make it up to her. So he hires her on as his temporary secretary while his is on her honeymoon. But where Julie is concerned, he has more on his mind then just business.<br /><br />Hunter is hired to try to find the \\"Mystery Kisser\\" the entire city is raving about, for the client's fear over who it is. This provides quite a problem though; since one of the conditions of Julie's test column is that she remains anonymous. At first she isn't overly worried, but as she and Hunter grow closer, she begins to worry about what he would do if he found out about her \\"other life.\\" The closer he gets to cracking the case, the more Julie is torn over whether to reveal herself to him or to keep her secret. What will he do when he finds out the \\"Mystery Kisser\\" is Julie herself? Will he think less of her for not being completely honest with him? Or will he understand her reasons and love her all the more for them?<br /><br />This was an extremely cute story, and very amusing. Julie has had a crush on Hunter since she was a young child and those feelings grew up as she did. She is known for being impulsive which is such an extreme contradiction to Hunter, who has to plan every thing ahead of time. These differences cause many moments throughout the story that add a great hilarity and comedy of errors to several of the cases Hunter is working on. They make a good balance for each other though, one that adds to the lives of both.<br /><br />Ms. Greene provides just the right blend of love, romance, humor, and even a slight bit of suspense to keep the reader interested and turning the pages.

So much so, that when she had the opportunity to go to Scotland as an exchange student, she jumped at the chance. That was several years ago now, and she had been back home in Montana for a while, but the pull Scotland had over her never ended. When she started having dreams again about a dark castle ruin in Tulcairn, she decided once and for all to put the mystery behind her as to why she had spent most of her life dreaming about Moor Castle and a woman who lived a century before.<br /><br />Aidan Ramsey owns the property where Moor Castle rests. His family has lived in Ramsay Hall in the Highlands for many generations and has heard of more then his share of mysterious happenings at the ruins - people disappearing, strange sights and sounds in the vicinity of the castle, and much more. He also has dreamed most of his life of the castle, and one of his ancestors, Quinn Ramsay. When Aidan sees Mae during a tour of his home, he is shocked by her appearance. She looks exactly like his ancestor, Quinn's, wife, Maggie Mae, who disappeared 100 years ago and was never from again.<br /><br />When Mae and Aidan meet, sparks fly from the first, and each is drawn to the other in ways they cannot explain. Also, a resurgence in Mae's dreams, which she learns are about Maggie Mae and Quinn, causes her to be more determined then ever to figure out why she has always been obsessed with Moor Castle. It has an aura of evil and gloom pervading it, so much so that Mae is overwhelmed, and she experiences flashes where she herself is living in the past, feeling Maggie Mae's same fascination with the ruins which may have been her downfall.<br /><br />As Mae and Aidan spend more time together, they find themselves growing closer and closer. They also learn about each others' dreams and eventually come to realize they hold the answers to the mystery of what happened to Maggie Mae. But the evil surrounding Moor Castle is spreading, threatening to consume them both. They must come together to solve the mysteries surrounding Maggie Mae and Quinn, and to put an end to the castle's evil reign. What did happen to Maggie Mae on that long ago night? Did she abandon her husband to be with a lover as some suspected? Or was their something else involved in her disappearance and possible death? Only Mae and Aidan know for sure, and it is locked deep in their subconscious and the only way to draw it out is to face the evil in a fight for their souls on a night exactly like the one in 1898, on which Maggie Mae disappeared forever.<br /><br />Wow!!! This is one intense read. It is extremely fascinating and will keep one engrossed from the very first page, and the introduction to the indomitable Mae Sutton. The theme behind this story is so amazing, it keeps the pages turning. Mae and Aidan are a perfect match, soul mates, if only they can come to terms with their unbelievable circumstances. They engage the reader in their lives, and those of their friends, all the way to the shocking conclusion. It is also different in that their adversary is not the traditional flesh and blood person, but an entity far more complex and indefinable, that is housed in the brooding castle.<br /><br />The underlying reincarnation thread is so well-done, one can't help but believe. The blinking back and forth between past and present should be disconcerting, but it isn't. One understands what is happening in the dreams of Mae and Aidan and has no trouble following the story. This reviewer was blown away by the storyline. There are however, several instances of poor editing, which can be distracting, until one starts to just ignore them, to prevent being pulled out of the story. All in all, a phenomenal book, which has this reviewer eager to go find more works by Ms. Agnew.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, September 2002.

She tackles the subject with ease, handling it well and proving she did her homework for this subject.<br />The characters are well developed and multidimensional. Regan has a big heart, albeit a troubled one, and cares deeply for people. Peter is loveable, though pretty scatterbrained and mysterious. Sam, under his gruff exterior, has a heart of gold, which has been tarnished by his work. Hehas thrived? thrived on his lifestyle for many years, though it has steadily beaten him down. These three, and all the other characters are vivid, lingering in memory long after the last page is turned.<br />Ms. Jones has proven once again that she is a master of romantic suspense, and is on the rise to super stardom in the genre.ng after the last page is turned.<br />Ms. Jones has proven once again that she is a master of romantic suspense, and is on the rise to super stardom in the genre.	2002-10-02

He left home after a bitter argument with his father which put him at odds with his entire family. He has returned to protect his family's estates from pending attacks. Upon returning home, Bayard's grandmother ropes him into finding a bride in exchange for his uncle's estate of Montvieux, which Bayard desires above all else. So he grudgingly goes on a bride quest, for a woman he has never even seen, and is pleasantly surprised by what he finds.<br />Esmeraude of Ceinn-beithe is opposed to the competition for her hand in marriage. She refuses to marry for less then the complete love of her husband and will not settle for a marriage of convenience. So she sets out upon a quest of her own, searching for personal adventure. She issues an additional challenge to her potential suitors, leaving them riddles to lead them to her location, testing their intelligence and commitment.<br />Bayard is bound and determined to win the competition against the other knights, which include his younger brother and his cousins, even before seeing or talking to Esmeraude. When he finds her on her adventure, disguised as a common maid, he knows immediately who she is. He is intrigued by her wit and intellect, which causes him to desire the marriage for more than the holdings it will secure for him. But he swears he will never allow his life to be ruled my emotions, especially love.<br />Esmeraude was immediately attracted to Bayard, convinced he was the only one for her, when she thought him to be a complete stranger. She is surprised and disappointed, at first, to discover he is one of her suitors on the Bride Quest. Then he tells her he does not believe in love, but wants to marry her because it is mutually beneficial to the both of them. Esmeraude has decided Bayard has one her heart and is the only man for her. So she takes it upon herself to make him admit he loves her before she will agree to be his wife.<br />Ms Delacroix falls flat with this latest tale in the Bride Quest series. Bayard is an overly cocky and disillusioned knight who thinks he is always right and that he is the greatest knight around. He can't understand how any woman could possibly be uninterested in him.  He treats his family poorly, even to the point of trying to steal his cousin's inheritance out from under him. In the end, he starts to come around and even admits he may have been wrong in the past. However he never quite redeems himself to be worthy of winning the quest, in this reviewer's opinion.<br />Esmeraude is a young lady who has dreams beyond what is expected of women in her time and wants to have some fun and a lasting marriage full of love. She is a dreamer who wants everyone else to dream too. When she sets her heart and mind on Bayard, she doesn't give up and goes after what she wants, not giving up.<br />The plot is rather limited, revolving more around the characters than excitement and action in the story. There were some good side stories going on throughout as well, with an enchanted vine and yet another marriage being made while Esmeraude and her knights are on their quests.<br />This tale is not a favored one of this reviewer and not a \\"keeper\\" though it did have some finer points to it.

Win is the man her very heart desires, but can she overcome her hears from her modern life to stay with him forever?<br /><br />This was a cute story with a unique method of time travel being used. The attraction between Win and Julia is immediate, much to the dismay of Trudy Fletcher, the token \\"spoiled rich girl\\" character, who wants Win for herself. Julia's performances as the actress everyone mistook her for, are exciting, turning the town on its ear, and adding some truly lively moments to the story.<br /><br />Autumn Lover by Kathryn Fox<br />Leigh Hunter has a high profile career in television production. Suddenly one day it hits her that she takes no joy in life anymore. She purchases a holiday pumpkin and when she holds it, she finds herself transported back to 1899 and in to the life of Matthew Sutton. Leigh is in the body of Matthew's mail-order bride and falling in love with her new husband. Can she remain happy in the past?<br /><br />This was a good story, in spite of the rather lame method of time travel method used. However, Ms. Fox took a tried and true plot and made it her own. Leigh's doubts and fears are portrayed vividly, as is the love Matthew has for his bride. One will fall in love with Matthew and hope for the happy ending he deserves.<br /><br />An Autumn Bouquet by Linda Madl<br />Jennifer Hollis is the public relations manager for the historic Apple Grove House and is there for her wedding, hoping the publicity will help prevent it from being destroyed for a theme park.

Now to decide, should she stay or should she return home? And, whatever will she do about Bennett?<br /><br />This was probably the favorite story of this reviewer, in this book. It was a lovely story, even in spite of the sometimes violent background of the Civil War. There is plenty of passion between the characters, and Jen's dilemma just adds to it. But this is one story that reminds the reader that fate often finds a way all of its own, to make a person's dreams come true.<br /><br />All in all, this was a delightful volume of stories which take place during one of the best times of the year... the chill air and beautiful scents and sounds of yet another Timeless Autumn.

She had been at the top of her game as a supermodel until the rough life got to her. Drugs, alcohol, and anorexia had all been a part of her life, until the day her now ex-husband slashed her face with a razor knife, putting a halt to her career. She realized her ways of life had to change... And what better way to start over then to return to the family her mother had abandoned, taking a young Julienne with her.<br />Morgan Saint-Evanston was suffering in a silent misery of his own making. He is an immortal, from an alternate reality, Sclyd, though born in the world of the mortals, where his practices in the dark arts were welcomed and necessary for his survival. After a violent battle where he nearly destroyed his one time friend and now greatest enemy, Xavier, Morgan abandoned Sclyd, coming to the world of the mortals and swearing off of his use of the occult. Though he escaped his world, he is still an outlaw, and is cursed with an abominable loneliness... and the loss of his soul.<br />When Morgan came to the world of the mortals, he took Julienne's family under his wing. He taught them the ways of magic and the occult in exchange for them keeping his secret and protecting him. Julienne's mother, Cassandra, could not accept the ways of her family, particularly Morgan, and abandoned them, taking an infant Julienne with her. Julienne had little or no memory of her family, except that her mother hated Morgan with every fiber of her being.<br />Now the time has come where the doors between the worlds would be opening, and Julienne's destiny is tied to that. Morgan has tracked her down, at the request of her grandmother, and is returning her to the world that should have been hers. Morgan thinks it is a mistake, but he cannot refuse Julienne's grandmother. Julienne is reborn into her family, infused with Morgan's own blood, without even being aware of what is happening to her. Once the family skeletons are revealed, Julienne embraces their ways, ready to take her place as a powerful priestess. As she is learning everything from Morgan, she finds herself falling in love with him, knowing it is a huge mistake. As events spiral out of control, with the opening of the other worlds, Julienne and Morgan are called over to his world to once again face Xavier, which is their greatest challenge...and maybe their ultimate destruction.<br />This was a very intriguing beginning to the KEEPERS OF ETERNITY series. It is extremely well written and has a fascinating and unique premise. The plot moves along smoothly, keeping the interest of the reader through to the end. The story actually does not end, but just stops, giving a definitely \\"to be continued\\" feel, setting up the next book quite well. One will be very eager to see what happens next.<br />Julienne is a fascinating woman, very weak-willed in her old life, but finding a new strength of purpose upon returning to the home of her birth. She changes and one gets the impression, she does a complete turn around from her old ways. She is disgusted with her ruined face in the beginning, but comes to realize she is still an incredible woman, with a special beauty within that had never been allowed to shine before.<br />Morgan however, is another story. This reviewer had an extremely hard time warming up to him. Be forewarned - he is violent, abusive, downright rude, and drowning himself in liquor every night, as he tries to battle his inner demons. Some people may not enjoy reading parts of the story for that reason. Probably part of the reason for the dislike of Morgan, comes from personal experiences of this reviewer's life, hitting way to close to home for comfort, bringing back bad memories. But most will probably have an easier time accepting him for who he is. As the story progresses though, one finds the true reasons for Morgan's behavior, his isin an agony of life that he cannot control or overcome. His only reaction is to lash out, in hopes to make his own pain recede a little. He does come around in the end, when he realizes how important Julienne is to him, and just how deeply he really does love her.<br />ECHOES OF ANGELS is an exciting saga, crossing from coast to coast, and world to world. Definitely a worthwhile read, it will keep one entranced, waiting with baited breath for the next chapter in the drama.in an agony of life that he cannot control or overcome.

In spite of the vividness of these nightly encounters, she believes they are nothing more than dreams; surely they are not premonitions of things to come. When she comes across an antique scrying mirror in a New Age Boutique, she has to have it, though she can't begin to explain why. She looks into the mirror and sees those same green eyes which have haunted her nights, and suddenly she is seeing a flesh and blood man, with those same eyes. Somehow, Kristy has been magically transported, via her mirror, to a distant past, where anyone even remotely suspected of witchcraft is hunted down and killed as a matter of course.<br /><br />Jared Ramsey is a successful smuggler of goods forbidden in Puritan England. Imagine his surprise when upon returning to his room one night, he finds a lovely woman of unusual speech and dress already there. Even more surprising are her claims that she comes from another time and place! Witchcraft!! She is beautiful, unlike anyone he has known, so it is only natural he come to her rescue, when she is accused of witchcraft. He takes Kristy with him on his travels to unload his cargo and gather information for his greater mission... to return a Stuart to his rightful place on England's throne.<br /><br />Witch hunters and the Lord Protector's police aren't all who on their tail however. A powerful witch, Gwyneth, is after them as well, wanting Kristy's dormant powers for her coven. Hers is one of The Left-Hand Path though, practitioners of black magic and Kristy is terrified of the witch. But Gwyneth has one thing that may lure her to them. Kristy has no memory of the first six years of her life, or her parents. This evil witch claims to have all the answers Kristy has long sought, but will only reveal them when she comes to the coven willingly.<br /><br />Kristy is horrified to hear what the coven wants of her and Jared doesn't know what to believe. He doesn't want to think she is a witch, but.... The more time he spends with Kristy, the more he desires her and wants to believe her, despite his doubts. He finds himself helping her to escape witches and hunters alike. As their journey takes them across England and into Scotland. But there is no escaping such powerful enemies. Will Kristy and Jared overcome the evil they are faced with? And what about her forgotten years? Is she really a powerful witch like Gwyneth claims? Is she descended from a legacy of darkness or light?<br /><br />This was an interesting, though it had a very dark storyline. Anyone who has a hard time hearing about black magic practices should not read this book. There are references to different kinds of sacrifices the witches make, though no specific details or description. This book is all about the struggle of good vs. evil, with lots of romance thrown in.<br /><br />Kristy and Jared's attraction is immediate from the moment they meet, even before that, in her dreams. Jared struggles with his attraction to her, since he has a hard time believing her claims of time travel and that she is not a witch. He is afraid of being drawn into something evil, from which there is no escaping. Before Gwyneth is really introduced, when Kristy is just having visions of her and the mysterious red fog she travels in, one can sense the malevolence in her character, knowing there is something about her that is far from right. Just the descriptions of her appearance and silent actions in the beginning are enough to send chills up the reader spine and cause the hairs on the back of the neck to prickle, leading in to a lot of times where that will happen.<br /><br />This was a good book, giving some interesting details of Puritan life in England, and the time period. It is apparent Ms. Haviland did her research thoroughly for this tale. And fear not,good does triumph over evil in the end, as it should, with an interesting spin on the story line.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, July 2002.

Father and daughter had suffered through a tragedy twenty years ago when Rileys sister, Caroline, and mother died. As a result, she has dedicated her life to her father and his political aspirations, swearing to stay with him through thick and thin. However, things are about to change when suddenly the nightmares from her childhood return.<br />Jake Mahoney is a homicide reporter, only covering the presidential campaign to help out a fellow reporter. He has much better things to do - and far more important leads to follow than listening to a lot of politicking, no matter how attractive he finds the candidates daughter. When an exploding car bomb throws him into her path, and her life, things start to heat up especially when they both show up at the site of a suicide, coincidentally at the same time.<br />Jake and Riley find themselves together quite a bit as events start to unfold, none of which make sense as they try to connect the puzzle pieces to see the whole picture. Through it all, they grow closer, and the attraction they both felt at their initial meeting gets stronger and harder to deny. Riley knows she should not get involved with him, after all he is a reporter, and her father is so close to his most sought after political goal; but she cant resist Jakes magnetism.<br />Rileys father and all of his colleagues are strongly opposed to her involvement with Jake, and he is strongly encouraged by his boss at the paper to stay away from her. However, the two of them are together more and more as the entire mystery starts to unfold, and everything appears to be linked to Caroline and her tragic accident. Someone doesnt want the truth to be revealed, and they will stop at nothing to keep Riley and Jake from figuring it all out.<br />This is an excellent page-turner of a book. Ms. Davis has mastered the art of suspense. There are so many twists and turns throughout that the reader is always kept guessing. This reviewer sure changed her mind repeatedly as to who the villains and victims were, and found the conclusion to be a bit of a shocker.<br />The characters are very well drawn and realistically depicted.

His life was bleak, lacking color and emotion. The only thing that had kept him from turning vampire after all these years had been his dedication to his twin, Gabriel. Lucian had fooled everyone into thinking he had turned, to give his brother a mission to keep from turning himself. Once Gabriel found his lifemate, Lucian was ready to give up, allowing himself to be destroyed. But hope arrives at the last minute, giving Lucian a new reason for living' his own lifemate.<br /><br />Jaxon 'Jaxx' Montgomery is a brilliant and gifted cop, well respected by her fellow officers, and having survived a hellish young life. Her entire family, and anyone she has ever gotten close to, were brutally murdered by a former Navy SEAL, and her late father's best friend, Tyler Drake. She had spent the last several years of her life trying to avoid emotional entanglements with anyone, for fear Drake would fixate on them and start another murderous rampage. Lucian finds in her the one person who could bring color and feeling back into his bleak existence, and therefore refuses to allow her to keep her distance. He needs her and is determined to make Jaxon understand him.<br /><br />When Jaxx and her partner are nearly killed in a drug bust gone bad, Lucian steps in and rescues them, taking her to his home, unwilling to be separated from her. As she recovers from what should have been fatal injuries, Jaxx notices changes in her body, wrought by Lucian's healing and converting of her. She tries to convince him, it isn't safe to be around her, for Drake will stop at nothing, all the while finding herself drawn to Lucian.<br /><br />Lucian and Jaxon's path is not an easy one, for Drake is still out there, stalking them. There are also some very powerful vampires in the area, having been drawn by Jaxon's psychic abilities. Add in a dangerous drug lord, who is not pleased with her team's skills, interfering with his business, and their work is cut out for them, as they try to eliminate all of these threats to their happiness.<br /><br />This book is slightly different from past books in Ms. Feehan's Dark saga, but more than meets the expectations of her numerous fans. Lucian is very unique and this is reflected in the way the story is written. Jaxx is a very strong woman and is a perfect match for the most respected and feared of all Carpathians. He recognizes her special abilities and strengths, causing him to compromise far more than is typical for the males of his species, whose main purpose is to protect their lifemate at all costs. He makes an effort to accommodate her intelligence and her talents, allowing her to participate in dangerous activities where her abilities will help. However in spite of this, Lucian still does not take seriously the threat Drake poses to their lives, causing him to underestimate just what Drake will do.<br /><br />This tale is more plot-driven that most of the Dark series, full of action. But how can it not be, with the various subplots occurring? There is also more violence, due to the nature and number of villains present. One disappointment however, that this reviewer found, is the resolution of the Tyler Drake plotline. It is rather anticlimactic, one having expected more from him after the way he was presented in the story. This leaves the story to not be quite as satisfactory as it could be. In spite of this one issue, the book is fascinating and will keep the pages turning, in to the late hours of the night. The edge-of-the-seat drama keeps one intrigued and not wanting to stop until the story is ended. As always, Dark Guardian leaves the readers begging for more. One will be happy to know this saga is nowhere near complete, and there is still much filed away in Ms. Feehan's imagination for future books and enthralling characters.	2002-10-01

He believes that if she knows the truth about him, and his family, that she would be unable to care for him. Will Gray complete his quest for his own personal Grail? Will Bonnie manage to break through Gray's personal barriers to reach his heart and the love he denies himself?<br /><br />This was a novel full of adventure and passion. Ms. George gain proves her skill at penning a tale to tug at the heartstrings. Gray and Bonnie are full of personality that leaps off the pages. His demons and her fire are always evident. The colorful cast of characters, right down to a cuddly canine, and a rather ugly, but loved no less, pet vulture, entrance the reader, making the story all the more enjoyable.<br /><br />The sometimes overly wordy passages takes getting used to at first, but once familiar with it, it is hardly noticeable. Also, the murder which begins the story takes a back seat to Gray's quest. This reviewer had trouble believing that Bonnie could apparently forget all about her friend's death, thought hat is what appears to happen for most of the story. Other than a few references to Gray's label as \\"murderer,\\" most of the novel no one even thinks about that which started the whole adventure.<br /><br />All in all, this was an exciting story full of emotion, dangers, action, and conflict which is par for the course in the genre.

Elinor's remaining family suspects there was foul play involved in her death, as she was a very healthy woman, expected to live several more years yet. At their request, Mici arranges an exhumation order so an autopsy can be performed on the body.<br /><br />Dr. Rob Craig is the independent doctor hired by Mici to perform the autopsy. He is one of the best and what he uncovers is rather shocking. It turns out Elinor was murdered... by an overdose of nicotine; but when he and Mici take the autopsy results to the police, no one believes that Elinor was murdered. So they set out on their own to uncover the secrets behind this mystery.<br /><br />Their first stop is Elinor's insurance provider, Life Benefits, where they start asking questions regarding Elinor's state of affairs and her insurance plan. The medical director, Dr. Eric Martin, there appears nervous when they arrive, making them suspect something. When his dead body turns up a few days later, right around the time a mysterious package, sent by Dr. Martin just before his death, is stolen from Rob's home, they know they are on the right track.<br /><br />However, there are many unusual circumstances surrounding their investigation, throwing them for a loop. An intruder in Mici's home is the first, threatening her life, and that of Rob, if they continue looking into this issue. Also, some anonymous phone tips lead them in a totally different direction, making them suspect there may be more than one killer on the loose. Conflicting evidence, more suspicious deaths, and continued threats to Mici and Rob's safety, causes them to realize they better solve the case fast...before they both end up dead.<br /><br />Move over Mary Higgins Clark, a new mystery/suspense author is on the rise! There are more twists and turns here then one would think possible for a single story. It takes one from the ritziest, most innocent of neighborhoods, to the dark, decadent underworld of the city, on a roller-coaster ride of spine-tingling suspense. Danger and depravity are the norm for Mici and Rob's suspects, drawing the two of them into its frightening web of deceit. Yet the two of them manage to get through it all with their innocence intact, while becoming closer to each other, adding a touch of romance to the tale.<br /><br />Ms. Michaels keeps the reader enthralled from the first page and one will be on the edge of the seat as the pages keep turning, all the way to the shocking and truly gothic style ending, which would do even Edgar Allen Poe proud.

Her parents were dead, murdered by Catheryn's guardian. She has been abused and forced to live in fear by Raymond de Brye. Her only hope was in a sachet given to her by the healer of the keep. Catheryn dreamed a dream that night, one of darkness and thunder and death. In this dream he came to her, atop a huge warhorse black as night. Was he her salvation... or her destruction?<br />Gerard, Count of Reveur, attacked Brezden with one intent - to kill the traitors to the king who brutally murdered Gerard's wife and newborn son. He finds Catheryn in her bed, battered and bruised by de Brye's most recent act of cruelty against her. But she was not too battered to stand up to Gerard and fight for her people and her home. He swears to protect her from further harm, though he does not trust this ward of his most bitter enemy.<br />Catheryn and Gerard are at odds from the beginning.  She has secrets she must keep to protest her men, and he wants nothing to do with a woman he believes could be in league with the devil in the flesh. Catheryn and Gerard are coerced into a marriage neither one wishes for, but their daily interactions cause feelings to grow and passions to flame... Catheryn finds herself falling in love with her Dream Knight, even though she fears him to be her downfall. Gerard is intrigued by his young unwanted bride, finding he longs to be her hero, and burning to reveal her secrets and heal her wounds, both the physical and emotional kind.<br />This was a page turning story. From the opening scene of Catheryn's dream, to the closing scene of the story, the reader is captivated. There is even a touch of the mystical, with dreams foretelling the future. There were however, a few unbelievable scenes, where suspension of reality is necessary to the acceptance of what happens. Also, a few of the supporting characters were not as fully developed as they could have been.<br />Catheryn and Gerard, and even de Brye, are fascinating characters, full of life. It was nice to see a hero who is not infallible, and often wrong. Many times he makes near impossible vows to others that he can't keep, making him feel horribly guilty he couldn't fulfill them. His goal in life is revenge, but fairer things intrude, stalling his plans. Gerard is far from perfect; in fact, he comes across as downright cruel in a few scenes with Catheryn, not understanding her actions. Ms. Lynn also handles a delicate subject with finesse, making it very realistic and subject to high emotion. Catheryn's behavior as a result of the abuse she receives is very natural, as are Gerard's reactions to it.<br />All in all, this book was a pleasurable read, though intense and deep at times. It will make one long to be swept away to a fantasy world, where dreams can tell the future and wishes come true.happens.

She was the Steward of Kellsjard, and quite possibly the only woman anywhere in the world to hold such a position. She is fiercely loyal to her liege, Lord Auglar. Suddenly however, her peaceful existence is shattered one day, when the wizard, Ax, comes to her with a mission that only she can carry out.<br /><br />Yozerf Trihychyl has been alone for most of his life, a half-breed who fits into neither a human world, nor a wolfkin one. He is tainted, an outcast, no matter which race he turns to; all they see is his mixed heritage, making him unworthy of their trust or respect. Then Ax comes to him, claiming the life debt owed him, for having saved Yozerf from death many years ago.<br /><br />Suchen's mission is to find and protect a young noblewoman, Trethya, and keep her safe from death by her enemies, with the help of the Sworn, warriors loyal only to Lord Auglar, Suchen, and each other. Trethya is the one person privy to a dreadful secret: her Council is holding Rozah, Queen of the entire kingdom of Jenel, prisoner. They want all of the power ruling the kingdom can bring. Their intent is to force Rozah into marriage with the sorcerer Jahcgroth, who will take her away to his own kingdom, and leave Jenel to the Council... or so they think. He has an agenda of his own that he is revealing to no one.<br /><br />Suchen and the Sworn set out on their journey, finding Trethya to lead her back to Kellsjard where she will be safe. Along the way, they meet up with Yozerf, their unlikely and reluctant ally promised by Ax. Yozerf's unique gifts as a wolfkin (shape changer) and an Aclyte will help them fend off the armies... and the dreaded Red Guard (also shape changers), sent by the Council to capture Trethya and bring her back into submission and to prevent her from revealing their evil plot. Treachery is everywhere, making Suchen's small army unsure of whom to trust, and seriously hindering their mission.<br /><br />Ms. Corvidae has written a stunning fantasy in this novel. Romance is definitely not the dominant theme, but it is woven in as a key part of the plot nonetheless. The characters are so vividly portrayed, one will see them everywhere around. They are realistic, forcing the reader to know them and empathize with them. They will also remain in memory long after the final page is turned.<br /><br />The plot is incredible and compelling; making the pages turn on their own accord. Secrets and surprises abound, always unexpected and never boring. The conclusion is shocking, leaving a few mysteries in its wake. This reviewer can only hope that is a hint of more adventure to follow in future books.

She had always dreamed of a life of money, flashy clothes, and grand parties. Then one night, her live-in boyfriend, Whit Richards, stabbed her to death. The last thing she remembers is a voice asking her if she wanted another chance at life. When Allie comes to, she finds herself in the body of wealthy socialite, Brianna Sinclair, holding the gun that just killed Brianna's fianc'!<br /><br />Pete Hackett is a private investigator who was close friends with Allie before her death. He doesn't believe for a second Whit's story that a burglar killed Allie, though there is no evidence to support Pete's suspicions. He knows Whit killed her and vows to prove it at any cost. When Brianna strolls into his office to find her late fianc''s real murderer, he is stunned to find he is attracted to her, a suspected killer. He agrees to take the case, counting on the money to finance his investigation to avenge Allie.<br /><br />Allie had always had a bit of a crush on Pete while she was herself, and now she has a second chance at him. She tells him her wild tale, and in spite of how bizarre it sounds, He finds that he believes her. They decide to work together to prove Brianna's innocence and find the real killer, as well as a way to prove Whit's guilt. But who does Pete really love - Brianna or Allie? And when justice is served, which woman will stay and which one will not survive?<br /><br />This was quite the interesting story. Ms. Wisdom sets quite a job for herself, to carry two separate stories in the book, and intertwine them into one tale of love conquering all. Allie is quite the charmer and Pete doesn't stand a chance against her. His dedication to her, even after he believes her dead, shows what a wonderful guy he is. The reaction of Brianna's family to her transformation when Allie takes over is pure shock as none of them ever expected such a change from the pushover Brianna had been.<br /><br />The conclusions to both story lines are more than satisfactory and the reader will feel that both Allie and Brianna are suitably avenged. However, the true killer of Brianna's fianc' is more then obvious, as is the motive behind it. This was an unusual story line and one isn't really even sure how to classify it. Reincarnation, ghost? Even so, it is fascinating and will keep the pages turning for the reader, all the way to the very end.d been.

She puts huge amounts of time and effort into designing the Christmas window to duplicate the exact portrait of a famous Christmas Ball from 1882. As she stands looking at the window, she imagines what it must have been like to be at that party. Suddenly, Cass finds herself at the ball, and face to face with Nicholas Wright, the portrait artist in the flesh. As Christmas draws nearer, so do Cass and Nicholas, in spite of the mental scars he faces from a time in his past. Now Cass is frightened... will she be whisked back to her own time or will she remain with Nicholas and the love they have found?<br /><br />This was a delightful Christmas tale, taking place in a Victorian era New York City. Ms. Daniel paints a vivid imagery of the city at the peak of the holiday season. One will feel as if actually at the balls and galas, wearing the glittering jewels and fabulous gowns. The passion between Nicholas and Cass is immediately obvious, as is Nicholas' angst over his present lifestyle.<br /><br />The Spirit of Things to Come by Vivian Knight-Jenkins<br />Taylor Kendall is a kindergarten teacher from Massachusetts, on her way to her parents' home, and dreading every minute of it. She sees a deer in the road ahead and swerves to miss it, sliding in the snow and going off the road, knocking her head on the steering wheel. When she comes to, she finds herself in 1692 Massachusetts, and in the heart of a puritanical town. She ends up in jail for openly and knowingly violating one of their laws she feels is stupid. Jared Branlyn, the local smithy, takes her in as his apprentice, keeping secret that she is a female. The more time he spends with her, the more attracted to each other they become. Taylor finds herself wishing she can stay with him, yet scared that her own time may call her back.<br /><br />This tale takes place in an often neglected period of American history. The restrictions placed on the every day lives of the Puritans makes one more appreciative of the rights found in today's society. This is a good story for making people remember just how special Christmas is.<br /><br />The Ghost of Christmas Past by Eugenia Riley<br />Jason Burke is a news reporter for a New York paper, who has lost his drive to write and has no desire to pen a series of \\"fluff\\" articles on Christmas traditions in England. He is touring the old Simmons hotel and is led on his tour by the hauntingly beautiful Annie Simmons. He cannot get her out of his mind and when he returns to visit the hotel, he ends up in 1852 where he meets Annie alive and well. He realizes his purpose there is to save her from a horrible fate destined to occur on Christmas Eve... and he does just that, falling in love in the process.<br /><br />This is an excellent story with a paranormal twist like this reviewer favors. The way Jason focuses so completely on his self-proclaimed mission to rescue Annie, backfires in a fascinating way, adding to the story. A true gem, Ms. Riley has written another wonderful tale.<br /><br />Twelfth Night by Flora Speer<br />Aline Bennett is mourning her beloved Grandfather's death, looking through his ancient Book of Hours, admiring a Christmas painting of Medieval times. She blinks and unexpectedly finds herself living the life depicted in the painting. She meets her soul mate at the same time and longs to stay with him forever. But will she be able to stay when fate calls her to return to her own time?<br /><br />This is yet another delightful story by one of the masters, Ms. Speer. Aline blends right into her new life, enriching the lives of all who come in contact with her. Her passion for life is real, as is her agony of wondering if she will be sent home with no warning. This is a great story to round out an even better collection.<br /><br />Who doesn't dream of life in another time and place at least once in their lifetime? Christmas is a time about taking one back to wonderful memories and treasuring loved ones. So what better way to showcase such a theme of time travel then at Christmas? Let this book warm the reader's heart, and encourage reminiscing over Christmases past.

She receives an unusual package that had been kept by her grandfather for many years, in trust for Dorel. It is a one of a kind samurai sword, ancient and beautiful, that just happens to carry the weight of a curse on all who possess it. She toys with the idea of selling it, convinced such a unique piece of work would be worth more than enough money to finance her; at least until she gets back on her feet. Just as she is about to transfer it in a sale, something indefinable halts her, making Dorel change her mind and keep it. Now... the next cycle in THE ETERNAL TRUST is to begin.<br /><br />Michael Gabrielli is a former military agent, with special psychic abilities honed in war, where he learned how to control and use them. He is also a collector of Eastern Asia artifacts and fine craftsmanship. When he finds out about Dorel's sword, he wants it. No... he NEEDS it, for he feels it rightfully belongs to him. When Dorel is nearly killed by a madman, also obsessed with the sword, Michael steps in, protecting her and making himself a fixture in her life.<br /><br />When Dorel and Michael meet, sparks fly from the beginning, and their entwined destinies come full circle. They are the latest reincarnations in a long line of people involved with the sword. Dorel is The Guardian, and Michael, The Defender, and neither can be apart from the sword nor each other without dire consequences.<br /><br />The sword has a special use; it gives immense power to the possessor, causing many to desire it. It also causes significant personality changes in Michael and Dorel, not for the better, as the ghosts of their past lives come to the forefront and take over their free will. In spite of this, or maybe because of it, their love for each other grows, and brings great danger as well, causing them to doubt everyone they know, not knowing whom to trust. If they do not break their bond to the sword's power, THE ETERNAL TRUST will claim their lives, as it did all their past incarnations.<br /><br />This was an intriguing story, though slow going in the very beginning.  It is a fascinating look at the possibility of past lives and how they affect the present. The lives of Dorel and Michael are often influenced by everything that has come before. The flash backs to their past lives adds an extra dimension to the story, and helps them to understand their current lives.<br /><br />Ms. Haynes has written well her story, and keeps the reader going, in spite of some rather confusing segments and an ending that is a little bit hard to believe. However, there are so many surprising twists and turns, one can't wait to find out what they mean to the tale... and Dorel's and Michael's lives.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, July 2002.

She has special abilities and traits she needs to keep secret, for no one from her small town in Georgia could ever understand. She has unusual webbed toes and hair which grows exceptionally fact, requiring cutting every day. In addition, she is an incredible swimmer, extremely fast, able to \\"sing\\" underwater similar to what dolphins do, to see her way, and she is able to breathe underwater for hours at a time.<br /><br />Alice never knew her parents, her mother dying when Alice was a baby and never knowing whom the father was. Her aunt raised her and hated her, considering Alice a freak of nature, as did the entire town. She had been good at keeping her special talents secret, until now, when two things happened. She had a vision of a man dying in a scuba diving accident and rescues him from across the ocean, with only her mind. The very same day, Alice rescued the Governor's granddaughter from drowning after hearing the child fall in the lake, from several miles away.<br /><br />Griffin Randolph is a professional treasure hunter. He is in Spain working a job, when one of his men gets trapped in the debris of a WWII ship, still holding live ammunition. He gets his friend free but is caught in an explosion as he is leaving the ship, almost dying. The only thing that kept him alive was a vision of a beautiful woman, known only as Alice, who tells him to breathe underwater.<br /><br />Lilith Bonavendier reads in the paper of the rescue of the young child, realizing Alice is her long lost half-sister, thought to have died at birth. Lilith and her other two sisters, Pearl and Mara go after Alice to bring her back to the family home at Sainte's Point Island, off the coast of Georgia. Now Alice finds out about her legacy, learning she is descended from one of the Old Ones, ancient Water People, commonly known as mermaids.<br /><br />Griffin, it turns out, is a distant cousin, also one of the Water People, who returns home to prove that the Bonavendier sisters killed his parents 25 years ago. Long buried secrets must now be revealed, if everyone is to be happy and Griffin and Alice are to be together.<br /><br />This was a delightful story and the beginning of what is sure to be a wonderful series by Ms. Smith. One feels Alice's pain at how she is treated by her aunt and the people of her town. All she cares about is being left alone after years of abuse from everyone. Her shock at finding her family she never knew existed is well portrayed, as is her adaptation to her new lifestyle. Lilith and her sisters are exotic and fascinating, loved by almost everyone who comes in contact with them. The history of the merpeople that is used by Ms. Smith is different from past stories used and is fascinating. One can almost believe they are real. And who says they aren't?<br /><br />There is one thing about the book that can be a problem, though. The switching back and forth between first person and third person storytelling is disconcerting and confusing. It is apparent, the reason behind that is to have the story told completely from Alice's point of view, but there are a few scenes that don't fit with what appears to by the idea of the author. There are a few scenes that should have been told in first person perspective but aren't, based on the way the rest of the book is written. That tended to knock this reviewer out of the story, making it difficult to get back into the correct stream for reading.who returns home to prove that the Bonavendier sisters killed his parents 25 years ago.

She indulged her love for it by becoming a maritime historian, the best in the field. Her greatest desire was to complete her father's life-long dream of finding the sunken ship, Isabella, a three-century old pirate ship, believed to hold the greatest treasure of its time. She finally gets her chance to go on a search expedition for the ship when the salvage operation her museum hired to find the ship goes off on its search in the wrong area. Kayla decides to join the expedition in hopes of leading them correctly to finding the lost ship.<br /><br />Captain Ben Mendoza is the owner of Xmarks Explorer, the operation hired by Kayla to find the Isabella. He is one of the best in his field, so is none too pleased when required to take Kayla along on his hunt. He is convinced his research is correct and the ship is right where he thinks and refuses to listen to Kayla when she tells him otherwise.

His is furious with Kayla for filling Madison's head with nonsense, believing it will only hurt her in the long run. And when Madison starts talking about the merman she saw in the sea, Ben is all the more convinced Kayla will do nothing but wreak havoc on his ship.<br /><br />But Kayla also has a hidden agenda in her desire to find the lost ship.

Every once in a great while, one of the merfolk is born unable to change. Tail or legs... they can only have one and cannot change back and forth between land and sea abilities. Twenty-five years ago, he and his sisters were sent away from home for their protection, when war ravaged the island.<br /><br />Beth Livingston hates the sea, getting dreadfully seasick every time she sets foot on a boat. Her father, Carl, loved the ocean and was always happiest when sailing its broad expanse for one of his adventures. Lately, his health had been failing and Beth would do anything to make him happy, even if she was less than thrilled with the idea.<br /><br />Saegar was finally returning home after his long exile in the seas. He couldn't leave the water, so he had spent many lonely years swimming the ocean. One day, he sees Beth on her father's boat, and mistakes her being ill for a plea for help in the old ways of his people. He comes to aid her... and gets captured for his trouble. Carl's crew, headed by the smarmy and sometimes cruel Ralph, captures Saegar and locks him in a tank in the hold. They plan to showcase him as the exotic being he is, and make lots of money in the process.<br /><br />When Beth first sees Saegar in his tank, she is stunned. Unbelievable! Here in the flesh (or should she say scales?) is her father's dream come to life. He always believed there were merfolk out there somewhere, but was made a mockery of for his beliefs. She is excited for her father but at the same time she feels sympathy for - and overwhelming attraction to - the creature. When she discovers he has very human characteristics, along with his tail, as well as feelings and a family, she feels terrible he is a virtual prisoner.<br /><br />Saegar asks her help in regaining his freedom but Beth is torn. Does she keep him there, as proof of her father's dream? Or does she help this being whom she is drawn more and more too, and her to her, as they have gotten to know each other?<br /><br />This is the delightful third installment in A Tale of the Sea miniseries. Ms. Paul has written such an entertaining story, full of laughs and angst. Saegar and Beth are perfect for each other, in spite of their biological differences. The humor in how Saegar comes to Beth's attention was well done, as is Beth's treatment of him when she believes he cannot understand a word she says. The rest of the supporting characters are wonderfully depicted as well, from Beth's eccentric father, to his rather mismatched crew.<br /><br />The story does tend to drag a little in the middle however. There really is not a whole lot one can do with being stuck on a ship and trapped in a tank for the bulk of the story. But the wit used to liven things up keeps the reader entertained. This story caused this reviewer to be Caught By Surprise with the way it was written and the exploits of the crew and their entanglements with a creature of myth. One certainly looks forward to the conclusion of the series in October with, For the Taking by Lillian Darcy.am?

He was one day away from tying the knot with fellow professor at Gannon University, Mary Kathryn O'Malley. He had dreams of them being perfect partners in everything, from marriage to research out on Lake Erie. So he is stunned when at the wedding, his bride-to-be ditches him just as she is about to say \\"I do.\\" He never saw it coming, and thought she was as happy about their partnership as he was.<br /><br />Desi Smith was the wedding coordinator for this bridal disaster. She feels for Seth, and tries to convince him to carry on with the reception anyhow, since everyone is there and everything is ready. Desi has had a crush on Seth since their high school days, so her heart goes out to him as he is humiliated in front of everyone. And when he gets totally drunk at the reception that wasn't, she takes it upon herself to make sure he gets home safely, not expecting to have anything to do with him after that.  Until she gets in a bind...<br /><br />When Desi's assistant gets a chance of a lifetime the day before her next job, she is stuck and can't think of anyone to help her out. Her parents won't help as they have never made a secret of the fact they thought she was wasting her God-given talents in her chosen career. So her only choice is to call Seth, and hope he will help her out. He agrees, not realizing what he is agreeing to, and he is horrified to find out what she needed him for, saying she owes him for that one.<br /><br />His return favor is that he asks her assistance to collect samples out on Lake Erie. She agrees and while out, she decides to get him to have some fun no matter what it takes. Seth is a stodgy professor, obsessed with his work and the logic of the scientific world. He swore to never let emotion get the better of him, having seen his parents, two overly emotional people who fight... and make up loudly and with abandon. Desi is a true romantic, who is all about having fun and enjoying life. As the two of them spend more time together, they grow more attracted to each other, finding it harder and harder to resist the magnetic pull between them. Seth has difficulties dealing with Desi's passion for life thinking there is no rhyme or reason to it. But the more he is with her, the more he realizes that maybe having zest for life - and each other - isn't such a bad idea after all.<br /><br />Ms. Jacobs has done it again! Her own love of life and finding the humor in it comes through in this story, and the lives of Seth and Desi. Her love of the town she calls home is also obvious, in that this story, as are all of her books, is set in Erie, PA. Seth and Desi's opposition in everything provides numerous moments of hilarity for the reader. Her attempts to make him see the finer things in life are sometimes met with disastrous results, but that doesn't stop her from trying. Seth's insistence that everything in the world has some sort of logical explanation drives her to distraction; all the while it endears him to her even more.<br /><br />Those readers who desire some lightness with their romance will find that How to Catch a Groom does not disappoint. Seth and Desi are made for each other, even though it takes him a while to figure that out. But the journey to that discovery makes it all the more wonderful when he does. Logic and emotion both have a place in life... and love. Ms. Jacobs' story proves that, and it is a delightful one. She is a wonderfully talented author who is making her mark in romance. Why not try a few others of her books as well? There is even one in the works, where the reader will find some favorite characters from this story come to life again.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

It is the week before her pending nuptials and she has been dreaming her own particular fantasy every night. Thinking it is just excitement of the wedding night and honeymoon to come, she decides to enjoy it and go with the flow. She decided to marry a fellow professor/research scientist from Gannon University, Seth Rutherford, expecting a happy partnership. But at her wedding rehearsal, all of her intentions fly out the Church windows when she sees.... Him!<br /><br />Tony Donetti is Seth's closest friend, and best man in the wedding. He just got engaged himself to long-time friend, Cara Romano. However, he is not entirely sure he made the right decision. He loves her, of that he is certain, but the sparks he always thought he'd find with the woman he'd marry are noticeably absent. Then he sees her....<br /><br />From the moment Tony arrives at the wedding rehearsal and literally bumps into Mary Kathryn, she begins to worry that maybe she is making a mistake. When her fantasy dream occurs again the night before her wedding, and the dream man is seen for the first time - with Tony's face - she knows the wedding is a mistake. As she is about to say \\"I do\\" and it comes out \\"I don't,\\" she bolts down the aisle and out of the Church. She hides out in a car in the parking lot until the owner arrives, and ends up falling asleep.<br /><br />As Tony is driving home to Houston from the almost-wedding, no one is more surprised then he when Mary Kathryn, Kate as he calls her, pops her head up out of the back of his car. Tony ends up taking the unwanted stowaway home with him, figuring that way he can keep an eye on her until she comes to her senses. But his noble sacrifice is put to the test when he finds himself desiring Kate for himself, with the feeling being mutual, rather then his fianc'e Cara. Now the test of wills between Tony and Kate begins: She wants to win him and he wants to resist. Who will the winner be?<br /><br />Ms. Tucker has a winner on her hands. This story is full of humor and hilarity. Kate and Tony are at odds from the minute they meet, but that doesn't stop the sparks from flying. Kate is completely logical and analytical, whereas Tony is more of an emotional, \\"take it as it comes\\" kind of guy. Some of the most amusing scenes occur in Tony's \\"Irish Pub and Sushi Bar\\" where Kate, with her medical background, tries to convince Tony...and all of his customers, that sushi is very unhealthy and actually dangerous to eat. One can't help but laugh at the comedy of their arguments, in hearing range of all the customers and employees. Also hilarious is the irony of Tony, a full-blooded Italian, who just happens to be allergic to tomatoes, much to the dismay of his mother.<br /><br />Tony tries to be noble through everything, putting Kate up in his home, finding her a job in his restaurant, and rotating her from job to job as she doesn't work out in each one. Kate is happy to be free and enjoys her life with Tony in Houston. Her attempts to convince him to live a little, instead of being engrossed in his career, at the same time she tries to prove to him she really does love him, provide some life to the tale as well.<br /><br />Ms. Tucker proves she has talent for finding the fun in everything and that comes across in the story, causing numerous laugh-out-loud moments for the reader. The Great Bridal Escape is this reviewer's first foray into Ms. Tucker's world and is delighted to say this won't be the last; she has become a \\"must-read.\\" Good news as well... it has been revealed that there is already another Duets in the works for Ms. Tucker and Ms. Jacobs, where some beloved characters from this story will return in stories of their own.

Between owning her own hair salon and taking care of Meg, she has no time for anything else, let alone getting involved in a relationship. Everyone she knows doesn't agree with her though, and keep trying to fix her up with every \\"nice young man\\" they know.<br /><br />Dr, Joshua Gardener grew up in Erie, PA, before heading off to go to med school. He decides to return home in the wake of his recent divorce to set up a small practice and start life anew. The last thing he wants to even think about is getting involved in a relationship with a new woman.<br /><br />Libby and Josh's first meeting was far from pleasant, starting over a parking space, so why can't either of them get the other out of their minds? Josh is annoyed by Libby's prickly attitude, but senses there may be something far different underneath. When the two of them are conned into co-chairing the town's annual Christmas party, they are thrown into close contact - too close for Libby's comfort. Sparks fly from the get-go though, and both find themselves looking forward to their \\"business\\" meetings.<br /><br />But Libby is nervous. Every other man she has tried being with, including her ex-husband, runs when they learn of Meg's disability. None have been able to handle the challenges unique to raising a disabled child. She is afraid Josh will do the same, so therefore she won't allow herself to get too close, knowing he will be gone from her life come Christmas. Josh isn't going anywhere though. He wins Meg's affection almost immediately, growing extremely attached to the delightful child, and in so doing he just may win Libby's heart as well.<br /><br />Ms. Jacobs shows her talent for weaving a charming tale, full of humor, and life in a good-sized city with a small-town heart. She handles a relatively sensitive subject (well it could be for some people) with ease, helping one understand the challenges associated the lifestyle, as well as the rewards. She depicts a family not hindered by it, but enlightened by it and overcoming it. Meg is such a charming child that no one could help but love.<br /><br />Libby and Josh's dance around their mutual attraction is very amusing, especially the multi page discussion about kissing. The reader will get a lot of laughs out of it. Libby's busybody neighbors and friends are a riot, reminiscent of characters from another series of books by the talented author. No matter what book of Ms. Jacobs a person reads, there are guaranteed to be unforgettable laugh out loud moments. One may get some funny looks depending on where the book is being read when people hear the laughs.<br /><br />Ms. Jacobs is an author to watch. Her unique style is one to love, which will take her far in the romance genre. This reviewer expects her to climb all the way to the top and become a household name in the near future.

Kevin has been having no luck finding them, until he saw Phoebe on television and recognized her necklace.<br /><br />Now Kevin is off to Kansas City, hoping to bring Phoebe to Loucan and getting at least one quarter of his mission accomplished. She isn't overly cooperative at first, not sure she can trust him, and hesitant to interrupt her practical routine. The possibility that she may have family brings back longings she thought were safely tucked away, and she can't resist that possibility.<br /><br />Just as Phoebe decides to go, their plans are shaken up when someone else comes after Phoebe, desiring her necklace and the legacy it protects... the legacy of a land found far beneath the waters of the ocean, and a people who can live in water and on land, the merfolk. Now Kevin and Phoebe are on the run, racing time to get her to Loucan and the secrets only he can answer about her family.

He returns to the keep in the Lowlands where he spent many of his young and carefree years. He is shrouded in mysteries surrounding the deaths of some of those closest to him. He has returned to claim his bride, Margaret Kincaid, to whom he has been betrothed since his childhood. But it is Margaret's younger sister, Sabrina, who catches his eye... and his heart. When Margaret suddenly disappears, he eagerly accepts Sabrina as a replacement bride.<br /><br />Sabrina grudgingly agrees to wed Ian, knowing she is bound to do as her father wishes. But she vows to never love Ian, swearing she has given her heart to another man. She has her doubts about Ian, having heard disturbing rumors about his past, and whisperings he may have had a hand in Margaret's presumed death. Despite her beliefs Ian betrayed her many years ago, she can't help but be drawn to him. Her spirited nature tells her to ignore all she has heard and to put her faith and trust in Ian.<br /><br />Ms. James weaves a passionate tale of love found, amid some of the most turbulent years of Medieval Scotland. For it is a time of great political upheaval as Robert the Bruce fights to gain his throne. Ian and Sabrina are caught in the middle of it all, on opposite sides of the political game, though their hearts are bound in the greatest battle of all... for A Promise Given and a binding love.<br /><br />Ms. James has created a lively cast of characters. The antics of Ian and Sabrina alone making for an exciting read. Both Ian and Sabrina are very strong yet imperfect people, with faults and fears aplenty for each, making them all appear all the more realistic. Add in the colorful cast of secondary characters and the story comes alive. All are memorable and only add, never detract, from the story. However, the secondary characters are not so well developed or dimensional as the hero and heroine. Many of the characters' behavior and emotions are never fully explained.

She is being groomed in preparation to marry Prince Ch&eacute; Vedla, son of another of the original ruling families. However, Tee'ah has but one desire...to experience the freedom of flying her own space ship. She has been taking flying lessons in secret, until her father catches her, forbidding her to continue. Vash princesses must spend their lives in isolation, doing nothing but supporting their family. Tee'ah has a flash of awareness, seeing her spirit withering away, so she decides to escape. She steals a space cruiser and escapes to the frontier world of Donavan's Blunder, disguising herself and adopting a new name, Tee.<br /><br />Ian Hamilton is the stepson of Rom B'Kah, ruler of the intergalactic Trade Federation. Rom married Ian's mother, Jasmine, seven years ago and has since chosen Ian as his heir to the throne. Many do not approve of this choice of Ian as the Crown Prince, feeling an Earth dweller incapable of ruling the galaxy. So Rom has sent Ian on a mission to prove his worth to the Federation. This mission carries him to Donavan's Blunder where he meets Tee and hires her as his pilot.<br /><br />While on his mission, problems arise for Ian and his crew. There is an activist group on Earth that is vehemently opposed to Earth joining the Federation. Ian discovers the leader of the Earth First Movement, Senator Randall, is on a mission of his own to prove that the Federation does not cared about its frontier worlds and that Earth is better off being independent. So Ian and Tee alter their journey to find Randall and convince him the Federation of the Galaxy is necessary to all of the worlds surviving. Meanwhile, Rom has dispatched his most trusted man to go out and find Tee'ah to bring her home.<br /><br />There are many obstacles in the path of true love however. Problems and breakdowns abound on Ian's ship, the Sun Devil, and for his crew. As Ian and Tee race against time across the galaxy, their respect and admiration for one another grow...as does their love. But each is afraid to reveal their true identity, convinced if they do, neither would realize their dreams: Ian proving his worth to Rom and the Federation, and Tee her freedom to be herself and fly. Their destiny lies in each other; will they realize it before it is too late?<br /><br />This is a gripping story, fast-paced and full of adventure. Ms. Grant pours her heart and soul, and her expertise in aviation, out onto every single page. Her characters take on a life and vitality all their own.

Dharkkum is the great living darkness which consumes all it comes in contact with, leaving nothing but desolation behind. She is supposed to combine her powers and abilities with those of the foretold Prince of Time. They will set out together on a dangerous journey to defeat their greatest enemy once and for all. Her mission is to rescue a magical book from the Lost Five, great and powerful warriors who became trapped in the last great battle. They sacrificed themselves to save the world, 10000 years ago in 12th century Wales.<br /><br />Morgan ab Kynan is a washed out drunken thief, who comes from a long ago age, thrust forward in time by an accident of fate. But was it really an accident? Or was it predestined? He arrives in a time and place unlike everything he knows, yet eerily familiar. He is permanently scarred, both mentally and physically, from his last battle with Dharkkum, in ancient Wales. During the battle he was thrust into the time weir, created by the great golden worms, guardians of time. He was cast forward in time, surviving terror and wounds he thought were the end of him. His only thoughts are to escape living nightmare only he can see.<br /><br />Now he must take his place alongside Avallyn, so they can meet their destiny.<br /><br />When first they meet, Avallyn is horrified at the man fate has chosen to defeat the evil Dharkkum. Yet she is inexplicably drawn to Morgan all the same. She must help him overcome his weaknesses and his fears so they can fulfill their destiny. They join forces in preparation for their journey to the distant past and put an end to the great darkness and nightmare. Their goals are tested by a cruel villain from Morgan's past, who is partially consumed and twisted by the very curse they are out to destroy. He will stop at nothing, and will even follow them through time, to get what he desires; an end to his living death and Avallyn.<br /><br />Morgan and Avallyn are joined by a motley group of friends, which include a young warrior boy, an ancient priestess, a powerful mage, some mysterious shapeshifters and fellow timeriders, and a few of the Fae folk. There is even a pair of legendary dragons, the only creatures who can destroy Dharkkum for all eternity. Join Morgan and Avallyn on their travels through time and their journey to an eternal love.<br /><br />Ms. McReynolds has spun a magical tale, a worthy conclusion to her trilogy. Once again, she does not disappoint. This is a beautiful tale of destiny and love intertwined, and its ability to conquer all, even time itself. She weaves a tale combining enchanting characters, who firmly entrench themselves in the reader's heart, with a fanciful plot and some shocking twists. This reviewer would have liked to see the actual journey through time play a bigger role in the story however. The story focused more on the attempt to make it to the time weir than the actual timeriding of the characters. Especially considering the name of the book. The journey through time almost seems just tacked on to the end.<br /><br />Past characters also make several appearances in this book, mainly through flashbacks. All in all, an entirely compelling read, the only big disappointment being that this is the end of the story.

All her life she has dreamed of a distant tropical island, convinced that is where she truly belongs. She and her employer were on a ship bound for India. Her employer was on a trip to find a husband; Anne was searching for her mysterious island. She hides her dreams and intelligence behind a façade of one who is extremely shy and not overly bright, longing for the day she can truly be herself.<br /><br />Horatio Merivale considers himself a failure. He failed his parents by refusing to settle down and marry a woman of his station in England. He failed at being a soldier by getting himself shot the very first time he goes off to battle, never even making it there. The only thing he is good at is flirting with all the pretty ladies, putting them at ease, and keeping his eternal optimism shining bright. When Horatio meets Anne on board the ship, he immediately senses she is not like the other ladies and that there is more to her than meets the eye.<br /><br />One evening on their journey, a severe storm comes up, causing the ship to flounder and eventually sink. Anne's employer abandons her to find her own way, after Anne helps her to get out safely. She thinks all is lost until Horatio happens upon her and rescues her. They escape the ship and finally get to a makeshift raft, holding a few of the others from the ship. While floating adrift, the castaways become very close, telling all of their hopes and dreams. Anne confides in them all telling them of her dreams of a distant tropical island.<br /><br />Conversation about her island is what keeps all of them going, even while floating aimlessly for many days, until they are rescued...by a pirate's ship! This one belongs to the infamous French privateer, Chartier, a scourge of the seas. He immediately imprisons Horatio, keeping Anne for his \\"queen,\\" having been told about her island, with a few minor exaggerations, and pressing the others into service upon his ship. Eventually, with a lot of help from Anne, they overturn Chartier, setting him adrift and taking over the ship.<br /><br />Now the real journey begins as they go on a quest to find this mysterious island of Anne's, convinced the \\"Hand of Destiny\\" will guide them. Horatio finds himself falling hopelessly in love with Anne, someone he never would have looked twice at were they still in England. But Anne resists his charm and allure, sure he will move on when he finds the next lady who catches his fancy. Now Horatio is on a quest of his own...to win Anne's love. How Ms. Cach resolves all of this is a real treat.<br /><br />This is another winner for the rising star Lisa Cach. Her popularity is ever on the rise and this book is an example of why. It is better than her last one, as they all are. The tension between Anne and Horatio is perfect and keeps the pages turning. Horatio is the perennial optimist (and romantic) which often grates on Anne's nerves, though she secretly likes that about him. Anne is bound and determined not to fall in love or get married until her dreams have been realized.<br /><br />The secondary characters are a delight, right down to Mango the monkey, who provides many comical moments to the story. Cartier is suitably awful and Anne's and Horatio's friends are a riot. Each one will endear themselves to the reader, who will be hoping for additional stories about some of them.

For hundreds of years, his family had been believed to be lost, murdered in the slaughter of their people over a thousand years ago.<br /><br />He reluctantly agrees to allow his sister, Desari to hire a human to travel with the band as their mechanic. But they must ensure the human never finds out their deepest secret. For they are of an ancient race of beings with superhuman strength and abilities... and who must feed on blood to survive. Darius is dangerously close to turning vampire, depraved and murderous, evil creatures that kill for the sheer pleasure of it. He is holding on only by his steely determination and desire to protect his family.<br /><br />Tempest \\"Rusti\\" Trine answers an ad in the newspaper, not quite sure why, except that it seemed to jump out at her with a compulsion she could not resist. She has always been different from others, having special abilities no one quite comprehends. When Tempest joins up with Darius and his family, she knows she has found some who are also a bit different, and she finally has a place she can belong. She doesn't mind that she never sees any of them during the day, or that they seem to have secrets they are keeping from her.<br /><br />The moment Darius first lays eyes on Tempest, his world explodes in colors and emotions he has not experienced in centuries. He immediately knows she is meant for him alone. He does not understand these sensations he is experiencing, or what they mean, having been isolated from his people since he fled from his home as a child, taking with him a few of the other children he was able to rescue. Darius is terrified to claim Tempest in the true ways of his people as the only converted human women he had met in his long life were insane vampiresses, murdering innocent children. He is unaware there a re a few human women out there who have special talents, making them capable of handling the conversion. Darius is compelled to be with her, and is willing to sacrifice all to keep her. Will he make the ultimate sacrifice?<br /><br />When Tempest meets Darius, one look into his eyes, and she is drawn to him like she has never been before. She can't understand it and that makes her afraid. She is used to being on her own, and has trouble accepting that she may actually need someone else now. She tries to escape this unusual thrall he has upon her, but she is not strong enough to fight it. Even upon discovering Darius and his family's dangerous secret, though she is repulsed by their needs, Tempest cannot resist the fire and passion in his magnetic gaze.<br /><br />Ms. Feehan has once again proven why she is one of the biggest stars of the genre. Every book is better than the one before. Tempest is by far the strongest heroine to date, in this reviewer's opinion. She is all modern and independent woman, who chafes at authority, and has quite a penchant for finding trouble. Darius is a very old fashioned man, from a long ago era, whose only desire is to protect and adore his woman, his lifemate. This makes for some very rousing clashes of will. The secondary characters are beautifully rendered, as in all the Dark books, and play just as big of a role in the story, as the hero and heroine, without ever overshadowing them. Many characters return from previous books and liven things up. And loyal readers will be happy to see a couple of their favorite continuing side stories have not been neglected. As always, the reader is enlightened a bit more about the world of the Carpathians.<br /><br />Though there is violence in the book, as is to be expected, this book does not seem quite as dark as the previous ones. Most of the violence in kept to a few chapters.<br /><br />There are only two faults this reviewer can find with Dark Fire. It is a little confusing how Ms Feehan bounces back and forth between Tempest's name and her nickname, Rusti. But once the reader gets used to it, it really does not cause any problems. The only other fault is that the book had to end! This is a beautiful addition to the ongoing Dark saga.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, 2001. All rights reserved.not cause any problems.

If the reader wants a rip-roaring roller coaster ride of emotion, this is the book for them. It is full of laugh out loud moments and good times. The reader can't help but fall in love with Nick and Maggie, cheering them on to a \\"happy-ever-after.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Kenner really gets in to the mind of a cat for this book.

The bedchamber Julia is using has not been used in twenty years. The reason for this is not entirely known but rumors abound of paranormal happenings in that room! Just what kind exactly Julia is about to find out...<br /><br />1437<br />Rae MacKinnon, the third laird of Dunraven castle, returns from a long imprisonment in England to rule his keep and his clan. The very last thing he expects is to repeatedly meet a woman in his bedchamber from over 400 years in the future!<br /><br />Julia and Rae are frequently thrown together through the amazing and rare phenomenon of an opening in the veil of time. This allows them a few stolen moments of happiness as their love grows. Will they conquer time and political intrigue to find peace and happiness together? The reader will be eager to find out.<br /><br />Ms. Kirkwood has woven a delightful tale of love and passion through time. She uses a very believable theory to explain the ability of her characters to travel through time. The reader can't help but fall in love with Rae and Julia. Both are very complex characters who have always had strength. They find even stronger passion and ability from their love for each other. Both are intense and multidimensional characters who step right off the pages of the book and into the reader's heart. The entire cast is enchanting, with its intriguing secondary characters and exciting villains.<br /><br />Ms. Kirkood's reasoning through which she spins a magical tale fascinated this reviewer, being of a scientific mind, balanced by a dose of romance. The reader can almost believe her premise of how and why a \\"Slip in Time\\" could very well happen.<br /><br />This is a well developed tale which keeps the reader enthralled from page one. Ms. Kirkwood throws in several twists to the story which should keep the reader guessing what is to come. However, the twists aren't quite shocking enough, for this reviewer, to keep certain parts of the story from being unsurprising. In spite of the predictability of some aspects of the plot, this is an intelligently written, entirely delightful story.

She has no desire to beg this horrid pirate to save them, but knows she has no other choice. She offers him his freedom in exchange for his help. But she cannot under any circumstances let him know her brother, Gabriel, is El Condor, for fear of what Marcus would do to her if he found out.<br />Marcus grudgingly agrees to help, if she frees the other prisoners onboard who are pirates, like him, and know how to sail a ship. Liandra has no choice so she does as he asks. Suddenly she becomes the captive, when she tries to prevent him from getting to the supplies he so desperately needs.

She is horrified when King Henry declares she must wed one of the three sons of the mercenary, Gavin Fitzgerald, who conquered them. Brianna swears she \\"will wed only my one true love.\\" So she sends the brothers on a quest. Whoever of the three that brings her a gift to make her laugh the longest is the one she will wed.<br /><br />Luc Fitzgavin, the eldest, refuses to go on her foolish quest, infuriating Brianna to no end. He has but one desire, to receive the seal on his beloved Welsh estate, from his brutish father. Luc was once a great knight, who swore to give up his sword forever, after living through a great tragedy brought about by another's dishonorable intentions. He scorns the selfish Brianna's whim, believing her full of nonsense. But as he gets to know her, he starts to realize there is more to her than he previously thought. And he begins to realize much more is at stake here...his very heart.<br /><br />Brianna and Luc are drawn to each other for reasons they can't understand. For Brianna is on a quest of her own: To return Tullymullagh to its rightful owner, her father. So he can live out his days in the home he built. Luc desires only to return to his beloved home in peace. Until suspicious events start to make them realize danger abounds. The two of them unite to try to solve the mysteries. Soon, it is evident someone wishes to harm them both. Rumors start to surface of a great treasure kept hidden, The Rose of Tullymullagh, and someone is determined to have the legendary piece for their very own.<br /><br />Ms. Delacroix tries to write a great adventure and mystery here, but falls short in this reviewer's opinion. Brianna comes across as a spoiled little girl who can't stand to not always get her way. She does somewhat redeem herself in the end, but not quite enough. She also comes across as not being the brightest crayon in the box. There are a few instances where the reader is in total disbelief that she cannot see the obvious. The mystery was not much of one as it was figured out almost immediately upon being presented.<br /><br />When the body count starts stacking up, the plot becomes contrived. It is almost as if Ms. Delacroix was running out of story and had to kill a few people to make her word count. But there are a few bright spots to the story. Luc comes across as a noble and honorable man, determined to do what is right and good, and to protect his lady at any cost. There are also some very funny scenes scattered throughout.<br /><br />This tale drags at many points and is not one of Ms. Delacroix's best. It was almost a chore to even finish the book. Having read several other of her books, one can only hope this book is just a fluke and the rest of the Bride Quest series is better.are a few instances where the reader is in total disbelief that she cannot see the obvious.

One especially dreadful night, she just snaps and realizes she has to get away immediately. She takes several valuables from her husband's home, figuring she can sell them, and heads for Cornwall, to a small cottage left to her by her uncle. She longs to escape her past, yet remain true to the promises she made to her mother, an opera singer whose talent<br />Konstanze inherited, before she died. Konstanze takes only her trusted servant Hilde on her journey to freedom.<br /><br />Tom Trewella was Konstanze's late uncle's solicitor, settling the man's estate. He is also the mastermind behind the smuggling ring operating out of Penperro, which is how many of the townspeople make enough money to survive. Upon meeting, Konstanze, he is immediately attracted but forbidden as she is already married and he has no idea why she left her husband.<br /><br />Robert Foweather is the chief Preventive officer for the crown, sent to Penperro to put a stop to the smuggling centered there that is costing the King thousands of pounds. As he is investigating a cove one day, he comes across Konstanze who was there sunbathing on a rock as she sang. Foweather is struck by the beauty of her song, and her appearance, and is convinced she is a mermaid.<br /><br />Tom seizes upon Foweather's mistake and convinces Konstanze to play along. A scheme is born. Konstanze will pose as the mermaid and make an appearance every time Foweather starts to get too close to finding the smuggling ring. She will serve as the distraction necessary to let the smugglers operate as usual. She disagrees at first but later gives in, relishing the chance to play at being something more exotic and exciting than she herself is. This forced constant contact between Konstanze and Tom causes sparks to fly and attraction to grow. But it is all bittersweet as she knows nothing can come of it<br />as she is still married. Will they be successful in their plot to distract Foweather? Will they give in to their newfound love and find a way to be together?<br /><br />This is an exciting story, full of humor and comedies of errors, as well as plenty of passion to satisfy every reader. This book is different from Ms. Cach's other books in that it is not even the slightest bit a paranormal. It is also far more inspiring of lustful thoughts than many of her previous works. This book borders on erotica in a few scenes and is definitely enjoyable to read.<br /><br />The characters are enchanting and will all attract plenty of attention. From the beautiful and talented Konstanze and the intelligent mastermind Tom, to the soulful vicar Matt and the formidable Hilde, and even the bumbling but comedic Foweather, there is bound to be a favorite for everyone. Ms. Cach never detracts from the primary storyline, even with all of the side line plots happening at the same time.<br /><br />Having read all but one of Ms. Cach's previous works, this reviewer has seen a marked improvement to the talents in each one, Mermaid of Penperro being the best to date. Ms. Cach is well on the rise to stardom in the genre, guaranteed to become a powerhouse of the romance market in the not to distant future. Each and every book is a delight, bound to be a keeper.

Across the hall Tom Quinlan runs a Private Investigation office. Tom and Elizabeth had a passionate relationship not too long ago until Elizabeth suddenly cut it off for no apparent reason. One hot day in midsummer, they get stranded, alone together, from a severe blackout, trapping them within the building. They cannot resist the fire between them, so they indulge it. But can their passion for each other overcome the secrets keeping them apart? Or is there a chance beyond this one night together, in the summer heat?<br /><br />Ms. Howard weaves yet another intense tale for which she is famous. This story is full of passion and sensuality. As always, her characters are skillfully rendered. The sparks between them fly off the page.<br /><br />The Leopard's Woman by Linda Lael Miller (originally published in 1992)<br /><br />Olivia Stillwell is in Mexico, researching details for her famous author uncle's next book. She is kidnapped and sold to Esteban Ramirez, and is confined to his ranch. Olivia is terrified of what she will be forced to do as his slave. However, from the moment she looks into his eyes, that fear slowly fades into an entirely different kind. She finds herself instead fearing losing her self, body and soul, in his embrace.<br /><br />Ms. Miller has written many a passionate tale, and this is just one more. She manages to pack a lot of punch, and plot, into this short novella. The characters are intriguing, though they could stand to have a little more dimension to them. In spite of that, this was another pleasing read by her.<br /><br />Lonesome Rider by Heather Graham Pozzessere (originally published in 1993)<br /><br />Blade McKenna has but one desire...to avenge the horrible murders of his wife and their unborn child, and his father. Jessica Dylan is on a quest of her own. She only wishes to head west to claim the land of her late husband's ranch. From the moment these two meet on their entwined paths, they are drawn to each other. When Jessica gambles herself as the prize, and loses to Blade, they find it impossible to resist each other.<br /><br />Ms. Pozzessere is an extremely talented author, a fact which is evident in this, one of her earlier works. The glimmer of her future stardom is found on every page. Her characters are beautifully created, and she delivers well on an often used plotline, making it her own.<br /><br />This book is a hot one, to be enjoyed in the peak of the summer heat. Or perhaps, it should be saved for warming up a cold winter's night. This is one to be enjoyed several times over.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, 2001.

He hides all his feelings behind a gruff facade, never letting on how he truly feels about anything. Zoe is convinced he is looking for an average woman to share his life. He can never love a woman like her, who disguises her superhero tendencies behind the mask of a sedate school librarian.

Green had been in no hurry to get married, content with her present way of life. She kept a man on the side to satisfy her sensual urges, so what did she need a mate for? Then she meets Jorlan again, as an adult and extremely desirable male. Suddenly she begins to rethink her past decisions.<br /><br />Jorlan Reynard swears to never marry. He is unhappy with the balance of power, where men are often nothing more than playthings for their mates. He refuses to give in to society's dictates. Secretly he has been in love with Green since he was but a boy, but he fears her finding out and using that to her advantage and to change his way of thinking.<br /><br />Then one day Green's greatest rival, Claudine D'Anbere sets her eye on Jorlan, deciding he will be her next mate, her past three having died under suspicious circumstances. When Green accidentally overhears the plans, she is forced to take drastic measures to protect Jorlan, fastening him to her life...and her bed. Jorlan is outwardly furious over the turn of events, but inside, he is delighted he will get to be with green. In spite of what he sees as manipulation and betrayal by Green, he can't help but enjoy her company, and the private pleasures of his fastening.<br /><br />Trouble does not end here though, for Green and Jorlan. Claudine is enraged at being outmaneuvered by her biggest rival, and swears her revenge. Now Green and Jorlan's fastening, and Ritual of Proof, are being questioned. They must join forces, something virtually unheard of in their society, to overcome the threats and bitter accusations. For they stand to lose everything they hold dear... including each other. Will their newly blossoming love overcome it all or will it be destroyed forever?<br /><br />This was a fascinating look at the Regency era, with a twist. It is a fast-paced book, keeping the reader in its thrall all the way to the surprising conclusion. Ms. Joy has created characters of amazing depth and strength. She also has quite an interesting idea in her concept of the Ritual Proof.<br /><br />However, some aspects of this book are highly confusing. Ms. Joy created a whole new vocabulary for this story, which is often redundant and distracting. There is a glossary in the back of the book, but it got tiring having to flip back to it for every other page. Some of the words she uses are never defined. This reviewer feels the vocabulary was unnecessary and normal every day words would have sufficed in most cases. A couple of the stories involving the secondary characters are never fully explained. One can only hope this was intentional, to be explained in a future book. But if one can get past the vocabulary and the few unexplained storylines, this is an enjoyable read.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

She was a doctor who gave up practicing medicine in the wake of a life-altering tragedy. She joined her sister's archeological expedition at the Shiloh Battlefield and found a ghost. Kenneth Campbell was a Confederate Officer, who had been killed at Shiloh. Amanda uncovers his grave, quite by accident, and finds the mini&eacute; ball responsible for taking his life. Suddenly, she finds herself thrust back in time, sent to rescue Ken and his daughter, Emily, from death. Amanda comes to realize she will sacrifice everything for the love of Ken.<br /><br />This is an intriguing tale by Ms. Davidson, using a slightly different method of time-travel in this story. The addition of a ghost or two adds dimension. Add a nasty villain and everything is here. The characters are lovable and the villain despicable. This is a pleasurable read and one can't help loving Amanda and Ken.<br /><br />Chances Are by Lisa Plumley<br /><br />Haley Madison is a genealogist researching the Chance family for a client. She is touring the old homestead of Matt Chance and picks up an antique perfume bottle. A wish and a prayer...and a dab of perfume later, Haley finds herself face to face with Matt Chance himself. She has been transported back in time to 1895. Finally, Haley has a chance to experience the love of a family that she has always longed for. Matt and his children, Rebecca and Jacob, are everything she has ever desired and she takes it upon herself to return happiness and laughter to Matt's family. Now Haley has to decide... should she stay with Matt's family or return to her own time?<br /><br />Another good story for this collection. Ms. Plumley uses just the right blend or seriousness, humor, and sensual attraction, between her characters. Haley is convinced no one can ever love her and Matt thinks everyone he loves will leave him. One will become endeared to Matt and Haley, and the children, from the moment they meet; and one will be cheering them on to a happy ending from the moment a more than slightly befuddled Haley meets an equally surprised Matt.<br /><br />Come the Spring by Cynthia Thomason<br /><br />Joanna Archer is an interior decorator. A spur of the moment decision leads her to a garage sale where she finds an antique photo album. Perusing the book, she comes across a picture of Clayton Hardesty and is immediately attracted to him. Another sudden decision has her flying from Ft. Lauderdale to Atlanta to return the album to the remaining members of the Hardesty family. While crossing a ravine to get to the old Hardesty homestead, she is hurtled 100 years into the past and comes face to face with the man himself! Now she has to make a choice whether to remain with this family she has grown to love or to return to her own time forever.<br /><br />Yet another interesting tale to round out this collection. Ms. Thomason's plot mechanism for traveling through time is unique, but it works. The chemistry between Clayton and Joanna is immediate and long term, in spite of Clayton's refusal to believe Joanna's story. Lila, Clayton's grandmother was a delightful addition. Definitely a good story to read.<br /><br />This collection was a fascinating one. An interesting common thread between the three stories is the fact that all three heroines lack a family and desire one. Amanda in Beyond the Call and Haley in Chances Are, are both orphans, though Amanda does have her sister. Joanna in Come the Spring is an only child of a single mother, who died many years ago.
