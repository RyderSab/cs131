In the publishing world, more and more authors are taking the self-publishing route.  Many authors choose this method of publishing because they've been rejected by mainstream publishers, want to control their writing projects from beginning to end, or even want to prove their worth to traditional publishers in hopes of signing a contract.  In M. LaVora Perry's new book \\"Successful Self-Publishing,\\" the Cleveland author of \\"Wu-lung & I-lung\\" sheds light on the dos and don'ts of publishing your own book.<br /><br />\\"Successful Self-Publishing\\" is loaded with helpful advice on many aspects of self-publishing, including information on the various forms of non-traditional publishing, finding a distributor, and how to market your book once it's printed.  The book also contains sample press releases, a list of reviewers from which to choose, and tons of information on how to publish a book from start to finish.<br /><br />What makes the book unique is how the author shares her own self-publishing and subsidy publishing experiences along with the helpful advice she gives to the reader causing the book to serve as part desk reference, part motivational guide.  It's obvious that the author truly cares about the readers' success, and she wants to use her experience as a children's book author to help them succeed.<br /><br />There are only a couple of minor problems with the book.  One is that it is rather short and contains only a portion of the information that other books on the same subject contain.  The other is the fact that the book gives information on the legal aspect of publishing but never advices the reader to seek a lawyer's advice.  Even with those minor flaws, anyone looking to gain the inside track on how to self-publish should still run out and pick up this no nonsense book.  Trust me when I say you will learn a lot about the publishing world, and the money spent will be paid back several times over.	2005-09-30

The sales team is responsible for seeking out opportunities from current customers and creating opportunities from potential customers.  In the new book \\"Selling is dead\\" by Marc Miller and Jason Sinkovitz, the Ohio-based authors explain the importance of hiring the right salesperson, recognizing the type of demand that is needed, and monitoring the progression of each sales stage.<br /><br />  \\"Selling is dead\\" introduces a new way of approaching potential customers based on four types of demand: new application demand, aggregate demand, continuous improvement demand, and economy demand because the authors believe that customer decision-making changes from one demand to another.  According to this book, an informed salesperson should be able to recognize the demand type and respond accordingly.<br /><br />  This book is at its brilliant best when it explains the Buyer Psychological Model, the importance of creating demand, and how to overcome traditional objections such as a potential client's budget constraints.  It also serves as a wake-up call for sales managers who employ mediocre salespeople who are ineffective at creating demand or selling to prospects who are satisfied with existing products or services.<br /><br />  However, there are a few problems with this book that may cause its words to fall on deaf ears.  The first is that it reads like a dissertation and contains complicated language (i.e. the cadence of commoditization) that may cause the average salesperson without a college degree to run for cover.  Next, the book is written from a very strategic point of view and lacks more needed tactical instructions.  Finally, the book is written with a slant towards IT firms and may turn off those who are not in technology fields.  In other words, it's great for IT sales managers but maybe not for other sales professionals.<br /><br />  \\"Selling is dead\\" has the potential to be a groundbreaking book.  The authors understand the psychology of supply and demand, the pressures of a sales manager, and the need to move salespeople from inertia.  But the success of this book will be determined by the buying public's willingness to make a major paradigm shift in the sales process and the hiring process and a clear understanding in the psychology of how purchasing decisions are made.  This book makes an interesting and informative read but it will be even more interesting to see if salespeople worldwide accept or reject it./> <br />     \\"Selling is dead\\" has the potential to be a groundbreaking book.

Would you wonder who you resemble in the family tree?  Could you deal with being ignorant to your family's medical history?  And most importantly, would you wonder where you belong?  In a new book from Craig Hickman, the author takes readers on his journey of discovering his true roots.<br /><br />In the new memoir \\"Fumbling Toward Divinity\\" from Harvard graduate Craig Hickman (Rituals), the author takes readers into his journey of the search for his biological parents.  Along the way, we learn of the African American writer's homosexual lifestyle that includes a marriage to his Caucasian partner.  The apprehensive author not only worries about finding his biological family but if they will accept his alternative lifestyle.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, readers are right there with Hickman as he researches his roots in libraries, government buildings, and online and treks along U.S. highways with help from his adoptive family, his husband Job, and his newly discovered Uncle James.  By the time he meets his religious, biological mother in Georgia, readers will come to know him and cheer him on as he takes on the task of finding and getting to know his real family.<br /><br />\\"Fumbling Toward Divinity\\" is a well-written and unique book.  Written in third-person format, Hickman meshes a poetic, scriptural-like, and a journal-like writing style that is quite interesting to read.  Many readers will feel a kinship with the author as he shares his trials, triumphs, pain, and joy of self-discovery.  However, the meticulously written memoir, which almost reads like a diary, is so detailed that it may turn off readers who do not know him intimately.  \\"Fumbling Toward Divinity\\" is still well worth the effort and will be received with open arms.<br /><br />Emanuel Carpenter<br />[...]	2005-05-02

Everett Prewitt's debut novel \\"Snake Walkers,\\" an educated yet but naïve African-American reporter, Anthony Andrews, accepts a job in the early sixties as the first black employee of the Arkansas Sun, a newspaper known to have been unkind to his race throughout its history.  Excited to get out of the family's mortuary business, Andrews takes an assignment to investigate the disappearance of the citizens of a rural Arkansas town. His investigation leads him to strange characters, different little towns in Arkansas, and eventually to Cleveland, Ohio.<br /><br />In Cleveland, Andrews befriends the odd but close-knit Williams family to learn more about their roles in the disappearance.  When he begins to build a bond with the black family, especially the college-bound Raymond, he becomes conflicted.  If the family is guilty of a crime, was it justified?  If so, should he reveal his discoveries to his historically racist superiors for a story that could catapult his journalism career?  Having witnessed a horrific crime as a boy complicates matters even further.  These are the type of ethical dilemmas the reporter must deal with as the story unfolds.<br /><br />Andrews enlists the help of Carla, an intelligent and beautiful college professor with a background in history.  While there appears to be a spark between them, their ideologies cause them to clash.  If there is any chance of romance between the two, one of them will have to do an about face in regards to his or her beliefs about civil rights, racial atrocities, and the justification of revenge.<br /><br />\\"Snake Walkers\\" is a captivating book that delves into explosive subjects such as lynchings, overt and institutional racism, and retribution.  Although this is the author's debut, Prewitt clearly writes from wisdom and know-how, which will cause readers to sacrifice a few hours of sleep to read a few more chapters before bedtime.<br /><br />While this book is a recommended read because of its hang-on-the-edge-of-your-seat content and original storyline, there are a few imperfections.  Though the author knows his way around a metaphor, he is still guilty of telling rather than showing.  Also, it's difficult not to compare the novel to better written work of the same subject matter, of recent \\"Blood on the Leaves\\" by Jeff Stetson and of old \\"A Party Down at the Square,\\" a short story that appears in \\"Flying Home\\" by Ralph Ellison.

The book is a comprehensive guide to almost everything that marketing encompasses.  For example, the authors give expert advice and a dose of reality in regards to creating a marketing plan with the following:<br /><br />\\"`Build it and they will come' is not an effective marketing plan or strategy.  A successful plan boils down to two essentials:<br /><br />1. Knowing the market inside and out, including what customers want and expect.<br /><br />2. Knowing the way to satisfy customers by knowing competitors, barriers to entry, costs, outside influences, budgets, knowledge, etc.\\"<br /><br />Though the book is filled with useful information, it does have a few problems.  For one thing, the writing is sort of plain and reads more like a college textbook than a \\"guerilla\\" marketing guide.  Secondly, it leaves out a lot of some of the latest trends in marketing such as when to use pop-up ads, weblogs, and viral marketing.  And finally, lots of the material seems to be outdated and at least five years late.<br /><br />This book would make an ideal book for a college student in Marketing 101.  It gives a thorough strategic and tactical marketing foundation for anyone looking to explore the topic.

The sales training guru and author of several sales-related books, including the excellently written \\"Getting the Second Appointment\\" leads the way once again into the office of Very Important Top Officers (VITO).  In his latest book, \\"Getting to Vito,\\" Parinello elaborates even more on why it is important to reach and sell to VITO.<br /><br />In this new book, the author stresses the importance of pre-planned calling, prioritization, correspondence, and many other topics that are designed to get salespeople talking with and selling to executive level officers.  Not only does the book serve as a must-have reference guide but also as a motivator to all salespeople who go through the rigmarole of sweet talking gatekeepers, leaving tons of voicemail messages, and making sales presentations, and getting no results.<br /><br />The chapter on how to leave voicemails (The Art of the Voice Mail Message) is a humorous and inspiring treat.  Though the method he suggests requires energy, tenacity, and above all, courage, readers should expect to notice a higher number of returned calls in no time after using this technique.<br /><br />Though the book contains lots of material from some of Parinello's earlier work, it should still be a useful tool for anyone who reads it and wants to sell to executives, especially those who have never read his previous books.

Writers face a number of obstacles, including dealing with rejection letters, going through writer's block, and let's not forget, finding time to write.  In \\"Pen of Fire,\\" author and University of California creative writing teacher Barbara DeMarco-Barrett serves as a catalyst in helping writers achieve their goals through discipline and planning.<br /><br />Although the book is geared towards women writers with busy lives, there's clearly enough useful information for everyone who is serious about the craft.  Barrett draws on her own experiences (as well as the experiences of other professional writers who've experienced trials and triumphs) when discussing a wide range of topics, including how to make time for writing on a daily basis, structuring plot and creating interesting character, and what to look for when searching for a literary agent or a publisher just to name a few.  What makes the book unique is that every chapter is succeeded with Barrett's \\"Set the Timer\\" instructions, allowing the reader to take a more active approach while reading the book.  The result is an incredibly motivating and informative book on the craft from a writer with experience, intelligence, and industry know-how.<br /><br />Though there are so many quotable passages that could be remembered for a lifetime, one of the best is when the author says \\"My own experience tells me that to succeed with your writing, you need a combination of patience, instinct, awareness, and timing.  But mostly you need a belief in yourself and your project, and the willingness to do what it takes to work as long and hard as you must to get out there.\\"<br /><br />\\"Pen on Fire\\" is just what the marketplace needed, a thoroughly researched, highly motivational, and instructional book that will cater to all writers who love to write.

How you would feel if you were told you could write a 50,000 word novel in 30 days?  Would you picture yourself quitting your day job and retreating to some log cabin to write it?  Could you see your name on the New York Times Bestseller list?  Well, in Chris Baty's new book \\"No Plot? No Problem!,\\" the author explains just how the seemingly impossible goal is attainable.<br /><br />Baty is the founder of the National Novel Writing Month challenge (NaNoWriMo), where everyone from the polished author to the newbie is given the task of writing a novel in 30 days.  The book serves as a step-by-step guide on how to achieve the goal.  Why is the writer only given 30 days?  It's because people seem to work better when deadlines are established.  Baty explains: \\"...most of us become \\"one day\\" novelists.  As in, `One day, I'd really like to write a novel.'  The problem is that that day never seems to come, and so we're stuck.  Or we were stuck, anyway.  Because as far as artistic deadlines go, this book comes with a doozy.\\"<br /><br />What about the person who hasn't a clue about novel writing?  Not a problem.  Baty shows you how to get started by developing characters, writing what you know or want to know, and participating in free range writing without worrying about editing.  By the time you're done, you'll have a first draft of that great American novel you've been promising yourself you'd write.  Well, uh, at least you'll have written an American novel, which is the goal here anyway.  The editing phase and getting published are a whole different ball game.  So if you're just writing a novel just to say you've written one or to get a major publishing deal like a few of the NaNoWriMo participants have done, there's something in this book for you.<br /><br />\\"No Plot? No Problem!\\" is filled with sound advice on how to write the first draft of a novel, even if you don't adhere to the 30-day rule.  Baty's humorous writing style makes reading the book a fun way to learn all about the writing process without necessarily taking the task too seriously.

When Klarke Taylor's husband leaves her for another woman, her world catapults into one filled with turmoil, bills, and loneliness.  But when Klarke discovers the personal e-mail address of a best-selling author named Reo Laroque, she figures life is giving her a second chance at lust, riches, and maybe even love.  Although Reo enjoys the company of groupies who admire his work and his money, he longs for a woman he can bring home to his parents.  The pair begin a series of steamy e-mail exchanges that leaves them both longing for the real thing.  Klarke convinces the writer that they've met in an airport, when in actuality, they have never met.  Of course, that will have to change.  This premise sets the stage for Joylynn Jossel's latest novel, \\"The Root of All Evil.\\"<br /><br />When Klarke's best friends Jeva and Breezy are introduced, we learn that they are having relationship problems of their own.  Jeva longs for marriage with her long time live-in boyfriend, even though he is not ready to make that permanent commitment.  She also struggles with the circumstances of her adoption, since she never knew her biological parents.  Breezy, on the other hand, balances two men, one of them poor but a dynamic lover, the other one married, abusive, and paid.  When the latter decides to break things off, she offers revenge a la Fatal Attraction.<br /><br />\\"The Root of All Evil\\" is an interesting read, full of twists, turns, and a very unpredictable ending.  Jossel even infuses some clever humor in the story, like when she writes the following:<br /><br />\\"You didn't!\\" Jeva whispered.<br />\\"I knewed it!\\" Breezy exclaimed.  \\"You gave him some Boyz N the Hood pity sex?\\"<br />\\"Evan lucked up on some life-crisis drama sex like Cuba.\\"  Jeva laughed.<br /><br />Although I would recommend this book to those who are interested in a combination of street lit and chick lit, I did have a few problems with the book.  While the Columbus, Ohio native and Capital University graduate knows how to craft a good plot, she seems to cross the thin line between sexy and vulgar, which may turn some readers off.  Another problem I had with this book is the authenticity of the dialogue, especially when slang is mixed with proper English, all in one sentence.  This combination makes for an awkward read.  Yet even with these minor problems, I would still give this books a thumbs up because both the main characters and the peripheral ones are just like everyday people who deal with real-life situations, the plot is fast-paced and interesting, and the story is quite original.  \\"The Root of All Evil\\" makes an entertaining read that many people will be able to relate.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Emanuel Carpenter<br />[...]cross the thin line between sexy and vulgar, which may turn some readers off.

Unfortunately, over five thousand of these horrific murders plague the world by victimizing women throughout the world.  \\"Burned Alive\\" is just one of many tales of these atrocities.<br /><br />In this book, author Souad tells the tale of what is was like growing up an unwanted female in a violent, patriarchal society.  In her village, men are treated like kings while women are treated like garbage.  The birth of a female child is cause for grief, not celebration.  In her small village, her brother and only male in the family is treated like royalty while she and her sisters are exposed to treatment worse than slavery.  The author describes her own father as an evil and abusive man.  When the author recalls a time when she accidentally let the sheep escape, she writes the following about her father:<br /><br />\\"He pulls me by the hair and he drags me on the ground into the kitchen.  He strikes me while I kneel, he pulls on my braid as if he wants to pull it out, and he cuts it off with the big scissors used for shearing wool.  I have hardly any hair left.  I can cry, yell, or please but I'll get more kicks.\\"<br /><br />When the author does the unthinkable and shames the family by getting pregnant before marriage, her brother-in-law is given the duty of killing her.  She describes in great detail how she had been doused with gasoline, lit on fire, and left to die.  Her escape from her family, her village, and ultimately her country is a source of motivation.<br /><br />\\"Burned Alive\\" is not the best book written on the subject of honor-killings or on atrocities committed against women.  While the topic is important for readers to become aware of, the writing is the book is rather lackluster for such a powerful subject.  However, for readers who are not aware of how thousands of the female population is murdered simply for being female, the book will serve as an interesting introduction to this shameful yet important issue.<br /><br />Emanuel Carpenter<br />[...]ful yet important issue.

After the mysterious death of a young woman in her supposedly haunted house, a young newspaper reporter named Jack is assigned to investigate the tragedy.  The skeptic Jack enlists his friend Phil, a scientific expert with all kinds of gadgets and equipment for these types of occasions, to help.  Not only does Phil want the opportunity to investigate the ghosts and spirits of the house, but he also wants access to a rare and priceless book.  Phil assembles of a team to help with the investigation, a team that includes psychic expert Kurt Schroeder and an odd and obnoxious pair of janitors named Spidey and Smokey.  This sets the stage for \\"Parasites\\" a new suspense/humor book from Ohio writer H.B. Marcus (Crispy & The Joe Schmoe Show).<br /><br />As the story unfolds, Jack and Phil use their investigative skills and wits to uncover the mysterious death of Barbara Pinchot.  When the pair first visit the spooky home, they are faced with all kinds of things that go bump in the night.  Further visits with the Phil's team reveal even more strange happenings, such as doors that shut by themselves, equipment that does the same, and ghosts that don't necessarily respond to angry taunts and machine gun blasts but lose it when the word \\"dude\\" is spoken.  The strange and hilarious duo of Spidey and Smokey provide the shots, shouts, and \\"dude\\" utterances.  The team try to find the truth before it kills them.<br /><br />Though the book could stand alone as a mystery/suspense novel, it is the humor that makes it worthwhile.  While Spidey and Smokey serve as the comic relief in the book, it is at its hilarious best when Marcus provides Jack's first-person narration.  Upon the first visit to the mansion, the author writes after hearing a strange voice ask for help:<br /><br />\\"Help me open the door!\\" he grunted.  \\"What the hell is taking you?\\"<br /><br />I could almost hear Richard Dawson yell, \\"Survey says...paralyzing fear!\\"<br /><br />H.B. Marcus writes in a fun and imaginative style you'd expect to find in a Farrelly Brothers script.  The style is also reminiscent of the classic writings from 60's sitcoms like The Dick Van Dyke Show and I Love Lucy.  Though the length of the book may be a little shorter than a novel intended for an adult market, Parasites is still intriguing and laugh out loud funny.

One of the hottest trends in African-American literature has been street lit or literature involving life on the streets.  Oftentimes, this life includes hip-hop themes, the drug culture, and even prostitution.  In \\"Chasin' It,\\" a new novel by novelist Tony Lindsay (One Dead Preacher), the author takes the idea of street lit to the extreme.<br /><br />The novel is based on the wild and dangerous life of Terri Parish, a gay drag queen who has been in and out of jail.  When Parish is released from prison after a seven year bid for fraud, he is faced with life on the streets once again.  Terri gets caught up in prostitution which includes selling his body for drugs.  When Terri gets involved with a former inmate, Mo-red, who mistreated him in prison, Terri decides to get even by stealing his drugs and money, and leaving him for dead.  When Mo-red shows up, battered but alive, Terri must decide if he will run for cover or stand up and fight.<br /><br />The story is told primarily in flashbacks.  These flashbacks include Terri's first sexual experience with the boy next door, his growing up under his grandmother's guidance, and his troubles in prison where he was forced to prostitute himself.  When the story returns to the present, we find a crack-addicted Terri, longing for love yet chasing money, drugs, and sex.  While Terri dreams of moving to Birmingham to escape the mean streets of Chicago, there always seems to be something pulling him back.<br /><br />Lindsay's style of writing makes the story feel authentic and even funny at times.  It is very interesting the way the author mixes pronouns, sometimes referring to the protagonist as she, other times as he.  When Terri is on his way to prison once again, the author humorously writes:<br /><br />\\"All Terri heard the judge saying was fifteen to life.  He said it as easily as if he were ordering a drink: scotch, no ice; fifteen to life; scotch, no ice; fifteen to life...scotch, no ice; fifteen to life.<br /><br />Terri's stomach was twisted as tight as one of Madear's dishrags.  He found it difficult to breathe.  He could no longer distinguish between what he imagined the judge was saying and what the judge actually said.<br /><br />Bring the prisoner here or Get all the picaninnies out of here.<br /><br />We're getting behind or Kill all their kind....\\"<br /><br />\\"Chasin' It\\" is a one-of-kind story that is hard to put down.  The idea of commingling the street culture with the gay lifestyle is a risky yet successful endeavor.  When the material gets sexually explicit, it's almost like being a fly on the wall.  Though the material may make a few people uncomfortable, those readers who enjoy stories of brothers on the down low, life in and out of prison, and stories from writers like E. Lynn Harris will no doubt enjoy this fast-paced, no holds barred story.  Lindsay has not only crafted an intriguing tale but may have also added a new genre to the field.

If you said bad ideas, you're only half right.  According to the new book \\"The Origin of Brands\\" from marketing experts Al & Laura Ries (The Fall of Advertising & The Rise of PR), they are also examples of convergence, which should be avoided whenever possible.<br /><br />Convergence occurs when products produced separately are merged into one.  The authors of this book offer an alternative, divergence or new products or services that stand alone.  Relying heavily on examples from Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" the authors explain why creating separate categories are more beneficial to consumers, businesses, and the marketplace.  The authors state \\"Did you ever see a tree in which two branches converged to form a single branch?  Perhaps, but this is highly unlikely in nature.  It's also highly unlikely in products and services.\\"  Instead, according to this book, divergence is the answer.<br /><br />In the chapter titled \\"Survival of The Firstest,\\" the authors give the best advice.  They insist on the importance of launching a brand into a naught market, relying on the importance of being first.  And if you can't be first in the market, the chapter \\"Survival of the Secondest,\\" explains how to survive being second and how to overcome the competition.  The authors explain how emulation is to be avoided and being the direct opposite of competitor's works best.  They use The University of Phoenix, G.I. Joe, and Bud Light as successful examples.<br /><br />Though this book tends to overlook some of the successes in convergence, like the car stereo and the caller ID/phone, \\"The Origin of Brands\\" is still an excellent book.  It's packed with intelligent marketing and public relations advice that could be applied to practically every product, business, or service.  Anyone in business will love this book and will not be able to put it down until the very last page.  \\"The Origin of Brands\\" will make a wonderful desk reference for anyone who wants to practice sound marketing techniques.

Lisa, a twenty-something American woman of mixed-heritage seems to have disappeared after a trip to Japan.  As the plot unfolds in \\"Country of Origin,\\" we learn that Lisa is a Ph.D. candidate looking to write about Japan's matriarchal society.  Her research (and need for money) leads her down the dark path of the country's underground sex world in the early eighties, where men pay wads of cash for female companionship.  Is it the reason for her disappearance?  That's what Kenza Ota would like to know.<br /><br />Ota, a bumbling detective, is given the task of finding the whereabouts of Countryman.  But his lack of skill either leads him to dead ends or two steps behind.  Though Ota suffers from the humiliation of being a terrible detective, he takes the Countryman case very seriously since it could redeem him.  Meanwhile, Ota deals with the crisis in his personal life, including a divorce that occurred fourteen years ago that left him single and celibate.  When his ex shows up in Japan with her teenage son, he is convinced that he is the boy's father.  He follows the boy while working up the nerve to speak to him.<br /><br />Then there's Tom Hurley.  Tom, an embassy service officer, gets involved in the case when Lisa's sister contacts him from America.  When Tom begins an affair with Julia Tinsley, the wife of a CIA agent, Lisa Countryman's case becomes the highlight of their conversations.  Once he learns this, he digs deeper into the case, not because he truly cares but because he wants to keep Julia interested.<br /><br />This book is not only about the mysterious vanishing of Lisa Countryman, it is also about race, gender, sex, and Japanese culture.  The underlying theme of the Japanese's obsession with racial homogeneity is eye-opening and mind-boggling.  The underground sex world is described in titillating detail.  Author Don Lee, who also wrote \\"Yellow,\\"  is a gifted writer who is best when taking a subject and rolling with it like in this passage:<br /><br />\\"Kenzo had always been rail-thin, as was Yumiko, but Simon was fat.

Though Nate truly loves her, their matrimony seems more like a conquest than a foundation for longevity.  As the marriage progresses, the couple's idiosyncrasies are revealed to one another.  Nate is the jealous type who tends to drink too much.  Maggie is a bit on the naïve side. Her epileptic seizures cause her grief and memory lapses.<br /><br />After Maggie begins to fall for Phil Carson, a reporter from her workplace, things get complicated.  One fateful morning, Maggie awakens to a lump on her head and blood on the floor.  Her husband is accused of the assault.  An arrest and conviction leads to jail time for Nate.  But Maggie's memory lapse and personal motivation causes others to doubt her story.  To make matters worse, another man confesses to the very crime Nathan is accused.  Maggie must decide what to trust, the words of the community around her or her own foggy memory.<br /><br />Jaskunas dances back in forth in time, from past to present with the delicacy of a trapeze artist.

The roadblocks that show themselves in the form of gatekeepers, decision-makers, self-sabotage, and more are plentiful. In Anthony Parinello's new book \\"Getting the Second Appointment,\\" he sheds light on how to negotiate the sometimes vicious sales cycle from the initial cold call to the request for business.<br /><br />In this book, Parinello (Selling to VITO) takes on the tremendous task of teaching salespeople how to sell in a relatively short amount of time, specifically after two phone calls. He schools salespeople on how to approach each key player in the sales hierarchy, including approvers, recommenders, influencers, and decision makers. The author infuses Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and applies it to the personality types of the top officers of any organization. Parinello even gives great advice on how to approach gatekeepers and use them as allies.<br /><br />\\"Getting the Second Appointment\\" is part motivational book and part step-by-step instructional manual. Parinello uses practical examples that are especially useful for those people who are in phone sales. The book also offers online collateral for continued education after reading the book.

What's more, they're dying in the same fashion as their alleged victims of long ago.  When it is discovered that Professor Martin Matheson has composed a list of the men for a college course he teaches, he becomes the prime suspect in the murder investigations.  Matheson, an intelligent yet pompous man believes the men got just what they deserved.  But did he participate in their untimely deaths?  That's what James Reynolds, the only black prosecutor in the district attorney's office, would like to know.<br /><br />When Matheson is arrested for one of the murders, he hires long time civil rights advocate, Todd Miller as his attorney.  Miller, a middle-aged man who sports a pony tail and is a friend of the prosecutor, comes from a long line of attorneys.  And by the way, Miller just happens to be Caucasian.  Though Miller is not thoroughly convinced of his clients' case, he cannot refuse what will prove to be the case of a lifetime.<br /><br />Thus sets the stage for the trial of the century, even bigger than O.J.  When Reynolds's haunting secret of the past reveals itself again, he becomes even more dedicated in proving Matheson's guilt.  But battle with a genius professor, a seasoned attorney, and a history of bigotry may prove to be enough to send the prosecutor over the edge.  Can he win the case? And if he does, will justice be served?  Regardless of the outcome, the clear winner will be the reader.<br /><br />Jeff Stetson, writer of the long-running play The Meeting, has crafted a powder keg of a tale full of intrigue and shock that will leave readers longing for more well after its dynamic conclusion.

Edmund offer the ex-reverend a ride from Virginia to his sister's house in Montana and a piece of an insurance hustle.  All King has to do is insure a few pieces stolen jewelry and file a claim when a robbery is staged.  When Joel agrees to go along with the scam, the plot for \\"Plain Heathen Mischief\\" is set in motion.<br /><br />Upon his release from prison, King discovers that he is being sued for divorce and alimony by his wife.  He is also being sued by Christy, the bratty, alcoholic teenager he was convicted of molesting.  To help him with his legal woes, Edmund introduces Joel to his partner in crime, Sa'ad X. Sa'ad, a smarmy attorney whose personality is more like Don King than Johnny Cochran.  Sa'ad gives Joel legal advice on how to fight the divorce and the civil lawsuit worth millions of dollars.<br /><br />When the somewhat naïve reverend discovers that he may have been set up by his new friends, he soon devices a scheme of his own to keep himself out of trouble and to get himself a bigger piece of the pie.  Meanwhile, after discovering how difficult it is for a felon to find employment, he tries to establish some normalcy in his life by working two jobs while helping his sister take care of her young son.  To make matters worse, his probation officer is threatening to send him back to jail if he doesn't pay him a bribe.<br /><br />Though \\"Plain Heathen Mischief\\" is full of twist and turns involving lowlife criminals, a conniving teenager, and FBI agents, the plot is somewhat unbelievable, especially when the protagonist shares a secret with his sister Sophie that may have kept him out of the whole chaotic mess in the first place.

Though there have been a few success stories regarding women on the scene and behind the scenes of the Hip-Hop movement, women's place in it have been, for the most part, invisible, degrading, and kept to a minimum.  In Gwendolyn's Pough's exciting new book, Check It While I Wreck It, the assistant professor of women's studies at the University of Minnesota examines the dysfunctional relationship between Black women, feminism, and Hip Hop.<br /><br />The book commences with a history of Black women in the public sphere who have contributed to the betterment of African-Americans such as Angela Davis, the historical Black clubwomen, and women who were trailblazers in the blues music industry.  Pough reveals how Black women laid the foundation for future successes for the entire race.  Pough writes \\"Black women were major players through Reconstruction, the civil rights movement, and the Black Power movement.\\"  In fact, because of their exclusion, the author even suggests a re-writing of history.<br /><br />Later the author gives us a more recent history of women's contributions to the arts and Hop, including Sylvia Robinson, the label owner of Sugar Hill Records, break dancer Baby Love, and female rapper Roxanne Shante.  The book gives major props to Grammy-winner Queen Latifah, Sista Soulja, MC Lyte, and poet Jessica Care Moore.<br /><br />Pough also critiques the products of popular culture such as movies like Boyz N The Hood and Just Another Girl on the IRT, books such as Sista Soulja's The Coldest Winter Ever and Omar Tyree's Flyy Girl, and of course rap records such as L.L. Cool J's I Need Love, and Latifah's U.N.I.T.Y.<br /><br />The book is best when examining the problems that exist between women and Hip-Hop, from the objectification of women in music videos to the acts of hyper-sexual rappers such as Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown.  Pough writes \\"Today, in addition to the old images of the sexually promiscuous Black women...we have the bitches, hos, stunts, hoochies, pigeons, chickenheads, and baby mamas put forth by Black men rappers.  The need to struggle against stereotyped images is still present.\\"  Let's hope this book will keep the discussion that invokes change alive.<br /><br />\\"Check It While I Wreck\\" is a thoroughly researched, erudite, and culturally relevant work that is virtually impossible to put down.

Only in this theft, the victims are murdered.  When Bernie is robbed himself, he can't help but wonder if the murderers have something to do with it.<br /><br />New York writer Lawrence Block, author of \\"Hope to Die\\" and a Mystery Writers of America Grand Master, uses some good old-fashioned style and humor to make this book a joy to read.

In Marita Golden's (Migrations of the Heart) new memoir, \\"Don't Play in the Sun,\\" she examines the intricacies of what it means to have grown up a dark-skinned African-American woman where women of lighter complexion were favored.<br /><br />The book commences with snippets of Golden's experiences dealing with color including the recollection of mother's stark warnings not to play in the sun or else she will have to get a light-skinned husband for the sake of her children.  The statement causes the young Golden to question her beauty and self-worth based on skin tone and hair texture throughout her entire life.  Witnessing intra-racial preference influences her decision not to American University instead of Howard because of the favoritism shown towards lighter-skinned Blacks at the all-Black school and influences how she views the portrayal of dark-skinned women on television.  The author also reminds the reader that light-skinned women are subjected to discrimination as well, particularly objectification and sexism.<br /><br />Golden recalls her world travels in Nigeria where many women surprisingly use skin-lightening creams to attract men, Cuba, where darker-skinned denizens hold menial jobs as maids, doormen, and even prostitutes while their lighter-skinned neighbors hold more visible, success-oriented positions, and Belgium, where her romance with a European man was, for the most part, socially accepted.<br /><br />The book not only serves as an intriguing memoir but also a critique on popular culture, social norms, and political practices throughout the world.  Golden offers her opinion on the popular Hip-Hop videos, the Grammy awards, the works of Zora Neale Hurston, and much more.  People of all colors and gender should be able to find something enlightening and didactic about \\"Don't Play in the Sun.\\"  Golden has penned a wonderful, succinct, page-turner that examines the complex relationship between lighter skinned and darker skinned people.

When best selling author Joe Goffman returns to his hometown due to his father's stroke, he ends up getting much more than he expected. It seems that his book, a thinly veiled fictional account of his growing up in the town, had caused a bit of an uproar when it was released. Fortunately for Joe, he was still living in New York City, where his greatest worries were feeling guilty for driving his Mercedes, psycho ex-girlfriends who call just to tell him how much of a jerk he is, and getting advice from his best and only friend Owen, his literary agent.<br /><br />Joe's return to Hope Falls is anything but dull. While his father's physical condition worsens, he begins to get to know his jock brother Brad and Brad's family a bit better. Joe forms a special bond with Brad's son Jared, a somewhat rebellious teenager who has a penchant for paintball and marijuana. Joe even gets re-acquainted with Carly, his high-school sweetheart and only woman he's ever loved and his best friend Wayne who is dying from AIDS. To top it off, Joel is presented with the opportunity to live out a childhood fantasy with one of his best friend's mom.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Joe must deal with the wrath of those who were affected by his writing, including an ex-con, a policeman, and the local basketball coach who practically owns the town. When the coach's wife greets Joe with a milkshake poured over his head, he knows he's in trouble. Even the book club gets in on the act by personally dumping their copies of his book on the front lawn. It seems that everyone wants a piece of him.<br /><br />The Book of Joe is a touching coming-of-age story told with a smidgen of emotion and a truckload of sarcasm and humor.

Black leaders such as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King had been assassinated after leading the battle for civil rights.  Hippies roamed the streets preaching free love; and the \\"black is beautiful\\" movement was in full effect.  And though there were troubles and hard times, there were still neighborhoods where folks treated either other decently, almost like family.  Next-door neighbors spanked your kids for you when you were away.  Block parties brought people together.  Even funerals brought out the love in others in the form of repasts, where neighbors cooked all kinds of food in hopes of bringing your spirits up.<br /><br />\\"Leaving Cecil Street\\" captures all of the above and then some.  The new novel from the author of Tumbling, Tempest Rising, and Blues Dancing tells the story of the goings on of two families who live next door to one another in West Philadelphia.  This includes Joe, a horn-playing lover of both jazz music and women who can't seem to keep his hands off the latter even though he is married.  Louise, his wife, is a wife and mother who refuses to see a dentist, even though half the teeth in her mouth are rotten.

A couple of hours later, I had devoured the book like a fat man at a buffet restaurant.  Needless to say, the water was warm and oh did it feel good.<br /><br />  Good Grief is the hilarious new book about surviving death.  No, that wasn't a typo.  The story is filled with both poignant and sardonic comments from Sophie Stanton (the main character) and how she copes with the loss of her husband Ethan to cancer.  Her spouse, who made his living as a software programmer, has gone on to a better place after merely three years of marriage.  Sophie, a PR manager, now finds herself a reluctant widow.  At only 36 years old, she is the youngest person in group counseling for the grief-stricken.<br /><br />  Sophie goes through all of the textbook stages of grief, including denial, anger, depression, and acceptance.  During the first stage, she questions the meaning of life and the senselessness of her job, trying to promote a patch used to increase male testosterone.  \\"...I feel like an imposter in a cubicle-like the artificial crabmeat of public relations managers.  Then there's the fact that I have to say \\"scrotum\\" to people all the time.  Is this really the color of my parachute?\\"<br /><br />  During the depression phase, she finds solace in staying home and watching TV shows like Cops.  \\"...now I see the attraction of the show.  It makes your own life seem pretty together.\\"  Truer words have never been written.<br /><br />  Though her deceased hubby's mother tries to help out the best she can, including helping with sending his belongings to Goodwill and spreading her son's ashes in the ocean. When she shows up to work in her robe and bunny slippers, her human resources manager gives her a much needed sabbatical.  It is after this moment when Sophie decides to leave the Silicon Valley city she and her husband had shared and packs up to move to Ashland, Oregon to be with her friend Ruth and her four-year old daughter to start all over again.<br /><br />  In Oregon, Sophie trades sunny California days for cloud-filled ones.  She rents out an unused bed and breakfast.  Then she donates a portion of her time to Big Brother/Big Sisters where she winds up getting matched with a self-mutilating, foul-mouthed teenager named Crystal instead of a young, sweetheart to play Candyland with (like she'd hoped for).  Afterwards, the road to recovery begins-a road that includes a new career and a new love interest.<br /><br />  Good Grief is a strikingly original work filled with charm, truth, and a heaping helping of sharp wit.  First time author Lolly Winston, who resides in California, succeeds at the difficult task of taking a delicate subject and having fun with it without being offensive. The novel reminded me a lot of Dave Eggers \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" in style and content.  I highly recommend this cleverly written book and hope the movie is in the works.

Her boyfriend Danny is a bit of a rebel who her parents want no part of.  Neither do they want a part of Sara and Danny's baby. Their main concern is that Sara will move on with her life after the birth so that she can follow her dream of attending college and living a good life.  But since Sara wants to be a part of the child's life, she has opted for an open adoption.  So finding Eva and George as adoptive parents was like a dream come true.  The middle-aged couple welcomes Sara into their home with open arms, taking snapshots with her, teaching her to drive, and even keeping souvenirs of her for the baby's sake.  She is allowed to come and go as she pleases.  They even treat her better than her own parents. But sometimes dreams become nightmares.<br />  Once Sara gives birth, things take a dramatic turn for the worse.  The adoptive parents no longer want to see her every day, telling her they need time to bond with the baby.  Truth is: Sara's maternal instincts and natural bonding with the child prove to be a bit too much for the jealous parents to handle.  Meanwhile, the naïve Sara continues to make her unwelcome presence felt by dropping by Eva and George's home on a daily basis, almost to the point of fanatical stalking.  But she can't help it.  She loves her newborn baby, Anne, even though she's not really her baby at all.  When Eva and George express their true feelings about Sara's frequent visits, she takes matters into her own hands, which forces the couple to make a drastic decision of their own.<br />  \\"Girls in Trouble\\" tells the story of a unique and original topic, an open adoption gone terribly wrong and how the lives of the people involved are affected.  The story spans over a sixteen year period.  The author does a splendid job at capturing the perspective of each person involved, including the birth parents, adoptive parents, birth grandparents, and the young girl who was adopted.  Caroline Leavitt (author of Coming Back to Me) has definitely brought her \\"A\\" game to the table with her crisp and intriguing writing style that will make you smile.<br />  Though the slow-paced beginning of the story contains a few clich&eacute;s about childbirth and adoption, it gets a full head of steam and continues its pace for the remainder of the tale.  By the story's end, you will surely crave more and more.  \\"Girls in Trouble\\" is a captivating story that will surely find its way beneath the arms of a plethora of loving fans of all ages.ne Leavitt (author of Coming Back to Me) has definitely brought her \\"A\\" game to the table with her crisp and intriguing writing style that will make you smile.<br />     Though the slow-paced beginning of the story contains a few clichés about childbirth and adoption, it gets a full head of steam and continues its pace for the remainder of the tale.

This includes his frustrated mother Alice, who believes her son's condition can be cured if he \\"sees the light,\\" Maude, the older and inquisitive neighbor down the street whom he believes he will one day bed, and Jimmy, his best friend and co-worker who gives him bad advice about women and dating, provides him with skin flicks, and even teaches him how to masturbate to them properly.<br /><br />When Alice hatches a plan for Lenny to kidnap her estranged son Jack, a policeman, the plot thickens.  Lenny has no idea he's kidnapping his own brother, not only because his sibling left home over ten years prior but also because his mental capacity will not allow him to remember.  Lenny's only concern is pleasing his mother, who threatens him with a game of \\"Careful,\\" which usually involves some form of physical abuse or mental torture towards him.  Alice's agenda is to get Jack to admit why he left and to have him help Lenny see the light.  That is, after she decides to release him from being bound and gagged in the attic.  Meanwhile, Jack has an astonishing secret that must be revealed before the story ends.<br /><br />\\"Careful!\\" is told with breakneck pacing and incredible fervor.  First time author Richard Madelin, who resides in England, weaves in and out of monologue with style and control.  The protagonist is a fascinating character, reminiscent of Steinbeck's main character in \\"Of Mice and Men.\\"  The author's unique style of writing, mostly in inner-monologue, creates a fresh and original experience for the reader.

Taz had been the poor neighborhood kid who gladly exchanged giving Imani piano lessons for an occasional meal at the request of Imani's father Maceo, a failed jazz musician.  Having lost her mother, a wonderful singer in her own right, Imani is left with her memories of her and an unfinished song she left behind.  Maceo would love for Imani to follow in her mother's footsteps but Imani would rather set her own course, rapping over tracks that her boyfriend has put together to cut a CD.<br /><br />While freestyle rhyming at the local black university, Imani meets Professor Hopson, an uptight but brilliant twenty-five year old professor of music.  The meeting sparks a bet between Hopson and his boss, Chairman Perkins.  Perkins wants Hopson to change Imani from a raw, hip-hop street girl to a classy, jazz vocalist.  If Hopson wins, the chairman will enter Hopson's paper for the local grant competition.  If he loses, his rival's paper will be entered.<br /><br />Not only does Hopson school Imani in song but he also teaches her diction, ballroom dancing, and other forms of etiquette. As Hopson and Imani work closer and closer together, it is inevitable that they begin to fall for one another.  After this occurs, Imani must choose between Hopson and Taz, hip-hop and jazz.<br /><br />\\"My Fine Lady\\" is a good read.  While the plot of this Cinderella tale is not that original and the story is somewhat predictable, it is not difficult to fall head over heels with the author's style of writing.  Nearly every chapter is introduced with exquisitely written, thought-provoking prose giving the book a unique and inviting style of its own.  (\\"Envy the sun that has horizons to brighten.

In my business humor book, \\"A Job Ain't Nothing But Work,\\" I made a joke about everyone selling solutions these days.  \\"My wife won't give me any.  Got a solution for that?\\"  But in the new book \\"The New Solution Selling,\\" solutions are all business.  It begins with a clear definition of what a solution selling is: \\"a system of methods that includes tools, job aids, techniques, and procedures that help salespeople and sales teams navigate the selling steps that close more sales faster.\\"  After this clear definition is given, author Keith M. Eades, founder and president of Sales Performance International and Solution Selling Inc, uses his expertise in sales for teaching the reader the necessary steps of selling, including pre-planning, cold calling, and the very important closing of the deal.<br /><br />  \\"The New Solution Selling\\" is not your run of the mill business book that typically renames and regurgitates business practices that have been in place for years.  Instead, the book not only gives valuable information on the sales process but it also gives reliable examples.  This includes sample pre-calling letters, thank you letters, and letters that ask for more business.  Examples can be put into place immediately after reading the related chapter.  It is perfect for the salesperson looking to penetrate the Fortune 500 market.<br /><br />  The book addresses major issues in the sales world, including what to do when your top salespeople are promoted to management, how to respond when you're not the first in line, and how to identify and respond to the pains your customers are facing.<br /><br />  Having graduated from business school and worked in sales for a number of years, I can tell you that this book is the real deal.  It has found a permanent place on my business book shelf right next to \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\" and \\"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.\\"  This is the kind of book that should be on college campuses all across America.

When he hacks into the corporate computers to finance an expensive shindig for a friend, a retiring dock worker, he must face the consequences.  His abrasive boss, CEO Nick Wyatt, gives him a choice: go directly to jail for embezzlement or go to work for Wyatt's chief competitor, Trion Industries, as a spy.  When Cassidy chooses the latter, the intrigue of \\"Paranoia\\" begins.<br /><br />Cassidy, a low-level employee, is coached by Nick Wyatt and Dr. Judith Bolton, an executive coach who holds a Ph. D. in behavioral psychology.  They teach him the ins and outs of espionage, including giving detailed biographies on Trion employees and instructions on how to use the latest in spy gadgetry to gather the information they need.<br /><br />While at Trion, Cassidy must become a different person.  He must appear to be an intelligent innovator of one of Wyatt's most successful products rather than the slacker he truly is without getting caught.  When he gains the trust of the CEO, Jock Goddard, he is given the raise of a lifetime and access to much of the secure information he is looking to steal.  A moral dilemma commences when Cassidy realizes that Goddard is an honest man of integrity who he enjoys working for as opposed to the tough and threatening Nick Wyatt.  Can he gather the enough information on Trion's secret project AURORA to keep Wyatt off his back without completely ruining Goddard or his own new lavish lifestyle, including a budding romance with Alana, a gorgeous Trion employee?<br /><br />Meanwhile he must consider his personal life, including the caretaking of his grumpy, dying father (which he pays for); and his friendship with Seth, a local bartender and paralegal.  Though the signs of his newfound success become apparent, including his new Porsche and a luxury apartment, he must use discretion when discussing his new position or run the risk of having his cover blown.<br /><br />Paranoia is a nail biting story of corporate espionage and morality told with incredible wit from bestselling author Joseph Finder (High Crimes).  The book will have you laughing out loud from the onset.  Although it loses some of its wit towards the middle of the book; and the unit introductions with espionage definitions seem a bit out of place for a story on corporate spying, the story will still grab your attention and keep it right until its surprising ending.

This is the dilemma Vanella Morris is faced with in the new book \\"Counting Raindrops through a Stained Glass Window\\" by Cherlyn Michaels.<br /><br />Morris, the main character, is a woman who's got it going on.  She works for a Fortune 500 company, drives a luxury car, and is in love with her long time boyfriend Alton Goode.  Her only problem seems to be a battle of the bulge.  But after witnessing the turmoil marriage has caused for her best friends and for her parents, she has decided she does not want any part of it.  Unfortunately, Alton is an old-fashioned, marriage-minded man who has just popped the question.  Vanella is left with the decision of marrying Goode or the consequences of losing him forever.<br /><br />The book also deals with Morris's troubles with family and friends, including her best friend Synda, who trapped Vanella's college boyfriend into marriage after cheating with him, her sister Jaelene, who believes she must buy a man's love, her brother Kizaar, who has a hard time getting along with their father, and Morris's parents, whose tumultuous relationship is the main reason she does not want to fall into the same marriage trap.  Morris must resolve issues with her friends and family if she wants to move on with a relationship of her own.  Before it all ends, secrets will be revealed, friendships will dissolve, and relationships will change.<br /><br />One thing to be said about the author is that she describes a scene with great detail and clarity.  This especially holds true when discussing the two cities in which the story takes place, St. Louis and Cleveland.  The book reads like a love letter to both cities.  Michaels also does a great job in capturing the essence of conversation, particularly when all of the girlfriends get together to discuss men.  Her writing style reminded me of a combination of E. Lynn Harris and Terry McMillan with a tad more sex appeal.<br /><br />The only problem with the book is that it gives so much descriptive detail that it tends to get a little light on plot.  It would have been nice to read more about the steamy relationship between Vanella and Alton and even more about the relationship between Synda and her husband Tucker.<br /><br />Still, \\"Counting Raindrops through a Stained Glass Window,\\" is a sexy, entertaining first novel that is exciting to read.

She is a physically abusive mother who not only spanks her children with a leather belt but also burns their flesh with smoldering pokers straight from the fireplace, pours steaming hot coffee in their faces, and punches them in the face sending teeth flying and causing eyes to swell like a world class pugilist.  She encourages the children to steal for the good of the family.  She even forces her teenage daughters into a life of domestic servitude and prostitution (a life she knows all too well) for the extra money it brings into the household, which she always claims for herself.  Psychologically, she's even worse, ranking her children by skin tone, claiming the lighter skinned ones are more valuable than the darker ones.  When some of them make plans to leave her house for good, she either makes them feel guilty enough to stay or finds a way to sabotage their plans.<br /><br />  The story is told from the perspective of Tangy Mae, Rozelle's darkest and most intelligent child.  The setting is the fictitious, rural town Pakersfield, Georgia.  Tangy Mae, who is 13 when the book commences in 1958, dreams of someday being the first in her family to finish high-school in order to make something of her life.  But there are many obstacles, including Jim Crow laws, racism, poverty, and most of all her sadistic mother who wants her to quit school to get a job for the purpose of helping take care of the family, which includes nine other siblings, all of them by different men.<br /><br />  Though Tangy Mae is the storyteller, the lives of her brothers and sisters are given just as much attention as she.  This includes Tarabelle, Tangy's strong and brave older sister who hates her mother for forcing her to service men in The Farmhouse, Harvey, her older brother who wants to marry an undertaker's daughter, Martha Jean, her deaf younger sister who falls for an older man for whom Tangy also has a crush, and Sam her brother whose dreams of equal opportunity leave him framed for a crime he didn't commit.  When Mushy, Tangy's older sister, returns to Georgia after a four-year, self-imposed exile to Cleveland, she fills her brothers' and sisters' heads with ideas on following in her footsteps-far away from their abusive mother.  Meanwhile, Rozelle will stop at nothing to keep her children home with her.<br /><br />  \\"The Darkest Child\\" is a beautifully written work of art that is hard to put down.  Its descriptive writing is reminiscent of classic works from Alice Walker, Ralph Ellison, and Ernest Hemingway.  Consider the following passage as an example: [And the sound of silence was frightening. Rain pounded the tin roof like a thousand demons marching for their master, and the roof yielded.  Liquid curses splashed down upon our heads and into the waiting vessels.  In the gray shadows of a rainy dusk, the clock on the table ticked rhythmically, but the hands never moved.  They were stuck.]  Simply beautiful.<br /><br />  This novel will undoubtedly cause you to cringe with its graphic depiction of violence.  The characters will make you cry and laugh.  They will also leave you longing for the escape they desire.
