It is also a portrait of twentieth century totalitarianism and its cynicism, because Moczarski actually was a resistance fighter himself, but belonging to the \\"wrong\\" (non-Communist) resistance, was equated and put in the same cell with this Nazi criminal after the war. This should be compulsory reading both for unreconstructed communists and right-wing holocaust deniers.	2002-04-02

However, I couldn't help noticing one very bad  misunderstanding, which spoils the whole book: Davies got the outcome of Ireland's civil war wrong. He tells us de Valera's Republicans won; in fact they were defeated by the Free Staters.<br />In fairness to Davies: of course de Valera eventually won the elections and became Ireland's strong man, a fact that may well overshadow the actual outcome of the war. Besides, I know by my own experience how impossible it is to get the gist of Ireland's political history, and I sympathise very much with Davies's difficulties. But still, it is a fact that had the Republican side won the war, today's IRA would not exist - the IRA idea is based on the belief that the Republican side was Ireland's real, legal government and army. So, Davis has misunderstood something very fundamental and essential - and being a professional historian who actually has been able to grasp Poland's political history, he should simply have done better.	2001-10-18

Of course, it is in the old orthography, but it is a mistake to think that it would make the reading of, say, Seán Bán Mac Meanman or the Grianna brothers any easier: most unusual words found in them are included rather in the Ó Donaill dictionary than in Dinneen. So, it is a mistake to think that Dinneen covers Ulster Irish any better.<br />However, some of Dinneen's attempts to define Irish words do capture the essence of traditional usage better than Ó Donaill. Besides, Dinneen doesn't take it for granted that the dictionary user already understands Irish English (Ó Donaill does, a fact that leads to such hilarious &quot;translations&quot; as &quot;pampooties&quot; for &quot;pampútaí&quot; - forgetting that a Britsh, an American or, say, a Finnish reader, although familiar with standard English, does not always understand such Hiberno-Englishisms as &quot;pampooties&quot;) and thus often adds explanations for the uninitiated. But Dinneen does not organise the dictionary articles very well, and often he is as vague as to be incomprehensible. And of course, today's most current meaning of a word isn't always the one that comes first, or even among the first, in Dinneen.<br />Dinneen's is an indispensable tool for a writer in Irish or a scholar doing research, but general learners should first of all get a copy of Ó Donaill. However, sooner or later you must get accustomed to the old orthography, and then you'll need Dinneen.	2000-10-04

The language as taught here is Helsinki street slang, which differs substantially from the literary standard. This need not be a shortcoming, because the traditional way to stick to the standard is frustrating enough for the communicatively (not academically) oriented learner who prefers to be able to speak a language instead of primarily writing and reading it.<br />A more severe fault is the fact that the book sometimes clearly violates the standard rules about writing compound words, sometimes rather haphazardly printing a compound word as two separate words. However, even this is a kind of error which would be committed very readily by a native speaker lacking in education.<br />Even the vocabulary incorporates some very vulgar colloquialisms not normally taught to learners. <br />All told, this book, rather bizarrely, teaches Finnish as it is spoken and written by Helsinki skinheads. This could be, of course, a caustic commentary about the kind of Finns the foreigner is most likely to come into contact with. However, pedagogically it does not seem too bad, and I cannot dismiss its peculiar innovations out of hand.	2000-09-27

There are interesting dilemmas and conflicts which just don't get fair treatment, such as his reaction upon the sixties radicalism. It is  justified enough that he feels disgusted by the well-fed students  protesting against this and that while he has experienced middle-aged Black  and Hispanic women longing for education and schooling; and actually he  should have written more about this than about the rest.  But the point is  that the latter half of the book is just a spiritless catalogue of his  achievements or lack thereof, with little or no inspiration or interest in  what he is writing about.<br />Mr McCourt's memoirs are not half as original  and interesting as the hype promises, and this latter part should have been  rewritten, or left unpublished. Were it not for Angela's Ashes, this book  had never had the slightest chance to be printed - and justly so. It feels  like a mediocre celeb memoir - but unfortunately, it was written by the  celeb himself, not a ghostwriter.	2000-06-20

I admit that it is readable,  but thae fact that this book was such a success in America is more indicative of Ireland's changing image in the States than of the book's quality. Ireland used to be  portrayed in a sugar-sentimental way in Hollywood movies; now the tide has  turned, and Ireland is supposed to be portrayed in a vicious, negativist  way. I do not question Mr McCourt's right to dislike Ireland, his emotions  are genuine and authentic. However, his unashamed admiration for America,  although probably an authentic description of the postcolonial Irish mind  in his youth, is not tempered by any kind of distance or irony, and makes  the end of the book look like a kind of American egoist-nationalist crank  pamphlet: Soviet-style disgusting propaganda, no literature. The  love-affair with the dying girl smacks more of errand-boy folklore than  experience, and as a pornographic story motif it is a well-worn  cliché.<br />It should not be inferred that this kind of harshly critical view  of Irish society is something new in literature about Ireland. This has  been done before, in Ireland, and in the Irish language (Breandán Ó  hEithir's Lig Sinn i gCathú, and Pádraig Ua Maoileoin's novels, for  instance).	2000-06-05

Steve Bruce has, as he expresses it himself, based this book on &quot;long unstructured interviews, or as we sociologists call it, talking to people&quot;. It does show. Sometimes I wonder whether he hasn't gone a  little too far in understanding the views of his interviewees and in  sympathising with them. This does not need to be a fault, however, for here  the loyalists talk themselves about what they want and how they feel.  <br />The author has succeeded in highlighting some important and little-known  facts, such as the existence of rational political initiatives from  loyalists (the policy doocuments Common Sense and Beyond the Religious  Divide). However he also tells us why this kind of documents do not need to  mirror the views of the loyalist community as a whole.<br />Together with  Fionnuala O'Connor's In Search of a State and Tim Pat Coogan's history of  the IRA, this book constitutes a vital part of the recommended reading  package for everybody wanting to understand the Troubles.	2000-05-30

I felt somewhat irritated by Chuckie's business ideas, which seemed to depart too far from the plausible (because a good  satire is always plausible enough); but there is something horribly and  hilariously realistic about them being taken seriously by American  businessmen. It is also a fact that the author's politics interfere too  much with the book: his depiction of the Irish-language scene is simply  unjust. On the other hand, the bomb blast episode is one of the best parts  of the book, and the fact that it has been narrated in a different way is  very justified indeed.	2000-05-25

Duanaire includes the most important poems in Irish from the dark centuries  of the Penal times, as well as a thorough introduction in two languages. I  cannot say anything about the English translations, as I prefer not to read  them; the Irish version of the introduction is not only interesting and  well-written, but also good Irish - not the customary &quot;excuse&quot; or  &quot;alibi&quot; Irish you would axpect in such a context.<br />I have little  objections to the selection; however I would not have considered it a waste  of space to include Merriman's &quot;Midnight Court&quot; in its entirety.

It teaches a living dialect of the labguage, instead of maintaining the  fiction of the existence of a standard language outside the pulpits of  official scribes. It also jettisons boldly those features of the standard  grammar which are not alive anymore in spoken Irish. This is, of course, a  mixed blessing. On the one hand it makes the learners more friendly towards  native spoken Irish - no more written-language pedants with a hideous  accent trying to tell the natives how they should speak Irish. On the other  hand, reading literature after this course may require some readjustments  to the more complex morphology of the written language. However, the book  duly highlights the most difficult and idiomatic features of Irish grammar,  instead of leaving the learner with a developed &quot;what's it in  English&quot; syndrome, as too many textbooks do, thus producing   intermediate learners with a better-than-native grasp of the genitive, but  with no idea at all of the distinction between the two verbs &quot;to  be&quot;.  Siadhail firmly tells us about the most idiomatic parts of  Irish, equipping us very well to meet the reality of the Gaeltacht.	1998-11-06

US	51194334	R105OS434ABLYL	0844238007	726692154	Irish: A Complete Course for Beginners (Teach Yourself)	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Relatively good introduction, but more is needed	The colleague who reviewed this book before me, said that this is the book to start with. I agree, but I would definitely like to add that more is needed if you are heading for the Gaeltacht. The grammar part is not as  extensive as it should be, and there are large section of grammar which are  not highlighted as they should be even in a beginners book. When you have  mastered this one, you should try Mchel  Siadhail's &quot;Learning  Irish&quot;, which makes no concesions to the more or less hypothetical  standard language, which is preferred by Diarmuid  S.
