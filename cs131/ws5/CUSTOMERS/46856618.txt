Just how many submarine plots are there any way?  <br /> <br />A submarine is either attacking, running or there is a cat and mouse between two or more subs. Everything else is a variation on those themes. <br /> <br />That said, this is a masterful piece of writing. <br /> <br />TYPHOON is the story of a Typhoon class boomer that suddenly appears off the Kola Peninsula. (There was supposed to be a treaty that scrapped these killers, evidently the Russians forgot about this one.) You can always count on your former commie to be cheating somewhere. <br /> <br />The nearest submarine on station is ordered to prevent the Typhoon from navigating the Arctic ice pack and being delivered to the new bad guys (the Chinese).  <br /> <br />The American commander interprets his orders as license to sink the Typhoon. <br /> <br />Not to spoil the story. Many things happen under the water and things get very desperate. <br /> <br />This is the best submarine novel I have read since the Hunt for Red October.  <br /> <br />I liked it alot.	2005-10-06

It is a dangerous creature that is quite upset. It is on a rampage and people are dieing. <br /> <br />The cover blurb compares this book to King Kong. That may be over hype, but I'm not quite sure. <br /> <br />The story goes as follows: Marine Biologist Zack Wallace is a world class scientist. He has developed a lure that allows him to photograph the elusive giant squid. There is a terrible accident 3000 feet underwater.  <br /> <br />Zack's head is a bit screwed up. He finds he is afraid of the water, and eventually ends up at Loch Ness. Now the reall fun begins. <br /> <br />This is a page turner that will keep you reading deep into the night. You might think you're safe on land, but you never know with this book. <br /> <br />This is one of the better books to show up this year.	2005-10-06

US	46856618	R49OYXCNPPGQ9	076530239X	792846204	Against All Enemies	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Riveting	This is one of those \\"what-if\\" scenarios that gets you thinking. <br /> <br />The State of Idaho decides that it is tired of onerous Federal control and events are engineered to create a confrontation between a state's right to determine its affairs and the need to maintain the union. <br /> <br />In many ways the issues raised by the Civil War are re-examined, and the author makes a clear distinction that in this fight the bad guys might be the good guys. <br /> <br />Some people might suggest that it can't happen here, but since the start of the current century we have witnessed an attack on American soil and the destruction of an American City. WHile events might not unfold as Harold Coyle envisions, something like AGAINST ALL ENEMIES  is not as far fetched as some might believe. <br /> <br />The book was written in 1996, in the aftermath of the OKC Federal Building bombing.  <br /> <br />I think it is his best book to date.	2005-09-16

Over hype on the jacket cover is always bit dangerous, because it raises reader expectations. <br /> <br />This book about dinosaurs starts on the moon during the Apollo 17 landing. Preston takes bit of trivia and runs with the idea. However, it is obvious that Preston's true love is for the T-Rex and the sexiness of the man eater. <br /> <br />There is murder and greed and avarice galore in this book, but I must agree with some of the other reviews. None of the characters really grab me. <br /> <br />This is an easy read, a fast paced book, and maybe you don't need well developed characters, but being plot driven it is predictable that certain things will happen. <br /> <br />Since I have read everything Douglas Preston has put out either solo or in concert with Lincoln Child, I remain a big fan. It was a no brainer to buy his latest effort.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed the tale.	2005-09-08

AN eccentric inventor comes up with a new power technology (that sounds alot like Zero Point Energy) that basically obsoletes everything else. So pooling some spare change, they build a spaceship that can get a crew of 5 to Mars and back inside a week. <br /> <br />While the characters have a certain charm, there really aren't many surprises in this story, and you have suspend belief a bit when it comes to all the family members who have just-the-right skills necessary to prepare RED THUNDER for launch. <br /> <br />I'll we looking for more from this author.	2005-09-07

US	46856618	R24SAJCCZTQNLU	0316011770	454028739	The Historian	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Jane Austen meets Dracula	The HISTORIAN is a classic novel written in the form of an 18th century gothic novel. Like a Jane Austen novel, the plot and characters are revealed inch by inch as if peeling back the layers of an onion. <br /> <br />Dacula is always an intriguing subject, and unlike the Anne Rice novels, this book does not seek to ennoble vampires, but sees them for the horrendous evil they are.  <br /> <br />This is a well written book, although at 640 pages it is quite a load. I think the same story could have been written in about 450 pages, and that is my only real criticism.	2005-08-18

The gist of the story is that Tommy Carmellini stumbles into an execution at a CIA safe house and barely survives the encounter. Before he has a chance to catch his breath, Tommy is running for his life and everywhere he turns the bad guys show up. <br /> <br />Without giving anything away, the book basically works except for the relationship between Tommy and an on-again/off-again love interest named Dorsey O'Shea. The end of the book is too cute by half, and when you sit back and think about it, the plot turns on an incredible coincidence.  <br /> <br />But if you can ignore the logical incongruence, this book is much better than his dreadful SAUCER. <br /> <br />The style comes across as a smart-alek DEEP BLACK without the edginess. <br /> <br />The subject matter goes back to the Cold War, which is rather odd considering the current conflict, but I suspect even a successful author must deal with agents and publishers that are skittish when it comes to confronting the War on Terror.	2005-08-09
US	46856618	R2BXWXD3AP6GIE	0765346923	594596317	The Big Secret	Books	1	1	6	N	N	Ridiculous	This is a whodunnit. However, every significant clue (in this rather clueless attempt) relies on a psychic relationship between twin sisters. I could handle this okay if I thought I was reading Stephen King, but the author keeps going back to same formula that he used for his first set of clues. It especially starts to stink after one of the twins is dead and continues to speak from the grave. <br /> <br />Now if I wanted to read something about dream walkers, I would pick up Robert Jordan's WHEEL OF TIME. I don't expect the same device to be used in what is pushed off as a political thriller. <br /> <br />Some of the major characters are thinly disguised simulacrums for well known folks. Based on the short bio at the end of the book, one might believe the author has an ax to grind. <br /> <br />I try never to give a book 1 or 2 stars. I really try to find something positive, because it takes alot of work and sweat to churn out a manuscript, but this heap should have never made it by an agent, much less an editor.	2005-07-31

At one point in the book one of the characters asks why anyone would believe this crap? <br /> <br />I was asking myself the same question, but the book plunged forward, skirting close to the edge of a cliff. The gist of the plot is that Russia decides it wants to bring back the Tsar. Why? We're never told, just that there is this commission that is going to pick a new Tsar in six days and the vote must be unaminous. <br /> <br />Six days - right. <br /> <br />Miles Lord, a dufus lawyer, who manages to piece the century old clues together that lead to the Romanov heir, but can't figure out that every time he calls his boss, people show up to kill him. <br /> <br />Too bad they didn't succeed. Any character this dumb deserves a dirt nap. <br /> <br />Thrillers are suppose to accelerate towards the end. This one s-l-o-w-s down. <br /> <br />Save yourself the trouble, read something else.	2005-07-30
US	46856618	RE6ZADBVV6E6G	0060530391	805102411	The Kill Clause	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Star Chamber Redux	First of all, the writing is good. The author has talent and flair, but the story lacks cohesiveness. I liked the character development. I thought the main characters were well rounded and about as bright as a box of rocks. <br /> <br />This book is the STAR CHAMBER only with Deputy Marshals instead of judges. The main character Tim Rackley approaches apparent injustices in the criminal justice system by taking the law into his own hands and whacking the bad guys (it just isn't clear if there any good guys in this tale). <br /> <br />The initial enthusiam for vigilante justice degrades to what-have-I-gotten-into to something akin to I've-written-300-pages-and-how-do-I-end-this book. Personally, I would have killed off the main character rather than go through the strained, improbable and fixed ending.	2005-07-25
US	46856618	R2JTI12IJLNFI1	0451411668	977344007	Emergency Deep	Books	5	9	11	N	N	Great New Series	EMERGENCY DEEP is the start of a new series (at least that's what I understand) as such it is a very interesting start. <br /> <br />Let's start out with the positives: <br /> <br />1) Michael Dimercurio is the best submarine writer (apologies to my friend Joe Buff) today.  <br />2) He draws on his experience at the Naval Academy and his service in the submarine force. <br />3) I liked how he established his characters Dillinger and Vornado. Having known a few other guys to come out of Anapolis, I wonder how much of the Whitehead story is made up. Again the level of detail could only come from some familiar with life as a midshipman. <br /> <br />The only real weakness in this book is the CIA. They just aren't that bright or ruthless. We might like to think differently, but current events suggests otherwise. <br /> <br />I liked what he did with the Alfa at the end of the book, but the Agency subterfuge was pretty obvious.  <br /> <br />Of course, I read Michael Dimercurio books for the underwater action and these are second to none. <br /> <br />As this was the last book of my summer vacation, I was greatly entertained.	2005-07-04

While the enemy is more up-to-date (the Red Chinese), the stakes nonetheless are  the same. <br /> <br />George Shreed is dead. Long live George. Was he a double agent, stretching back over decades of deceit? Was a brilliant spymaster, who managed to land a master stroke against his enemies? Did Chen control Shreed or was it the other way around? And what was/is Chinese Checkers? <br /> <br />This book takes up where TOP HOOK ends. Only things are not going well for the good guys. I loved the tug of war and the not quite bad and not quite good characters. <br /> <br />The one thing I really don't like in this book is the hero Alan Craik. I think he's an over zealous hot dog that should have been yanked out of the Navy. Leaving that aside, the book has a marvelous pacing that keeps you reading well into the night. <br /> <br />	2005-06-23

They also happened to be best buds growing up together.<br /><br />Then there is a Texas Sheriff, who is real crooked, leaves a string of dead bodies behind, flies to Trinidad to catch up to a wife he really doesn't like.<br /><br />I think the book's basic idea is okay, but the characters and the pacing just didn't work for me.	2005-06-22

I guess you'll have to be the judge. <br /> <br />This is the story of a 8 man squad dropped behind enemy lines in the first Gulf War that were part of the great SCUD hunt. Things did not go well for these guys. Of the eight, 3 were killed, 4 captured and 1 made it to freedom. <br /> <br />This is a pretty intense story, and from what we now know of Saddam's Murder Inc. inside Iraq and the continued blood thirsty killers still on the loose, there is a loud dollop of truth coming out of this book. <br /> <br />To say I enjoyed the story is misleading. These soldiers went through the ringer. I don't get the Rambo comparison here. What I read was a credible account of highly trained troops doing what they were trained to do in a very hostile environment. <br /> <br />Read this book because it is important. <br /> <br />It is also well written.	2005-06-19

A navy fighter pilot lost over Iraq during the opening hours of Desert Storm is declared KIA, and Saddam does nothing to change anyone's mind. A corrupt CIA station chief knows that Raz Rasmussen is still alive, but he has his own agenda - it doesn't include rescuing an American POW. <br /> <br />Fast forward to the present day WOT, and the rumors that someone is holding an American POW. Brick Maxwell has to watch his six, not just for roving Iranian fighters and shoddy aircraft maintenance, but for the CIA who doesn't want him bring his squadron mate home. <br /> <br />This book has the right amount of action and pacing to make it a winner. <br /> <br />A great read.	2005-06-18

There are plenty of action scenes, and a good deal of carrier off the deck sequences in the book. The writers' naval experience shows. <br /> <br />Basically, everything is going great for the Craiks (for about 50 pages), then the government goes after both of them with a vengeance. <br /> <br />I think that once the government comes after you though, it is pretty hard to get things turned around. There will always be that taint and suspicion lurking in the background. Who knows maybe that is what the authors plan for the future. <br /> <br />A very pleasant read.	2005-06-15

What if the Germans invaded America at the turn of the last century. <br /> <br />I found myself intrigued by the problems posed for the America military and political establishment, as they scramble to play catch up in terms of men, materiel and technology. As a gun buff, I recognized many of the arguements related to single shot vs repreaters. <br /> <br />Many people compared this book to Turtledove. I thought this was more realistic than Turtledove (and to be quite blunt, I have tired of his prose and his predictable approach to things). <br /> <br />Alternate history books can be either really cheesy or pretty good. 1901 falls into the latter category. <br /> <br />Finally, I could not help but draw the similarities described in this book to the current War on Terror. We have a president, facing a peace-at-any-price crowd at home and a seemingly intractable foe bent on a murderous agenda. The copyright on this book is 1995! Again another fascinating look into a history that might have been.	2005-06-14

It is painful to watch him move from one disaster to the next - still managing to out smart the bad guys.  <br /> <br />This starving artist continues to find people who speak English and seems to have enough money. <br /> <br />This is certainly not up to Mr. Case's previous efforts.	2005-06-12

Is there a bad guy out to get them? <br /> <br />Yes, yes and yes - why else would we read a David Poyer book.  <br /> <br />Is it realistic - for the most part. I could have done without the four-letter diatribes and the knuckle-headed excesses engendered in a mixed crew, but that is also part of the story. <br /> <br />I swallowed this one in 2 sittings.	2005-05-30

You trust your government to be honest and forthright.    I bet you believe in the tooth fairy too.    If so, then maybe you should try something else.    But if you want riveting read, NIGHT FALL is for you. The subject matter is TWA 800 - you remember the mechanical failure in the empty fuel tank.

John Corey attends the fifth anniversdary of the disaster/crash/terrorist incident, which just happens to be two months before September 11th.

Knowing how to start a book is one thing, figuring out how to end it is another.    As a techno thriller it is better than some, but occaisionally an author needs to consider reality. Without putting a spoiler into this review, the ending of this book just couldn't happen and have the good guys survive.     Leave the ending aside, I thought this Deep Black installment moved away from the razzle-dazzle (which was good) and left the action to the Deep Black Agents (I wish I could feel something for the characters).    This book rolls along pretty well.    Will I read another Deep Black, probably. Will I expect a masterpiece - uh-uh.	2005-05-21

Very bad guy does many bad things to good guys buddies and friends. The good guy hunts him down for a final show down. <br /> <br />So much for the plot, this was a very enjoyable romp. Marcus Wynne knows his guns and hardware so there were no .38 Glock revolvers in this book. What sets this book apart is the Aborignal mysticism that is the core of the fight between Charley and Alfie. <br /> <br />I also appreciate that Wynne moves the plot right along. My one complaint is that everything was very pat and tied together. Life is a bit messier than this.  <br /> <br />Oh, one other thing it is pretty clear that Wynne likes a Glock 30.

Tangled into this story is romance between David Gordon and Tory Breen, who stumbled across the conspiracy somewhere around page 300. <br /> <br />While I find the idea that people would attempt to manipulate a consitutional convention plausible, the the bad guys become cartoonish in their goose stepping manner. I felt the book was about 300 pages too long. I really didn't care for the main characters all that much (except for the cigar chomping general) and the ending got a bit ragged. <br /> <br />What I did like was the idea that things could go very badly in a consitutional convention and maybe it would be best to try and fix the ssyetm we have rather than tinker with it radically. There are elements of a SEVEN DAYS IN MAY conspiracy, but this is kind of sprung on the reader towards the end. <br /> <br />	2005-05-02

Only these days they have abandoned the ruble in favor of the dollar, exchanged funny looking uniforms for $5,000 suits and their MiGs for G5 business jets. <br /> <br />The only criticism I have for this book is that everything gets wrapped up very neatly, and my experience with Russians is that nothing ever gets put back together exactly right.	2005-04-19

This is a novel worth such an indulgence. <br /> <br />Agent Pendergast is back, brimming with Renaissance trivia. The incredible murders where the victims are burnt to a crisp from the inside out conjures a morbid fascination that Satan has come to claim his due. I kept coming back to Dr. Faustus and the selling of his soul. <br /> <br />The authors reunite Detective D'Agosta and Pendergast as they unravel the clues. The tag team nature of their relationship is quite satisfying. However, everything that happens in the first 300 pages is designed to lead the reader to the wrong conclusions. <br /> <br />Some reviews have complained that Brimstone is comic bookish. No, it is a supernatural detective story that isn't quite as outerworldly as it appears. The authors always come back to a scientific basis for what is going on. <br /> <br />The motive for the murders is just as outlandish the murder weapon. But that's what this book is. It rides on the edge of credibility without tumbling off the edge. <br /> <br />Finally, the mysterious goings on at the spooky Manhattan Mansion get clarified a bit, and the set up for coming attractions is prepared. <br /> <br />I eagerly look forward to the next installment!	2005-03-08
US	46856618	R2XS157B4ZLAYO	0066214130	57180289	State of Fear	Books	4	10	14	N	N	More meaningful than an eggplant	My first edict when evaluating a novel is: the book must entertain before it makes you think. <br /> <br />STATE OF FEAR is definitely a book that makes you think. Warning: If you believe the world is overheating due to industrialization and the evil automobile, maybe you should buy something else. <br /> <br />The gist of the book is a bunch Eco-Terrorists who wish to manufacture an event in order to shape the debate. Their motivation for this action comes from the fact that the facts are not with them. They are losing the intellectual argument regarding global warming. <br /> <br />Mr. Crichton goes to great lengths (including foot notes) to make his case that hard science does not support the global warming theory. This is the reason this book is not 5 stars, because there are times when the Kenner character gets a little too preachy. <br /> <br />Now to balance this off, I enjoyed the debate put forth between his characters. There's section in the book around page 400 where one character (dare I suggest a thinly disguised version of Martin Sheen) says that the great redwoods are the guardians of the earth and response is something like they have as much to say to us as an eggplant. <br /> <br />The book moves along very nicely. The plot is intriguing, although, I would have liked a little more explanation about the cavitation machines. And I enjoyed the transformation of the Evans character as he goes from flaming eco-freak/lawyer to thoughtful person considering both sides of the argument. <br /> <br />Well worth money.	2005-03-04

This book moves quite fast and you need to pay attention otherwise, you will lose the plot.  <br /> <br />The writing style for this book reflects the anxiety of the main characters as they track the components for a dirty bomb through Central Asia. If that was the intent then the authors achieved their goal. <br /> <br />However, I think they missed an interesting subplot by not playing up the friction between Corrine (the lady lawyer) and Ferguson (who is trying to get killd before he dies of cancer). <br /> <br />This is an average thriller against the back drop of the War on Terror.	2005-02-20

There is lot going on in this foundational first book.  <br /> <br />The Qar move across the shadow line towards the northern kingdoms.

But there are others who have heard about Max's treasure and they want it as well.

What it does have are the kinds of characters you have come to expect from a Grisham novel set in the south: hard drinking lawyers, corrupt cops and bad guys.<br />The plot is pretty basic. A horrible rape and murder takes place. The bad guy is apprehended and sent away for a couple of years, then he gets out and jury members start dropping over dead. The problem is the ten years in between. Grisham fills this void with his social commentary on the Vietnam War, race relations and the rest.<br />Willie, the main character and accidental newspaper editor comes of age during the time. The story moves along like a rudderless ship on a calm sea.<br />Most of us buy his books hoping to read another Rainmaker or the Firm or the Testament. <br />This book was probably an effort to write.

US	46856618	R1VTGPLFQWYZIT	0451209443	786063504	Sphere of Influence	Books	3	4	10	N	N	Average thriller at best	The Tom Clancy quote on the back cover reads, &quot;Kyle Mills is fast becoming the new master of gripping and intelligent page turners.&quot; <br />Gripping and intelligent is where the wheels start to come off on this book. The plot comes down to the threat of a rocket launcher and 3 or 4 missile s smuggled into the United States via Mexico and the vague threat that these might have biological or chemical warheads. This situation puts the public in a deep panic and the economy in a tailspin. Furthermore, the rockets and the launcher are held by separate terrorist cells, and have to come together so that they can launch a rocket with a 12 mile range at a civilian target.<br />I guess the threat isn't all that credible in my mind. Saddam proved you don't need a fancy launching platform to send SCUD missiles into Israel so why do these terrorist need one? The bad guys never pull off a strike - so why is there such a tremendous panic?<br />Secondly, the plot has a whole raft of interesting characters. You have Mark Beamon (Mills' burnt FBI agent), a Russian gangster, a CIA nincompoop, a New York wiseguy, and your stock-in-trade fanatical terrorist. There is a lot of potential here, maybe enough for a couple of books.<br />Thirdly, Beamon goes so far out on a legal limb that the ending defies belief.<br />With all that said, Mills is a talented writer. The dialogue and story moves along. I just think he needs to recognize the Mark Beamon character has run its course and move on. He has shown us that he can be brilliant, but I think he needs new material.	2004-03-22

I've noticed over the past couple of years, a spate of novels, remembrances penned by Vietnam veterans.<br />PURPLE SUN is another book that recounts through two characters (a lieutenant and a master sergeant) their lives, their duty and their impressions of contemporary Vietnam. PURPLE SUN is a story about a thrice wounded Marine, who vanishes on patrol. Did he desert? Was he killed? Did the Viet Cong capture him? Could he still be alive?<br />PURPLE SUN can be read at different levels, but what I came away from the book with was the question: What really happened to us? Did our time there make any difference?<br />I'm not sure PURPLE SUN answers those questions, but I think the book has something say.<br />At a minimum, I think it is time we listened to the men and women who served. <br />A fast, fascinating read.	2004-03-19

David Gerrold cuts thru the New Age, wimpy crap that plagues the modern TV series and delivers a book that gives the hard edge a star ship needs on the frontier where the bad guys would rather eat you than talk.<br />The book opens with the LS-1187 joining a convoy on the Silk Road. Only as soon as they join the ships, the Morthan Solidarity attacks and rips the heart out of the fleet. Commander Korie has mortally wounded captain, an untested crew and a severely damaged ship.

Based on the hype and the endorsements, I expected Mr. Rosenberg to be the next Tom Clancy. Unfrtunately, this book falls short of the mark.<br />Unlike other genres, the techno thriller/political thriller relies of careful attention to detail. Now everyone makes mistakes, but here are a number of glaring technical errors related to systems, organizations and weapons through out the book. Finally the book is set in a post Bush administration where American weapon technology would be in the next generation. For example the F22 and JSF systems would be operational. National Missile Defense would be in place, and progress on the digital battlefield more advanced - none of this was really considered in the book. <br />The plot is straight forward enough. A coordinated attack against Canada, England, Saudi Arabia and America attempts leadership decapitation. The identified culprit is Saddam Hussein and the race is on to take him out. (Memo to Mr. Rosenberg: Heavy forces cannot be moved strategically overnight.)<br />There is a subplot involving the Four Horsemen (The Four Horsemen are amongst the most feared terrorists in the world), who are tied to an iranian/Russian organization. In the post 9-11 world, I suspect there are standing orders that if you find a bad guy you nail him.  I am still trying to figure out why they decided to attack the retired MOSSAD head in Jerusalem.<br />This book does prove that you can write a bestseller without resorting to gutter language or engaging in a meaningless whirlwind romantic subplot. For that I am grateful and I wish more people would take the same tact. <br />The debate over the use of American nuclear weapons is interesting. I fail to see where it was right wing or left wing. I think it accurately reflected the ongoing debate of whether or not the United States can ever employ nuclear weapons as a first strike option. However I would point out, Presidents cannot declare war - that is a congressional perrogative.<br />If you can live with the inaccuracies, then spend an afternoon in a cozy chair.	2004-02-14

All of a sudden, it looks like the North koreans may have figured out a way to bring Spanish Lady back from past, and the good guys need to get on top of this problem before the bad guys perfect their weapon.<br />The story shifts dramatically to Frank Daly, a Washington Post reporter, who stumbles across the story and gets entangled with a far out cult. The cult's founder, Luc Solange gets most of his money from the North Koreans (why the Nkors would pick Luc and company to deliver their weapon system is never explained).<br />Eventually, Frank Daly ends up in a life or death confrontation with Luc and company armed with nothing more than the First Amendment. Perhaps, this art initating life, but I would have arrived there with nothing less than a squad of Force Recon Marines and a couple of tanks.<br />Without giving away too much, journalist Frank saves the world from destruction at the hands of the Nkors and looney cultists.<br />If you forget that Frank is kind of dumb, the story holds together pretty well and demonstrates just how vulnerable we are to BW or CW attack using our infrastructure.<br />Worth a quick read.	2004-02-09

Nick Cook delivers a book that deserves careful consideration. He follows the data and comes to incredible revelations. Perhaps, there is a way to either shield gravity or to produce an anti-gravity effect. Maybe there is more energy resting in a show box than all the oil fields and nuclear power plants dotting the globe. And what if the speed of light is not the boundary we have come to believe it is?<br />Before you discard the notion, I dare you to read the book and then go to your browser and start looking up names or places or ideas. There is a wealth of knowledge out there that is way outside the box.<br />Coupled with a tremendous scientific story are the efforts by the American government to keep much of this technology under wraps and behind closed doors. The black world (as Cook calls it) rarely meets the white world.<br />For anyone remotely interested in cutting edge technology, this is a must must read.	2004-02-09

But just about everything described in this book has happened for real since it was written.<br />First the Iranians attack the USS Makin Island with a devastating bombing that almost sinks the ship (can you say USS Cole). The United States retaliates with an attack on Iran's main oil depot at Kharg Island (cruise missiles and high technology weapons). The Iranians respond with a command attack on a major oil pumping station in the United Arab Emirates, and then go one step further. They decide it is time to take the war to the United states and target the President. A small dedicated terrorist group penetrates America and slips behind the barrier of missiles, ships and planes defending the country (it is a 9-11 style attack except with commandos).<br />Through it all defense analyse Rich Welsh suspects the truth and tries to get somebody to listen. (I suspect he has a few real life aanalogues who saw the coming storm, but whose warnings went unheeded.) The Welsh character conveys the author's feelings about structural problems that plague the Marines and the Pentagon mentality.<br />This is a well written and well paced book.

(Take a minute and puzzle out what is going on here.)<br />Subtle hint, the number 13 has a lot to do with everything, especially Teddy.<br />To discuss the plot is to ruin the plot. This is a masterful job that will have you looking for more.<br />A must read.	2004-01-03

As he has promised us, he will never write the same book twice. So one should expect a certain amount of unpredictability.<br />The initial premise of creating an Artificial Intelligence computer based not on reverse engineering the brain, but by \\"cloning\\" the human mind into a machine is fascinating. The technology described does not seem far off, so the idea seems doable.<br />I ran into problems (and I always run into problems with books that go this direction) when the main characters develop a \\"God\\" complex where they have mastered all knowledge and are all powerful. FOOTPRINTS reminds me of a 1970's movie where the computer takes over the world and no one knows how to stop the cybernetic creation. My eyes glaze over whenever a novel attempts to transcend the nature of man.<br />That said, FOOTPRINTS is well written and it does keep you reading. I just didn't buy it after a while.<br />You'll either like this one or hate it.	2004-01-02

This time the deadly omega clouds are approaching an small planet called Lookout 3000 lightyears from earth. A small survey team heads for the planet to determine whether any life exists, and at the last minute they discover a race of beings.<br />Now it is a race between human technology and the deadly omega clouds to attempt a recue of an entire planet. But 3000 light years is still a very long ways away, and it comes down to a handful of heroic people to attempt the impossible.<br />I never miss a McDevitt novel and you shouldn't either.	2003-12-26
US	46856618	R3UONA54GJSY0Q	0060009667	148654727	Tidal Rip	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Tidal thriller	This is the second novel I have read by Joe Buff (the other being CRUISH DEPTH).<br />TIDAL RIP is an extraordinarily satisfying thriller that continues the story of the Boer/Axis war against America. The situation is desperate as Europe has already falen under the new Nazi domination and the axis powers are attempting to link up in Africa. Just as in previous wars, a convoy on men and equipment is steaming across the Atlantic to shift the tide.<br />Into this mix fall two submarine commanders: Ernest Beck and Jeffry Fuller. They command the world's most advanced submarine platforms (ceramic hulled, deep diving predators). Beck's mission is to kill the convoy and possibly win the war. Fuller's mission is to kill Beck. They have the whole Atlantic in which to fight.<br />A very satisfying read. Just one caution: Once I got going, I just kept turning the pages and forgot about going to bed.	2003-12-19

WILD JUSTICE starts out on a hijacked airliner and ends up in a desperate fight to stop a master terrorist known as Caliph. <br />General Peter Stride is the Commander of Thor: A multi-national anti-terrorist squad that has some similarities to Clancy's Rainbow Six. (But before you start picking at Smith, note that WILD JUSTICE was originally published in 1979 when Iran was an American ally and no one had heard of Tom Clancy).<br />Even though the book deals with countries and places that have changed, the story has a timeless appeal characteristic of Smith's work.<br />It is great to see books like this come back into print.	2003-11-29

They have two fleets heading for each other. The Indian navy has a new weapon called Kali--a cruise missile that can be fired like a torpedoe thus hiding the attacking submarine.<br />However, a joint air force / navy group is testing an advanced underwater imaging system called Piranha. Naturally Dreamland and 3 Megafortresses are tagged to run the initial tests. WHen things heat up in the Pacific, they deploy Piranha to keep track of the opposing fleets and prevent the conflagration.<br />The story is set in 1997, and some of the technology described here might have already made its way from the drawing board to implementation. Clearly, recent events in Afghanistan and Iraq demostrate US technically superiority over everyone else.<br />This book is tightly written and real joy to read. There is absolutely nothing described here that isn't possible and that's what makes it so great.	2003-11-23

SLEEP NO MORE is a book you will either love or hate. I don't think there will be many in the middle.<br />The plot revolves around John Waters and his long dead love Mallory Chandler (or maybe she isn't as dead as she is supposed to be) or (maybe his best friend and wife are conspiring to drive him nuts) or (maybe there isn't a rational explanation).<br />This is a hard book to categorize: thriller, ghost story, horror - all of those elements exist in SLEEP No MORE, and Iles keeps stringing you along. Just when you think you've settled on a course towards the final pages, a new horrifying wrinkle comes along.<br />I found myself muttering, &quot;Oh-oh&quot; as John Waters gets sucked deeper and deeper into his nightmare.	2003-10-31

The F-15 (the mainstay of American battlefield air superiority) is no longer the top dog, and to make matters worse, its replacement is a MiG-41. Most authors would have stopped right there, but Jim Clonts takes us much further.<br />Clonts made the MiG-41 real. Obviously, he knows about military aircraft, systems and the tactics employed. He vividly paints a picture of the cockpit and takes us into combat against F-14, MiG-29, MiG-31 and a variety of ground based missile systems. <br />The story centers on two Arab countries: Sandor and Kumar, which are remarkably similar to Iran and Iraq. They are bent on developing WMD systems to direct either against each other or the rest of us. To thwart their efforts, a very black operation teams Russian and American pilots flying MiG-41s against targets in both countries. But things aren't always what they look like and not everyone has the same objective.<br />This is a great, great read. I wish I could give it 10 stars.	2003-10-25

If you need pure escape into super spy land with plenty of near escapes, explosions and a hero who knows all and can do no wrong, this isn't a bad pick up for afternoon read.<br />Mister Thor has done his research regarding the topic (although, I have some trouble believing Abu Nidal had a son no one knew about). He has a firm grasp on units and organization. However, this was a novel that reminded me of those martial arts films where people perform impossible leaps and jumps. His hero Scot Harvath seems capable of any feat - he has no weaknesses - and that isn't real.<br />When the main character stretches believability past the breaking point, then the entire story suffers. This would have been a better book if the hero was a little more human like the rest of us mortals.	2003-10-15

The Nazis have developed a secret weapon tha pinpoints their bombers and vectors fighter aircraft on thier flight paths. Unless something changes soon, the RAF will cease to be a viable military force.<br />Against this backdrop, Ken Follett takes us to occupied Denmark and fledgling resistance movement called the Nightwatchmen. Their movements are tracked by the Gestapo and their willing accomplices in the National Police. But Denmark is also the site of one of Germany's new RADAR sites and the knowledge a Danish schoolboy is vital to England's war effort.<br />Besides being a great story, Follett goes back to where he started. The characters are rich, and I immediately took a dislike to Peter Flemming (one of Follett's best villians). You find yourself cheering and crying as a desperate flight to freedom in Hornet Moth bi-plane crosses the North Sea.<br />A must read!	2003-10-08

This book doesn't have the charm and tightness found in THE JURY. Much of the first third to half of the book is setup and a number of false clues. <br />The story starts out with Mandriani's friend Nick Rush getting gunned down in a drive by shooting. For the longest time you think it has something to do with drugs, but that's really just a side issue. <br />Then there is the problem of Nick's two wives and the life insurance. Margaret is an embittered shrew and Dana a blue eyed bimbo. Either one of them could have reason to kill Nick.<br />There is Adam Tolt, who was Nick's boss and seems to have an endless supply of money and influence. While all these things are factors in the book, you don't start getting into the meat of the stoy until about page 300 and the trip to Mexico.<br />It seemed like Mr. Martini changed his mind half way through the book as to what he wanted to accomplish. While the plot is looser than his better work, the keen eye for detail and great writing is still there. His way of describing things and Harry's character have always charmed me.<br />An enjoyable, if rocky read.	2003-09-27

However, there are so many subplots that main story gets lost.

Just when things seem to be settling down into a rhythm one or both of them would go ballistic.<br />Basing a plot on government conspiracies is fine. There is plenty of material out there to work with, but this book begins with an intriguing Ludlum like premise that started to morph into somethign akin to the Fugitive then drives right over a cliff.<br />I stuck with most of the way, but finally gave up around page 300 and the upteenth inane character drama.	2003-09-13

The purpose of the Campus was to identify and deal with threats to America. This is obviously the first book in a whole new vista of Clancy books or you could say it is the Post Jack Ryan Senior world.<br />The next generation includes Jack Ryan Junior and his cousins Brian and Dominic Caruso. Through different avenues, they become part of the Campus.<br />A word about the Campus, obviously, this is Clancy's version of the ideal intel agency - one not over burdened with stifling bureacracy, meddling oversight committees and cumbersome legalities. It is a lean, mean fighting machine.<br />The familiar Jack Ryan universe still exists, and it is referenced through out the book, but this is the Next Generation with an edge.<br />The Colombian drug lords and the Islamic fanatics make a deal to help each other out. This provides a quick entry into America via the sotuhern border, where they branch out to do their worst.<br />Payback time comes due, thus the book's title.<br />A very satisfying read, and I look forward to more!	2003-08-30

While the writing is fine and pace is fast, there were a couple of things that didn't work for me. The love affair between Briggs Tanner and Camille seemed superficial and the political landscape established in the book is flawed.<br />Despite these issues, I found myself reading it to the end.	2003-08-23

For those of us who don't, the whole concept is ludicrous.<br />Quite suddenly, the world is faced with a retrovirus called SHEVA that infects pregnant woman causing them to either spontaneously abort or deliver dead babies. It is a public health crisis capable of toppling governments and rending the social fabric.<br />But wait, perhaps SHEVA isn't a virus, but spontaneous evolution (this is a theory to get around the all the missing links in the fossil record). Instead of a gradual change, the evolutionary dynamic takes place in a couple of years.<br />The human genome somehow senses (but this is never really explained) that the human race needs to change into a new species and activates SHEVA worldwide to make it happen.<br />Then there are the dreams about the last time this happened - a kind of mystical element tossed in with all the &quot;hard&quot; science used to make the book.<br />On the plus side, the characters are complex and developed. Mr. Bear envisions a world where social norms begin to breakdown (although I think the breakdown would happen faster and be more severe).<br />If you don't mind mythology dressed up as science, then this is good read.	2003-08-09

One of the cohesive elements in elite small units is the utter belief that each member of the team will look out for the others.<br />When two team members are brutally murdered in a fictional Central American jungle (Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras - take your pick), the surviving team members first protest the action through normal channels and when that fails they take the issue of honor into their own hands.<br />This is at first looks like a rogue operation that violates the chain of command; rather it is a soldier's honor demanding justice (and just is rendered).<br />The story takes a number of twists and turns as the team is hunted by the Cuban DGI, remnants of the KGB, the FBI and elements of the SOCOM. <br />You might not find this kind of justice listed in the US Code or the Uniform Code of Military Justice. But find a combat zone, and everything makes perfect sense.	2003-08-02

This book has a little of everything, a familiar and foreboding setting in the guise of the New York Museum of Natural History; the return of several characters such as Agent Pendergast, archeologist Nora Kelly and journalist William Smithback.<br />There is the elusive Enoch Leng, who seems to have figured out how to extend life, albeit, by butchering other people in order to obtain the necessary ingredients for his life extending concoction.<br />There is the cement-between-the-ears museum administration and some really dumb cops and politicians that stumble through the tale. There is also the 36 bodies found at a building site and possibly the largest mass murder in American history.<br />I have to admit I followed the false trail of clues, and missed the prime suspect, but that is part of the book. There are a good number of twists and turns, and there is Pendergast's hidden agenda.<br />Overall, an entertaining romp.	2003-07-28

This time the world faces a potential war in south America and the usual suspects are renting out their battle fleet to the highest bidder. In order to keep the American Navy at Bay, a submarine creeps into waters outside Norfolk and sinks cruise ship carrying most of the Navy's top brass. This is a crippling and devastating blow to the level of readiness.<br />There are many charcters you have grown used to in previous books and some new ones as well. The sea battles are realistic as Dimercurio moves about twenty years into the future and speculates the type of weaponry available to attack subs: Plasma warheads (a small, focused nuclear weapon, Vortex undersea missles (a super cavitating munition) and a light imaging system (much better than conventional sonar).<br />He also does something I like to do myself.

If you're Nasa, you go find an ex-astronaut turned drunken, burnt out cop and ship him up on the next shuttle mission to figure out who the bad guy is. <br />Around page 100, I really had my doubts about this book. I didn't find the main character \\"Edge\\" Reynolds particularily engaging, and I feared another \\"Nasa\\" book would get bogged down in acronym-laced prose. <br />When the murder is \\"solved\\" around page 200 and there is a good chunk of the book left to read, I decided to stick with it. Without creating a spoiler, I found the solution to the mystery rather ingenius. It was the kind of stuff the X-files had going for it in the the later seasons.<br />Considering how fragile the technology really is, I think this book's shuttle and space station are far more durable than real life, but it makes for good read on the beach.	2003-07-06

This book was a departure. I think there were too many gizmo, wizbang, gee-whiz kind of toys in this novel. The characters never really had to stretch themselves to accomplish anything, because the technology did it all for them.<br />The other thing I kept having trouble with was the character of Charlie. If he was a Marine Sniper in Vietnam and the book is set in about 2020, then Charlie would be pushing 70+ years. It just didn't hold together.<br />However, if you walk away from the need for a realistic, techno thriller and look at the book as Sci Fi, well it isn't too bad. The gadgets are kind of kool when you look at it this way, although, the characters need some work.	2003-07-06

I fully agree with everyone who complains about the lack of character development.<br />That said, we have a very intriguing concept here. It has been called Japan Inc. and the concept that business is war is taken to its logical extreme in High Flight. How separate is the Japanese government from entrenched business interests? And could there be a government behind the government that could engineer an economic attack on the United States in order to expand Japan's control over the Pacific Rim.<br />This is a very complex plot that involves baiting the Russians to strike back and the Seventh Fleet to intervene on behalf of the Japanese. Into this mix, a covert group attempts to gain control of America's domestic airline production industry and the plot involves sabotage of civilian airliners. There is a lot going on in this book, but it is well written and it continues to draw you on to the next page. Considering it is almost 900 pages long, this is a page turner that deserves to be read.<br />Whether you agree or disagree witht eh book's premise, it is worth considering.	2003-06-17

This eliminates the advantage of real time intel. <br />Washington fears that the USS Snarc (a robot submarine) has been hijacked as well and sends the Piranha to sink her.<br />If that isn't bad enough, Britain, India and Red China are squaring up for a show down in the Indian Ocean.<br />This is a fast paced, well researched and well written story. Those of you familiar with the series will see Mike Pacino's son in action and for those of us who still believe carrier battle groups are more than targets, Dimercurio provides carrier based action as well.<br />This a great read. I read most of it on a car trip on my way to Norfolk. Highly recommended.	2003-06-15

Ed Stovic, a Navy pilot on patrol in the Med is confronted with a situation when two Algerian MiG-25s try to bounce an Hawkeye Intel plane. A missile is accidently fired and the Americans respond in kind downing one MiG and sending the other running for Momma.<br />Now the brother of the dead Algerian pilot wants revenge and he goes gunning for Stovic. It turns out Stovic gets a spot on the elite Blue Anegls flight team and the ticked off Algerian (with a little help from his friends) decides the best way to avenge his brother is to shoot down the entire Blue Angel team during the prestigous Paris Air Show.<br />Kent Rathman (Rat) is a one time SEAL, now a quasi private/government agent is assigned to keep Stovic in one piece and get the Algerians.<br />The story is analogous to an old west gunfight at noon. The flying scenes and action segments are obviously where Huston is most comfortable. There is an entire subplot taking place between the National Security Advisor and the SECDEF. Personally, I would have fired the NSA. While there is a need for executive level decisions for the plot, this entire sub-plot detracted rather than added to the story.<br />A good read from an up and coming writer.	2003-06-01

He's described as a man with a Cray computer between his ears. This is a book where the answer is sitting before you the entire read, but you have to follow the clues.<br />Crone is accused of killing a beautiful, black female colleague. So does this have something to do with his research stretching back 25 years earlier about racial graying? Maybe.<br />Aaron Tash is his number 2 man, who has the personality of gum on the bottom of shoe. He meets with Crone in the county lock up and they discuss DNA codes, or maybe it is something more sinister.<br />Through out, this is Mandriani's patient manner as he discovers one lie after another - most of the coming from his client.<br />Harry Hinds, Mandriani's partner, continues to quip and wisecrack his way through the story. There is a tight symmetry that really works for the book.<br />A couple of things to keep in mind: Figure out the motive and you'll discover the murderer, and follow Mandriani's advice, &quot;Lawyer's like to keep you looking at one thing while they do another.&quot; <br />Novelists like to do the same thing. We are a sneaky bunch.	2003-05-30

Wynne takes us into the covert world of military special operations. He asks the question: What does a country do with highly trained operators in the absence of war?<br />Jonny Maxwell was considered the best. But Jonny had a problem - he liked to rape women. So Jonny goes to jail and breaks out, because that is what he was trained to do.<br />They send Jonny's partner, Dale Miller, to bring Jonny in, failing that to take Jonny out. This is an edge of your seat manhunt. A thriller that suggests SWAT teams and SOG Marshal units are not up to the task when confronting highly trained and highly organized people.<br />It is so refreshing to read a book where the author gets the guns and the action right. Wynne obviously knows what certain kinds of weapons are capable of and more importantly what they can't do. He also understands small unit and single man actions.<br />I enjoyed this book. It is a great find to discover another writer who works in this genre and knows what he is talking about.	2003-05-26

You have the evil Sauron, which are basically beetles on steroids, The Ra Na, which a furry little dwarfs and a collection of human refugees.<br />Humanity has been reduced to 3 billion souls. The only kind of religious fever that could survive in this apocalyptic world are white racists.<br />Most of the action is confined to a revolt on the rbiting fleet and what remains of Washington State. (I don't know what happened to the rest of the world, but the last time I checked there were people in Asia, Africa and Europe).<br />Of course, the bugs (as they are called) have a weakness, and the good guys manage to wipe them out.<br />There are good aliens-invade-the-earth-and mankind-wipes-them-out books, this just wasn't one of them.	2003-05-24

For me it failed.<br />Casey Jordon is hot shot criminal defense lawyer who gets a serial killer off the hook. The bad guy is Professor Lipton (as in tea) who gets his jollies carving up women and stealing their gall bladders.<br />Donald Sales is the father of one of Lipton's victims and he has basically two modes of action: suicidal and homicidal. Considering how Law Enforcement generally approaches things like this, Sales should have been locked up and the key thrown away. Instead, he's treated as a Good Ol' Boy.<br />If you know anything about guns, then you'll probably gag on the descriptions. I don't think the author got one right.<br />There is a detective named Bollinger who knows right away that Lipton is the bad guy, but fails to prove the case. Evidence might have helped.<br />There is an FBI guy name Unger who happens the run into Lipton in a high priced whore house. This is just another of the improbable plot developments that you stumble across in this book.<br />Finally, about 20 pages from the end you find out what the connection to the prologue is--pretty weak.<br />This book is a quick, mindless read for a pleasant afternoon.	2003-05-19

The Beach House fits neatly into that category. It is certainly refreshing to read something other than the ALex Cross series.<br />The Mullens family: Jack, Peter and Mack are Irish Americans living in the Hamptons - the worker bees that fix up the homes and keep the boats running.<br />Everything might have been fine, except Peter ends up dead. The local authorities say he took a swim in fifty degree water during a storm surge. His brother Jack thinks differently.<br />Jack takes on a world of privilege and power. It is the classic David and Goliath story. Except Jack tries to use the legal system instead of five smooth stones. WHen that fails he gets down and dirty.<br />There are fast women and faster billionairs romping through this tale of lust and greed. There is blackmail, murder... more murder, kidnappings and true love. There might even be something called justice.<br />A quick buzz for a lazy afternoon.	2003-05-16

The battalion HQ is called Fort Apache and everyone is really bored with their peacekeeping duties. That is until the Hungarians and Slovaks have at it.<br />Caught in the middle is a three squad Platoon humping its way across snow covered farm fields. Two Lieutenants: Reider and Dixon struggle with each other, the men and ultimately the enemy.<br />It's bloody; it's gritty. It is a tremendous story.	2003-05-14

He starts out with a piece of a body and puts together an rather intricate plot involving the Allied High Command, Russian Spies, Nazi scientists and OSS types.<br />There are a number of interesting people along the way. Tosca who works for a lot of different people and always seems to have the next clue. Diana Brack, a mysterious woman involved in the caper more than it seems. Jimmy the OSS killer type or so we think. Onions, who is Troy's boss, and a rather cryptic sort.<br />Troy spends most of the book falling in and out of bed with different ladies, stumbling about in the dark of 1944 London and getting the living snot beat out of him by different folks.<br />But the novel works of fails on the mounting bits of evidence and much of it shows up just at the right time.

We meets Thomas Brodie Culhane (everyone calls him Brodie or Captain). Brodie grew up in Eureka, joined the Marine Corps, fought in the Great War and came home to become the town's sheriff.<br />His mentor was Buck Tallman, a man right out of the old west, and we are told he was deputy for Wyatt Earp. While Buckman is a bit 2 dimensional, his presence lingers throughout the novel. <br />Then there are Eli, Isabel and Del. Without spoiling anything, it is the stuff good sagas and generation novels are made of. By the time Mr. Diehl finished introducing Brodie, I really liked the character.<br />The  novel shifts to Zeke Bannon - a hardboiled detective working for the LAPD. He begins investigating an apparent accidental death that turns out to be a homicide and the trail leads him to San Pietro (Eureka's new name) and to Brodie. You see there is something dark and sinister in Brodie's past and while you really don't want something to be wrong. Mister Diehl continues to lay a body of evidence that points to Brodie.<br />This is a very satisfying read, and it lives up to what I've come expect from this author. <br />When my son asked me: \\"What was the best thing he has written?\\" <br />I answered without missing a beat, \\"Everything.\\"	2003-04-29

Utopia is a high-tech theme park filled with cutting edge holograms, AI managed robotics, costumed entertainers and the odd terrorist or two.<br />Mister Child borrows a page from Die Hard as he leads the reader down a trail of technology theft as the only motivation, but then there is all that cold hard cash on level C.<br />The character development is exceptionally strong for Andrew Warne, his daughter Georgia and his ex-lover Sarah as they are entangled in  several different triangles through out the story. These are likable people thrust into an extraordinary circumstance.<br />The terrorists are called John Doe, Water Buffalo, Candyman and so forth. They are all specialists, mostly ex military out to hit a home run (and they don't care how many people they kill).<br />The theme park has four worlds ranging from Camelot to turn of century England to the space age Callisto. There are chills, thrills and blobs of C-4 plastique all through the park. <br />Finally, Mister Child understands the technology he is describing (whether it is the bits and bytes or a M24 sniper rifle).<br />Overall, this was a very satisfying read.	2003-04-29

Okay, so you think you're going to read a story about immortality or the attempts to get there? (Well sort of.)<br />But things start going wrong when the the driver of the DSRV attempts to kill Hal, and when they get back to the mother ship another scientist is shooting everything that moves. Okay, so there are people who don't want to live forever. <br />This book morphs from science fiction into a world wide conspiracy run first by the Russians, then the CIA and ultimately (the ever available) secret government cabal. Of course, you never really meet the the government cabal, you just read scene after scene after scene about normal looking people whacking other people.<br />This is all explained as the results of bacterial research, which has the ability to control people's actions. Even if you accept the premise, the plot and story tend to roll over the edge of a cliff. Each scene seems more incredible than the last. Perhaps, this is the intent, but somewhere along the line this book needs to reign itself in.<br />Ultimately, the good guys (an ever changing cast based on what they ate) confront the bad uys on a cruise ship. <br />I think there might be 2 or 3 good books in here, but everything was rolled into a less than satisfying novel.<br />On the plus side, the writing and dialogue keeps you reading, it just doesn't seem like it is going anywhere.	2003-04-23

I remember after reading SAINT MUDD that I was driving along the St. Paul riverbanks and thinking about the caves used by gangsters.<br />This time he takes to the Wisconsin Dells and 1960 before the great tourist descent. Once again he writes about places and weaves legend into the story.<br />The story is written in the first person from the perspective of the investigating deputy. He arrives at the scene of the wheat field murders of Maggie and Michael Butler, who have been blown away by a shotgun in a perfectly formed crop circle.<br />So is it a murder/suicide, double homicide, something more, something less? Oh and the sordid tale of illicit sex and small town gossip runs rampant through out the story. There are no saints in this novel of deceit and treachery.<br />We follow the narrative down a road of personal discovery and shocking revelation, and just when you think you've got everything mapped Thayer twists down another avenue of inquiry you hadn't even considered. To give too many details would spoil an outstanding book.<br />So if I like it so much, why not 5 stars you ask? I just wish the sex would have been less graphic. I can get the idea without all the details.	2003-04-18

This has all the ingredients of a techno-thriller: Exotic locations, credible advanced-technology, and an intriguing premise. However, as you get into the story, you find yourself immersed in debunking a modern legend (albeit, a very hi-tech and intriguing legend).<br />The NASA PODS satellite has detected an anomally on the Arctic ice pack. A top SECRET NASA team goes north to investigate and they discover something extraordinary (it would be a spoiler to tell you what). Oddly enough, a 3 man special forces team is keeping what over the NASA nerds and things aren't quite right.<br />Overlaying this story is a cut-throat political drama played out between an embattled president and a power hungry Senator who wants to be the next president. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep you guessing. Occaisionally, I found myself stopping to consider whether the plot twists made sense. Upon reflection, I could accept them.<br />The writing is tight and compelling. There is an interesting underlying debate as to the privatization of space exploration and the balance between security and information dissemination vis-a-vis NASA and the intelligence community.<br />Like all whodunits, the plot drives the action rather than the characters. Most of these character types you've seen before in other tales. There aren't many people in this book to cheer for. Most of them have something to hide or are maddeningly 1 dimensional.<br />A quick read, interesting premise and lots of good research.<br />Douglas De Bono<br />Author of ROGUE STATE	2003-04-13

An immortal race called the Avatars have maintained their grip over the rest of mankind using a technology based on magic crystals. However, a world wide calamity overtakes their empire and for 70 years they struggle maintain their grip, but time and stagnation work against them.<br />From across the sea comes an evil race called the Almecs who serve the Crystal Queen. Confronted by the people they have enslaved for centuries and an equally lethal enemy, the Avatar Empire struggles to survive.<br />Like most Gemmell novels his characters are complex, noble, and generally, not very nice. They are real people, and the strength of his books are the people he draws to play across the landscape.<br />Without giving anything away, there are few happy endings in this book, but there are tremendous portraits of courage and valor.<br />Douglas De Bono<BR>Author of ROGUE STATE	2003-04-12

For those still interested, the book falls between Patriot Games and the Hunt for Red October. To classify this novel as a techno-thriller would be an injustice. This is more of a historical thriller based around the Soviet operation to assassinate the Pope.<br />Clancy develops an intriguing back story that includes Jack Ryan, the SIS and the CIA. Along the way we get to meet a younger version of the Foleys, Admiral Greer and Bob Ritter. At first blush, this should have been a plot line that Clancy excels at--the old Soviet Union vs. the allied American/British intelligence services.<br />However, before you write it off, you need to consider what Clancy has accomplished. While the gun play and the technology aspects of his other novels does not occur, there is the cat and mouse interplay between the KGB and the CIA. This a book better compared to John le Carre's THE CONSTANT GARDENER or the TAILOR OF PANAMA. <br />Yes, we know the Pope will be shot, and Clancy (in some ways) fails to enrich the drama, but knowing the Pope will be shot and wondering why the good guys are going to fail is the other side of the novel--and it is an important side. <br />There is a wealth of history in the information brought out by a defector from inside Moscow Centre's communicatiions area. There are the historical fingers pointing at well known spy cases (both here and in England). There is triumph in this book, it just doesn't go bang and boom all the time.<br />Don't dismiss RED RABBIT, because there is a lot going on in this novel and there is a lot to think about why we spent trillions of dollars and 40 years defeating the Soviet Union.<br />Douglas De Bono...	2003-04-06

When he is not consigning people to Sergeant Becker (the Gestapo torturer) or humiliating people with his sadistic games, he worries about his wife, children and mistress.<br />Franck is a monster without conscience.

Now the geopolitical stakes continue to rise and one of these boats needs to go down for the last time.<br />The Voortrekker scores a series of successes as it marches across the Indian Coean, through the SOSUS line leading into the Pacific and onto the final confrontation under the Ross Ice Shelf.<br />Crush Depth is fast paced, well written and interesting. There is a glossary at the back of the book that covers many of the technical terms. <br />A good read. Pick it up.	2002-12-22

It follows the lives of four people wrapped up in Churchill's effort to keep Nazi Germany off-balance vis-a-vis developing atomic weapons.<br />Bonnie Toews has done her research and it comes through on every page. As she develops both characters and story, she takes us from the Spanish Civil War, Kristallnacht and the Battle of Britain into the center of the Third Reich.<br />There are portions of the story that are difficult to read and digest, but they accurately portray the absolute bankruptcy of Nazi society.<br />I truly appreciate authors who take the time to do their research and get their facts straight. Treason & Triumph also gave me a historical perspective on the entire race for the Atomic bomb that I had rarely considered--that being Great Britain's role in the entire matter.<br />An enjoyable and interesting read. Don't pass this one up.	2002-12-20

Alex Cross finds himself confronted with a murder/robbery spree that just doesn't add up. Eventually, he discovers that a new criminal (imagine that) called the Mastermind is behind this particularily gruesome rash of murders.<br />So far, so good. I mean this is what you expect from an Alex Cross novel. But how many masterminds are there in this book? Two, three or more? <br />I just did not see where the ending came from. Having read Violets are Blue first (which is the wrong order) I knew who the real bad guy was, but I don't see the foundation for this conclusion through out Rose Are Red. It almost seems like Patterson changed his mind somewhere along the way and forgot to put the clues in.<br />If you like Alex Cross, then you know what to expect. I guess that's why I keep coming back for more.	2002-11-30

Naturally, ethics fails when it meets the bottom line. Just as Jurassic Park warned us about the dangers of tampering with things not fully understood, Prey opens a world where can it be done is never balanced with should it be done. To say more would give the thrill away.<br />Prey is a truly frightening novel and I was up way past my bedtime finishing it. This one book that is a MUST MUST read!

Stacy, the main character, is suddenly widowed when her husband's murder is labeled a suicide. The finger of blame rest s firmly on Admiral Zoll and illegal bio-weapons research being conducted at Fort Detrick under his direction.<br />While we are supposed to like Stacy, I found her rude and unsympathetic. Most of the characters were 2 dimensional and occaisionally they just \\"showed up\\" without any ground work for why they were there. In many ways the book reads like a fleshed out screen play.<br />As to the plot, it revolves around prions used to target specific populations based on DNA markers. This is an intriguing idea, and certainly within the realm of possibility. A prion based bio-weapon in the wrong hands is a frightening concept, and of course, that is what happens.<br />However, the bad guys were really just bad. Character development consisted foul language, tattoos and cliche descriptions.<br />The problem was the good guys came across the same way (minus the tattoos). <br />If you have nothing better to do for an afternoon, it may be worth a look.	2002-11-26

The struggle between science and magic, good and evil comes to a fresh conclusion in the final book in The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara trilogy. <br />Of course, we know that good will triumph. To be critcal on that point is to miss the thrust of the trology entirely. The beauty of fantasy is partly in the journey each character takes toward revelation and maturation. There are the twin themes of redemptioon and forgiveness, and those themes are embraced by loyalty and love.<br />Without giving anything away, it is obvious this not the end of the Shannara books. Mr. Brooks has provided a glimpse into the world beyond this trilogy - a world yet to be explored.<br />I can hardly wait.	2002-10-05

What I loved about his writing was that his characters drove the action. You understand or suspect their motives.

The story revolves around 14,000 year old skelton that could change the pre-history in America. The plot moves along and there are plenty of suspects/bad guys/victims/crazies. <br />I guess my problem was  all the hype comparing this to Tony Hillerman - it isn't. Mr. Mitchell does not catch the pathos of a Hillerman novel, nor should he. However, he does have an engaging voice and a sense of plotting. I thought the sexual politics pushed credulity a bit far and was a bit distracting from main plot.<br />Overall, it is worth a look.	2002-09-16

It is designed to fight a nuclear war in the event the National Command Authority or the land based systems (e.g. USSTRATCOM) can not. Mr. Henrick has done his homework when it comes to painting a picture of current/near future nuclear readiness posture. He knows his systems and weapon platforms. It is nice to read something where the author took the time to get it right (or as right as one can get from non-classified sources).<br />The gist of the story is a coup d'etat initiated with leadership decapitation. Both the President and Vice President are attacked and isolated. The problem comes down to understanding who the bad guys are. Just like in Seven Days in May, the JCS is distubed by a pending treaty that would virtually dismantle the American nuclear deterrent. <br />While Mr. Henrick does an outstanding job on the nuts and bolts end of the story, I found his characters flat. I wondered at the motivation for such drastic action and I did not get the feel for what would cause American soldiers to turn their weapons on each other.<br />That said, Nightwatch does create the tension between the good guys and the bad guys - once you figure it out.	2002-09-02

This was a delightful find. The Libyan government is up to no good, planning to gas Israel and the United States. The title refers to Navy slang for the procedure used by warships under chemical and/or biological attack.<br />Commander Bill Schmidt finds himself and his crew on the firing line (in more ways than one) in an effort to thwart the Libyan attack. Without giving too much away, Washington comes up with a hair-brained scheme and Bill's crew gets the assignment to carry out orders.<br />This book is engaging, well paced and well written. Like many first novels, it goes from beginning to end without many side trips. I've added Harlow's name to my list of authors to watch.	2002-08-17

The writing style was engaging and the pace never bogged down. It certainly was better than the Rama books. In short humanity has achieved immortal status (it really is very hard to die). They discover a massive ship barreling across galactic distances. It is a derelict which they board and turn into a luxury liner.<br />Okay, so maybe you're yawning at this point, but wait. Who built this thing? Where did they go? Why did they send into deepest space? What happened? Those are the obvious questions, but there are no obvious answers. Maybe character development could have been better, but the characters did drive the action. In other words, it made sense as to the conclusions and actions they followed.<br />Of course, there is the pay off some 480 pages into the book, and I found it refreshing. It is certainly worth a few afternoons.	2002-08-15

The contrasts and stories are astounding.<br />I have read other Vietnam tales and spoken to vets about their experiences. However, Mr. Demille's account is the best one I have ever read.

Vietnam was a faraway place I had never heard of. This book brings it home. There are scenes of great heroism and tragedy. Ia Drang was one of the bloodiest battles fought by American soldiers in the post-WW II era. While the new movie starring Mel Gibson tells some of the story, there is a great deal more to be learned in the book.<br />However, the most moving part of the book comes towards the end as the lives of the wives and parents and children are impacted. They are informed by telegram that their husband, son or father is missing or killed in action. The commentaries are heart rendering.<br />Vietnam scarred my generation, and we have been treated to too many hopeless accounts. This book is different. This book tells the story of heroes. There is no shame, no bug stomping crazy people, no vulgar accounts. This is the story of men who bled, died and fought because they believed in the dream that is America. They went because they were  ordered to go. They fought because that was their job.<br />It is not pretty, but it is the truth unvarnished by political correctness. Read the book, you owe the warriors at Ia Drang that much.	2002-05-16

It takes us to post war Germany, and an intrepid lawyer (Devlin Judge) searching for his brother's murderer. The villian happens to be Erich Seyss--SS Officer who oeprated behind the lines.<br />The book could have stood very easily on the tension of Judge's desire for revenge over his brother'surder. At first glance, it looks like this is what the book is about, but Reich reveals a plot involving Patton, the SS, and German industrialists. Yes, Patton found the Germans preferrable to the Russians, and history has proven him right, but the sinister main plot of the book that unfolds is unbelievable. Just as the solutions to remedy the problem are equally unlikely.<br />Of course, there is a love story, but what has become cliche in thrillers and Hollywood adaptations, is idea that two people eyeball each other and they manage to fall madly in love with each other in a few hours or days. Yawn -- I've seen this a thousand times.<br />As to the research, Reich is dazzling in his command of post war Germany. Certainly, he has spent time understanding the character and bent of George Patton. He obviously went to the trouble of figuring what was and was not still standing in Germany during the time period, and he is correct in his description of the Russians as locusts.<br />Runner is well written, well researched, but improbable. That doesn't make it a bad book, but it leaves it in the middle of the pack.	2002-04-28

He takes us back to 1951 and Earl Swagger - Medal of Honor and Arkansas State Trooper. Along with Earl is Sam Vincent - you remember him as the fiesty lawyer in Point of Impact.<br />Together Sam and Earl uncover the secret of Thebes Penal Colony in backwoods Mississippi. Sam approaches the puzzle according to the rule of law, the rational and the logical. He desperately wants to uphold the system. Unfortunately, Thebes and the human scum that inhabits Thebes do not understand the rational. They are beyond the law.<br />They are not beyond Earl.<br />Here Hunter's true genius is displayed. Pale Horse Coming is Earl Swagger at his primal and fearsome worst. Hunter has brought Earl thru a crucible that can only end one way (I won't even intimate the details -  it is too good). Suffice it to say, Hunter brings Earl to a place that even the horrors of Iwo Jima can not compare.<br />This one ranks up there with Point of Imnpact and The Day Before Midnight. You will not be dispppointed.	2002-04-21

It is unfair to compare this novel to that masterpiece. However, it would be nice if he returned to the level that he first accomplished in Eye of the Needle and Key to Rebecca. <br />This has become what I expect from Follett - an interesting story lacking compelling characters that I could ever care about. This books follows the same unfulfilling road traveled by previous works such as the The Third Twin and the Hammer of Eden.<br />The story centers around launch of Explorer I and the possibility of Soviet sabotage. I suppose I would have been more interested if Explorer were something more than an oversized weather baloon, but the Republic would have continued had the launch failed. The story moves along through subterfuge and deceit (some of it improbable).<br />His novels have become predictable in terms of character and format and pace. If that's what you want this is a tolerable read.	2002-04-19

The plot is straight forward enough - assassinate the King and Queen of England on AMerican soil and prevent any chance of an American entry into the next war on the side of the British.<br />There is an extraordinary amount of historical detail built into the story. The lines between fiction and history are sufficiently blurred to cause one to think about the implications of what you are reading. <br />For example, one of the most thought provoking moments is the inclusion of a Texas Congressman by the name of Lyndon Johnson.

Some of his actions are reprehensible and others are the kind this country needed the USN sailed into harm's way at Midway.<br />If you like a story about the gritty toughness at sea, then this is the book for you.	2001-09-02

This was the first Wilbur Smith book I have read, but it certainly will not be the last. This was a well paced, and wonderful adventure story with just the right hint of larceny.<br />I appreciate fellow writers who know their topic, understand the sea and get the little details right. This was fun, fast romp and very enjoyable.	2001-09-02

It never showed up. This book goes on and on and on. Finally, I dozed off and awoke with something else to read.	2001-08-30

Poyer fills out his book with great detail and knowledge of the Knox Class frigate that is outstanding. The characters are memorable and interesting, and it is the characters that make this book work so well. Finally, this book is not predictable. I'm already into another Poyer book (The Gulf) and I can assure you China Sea was not a fluke.	2001-08-30

This is an interesting problem that places a crew on the surface with a broken space craft, and the only working (or maybe no longer working) space craft is on the other side of the planet. For the first time I really got to see Mars in terms of its geography. I think the characters could have used some more work. They weren't flat or anything, they were just kind of the same. This is a good read with some interesting twists towards the end.	2001-08-30

What i got was a romance novel centered around a search dog with an IQ that would rival Einstein (now I've used a dog or two in my books, but never to this extent). Anyway, if you want a romance novel with a lot of unrealistic action and improbable situations, this is the book for you.	2001-08-30

Perhaps, he strikes chord with me in that he knocks the idea of a JSF project and continues his love affair with the B-52 megafortress featured in earlier books.<br />It ius a straight forward story about people ont he sharp end of the stick taking car eo fhte bad guys (the Iranians this time). Interesting technology and good action.	2001-08-24

It is told from the perspective of survivors, and you can not help but be moved by the bravery and valor of the men involved. It is a fast read and a well written book.	2001-08-02
