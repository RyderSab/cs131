After having read Patrick Robinson's first military thriller, \\"Nimitz Class,\\" it became quite obvious that Patrick Robinson is in the same league with Bond, Clancy, Coyle and all of the other great authors of military/political thrillers!  With that in mind, I anxiously picked up \\"Kilo Class\\" and dove right in. <br /> <br />While \\"Kilo Class\\" starts similarly to other novels in the genre, kind of slow paced in the scenario setup, it quickly picks up the pace and one soon finds themselves enmeshed in a plot that is angling in from three different directions all heading towards the ultimate conclusion.   <br /> <br />En route to the ultimate conclusion, one finds that Patrick Robinson's writing with this novel is even better than it was in \\"Nimitz Class\\" as the pacing is extraordinary and the detail of the novel is exquisite while at the same time, he doesn't become mired in the details as \\"other\\" authors have a tendency to do, making it clear that Patrick Robinson is aware of the fact that the important aspect of the novel is the human story and not the tools they use... <br /> <br />The Premise: <br /> <br />Patrick Robinson, in \\"Kilo Class\\" brings back Vice Admiral Arnold Morgan as the NSA (National Security Advisor) to the President.  Just as in \\"Nimitz Class\\" this characters curmudgeon's demeanor is quite suiting to the story.  Admiral Morgan, through various means of intelligence, discovers that the Chinese purchase of ten Kilo Class Russian made submarines are about to start being delivered. <br /> <br />Given the tactical situation where the Chinese, who are already in possession of two of the ten Kilo Class submarines, cannot secure the Taiwan Straight unless they have more Kilo Class submarines which are considered to be among the most silent submarines ever made, Arnold Morgan, with Presidential authorization, sets out to ensure that the rest of the submarines are never delivered. <br /> <br />What follows from there is extraordinary military/political thriller which literally takes you around the world in Arnold Morgan's quest to destroy these submarines before they're delivered, along the way he covers the use of Navy SEALS and gripping submarine warfare... <br /> <br />I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of the genre as I'm sure they'll find it as intriguing as I did.  {ssintrepid}	2004-12-25

DeCandido's first full length novel in the Star Trek genre.  From his work in the Star Trek S.C.E. (Starfleet Corps of Engineers) e-Book series one could tell that he was going to become a major influence in the Star Trek genre which has proven quite true given his breadth of work since this, his first outstanding Star Trek The Next Generation novel. <br /> <br />DeCandido's work stands out with great flare as its originality in the story telling is quite clear, his knowledge of the Star Trek universe is extensive and most importantly, the story is extremely well balanced between pace and narrative!   <br /> <br />Pocket Books has done a great job over the last few years in bringing in authors such as Keith R.A. DeCandido who are not only authors but fans of Star Trek which, in this reader's opinion, is quite integral in the pursuit of being able to write a decent Star Trek story such as this novel.   <br /> <br />The Premise: <br /> <br />Fresh off the heels of the events depicted in Star Trek Deep Space Nine's final episode, \\"What You Leave Behind\\" where Lt. Commander Worf, after defeating the Klingon High Chancellor Gowron and giving the Chancellorship to General Martok, is then offered the opportunity to be the Federation's Ambassador to Klingon which he gladly accepts. <br /> <br />Some two hundred years ago, a mineral rich world known as taD was conquered by the Klingon Empire and its inhabitants became slaves of the Klingon Empire.  When the Klingons were mislead by the Dominion into attacking the Cardassians the people of taD, seeing a shortage in Klingons guarding their world, seized the opportunity and retook their world for their own and called upon the Federation for assistance however, the Federation could not and would not intervene due to the potential political ramifications. <br /> <br />With the end of the Dominion war came the Klingons retaking of taD and its inhabitants renewed efforts to gain protection from the Federation comes the need for Ambassador Worf who is now called into the situation to negotiate between the Klingon Empire, the Federation and taD's inhabitants... <br /> <br />I highly recommend this numbered Star Trek The Next Generation novel as you will find it to be among the best of the numbered novels and in it, a truly knowledgeable and crafty author who stands out in the genre.  {ssintrepid}	2004-12-25

While I went ahead and purchased all of his available novels I wished to get straight to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" but discovered that \\"Angels & Demons\\" was the first novel featuring Robert Langdon, the prominent main character so \\"Angels & Demons\\" automatically became a must read prior to \\"The Da Vinci Code!\\" <br /> <br />First and foremost, one discovers in this novel that Dan Brown is an exceptional author that creates an extraordinarily believable scenario that, in its breadth and scope, is quite scary.  I found this novel, from the narrative setup of the situation to the pacing which is non stop to be exceedingly intriguing, making this novel one to be voraciously read with few interruptions which gives great credit to Dan Brown's unique knowledge of the subjects and surroundings of this novel which includes symbology, the Catholic Church and the Illuminati.    <br /> <br />The Premise: <br /> <br />Harvard University Symbology Professor Robert Langdon is awoken early one morning by an extremely odd call from the Director of CERN in Switzerland and given, what he believes, is proof that the Illuminati is still in existence despite Langdon's and the rest of his colleagues beliefs that the Illuminati is a dead secret organization. <br /> <br />Given this strange evidence, Langdon hops on a flight to Europe in the world's fastest plane and is there in an hour and begins an incredible journey through Rome and a search for clues that will bring him face to face with what he believes to be the Illuminati, all in around twenty four hours, hopefully saving Vatican City and the gathered Cardinals which are there for Conclave to elect a new Pope to replace the Pope who has recently died of a massive heart attack... <br /> <br />I highly recommend this novel to any and all that are fans of the \\"thriller\\" genre as itis one that will keep you on the edge of your seat as you're working way through it to its ultimate, most satisfying conclusion.  {ssintrepid}	2004-12-25

Over the years, Susan Wright has proven herself to be an extremely reliable author in the Star Trek universe and this &quot;Dark Passions&quot; duology is no exception to that.  I found the entire story to be thoroughly intriguing, extremely well paced and the characterizations to be perfect for what one might expect of these characters in the mirror universe.<br />With this small duology, Susan Wright took the rather apropos approach of building upon the known and unknown characters in the Star Trek Deep Space Nine mirror universe episodes and created an extraordinary story that actually takes place prior to start of the series, giving her the advantage of having all of the characters to use and giving her the opportunity to create a much more original story to include killing certain characters off.  This is an extremely powerful story that involves the majority of the female characters in the current Star Trek universe, proving their &quot;mettle&quot; so to speak and using them to perfection.<br />The only true complaint I would lodge about this duology falls more into place with the decisions of those at Pocket Books than with the author and that is the fact that this &quot;novel&quot; was broken into two books.  Considering the rather standard sized text and the fact that the first book is only 232 pages and the second is 200 pages, this could've and should've been one novel instead of an obvious ploy to ply an extra $6.99 out of &quot;passionate&quot; Star Trek readers; bad on the powers that be at Pocket Books.<br />The cover art for this novel makes this and the second novel that much more intriguing considering the originality of the story.<br />The Premise:<br />As it might spoil the story a bit I won't delve too deeply into the premise of this wonderful story.  Suffice it to say, this story involves the majority of the major female characters from &quot;The Next Generation,&quot; &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot; in extremely enlightening roles carrying an extremely original story to fruition through healthy amounts of intrigue and action...<br />Overall, I highly recommend this and the second book in this small duology to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction and especially to those that thoroughly enjoyed the mirror universe episodes on Star Trek Deep Space Nine.  {ssintrepid}	2004-05-23

The first two King's Blades tales, \\"The Gilded Chain\\" and \\"Lord of the Fire Lands\\" were absolutely phenomenal stories and it only stands to reason that this third one, \\"Sky of Swords\\" would carry on that literary excellence and indeed it well does.  What makes this third novel that much more interesting is that the entire premise is in contradiction to the conclusion of the first novel \\"The Gilded Chain\\" because at the end of \\"Lord of the Fire Lands\\" King Ambrose IV is killed off some twenty years prior to when he was killed off in \\"The Gilded Chain.\\"  With superb writing skills that include well tuned pacing and characters with extraordinary depth, Dave Duncan weaves the tale of Malinda, King Ambrose IV's daughter.<br />The Premise:<br />This novel is perfect in the sense of overwhelmingly superb political/court intrigue as we follow Princess/Queen Malinda's life from the point of her marriage to Radgar that was briefly described in \\"The Gilded Chain\\" and carried out to detail in \\"Lord of the Fire Lands.\\"  Princess Malinda must now find a way to survive as she is in the precarious position of being the heir apparent behind her sickly infant sibling who is king and her [illegitimate]half brother who becomes regent based on King Ambrose IV's will...<br />What follows from there is nothing less than another stunning success in the King's Blades tales as we're treated to more incredible \\"history\\" of the King's Blades and a character in Malinda that is full of depth.<br />I highly recommend not only this third and final novel in the King's Blades tales but all three just as the author notes in the beginning of each book that they can all be read independently of each other but that would truly leave one in the loop on the overall story.  {ssintrepid}	2004-05-23

This is author Doranna Durgin's, an author who has established herself outside of Star Trek, one and only foray into the Star Trek universe so far and I would definitely have to say that it would be nice if she revisited Star Trek fiction again.  Based on the premise stated on the back of the novel, my first impression of this novel, and prior to reading it was that it would be another bland numbered novel that would find difficulty in holding my interest.<br />Upon reading it though, that first impression couldn't have been further off.  While I wouldn't class this novel as being among the tops in the numbered novel arena I would say that it was a very good novel with a very good story.  The only reason I haven't given this novel five stars is that I truly would like to have given it four and a half stars as it is very good story that is just a cut above the rest of the numbered novels but not quite in the realm of exceptional numbered novels.<br />I found Doranna Durgin's writing to be very good.  This story has very good pacing that doesn't drift off in unnecessary directions, the plot set up and execution is carried out very well and the characterizations are dead on perfect to include some humorous moments which are difficult to do in print but she does it well here.<br />The cover art for this novel is a cut above the older ones as at about this time it seems that the powers that be at Pocket Books decided to start giving a little more attention to this somewhat important aspect to the Star Trek line of novels.<br />The Premise:<br />Although it's not specifically stated, this story is placed on the Enterprise NCC-1701-D prior to the events of &quot;Star Trek Generations.&quot;  Captain Picard and crew finds themselves in another one of those precarious dilemma's as they find that in order to help the people of the planet Ntignano whose sun is going nova thanks to the intervention of extremists they must first deal with the Tsorans who control an extremely tricky space corridor that is vital to the evacuation of the Ntignano's planet.<br />The story breaks down into three subplots as Captain Picard must deal with the ruler of Tsoran in negotiations for important maps of the space corridor while Commander Riker finds that he must escort the Tsoran leaders son on a ritual hunt within the bounds of an extremely dangerous wildlife preserve that is surrounded by heavy shielding and at the same time Geordi is in the position of attempting to establish communications outside of that shielding...<br />All of which combines to make an extremely intriguing tale that is at times extraordinarily exhilarating especially along the lines of Commander Riker's sub plot.<br />I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction as it is a very good novel that fits well into the genre!  {ssintrepid}ricky space corridor that is vital to the evacuation of the Ntignano's planet.<br />The story breaks down into three subplots as Captain Picard must deal with the ruler of Tsoran in negotiations for important maps of the space corridor while Commander Riker finds that he must escort the Tsoran leaders son on a ritual hunt within the bounds of an extremely dangerous wildlife preserve that is surrounded by heavy shielding and at the same time Geordi is in the position of attempting to establish communications outside of that shielding...<br />All of which combines to make an extremely intriguing tale that is at times extraordinarily exhilarating especially along the lines of Commander Riker's sub plot.<br />I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction as it is a very good novel that fits well into the genre!  {ssintrepid}	2004-05-23

Star Trek &quot;Dark Passions&quot; book two of two is the glorious continuation of and conclusion to the first novel in this small duology that uses a majority of current Star Trek's strongest female characters from the mirror universe.  Just as in the first novel, Susan Wright's extraordinary writing skills such as exceptional pacing, thoroughly intriguing plot set up and execution and strong characterizations stand out brilliantly in this novel.<br />As stated in my review for the first novel in this small duology, the only downside to this story has nothing to do with the author as Pocket Books chose to skim their faithful readers for an extra $6.99 by breaking this story into two novels when they could've easily cut down on the pitch for the type and published this great story in one novel.<br />Just as in the first novel, the cover art is an exception to the rule for when this novel was published.<br />The Premise:<br />Book two carries the story on in which Seven (Annika Hansen) who in the mirror universe is an Obsidian Order agent, is continuing to stay close to Kira Nerys in the hopes of carrying out her mission but she is also having second thoughts about her goals in life as she is for the first time in her life thinking for herself which can and will have some serious ramifications for those she's dealing with...<br />As stated above, this is an exceptional conclusion to a wonderful story that I highly recommend to any and all fans of Star Trek fans and especially to those that thoroughly enjoyed Star Trek Deep Space Nine's mirror universe episodes just as I did.  {ssintrepid}	2004-05-23

Over the years in Star Trek novels there have been several novels that were written by multiple top Star Trek authors that either worked very well or fell flat in the dialogue and overall story, &quot;Wrath of the Prophets&quot; can definitely be counted among the ones that worked extremely well.  Of course, given the authors of this novel in Peter David, Michael Jan Friedman and Robert Greenberger, this novel should have and does work well in bringing the characters and story alive, given the feeling of a well made show.<br />One of the better things about having read so many Star Trek novels by these great authors is that you can pretty much; with a fair amount of certainty tell which parts were written by which author.  Overall, the plot setup and execution is done extremely well, the pacing of the novel is phenomenal and the characterizations are done extremely well, especially the &quot;first time&quot; pairing of Major Kira Nerys and former Starfleet officer Ro Laren.<br />The cover art for this novel, while still coveting the image of two major characters, is a pretty good one and much better than the majority of the novels that were published at the same time as this one.<br />The Premise:<br />A fatal disease starts ravaging Bajor and eventually spreads to Deep Space Nine itself.  Captain Sisko finds that he must turn to former Starfleet officer, Ro Laren in order to find the source of the alien plague.  What follows from there is an extraordinarily well written novel that involves the better part of the crew to solve to mystery as Dr. Bashir struggles to find the cure and somewhere in Dax's past one of her previous hosts has run into this virus.  The dialogue between Kira and Ro in this novel is utterly phenomenal and completely believable as to what it might've been had they met on screen.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this Star Trek Deep Space Nine novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction as it is a highly imaginative and wonderfully intriguingstory.  {ssintrepid}	2004-05-08

Star Trek &quot;Avenger&quot; is a good conclusion to William Shatner and Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens first Star Trek trilogy that spans well over a century of &quot;Star Trek&quot; time.  The first two, &quot;The Ashes of Eden&quot; and &quot;The Return&quot; were absolutely phenomenal in so much as telling a good story about Captain Kirk just before the events of Star Trek &quot;Generations&quot; and after the events of that movie with his return from the dead in &quot;The Return&quot; bringing this compelling character back to Star Trek readers if not moviegoers.<br />The one unfortunate aspect of &quot;Avenger&quot; is that while it is a very good novel it doesn't quite live up to its two predecessors.  The story in and of itself is a pretty good one, it just reaches into some areas of Star Trek that leaves one wondering where the authors were going; by that I mean in the areas where the dialogue more or less puts Captain Kirk in such a glorious light and in doing so demeaning such STNG icons as Captain Picard and Commander Riker.  That being said, the overall story is still a very good one where all three authors deftly put together a truly good story that is in good fashion in Gene Roddenberry's universe.  The pacing of the novel is exceptional and the overall plot set up and execution is well on the mark.<br />The cover art for &quot;Avenger&quot; is pretty much more of the same bland stuff that was very typical of Star Trek novels at the time of its publishing.<br />The Premise:<br />In true Star Trek style and fashion, William Shatner and the Stevens brought together a story that clearly ties up many of the loose ends set up in the first two novels and set up a reunion between Captain Kirk and Spock.  The two storied heroes eventually come together when Captain Kirk, long thought to be dead, sets out to discover the source of a lethal virus that is destroying crops all over the Federation causing famine throughout the Federation with the situation worsened by over population.  At the same time, Spock returns home to Vulcan to investigate whether his father died of natural causes or could there have been foul play involved.  Both investigations lead them into a long awaited reunion that is told extremely well...<br />What follows is an exceptionally well written novel with only few technical errors that aren't too difficult to overcome.  Overall, I would highly recommend this and the first two novels in this, the first Shatner/Stevens trilogy to any and all fans of good Star Trek fiction!  {ssintrepid}	2004-05-03

The premise of this story is a fairly good one albeit another diatribe of &quot;we're lost in the Delta Quadrant and we need supplies,&quot; which was well over done in the episodes and done way too many times in the Star Trek fiction line.  I found the author's writing to be extremely descriptive however, the pacing and the overall execution of the premise leaves the story somewhat flat and unentertaining.<br />The cover art for this novel is fairly bland which is something that the Voyager series of books was normally not afflicted with but in this case it is.<br />The Premise:<br />In this particular &quot;search&quot; for supplies; the crew of Voyager detects a planet in which they may be able to replenish their supplies however, not long after arriving they find lavish gardens and the drama kicks in when a particular flower in the garden starts causing crew members to fall into comas.  Captain Janeway, unwilling to have this afflict the crew on board Voyager must find a way to help her away team while at the same time dealing with the enigmatic inhabitants of the planet...<br />What follows from there is, as stated above, a story that in its premise is a fairly good one but in the execution of that premise it falls flat despite the exceptional narrative in setting up the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of the novel.<br />I would recommend this particular Star Trek Voyager novel to fans of the series or Star Trek in general that like to read all that's in print but I would certainly not recommend it to a first time Star Trek reader as it would ultimately leave such a reader questioning the overall quality of Star Trek fiction as a whole.  {ssintrepid}	2004-05-02

After finishing his first &quot;Tale of the King's Blades&quot; in &quot;The Gilded Chain,&quot; it seemed as though that novel would be a hard one to follow but Dave Duncan deftly handles that in writing this thoroughly absorbing and compelling story.  The only downside to this story is the beginning in which it seems to take some time for the story to get going at a decent pace but I suspect that was, for me, simply an aftereffect of having just finished &quot;The Gilded Chain&quot; and the frenetic pace at which that story concluded.  Overall though, &quot;Lord of the Fire Lands&quot; is a completely compelling story where Dave Duncan sets a good pace for the plot and tells a tale that adds brilliantly to King's Blades mythology.<br />The one truly intriguing aspect of this novel is the ending which contradicts the conclusion of &quot;The Gilded Chain.&quot;  As I understand it though, Dave Duncan cleverly handles this contradiction with ease in the third novel, &quot;Sky of Swords.&quot;  Every one of the novels begins with a blurb about how these novels can be read independently of the others but it would be &quot;best&quot; to read them in order to get the thorough experience of the overall story, which is exactly what I would suggest.  The first two tales pretty much run concurrently of each other and there are even appearances in &quot;Lord of the Fire Lands&quot; by key characters from the first novel.<br />The Premise:<br />&quot;Lord of the Fire Lands&quot; is the story of two would be Blades in Wasp and Raider.  When the time comes for King Ambrose IV to come to Ironhall and bind them into his service Raider respectfully refuses to do so and his best friend Wasp follows his lead.  In the entire of history of the King's Blades, this has never happened before.  As the two youngsters patiently await the outcome of their dreadful decision, King Ambrose comes to them and orders them to explain why they've done what they've done.<br />This is where the true story kicks in for this outstanding novel as Raider, who turns out to be Radgar, the son of the former King of the Baels, Eled.  Raider begins to tell them how he came to be in Ironhall and the tale takes of from there...<br />What follows from there is an extremely enlightening addition to the &quot;Tales of the King's Blades&quot; as Dave Duncan takes us on an adventure that spans several years where the characters are extremely well defined with exceptional depth and the overall plot is thoroughly well thought out and executed.<br />I highly recommend not only this second book in the King's Blades tales but the all of them to any and all who are fans of exceptional fantasy fiction that is written with adults in mind.  Dave Duncan is a superior author who deserves any and all accolades he's received and I'm sure continues to receive for these exceptional stories.  {ssintrepid}	2004-05-02

Given the immense popularity and overwhelming acclaim that author Diane Duane received for &quot;Dark Mirror,&quot; my anticipation for this numbered Star Trek The Next Generation novel was pretty high.  Upon reading it though, I found the book to be good but lacking in a few areas.  While Diane Duane's usual good style of writing is there where the premise is clear and executed well and the pace is steady but the characterizations are off and the overall feel of &quot;Intellivore&quot; is that much goes unsaid which is quite unfortunate.<br />The cover art for this novel is pretty much standard fare for when the novel was published.<br />The Premise:<br />In true Star Trek fashion author Diane Duane takes the Enterprise into a no win situation when several ships and colonies mysteriously disappear into a Great Rift that is outside of Federation territory.  Captain Picard leads the Enterprise and two other Federation starships to investigate this mystery and what they discover can only be described as epic in its scope...<br />What follows from there is a fairly good numbered novel in the STNG line that I would definitely recommend to any and all fans of good Star Trek fiction despite the minor faults I earlier described.  {ssintrepid}	2004-05-02

Surprisingly, this is the last Star Trek novel in any of the series written by John Peel who is an excellent author.  As with his first two novels, I found his writing to be absolutely superior in the genre, from characterizations to pacing to overall duel plot set up and execution, this novel has everything that a Star Trek novel reader would want when it comes to a desire for a good Star Trek &quot;fix.&quot;<br />The cover art is the one minor detractor for this novel and most others published at the same time as it seems that Pocket Books wasn't too concerned with putting too much effort into the cover art for Star Trek books when this one was published.<br />The Premise:<br />This novel is one of those true rarities in the world of Star Trek fiction as it carries two distinctly different plots involving the crew of the Enterprise.  On the planet Buran a mysterious disease is overwhelming the population.  As the crew of the Enterprise shows up to help, the people of Buran turn against them, leaving Dr. Crusher and Captain Picard with some hard choices in the face of opposition while trying to assist the population of Buran while at the same time, hoping to stop the people of Buran, who recently joined the Federation, from pulling out of the Federation.<br />On nearby Iomides, Commander Riker attempts to find a Federation observer that has disappeared but they know that the observer is bent on violating the Prime Directive in an attempt to prevent an assassination...<br />As stated above, this is an outstanding novel that is a cut above the rest when it comes to numbered novels.

There have been very few times over the years that I've started a Star Trek novel in any of the series and seriously entertained the idea of putting the novel down for good without finishing it but this novel fell into that rare category for me.  Not surprisingly, this is the second of only two novels in the Star Trek universe for Melissa Scott, an author that I would hope found a more suitable niche in her own or other genres.  Much to my chagrin, I found her writing to be somewhat lackadaisical in that the pacing was slow, the plot set up fairly plodding and the characterizations are off by a notch and the overall feel of the novel to be unimaginative.<br />The strange thing about Star Trek Voyager novels published at this time is that quite often the cover art is better for them while the stories weren't while novels in the other series were exactly the opposite.<br />The Premise:<br />&quot;The Garden&quot; is one more example in the Star Trek Voyager line of novels where the premise of &quot;We're lost in the Delta Quadrant and we're desperately in need of supplies&quot; was way over done!  This time around, Neelix leads the valiant crew of Voyager to the Kirse homeworld.  The Kirse are renowned for their bountiful crops and their enigmatic nature.  As timing never seemed to be on their side, Captain Janeway attempts to negotiate a trade agreement with the Kirse when the Andirrim attack the Kirse and she finds herself and her crew caught in the middle and unsure as to which side to trust...<br />What follows from there, as stated above, is a novel that in its premise alone had lots of potential but ultimately falls flat in its execution.  Despite panning this novel, I would still recommend it to other fans of Star Trek fiction but only on the basis of it being part of the &quot;line&quot; for those, like myself, who attempt to read them all.  {ssintrepid}	2004-04-27

While I enjoyed this story tremendously I wouldn't go so far as to say it was her best work in the Star Trek universe which was &quot;The Best and the Brightest.&quot;  As with every one of her novels I've read so far, her writing extremely well paced, the characterizations are dead on and the overall plot set up and execution are in good order.  <br />What truly knocks this novel back a notch for me, is that it more or less falls into the category of common place within frameworks of early Star Trek Deep Space Nine stories, either in print or on the actual television show, as this type of story was done way too often.<br />While the author probably has little to do with the cover art, Pocket Books takes another hit on the cover art for this novel as with most at the time of this novels publishing.  They just didn't seem to care too much for putting too much effort into the novels in this period.<br />The Premise:<br />A violent plasma storm rolls into the Bajoran system and Deep Space Nine suddenly finds itself over populated with people seeking refuge leaving Odo and Lieutenant Commander Worf struggling to maintain control on the station.  The more interesting aspect of this novel reveals itself in the Dax and Keiko story where they must take a runabout into the heart of the plasma storm and what they discover there...<br />What follows from there is a well written story, as with most from this author, that only suffers in that this type of story has been done way too many times in the Deep Space Nine story line.  I would still highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction for the sake of the author as I've found her stories to be among the best in the Star Trek universe.  {ssintrepid]	2004-04-27

As it so often happens during a war many people may watch specials on news shows about soldiers and how their participation in the war has affected their lives but not long after the war is over they're forgotten by the public in general.  Being a soldier myself, I know and understand what happens to soldiers during and after war and for those that were directly involved in the war itself, their experiences are not soon forgotten and for some, it takes a toll that can never be recompensed.<br />That is the story told that in this book, the story of Joseph B. George's life and his experiences prior to, during and after Desert Shield/Desert Storm.  In many ways his story is somewhat commonplace where a young man makes the decision to join the Army to both earn money for college and to carry on a family tradition of military service and then that decision makes an indelible mark on their lives, which removes the commonplace aspect making it that much more moving.<br />Joseph B. George's tale is one of a nineteen year old who enlisted in the Army to serve in the Armored Corps and not long thereafter found himself in the Big Red One, one of the Army's most storied divisions.  When Saddam Hussein made the fatal decision to invade Kuwait that led to President Bush's decision to form the coalition that ultimately removed the Iraqi's from Kuwait, the Big Red One was among the first divisions in country, there to remove them and it is among these major political events that Joseph B. George, a deservedly confident American soldier, became a true war hero, something of which many may aspire to be until the experience is upon them.<br />His tale is an extremely poignant one in which he starts with his enlistment in the Army, survives and thrives during the war and then switches gears to how his life was dramatically effected after the war all the way up to the beginning Operation Iraqi Freedom and the anguish he felt for the soldiers of a younger generation going into that situation.<br />Although some of his &quot;facts&quot; are a little off when it comes to some military equipment and when it was used and the writing is a bit disjointed, his story alone more than makes up for these editorial errors.  I highly recommend this self published story to any and all who are interested in hearing about war from a soldier's point of view!  {ssintrepid}	2004-04-26

First and foremost, Dave Duncan is an incredibly imaginative and detailed masterful storyteller within the genre of fantasy fiction for adult readers!  A few weeks ago I was searching for something different to take with me on a business trip outside the country where I knew I would have lots of time on my hands and happened to see his latest paperback out of the corner of my eye and read the back cover for it which brought me to his first book in the &quot;Tales of the King's Blades&quot; series.  Needless to say, but I will, discovering this outstanding author's work was a serious boon for me as I discovered his work to be absolutely superior!<br />Upon starting &quot;The Gilded Chain,&quot; one quickly discovers that Dave Duncan is truly a masterful storyteller in that his pacing is breakneck in speed; incredible in plot setup and execution; incredibly well detailed as he not only tells a story but sets the reader up within his newly created world of Chivial where &quot;conjurations&quot; are common and there is an overall exceptionally rich history to his story!  My only regret in beginning to read his novels is that I hadn't discovered his work earlier.<br />The cover art for &quot;The Gilded Chain&quot; is perfectly well suited to the story and does what it is intended to do, draw a reader to the novel.<br />The Premise:<br />Welcome to Dave Duncan's world of Chivial where conjurations are commonplace and the King, Ambrose the IV has at his disposal Ironhall where his personal guards are known as Blades.  From an early age, young men who have nowhere else to go, if they show some promise, are admitted to the school and given the best training in the world in the practice and art of being swordsmen!<br />As they progress in age and years at the school they either handle the training or leave at their own will.  Upon becoming the most senior of the students, Prime and Second as it is known, they come close to what they've been working towards for so long.  Whenthe time comes for the King to issue a warrant for a new Blade for either his own service or for a courtier he wishes or believes has need of a personal body guard the ward is sent to Ironhall with the warrant!<br />As the ritual goes, the ward takes the prospective Blade's newly crafted sword and through conjuration, runs it through the Blade's heart, providing the conjuration is a good one and both the Blade and the Ward's intention are good, the Blade will live and his binding to his ward is complete!  As long as that Blade lives, his pure purpose in life is to guard his ward's life with his own...<br />In comes the story of &quot;The Gilded Chain&quot; and Sir Durendal, one of the most promising Blade's to come out of Ironhall in years and one who has taken the name of Durendal as the first Durendal was an absolute hero in the Litany of Heroes at Ironhall.<br />What follows from his &quot;first&quot; binding is one of the most incredible and wonderful well told fantasy stories this reader has ever had the privilege to read as the author takes us through the life of Sir Durendal or Lord Roland as he later is able to take his given name.  From a poor child with talent taken into the bosom of Ironhall to his first and second bindings to his being released and becoming the Chancellor of Chivial to King Ambrose the IV, this tale will absolutely captivate and enthrall the reader at a breakneck speed...<br />I highly recommend this first tale in the &quot;Tales of the King's Blades&quot; and any other novel written by this superior author to any and all who enjoy good fantasy fiction that is written for adults.  Dave Duncan most certainly deserves any and all praise and accolades I'm sure he's received and continues to receive for this superior piece of fiction!  {ssintrepid}	2004-04-17

Of the several Star Trek Voyager books I've read to date, I would definitely have to put this particular trilogy at the top of any list of Voyager novels and well into the top ten of any list of top Trek novels in any series!<br />Where &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot; and &quot;Ghost Dance&quot; established the trilogy and furthered it along, &quot;Shadow of Heaven&quot; quickly takes shape in the beautiful &quot;Trek&quot; fashion of wrapping up the many strands that make up a great story!  Christie Golden's skills as a writer, in setting up a very plausible premise, carrying an exceptional pace and imbedding a highly intriguing twist or two all shine through brilliantly in this trilogy, making this third novel one that is hard to put down until you've reached the last page.<br />One extremely minor note of caution in this third novel is that there are some fairly glaring mistakes in where people are but I would highly recommend dismissing those editorial misses as I did, all in favor of the overall excellence of this exemplary tale!<br />The cover art for this third and final novel in the Dark Matters trilogy is in keeping with the other two in that they're a cut above the rest of the novels published in the same time frame.<br />The Premise:<br />Where the first novels established the premise and furthered the story, Christie Golden does an exceptional job of wrapping up the many threads of this wonderful Trek tale where we finally become privy to the rogue Shepherds plot and the good Shepherds role; the exceptional character of the Romulan chairman of the Tal Shiar, Jekri Kaleh and the conclusion of her intriguing tale; the troubles that Chakotay and Paris go through in the Shadow universe and ultimately, the trials that Captain Janeway and her remaining crew aboard Voyager must go through to conclude this extraordinary chapter in their journey home...<br/>Overall, I highly recommend this entire trilogy to any and all who are fans of great Star Trek fiction that more than capably makes up for the lack of these series airing on a weekly basis for our viewing enjoyment.  Additionally, I'd highly recommend any other novels written by Christie Golden as she is an exceptional author whose work &quot;must&quot; be acknowledged as among the best in the world of Trek fiction!  {ssintrepid}	2004-03-27

As &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot; established the premise in which the author chose the character of Romulan scientist Telek R'Mor from Star Trek Voyager's first season episode of &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; and the events of that episode and has expounded upon them beautifully in this trilogy; &quot;Ghost Dance&quot; takes the tale much further and gets into the heart of the subject.<br />The most impressive aspect of this and third novel is where the first novel established the premise of the entire trilogy, this second novel is where the true intrigue and the overall compelling nature of the story as a whole kicks in.  As I casually read the first novel, this approach was unacceptable for the second as this trilogy turned into a true page turner!<br />The cover art for this second Dark Matters novel is on par with the first novel and a cut above the rest of the novels published at that time.<br />The Premise:<br />In &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot; we learned that an individual named Lhiau who claimed to be a member of a race known as the Shepherds established contact with the Romulan Empire of twenty years in Voyager's past and that he more or less brought them an offer &quot;they couldn't refuse.&quot;  His primary contact with the Romulans was established through Jekri Kaleh, the chairman of the Tal Shiar, the Romulan's super secretive security organization.  Armed with &quot;superior&quot; cloaking technology given to them by Lhiau, they intended to open a wormhole to the Delta Quadrant and send thirteen Warbirds to seize control of the technologically advanced Voyager...<br />&quot;Ghost Dance&quot; easily picks up where &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot; left off, although there is one minor distraction which is the &quot;cleverly&quot; played retrospective of the first novel, just in case somebody decides to start this brilliant Trek trilogy with the second novel instead of the first one.<br />With &quot;Ghost Dance,&quot; Christie Golden's talents as an author shine even more brilliantly as she takes us even deeper into the political intrigue involving the Chairman of the Tal Shiar, Jekri Kaleh; an extremely well written and developed character that more or less carries the story.  Along with the exceptionally well written Jekri Kaleh parts, the author's skill in fast paced, narrative and action driven Trek fiction shine as she takes us through Captain Janeway and her crews steps in solving the many problems caused by the rogue Shepherds release of mutated Dark Matter upon their universe and the wonderfully well told sub plot of Chakotay and Paris's experiences after Chakotay dragged them through a &quot;portal&quot; to an unknown planet...<br />I highly recommend this and the other two novels in the trilogy as author Christie Golden, with this trilogy once again proved why she is one of Star Trek's premier authors.  She is truly capable of some of the most creative story telling in the world of Trek fiction!  {ssintrepid}	2004-03-27

Not unlike many, Peter Jackson's wonderfully well told cinematic version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; brought upon me a desire to return to this extraordinary trilogy and read it once again as the first and last time I read it was well over twenty years before.  There are many choices of releases in which to read this incomparable tale, from paperbacks to mass trade paperbacks to a few different types of hardbacks and then there is this, this wonderfully well crafted Leatherette Collector's Edition which does much to add to the experience that is reading Tolkien's masterpiece, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;<br />Personally, I've read a great many novels in several different genres to include the fantasy genre in which Tolkien's first masterpiece &quot;The Hobbit&quot; kindled that love of fantasy fiction and was then further fueled by reading &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; so many years ago.  In reading so many fantasy novels today, it is so clear that many of today's authors were influenced by Tolkien's style in which he wrote this novel as they almost to a number, mimic the formula for fantasy writing that he established in &quot;LOTR.&quot;<br />For overall feel and ambience, this Leatherette Collector's Edition is the most obvious choice if one is looking to read this great fantasy tale, the only true caution is that it may be a bit cost prohibitive for some but it is well worth every penny and I might add that the best price for this novel may be found here on this site!<br />The Premise:<br />By now, many know the overall premise of this extraordinary tale in which Frodo, a hobbit from the Shire in Middle Earth finds himself and his companions thrust into the matters of the world as he is suddenly the ring bearer, the one chosen to bear the ring to Mordor for its ultimate destruction and the end of the dark threat that the creator of that ring, Sauron, poses to the good peoples of Middle Earth.  Contained within these well crated pages is nothing less than the most extensive, well thought out, extravagant fantasy tale ever written that transcends the fantasy genre to become a story not of Hobbits, Men, Orcs and other creatures but a story of people and the choices they must make in the harshest of conditions and the care that they have for one another in those circumstances.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this novel and this wonderful version to any and all that wish to say that they know the true version, in all it's wonderfully glory, of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as master storyteller; J.R.R. Tolkien meant it to be.  Not to take away from the accomplishments of Peter Jackson and the rest involved in making the movies as they're truly beautifully well made movies that are a pure joy to watch but they're but a mere shadow of what is written in the pages of this outstanding novel!  {ssintrepid}g less than the most extensive, well thought out, extravagant fantasy tale ever written that transcends the fantasy genre to become a story not of Hobbits, Men, Orcs and other creatures but a story of people and the choices they must make in the harshest of conditions and the care that they have for one another in those circumstances.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this novel and this wonderful version to any and all that wish to say that they know the true version, in all it's wonderfully glory, of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as master storyteller; J.R.R.

Going back all the way to her first Star Trek Voyager novel &quot;The Murdered Sun,&quot; Christie Golden has quite well proven herself as the &quot;authority&quot; in Voyager novels as she's written several of them to include two relaunch novels that follow up with the crew after their return to Earth.<br />Among the typically more interesting Star Trek novels are those that are loosely or in whole based upon a character or two that appeared in a single episode.  This is the formula that Christie Golden chose for this trilogy in which she takes the story told in Star Trek Voyager's first season episode &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; and primarily the character of Telek R'Mor and expounds on it in beautiful fashion to create yet another great Star Trek Voyager tale.<br />The cover art for this novel is typical of Star Trek Voyager novels at the time in which it was published making it a cut above the majority.<br />The premise:<br />In Voyager's first season episode &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; Ensign Harry Kim discovers a wormhole and raises his hopes thinking that it might lead the crew of Voyager home to the Alpha quadrant.  Unfortunately, their hopes are dashed when they discover that the wormhole is ancient and way too small for Voyager to fly through.  By a stroke of &quot;luck&quot; though, a Romulan scientist is experimenting with the wormhole in the Alpha quadrant and they make contact with him only to have their hopes dashed once again when they find out that this scientist, Telek R'Mor is from twenty years in the past and that the wormhole possesses temporal qualities...<br />Jump approximately five years in the future and Christie Golden's Dark Matters trilogy begins with &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot; as the crew of Voyager find themselves running an obstacle course of multiple wormholes opening up in their path asthey're making their way home to the Alpha quadrant...  <br />What follows from there is one of the best Star Trek Voyager novels written up to its publishing date in which Christie Golden takes the character and events of &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; and weaves an extremely well told tale involving Romulan intrigue and subterfuge that rarely falls short in the compelling read category.<br />I highly recommend this novel and the following two in the trilogy to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction as this Star Trek Voyager novel written by Christie Golden is very typical of her high standard of science fiction in which she writes with excellent pacing and characterizations resulting in a highly compelling read!  {ssintrepid}	2004-03-27

When it comes to novelizations of the more popular or special episodes of any of the Star Trek series, Pocket Books usually calls on Diane Carey to cover it, as they did with this exceptional novelization.  Star Trek Deep Space Nine, Trials and Tribble-Ations is the novelization of Star Trek Deep Space Nine's fifth season episode that is Deep Space Nine's tributary episode in honor of Star Trek's thirtieth anniversary.<br />In honor of Star Trek's thirtieth anniversary the producers and writers cooked up this special episode which actually involves footage from the original series episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; and threw in the majority of the Deep Space Nine crew to make a very special episode.<br />In addition to being a wonderful novelization by Diane Carey, this novel also contains an introduction by David Gerrold, who wrote the Original Series episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles,&quot; which is extremely entertaining and informative.<br />The premise:<br />Captain Sisko finds himself being visited by members of Starfleet's DTI (Department of Temporal Investigations), which is paramount to a present day tax audit.  The purpose of their visit is to have him explain the recent time travel incident in which Captain Sisko and the crew of the Defiant found themselves in the twenty third century and staring face to face with the original USS Enterprise NCC-1701, commanded by Captain James T. Kirk himself.  <br />What follows from there is most certainly one of the more special episodes in all of the Star Trek series and an exceptional novelization by Diane Carey who quite deftly handles all of the proper aspects of writing a novelization!<br />I highly recommend this novelization to any and all Star Trek fans who enjoy the Deep Space Nine series and who just enjoy good Trek fiction!  {ssintrepid}	2004-01-26

Star Trek Voyager #10 &quot;Bless the Beasts&quot; is author Karen Haber's one and only Star Trek novel.  The end result of this novel may be the primary reason that she only visited this genre this one time.  Just as with many of the other early novels, this novel is plagued with some of the same tired plot device; Voyager's on her own and in need of supplies and repairs.  While the basic premise of Star Trek Voyager itself demands such plot devices, which were used in the episodes quite frequently and too frequently in many Voyager novels, there were many different avenues that could've been taken without consistently focusing on this one.<br />While the basic premise of &quot;Bless the Beasts&quot; was a very good one, the execution of the story was not.  The characterizations are off and the pacing of the novel unfortunately leaves much to be desired, all resulting in a novel that is fraught with unrealized potential and an unsatisfying read.  The one minor saving grace is that at far too late in the novel, it does come together for a respectable ending.  Just as with many of the other Star Trek Voyager novels from the time when this one was published, the cover art is fairly decent.<br />The premise:<br />Captain Janeway and crew find themselves once again in the position of being in desperate need of repairs and they come across a planet they find to be named Sardalia.  The inhabitants at first seem to be friendly and are living on a planet blessed with natural beauty.  It's not long before Captain Janeway finds that the hospitality being extended by the Sardalians is a bit too generous and then Lieutenant Tom Paris and Ensign Harry Kim disappear.  Captain Janeway soon finds that the situation is untenable as they discover the planet is in the midst of a planetary war and that she must face a moral dilemma...<br />What follows from there is, as stated above, a story that is fraught with potential that quickly becomes unrealized as the author takes the novel indirections that just do not capture the reader.  Overall, I would recommend the novel to only those, like myself, that are collector's/completists, not those looking for a Star Trek &quot;starter&quot; novel as this is most certainly not a novel that represents the quality possessed by a majority of the Star Trek novels.  {ssintrepid}	2004-01-26

For several years now I've been reading and enjoying Star Trek novels and have always found novels written by Michael Jan Friedman, Star Trek's most prolific author, to be among the best.  Unfortunately, &quot;Saratoga&quot; cannot be counted among those as the plot and the pacing of this novel frequently drifts.  What makes it worse is that the premise of the story is an extremely interesting one when considering it deals with some of Captain Benjamin Sisko's past along with the current timeline.<br />If this is the only Star Trek novel you've ever read by Michael Jan Friedman, who is one of Star Trek's premier authors, I urge you to not take this one as the definitive example of his writing as the majority of his novels are superior in every aspect conceivable, making them highly enjoyable reads in this genre!<br />The cover art for this title is unfortunately the same standard fare as the majority of those novels released at the same time as this one.<br />The premise:<br />Tasked with escorting the surviving members of his former USS Saratoga crew aboard the Defiant to an important ceremony, Captain Sisko finds himself dealing with the painful memories of the loss of his wife during the Borg attack at Wolf 359 and the possibility of sabotage aboard the Defiant by one of those same former crew members...<br />Overall, I would recommend this novel as it part of the line of Star Trek Deep Space Nine series, albeit a stand alone story, and the majority of these novels are well worth the read and this novel does have its place in the series.  {ssintrepid}	2004-01-23

Tolkien<br />There and Back Again told by Bilbo Baggins<br />&quot;The Hobbit or There and Back Again&quot; is, simply put, the seminal novel in modern fantasy fiction.  Although many may see &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as strictly being a children's book or at best one for the teenagers, there is much in this novel for fans of fantasy fiction of all ages.  I believe the last time I read this wondrous and beautifully crafted story was when I was a teenager myself but having been inspired by Peter Jackson telling the tale of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in the theaters I gladly purchased this novel to reread the epic and recapture the joy that it is to read one of Tolkien's classics.<br />Although many an author in many different fantasy series have come close to creating worlds such as Middle-Earth in the fantasy genre, they have done just that, come close.  Giving credit where credit is due though, a majority of these authors were inspired by Tolkien and their great works may never have been were it not for his in the beginning.<br />If you're like me, making a revisit to the world of Tolkien's writings or coming to it for the first time, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is definitely the place to start.  This review is for the Leatherette Collector's Edition, ISBN:  0-395-17711-1 which is a beautifully crafted novel and the illustrations by J.R.R. Tolkien himself all combine to make for a wonderful experience as Tolkien weaves the tale of Bilbo Baggins and his first big adventure through an extraordinary premise, exceptional plot setup and execution and perfect pacing.<br />The premise:<br />&quot;The Hobbit or There and Back Again&quot; tells the tale of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit that is visited by Gandalf the Wizard and the very next day twelve dwarves show up in his &quot;hole&quot; and enlist his aid as a &quot;burglar&quot; in their quest.<br />Before poor Bilbo knows it, he's on a quest with the twelve dwarves and Gandalf to the far reaches of Middle-Earth to rob Smaug the dragon of that which belonged to dwarf King Thorin's father Thrain and is rightfully his, the treasure of Lonely Mountain.<br />What follows from there is most certainly one of fantasy fiction's classic tales and an extremely enjoyable tale for all ages where Bilbo, Gandalf and the twelve dwarves go from one adventure to another on their way to the Lonely Mountain and an inevitable meeting with Smaug.<br />I highly recommend this novel in this Leatherette Collector's Edition to those who've never read the story before and to those that have and wish to have the best possible version of it.  It would be absolutely perfect if Peter Jackson would see fit to further immortalize this novel by bringing it to the silver screen after the overwhelming success of the &quot;The Lord of the Rings!&quot;  {ssintrepid}of Middle-Earth to rob Smaug the dragon of that which belonged to dwarf King Thorin's father Thrain and is rightfully his, the treasure of Lonely Mountain.<br />What follows from there is most certainly one of fantasy fiction's classic tales and an extremely enjoyable tale for all ages where Bilbo, Gandalf and the twelve dwarves go from one adventure to another on their way to the Lonely Mountain and an inevitable meeting with Smaug.<br />I highly recommend this novel in this Leatherette Collector's Edition to those who've never read the story before and to those that have and wish to have the best possible version of it.

As Star Trek fiction goes, this novel is a fairly decent one and this writing team has proven that they can write some fair to midland type Star Trek novels since this novel was published.<br />The overall premise proves to be a fairly interesting one, where this novel falters is in the pacing and the execution of the plot setup.  There were times within the story that the pacing was just too slow and the story somewhat stuttered, which detracted from the overall experience of the book.<br />The cover art for this novel is pretty much the same standard fare for the majority of the novels published at the time when this one was.<br />The premise:<br />Captain Picard and crew find themselves faced with Epictetus III and one of Captain Picard's toughest dilemmas' ever; the planet's star approaching nova and too few ships available to evacuate the population of over twenty million inhabitants.  As has happened many times before, Data proposes a radical new scientific experiment which &quot;may&quot; save the entire planet and its population...<br />What follows from there is an interesting story but one that is ultimately non-engaging due to &quot;quirks&quot; within the plot setup and execution thereof and the pacing.<br />I would recommend this novel as it is part of the line of all Star Trek The Next Generation novels for those that wish to read all of them but to the casual fan, this may be one to pass up on for it is not a &quot;great&quot; example of Star Trek fiction, but it is also ultimately not the worst either.  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-22

For several years now I've been purchasing and enjoying the various Star Trek calendars and have especially enjoyed the beautiful imagery displayed in the &quot;Ships of the Line&quot; calendars.  For all of the years that the &quot;Ships of the Line&quot; calendars have been published, Paramount and Andrews McMeel Publishing has had the respect to use imagery from all of the television series, that is not the case with this 2004 calendar.<br />With all due respect to the powers that be when it comes to Star Trek, the lack of just a &quot;single&quot; image from Star Trek Deep Space Nine is just another slight against Star Trek's best overall series which in this reviewer's opinion was the richest character and plot driven series to date!  One would've thought that the successful sales numbers throughout this last year on the DS9 DVD sets and Pocket Books DS9 re-launch series would've garnered DS9 some more respect, apparently not though.  I guess DS9 and its multitude of fans can and will continue to wear the &quot;red headed stepchild&quot; hat proudly!<br />Although there have been some rough spots in the Star Trek Enterprise endeavor over the last two and a half seasons, I've stuck with it just as I had with all of the other series.  Having said that, I would say that the number of images in this calendar devoted to Star Trek Enterprise suggests to me that they should've just finished it off with all of the images being from Enterprise and called it the Star Trek Enterprise calendar because this one is clearly aimed at improving that series image and hopefully increasing its viewer ship.<br />Since there is no link providing any of the images for this calendar they are as follows:<br />Strangely enough, the cover art here on Amazon is an image from Star Trek Enterprise, the calendar in my hand has some extraordinary imagery from Star Trek to include the Enterprise NCC-1701-A, an Excelsior class starship and three Klingon battle cruisers.<br />January - Star TrekEnterprise<BR>February - Star Trek<BR>March - Star Trek<BR>April - Star Trek Voyager<BR>May - Star Trek<BR>June - Star Trek Enterprise<BR>Centerfold - Star Trek Enterprise<BR>July - Star Trek Voyager<BR>August - Star Trek Enterprise<BR>September - Star Trek The Next Generation/Nemesis<BR>October - Star Trek Enterprise<BR>November - Star Trek The Next Generation<BR>December - Star Trek<br />Had I reviewed previous years &quot;Ships of the Line&quot; calendars all of them would've received a five star rating, had this one had just one image from Star Trek Deep Space Nine, it would've received a five star rating.  Overall, this is another beautiful &quot;Ships of the Line&quot; calendar but it loses one star for the slight against Captain Sisko and crew!  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-19

This books author, Jeri Taylor, started as a writer on Star Trek The Next Generation in the middle of its run and soon became one of the shows most prominent writers.  Near the end of that series, she, along with Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, became the creators, lead writers and executive producers of Star Trek Voyager, Star Trek's newest series.<br />While Voyager was received and perceived quite differently by many Star Trek fans, in my opinion, the series was a very good one despite it not living fully to its potential.  The character of Captain Kathryn Janeway is a strong and multi faceted one played to perfection by Kate Mulgrew.  The person most directly responsible for Captain Janeway's back story and overall development is Jeri Taylor, the author of this extraordinary novel.<br />&quot;Mosaic&quot; is more than just a novel in the series, it provides what Jeri Taylor described as Janeway's back story and it essentially adds up as the &quot;tapestry&quot; of her life and all of the decisions that brought her to where she was at the time this novel was published.  <br />For several years, &quot;Mosaic&quot; and Jeri Taylor's sole other Star Trek Voyager novel, &quot;Pathways&quot; were considered to be the only Star Trek novels to be canon by a majority of the fandom.  It has only been recently that that opinion has changed, for whatever reasons I'm not sure.<br />Jeri Taylor's writing style is perfect for this novel; the premise, plot setup and execution, characterizations and overall pacing of this novel makes for an excellent read in the Star Trek Voyager series.  The cover art for &quot;Mosaic&quot; is perfect for the title!<br />The premise:<br />&quot;Mosaic&quot; tells the tale of Captain Kathryn Janeway's back story through the current events in her life in which she finds herself in a quagmire where she could lose an away team and one of her best friends or lose the entire ship.  Faced with such a dire dilemma, Captain Janeway looks through the events of her life to find the solution to her current problem...<br />What follows from there, as stated above, is one of the most outstanding novels in all of the Star Trek series and most certainly one of the very few, if any, novels that &quot;could&quot; be considered canon in the Star Trek universe considering if you've read this book and watched the entire series you will see that Jeri Taylor did squeeze some of this into the shows.<br />I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek Voyager and Star Trek in general for you will most certainly find that you'll have an even better appreciation for the character of Captain Kathryn Janeway after you've read it.  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-14

As part of the thirtieth anniversary of Star Trek, the producers of Star Trek decided to honor and make tribute to the Original Series through the two series that were currently airing, Star Trek Deep Space Nine and Star Trek Voyager.  &quot;Flashback&quot; is Voyagers entry in that tributary role and plays well as such, with a story that centers on the USS Excelsior and its leader, Captain Sulu.<br />I'm quite certain that George Takei was ecstatic to get an opportunity to don the Starfleet uniform one more time as Captain Sulu and take the bridge of the Excelsior.  The show was a great show in so many ways, yet for me, the story seemed a little forced or least not as fluidic a story as it should've been.  It is with that memory of the episode in mind that I picked up the novelization.<br />As most novelizations in Star Trek are done, Diane Carey received the nod for this novel and as usual, she does an outstanding job of greatly enhancing the original story.  In this case it's the story of one of Star Trek Voyager's executive producers and most prominent writers, Brannon Braga.  With &quot;Flashback,&quot; Diane Carey's usual good pacing and between the scenes on the screen scenes, make for another good novelization.<br />The cover art for &quot;Flashback,&quot; isn't all that imaginative but it does do the casual reader some good as far as letting them know that if they pick this one up, they're going to see something very rare in a Star Trek novel, Captain's Janeway and Sulu in the same story.<br />The premise:<br />Lieutenant Tuvok, while appearing to be a young officer, in fact has lived long enough to have served aboard the USS Excelsior with Captain Sulu as her captain.  When Voyager enters a strange nebula, he starts to have &quot;problems.&quot;  Before long, these &quot;problems&quot; become life threatening and soon Captain Janeway, who considers Tuvok to be her closest friend, is there to help him...<br />What follows from there is a highly intriguing story in the Star Trek Voyager canon and I highly recommend this novelization if you wish to further your knowledge of the events that occurred during that episode.  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-14

What better title could an author have for the first original Star Trek Deep Space Nine novel with the character of Lieutenant Commander Worf?  That being said, this book does leave a lot to be desired if you, the reader, have watched the entire saga that is Star Trek Deep Space Nine.  When sitting down to read this book, one has to take the time to consider the time in which it was written and published which was well before the series as a whole thoroughly explored the Dominion and its makeup, from the Founders to the Vorta and ultimately the Jem'Hadar.  <br />Take heart in the fact that John G. Betancourt, who is an excellent author in the Star Trek genre, did not have the benefit of two to three seasons' worth of canon to work with but only a small amount of Dominion &quot;facts&quot; and a lot of speculation.<br />For making the first attempt at an original DS9 story including Worf and tackling a novel dealing primarily with the Dominion and a mission in the Gamma Quadrant, I found the overall premise to be a good one, rife with the potential to be a superior story but that potential was ultimately unrealized.  Where this novel tripped was in the execution of the plot and the characterizations which I spoke about above.  Given those considerations, the pacing of the novel suffered some as well, detracting from the experience.<br />The cover art for the novel is a bit better than the standard fare for the time in which this novel was published.<br />The premise:<br />While Captain Sisko and the rest of the crew deal with a crucial peace conference on Deep Space Nine Major Kira and Worf embark on a mission deep in the Gamma Quadrant to find the secret of the Ketracel White that the Founders use to control the Jem'Hadar.<br />What follows from there is an interesting but ultimately unsatisfying story that is contradicted in many ways by the series, which is too bad considering the effort that the author put into this novel.  I would still recommend this novel forthe basic story behind it if not for the characterizations and the &quot;suppositions&quot; about the Dominion.  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-14

Sadly enough, this novel is the second and final Star Trek novel written by W.R. Thompson which is a shame considering how well this novel and the author's first novel, &quot;Debtor's Planet&quot; were written.  It would be nice to see this author make a return to the Star Trek genre.<br />&quot;Infiltrator,&quot; from beginning to end is an extraordinarily intriguing story, written with an excellent premise, superb plot setup and execution and very fast pacing, all combining to make for an excellent read in the Star Trek genre.<br />The cover art for this novel is good, but still merely standard for the time in which this novel was published.<br />The premise:<br />As authors in the Star Trek genre are often want to do and most successfully carry out, this novel draws from the &quot;history&quot; of Star Trek by furthering the legacy of Khan Noonien Singh, the leader of the Eugenics Wars.<br />During the height of Khan's reign on Earth, several of his followers left Earth to colonize the planet Hera and continue their experiments in selective breeding.  After several centuries, the Heran's are ready to launch their plan for universal domination through genetics.  The Enterprise comes into the picture and we soon learn that a Heran expatriate named Astrid Kemal is dubiously on board.  We also soon learn that is it solely up to Captain Picard and the crew of the starship Enterprise to stop this plan before it comes to fruition.<br />As stated above, &quot;Infiltrator&quot; is one of the more intriguing and better written numbered novels to be released in the STNG line.  I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction!  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-14

As with the first book in this phenomenal series, &quot;The Genesis Wave&quot; book two is a continuation of author John Vornholt's finest work in the Star Trek genre to date.  Just as in the first exceptional novel, his visualizations, plot setup and pacing is absolutely &quot;spot on&quot; perfect, lending greatly to a very fast and enjoyable read.  Although I read a lot of books in the Star Trek genre, I can say with absolute certainty that only a select few of the titles are as gripping as this tale is.<br />Like the cover art for the first title, the cover art for this second title is absolutely perfect, greatly enhancing the story.<br />The premise:<br />In the first novel Starfleet and the Romulans found themselves dealing with the Genesis wave which was ravaging its way through the Federation, heading for Earth and then the Romulan Star Empire, prompting their help, albeit duplicitous.  As the first novel closed, Geordi LaForge, Admiral Nechayev and other key characters were on the planet Mrymidon riding through the Genesis wave and praying that their plan to save as many lives as possible would work...<br />Now, author John Vornholt takes us through the process of finding a solution to the Genesis wave and finding those responsible for its re-creation and launching.  What follows from there is nothing short of one of the most intriguing and gripping thrillers in the Star Trek genre.  Even more unusual and intriguing are the &quot;bad guys&quot; in this particular trilogy which are rather odd and original, lending greatly to the mystery of this trilogy.<br />I highly recommend this trilogy to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction as I have found these first two tales to be among the best Star Trek novels to date.  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-11

I found &quot;The Genesis Wave&quot; Book three to be a bit &quot;over the top&quot; as the far as the whole series goes.  Credibly, this story could've been finished in two novels and been done there.  I do very much respect what the author, John Vornholt, who is one of Star Trek's premier and most respected authors, was trying to do, but book three ultimately just isn't as satisfying a story as the first two were.<br />Granted, as is the case with the majority of John Vornholt's novels, the plot setup, execution and pacing were all pretty good; the overall premise just seemed to linger on a bit too long.  Although I didn't find the overall story overly thrilling, I did very much like the characters that inhabit this novel and I very much liked how they were used to further the story along.  Ultimately though, this entire novel seems to be a &quot;late,&quot; if you will, tie in to the &quot;Gemworld&quot; duology which was some of John Vornholt's best writing.<br />The cover art for this novel is somewhat intriguing but doesn't strike one as being extraordinarily well thought out.<br />The premise:<br />Simply stated, the &quot;Genesis Wave&quot; trilogy more or less concluded with the second novel.  This third novel takes an entirely different tack as Starfleet, the Romulans and everybody else that had been affected by the genesis wave and its destructive path now find themselves dealing with the consequences of the genesis wave's passing and its loosening of the thin threads between their reality and the reality of another dimension and the inhabitants of that dimension.<br />What follows from there is a somewhat intriguing tale that doesn't actually spend a lot of time with the normal heroes of a Star Trek The Next Generation novel but rather with several new and old characters.  The saving grace of this novel is those characters and how well they were written!<br />I would recommend this novel to those wishing to complete the trilogy but mostly to those, likemyself, who've set the personal goal of reading all of the Star Trek novels, good, bad or otherwise. {ssintrepid}	2003-12-11

For quite some time now I've been looking forward to getting to John Vornholt's first hardback Star Trek novels, the \\"Genesis Wave\\" series and if this first novel is any example of what the whole series is going to be like, that anticipation has been greatly satisfied.  I can say with utter certainty that out of all of John Vornholt's great trek tales, this by far has been his best and most complete story.  Complete, to a point that is, considering that this is but the first in a trilogy.<br />This first title in the \\"Genesis Wave\\" trilogy sets an even higher standard for author John Vornholt with respect to his normally great plot setup and pacing.  Book one is nothing short of a spectacular, thrilling, intriguing and enthralling ride as John Vornholt sets up the \\"impossible\\" crisis for our heroes to deal with.  Along with great pacing and plot setup another standard feature to a Vornholt novel is his visualizations.  Few authors, if any, in the Star Trek genre can describe the surrounding scenery as well as he does and it greatly enhances his stories.<br />Many authors in the Star Trek fiction genre attempt to bring guest characters into their stories and use them well, with this novel, John Vornholt has not only used those characters from shows and movies past but he has deeply engrained them into this story and given them a whole new life, which serves very well in making this novel that much better.<br />The cover art for \\"The Genesis Wave\\" book one is among the tops for the time in which this novel was published.<br />The premise:<br />During the events depicted in Star Trek II \\"The Wrath of Kahn\\" and Star Trek III \\"The Search for Spock,\\" Captain Kirk and crew dealt with the genesis device which was created by his former lover and mother of his child, Dr. Carol Marcus.  Since the conclusion of those events, Starfleet has kept Dr. Marcus hidden away for fear that her knowledge of this ultimate weapon may slip into the wrong hands.  After approximately ninety years of seclusion, she's been found and six months later the first of many planets is hit with the genesis wave, which is seemingly all but unstoppable.<br />Now, it is up to not only our heroes, Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise, they'll need help from some rather interesting guest characters that we've met in previous movies and episodes...<br />I highly recommend this first title in the \\"Genesis Wave\\" trilogy as you will most certainly neither be disappointed nor able to put the book down until you've finished and are able to move on the second and third books.  One can only hope that the second and third novels are half as good as this first one.  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-11

This great first crossover series and great first Star Trek Omnibus contains at least three out four of Star Trek fiction's best tales.  First encountered in the twenty third century by the Klingons, the Furies sent a vanguard in the form of a nearly indestructible starship where it was met by the venerable Captain James T. Kirk and the USS Enterprise.  Some one hundred years later, the Furies became an issue once again where they were dealt with by first Captain Picard and the crew of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D and concurrently by Captain Sisko and the crew of the USS Defiant in an extraordinary time sweeping tale.  The conclusion to this massive Star Trek tale is wrapped up perfectly by Captain Janeway and the crew of the USS Voyager, lost deep in the Delta Quadrant.<br />Included both with &quot;The Final Fury&quot; and this Omnibus is fantastic section titled &quot;A Word from Our Authors,&quot; where there are some great insights into what the authors were thinking when writing these novels.<br />Overall, I'd highly recommend this &quot;Invasion!&quot; series to any and all fans as, with one exception; it is a highly intriguing and epic tale that sweeps across all four series.  Listed below is the premise for each tale!<br />Star Trek #79 First Strike, Invasion #1:<br />The premise:<br />&quot;Across time and space comes a fury...!&quot;  A quote directly from the cover and yes, it is an extremely accurate and telling statement.  For many years the Federation has dealt with the Klingon Empire from either open war or cold war but never has the Federation received a call for help from them.  That is exactly what they receive and the Federation sends their very best to deal with whatever the situation may be.<br />The Klingons have found themselves dealing with a massive starship that they're unable to destroy.  Captain Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise come on the scene and discover that this ship and its leader, Vergo Zenner are but the mere vanguard of a massive invasion fleet that is headed to reclaim what they believe to be there territory since time before memory and that territory happens to encompass the Federation, Klingon Empire and the Romulan Star Empire.<br />What follows from there is an extremely interesting and intriguing tale that is also a bit rare in Star Trek fiction where it deals more with Captain Kirk as the negotiator.  Of course, when comes time to revert to the creative combat leader that he is, he steps right up to the plate.<br />Star Trek The Next Generation #41 The Soldiers of Fear Invasion #2:<br />The premise:<br />After a century of peace and no sign of the Furies, they return with a vengeance to reclaim the territory they believe is rightfully theirs.  To make matters worse for Starfleet and the rest of the Alpha quadrant, the Furies have returned with a massive fleet of even more deadly ships than the one that came a century before.  To add to that, they learned something from their first encounter and are now employing a weapon of fear upon their enemies, literally crippling them and then moving in with their physical weapons to destroy them.<br />What follows from there, as stated above, is novel that was wrought with potential that is ultimately unrealized in its execution.  I would still recommend this novel and the other three in the series as this is only a bump in the road for the series as a whole.<br />Star Trek Deep Space Nine #16 Time's Enemy Invasion #3:<br />The premise:<br />Captain Sisko, Dax and Bashir are called to Starbase One, which is at the fringe of the Terran system by Admiral Judith Hayman.  Once there she asks them to review some data chips, which they do and it doesn't take them long to discover that they're from the Defiant under his command, and these data chips describe in some detail, the destruction of the Defiant.  They soon learn that these chips were found aboard the Defiant, which had been encased in a comet in the Oort Cloud surrounding the Terran system for over five thousand years...<br />What follows from there is nothing less than one of the most spectacular and intriguing novels ever written in the Star Trek line of fiction.  I highly recommend this novel either as a stand alone in the Deep Space Nine series or as the third in the &quot;Invasion!&quot; series as it furthers that series extremely well, for it is here where we finally get some of the history of the Furies and the why behind their invasion today.<br />Star Trek Voyager #9 The Final Fury Invasion #4:<br />The premise:<br />While the battle rages on in the Alpha quadrant between its inhabitants and the invading Furies, the USS Voyager and her gallant crew are steadily making their way home when they receive a distress call from a Starfleet vessel, something of which they thought they'd never hear again.  They soon discover the source of the distress call and massive Fury invasion fleet on a constructed planetoid containing twenty seven billion Furies.  As the novel progresses, Captain Janeway finds herself in one heck of a quandary as she comes upon the realization that in order to save the Alpha quadrant, she must destroy the twenty seven billion Furies who are bent on invading the Alpha quadrant and a possible way for her ship to make it home quicker, if there is to be a home to return to...<br />What follows from there is nothing less than a impressive and decidedly compelling Star Trek Voyager novel and a brilliant finale to Star Trek fiction's first crossover series.  I highly recommend not only this novel but the entire &quot;Invasion!&quot; series, whether you procure the individual books or this fantastic &quot;Invasion!&quot; Omnibus.  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-08

After the exciting events of the first novel in this series \\"First Strike,\\" \\"The Soldiers of Fear\\" is a disappointing let down.  This is extremely rare for these two fine authors, Dean Wesley Smith and his wife, Kristine Kathryn Rusch.  It doesn't take too long to notice that the authors probably weren't given too much of a look at the first novel because several avenues opened during that book were seemingly ignored in this one.  Most telling of this tale is the rather short length of the novel, at 234 pages of large print to include a 38 page excerpt from the third book in the series, which is considerably shorter than the other three novels.<br />To add to the disappointment of this novel is the pure fact that conceptually, the premise is wrought with unrealized potential.  I'm sure that if these two fine authors were given more time and another opportunity to write this one, they would've written a much better novel.<br />The cover art for this novel is only slightly better than the rest at the time of its publishing.<br />The premise:<br />After a century of peace and no sign of the Furies, they return with a vengeance to reclaim the territory they believe is rightfully theirs.

As I've noted over the years, when Diane Carey writes novels in the original series, she's in her element more so than any of the other series.<br />The cover art for this novel is fairly creative and serves well in informing the reader of what period of Captain Kirk and crew you're dealing with.<br />The premise:<br />&quot;Across time and space comes a fury...!&quot;  A quote directly from the cover and yes, it is an extremely accurate and telling statement.  For many years the Federation has dealt with the Klingon Empire from either open war or cold war but never has the Federation received a call for help from them.  That is exactly what they receive and the Federation sends their very best to deal with whatever the situation may be.<br />The Klingons have found themselves dealing with a massive starship that they're unable to destroy.  Captain Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise come on the scene and discover that this ship and its leader, Vergo Zenner are but the mere vanguard of a massive invasion fleet that is headed to reclaim what they believe to be there territory since time before memory and that territory happens to encompass the Federation, Klingon Empire and the Romulan Star Empire.<br />What follows from there is an extremely interesting and intriguing tale that is also a bit rare in Star Trek fiction where it deals more with Captain Kirk as the negotiator.  Of course, when comes time to revert to the creative combat leader that he is, he steps right up to the plate.<br />I highly recommend not only this first book in the series but the entire &quot;Invasion!&quot; series as whole.  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-07

Imzadi Forever:<br />For those that weren't able to get these two outstanding Peter David novels in hardback, this wonderful Signature Edition would make up nicely for those missing hardbacks.  Star Trek &quot;Imzadi Forever&quot; is an assemblage of both Star Trek The Next Generation novels, &quot;Imzadi&quot; and &quot;Imzadi II Triangle.&quot;  These are two completely different stories, yet they both make for a wonderful and complete story between Deanna Troi, William Riker and Worf.<br />One of the things I've enjoyed the most about these Signature Edition novels is the introductions at the beginning of the books and the interviews with Kevin Dilmore at the back of the book, both of which have been extremely informative, giving great insight into the authors'.<br />While not canon, both of these stories play an integral part in the Star Trek The Next Generation mythos, going all the way back to the very first episode, &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; when Captain Picard attempts to introduce his first officer and his ships counselor only to find that they've already met.<br />These two stories also give great testament to the genius writer that Peter David is, who is not only a Star Trek author but a fan that gets to write these great stories.  His writing is highly intriguing, extremely humorous and extraordinarily well paced.<br />Imzadi<br />As Peter David states in the introduction, &quot;Imzadi&quot; is his homage to the TOS episode, &quot;City on the Edge of Forever.&quot;<br />The premise:<br />An older, Admiral William T. Riker that had lost his Imzadi, Deanna Troi earlier in his life when they were both serving aboard the USS Enterprise together, finds that he can no longer stand having lived his life without her and he makes his way to the Guardian of Forever to set things right...<br />What follows from there is the incredible tale in which Peter David describes in beautiful detail how a young lieutenant named William T. Riker that is seeking the stars and life aboard a starship finds himself stationed on Betazed instead and he meets Deanna Troi who becomes the love of his life.<br />Imzadi II Triangle:<br />This is one of those rare Star Trek novels which I've read twice.  Although there was a few years between readings, I felt that this story was somewhat lacking for a Peter David novel and that it merited a second reading and I'm glad I did so.  In doing so, I gained a better understanding and appreciation for this story.  Many have touted it as not being among the best of Peter David novels, I do not agree with that assessment, this story serves beautifully in telling a &quot;necessary&quot; tale in the Star Trek The Next Generation mythos.<br />The premise:<br />We first find ourselves with Worf and his dealing with the pain and anguish over the loss of his wife, Jadzia.  He then begins to reflect upon his failed engagement to Deanna Troi, a story that we never saw on screen but is dealt with perfectly in this novel.  From there the story rolls back a few years to just after the Enterprise is destroyed at Veridian III and the crew's subsequent evacuation.  Just as Commander William T. Riker decides that he can no longer be without his Imzadi, Deanna Troi, he witnesses Worf ask for her hand in marriage and she accepts.<br />What follows from there is another outstanding example of Peter David's skill as a writer as his plot setup, execution and pacing are perfect in telling the tale of how Worf and Deanna separated.<br />I highly recommend this Signature Edition novel to any and all fans of Star Trek The Next Generation and Star Trek in general as you will be hard pressed to find two better stories in the genre!  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-07

It would be nice to see John Peel make a return to Star Trek in any one of the series.  I found his premise, plot setup, execution, pacing and the overall intensity of this novel to be a wonderful addition to the Star Trek Deep Space Nine line of novels.<br />The one minor detractor is the cover art which the author has nothing to do with is the cover art, which is below the standard fare for the time in which this novel was published.<br />The premise:<br />Bajor, one of the most sacred of planets in the Alpha quadrant and also one of the planets most plagued by interlopers and usurpers such as the Cardassian occupation for sixty some years now faces one of its most deadly threats of all.  An intergalactic Hive consisting of billions of individuals, warns Bajor and its inhabitants to evacuate or risk being consumed with the planet as it makes its way for Bajor.  Given the Bajorans natural tendency towards resistance, they steadfastly stand their ground, preferring death over losing Bajor itself.  It is now up to their Emissary, Captain Benjamin Sisko to penetrate the Hive in hopes of stopping their path of destruction from heading towards Bajor...<br />What follows from there is most certainly a novel which, for its intensity alone, makes it standout among the rest of the numbered novels in the Star Trek Deep Space Nine line of novels.  I highly recommend this novel to not only fans of the DS9 novels but to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction.  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-07

The Final Fury - A great conclusion!	&quot;The Final Fury&quot; serves wonderfully as the conclusion to this first grand four book crossover series!  From his very first Star Trek novel, Deep Space Nine's #5 &quot;Fallen Heroes,&quot; Dafydd ab Hugh has proven that he can write compelling Star Trek stories and &quot;The Final Fury&quot; serves beautifully in furthering that tradition.<br />As with his other stories, I found &quot;The Final Fury&quot; to be a highly compelling and intriguing tale based on a sound premise with excellent plot setup and execution and the pacing of the novel is extremely fast making for a very quick and satisfying read!<br />The cover art for this novel is nothing extraordinary, which, sadly enough is more the standard for the time in which this novel was published.<br />The premise:<br />While the battle rages on in the Alpha quadrant between its inhabitants and the invading Furies, the USS Voyager and her gallant crew are steadily making their way home when they receive a distress call from a Starfleet vessel, something of which they thought they'd never hear again.  They soon discover the source of the distress call and massive Fury invasion fleet on a constructed planetoid containing twenty seven billion Furies.  As the novel progresses, Captain Janeway finds herself in one heck of a quandary as she comes upon the realization that in order to save the Alpha quadrant, she must destroy the twenty seven billion Furies who are bent on invading the Alpha quadrant and a possible way for her ship to make it home quicker, if there is to be a home to return to...<br />What follows from there is nothing less than a impressive and decidedly compelling Star Trek Voyager novel and a brilliant finale to Star Trek fiction's first crossover series.  I highly recommend not only this novel but the entire &quot;Invasion!&quot; series, whether you procure the individual books or the &quot;Invasion!&quot;  Omnibus.  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-07

Oddly enough, out of all of the Star Trek stories that J.M. Dillard has written this is the only original Star Trek story of hers that I've read so far.  For several years I chose to skip over the original series stories where she's written most of her original stories, something of which I corrected a couple years ago.  <br />I found this story to be, while not extraordinarily original in theme, well told with an excellent premise, plot setup and execution and, in combination with Kathleen O'Malley's writing, an extremely well paced novel that borders on the horror genre, which is rather different but enjoyable for the Star Trek genre.  Of special note is these authors characterization for Deanna Troi, which was dead on accurate.<br />The cover art is just a cut above the standard fare for the time in which this novel was published.<br />The premise:<br />Some eighty years ago on the planet Vulcan, bodiless entities plagued the Vulcans bringing a wave of violence and bloodshed, something of which had been unheard of on that planet for more than a millennia.  These entities were finally trapped inside special containers.  In the present day twenty fourth century, during a scientific exposition, the containers have been opened, freeing these entities that immediately start possessing whoever they run across, to include the crew of the USS Enterprise.  As the majority of the crew becomes possessed it is up to Data to save the day and recapture these entities before they're able to spread throughout the Federation.<br />I highly recommend this numbered STNG novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction for it is a true gem among the numbered novels.  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-07

Time's Enemy - Absolutely brilliant!	&quot;Time's Enemy&quot; is, quite easily and hands down the best Star Trek novel written by the LA Graf writing team of Julia Ecklar and Karen Rose Cercone that I've ever read.  Quite often, I've found myself having problems with their novels.  That is not the case with &quot;Time's Enemy,&quot; as it is an extraordinarily intriguing and overly enthralling novel from cover to cover.  The entire premise, plot setup, execution and overall theme behind &quot;Time's Enemy&quot; make for an excellent read and third novel in this first crossover series in Star Trek fiction!<br />It is exactly this novel that makes me continue to pick up new LA Graf Star Trek novels with their pen name on it, in hopes of finding another one of their stories that reaches the glory and potential that &quot;Time's Enemy&quot; does.<br />The cover art for this novel is nothing extraordinary and is, somewhat behind the time as it has Captain Sisko with hair, considering that he only had the hair for one or two shows after his promotion.<br />The premise:<br />Captain Sisko, Dax and Bashir are called to Starbase One, which is at the fringe of the Terran system by Admiral Judith Hayman.  Once there she asks them to review some data chips, which they do and it doesn't take them long to discover that they're from the Defiant under his command, and these data chips describe in some detail, the destruction of the Defiant.  They soon learn that these chips were found aboard the Defiant, which had been encased in a comet in the Oort Cloud surrounding the Terran system for over five thousand years...<br />What follows from there is nothing less than one of the most spectacular and intriguing novels ever written in the Star Trek line of fiction.  I highly recommend this novel either as a stand alone in the Deep Space Nine series or as the third in the &quot;Invasion!&quot; series as it furthers that series extremely well, for it is here where we finally get some of the history of the Furies and the whybehind their invasion today.  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-07

Lewitt's one and only Star Trek novel.  This novel fits well with the early Star Trek Voyager novels as the author may have had only twenty to thirty or so episodes to watch before writing it.  The premise is an interesting one and if I remember correctly, was similarly explored in a later episode.  While having an interesting premise, the plot setup, execution, characterizations and pacing are all off, leaving the reader longing for a better novel.  It would be interesting to see this author make a return to the genre and hopefully a much better effort.<br />Strangely enough, while the actual story is somewhat lacking, the cover art for &quot;Cybersong&quot; is much better than the standard fare for the time in which this novel was published, as was the case with most Voyager novels.<br />The premise:<br />Having been forced to strand the remaining crew of both her vessel, Voyager and the Maquis crew from Chakotay's ship, some two years previously in the Delta Quadrant; Captain Janeway and her crew often find themselves drawn to any possibilities of a quicker trip home.  Such a possibility suddenly arises when the ships sensors pick up a mysterious signal which leads them to believe that it is from the Caretaker's long lost mate.  Instead, Voyager and her gallant crew find, what they believe to be, a deserted ship.  Although the ship initially appears to be deserted, a strange presence casts a spell over the crew.  Unless Captain Janeway can break this spell, she may very well lose Voyager and her entire crew to this strange vessel...<br />While this novel cannot be counted among the best, I would still recommend it as one of the early Voyager novels to any collector/completists like myself who are compelled to &quot;read them all.&quot;  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-07

Star Trek's most prolific author, Michael Jan Friedman, in &quot;Kahless&quot; takes on the task of telling the tale of Kahless the Unforgettable which is a story that, while unfortunately is was not explored thoroughly in either The Next Generation or Deep Space Nine, needed to be told!<br />While Star Trek The Next Generation and the character of Worf did a great amount in furthering our knowledge of the Klingons and their culture, with Worf making the move over to Star Trek Deep Space Nine at the beginning of the fourth season did so much more in furthering that knowledge but it also brought up some serious contradictions.  As this novel was probably finished somewhere around February of 1996 and Deep Space Nines fourth season started only a short time before that, there are definitely &quot;some&quot; contradictions, but they're minor.<br />As is usual with a Michael Jan Friedman novel, the premise, plot setup, execution and pacing are all extremely well done in this novel, the only detractor being some of the fight scenes which aren't played out to the author's usual high standard.  The cover art for this novel is pretty good for the time in which it was published.<br />The Star Trek History:<br />For those that may not be entirely familiar with the story of Kahless the Unforgettable and how his character came into play during Star Trek The Next Generation's run on television.  Late in the fifth season of STNG, one of the most intriguing and telling episodes of the series aired, &quot;Rightful Heir.&quot;  In this episode, Worf had recently lost his faith after his experience on Carraya IV and finds himself not performing his duties very well.  He chooses to take leave to go to the Klingon monastery on Boreth, the Klingon spiritual world to seek Kahless.  As legend described, as he lay dying, Kahless promised his return and pointed to the star in which Boreth revolves.<br />After several days of seeking Kahless, Worf becomes even more despondent when Kahless doesn't appear to him.  As he is about to give up, Kahless comes to him, not in a vision but in flesh and blood.  After much political intrigue, Kahless is discovered to be a clone when Gowron, Chancellor of the Klingon Empire, easily defeats him in hand to hand combat.  Through great lengths on Worf's part and in an effort to save the flailing empire, Gowron allows the Kahless clone to take the ceremonial role of Emperor of the Klingon Empire.<br />STNG Kahless - The premise:<br />The Klingon Empire and its culture is one that steeped in legend and tradition.  Much of that tradition of honor is placed in the tales of Kahless the Unforgettable who is in essence the one Klingon that their religion is based upon.  When the monks on Boreth cloned Kahless, they gave him all of this myth and legend as memories of his own.  With these memories, Kahless the clone now sits upon the ceremonial thrown of the Klingon Empire, leading the empire spiritually.<br />A recent archaeological dig uncovered a scroll, presumably written by Kahless himself.  This scroll, once made public, puts everything the Klingons believe in into to question as it is blasphemous to every tale ever told about Kahless.  As the dissent starts to mount, Kahless the clone discovers a plot against him and, seeing treachery everywhere in the empire, he seeks the aid of Captain Picard and Lieutenant Worf.<br />What follows from there is a well told story in which Michael Jan Friedman takes us back and forth between the &quot;Modern&quot; age and the &quot;Heroic&quot; age, weaving the tale and plight of the Kahless of legend and the Kahless of today.<br />I highly recommend this novel as it serves well to further the story of Kahless the Unforgettable; it is essentially a story in the Star Trek mythos that &quot;needed&quot; to be told!  {ssintrepid}doesn't appear to him.

McGraw.  While I found the premise of this story to be a very interesting one, the plot setup, execution and pacing to be somewhat troubling, detracting from the experience of the book.  The saving grace for this novel is the authors' characterizations which were pretty good.<br />The cover art for this novel is pretty much the standard fare for when it was published, somewhat bland.<br />The premise:<br />While making an attempt to plus up the ships supply of deuterium, Voyager encounters a brown dwarf star, causing a great amount of damage.  Chakotay starts having &quot;visions&quot; and believes they're linked to one of the planets in the Drenar system where they encountered the brown dwarf.<br />They soon discover that many of them are having visions and since the engines are in need of repair that will take several days, they decided to explore Drenar Four and discover a primitive civilization and their plight, severe volcanic stresses.  The question of violating the Prime Directive comes immediately into play.  An alien ship soon enters the picture, the Televek and they offer aid to both Voyager and the planets inhabitants but Captain Janeway finds their offer questionable and she soon finds herself in a quagmire...<br />While &quot;Ghost of a Chance&quot; isn't among the top Star Trek Voyager books available I would still recommend it as an interesting read in the series.  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-06

This opinion is quite apparently a shared one considering that out of all of the Star Trek novels I've read and reviewed so far, &quot;The Return&quot; has the distinction of having the most reviews on Amazon that I've seen for a Star Trek novel so far.<br />From the very beginning of this novel to the end, you will find yourself enthralled and captivated by the story.  William Shatner, quite obviously did not want himself to be completely torn away from the Star Trek universe and with this novel, his resurrection in the twenty fourth century, he quite literally guaranteed himself a continued and long life after the events in Star Trek &quot;Generations,&quot; where we may never see the great Captain Kirk on screen again.<br />Although I'd say for us, the average reader, we may never know where the line of distinction is drawn between William Shatner's writing and his collaborators, Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens.  In the end though, I've noticed that while their books are very good on their own, when combined with William Shatner, their stories seem to come alive.  The premise, plot setup and overall pacing for this novel are all nothing less than stunning.<br />The cover art for &quot;The Return&quot; is quite exciting; I especially like the quote on the cover, &quot;Legends never die...&quot;  I distinctly remember when seeing the cover for this novel for the first time, being excited that James Tiberius Kirk would be making some kind of return after being lost at the end of &quot;Generations.&quot;<br />The premise:<br />Simply put, Captain James Tiberius Kirk will always find a way to cheat death!  After the extraordinary events depicted in his first &quot;Shatnerverse&quot; novel, &quot;The Ashes of Eden,&quot; and his disappearance, return and then eventual &quot;death&quot; at the end of &quot;Generations,&quot; there would simply &quot;have&quot; to be a way for him to Return...<br />As Spock stood upon a rocky crag over the raised mound of rocks which entombed his life long friend, he heard a battle going on in the distance and not long thereafter, he heard the distinct sound of a transporter and saw the raised mound of rock crumble in upon itself.  In that moment, he knew that in some way or another, his friend had once again cheated death...<br />What follows from there is, as stated above, nothing less than one of the most spectacular, intriguing and enthralling thrill rides of a Star Trek novel to have been written to date.  Throw in Starfleet, the Borg, the Romulans and a very healthy dose of inventiveness and you've got Star Trek &quot;The Return&quot; by William Shatner and the husband and wife writing team of Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens.<br />As an additional note, the audio tape version of this novel is just as wonderful as the actual novel, albeit a much shortened version.  William Shatner does an outstanding job of reading it.  He apparently didn't know how to pronounce Cardassians though.<br />I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction!  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-03

This exceptional novel was written by John Vornholt who, over the years, has proven himself to be one of the most consistently wonderful authors in the Star Trek genre.  As with any of his other previous novels, &quot;Rogue Saucer&quot; once again reaffirms John Vornholt's extraordinary writing skills, from the exciting premise and the plot setup and execution to the fast pace, this novel scores in all areas.<br />As was standard for the time in which this novel was published, the cover art for &quot;Rogue Saucer&quot; is somewhat lackluster but it doesn't detract from the experience of the novel.<br />The premise:<br />This novel has some obvious influence from Star Trek &quot;Generations,&quot; but it is placed shortly after the events in the seventh season's &quot;Preemptive Strike.&quot;<br />The Enterprise's saucer section is put in &quot;dry dock&quot; for some needed repairs and the crew of the Enterprise is given the opportunity to test an experimental saucer, marrying it up with the primary hull.  Before the command crew of the Enterprise, aboard the experimental saucer section, can get hooked up with the engineering hull, it is hijacked by the Maquis, in hopes of hijacking the primary hull of the Enterprise and using her against the Cardassians in the DMZ.<br />What follows from there is, as stated above, one of the best numbered novels in the STNG novel line.  I truly enjoy how John Vornholt can bring in guest characters and use them so well, such as he did with this novel and Admiral Nechayev.<br />I highly recommend this and any other John Vornholt Star Trek novel as you will most certainly find in your hands, some of the best Star Trek fiction available!  {ssintrepid}	2003-12-01

Even more than usual with one of her stories, I found myself amazed with how well designed the plot and overall premise of this story was setup and executed.  As is usual with one of her better stories, the characterizations and pacing for this incredible early DS9 tale are beyond reproach.<br />The cover art for this great story and the story itself aren't quite in synch, which only goes to reproving some of the difficulties the fiction writers had when trying to keep up with the fast paced series and its constant shifting and changing.  The cover art itself isn't all that interesting, but the fact that it shows Sisko as he was during the early seasons, with hair and the rank of Commander is in direct contradiction with the story where he's a Captain.<br />The premise:<br />As was usual for O'Brien during the early years of the series, he and Odo are exploring through some of the less traveled areas of the space station and they soon discover a cache of Cardassians.  The Cardassians come back to life and start causing major problems for the Starfleet and Bajoran crews.  Finding the situation untenable, Captain Sisko attempts to handle the situation diplomatically, but soon finds that impossible.<br />What follows from there is most certainly one of Diane Carey's best Trek stories and one of the best early Star Trek Deep Space Nine stories that I would highly recommend to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction!  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-30

Some where between the third and fourth seasons of this incredible series, Paramount told the shows producers to come up with a new character that would add greatly to the series.  In an incredible move, the shows producers were able to come up with Michael Dorn and the venerable character of Lieutenant Commander Worf.  Now that they had this absolutely great character they had to come up with a very credible way to bring him into the fold, hence the magnificent fourth season opener, &quot;The Way of the Warrior.&quot;<br />Author, Diane Carey, given the task of novelizing Ira Steven Behr and Robert Hewitt Wolfe's manuscript for &quot;The Way of the Warrior,&quot; does an outstanding job of doing exactly what novelizations are designed to do; she quite laudably writes the scenes that we saw on the screen, throws in some great &quot;between the scenes&quot; scenes and captures the characters feelings extraordinarily well, all wrapped up in a well paced novelization that was a true joy to read!<br />The cover art for &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot; is a slight cut above the rest of the novels that were being published at that time.  While it still relies upon placing character images on the cover, the addition of the Klingon battle cruiser and the Defiant is pretty good.  Overall, it lets the casual reader know that Worf is now involved with Deep Space Nine.<br />The premise:<br />Captain Sisko finds himself dealing with Gowron, Chancellor of the Klingon Council and General Martok, both leading a large force of Klingon ships and hanging around Deep Space Nine for reasons unknown to him.  Faced with this force and unable to get any answers, he calls for Lieutenant Commander Worf in order to discover what the Klingons are there for.<br />Not unlike Captain Sisko when he first came to Deep Space Nine, Worf is facing the dilemma of having lost the Enterprise and his faith and he's thinking of leaving Starfleet, but he accepts Captain Sisko's mission and sets out to find out why the Klingons are there...<br />What follows from there is one of Diane Carey's best novelizations of one of the best episodes in the Star Trek canon.  I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction!  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-30

From this very first novel of hers I found her plot framing, characterizations, pacing and overall writing style to be very enjoyable.  Few of the authors during this early period in Star Trek Voyager's run captured the characters as well as Christie Golden does with this novel.  Given that continued talent and several other titles in the Voyager series, she was later honored with the opportunity to write the inaugural novels in the Voyager relaunch series, &quot;Homecoming&quot; and &quot;The Farther Shore.&quot;<br />The cover art for &quot;The Murdered Sun&quot; is pretty much standard fare for Voyager at the time, if not below standard.<br />The premise:<br />Voyager's sensors indicate a possible wormhole nearby and Captain Janeway is more than eager to investigate, hoping against hope to find a quicker way for her wayward starship to get home.  Instead of finding the wormhole, Janeway and crew happen upon the Akerians who are a warlike race and are taking siege to Veruna Four.  In order to get to the wormhole, Janeway finds that not only must she protect the innocent inhabitants of Veruna Four but she must risk direct confrontation with the Akerians.<br />What follows from there is, as stated above, one of the best early Star Trek Voyager numbered novels that is well worth taking the time to read.  I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-30

I found this first solo novel of John G. Betancourt's to be a quick and interesting read.  Although there might have been some grammatical errors in the novel, they were minor and inconsequential.  One of the first things you'll notice in this story is the authors writing style, which is very good, lending heavily to a well paced novel.  I did find his characterizations to be a bit off, but that is to be expected given the time in which this novel was written and published, with approximately only a years worth of episodes to work off of.<br />In good keeping with Voyager novels of the time, the cover art is a slight cut above the other titles being published at that time.<br />The premise:<br />Voyager stumbles upon a distress signal from a shuttle and follows it to a nearly deserted system known as Arbuk.  Once there they discover what is essentially a doomsday machine that is considerably more powerful than a starship.  They also soon discover a rather interesting alien who is a Sperian.  Captain Janeway and the crew of Voyager soon find themselves under attack by an alien fleet bent on taking possession of the weapon and they must find a way to keep it out of their hands...<br />What follows from there is, as stated above, a quick and interesting early Star Trek Voyager novel that is well worth the time to read.  I recommend this title to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-30

It is quite interesting to note that in the recent release of Greg Cox's \\"The Q Continuum,\\" with an interview between Greg Cox and Kevin Dilmore that this outstanding STNG novel wasn't a collaborated effort between Kij Johnson and Greg Cox but more of a re-write on Greg Cox's part.  Apparently, Kij Johnson was only able to get the first draft in on time due to her changing jobs.  Pocket Books and John Ordover asked Greg Cox to step in and write the second and final draft.  While the excellent premise and characters belonged solely to Kij Johnson, the credit for the exceptional characterizations and pacing goes to Greg Cox for this wonderful STNG story.<br />While the cover art for this STNG novel is pretty much standard fare for the time in which it was published, the art is a cut above the rest.<br />The premise:<br />The Enterprise is en route to Pai, the throne world of the Dragon Empire in order to secure the insular empires entrance into the United Federation of Planets.  In order for the entrance of the Dragon Empire to happen, Captain Picard and crew must ensure the wedding of the Emperor's son to the only daughter of their oldest enemy goes off without any problems, effectively putting an end to decades of civil war.<br />This great story takes a turn for the worse when Dr. Crusher who has a very prominent role in the story, wins the confidence of the bride to be and discovers that she is reluctant to carry out the wedding.  Adding to that, a vicious alien race comes into the story and they will stop at nothing to prevent the Dragon Empires entrance into the United Federation of Planets...<br />What follows from there is nothing short of one of the best numbered Star Trek The Next Generation novels that both authors deserve a great amount of praise for bringing to print.  I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction!  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-30

Over the years, the husband and wife writing team of Dean Wesley Smith and Kristine Kathryn Rusch have turned out some of the best, most intriguing and enlightening Star Trek tales in the genre and &quot;The Long Night&quot; is no exception to that proven track record.  As is standard with their novels, the plot set up and execution is perfect and the pacing of the novel is fast.<br />The cover art for &quot;The Long Night&quot; is somewhat standard for the time in which the novel is published, leaving much to be desired.<br />The premise:<br />Centuries ago, the Supreme Ruler of Jibet fled a democratic uprising taking with him many priceless works of art.  Quark, being the good Ferengi that he is, hears of the whereabouts of this treasure and ends up leading Sisko and crew to not only the treasure but the Supreme Ruler himself, in cryogenic suspension.  This discovery keenly sparks the interests of Jibet itself and they send a fleet to Deep Space Nine.  Dr. Bashir struggles to keep the ruler alive and Jake and Nog discover even deadlier evidence of Cardassian involvement.<br />What follows from there is one of the best Trek novels written by these authors and most certainly one of the best numbered Deep Space Nine novels to date that I highly recommend to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-30

Captain Hikaru Sulu took the opportunity to capitalize on his character becoming the captain of the USS Excelsior in &quot;Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country.&quot;  Star Trek &quot;Envoy&quot; a Captain Sulu adventure is one of those ventures.<br />Overall, the entire premise of the story and the all out production for this audio CD is well worth the price and the time.  The only downside to the entire adventure is that in its attempt to create a realistic atmosphere, they use alien language in the background while Sulu listens to the universal translator.  Thankfully, this isn't used too often in any of the episodes because it provides a major distraction to what's important, the story.<br />While it has been the rare L.A. Graf story that I've been enthralled with over the years, this story is quite good for this writing team.<br />The premise:<br />Captain Sulu is ordered away from the Excelsior in a shuttle craft on a mission to act as the Federation's envoy between two warring races, the Krikiki and the Den-Kai.  Captain Sulu finds himself in a grave moral dilemma as he is to deliver a young Krikiki prince over to Den-Kai as a peace offering, but that prince will have to undergo isolation and physical mutilation.<br />What follows from there is a fairly interesting story that I would recommend to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction as it makes for a great hour or so while driving down the highway.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-30

As is usual with one of her stories, she throws in a feminine touch that brings about a subtle and very poignant atmosphere to the story.  As is also usual with one of her outstanding stories, her plot setup and pacing is perfect, making for a quick and highly enjoyable read.<br />This cover art for this third title in the SCE series serves well in continuing to show the readers the characters that largely populate the series.<br />The premise:<br />A strange and rather resilient ship crash lands on a planet in a highly populated area, fortunately for the residents there was enough warning time for the entire population to evacuate the area.  Starfleet gets the call and the USS da Vinci is called in to render her services.  Once on the scene, an away team is sent to the ship where they soon discover a dead alien in the command seat, 110 is rebuffed by the computer system and the ship, thought to be disabled, comes back to life...<br />What follows from there is a very poignant page turner that once again reaffirms Christie Golden's status as one of Star Trek's premier authors.  I highly recommend this title to any and all fans of not just the SCE series but Star Trek in general.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-23

As furtherance to the Excalibur trilogy, this novel serves very well.  Just as it is with all of his novels, his writing style and pacing is perfect to the subject, making for a very quick and highly enjoyable read.<br />The cover art for \\"Renaissance\\" is beautiful and it, for the first time, gives us a decent drawing of Zak Kebron.  The true oddity is whose images are on the cover of this book.  The story behind \\"Requiem\\" involved Soleta, McHenry and Kebron, the main characters in \\"Renaissance\\" are Burgoyne, Selar, Morgan Primus and Robin Lefler.  Either way, the cover art for this title is exceptional.<br />The premise:<br />Just as the first book in the series, \\"Requiem\\" tells the tale of Soleta, McHenry and Kebron and Si Cwan and Kalinda, after the loss of Excalibur, \\"Renaissance\\" now tells the tale of Burgoyne and Selar and Robin Lefler and Morgan Primus.<br />The first plot of \\"Renaissance\\" entails the highly intriguing tale of Burgoyne and Selar and the strife they're going through concerning the parental rights of their son Xyon who was named after the \\"now dead\\" Captain Calhoun's son, Xyon.<br />The second plot of \\"Renaissance\\" carries the story of Morgan Primus and her daughter Robin Lefler who take a vacation to Risa and their meeting some \\"intriguing\\" characters there.<br />Overall, I've truly enjoyed how Peter David has broken down the first two books in the Excalibur series into extremely intriguing tales concerning all of the characters and what they're going through after the loss of Excalibur and the \\"loss\\" of their Captain.  What makes these first two stories even more enjoyable are the \\"guest\\" characters that become deeply engrained in the story and the tie to another Star Trek series of novels that reveals itself.<br />I highly recommend not only this title, but the entire Star Trek New Frontier series for you will find within the pages of these novels some of the most refreshing, hilarious, intriguing and poignant stories available in the Star Trek genre.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-20

With the beginning of the Excalibur trilogy in Star Trek New Frontier #9 \\"Requiem,\\" Peter David, one of Star Trek's premier authors, has once again proven why this series is as popular as it is.  As is usual with his Star Trek novels, \\"Requiem\\" is a humorous yet serious story that I found to be a very quick read, all due to the author's excellent writing style, which lends heavily to a fast paced story.  Simply put, Peter David knows what Star Trek is all about and in the case of the New Frontier stories; it's very much about the quirky but terribly interesting crew and their personal stories.<br />The cover art is excellent, just as the cover art for all of the New Frontier books have been.  The only oddity would be Zak Kebron, giving the multiple descriptions of him, every time he's on a cover, they just don't seem to match.<br />The premise:<br />After the shocking conclusion of Star Trek New Frontier #8 \\"Dark Allies\\" in which the conclusion revolved around the Excalibur blowing up all around its crew, \\"Requiem\\" raises even more questions.  Captain Mackenzie Calhoun is now \\"dead\\" and Excalibur is gone.  The crew are all on a \\"cool down\\" period, awaiting new assignments.  After a very interesting meeting between the command crew, on Earth at a bar called \\"Strange New Worlds,\\" everybody goes their separate ways.<br />Here is where the story starts taking place.  \\"Requiem\\" revolves around three extraordinarily interesting stories.  Leading the way is the story of Soleta and her trip home to visit with her \\"father,\\" which soon segues into a very introspective tale in which she must track down her true father, a Romulan who had raped her mother.<br />Mark McHenry and Zak Kebron soon find themselves on a mission given to Kebron by Admiral Nechayev where they must go to a backwater, pre warp planet to stop some Federation college students from harassing the locals.  This story quickly turns into an extremely intriguing one given the \\"guest\\" appearance and a subtle revelation about McHenry.<br />Si Cwan and Kalinda embark on their own tale as Kalinda is still having visions from her time in \\"The Quite Place\\" and she \\"witnesses\\" the murder of a friend of Si Cwan's and they head off to find the murderer.<br />I very much enjoy the way Peter David wrote this novel and his decision to tell some very good stories about each character, broken down into this trilogy.  I highly recommend not only \\"Requiem\\" or the Excalibur trilogy, but the entire series as you will soon find that Star Trek The New Frontier is the most refreshing and exciting story telling in the Star Trek genre at this time.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-20

Overall, I'd say that Peter David set this trilogy up perfectly, with the first two books covering the crew and everything they went through after the destruction of Excalibur and this last, exceptionally outstanding novel &quot;Restoration,&quot; covering mostly Shelby and her command of Exeter and what happened to Captain Calhoun.<br />The one thing I never truly expected in the New Frontier series was a western which is exactly what you get in Captain Calhoun's story and it is written very well, reminding one of days gone by reading Louis L'Amour classics.  Shelby's story is just as interesting as you see her going through some angst during her first command.<br />As is usual with Peter David's writing, &quot;Restoration&quot; is another fine example of some the best writing in the Star Trek universe from one of Star Trek's finest authors.  You'll find that this novel is a quick read given the high level of intrigue, humor and overall feel of the novel.<br />The cover art is among the best in the New Frontier series.  What's most interesting about this novel, both in the hardback and paperback versions is the Star Trek New Frontier Minipedia which covers all of the significant and not so significant people, places, and events from the very first New Frontier novel to &quot;Restoration.&quot;<br />The premise:<br />During the first two books of this series we were lead to believe that Captain Calhoun sacrificed himself in an incredible attempt to get everybody off of Excalibur as it was in the middle of a warp core breach.  What would the New Frontier series be without its brazen captain though and we soon find out what happened.<br />Captain Mackenzie Calhoun finds himself stranded on a pre warp planet and no way to communicate with Starfleet and in the middle of great &quot;western&quot; style story.  He soon finds himself living with Rheela who has a very special gift and her son Moke.<br />Captain Elizabeth Shelby is now in command of Exeter and on a mission to invite a new planet into the United Federation of Planets but they soon find that this may not be as easy as it was originally thought it would be.<br />Here's where Peter David's superior talents as an author strike you, when he ties in the first two novels and ties in this trilogy with another series of Star Trek novels and throughout this series he brings in some great &quot;guest&quot; characters.<br />Not only do I highly recommend this New Frontier Excalibur trilogy but I highly recommend the entire Star Trek New Frontier series.  You will be hard pressed to find such fresh, innovative, intriguing and humorous stories within the other series.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-20

Of all of her novels, I've always enjoyed her writing style which is well paced and structured and &quot;Violations&quot; possesses those same qualities.<br />Given how early this novel was written during the series run on television, one can tell that the author probably only had the series &quot;bible&quot; and some episodes to base her characterizations off of and I found them to be fairly accurate and in synch with the characters during the first season.<br />The cover art for &quot;Violations&quot; is fairly decent, although the image of B'Elanna is a bit off.<br />The premise:<br />A group of aliens' volunteers to help Voyager but once they're on the ship, they steal the main computer.  Forced to negotiate with the aliens to get the main computer back, Janeway soon finds that she's dealing with a consortium of planets where thievery is an acceptable way of life.  As Janeway and the crew fight to retrieve the ever important main computer before the barely functioning ship ceases to function at all, they become embroiled in a political struggle that could not only cost them the ship but their lives as well.<br />Overall, this is a fairly well written title for the time in which it was written and given the authors lack of a couple years of experience with the show.  I would definitely recommend this early Star Trek Voyager title and any others written by this author.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-09

Of the three Star Trek titles that this outstanding author has written, unfortunately &quot;The Last Stand&quot; is the only of his I've read so far and something that I should correct soon.  I found his writing style to be very fast paced and his characterizations to be quite accurate.  Where so many Star Trek authors have attempted to go and failed, Brad Ferguson deftly ingrained a healthy amount of mystery, suspense, intrigue and humor into this novel which begs the question as to why this was his last novel in the Star Trek universe.<br />Although the cover art is quite the standard bland imagery that was normal for the time in which this novel was published, the caricatures are accurate.<br />The premise:<br />While on a routine mapping mission, Captain Picard and crew discover a culture that is just on the verge of developing warp technology, which piques everybody's interest.  Just as they begin to survey the planet and its culture, an armada approaches the planet, bent on destroying this burgeoning race.  With limited time, Captain Picard must resolve this conflict which has gone on for a millennia or face the loss of billions on the planet, yet at the same time, should he succeed he may unleash a new threat upon the Federation.<br />I highly recommend this numbered Star Trek The Next Generation novel as it is extraordinarily well written and a true pleasure to read.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-09

Unlike his first novel, &quot;Ragnarok&quot; had some pacing problems and the story appeared to drift on occasion.  The overall premise to the book is a good one; it just wasn't executed very well.  <br />For those that may be attempting to read this book after watching the series, they need to keep in mind that the plot behind this book preceded some of the episodes in which Voyager had to attempt to get through two warring factions to get home.<br />One of the things I like the most about the early Star Trek Voyager novels is the cover art and this one is no exception, unfortunately the story just didn't click.<br />The premise:<br />Reminiscent of episodes that followed this novel, Captain Janeway and the valiant crew of Voyager detects a signal that could lead them to a quicker way home, unfortunately, in order to get to that signal; they must make their way through an extraordinarily violent conflict.<br />Although the plot to this early Voyager novel was an interesting one, it was poorly executed.  This novel may have been one of those where the publisher requested the story and the author had little other than the shows &quot;bible&quot; and but a few episodes to familiarize him with the characters which would explain the poor characterizations.<br />I would only recommend this title in a collectors/completists sense.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-09

It is of little wonder as to why this was the one and only Star Trek title by this author, given the extremely poor characterizations and structure of this novel.  &quot;The Laertian Gamble&quot; most certainly must be one of the titles that the publisher requested from the author and he had only the series &quot;bible&quot; and &quot;maybe&quot; an episode or two to watch.  This is certainly one of those Star Trek novels that had me wondering why in the world I was reading it in the first place.<br />I've read novels that the basic plot required several chapters but with this novel it reaches the point of ridiculous quite quickly, 273 pages and 73 chapters, my goodness.<br />The cover art matches the novel quite perfectly, poorly thought out.<br />The premise:<br />A mysterious alien woman from the planet Laertes convinces Dr. Bashir to gamble for her at Quark's bar and he accedes thinking it innocent enough.  To everyone's surprise though, the more he wins, the more things go wrong throughout the Federation; in comes the &quot;Complexity Theory.&quot;<br />When Julian attempts to stop, a Laertian fleet appears and forces him to continue.  Kira and Dax find that they must go to the planet Laertes themselves to attempt to stop this madness but they soon find that they must battle through chaos and danger in order to save Deep Space Nine and the Federation itself.<br />The plot behind this one is a bit ridiculous and would've probably worked out a little better if it were written outside of the Star Trek genre.  Overall, I would only recommend this as a collectors/completists purchase.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-09

Strangely enough, this was the last Star Trek title released by this author.  This is especially disconcerting when taking into consideration that Gene DeWeese could write such an outstanding novel that entails Data's cat Spot becoming the hero of the novel!  I found the author's writing style to be very fast paced and highly intriguing, lending to a very quick read.<br />The cover art for this novel is pretty much standard fare for the time in which it was published.<br />The premise:<br />The Enterprise encounters a strange nebular dust while exploring an unknown region of space.  Within this nebular cloud they discover a planet called Krantin, where &quot;all&quot; life on the planet is dying.  After a series of explosions and a ship disappearing into thin air, Captain Picard and crew begin to believe there is another group that is behind the destruction.<br />The leader of the planet believes the Enterprise and her crew are behind the plot against them and has the away team arrested.  As time is running out Data and believe it or not, Spot must find a way to save their crewmates and the planet.<br />This is a highly intriguing and fun STNG novel to read and I highly recommend it to all fans of the Star Trek fiction genre.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-08

That is certainly not the case with this novel, as I believe Pocket Books and Paramount gave the authors the proper amount of time to get to know the characters from the episodes as opposed to only asking them to write a story based off of the bible written for the series.  That patience pays off quite well in &quot;The Escape.&quot;<br />&quot;The Escape&quot; is also only the second Star Trek novel for this extraordinary writing team and, as always, I found their writing styles to be quite intriguing and very fast paced.  They just don't seem to get bogged down in the details as some authors do.  This novel is well worth the time to read it based on the characterizations alone, which are extraordinarily accurate to the series and the characters at the time this novel was published.<br />The cover art for this novel can be counted among the best of any of the Star Trek novels at the time this novel was released, it's nice to see &quot;some&quot; thought actually being given to that aspect in Star Trek fiction.<br />The premise:<br />Captain Janeway finds that her ship is in desperate trouble.  Voyager's systems are damaged and the warp engines are failing, without immediate repairs, the valiant but troubled crew could find themselves stranded between the stars, open to attack from the local hostile races.  Janeway leads her ship to an ancient, deserted planet in hopes of repairing their ship and restoring their supply stores, but they soon find that the planet is hiding more than one deadly secret...<br />I highly recommend this early Star Trek Voyager novel as it is a true rarity among the first few Voyager novels and it makes for an excellent Star Trek read!  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-02

To date, &quot;The Ashes of Eden&quot; remains one of my favorite and most memorable reads in The Original Series Star Trek universe.  This extraordinary novel serves well in what I'm gathering was William Shatner's desire to stay connected with the universe he helped create.  I found this novel and it's follow up novel, &quot;The Return&quot; to both have been extraordinarily brilliant in the way William Shatner and his collaborators, Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens were able to perpetuate Captain James T. Kirk in the Star Trek universe, despite the character having been killed off in Star Trek Generations.<br />Although some of William Shatner's later Star Trek novels in the ongoing story do not quite live up to this first one, I would have to say that he's carved himself a nice niche in the Star Trek universe, at least in the fictional sense.<br />The cover art for this novel is brilliant and exciting, lending very well to the story!<br />The premise:<br />It is six months prior to that fateful day in which the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-B is launched under Captain John Harriman and she heads off for her inexorable brush with a destiny that entails the loss of the Federations most renowned captains, James Tiberius Kirk.  <br />Captain Kirk finds himself facing the spectre of an unchallenging retirement when suddenly, a very beautiful young woman makes him an offer he couldn't refuse; a perilous voyage to an uncharted planet where he will confront that which poses a very real threat to the burgeoning peace between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.  Along the way, he has the opportunity to recapture his youth.<br />Captain Kirk finds that he must turn his back on his closest friends and is that he's also being hunted by Captain Sulu and the USS Excelsior.  He also finds that he must stand alone as the chief defender of an incredibly beautiful world and he must choose between conquering the gravest challenge of his career or surrendering to the greatest passionhe's ever known.<br />I highly recommend this novel and those Shatnerverse novels that follow for you will find that this incredible writing team of William Shatner and Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens are capable of producing some the most memorable Star Trek fiction ever put to print.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-02

It would definitely be nice to see this author make a return to the Trek universe someday!<br />The cover art is pretty much standard fare for the time in which this novel was published, nothing special.<br />The premise:<br />The Enterprise is temporarily assigned to the planet K'Trall which has just come out from under the yoke of barbarous suppression.  Captain Picard and crew soon find that they must deal with a pirate ship of a sort that has been attacking Federation shipping.  This intriguing ship just happens to be an old Constitution class starship equipped with a cloaking device.  Along with dealing with the rogue ship, Captain Picard must also deal with the Romulans.<br />The planet itself holds a deadly secret as well and Captain Picard soon finds that he not only has Federation shipping to protect but millions of lives on the planet as well.<br />I highly recommend this numbered STNG title as you will find it to be one of the best published at that time and it's truly good, fast paced and intriguing Star Trek fiction.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-02
US	52712162	R32POBXVEI03OX	0671879979	263658182	The Romulan Stratagem (Star Trek The Next Generation, No 35)	Books	5	2	3	N	N	STNG #35 The Romulan Stratagem - A fantastic novel!	&quot;The Romulan Stratagem&quot; is author Robert Greenberger's first solo Star Trek novel and if you read the author's notes at the beginning of the book, you'll see that it was a labor of love for him to write this novel and it paid off extremely well.  What I find surprising about this novel is that it was released as a paperback because I truly believe it had earned a hardback release.<br />I found Robert Greenberger's writing style to be extraordinarily well paced and his knowledge of Star Trek in general shows on the pages, his characterizations are &quot;spot on&quot; and his usage of guest characters in the story is beyond reproach.  I especially liked his usage of Ensign Ro Laren, one of STNG's best non regular characters.  &quot;The Romulan Stratagem&quot; clearly puts this author in my top ten Star Trek authors list.<br />The cover art for this novel is above average for the time in which this novel was published.<br />The premise:<br />The Enterprise is on a mission to the planet Eloh, which is dangerously close to the Klingon/Romulan border, to negotiate its potential Federation membership.  Upon arrival though, a Romulan Warbird shows up and it's commanded by Commander Sela and she's there to &quot;negotiate&quot; with the Elohsians as well, hoping that they will soon join the Romulan Star Empire.<br />A series of fatal incidents brings suspicion upon both delegations and Data must form an uneasy alliance with Sela in order to prove the innocence of the Enterprise; at stake is this strategic stronghold, vital to the Federations vigilance of the Romulan Star Empire.<br />I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction.  Author Robert Greenberger's work with this novel deserves all the praise that is possible for it.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-02

As a general rule I do not normally like to completely run an author's work into the ground, so in this case my intent is to be as fair as possible with reference to this title.  It was not thoroughly surprising to see &quot;Warped&quot; be the second and final Star Trek novel by KW Jeter, who I know to be a very popular author in other genres.  Between this and his first DS9 novel &quot;Bloodletter,&quot; an astute fan of the series can quickly catch on that the author just didn't seem to grasp the characters or the overall theme of the series very well.<br />Although no one but those at Pocket Books can say for certain, I believe that the reason that this was the only hardback Star Trek Deep Space Nine release up until DS9's &quot;Unity,&quot; which is due out this year, is because &quot;Warped&quot; did so poorly in sales due to it's slow pace and lack of familiarity to the actual series.  I find this to be a sad fact as well, considering the novels that came out later that so richly deserved a hardback release!  <br />The cover art for this novel is standard fare for the time it was published, not exceptionally imaginative.<br />The premise:<br />Attempting to capitalize on the outstanding second season trilogy episodes of &quot;The Homecoming,&quot; &quot;The Circle&quot; and &quot;The Siege,&quot; the author brings into play these aspects, playing on the political strife in the newly formed Bajoran provisional government.  A series of murders occurs on the station and Commander Sisko finds himself dealing with a new religious faction that wishes to force the Federation away from Bajor.<br />Odo soon traces the mysterious murders on the station to a dangerous new form of holosuite technology which has also affected Commander Sisko's son, Jake.  Sisko must now deal with this new religious faction and the very real possibility of murder coming his way from any direction, to include his own son.<br />I've also owned the audio tape for this novel for several years;read by Rene Auberjonois, it can be an &quot;okay&quot; distraction for three hours while driving down the highway.  Of course, Rene Auberjonois' reading is excellent for what he was reading.<br />Overall, the premise to this story is an extraordinarily intriguing one; it's in the execution of the story where it falls flat.  I would only recommend this title as a collectors or completist's type find.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-02

Surprisingly enough, \\"Valhalla\\" was only the first of two Star Trek novels for this outstanding author.  I found his writing style to be fairly well paced and he had a thorough grasp of the characters and the overall theme of the series at the time in which this novel was published.  This type of Star Trek Deep Space Nine novel is truly what DS9 was about at that time; a mystery from the Gamma Quadrant floating through the wormhole and the good old Cardassians from right next door, coming to waive their flag and make threats.  It would certainly be nice to see this author make a return to the Star Trek universe after so many years away.<br />The cover art for this novel is pretty much standard fair for the time in which it was published and can even be considered lower than that considering the extremely poor rendition of Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor), which I find it surprising that she checked off on it.<br />The premise:<br />The Cardassians are raising the tension levels on the station and Bajor once again due to speculation that they may attempt to reoccupy Bajor, but things become complicated even further when a mysterious ship comes through the wormhole from the Gamma Quadrant.  The crew of this ship is found dead and some very valuable technology from the Gamma Quadrant is found.  Sisko soon finds that he must deal both with the Cardassians who are attempting to seize control of this ship and Kira who believes it to be Bajoran property.<br />When the alien ship suddenly seizes control of Deep Space Nine, Sisko finds he must now face this alien entity controlling the station and the Cardassians who are attempting to seize control of it.  Here is where a very special player comes into play that came from the first season episode \\"The Forsaken.\\"<br />I highly recommend this early Deep Space Nine novel to any and all fans of the series and Star Trek fiction in general.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-02

I found it interesting to read in the interview with Greg Cox by Kevin Dilmore in the back of &quot;Star Trek The Q Continuum&quot; that Greg Cox and John Gregory Betancourt had written &quot;Devil in the Sky&quot; with only the series bible, the script for &quot;Emissary&quot; and having only watched a few episodes.  The reason I found this so interesting is that in this novel, which was the inaugural Star Trek novel for both authors, they captured the characters and the feel of Star Trek Deep Space Nine so well.  You will quickly find that the pacing of this novel and both authors overall writing styles lend well to a quick and thoroughly enjoyable read.<br />Both authors proved with this novel that both of their works, whether collaborative or individual, are to be looked forward to.  One of the main themes that started in this novel and has continued to today in novels written by Greg Cox, is his penchant for using characters and species from all of the series, but most especially the Original Series, such as his use of the Hortas in this novel, which according to his interview with Kevin Dilmore was John Ordover's idea.<br />&quot;Devil in the Sky&quot; also lends itself very well to the early feel of the series.  This is the type of story you &quot;could've&quot; seen on the series, except for the prohibitive costs of using the Horta via a heavy amount of CGI.<br />The cover art for &quot;Devil in the Sky&quot; isn't all that imaginative other than the drawing of a Horta, giving a potential reader that this creature from the Original Series is included in the story.<br />The premise:<br />Bajor has recruited the Hortas from Janus VI to help rebuild their devastated mining industry all in the hopes of revitalizing their struggling economy.  Unfortunately for the Hortas and the Bajorans, Cardassian raiders step in and abduct the Mother Horta.  Now Commander Sisko finds himself stuck with twenty Horta eggs and they suddenly begin to hatch and the only food sourcefor them appears to be Deep Space Nine itself.  Meanwhile, Major Kira sets out on a rescue mission, deep in Cardassian space.<br />I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of the series or Star Trek in general.  If you've never read a novel written by one or both of these authors, you will soon learn that they can definitely be counted among some of the best that Star Trek has to offer.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-02

Surprisingly enough, out of all of the Star Trek novels written by the LA Graf (Let's All Get Rich and Famous) writing team of Julia Ecklar and Karen Rose Cercone, this was the first one of theirs that I'd read.  I found their writing style for this novelization of Voyager's lead off episode to be very well written and fast paced, easily accomplishing what novelizations are for.  They deftly added several &quot;between the scenes&quot; scenes that weren't scene on screen and enhanced those scenes we did see with some very interesting personal dialogue.<br />The cover art for this novelization is nothing spectacular but it does serve well in what it was designed to do, give the fans a photo of the new and exciting crew!<br />As is custom with novelizations of Star Trek movies and pilot episodes, there is an eight page set of black &amp; white photos included.<br />The premise:<br />The newly commissioned Intrepid class USS Voyager NCC-74656, commanded by Captain Kathryn Janeway sets out on the mission to find a particular band of Maquis in the badlands.  Here is where the novelization goes above and beyond the episode; the novelization begins with an excellent introspective opening sequence with Chakotay, a Maquis leader.<br />Voyager arrives at Deep Space Nine to pick up some additional crew members and then she heads out for the badlands with her crew to find the Maquis.  Unbeknownst to them, an entity known as the Caretaker has spirited the Maquis raider some seventy thousand light years away, deep in the Delta Quadrant and they're heading for that same destiny.<br />Captain Janeway and her crew find themselves in the same situation; deep in the Delta Quadrant, several crew members dead or missing and those left alive being held captive by the Caretaker.  In true Janeway fashion, she soon learns what must be done and has to make the ultimate decision that will leave her crew and the remaining crew of the Maquis raider stranded in the Delta Quadrant, looking at seventy years at maximum warp to get home to the Alpha Quadrant and the Federation.<br />Thus begins the wonderful seven year journey, where at many times, the series didn't quite live up to the expectations of many Star Trek fans but it was still some very decent Star Trek and a journey that I enjoyed watching.<br />I highly recommend this novel to those that can find a copy of it.  It serves well as a beginning to the series of novels for Star Trek fiction readers!  While several of the early Star Trek Voyager stories couldn't exactly be classified as &quot;classics,&quot; it's worth it to read through them and this is the best place to start.  {ssintrepid}	2003-11-01

After trudging my way through the first book in this series, Star Trek #89 &quot;Wagon Train to the Stars,&quot; I found &quot;Belle Terre&quot; to be somewhat of a welcome relief.  As stated in my review for the first book in the New Earth series, the whole concept of the New Earth series is a very interesting and intriguing one but &quot;Wagon Train to the Stars&quot; just didn't execute on this extremely interesting premise very well.  &quot;Belle Terre&quot; does pick up on the pace of the story quite nicely though.  There are points in which the pace still seems to drag, thus causing the novel one star.<br />The cover art for this novel is much better than previous novels and it lends to the story quite well.<br />The premise:<br />At the conclusion of Star Trek #89 &quot;Wagon Train to the Stars,&quot; Captain Kirk has successfully guided the colony and its sixty two thousand members and ships through treachery and attack from outsiders to Belle Terre.<br />As &quot;Belle Terre&quot; begins we learn that the Quake Moon, which had been focused on during the first novel of this series, is a moon that contains a large quantity of Quantum olivium which is an extremely rare and valuable substance to the Federation and other civilizations.  Captain Kirk is elated to find this out as this rare substance will greatly help the new colony but those hopes are quickly dashed as Spock reveals that the moon is under so much internal pressure that it is going to explode and destroy Belle Terre in the process.<br />Captain Kirk, the crew of the Enterprise and the colonists must now find a way to stop this massive explosion or be prepared to evacuate the colony and hope to make it back to Federation space before they run out of supplies.<br />What I found even more interesting about this novel was the subplot in which Captain Kirk asked one of the pathfinder ships and its captain to find a suitable planet that the colonists can be taken to in the event that they cannot preventthe destruction of Belle Terre.  Captain Sunn and hid small crew take their pathfinder ship, the Rattlesnake and an extremely intriguing jaunt and find a very interesting world that was once populated but is now approximately one hundred years barren.<br />What follows from there is a Star Trek numbered novel that far outweighs the leadoff book in this series.  The one unfortunate thing about it is that the subplot is much more interesting than the main plot.<br />I would recommend this novel and New Earth series more as a collectors/completists type read.  While they are by far not the best in Trek fiction, they're not the worst either.  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-26
US	52712162	R3SPMC1U3K0MXC	0671042963	50403318	Wagon Train to the Stars (Star Trek No 89, New Earth Book One of Six)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	ST #89 Wagon Train to the Stars - Poor balance and pacing!	Star Trek #89 &quot;Wagon Train to the Stars&quot; is the first book in the New Earth series.  The concept behind this six book series is Captain Kirk, who, after the events depicted in &quot;Star Trek The Motion Picture&quot; has given up his Admiral's rank to Captain the Enterprise as she leads an &quot;armada&quot; of over sixty thousand would be colonists who are on their way to Belle Terre to begin a new life.<br />At the core of this concept is a very solid and interesting premise.  To see the stalwart hero of Star Trek leading an enormous group of civilians who don't exactly have to bide by the rules of Starfleet on an extraordinarily long trek (pun intended) through space, out of Federation space, into the unknown to settle a tame but raw M (Munshara) class planet and begin a new life.  The colonists and their governor, Evan Pardonnet is seeking to not only start a new colony, but they also wish to be almost entirely independent from the Federation.<br />With that very basic concept laid out, concept creator and author Diane Carey leads off this series of books with &quot;A Wagon Train to the Stars.&quot;  From the beginning I found this concept to have been an interesting one and was looking forward to getting to these books, despite the generally lackluster reviews and ratings for the majority of the books in this series; wishing to judge for myself upon reading them.<br />If time devoted to reading a particular book is any indicator of how well a book was written, this novel doesn't score too well because I found that I just couldn't relate to it very well based on its pacing.  I've been reading Star Trek fiction for years now and I'm not normally one to critique Star Trek novels too harshly based on continuity and pacing problems generally because the majority of the novels are just entertaining and quick reads that equivocate to a good Star Trek &quot;fix,&quot; if you will.<br />I found &quot;A Wagon Train to the Stars&quot; to be a contradiction to many of Diane Carey's past stories in that at times, it seemed to be disjointed or more or less she would just skip over certain parts that needed to be there, assuming that the reader was still with her.  I don't know if this was spawned from her original manuscript or poor editing on the part of the publisher.<br />I've found that many Star Trek fiction readers have complained of Diane Carey's adding her extensive knowledge of naval terminology into the twenty third and twenty fourth century terminology of Starfleet to be distracting.  I don't particularly agree with this point of view; while such terminology is not canon to the series, it just gives her novels a distinct flavor all her own and I've found it to be interesting.<br />The cover art for this first book in the New Earth series can be counted among the best in the Star Trek fiction genre.  It is certainly very rare indeed that this much effort is put into one of these covers.<br />The premise:<br />I've already covered the &quot;basic&quot; premise to this first novel in the series.  Along with that, Captain Kirk finds himself, leading this armada of colony ships to Belle Terre, but along the way he finds that he must deal with a criminal named Billy Maidenshore who he'd personally arrested not too long before this mission began.  Somehow, Maidenshore worked the legal system and didn't stay behind bars very long and has worked his way into to this colony and has sworn to cause as many problems for Captain Kirk and company as he can.<br />Combining that aspect and the general problems that Captain Kirk finds himself dealing with as the &quot;imposed&quot; leader of this expedition and the sixty thousand plus colonists makes for some interesting but not well executed plot between himself and several different leading characters.  He soon finds that he must find a way to earn the trust and confidence of these colonists in order to more efficiently lead this colony on its trip or they will most certainly failand perish.<br />The one saving grace for this novel is the extremely well executed conclusion to it, where Diane Carey pulled some of her better writing abilities out of the proverbial hat and put it on the page, so to speak!<br />In conclusion, being a devout Star Trek fiction reader, I'd recommend this novel as it is the first in the series and gives the basics for the rest of the books, I would have to say that this is not the best novel Diane Carey has put on the shelves, but it is most certainly not the worst in the world of Star Trek fiction.  If this is or was the first Diane Carey Star Trek novel you've read or are reading, I implore you not to take the position that this is what all of her novels are like.  The good majority of her novels can be categorized as among the best in Star Trek fiction that are completely enjoyable reads.  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-26

Graf (Let's All Get Rich and Famous), Julia Ecklar and Karen Rose Cercone Star Trek novel that I've read now and I hate to admit it, but with the exception of their Star Trek Deep Space Nine Day of Honor novel, &quot;Armageddon Sky,&quot; which was an excellent novel, their novels just don't seem to grab me as a reader.  This novel doesn't transcend that feeling too well either.  It may be their writing style, which for the majority of their novels seems to have a pacing problem and they just don't seem to grab the reader and give them the compelling feeling towards the story or the characters.<br />This third novel in the Star Trek New Earth series, &quot;Rough Trails, does have one thing going for it though, it doesn't center around the three primary characters of Kirk, Spock and McCoy, as the majority of the novels and all of the episodes and movies do.<br />The cover art for this novel is an exception to the norm as well as it does paint a bright picture of Belle Terre.  It may not be the Belle Terre that is described throughout a majority of this novel but it does come into play later in the novel.<br />The premise:<br />Following where the last novel, &quot;Belle Terre&quot; left off in which Captain Kirk was forced to move a small moon from a gas giant in the Belle Terre (Occult) solar system and crash it into Belle Terre's olivium rich moon in order to vent it and prevent it from exploding, &quot;Rough Trails&quot; sets a new tone for the New Earth series.<br />It is now some time after Belle Terre's olivium rich moon was struck by the other moon but during that explosion, debris from the collision hit Belle Terre, changing its environment in a very bad way.  The colonists, who were more or less forced to stay due to a lack of supplies for the extraordinarily long journey back to Federation space, are now faced with living in the conditions created by the debris' collision with Belle Terre's surface.<br />Chekov, has been recently promoted to Lieutenant Commander and is scheduled to depart to become the First Officer on the USS Reliant has been working on the planets orbital platform while Kirk and the Enterprise have been patrolling the fringes of the system, preventing piracy of the olivium.  Scotty, Uhura and Sulu have been working on the planets surface attempting to make things better for the colonists.  Uhura has been attempting to create a communications system that works on the planet which is presently in the dry season and the atmosphere is laden with olivium dust which has been preventing a viable communications system.<br />As the story opens up, Chekov has hitched a ride down to the planets surface on a re-supply shuttle but during the shuttles run, it's shot down.  Here is one of the few intriguing moments of this novel as Chekov must lead himself and the shuttle's crew members out from the bottom of Crater Lake, where the shuttle crash landed.<br />What follows from there is a tale, which in some ways contradicts some established facts from the two previous Star Trek New Earth novels, in which Chekov goes through a series of extraordinary events on this desolate planet and it's now, seemingly barbaric colonists and where Sulu and Uhura are doing everything they can to locate Chekov.  Along the way, Sulu and Uhura discover that Crater Lake is about the break and the resulting flood will destroy everything in its path, causing them to divert their search for Chekov as they must warn as many colonists as possible.<br />I would only recommend this novel as it is part of the Star Trek New Earth series and that while this series may not be the best that Pocket Books have put out; it's still somewhat interesting to read.  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-26

After the disappointing first and third books in this series and the second book being only slightly better, Star Trek #92 &quot;The Flaming Arrow,&quot; to me, provided some salvation for the series.  This being only the second book by Jerry Oltion that I've read and, I believe, the first &quot;full&quot; story for his wife, Kathy Oltion, I can now say with a great amount of certainty that they're both excellent writers and their Star Trek tales are to be looked forward to.<br />They both have a very fluidic writing style and the pacing of the novel stays on an even keel the whole way through, making for a quick and compelling read.  I especially like how they threw in little tidbits of Trek trivia without making them a focal point for pages and pages and without making them the &quot;do you remember&quot; kind of clich&eacute;'s that so often pop up in Star Trek novels.  They're characterizations are &quot;dead on&quot; good characterizations that don't leave you, the reader, questioning the responses by the characters.<br />The cover art for &quot;The Flaming Arrow&quot; is outstanding and it's good to see cover art that has gotten away from the &quot;plaster a few character's faces on the cover and it'll be alright.&quot;<br />The premise:<br />After facing an alien armada bent on destroying them on the way to Belle Terre; the near destruction of the entire planet due to their moon threatening to explode and a massive flood caused by greedy olivium miners, the Belle Terre colonist face their largest challenge yet, a massive, planet killing laser beam fired at them by the Kauld.<br />Captain Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise, having been charged with the safety of the colony and then later, upon the discovery of the massive deposit of olivium on the Quake moon, charged with protecting the olivium at all costs, and has successfully defended both in all cases, must now come up with the impossible; how to stop a massive laser beam from destroying Belle Terre and its colonists, or evacuate them all and take their chances returning to Federation space.<br />What follows from there, as stated above, is the best of the first four New Earth novels.

The only \\"minor\\" trepidation that I had at that time was that prior to Greg Cox tackling a story with Q in it, only Peter David had done so and quite successfully.  This was a very minor thing though considering Greg Cox's previous Star Trek titles and knowing just how well he writes.  As expected, this trepidation was quickly dissipated because Greg Cox can definitely write Q with ease!<br />Contained within the pages of this extraordinarily well written and beautifully reprinted Signature Edition is most certainly one of the best trilogies to have ever been written for Star Trek.  Greg Cox knows Star Trek, inside and out, and unlike other author's attempts to throw in little tidbits of Trek trivia, where it comes out rather dull and trite, he deftly adds to his current story, using that which has already been established.<br />Included with this Signature Edition is an excellent interview with Greg Cox by Kevin Dilmore, one of Star Trek's up and coming authors.  The cover art for this Signature Edition novel serves the story quite well.<br />The premise:<br />Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise have been entrusted with the mission of ferrying a brilliant Federation scientist to the great barrier which encompasses the Milky Way galaxy where he intends to prove his theoretical way to breach it.  Unfortunately for Picard and crew and quite fortunate for us the readers, Q makes an appearance and he takes Picard with him, leaving behind his \\"wife\\" and \\"child,\\" much to the chagrin of Riker and the rest of the crew who're stuck with them.<br />What follows from there is an extraordinary, fast pace and highly intriguing tale in the mythos that is Star Trek where Q takes Picard throughout history, to include visits to the Tkon Empire and the inside of a star and many other exotic settings for a Star Trek novel.<br />I highly recommend this Signature Edition version of The Q Continuum or the three paperback novels, STNG #'s 47-49 to any and all fans of the genre.  You will soon learn that novels written by Greg Cox are not to be missed.  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-26

This fifth book in the Star Trek New Earth series, &quot;Thin Air&quot; more or less comes as a breath of &quot;fresh&quot; air as it falls in line with a typical novel written by these two excellent authors, Kristine Kathryn Rusch and Dean Wesley Smith.  Up to this point in the New Earth series, despite the overall premise being an extraordinarily interesting one, the execution of the premise has been plodding and just plain difficult to get through.  &quot;Thin Air,&quot; is a quick read entailing a very intriguing plot device for Captain Kirk and crew to get through.<br />Keeping in line with the Star Trek releases at the time of this novels release, the cover art for the novel is quite beautiful.  That's the funny thing about the whole New Earth series; the cover art for all of them up to them has been quite outstanding which has been quite the opposite of what's inside most of the books.<br />The premise:<br />After dealing with the massive laser beam fired at Belle Terre in the previous novel, &quot;The Flaming Arrow,&quot; Captain Kirk and crew now find that they must deal with an even more insidious attack upon Belle Terre by the Kauld.  As the previous novel &quot;The Flaming Arrow&quot; opened up, The Kauld had sent a single battle barge at Belle Terre, which was headed straight for the planet and when the Enterprise attacked it, it didn't put up a fight at all.  The Kauld battle barge was destroyed in the upper atmosphere of Belle Terre.<br />Captain Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise now find that Belle Terre will soon be completely uninhabitable if they do not come up with a way of stopping these Kauld nanoassemblers from turning Belle Terre's own soil into a siliconic gel that will suffocate every living being on the planet.<br />Of all of the Star Trek New Earth titles up to this point, &quot;Thin Air&quot; is only second to &quot;The Flaming Arrow&quot; in intensity and intrigue.  I was especially intrigued by the plot device of the siliconic gel, which is what Science Fiction is all about.

Back in form with her usual style of writing, &quot;Challenger&quot; is a true joy to read as the pacing is &quot;dead on&quot; and the story just flows.  I particularly enjoyed the fact that she carried the main plot and two sub plots in this story and brought all three of them together for a somewhat anticlimactic, but highly intriguing conclusion.<br />The cover art for &quot;Challenger&quot; is perfect, as was the cover art for the entire series.<br />The premise:<br />Shaking off the events of the previous novel &quot;Thin Air,&quot; Captain Kirk and crew are quite expectant as their relief is on its way in the form of the USS Peleliu, who are expected to stand as the Starfleet authority in the Occult system for the next two years.<br />As the USS Peleliu is headed for Belle Terre though, she is suddenly attacked by the All Kauld, during gamma night, and her captain, Roger Lake starts showing signs of mentally cracking after he'd been exposed to an undetectable virus, some time before this mission began.  Weakened but not destroyed, the Peleliu comes limping into the Occult system.  The first officer was also killed, leaving the second officer, Lieutenant Nick Keller, to deal with the problems set before him; a nearly destroyed Starship and a mentally unstable captain.<br />At Belle Terre, Captain Kirk and Spock are dealing with a whole new issue; mysterious, inter-dimensional probes that are impervious to phaser fire are taking the quantum olivium and stuffing it back into the Quake moon.<br />Billy Maidenshore, originally imprisoned earlier in the series has now freed himself and he's taken over an olivium runner known as the Pandora's Box, which had also been converted into a prison ship.  Along with his control of the ship and olivium mining, he's taken Uhura and McCoy captive.<br />Diane Carey beautifully rolls all of these events into a solid, well told, fast paced novel in which Captain Kirk must find a way of stopping these mysterious probes from stealing the olivium, Lt. Commander Nick Keller has to deal with the destruction of his ship and his crazed captain and Uhura and McCoy must find a way to stop Billy Maidenshore.<br />I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction!  Even if you find it difficult or impossible to make it through the first few books of the New Earth series, I believe &quot;Challenger&quot; can be read on its own.  {ssintrepid}into a prison ship.

I found \\"Proud Helios\\" to have a somewhat intriguing plot and the author carried a fairly decent pace throughout the novel.  \\"Proud Helios\\" is one of the earlier Star Trek Deep Space Nine novels so when picking up this novel keep that in mind because when this novel was written and published, the series was still in its second and third seasons and as any fan of the show knows, character and plot wise, it was very much in a state of flux at that time.<br />The cover art for \\"Proud Helios\\" is very typical for the time of its publishing, which doesn't really show much in imagination.<br />The premise:<br />Bajor depends quite heavily on the flow of traffic to the Gamma Quadrant through the wormhole and when that flow is suddenly interrupted by a mysterious ship using a cloaking device it is time for Commander Sisko to step in and stop it.  This mysterious ship also starts attacking Cardassian ships as well, which brings about an unexpected alliance between Sisko and Gul Dukat.  <br />As this novel is one of the earlier Deep Space Nine novels and I recommend all of them, I will also recommend this novel more as one of those \\"completists\\" type novels for Trek fiction readers.  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-24

Star Trek &quot;Generations&quot; represents J.M. Dillard's fourth Star Trek movie novelization.  Of course there's a good reason she's done the novelizations for every movie since Star Trek V &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; and the novelization for Star Trek Deep Space Nine's premier episode &quot;Emissary,&quot; she's extraordinarily good at it and this one is no exception!<br />When a reader picks up the novelization for an episode or a movie, they're looking for a couple of things; some personalization to what the characters are thinking during the scenes and some good &quot;between the scenes&quot; scenes and in every novelization of J.M. Dillard's I've read so far, she accomplishes that with ease.  Her writing style is very fluid and the pacing is very good, producing a very engaging story that enhances what was seen on the silver screen or the home television screen.<br />Credit also goes to Rick Berman, Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga for the original story and screenplay for Star Trek &quot;Generations&quot; which, in my opinion, has been a rather unjustly maligned movie over the years.  The overall story is a good one, that is well grounded in what Star Trek is all about and I believe Gene Roddenberry would've been very proud of this movie!<br />Also included in the hardback version are some great color photos taken directly from the film.  The paperback version has the same photos but they're black &amp; white.  Both versions have the &quot;Behind the Scenes of Star Trek Generations&quot; A Special Report by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens which is a great little read entailing some of what it took to make the movie.<br />The cover art for &quot;Generations&quot; is, of course, directly from the movie posters and is very nice and much better than what was the standard fare for cover art at the time of this novels release!<br />The premise:<br />The novel opens up with an extremely poignant scene between Captain James T. Kirk and Spock, set one year prior to the launch of the third ship named Enterprise.  The novel then follows up with an exceptional scene with Kirk plunging towards the Earth during an orbital skydive that was planned to have been in the movie but time constraints eliminated it.<br />In what many thought to be described as a dignified way of ending future possibilities for screen time for Captain James T. Kirk, the next scene in the novel and first, opening scene of the movie shows him saving the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-B and &quot;dying,&quot; while doing so.<br />Seventy eight years later we're taken to the holodeck of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D and Lieutenant Worf's rather interesting promotion ceremony to Lieutenant Commander.<br />What follows from there is a novel that is extraordinarily well written that serves beautifully to enhance what was seen on the silver screen.  I highly recommend this novel, whether you can pick it up in hardback or paperback!  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-13

After the serious nature of author Dafydd Ab Hugh's first Star Trek novel, Deep Space Nines #5 &quot;Fallen Heroes,&quot; &quot;Balance of Power&quot; is a lighter hearted, much more whimsical novel, while still possessing a story of a serious nature that is well told.  I definitely like Dafydd Ab Hugh's writing style as well, as it is fluidic, with good pacing that doesn't bog down too often.  The characterizations for this novel were &quot;dead on&quot; accurate for the known characters in each situation.<br />The cover art for this novel is pretty much the bland, standard fare for when it was published.<br />The premise:<br />In an unusual premise for a STNG novel, the author draws primarily from known characters between STNG and DS9, bringing them into a hilarious, well told tale.  It was especially nice to see Grand Nagus Zek get some time in a novel!<br />A famous Federation scientist dies and his son puts up many of his quirky inventions for auction to the highest bidder.  Many Federation and non Federation races come to this auction, in hopes of acquiring the technology.  Among those items being auctioned is a powerful photon pulse canon that is capable of punching right through a starships shields; an item that the Federation would definitely not like to see in the hands of the Klingons, Romulans or Cardassians.<br />In a bold move for a novel, the author also brings Wesley Crusher at Starfleet Academy into the story.  (I say bold move because for some reason, many &quot;fans&quot; totally rejected this character out of hand.)  While attempting to aide his best friend, Wesley finds himself kidnapped by outlaw Ferengi that are bent on controlling the universe through commerce and they've set their sights on the photon pulse canon.  Captain Picard now finds himself in a race to save not only the Enterprise but the entire Federation from this deadly weapon and those controlling it while having every antagonistic race in the Alpha Quadrant aligned against him.<br />What follows from there is an extremely hilarious and enjoyable STNG novel that I highly recommend to any and all fans of the genre!  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-13

Oddly enough, Star Trek Deep Space Nine #8 &quot;Antimatter&quot; is John Vornholt's only Deep Space Nine novel over the years.  From his very first Star Trek novel, STNG #7 &quot;Masks,&quot; one learns that his stories are ones that you don't wish to miss.  John Vornholt does a wonderful job of setting up the scenery for most every scene in his novels, without detracting from the story at all.  His writing style has always been very engaging, with good pacing that doesn't bog down in the details.  The plot development for &quot;Antimatter&quot; is intriguing and the author's timing is perfect!<br />The cover art for &quot;Antimatter&quot; is standard fare for the time in which this novel was released.<br />The premise:<br />In a plan to revitalize Bajor's ravished economy, Starfleet commissions one of their shipyards to build a new engine.  A tanker full of the valuable cargo of antimatter for this new starship is headed for Bajor but is instead hijacked and taken through the wormhole.  The hijacking sparks a hot political debate which Major Kira is left to deal with while Commander Sisko, Dax and Odo infiltrate the hijackers in hopes of recovering the antimatter and soon discover that there is a much more deadly plan than just the hijacking of the antimatter and the stakes become immeasurably higher...<br />What follows from there, as stated above, is one of the better earlier Deep Space Nine novels that is very fast paced and engaging to read.  I highly recommend this John Vornholt novel and any of his other titles as he is truly one of Star Trek's better authors.  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-13

This is the first of only two Star Trek titles for author Esther Friesner, both of which, I thought were well thought out and rather well written novels.  \\"Warchild\\" is set between the first and second season of Deep Space Nine and is very true to the type of stories being told on the show at that time.  This was a time of course, when the series was fleshing itself out and hadn't quite kicked into its main theme of dealing with the Dominion and I believe the author captured that rather well.<br />If one pays attention to the plot of this story, you'll also see certain similarities to aired episodes, especially in Dr. Bashir's case, a character she captured with ease in this story.  I found her writing to be fairly fluidic and the pacing of the book, though it slows in some areas, was set reasonably well!  Overall, the premise for \\"Warchild\\" is a very intriguing and interesting one, but the pacing detracts from the overall experience.  <br />The cover art for this title is, unfortunately, from a time when not an excessive amount thought went into the cover art for Star Trek books and it falls into the old, \\"slap some caricatures on there and an image of the station and everything will be fine.\\"<br />The premise:<br />A message left behind by Kai Opaka gives Commander Sisko a fateful mission; find a young Bajoran girl who is destined to be a great a great healer and who can stop the warring between Bajoran factions.  Jadzia heads for Bajor to find this young girl and at the same time, Dr. Bashir goes there to treat a rare disease that is killing Bajoran children in resettlement camps.  Dr. Bashir goes absent without leave in his quest to find a cure for this disease and Jadzia finds the young girl, but she too, is suffering from this strange disease.  Sisko must now find Bashir in order to save this girl who \\"may\\" be Bajor's last chance for peace...<br />What follows from there is definitely a fairly decent early Star Trek Deep Space Nine story that, as stated above,faithfully fits right in with the type of stories being told during the shows first couple of seasons.  I would definitely recommend this title to any and all fans of the series.  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-12

Although this exceptional numbered novel is today considered to be one of the early &quot;Stargazer&quot; novels, it is most definitely considered one of the best novels written to date by Star Trek's most prolific author Michael Jan Friedman and former Star Trek editor, Kevin Ryan.  Few of the numbered novels can even compare to this fast paced, &quot;historically&quot; rich Star Trek novel.  This novel is a pure sign of MJ Friedman's &quot;true&quot; genius and one of the reasons why he is Star Trek's most prolific author; he knows what the fans want to read about, primarily because he's a fan who also has the best job for a fan and the talent to back it up.<br />Within these pages you'll find a story involving both the crew of the Enterprise NCC-1701-D and Captain Picard and the crew of the USS Stargazer, some twenty five years earlier.  You'll also have a chance to visit Cestus III, first seen in the classic Star Trek episode, &quot;Arena&quot; and of course, the Gorn, who claimed sovereignty over the planet.<br />Although the cover art does contain an &quot;interesting&quot; image of a younger Captain Jean Luc Picard and a drawing of the Gorn from &quot;Arena,&quot; it's pretty much standard fare for the time in which this novel was published.<br />The premise:<br />Twenty five years prior to this story; Captain Jean Luc Picard, captain of the USS Stargazer, negotiated a breakthrough with the Gorn.  Now, on the twenty fifth anniversary of that breakthrough, Captain Picard and the Enterprise are headed for the Gorn Homeworld to continue those negotiations.<br />While en route to the Gorn Home world, the Enterprise discovers a mysterious alien artifact and suddenly, Captain Picard disappears.  Just as Commander Riker and the Enterprise begins the investigation in to what happened to their Captain, the summit with the Gorn goes terribly wrong and war now looms over the Alpha Quadrant and Captain Picard is desperately needed to prevent it.  Captain Picard finds that he's been transported through time and is now on Cestus III, shortly before the Gorn attack it, leaving only one survivor.<br />What follows from there is, as stated above, one of the best numbered Star Trek The Next Generation novels to date.  I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of the genre and especially to those who've read MJ Friedman's Stargazer novels and would like to read as much on Captain Picard's time as the Captain of that ship as possible.  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-12

For several years now, Diane Carey has been the &quot;go to&quot; author for most of the novelizations of the major episodes in all of the latest Star Trek series.  &quot;The Search&quot; is but the second of her novelizations and, while not the best of them, she does a fairly decent job with the novelization of these two, pivotal episodes in the Deep Space Nine series.<br />When reading a novelization of an episode or movie, the reader is looking for but a couple things, some personalization to the characters thoughts throughout the episode and some &quot;between the scenes&quot; scenes.  Diane Carey accomplishes that in &quot;The Search,&quot; and sets a very good tone for the story, to include the characterizations and the pacing of the novel.<br />The cover art unfortunately is from a time in Star Trek publishing where not a lot of thought was put into the cover, so there really isn't much on the cover that lends to the story other than an image of a Jem'Hadar warship.<br />The premise:<br />The history:<br />&quot;The Search&quot; constitutes one of the most pivotal times in the &quot;saga&quot; that is Star Trek Deep Space Nine.  Coming off of the second season finale, &quot;The Jem'Hadar,&quot; where we learned a lot more about them when Sisko, Jake, Quark and Nog took a runabout to the Gamma Quadrant to go camping.  The Jem'Hadar took Sisko and Quark prisoner but Jake and Nog were able to escape and managed to get the runabout to help.  Starfleet sends the USS Odyssey, a Galaxy class starship, through the wormhole to make a rescue attempt for Commander Sisko.  The Odyssey immediately runs into several Jem'Hadar warships and is destroyed, quite easily.  The ending for this episode is quite ominous, leading up to the beginning of the third season, &quot;The Search&quot; parts I and II.<br />The Search<br />As the episode and novel open up, Major Kira and crew are running drills to see how well the station would hold up against a Dominion attack and they're &quot;not exactly&quot; happy with the results.  Just as this finishes up, they receive warnings that a ship is de-cloaking right on top of the station but to their great relief it's a Starfleet ship, but of a class they've never seen before.<br />As part of his time between the loss of the USS Saratoga at Wolf 359 and being stationed on Deep Space Nine, Commander Sisko helped design and build the USS Defiant, Starfleet's toughest little ship, which was their answer to Borg problem.  Due to design errors though, a fleet of these ships wasn't built though and the project was abandoned until the onset of the war with the Dominion.<br />As the Federations and Starfleet's answer to the Jem'Hadar problem, they send Commander Sisko and the Defiant into the Gamma Quadrant to look for the leaders of the Dominion to tell them that they mean them no harm, but at the same time, the Defiant also carries the message that they can defend themselves.<br />At the same time, Sisko also brings back Commander Eddington to head up Starfleet security on the station which prompts Odo to resign.  Major Kira does talk him into going with them into the Gamma Quadrant and he suddenly finds that he has a calling.<br />What follows from there is certainly one of the best stories ever written for Star Trek Deep Space Nine and certainly a great novelization where we finally learn about the Dominion and the irony for Odo as to who the founders are.<br />I highly recommend this novelization to any and all fans of the genre.  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-12

I found their writing style to be well versed and engaging with pacing that doesn't bog down in the details.  They also do an outstanding job with the characterizations, especially Picard.  They captured his character with perfection and in this story; they put him in a situation that is very true to the character.  Between this novel and their next, Star Trek Voyager #18 &quot;Battle Lines,&quot; I'd definitely have to say that their novels are ones to be looked forward to.  The cover art for &quot;Foreign Foes&quot; is different from the norm, but not extraordinarily different.<br />The premise:<br />The Klingon Empire and the Hidran have been at war with each other for seventy years and Captain Picard, being the extraordinary diplomat that he is, is called in to mediate a treaty between the two highly aggressive, warring parties.  Things start off badly for Captain Picard and everybody else involved as the Hidran Ambassador mysteriously dies but as he's dying, as a last act of vengeance, he kills a Klingon delegate.<br />Lieutenant Worf is charged with the death of the Hidran ambassador and Commander Riker and Counselor Troi have become trapped far below the surface of the planet.  Now Captain Picard must not only find a way of ending the violence between the two warring factions but he must also find a way of saving Riker and Troi and exonerate Worf of the crime he's been accused of prior to a horrendous death sentence.<br />I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of the genre as it will certainly make an excellent addition to your Star Trek library!  Novels by this writing team to be greatly looked forward to.  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-11

I find this to be somewhat disappointing as the author did a rather decent job with the plot development and characterizations.  I found her writing style to be quite decent and the pacing of the novel to be reasonably engaging.  The plot for this story is very interesting and compelling.<br />The cover art for this title is reasonably decent, yet standard fare for the time in which this novel was published.<br />The premise:<br />Deep Space Nine is the staging ground for a conference in which ambassadors from all over the Federation have assembled to determine the future of Bajor.  As the stations personnel are having an already difficult time keeping all of these ambassadors happy, terrorist start blowing parts of the station, leaving Sisko and Odo the difficult task of trying to find and stop these ruthless terrorists.  To make matters worse, a new Cardassian Gul shows up demanding the return of Deep Space Nine to the Cardassian Union.  Commander Sisko must now diffuse this entire situation that threatens the very existence of Bajor.<br />What follows is a rather decent early Deep Space Nine story that is told fairly well and I would recommend this novel to any and all fans of the genre.  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-11

As is standard fare for a Michael Jan Friedman novel, it is another excellent read.  When setting out to put a novelization of an episode in print, the main things the readers are looking for are personalization of the characters thoughts during &quot;on screen&quot; moments and some added &quot;between&quot; the scenes, scenes.  MJ Friedman accomplishes this with great ease.<br />The only sad thing about this novel is that it was, at the time of its publishing, just another sign that an era of extraordinary and historic television had come to an end.  The upside would be the movies, for the better part, but overall, this show is sorely missed by many.<br />Credit to Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga for the original screenplay for &quot;All Good Things...&quot; which made up the outstanding conclusion to seven years of the some of the best television episodes ever to grace the home theater.<br />The cover art for this, the hardback and the later published paperback is &quot;right on&quot; with the overall theme of the television shows grand finale!<br />The premise:<br />As Star Trek The Next Generation began with Q introducing himself in &quot;Encounter at Farpoint,&quot; so does it end with him once again challenging humanities right to be among the stars in &quot;All Good Things...&quot;  How does he go about this; in his usual style of harassing but teaching Captain Picard, all at the same time.  Captain Picard wakes to find himself on board the Enterprise D at the time in which he belongs, yet before he awoke he was thoroughly convinced several years had passed and he'd been an old man.<br />What follows from there is nothing short of one of the most brilliant episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation and an outstanding novelization in which Captain Picard is bounced around between three different time periods and the past,present and future of not only the Enterprise and her gallant crew are at stake but humanity itself is at stake.<br />I highly recommend this novelization to any and all fans of Star Trek, whether you can find it in hardback or paperback.  I believe this is one story that Gene Roddenberry would truly have been proud of!  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-11

This being author Susan Wrights first Star Trek novel, I found her writing to be quite refreshing in the genre.  Her writing style is very fluidic and she always sets a great pace for the novel which doesn't waver too greatly at any time.  From this very first novel of hers I've found that her plot development is &quot;dead on&quot; and that she is capable of setting up enough intrigue and mystery in her novels that they're quite often very engaging, making for quick reads.<br />The cover art for this title is pretty much the standard fare, except for a Ferengi Marauder being on the cover with the standard drawings of Riker and Worf.<br />The premise:<br />The Enterprise is on a mission to save the planet Lessenar from environmental collapse and suddenly her crew finds themselves entangled in a web of treachery and murder.  When a member of a strange, emotion casting race is killed on board the ship, all evidence points to Worf and one of his oldest friends.  The Enterprise is soon under an emotional onslaught from the surviving aliens who're projecting their anger and pain at the crew.  Worf must now overcome this alien influence and find the true killer before the Enterprise, Lessenar and his honor are all lost.<br />This novel is most certainly one of the best early STNG novels and an outstanding debut for this author who has so many more great novels to follow this one.  I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of the genre.  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-11

I found &quot;Debtor's Planet&quot; to be one of those truly rare Star Trek novels where the author tackled something different that other authors haven't tried too often.  Given the time in which this novel was written and published, the Ferengi hadn't been explored too greatly on Star Trek The Next Generation just yet.  From what we had seen, we saw they're &quot;merchant&quot; militaristic types, which are completely in contradiction to the civilian types we grew to love on Deep Space Nine.<br />&quot;Debtor's Planet&quot; is the first of only two Star Trek novels by this author and I found their writing style to be fairly fluidic and the pacing to be, for the better part, fairly engaging.  I couldn't quite rate this one as highly as I'd like to though, given the characterization errors that seemed to jump out at a fan.  The overall plot development and pacing does overcome these blaring errors for me though.  It would be nice to see this author make another foray into the Star Trek genre after such a long absence.<br />The cover art is, not much better than the standard fare for the time though, but it does lend a bit to the story, letting the reader know that there will be a memorable character from the first season in this novel.<br />The premise:<br />A Vulcan space probe reports that the Ferengi are advancing the people of the planet Megara, from a pre-warp, primitive agricultural state to a sophisticated, technological society.  The Enterprise is ordered to transport a rather odd &quot;Ambassador&quot; to the planet to deal with this problem.  The Ambassador, Ralph Offenhouse, who was introduced in the first season's closing episode &quot;The Neutral Zone,&quot; is a ruthless, twentieth century business man whose character gets some decent fleshing out in this story.<br />Besides greatly advancing the Megaran people technologically, the Ferengi, who turn out to only be the puppets here, are turning the hard working and honorable people into vicious, xenophobic killers.  Captain Picard must now find a way to extricate the Ferengi and their puppet masters from this planet and in doing so, save the entire Federation.<br />What follows from there, is a fairly decent first novel for this author and one that I would definitely recommend to any and all fans of the genre.  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-11

The pen name of Sandy Schofield for this early Star Trek Deep Space Nine title is kind of funny actually when considering that the authors, husband and wife writing team Dean Wesley Smith and Kristine Kathryn Rusch felt that six names would be too many on the cover of a book.  Of course, this was their only Star Trek title using &quot;Sandy Schofield&quot; and every title since has had their complete names on them.<br />Taking into consideration that this is one of the earliest DS9 novels and the limited amount of episodes that the authors had in which to study the characters, I would say that they did a wonderful job of capturing the essence of the characters at this point in the series.  Given the fluidic nature of Deep Space Nine, it was a very trying time for authors to actually write and then publish stories for the series since things were changing so quickly on the series.<br />With &quot;The Big Game&quot; being the first novel written by these two fantastic authors; I found their writing style to be fairly fluidic and the pacing of the novel went quite well with the story being told.<br />The cover art for this early DS9 title is pretty much standard for the time in which this novel was produced.<br />The premise:<br />Quark, being the outstanding &quot;scoundrel&quot; and entertainer that he is decides to hold a high stakes poker tournament on the station.  Present for the tournament is several representatives from the many races of the Alpha quadrant.  Suddenly, one of the players is murdered and the stakes rise even higher for those playing.  At the same time, the station is rocked by a series of subspaces waves that threaten to destroy the station.  Now, Commander Sisko and Odo must find the killer in time to save the players and get the information from them that will save the station.<br />As a whole, as stated above, this is an excellent early DS9 title in which the authors captured the characters quite well, especially the oft times humorous quibbling between Quark and Odo, without taking it to the extreme.  I also rather enjoyed the use of characters seen previously in other series.  I highly recommend this early DS9 novel to any and all fans of the genre.  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-10

Being as nearly as much a fan of fantasy fiction as I am of Star Trek fiction, I found the premise of this novel to be quite an interesting and appealing one.  &quot;Here There Be Dragons&quot; is the first of only three Star Trek titles for author John Peel which is too bad in a way as I found all three of them to be quite well written stories.  It would be nice to see this author make another visit to the genre.<br />This author has a great writing style that is very fluidic and the story is very fast paced, full of action, intrigue and adventure.  This story also possesses something that many Star Trek novels either never attempt to do or attempt and fall flat on which is carrying more than a couple subplots into an extraordinary and surprising conclusion.<br />The cover art for this novel is a bit better than the standard fare; two of the main characters and a medieval castle with &quot;dragons&quot; flying over it.<br />The premise:<br />The Enterprise is investigating an interstellar cluster and suddenly receives news that a planet with a human colony on it is inside the cluster.  Here is where the Preservers come into play considering at this point that humans hadn't made it &quot;this&quot; far into deep space and when these humans came to this planet they did not possess the technology to penetrate the tachyon field of the interstellar cluster.<br />What is more shocking than the human presence here on this extraordinary planet is that the humans are living is a world of knights and serfs lifted right out of medieval times, dragons included.  Captain Picard and crew soon learn that interstellar trophy hunters have been raiding this planet as well.  Soon after beaming down to the planet, Picard, Riker, Data and Ro become embroiled in a web of intrigue and murder and are taken prisoner.  They must escape their captors and stop these interstellar hunters before they use their ancient weapon to destroy the Enterprise.<br />What follows from there is, as statedabove, one of the best written and intriguing numbered Star Trek titles to date.  I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of the genre!  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-10

Diane Duane is one of Star Trek's best and most celebrated authors.  She also has the distinction of being one of the most contradicted authors by later, &quot;on screen&quot; episodic canon; both in her version of the Romulans and in the mirror universe.  In a way though, her work stands on its own, in her own &quot;mirror universe&quot; of a sort in Star Trek fiction.<br />Capitalizing on The Original Series episode, &quot;Mirror, Mirror,&quot; &quot;Dark Mirror&quot; gave Star Trek readers something that many fans had been looking forward to for quite some time, a return to the mirror universe to see what happened after Captain Kirk's accidental but historic &quot;crossover.&quot;<br />Although I am a huge fan of Star Trek Deep Space Nine and from the very first episode in which they visited the mirror universe and the following shows once every year for the remainder of the series, in a way, I liked Diane Duane's version better.<br />The cover art for this hardback and paperback serves the novel quite well, showing the faces of the two, quite different, Captain Picard's.<br />The premise:<br />In one of Star Trek's darkest, yet most intriguing stories, author Diane Duane takes us back to mirror universe - I love the opening chapter of this novel in which the Enterprise is in interstellar space but they're between &quot;spiral arms&quot; in the galaxy where there are no stars and it seems to be having an effect on the crew.<br />Before long the crew finds themselves and the Enterprise having been dragged through the &quot;looking glass&quot; and they're now in the mirror universe where they soon learn that their doppelgangers are on a mission to replace them.  What is so interesting about this novel is their doppelgangers from the mirror universe and the complete twist in the characters, especially Deanna Troi and her extremely powerful mirror universe counterpart.<br />Captain Picard and crew find that in order to save the ship, themselves and the Federation from an all out invasion by their power hungry counterparts, they must infiltrate their ship on a mission of intelligence gathering and sabotage.<br />What follows from there is, as stated above, one of the most intriguing and alluring Star Trek stories to date, and in no small measure, deserved of the rare hardback version it was printed in.  I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of the genre and even more so if you can find the hardback version of it!<br />As a side note; the audio tape version, read by &quot;Q&quot; himself, John De Lancie, makes for an excellent three hour diversion while driving down the highway.  I've listened to this one more times than I can remember.  {ssintrepid}	2003-10-10

This particular novel even rated a video game being designed and named after it.<br />As with the departure from the norm that Star Trek Deep Space Nine is, so is this novel that is so much more different than any other novel written in any of the series. In one of the darkest and bloodiest &quot;hours&quot; of Star Trek, the author explores the idea of almost every main character in the series, being brutally murdered and how heroically they &quot;met their maker,&quot; yet the author, Dafydd ab Hugh, deftly handles closing up this novel in which there is no change whatsoever to the series.<br />&quot;Fallen Heroes&quot; is author Dafydd ab Hugh's first Star Trek novel and I found his writing style to be quite fluidic and the pacing of the novel to be non stop, which in the light of other Star Trek novels, is a great skill to possess. The cover art for this novel is standard fare for the time and doesn't lend much to the story.<br />The premise:<br />Set sometime early during the second season of the series, &quot;Fallen Heroes&quot; tells the tale of alien warriors coming to the station and demanding the return of an imprisoned comrade, someone of which nobody on the station knows anything about. Being set so early in the series, prior to the fourth season in which Deep Space Nine's defense were seriously &quot;beefed&quot; up, the aliens easily invade the station and Commander Sisko and crew have a losing battle to fight. Meanwhile, an odd device from the Gamma Quadrant has shifted Odo and Quark to three days in the future on the station. They arrive there and nobody is left alive, leaving them the task of finding a way back to the time they left and saving the station.<br />What follows from there, as stated above, is one of the most intriguing and fast paced early Star Trek Deep Space Nine novels setprior to the relaunch series. I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of the series as you will most certainly not be disappointed! {ssintrepid}	2003-10-10

This novelization for Star Trek The Next Generations six season closer and seventh season opener is a fairly decent one for her first try out at novelization in the Star Trek genre.  As with all novelizations, the point in reading them is for the &quot;between the scenes&quot; action and some character personalization that is simply not possible on the screen given time and budget constraints.  Diane Carey accomplishes that fairly well in this novelization!<br />The original story is by Star Trek author and later Star Trek Voyager Executive Producer, Jeri Taylor and the teleplay by Ronald D. Moore and Rene Echevarria.  When taken into comparison with the series other outstanding season ending cliffhangers and openers, I'd rate this one as dead last.  Although there were some fairly decent character moments in this story, the overall premise just didn't &quot;click&quot; with me too well.<br />The cover art for this novelization is fairly standard for the time it was published.<br />The premise:<br />Capitalizing on the past success of the episode &quot;I, Hugh,&quot; in which a lone Borg is found and nursed back to health after crash landing on a remote planet and then later returned to the Borg after he'd become an individual, Descent expounds on that basic premise.  The Enterprise is called to a station that is under attack, only to discover that the Borg have attacked it and are still there.  In what can be considered quite an amazing moment of Star Trek history, Data defends him and his crew mates and suddenly displays anger in a very large degree.<br />Captain Picard and crew now find themselves facing a new type of Borg that are using a different type of ship and are displaying individuality and an even more insidious character that they've had to deal with in the past and who is behind this latest Borg attack.<br />Overall, as stated above, in my opinion this was certainly not one of the better two part episodes that the producers put on screen.  Diane Carey does do a fairly decent job of sprucing up the story in this novelization.  {ssintrepid}ed above, in my opinion this was certainly not one of the better two part episodes that the producers put on screen.

This is somewhat sad as I found her writing style to be quite good and it would be very interesting to see her revisit the genre in any one of its many variants.<br />The cover art for &quot;Guises of the Mind&quot; is somewhat standard fare for the period in which it was released.<br />The premise:<br />Inspired by a quote from Sarek of Vulcan entailing mastery over emotions thus gaining peace through embracing the many guises of the mind, this author sets off to tell a different but extraordinarily intriguing STNG tale.<br />Capulon IV is a planet that has been waiting for several years to petition for membership in the Federation and they're finally ready.  In order to gain this membership the planets' new ruler must go through coronation and the signing of the final treaty.  The Enterprise is dispatched to Capulon IV with a group of women from a religious order dedicated to helping the downtrodden.  This group expects to be welcomed with open arms but they instead find deceit and treachery and the crown prince now refusing to join the Federation.<br />Captain Picard, Troi and Mother Veronica, the abbess of the nuns beam down to the planet in an attempt to determine the problem and work it out with crown prince.  They're soon drugged and captured though.  Captain Picard must now find a way to escape and stop the crown prince from being crowned as they soon learn that he will not only stop his planet from joining the Federation but he also intends to destroy the Enterprise.<br />What follows from there is one of the most intriguing STNG novels to date that explores areas of Gene Roddenberry's universe that are rarely visited but is done quite refreshingly in this novel.<br />I highly recommend this earlier Star Trek The Next Generation novel as it will make an excellent addition to your Star Trek library.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-25

Deep Space Nine #1 &quot;Emissary&quot; brings forth the beginning of Star Trek's best and most controversial series to the franchise.  I say controversial in that at times, this series whether when it was airing or on DVD and in print it seems to be treated as the red headed stepchild of Star Trek.  This doesn't matter though, because in the end, the very principles that make up Star Trek Deep Space Nine; its character conflicts and its dealing with certain aspects not dealt with on the other series ultimately makes it the most beloved by the fans that have stuck with it.<br />For several years now, when Pocket Books and Paramount have needed an author to novelize a script for one of the movies or television episodes, J.M. Dillard has been the &quot;go to&quot; author for most of them and she has performed brilliantly in every effort.  &quot;Emissary&quot; was her third novelization and one of her best.  She perfectly captured the characterizations at this pivotal time in the series, the beginning.<br />As with all of her other novelizations, she does an outstanding and commendable job of not only bringing to print what was on screen but adding personal thoughts to and &quot;between the scenes on screen&quot; scenes.<br />Of course, beyond the great amount of praise and credit for J.M. Dillard for this novelization there is an even higher amount of accolades due to Michael Piller for the teleplay and basic story being written by himself and Rick Berman.<br />The cover art for &quot;Emissary&quot; is right on for this particular novel as it displays an entire cast picture which at the time of this novelizations release was very helpful.<br />The premise:<br />&quot;Emissary&quot; is of course the novelization of Star Trek Deep Space Nine's pilot episode.  Here is where we meet the characters that will take us, the fans, through the entire gamut of emotions for several years to come.<br />Commander Benjamin Sisko who has been stationed on Earth since the tragic events of Wolf 359 in which his ship, the USS Saratoga, where he was serving on as first officer, participated in the defense of Earth from the Borg.  As with most starships on that dreadful day, the Saratoga was destroyed and Sisko was able to escape with his son Jake, but his wife, Jennifer lost her life.  As any man would, he's been suffering that loss since that day.  As he has accepted the command of Deep Space Nine, he's also considering leaving Starfleet.<br />With that catalyst in mind, &quot;Emissary&quot; begins with Commander Sisko's arrival and the arrival of the rest of the cast to include introductions to Major Kira Nerys, Odo and Quark.  Sisko also has a fateful meeting with Kai Opaka, the Bajoran spiritual leader.<br />What follows from there is nothing less than the best pilot episode of all of the series and one of J.M. Dillard's best novelizations.  I highly recommend this novelization for your Star Trek collection.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-21

With &quot;Grounded&quot; the author, David Bischoff came up with an exceptional premise but when it came to the execution of this premise the author's efforts seemingly fall flat.  When choosing a Star Trek novel from any of the particular series to read one generally believes that the author &quot;knows&quot; that series and the canon involved in it and if not, the editor will keep them on track.  This seemingly did not happen with &quot;Grounded&quot; which, did not entirely detract from the story itself but distracts the average fan of the episode.  I do not normally like picking apart a Star Trek novel for the minor inconsistencies with known canon that an author and editor have either forgotten or chosen to ignore; therefore I will only mention these aspects but not go into detail on each and every one of them in this review.<br />The cover art for grounded is actually one of the best covers to date, with the standard pictures of the primary characters for the story and some very good background art.<br />The premise:<br />The Enterprise answers a distress call from a remote science station.  The Enterprise herself soon becomes infected with a mysterious alien life form which starts feeding on her and transforming inorganic materials.  The great starship begins to disintegrate and Captain Picard is ordered to abandon her in the hopes of not infecting other ships.  Captain Picard and crew now find themselves in a race against time as they must find a way of saving the Enterprise before she is lost and the crew is scattered about the fleet to fill other positions.<br />While I wouldn't highly recommend this novel as one of the best stories in Star Trek fiction it is certainly not the worst of them and I would recommend it to complete ones library of Star Trek novels and as a mildly interesting early STNG novel.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-21

It is quite fitting that Peter David, one of Star Trek's most popular and prolific authors was given the opportunity to write the very first original Star Trek Deep Space Nine novel.  It's just too bad that he's only visited Deep Space Nine one time since this great novel.  <br />One of the most difficult problems that an author faces when writing a novel for such a young series is the fact that they just don't have much background to work with.  This is something that certainly hindered early STNG authors.  Peter David addresses this in the Preface of &quot;The Siege,&quot; stating that at the time he'd written this, he'd only seen the first five episodes so if the characterizations are off, that's why.  I believe that is one of the myriad of reasons that he has been on of the best Star Trek authors; you certainly didn't see any statements like this in the early STNG novels.<br />Although Peter David did not have a lot of Deep Space Nine background to work with, thematically the entire tone of this novel is &quot;dead on&quot; perfect with the first and second seasons.  As usual, his wit is in high gear with this novel, despite the &quot;heavy&quot; tone of the novel.<br />The cover art for &quot;The Siege&quot; is quite truly standard fare for the time in which this novel was released and not really too impressive.<br />The premise:<br />Commander Sisko is forced to cut back entry to the wormhole due to increased graviton emissions and not long thereafter the overall atmosphere of the station becomes very tense.  Suddenly an Edeman religious leader is but the first to be found murdered and Commander Sisko and Constable Odo must find the killer.  The killer is seemingly striking without motive and the situation soon becomes even more harrowing as the Cardassians and Edemans arrive demanding that the killer be found and given to them or else they'll destroy the station.  Adding a certain level of mystique in this story, Odo finds that he must destroy this killer butthe killer is also the only link to his mysterious past.<br />What follows from there is nothing less than a brilliant early Star Trek Deep Space Nine novel that will keep you guessing from cover to cover!  I highly recommend this novel for your Star Trek collection as you will find it to be among the best of any of the series.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-21

I found this author's writing style to be fairly good and the premise of this early Deep Space Nine story to be a sound one, however, the overall execution of the story more or less falls flat.  Despite the fact that this is but the third in the Star Trek Deep Space Nine fiction series and the author probably had but one season or less of episodes to base his characterizations on, his characterization for Major Kira Nerys just doesn't wash.  One would definitely think that if an author were going to set out to write a story in these series that they'd take an interest in learning the characters and failing that, the editor would catch these things and make corrections.  This just doesn't seem to be the case with this novel though.<br />The cover art for &quot;Bloodletter&quot; can be counted among the standard fare of Star Trek novels of the time where minimal effort was involved.<br />The premise:<br />As stated above, the premise is a fairly interesting one in which Starfleet Command has learned that the Cardassians are planning to construct a base on the other side of the wormhole in order to have a presence there and claim as much of the unexplored territory as possible.  Obviously this is well before the Dominion became a known factor!  The Federation has opted to preempt the Cardassians by having the command crew of Deep Space Nine build a station there first.  Coming from Major Kira's past though is a fanatic who will stop at nothing to destroy her, the fate of Bajor, the wormhole and possibly even the fate of the Federation.<br />While this novel is certainly not among the best of the Star Trek novels in print, it isn't the worst either.  I would recommend it to help complete your Star Trek Deep Space Nine collection and as a somewhat viable read.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-21

It is too bad that this author hasn't revisited the Star Trek genre since writing this particular novel.  I found her writing to be quite fluid and with a great sense of style in her plot setup and execution.  One of the more interesting aspects of this early STNG novel is the fact that she explored the personal dynamics between Worf and Troi, long before the actual series did.<br />The cover art for this particular novel is pretty much the standard fare for the earlier STNG novels in which a picture of the two primary characters for the novel are plastered on the cover.<br />The premise:<br />The planet Oriana has suffered through two hundred years of civil war and is now dying because of it.  Finally realizing what they have wrought for themselves, the two warring factions seek peace at the negotiation tables and the Federation is asked to mediate.  In comes Captain Picard and the Enterprise.  Captain Picard, Lieutenant Worf and Counselor Troi beam down to the planet to begin the negotiations.<br />Just as Captain Picard and his team begin negotiations the Enterprise is called away on another urgent mission.  Now alone on the planet, Captain Picard and his team must continue their negotiations for peace between the two warring factions but he is then accused of murder and Lieutenant Worf must continue the negotiations.<br />Worf and Troi now have to find a way of stopping the violence between the two warring factions to include those who do not wish for the negotiations to succeed and find a way of vindicating Captain Picard.<br />What follows from there is, as stated above, one of the better early STNG novels that I'd highly recommend adding to your Star Trek library.

The author, Simon Hawke most certainly deserves a great amount of praise for this particular gem.  What I find most surprising is that this was but the first of only three adventures into the Star Trek genre by this author.  I would've definitely thought he'd have been writing more.<br />The title of this novel alone drew me in when considering the nature of Romulans and their natural tendencies towards mystery, intrigue, treachery and deceit, all of which the author infused within this story with ease.  I found his writing style to be quite fluid, making for a very quick read as one is turning the pages as quickly as possible to get to the solution of this exceptional early STNG novel by one of Star Trek's &quot;not so&quot; prolific writers.<br />The cover art for this particular title a little bit better than the standard fare; showing Captain Picard, a Romulan, the Enterprise and a Romulan Warbird and the typical background of stars and planets.<br />The premise:<br />The Romulans learn of Hermeticus 2 which is a Federation planet that is so secret that even few in the Federation know of its existence.  This kind of adds a little bit of an Area 51 type mystique to the Star Trek universe.  The Romulans immediately formulate a plan to infiltrate this facility and here is where the Enterprise becomes involved.<br />As the Enterprise is on a routine patrol near the Romulan Neutral Zone, they discover an abandoned Romulan Warbird prototype that is very advance and lifeless.  Not long after, Captain Picard and crew begin an investigation of this abandoned Romulan vessel and they soon find themselves embroiled in a Romulan threat that threatens the very foundations of the Federation.<br />What follows from there is, as stated above, one of the best early STNG novels that will make an excellent addition to your Star Trek library and I highly recommendit.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-21

Star Trek The Next Generation &quot;Relics&quot; is the superb novelization of one of the most beloved episodes from the series spectacular sixth season.  The story and teleplay, written by Ron Moore deserves a high amount of praise as he found a wonderful way to write a modern STNG episode and bring &quot;Scotty&quot; forward into the twenty fourth century.<br />The decision to have Star Trek fiction's most prolific author, Michael Jan Friedman, write the novelization of this poignant episode was a perfect one.  &quot;Relics&quot; is his first novelization of an episode and, as he does with his original stories, he does a marvelous job.<br />As most novelizations go, the important part is adding a little bit more flavor to an already brilliant episode by bringing forth the characters thoughts and throwing in some &quot;between the scenes on the screen&quot; scenes.  All of which, Michael Jan Friedman does with perfection in &quot;Relics.&quot;<br />The cover art for &quot;Relics&quot; is, unfortunately, pretty much the standard fare for Star Trek novels with Scotty and LaForge pictures and the original Enterprise herself, which does add a little bit of &quot;something different&quot; to a Star Trek The Next Generation novel.<br />From the very first episode of Star Trek The Next Generation in which we saw an aged but still vital, one hundred and forty plus year old Dr. McCoy strolling down the hallways on the Enterprise NCC 1701-D with Data escorting him, many fans were wondering which, if any, characters from The Original Series would be making guest appearances.  With the fifth season episode &quot;Unification&quot; and Leonard Nimoy's exceptionally well written and performed return to Star Trek as Spock, the fans of the genre were satiated for the moment but still hungry for more.  I still vividly remember the barely containable excitement I experienced upon seeing the preview for the following weeks episode and seeing that James Doohan would be making a guest appearance and he would be bringing Scotty, one of Star Treks most beloved characters, into the twenty fourth century.  Now it was time for the &quot;how.&quot;<br />The premise:<br />Captain Picard and crew are headed to their latest mission when they receive a distress signal from the USS Jenolen which is a ship that has been reported missing for seventy five years.  Upon coming out of warp they also encounter gravimetric distortions.  As they move in they discover one of the most intriguing objects ever written into one of their episodes, a Dyson's Sphere.  The Dyson's Sphere is a real theoretical proposal, proposed by Freeman Dyson in which a civilization could harvest an astronomical amount of resources and build a sphere around a star and live within this sphere.<br />Captain Picard sends Riker, Worf and LaForge over to the Jenolen and they soon discover that the transporter has been locked into a diagnostic cycle and there's a pattern in the buffer.  LaForge runs the cycle through and standing there on the transporter pad is a Starfleet legend in one Captain Montgomery &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott!<br />As the story progresses, Scotty is suffering the anxiety of feeling obsolete and in the way as he tries to be helpful but only serves to annoy LaForge while he's attempting to carry out the mission given to him by Captain Picard.<br />What follows from there is not only one of the best episodes ever written and produced for the series but one of the best novelizations written within the Star Trek fiction genre.  For those that read Star Trek novels but don't bother too much with the novelizations, they should try this one as Michael Jan Friedman does a superb job with this story and I highly recommend this novel for your Star Trek library!  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-20

I found this particular early Star Trek The Next Generation novel to be quite interesting in its premise, plot and execution.  It is, quite unfortunately, the only Star Trek novel written by this author, lending one to the belief that it either didn't originally sell too well, or the author &quot;stepped up&quot; to the plate only this one time!  That is too bad, considering that T. L. Mancour did a wonderful job with the story.  It's not quite, five star material but it is certainly a very good early STNG story.<br />The cover art for this numbered novel is definitely among the better ones of the early Star Trek The Next Generation titles.<br />The premise:<br />The Enterprise answers a distress call and finds a disabled alien vessel known as the &quot;Freedom,&quot; which is crewed by a species known as the Vemlans.  The vessels captain, Jared asks for and receives very welcome help from Captain Picard and crew.  After the relief effort begins, they're interrupted by the arrival of an entire fleet of vessels from Vemla and they claim that Jared and his crew are escaped slaves and request that their property be turned over at once.  Reminiscent of one particular STNG episode and a later Star Trek Voyager episode, it turns out that Jared and his crew are Androids, which prominently brings Commander Datas' involvement into the story.<br />Here is where this novel stands outs, as of course, Jared and his crew request asylum with Captain Picard and the Enterprise.  The author plays this out very well as Captain Picard wrestles; not only with his personal convictions but with the Prime Directive as the Vemlan fleet is threatening the destruction of the Enterprise if they do not return the slaves and his decision &quot;must&quot; be made.<br />What follows is certainly, as stated above, one of the better early STNG novels that makes an excellent addition to your Star Trek library and I'd definitely recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction!  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-14

It is too bad that this author hasn't visited either the twenty third or twenty fourth centuries in quite some time, because they did some fairly decent work.  As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, this one definitely has a very slow paced beginning to it but that is soon worked out as the plot turns from a plodding setup into a well paced conclusion.<br />Capitalizing on the Star Trek The Next Generation first season episode, &quot;The Big Goodbye,&quot; the author brings forth some non canon knowledge of the Jaradan race which was never actually seen in the episode.  This too was unfortunate as I've always found insectoid races to be an interesting aspect in the Star Trek universe but one that is only practically used in the novels but given the latest technology, we're now able to see them, such as one of the species of Xindi in the third season opener of Enterprise, &quot;The Expanse.&quot;<br />As cover art goes, this early STNG novel has fairly decent cover art but it's nothing too spectacular.  Of note though is that the images of Riker and Crusher are &quot;realistic,&quot; unlike the cartoon like covers of old.<br />The premise:<br />The Enterprise is ordered to Jarada to negotiate an exchange of Ambassadors when the Jarada, a mysterious race of insectoid beings that possess an extreme devotion to protocol seemingly come out of their reclusive nature and offer to open diplomatic relations.  Upon arrival at Jarada, Captain Picard and crew suddenly find that the Jarada are being uncharacteristically friendly.  Without preamble, the Jarada change their demeanor and Commander Riker and the rest of his away team are cut off from the Enterprise.  At the same time, the Jarada attack the Enterprise.<br />What follows from there is, as stated above, a slow starter that has a well paced finished as Picard must find a way to rescue his away teamand salvage any hopes of a diplomatic relationship with the Jarada.<br />I'd definitely recommend this early STNG novel as it makes an excellent addition to your Star Trek library.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-14

This early Star Trek The Next Generation numbered novel can certainly be counted among the best.  This is also the only novel by these two authors, W.A. McCay and E.L. Flood, which is too bad considering that with this early STNG novel, they set up an intriguing, well paced plot and carried it through to fruition quite nicely, which was somewhat rare with the earlier STNG numbered novels.<br />As cover art goes, for the early Star Trek The Next Generation novels, this is a decent but not too remarkable one, although it is among the rare ones with Dr. Beverly Crusher on it.<br />The premise:<br />The Enterprise is exploring a remote and devastated group of Class M (Munshara) planets when they receive a distress call from a group of what they find to be human slaves on a remote and quite forbidding glacial planet.  When the slaves revolt, Captain Picard is unable to help them but they succeed despite the lack of Federation assistance.  With the revolt over and the overseers successfully put down, Captain Picard and the slaves soon learn that the true controllers are coming to reclaim their property.<br />What follows is an extremely interesting and well told story, to include an Avian type race.  I'd definitely recommend this particular early STNG novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction as it will make an excellent addition to your Star Trek library.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-14

From early experiences with John Vornholt and his excellent writing style that is so very fluid, one learns that one of his novels are to be looked forward to with great anticipation.  &quot;War Drums&quot; is no exception to that general rule.  If I were to rank the early Star Trek The Next Generation novels, up to the release date of &quot;War Drums,&quot; I'd definitely have to rank it in the top five.<br />As is true with all of his novels, John Vornholt uses a very fluid writing style and instills in his novels very realistic characterizations, not only for the primary characters but for the &quot;guest&quot; characters.  Along with the excellent characterizations, his plot, plot devices and surprises with the story makes his stories very memorable.  As is his usual style, he also sets the surrounding world up with perfection; when he takes you to an alien environment, he describes it clearly and concisely, making you, the reader, feel as if you're there with the characters.<br />What makes this novel so intriguing is that it's a Worf story and adding to that is Ro Laren.  Both characters of which, at the time of this exceptional novels release, hadn't received too many stories, making this novel that much more valuable to fans of these characters.<br />The author also does a great job of exploring some of the Klingon culture in this novel, which to most fans is a true delight, considering the enormously popular nature of all things Klingon.<br />The cover art for War Drums is good but typical of most early Star Trek novels, where you basically have portraits of one or two of the main characters of the story and a somewhat interesting background.<br />The premise:<br />The planet Selva is a lush colony world that has been settled by a group of humans.  Unbeknownst to them when they settled on the planet, it had already been &quot;settled&quot; by a group of young Klingons.  When violence erupts between the two groups, the Enterprise is called in hopes of rendering assistance and stopping the violence.<br />Upon her arrival, the Enterprise is called away on another urgent mission.  Captain Picard leaves Worf, Troi, Data and Ro Laren behind as an away team.  Worf and the rest of the away team soon find that the old hatreds between humans and Klingons exists in abundance on this planet and they must soon find a way to stop the violence before it turns into an all out war.  Adding to that mix is a particularly intriguing third party!<br />What follows is what I found to certainly be one of the best early STNG novels and I'd highly recommend this novel as it will make an excellent addition to your Star Trek library.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-14
US	52712162	RSIYS2XLM4PIM	0743485114	845923455	Star Trek: Pantheon, Signature Edition (Star Trek: The Original Series)	Books	5	14	16	N	Y	Star Trek Pantheon - A beautiful &quot;Signature Edition&quot;	In this beautifully crafted trade paperback, Pocket Books and Michael Jan Friedman have combined two of his best stories to date; &quot;Reunion&quot; and &quot;The Valiant.&quot;  Both stories are grounded in Michael Jan Friedman's Stargazer series, but when they were originally released, they were released as Star Trek The Next Generation stories as the publisher had not yet decided upon a &quot;spin off&quot; of sorts.<br />As an added bonus to this magnificent edition, Michael Jan Friedman has written a wonderful introduction and at the end of the book there is a particularly interesting interview with him done by Kevin Dilmore.<br />As I've seen and read on various Star Trek websites, some have complained about the cover art for this &quot;Signature Edition.&quot;  This is something that I do not agree with; the cover art is perfect as this novel and these stories are here to give us the fans, the stories from Captain Picard's past, during his time as the Captain of the USS Stargazer.  The title is tremendously intriguing and well chosen as well, &quot;Pantheon,&quot; as is defined by Webster's College Dictionary and most applicable here is, &quot;the realm of the heroes or idols of any group,&quot; <br />It is also quite appropriate that Michael Jan Friedman and these two stories have been the first release of a &quot;Signature Edition&quot; trade paperback when taking into account that &quot;Reunion&quot; was the first Star Trek The Next Generation hardback as well.<br />I really like the way in which they constructed this novel as well.  As opposed to just slapping the two novels in, back to back, the author and editor have &quot;somewhat&quot; intertwined the two stories, between the prologue and epilogue.<br />The premise:<br />Reunion -<br />Here is where the authors brilliance stands out as he not only created a murder/mystery story in the Star Trek genre but he did it while at the same time, created a crew for the USS Stargazer, which is the ship commanded by Captain Jen Luc Picard for twenty two years, long before there were any considerations of another ship by another name.  Capitalizing on the very little information provided by the STNG episode &quot;The Battle,&quot; he expounded upon that tidbit of information and came up with a first-rate supporting cast for Captain Picard in his formative years as a Starfleet Captain.<br />Not only does he do an astonishing job of creating the crew for the Stargazer, he superbly brings together a plot involving the present day USS Enterprise and her characters and the characters from the Stargazer.  Overall, this is an exceptional story that &quot;shouldn't&quot; be missed by Star Trek fiction readers.<br />The Valiant -<br />In the beginning of this exceptional story, we're taken some three hundred years into Starfleet history to when the SS Valiant is thrown beyond the galactic barrier and is trying to make her way back home through the galactic barrier.  The SS Valiant is first mentioned in The Original Series episode &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before.&quot;  Unfortunately for Captain Tarasco, who captain's the SS Valiant; their failed attempt to cross the barrier results in several casualties and in particular one crewman begins to exhibit &quot;godlike&quot; powers and loses all compassion for human life, thinking of his fellow humans more as bugs than his equals.  This leaves Captain Tarasco with few options.<br />USS Stargazer<br />The Stargazer, captained by Captain Ruhalter with Commander Jean Luc Picard as second officer is summoned to Starbase 209.  Upon arrival, they receive their mission briefing which encompasses two &quot;descendants&quot; of the SS Valiant who claim that they're ancestors, some three hundred years ago were the crew of the Valiant and they &quot;did&quot; survive to form a colony on the other side of the barrier.  These two descendants bring with them warnings of an invasion into Federation territory by a species that lives on the other side of the galactic barrier known and the Nuyyad.<br />With plenty of skepticism to spare, the Captain and crew of the USS Stargazer head out for the galactic barrier with one of the descendants on board and a Kelvan advisor aboard to determine the truth in this warning and hopefully deal with it accordingly.<br />What follows is an exceptional story detailing the events surrounding how Commander Jean Luc Picard became Captain Picard, in command of the USS Stargazer.  Along with this, one of the better aspects of the story is that it sets up the events in \\"Reunion\\" with reference to his Chief Medical Officer Carter Greyhorse.<br />I highly recommend this Signature Series edition and reprint of two of author Michael Jan Friedman's better stories.  This trade paperback will make an excellent addition to your Star Trek library and at its minimal price won't set you back too far.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-14

From her first Star Trek novelization, &quot;Star Trek V The Final Frontier,&quot; J.M. Dillard has been the &quot;go to&quot; author for Pocket Books when it comes to the novelizations for the movies and the novelization of Star Trek Deep Space Nines pilot episode, &quot;Emissary.&quot;  This is deservedly so, her work in the novelizations of such important events in the Star Trek genre have been exceptional, and this novel is no exception to that rule.<br />&quot;Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country&quot; as a film was an extremely well told story written by Leonard Nimoy, Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal, with the screenplay being written by Nicholas Meyer and Denny Martin Flinn.  J.M. Dillard's work in this extraordinary novel not only serves to novelize that original story, it enhances it beyond measure.  She does a beautiful job of adding the characters personal thoughts of the events surrounding them and of adding to the story with &quot;between the scenes&quot; sequences that makes this one of her best efforts.<br />The premise:<br />The Klingons, having been long time rivals of the Federation whether through open war or unbridled skirmishes have suffered a great catastrophe when Praxis, A Klingon moon suddenly explodes, removing a key energy resource center for the Klingon Empire.  Suddenly finding themselves facing too many problems, more or less of their own creation, in which they've spent too much on their military budget and not enough on environmental and other concerns, the Klingon Chancellor, Gorkon must make a decision to sue for peace between the Empire and the Federation.<br />The main catalyst for that peace turns out to be Captain Spock, who has been working in secret negotiations with Chancellor Gorkon and is now ready to begin those talks in earnest.  Spock has managed to secure the use of the Enterprise and Captain Kirk in order to rendezvous with Chancellor Gorkon and escort his ship back to Earth to begin those negotiations.<br />Here is where the writing of the screenplay and J.M. Dillard's writing kicks into the high gear of intrigue when a conspiracy uncovers itself long enough to fire several torpedoes from the Enterprise and hit Chancellor Gorkon's ship, knocking out their gravity and then two conspirators beam over and murder Chancellor Gorkon and several other Klingons.  Captain Kirk and Doctor McCoy both beam over, hoping to be able to help Chancellor Gorkon, but he dies and they're charged with his murder.<br />What follows from there is nothing less than one of the best stories written in the Star Trek genre and filmed, to date.  From political intrigue and an extraordinary space battle to some very humorous moments, &quot;Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country&quot; hits on all points.<br />I highly recommend this novelization as it is an excellent addition to your Star Trek library whether you're into the novelizations or not.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-13

Of all of Tom Clancy's novels that I've either read or reread, I would think it would be difficult to sit back and say, this novel or that one is the best of them, but if forced to choose, I'd say that &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; is the best one.  Contained within the pages of this novel is some of the most fluid writing that one can find in a novel from this genre.  From taut political intrigue to suspenseful military action this novel scores in every area.<br />The particularly great thing that one can anticipate and not be disappointed in when contemplating a Clancy novel, is that he covers all of the bases and leave nothing out.  The scope and detail that Clancy worked into this novel is mind boggling as he sets up so many variables and then works you through to the conclusion of every one of those variables.<br />&quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; is author Tom Clancy's fourth novel overall and more importantly, the third in his &quot;Ryanverse.&quot;  One of the more important things about reading a Clancy novel is the fact that he seems to have set things up for himself rather nicely because you will find &quot;possible&quot; hints at where he's going with either his next book or one down the road.  You will find references to the Cardinal, throughout his previous books as well as other references in his earlier novels that are leading to his later novels.<br />Taut political intriguing + suspenseful military action + in depth characterizations + a plot of epic proportion = &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin.&quot;<br />The premise:<br />&quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; is so large in its scope and detail that it may be difficult to summarize the plot here, in so few words available.<br />What drives this novel, first and foremost, is Dr. Jack Ryan who is by the release of this novel the well known lead character from &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; and &quot;Patriot Games.&quot;  As the novel begins, we find that Dr. Ryan is stillworking as an analyst for the CIA's DDI, Deputy Director of Intelligence.  He's presently trying to work up a paper based the current negotiations between the United States and the USSR on ICBM's.<br />We're then taken to the &quot;Archer&quot; who is an Afghanistan resistance fighter and part of the mudjaheddin.  Due to what the Soviets have done to him and his family, he has no love lost for them, they even captured his son and taken him to the Soviet Union for &quot;reeducation,&quot; hence his intense desire to fight and kill as many Soviets as he can.<br />From there we're introduced to the &quot;Cardinal&quot; of the Kremlin, Misha Filitov who is a Colonel in the Soviet Army and a three time Hero of the Soviet Union from his days as a tank commander in the Great War.  Hinted at in previous Clancy novels, this Colonel has been disillusioned by the way of life in the Soviet Union which has caused the death of his wife and his son, hence his having been turned by American agents.  In his present position with the Defense Ministry, he has been passing Soviets secrets to the Americans for thirty years.<br />What follows from there is one of author; Tom Clancy's most intriguing and entertaining novels to date that will have you, the reader, turning the pages voraciously trying to get to the end of it to see how it ends.  The scope and detail of this novel is simply incredible.<br />I highly recommend not only this Clancy novel but all of his novels for he is truly the master of this genre.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-13

Unification is the novelization of Star Trek The Next Generation's outstanding fifth season episodes &quot;Unification, parts one and two,&quot; guest starring Leonard Nimoy as Spock, in a long awaited reappearance of a Star Trek The Original Series cast member in the twenty fourth century incarnation.<br />The &quot;Unification&quot; novelization is also the first published story by Jeri Taylor who later wrote Voyager's &quot;Mosaic&quot; and &quot;Pathways.&quot;  Having been a screenwriter, producer and executive producer between the two shows, she &quot;truly&quot; knows the characters and her depth of character knowledge plays out extraordinarily well in this novelization.  <br />Credit for this novelization also goes to those who originated the story idea; Rick Berman and Michael Piller, with the part one teleplay being written by Jeri Taylor and part two written by Michael Piller.<br />The premise:<br />In this exciting and extraordinarily gratifying STNG tale the Federation learns that Ambassador Spock has disappeared and they receive evidence that he is now on Romulus.  Fearing a betrayal of this magnitude, Starfleet sends Captain Picard on a mission to find Spock and bring him home to the Federation.  They believe that he is the most capable person for this mission based on his brief but terribly poignant friendship with Spock's father, Sarek.<br />As the story unfolds, you will find that this novelization is even more captivating than the two part episode, given the author's opportunity to add a few things here and there that the shows producers weren't able to squeeze in.  Considering that this novelization was written by Jeri Taylor, in some ways, the entirety of this novel should be considered canon in the Star Trek universe.<br />I highly recommend this novel as it is very true to the ethos that is Star Trek, making it a very enjoyable read!  {ssintrepid	2003-09-07

If you've read many of the earlier Star Trek The Next Generation novels to include Peter David's work, you will have found that his stories are among the most intriguing, hilarious and captivating among them.  &quot;Q-In-Law&quot; is no exception to that and, in fact, this particular novel is a step above his already high standard of writing.  Few of Star Trek's authors' capture the characters as well as Peter David does and even fewer are capable of dignified comedy with the characters as Peter David is.<br />The premise:<br />The Enterprise is chosen as the site for a wedding between two powerful but rivaled families of the space faring merchant raced called the Tizarin.  As is custom, Captain Picard is quite happy to be hosting the wedding right up to the point in which the Federation delegate from Betazed shows up, Lwaxana Troi.<br />Captain Picard now finds himself attempting to dodge the romantic overtures from Lwaxana Troi and still run his ship.  Everything seems to be going smoothly until Q shows up to examine the human concept of love.  Everything seems to fall apart from there.  Q's experiment in love with Lwaxana Troi turns haywire on him and from there you will find that you're reading one of the most hilarious and engrossing early STNG novels!<br />The Audio Tape:<br />As an added bonus, this particularly great story was produced as an audio book as well!  It is made even better having been read by Majel Barrett and John de Lancie themselves.  This audio book is certainly a great way to spend three hours on the highway!<br />I highly recommend this novel and the audio tape to any and all fans of Star Trek as they're both extraordinarily entertaining!  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-07

Data, Troi and young Wesley Crusher launch in a shuttle to the planet but are captured by Tenirans, who have claimed the planet for themselves.  While attempting to negotiate for the release of his crew, Captain Picard himself disappears, quite spectacularly.  He suddenly finds himself on the planets surface with the Tenarin captain.  They both soon realize that they must work together as they find that they're not alone on the planet.<br />What follows from there is an engaging story that I found to be a quick Star Trek read.

Star Trek The Next Generation #16 Contamination is John Vornholt's second Star Trek novel and though it's not his best work in the Star Trek genre, it's still a pretty good book and well worth the time to read!  Once you get used to his writing style, you will find it be fairly fluid, in his \\"own\\" way.<br />Of interest in this particular novel is the premise of murder on the Enterprise, something of which is not supposed to happen in the twenty fourth century which lends heavily to the shock factor among the Captain and crew.  John Vornholt deals with the issue fairly well throughout the book, delivering another good Star Trek novel.<br />The premise:<br />The crew of the Enterprise is quite shocked to find that a famous scientist named Lynn Costa who was visiting the ship is murdered.  Captain Picard must see justice done so he assigns the task of discovering the murderer to Lieutenant Worf and Counselor Deanna Troi.  Our erstwhile heroes soon find themselves embroiled in a web of deceit and betrayal all while an assassin is aboard the Enterprise...<br />I highly recommend this novel to any and all Star Trek fiction fans who are interested in reading a fairly well written Star Trek story by one of Star Trek's top ten authors.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-02

This is one of only two original Star Trek stories written by author Mel Gilden, which is kind of a shame because I found this story to be a fairly well written one.  Had Mel Gilden explored farther into the Star Trek universe I'm sure he would've written several more \\"well told\\" Star Trek tales.<br />The premise:<br />As with what often happened to young Mr. Wesley Crusher, his science experiment has gone bad and it causes serious trouble aboard the USS Enterprise.  Add that and a visit from a long time friend of Captain Picard's in Eric Baldwin who is the Federation's premier exologist and a very strange alien race and you have a well thought out plot that will keep you reading through this novel at a good pace.<br />Albeit one of the shorter Star Trek The Next Generation novels, I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek novels for in it you will find a well paced and thought out plot and some dead on characterizations.  It is truly too bad that the author hasn't written anymore stories in Gene Roddenberry's universe.  {ssintrepid	2003-09-02

After reading one or two Peter David novels, one quickly learns that his novels are to be looked forward to with great anticipation.  Vendetta is no exception to this rule as it is an outstanding story that makes one wonder why it wasn't published as a hardback.  Of course, at the time of this exceptional novels release, Star Trek The Next Generation stories hadn't quite made it to hardback status yet.<br />What can one expect from a Peter David Star Trek novel?  An intriguing and exceptional plot; extraordinary humor; writing that is very true to characters; and so much more, all of which is delivered in this novel.<br />The premise:<br />The Enterprise answers a distress call from a planet that is under attack by the Borg.  Rushing in, they discover a lone survivor named Delcara.  Delcara is thoroughly outraged by the atrocity she bore witness to and sets herself on the path of revenge.  Seeking to completely destroy the Borg for their crime against her people and others, she sets out to find a Doomsday Machine.  When Captain Picard and crew learn of her intentions they must find a way to stop her because they \\"know\\" that the Doomsday Machine will not stop with the Borg...<br />What follows from there is as stated above, one of Peter David's earliest Star Trek stories and one of his best from that timeframe.  I'd definitely have to say that the most hilarious part of this story is a Ferengi Damon being assimilated by the Borg to fill a role much similar to what they did to Picard when they assimilated him into Locutus.<br />I would definitely recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek fiction and especially to Peter David fans; it is definitely not to be missed.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-02

From Harold Coyle's first novel \\"Team Yankee,\\" we learned that he could write extraordinarily well while threading much of his work around what was doctrine, at that time, against the ever present threat of a Soviet Union that was perceived to be bent on world domination.  Fortunately, history proved this \\"threat\\" to have been a misperception. <br />With \\"Sword Point,\\" Harold Coyle proved that one, \\"Team Yankee\\" wasn't a fluke and two, that he was capable of even more depth in his story and that he is quite capable of delivering the \\"punch\\" in the story at the right time.  This is why, when I wish to read a story involving mostly ground warfare and the people that must fight it, I look forward to a novel written by Harold Coyle.  Although I truly do enjoy a Clancy novel in which he goes through all of the political machinations before during and after the fighting starts, what I truly like about Coyle's novels is that he doesn't spend too much time on that aspect and goes straight into the battles and the people behind those battles.<br />From the Foreword, through twenty one chapters and the Epilogue, Harold Coyle placed a hauntingly poignant and quite relevant quote for that chapter, from Karl Von Clausewitz to Arthur Wellesley, each quote is \\"dead on\\" appropriate to that chapter.  Also of great importance to this novel and for the likes of those from Publishers Weekly who didn't quite understand what was happening in this novel, is a brief description of the graphics and overlays used by the military and a glossary to help with some of the more common terminology used in the military. <br />The premise:<br />This is a story put to paper prior to the fall of the \\"iron curtain\\" that is told, with frightening clarity, of what could possibly have happened if during the later years of the cold war, the USSR had decided that a play for the Straight of Hormuz and Iran's oil fields would've been worth risking, turning the cold war into a very hot one.<br />It is the predawn hours of May 25th in the Armenian province of the Soviet Socialist Republic and a Soviet Armored column makes an easy break across the border into Iran.  They're headed straight for Tehran and further to the Straight of Hormuz, their mission; secure the country by removing those in power in Tehran and gaining control of the Arab nation's oil fields and reserves.<br />The Politburo knows that the Iranians do not have the military power to stop them and doesn't believe the Americans will get involved.  They're of course wrong as the United States immediately begins to mobilize its forces and heads for Iran in order to stop the USSR from gaining control of this key territory and destabilizing the oil industry.<br />Along with the threat of the USSR gaining complete control of this key strategic area and the implied possibility that they might use chemical weapons against American and allied forces there is the very real threat that the Iranians, being besieged by both the greater Satan Americans who are there to \\"help\\" them, and the lesser Satan Soviets, is the threat that they have a crude nuclear device that they wish to attempt to start world war three with.<br />I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of this genre!  It is truly a classic in the military/political genre.  I myself have been in the Army for several years and have read many of the same training and doctrine treatises that Harold Coyle used as a basis for this story and I am thoroughly impressed by his ability to take these training and doctrine manuals and turn them into such a compelling and intriguing tale of modern warfare.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-01

Michael Jan Friedman, Star Trek's most prolific author proffers up this early Star Trek The Next Generation tale in the form of a detective/mystery novel.  At the core, most Star Trek novels and episodes are a mystery; here's the problem, Captain and crew \\"must\\" solve the mystery in order to bring everything back into order etc...  The difference here is that the author has straight written a detective/mystery novel which is an unusual but welcomed change in the Star Trek novel universe.<br />The premise:<br />Dante Maxima Seven is a world to which the indigenous humanoids are known as the Imprima and they are controlled by a small but extraordinarily wealthy group known as the Madragi.  Several years earlier, Riker was among the first delegation of Federation representatives that conducted first contact with the inhabitants of this world.  This was also when he befriended Teller Conlon, who was also a member of that team.  Now, years later, a priceless treasure known as Fortune's Light, which belonged to Madraga Criathis has been stolen and Riker's friend, Teller Conlon has been accused of this theft.<br />What follows from there is interesting, but unfortunately not too terribly intriguing mystery novel in which Riker must discover the truth behind the theft of Fortune's Light and by doing so hopefully clear his friends name.  At the same time there is an interesting sub plot in which Data has discovered baseball in the holodeck.<br />I would recommend this early Star Trek The Next Generation novel to any and all fans of Star Trek novels more as a collectors/completists novelty than anything else.  {ssintrepid}	2003-09-01

Howard Weinstein is one of Star Trek's early and better authors.  In \\"Exiles\\" he sets up a plot that is in every way true to Roddenberry's theme behind Star Trek and its dealing with moral issues in the future.  Unfortunately, in \\"Exiles\\" despite having a grand theme and plot, its execution is somewhat lacking.  Had this story been written later in Star Trek The Next Generation's run on television, the author might've had a little more to work with in reference to character development and the overall \\"atmosphere\\" of the series.<br />The premise:<br />For three hundred years the people of Alaj and Etolos have been bitter enemies, wishing nothing to do with each other.  Disasters strike both worlds leaving them both dependent upon each other in the hopes of survival and a future.  Called in as a third party negotiator, Captain Picard and crew must find a way to peacefully settle the issues between these two worlds and rescue as many people as possible.  They're soon plagued by terrorists who do not wish to change from the old ways.<br />What follows is an intriguing yet unfortunately not too entertaining early STNG story that despite high praise from Gene Roddenberry himself, doesn't live up to its potential.<br />I recommend this Star Trek tale as collector's addition to their Star Trek library!  {ssintrepid}	2003-08-24

For once, thank you very much to the Amazon.com recommendations for if it weren't for that I might never have heard of this incredible author and his work.  \\"Voyage of the Devilfish,\\" as stated above, is a high speed, low drag submarine thriller that will have you voraciously turning the pages, hungry for more!  This being his first novel, I found his writing to be quite thorough but sticking to the plot without going into too much detail, well paced and quite fluid.  Being a former submariner himself, you could discern the authenticity of his knowledge of that world that so few \\"actually\\" know about.<br />Of all of the writers in this particular genre of fiction, I found Michael DiMercurio's style to be among the best and am quite happy to have discovered his novels.  So few authors in this genre can actually say that \\"they've been there and done that\\" which, paired with his superb writing style makes for an excellent read!  It is interesting to see that the author decided to use the Sturgeon class American submarine but for the purposes of the novel he renamed it the Piranha class.  There's that and his obvious disdain for the earliest Los Angeles class submarines which weren't nearly as capable of the many roles it is today or of those of the Sturgeon class submarine.<br />The premise:<br />Prologue -<br />Several years prior to the main events of this outstanding novel, the USS Stingray, captained by Commander \\"Patch\\" Pacino is under the polar icecap trailing a brand new Soviet submarine, NATO codenamed the Akula class.  This Soviet Akula class submarine, the Leningrad is captained by Captain 1st Rank Alexi Novskoyy.  Captain Novskoyy has decided that he is going to avenge the loss of the Kiev which collided with an American submarine four months earlier and it went to the bottom with all hands lost and he orders a warshot torpedo on the USS Stingray.  The Stingray and its commanding officer, \\"Patch\\" Pacino is sunk!  Back at the Naval Academy, Pacino's son Michael is attending his first year as a plebe and has no idea what has happened to his father.<br />Over two decades later -<br />Commander Michael Pacino is now in command of the USS Devilfish, still dealing with the demons from the mysterious loss of his father and his ship and struggling to maintain his marriage while at the same time commanding a nuclear attack submarine.  At the same time, Captain Novskoyy is now Admiral Novskoyy, Supreme Commander, Russian Republic Northern Fleet.  He's been working for several years on the design and construction of a super submarine known as the Kaliningrad and it is prepared to take its maiden voyage.  A treaty between the Russians and the United States in which all submarine launched nuclear weapons are to be destroyed has been carried out.  He doesn't believe the Americans are going to do this so he puts into place a plan that he believes will force them to do so...<br />Before you know it, the Kaliningrad is heading for the polar icecap, the USS Devilfish is headed for the Kaliningrad while at the same time, some eighty different Russian submarines are headed for the eastern coast of the United States, rushing to achieve cruise missile launching points.<br />What follows from there is one of the most captivating, intriguing and compelling underwater and political thrillers that I've ever read!  I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of this genre!  {ssintrepid}	2003-08-22

After seeing this particular title and Patrick Robinson's other titles in the stores last year I decided to purchase them all based on the back cover descriptions.  Prior to reading \\"Nimitz Class,\\" I decided to check the other reviews to see how well the book was received and was somewhat disappointed to see that the majority of the reviews didn't hold this title in a particularly favorable light.  With this in mind, I opened the front cover and dove in!  <br />Much to my surprise and delight \\"Nimitz Class\\" is a well told Naval/Political thriller that is extraordinarily intriguing, the majority of the characters are compelling and the pacing of the novel is dead on accurate.  As to whether Patrick Robinson is a new Tom Clancy, I'm not sure about that but he certainly holds his own in \\"Nimitz Class\\" and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of his novels.<br />At the very core of most successful writers list of Political/Military novels is a strong set of recurring characters.  With \\"Nimitz Class\\" Patrick Robinson has set the stage for his characters such as Vice Admiral Arnold Morgan, Director, National Security Agency who is the spitting image of someone in his position, gruff in a good natured sort of way, tough as nails and extraordinarily intelligent.  <br />The premise:<br />Deep in the Indian Ocean lies an American CVBG, Carrier Battle Group, a twelve warship group centered on the Nimitz class aircraft carrier, the USS Thomas Jefferson.  She is on routine patrol after successfully engaging in war games with another carrier battle group.  Suddenly several of the outlying ships take a massive airburst and huge waves, nearly capsizing a couple of the ships.  Once everything settles down and the captain of the USS Arkansas regains command and control he attempts to make contact with every ship in the battle group.  The main player in the group, the aircraft carrier can neither be reached through communications nor seen on radar.  He immediately takes his ship tothe carriers last known position only to find a high level of radiation and a couple of the ships that were close to her badly damaged.  A US aircraft carrier and the six thousand men and women aboard are gone...<br />In comes the main players of the novel as the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Scott Dunsmore is notified who then takes it up to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Joshua Paul and then on the President.  A meeting is called to discuss what happened or what might've happened to the carrier.  The Director of the National Security Agency, Arnold Morgan and a young Naval Intelligence officer, Lieutenant Commander Bill Baldridge whose brother just happened to have been the Captain of the USS Thomas Jefferson.  While the general consensus is that this was somehow an accident aboard the aircraft carrier, Bill Baldridge, a nuclear expert explains otherwise and leads them down the path of discovery...<br />What follows is nothing short of an outstanding Naval/Political thriller that is a true page turner.  At times, some of the text is somewhat clipped and the technical terminology is off a bit, both of which can be easily overlooked in the overall light of the plot which is thoroughly captivating.  I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of this genre!  {ssintrepid}	2003-08-18

After reading the previous reviews of this particularly intriguing collection of DragonLance tales I felt that it might be a waste of time to read through them.  Having that thought in mind, I dove in anyway.  Having now finished this first tales novel, which of course follows the theme of magic, I can definitely say that it was well worth the time to read.  Granted, the leading story, a poem about Riverwind the Plainsman wasn't all that intriguing and a couple of the other stories weren't real page turners.  Overall though, I would definitely recommend this book of tales to any DragonLance fan, especially for the final story, \\"Legacy\\" which serves quite well in furthering the grand DragonLance epic begun by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman.<br />DragonLance Tales Volume I<br />Riverwind and the Crystal Staff by Michael Williams ** - This is the story of Riverwind and his quest to find the staff that plays such and important role in \\"The Dragons of Autumn Twilight.\\"  Some may find a tale told in the form of a poem fascinating, unfortunately I'm not among them and I found myself trying to get through this as quickly as possible to get to the rest of the tales.<br />The Blood Sea Monster by Barbara and Scott Siegel **** - This is a fairly well written tale of a young and mischievous elf who steels away aboard a fisherman's boat, only to be found by the fisherman.  Upon their fateful meeting, the young elf strikes a bargain with the old fisherman in the hopes of profit.  After they've set off though, the old man has a terrifying surprise for the elf.<br />A Stone's Throw Away by Roger E. Moore ***** - I cannot give enough praise to the author for this wonderfully well written tale of Tasslehoff Burrfoot and his run in with a powerful wizard.  It seems that one of those stories he kept telling everybody during \\"Chronicles\\" and \\"Legends\\" wasn't too tall a tale after all!<br />Dreams of Darkness, Dreams of Light by Warren B. Smith ***** - In this exceptionally well writtentale, the author reintroduces us to Pig Faced William Sweetwater, the owner of the Pig and Whistle in Port Balifor which was the bar the Heroes of the Lance stayed in and earned the money to move on in their quest.<br />Love and Ale - by Nick O'Donohoe *** - This a story of Otik and a young Tika Waylan, running The Inn of the Last Home, well prior to the events in the \\"Chronicles\\" and the things that can go wrong when there is a Kender involved.  While the premise of this tale is well thought out, the story dragged way too much and seemed to be bogged down in the details.<br />Wayward Children by Richard A. Knaak ***** - This is another of the stories in Tales Volume I that cannot receive enough praise as this exceptional author puts us, the readers, in the eyes of the enemy, the Draconians and their strange encounter with a village of elderly elves.<br />The Test of the Twins by Margaret Weis ***** - Co-DragonLance creator Margaret Weis does her usual high standard of work in this tale that gives us the back story of Par-Salian's decision to invite Raistlin to take the test and what happened when Caramon and Raistlin traveled to the Tower of High Sorcery in Wayreth.<br />Harvests by Nancy Varian Berberick ***** - Given the number of DragonLance novels written by this exceptional author, it's easy to see why she has written so many.  This is a well constructed and thought out short story about a Tanis and Flint adventure that happened prior to the events of \\"Chronicles.\\"<br />Finding the Faith by Mary Kirchoff ***** - This author has also been quite deservedly prolific in the DragonLance world and it's easy to see why with this extraordinarily well written tale.  Although this tale should've been part of \\"Chronicles,\\" I'd imagine Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman didn't include it to save time.  \\"Finding the Faith\\" is the story of Laurana's quest to find the fabled Dragon Orb in Icewall, told from the viewpoint of Raggart Knug, High Cleric of the Ice People.<br />Legacy by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman ***** - What can one expect when these exceptional authors team up for a DragonLance story; nothing less than perfection, which is what is delivered in \\"Legacy.\\"  It is now twenty five years since the events of \\"Legends\\" and Caramon is summoned to the Tower of High Sorcery in Wayreth along with his three sons Tanin, Sturm and Palin.  The leaders of the three different mage orders believe that Raistlin is still alive in the Abyss and planning on using Caramon's youngest son Palin to make a comeback from the Abyss...  {ssintrepid}	2003-08-14

I found the premise and the setting of this novel to be in good keeping with A. C. Crispin's style of writing and well on par with a Star Trek The Next Generation novel of this timeframe.  It's unfortunate that this novel was A. C. Crispin's first and last adventure in the STNG arena.  Given this and her past Star Trek novels, it would be nice to see her make a return to Star Trek, in any of its variants, in the full novel format.<br />The premise:  <br />The Enterprise is called into a recently opened trade route to investigate the disappearance of several Federation and Klingon vessels.  Once there, they uncover a graveyard full of ships.  They find an extremely large and powerful artifact constructed by an ancient species.  Upon studying this ancient artifact, they trigger it and they then find themselves in the positions of having to disable or destroy it before it destroys them.<br />I would definitely recommend this early STNG novel to any and all fans of Star Trek The Next Generation, casual or die hard alike.  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-28
US	52712162	R1QSJGXJ2H6RE3	0671035797	648645185	Enterprise Logs: Star Trek	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Enterprise Logs - Fascinating and well told stories!	From the colonial shores of America during the revolutionary war to the southern Pacific ocean in the embroiled second world war to the farthest reaches of the galaxy the proud name Enterprise has born the banner of honor, freedom and justice, conveying humanities best to friend and foe alike.  In these pages you will find ten exceptional, intriguing and truly inspirational short stories written by several of Star Trek's finest authors.  Along with the exceptional stories contained within the pages of this exceptional anthology there is a brief bio of the author telling each story.<br />Captain Israel Daniel Dickenson commanding the Sloop-of-War Enterprise<BR> The Veil at Valcour by Diane Carey - Given her extensive experience with sailing ships of this time period, very few authors could've taken on the task of telling this wonderful story about the Sloop-of-War Enterprise, a ship seized by colonial sailors from the British during the American Revolutionary war.  Although I have little clue of the majority of the terminology used in this story, I found the story itself to be truly inspirational.<br />Captain Osborne B. Hardison commanding the U.S.S. Enterprise<BR> World of Strangers by Diane Carey - Here, Diane Carey takes on the task of telling a brief story of the USS Enterprise during WWII in the Pacific.  She takes and accomplishes that task quite well as she turns not so much to telling the tale of the combat itself but to the human side of the equation and the terrible sacrifices and loss this war brought on.  Only one minor point of contention on my part, military time doesn't work as it is portrayed in this great story.<br />Captain Robert April commanding the USS Enterprise NCC-1701<BR> Though Hell Should Bar the Way by Greg Cox - Having read every Trek novel written by this author up to the date of this publication, I believe I can say unequivocally that Greg Cox's stories in the Star Trek universe are absolutely exceptional and a complete joy to read!  In this short story we meet Captain Robert April as he's leading his ship and crew at breakneck speed to get to Tarsus IV in time before a famine starts taking lives.  Along the way though, they encounter Klingon commander Kor and his orders to stop any and all Federation vessels from approaching Tarsus IV.<br />Captain Christopher Pike commanding the USS Enterprise NCC-1701<BR> Conflicting Natures by Jerry Oltion - I've only had the please so far of reading one of Jerry Oltion's previous stories, but I can definitely say now that he has an excellent writing style that I enjoy.  Here he tells the hilarious story of Captain Pike, after engaging Klingons having to pick up an Eremoid that wishes to \\"observe\\" the crew in their day to day routine.  The camaraderie of the crew really sticks out in this one.<br />Captain James T. Kirk commanding the USS Enterprise NCC-1701 &amp; NCC-1701-A<BR> The Avenger by Michael Jan Friedman - Star Trek's most prolific author proffers up this tale of Captain Kirk on a mission to see that peace talks between the Draqqi and the Iach'tu end successfully.  Early in his career, Kirk had been briefly stationed on Draqqana and of course, there is a woman involved.  There is a murder of a high profile Draqqi in the midst of the peace talks and Kirk pairs up with that woman who is now the chief Draqqi investigator.  This story is in quite good keeping with Michael Jan Friedman's excellent style of writing.<br />Captain Will Decker commanding the USS Enterprise NCC-1701<BR> Night Whispers by Diane Duane - Although it had been quite some time since Diane Duane had visited Gene Roddenberry's universe, with this story she makes an excellent return.  We visit Captain Will Decker as he is in the process of overseeing the refit of the USS Enterprise right before the events depicted in Star Trek The Motion Picture.  Here, Captain Decker must solve the puzzle of some strange script written into the LCARS computer system recently installed on the Enterprise.<br />Captain Spock commanding the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-A<BR> Just Another Little Training Cruise by A. C. Crispin - This fine author had also taken a lengthy respite from Gene Roddenberry's universe and makes a triumphant return with this outstanding story.  Here she tells the tale of Spock, the Captain of the Enterprise as she is being used as an Academy training vessel and the beginnings of his \\"feelings\\" toward Saavik.  We learn when and where they met and this tale beautifully sets up the events in the exceptional novel, \\"Vulcan's Heart\\" by Josepha Sherman and Susan Shwartz.<br />Captain John Harriman commanding the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-B<BR> Shakedown by Peter David - As one of Star Trek's premier authors, Peter David's stories are well told, thought provoking, captivating, humorous and oft times, quite compelling as is the case with this outstanding story of Captain Harriman.  \\"Somehow\\" he's been captured by the Romulans and is being interrogated by Rokan, the Tal Shiar's top interrogator.  As is with the majority of Peter David's work, this story was a true pleasure to read.<br />Captain Rachel Garret commanding the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-C<BR> Hour of Fire by Robert Greenberger - In this exciting and invigorating tale, Robert Greenberger takes us to a point early in Captain Rachel Garret's command of the Enterprise.  She and the Enterprise are on a mission to find an M Class planet for a race known as the Warin.  What is especially poignant about this story is her interaction with the crew and then how that crew deals with the emergency that arises.  This story was extremely enjoyable.<br />Captain Jean Luc Picard commanding the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D &amp; NCC-1701-E<BR> The Captain and the King by John Vornholt - One of the best series of books to have come out to date was the Captain's Table series and this story is a real treat as John Vornholt revisits this mythical place.  This is an interesting tale of how Picard helped a \\"would be\\" Kingof Andoria make the ultimate sacrifice.  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-21

Sadly enough, this was author, Jean Lorrah's fourth and final venture into Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek universe.  Conversely, this was the first Star Trek The Next Generation non numbered novel that set the path for many more to come, both in paperback and hardback.  As many good authors do, she drew characters from her earlier novel, STNG #4 \\"Survivors\\" and pulled them into this new adventure.  In this first grand novel adventure, Jean Lorrah presents to the reader what the episodes never did, Data actually becoming human and the consequences of that.<br />The premise:<br />The Enterprise is called to the planet Elysia when it starts to experience unexplained gravitational disturbances.  Captain Picard quite fatefully assigns primary control of the mission to Lieutenant Commander Data who sets out to accomplish the mission.  While on the mission he meets an Elysian named Thelia who believes that Data has been sent by the Gods to help her on her quest and in helping her do so, he meets these \\"Gods\\" who grant him the one thing he's not capable of doing himself; they make him human.<br />What follows from there is an intriguing and compelling story that at times doesn't quite live up to what the reader might expect but still carries the story along rather well.  Overall, this was a good first \\"novel\\" for the Star Trek The Next Generation series and sadly, the last visit into this \\"universe\\" by its author.  Hopefully in the future, she will come back as some of the authors who disappeared from the rolls have.<br />I would definitely recommend this early STNG novel to any and all fans, casual or die hard alike.  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-20

As good as his first Star Trek novel, Star Trek The Next Generation #5 - \\"Strike Zone\\" is, \\"A Rock and a Hard Place\\" is that much better.  If you were to read through the entirety of the early STNG novels, you will quickly gather that there are a couple authors' novels that are to be looked forward to, Peter David's and Michael Jan Friedman's.  With this particular installment, Peter David firmly reaffirmed and set himself in place as the one Star Trek author that can deliver a solid plot with thought provoking twists and an excellent sense of humor.  His novels are the ones that will make you laugh as you read along.<br />The premise:<br />The planet Paradise is being terraformed but the terraformers in charge have fallen behind schedule and they've requested assistance.  Commander William T. Riker of the USS Enterprise is given that task and sets off for Paradise.  This is where we see Riker on his own, dealing with nature and its quirks.<br />Meanwhile, aboard the Enterprise, Riker's temporary replacement is a brazen individual by the name of Commander Quinton Stone and let's just says that he and the Captain and crew of the Enterprise aren't getting along chummily!<br />What follows is but a mere inkling as to some of the outstanding adventures that author Peter David will take Star Trek fans on in the future.  I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of the genre!  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-20

What do you get when you have a Star Trek The Next Generation novel written by the likes of Carmen Carter, Peter David, Michael Jan Friedman and Robert Greenberger?  What I and everybody else who reads Star Trek novels were expecting was an outstanding novel that is exciting, enlightening, highly thought provoking and just plain fun to read.  Unfortunately, while this novel is well worth reading, it doesn't quite live up to the expectations one might place on it given the caliber of the authors involved.  After years of reading Star Trek novels, I believe I can definitely discern who wrote at least a couple of the parts.  In \\"Doomsday World\\" we as Star Trek readers have the precursor to many of the outstanding duology's, trilogies and mini series that have been written since.<br />The premise:<br />A long dead race known as the Ariantu built an artificial world named Kirlos.  That planet is now home to many different Federation and K'vin Hegemony races that have lived together peacefully for many years.  Kirlos is also home to many different archaeological treasures and Captain Picard and the Enterprise have been sent to help uncover them.  Once there, Captain Picard assigns Data, Worf and Geordi to the away team but upon arrival they soon find themselves cut off from the Enterprise and they're now the prime suspects in several terrorists' attacks.  What follows from there is an interesting and intriguing plot that if it were written by any one of these fine authors independently, would've been an exceptional story, however, with the many \\"hands in the cooking pot,\\" it comes off as somewhat disjointed.<br />Despite some of the problems with this particular novel, I would still definitely recommend it as good Star Trek reading for the casual or die hard fan alike.  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-20

Given the complexity and thought provoking nature of this particular novel it is hard to believe that this is not only the only Star Trek novel written by this author is it the only novel one can find written by Keith Sharee.  I found this novel to be in very good keeping with Gene Roddenberry's principals and ethos of Star Trek as it tells a well told tale that is capable of the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" within the Star Trek universe as it is a real future possibility and reminds one of Hitler's attempts to do the same.<br />The premise:<br />The Enterprise finds itself on the mission to find the USS Huxley, a starship that has been missing for over ten years, what they did not expect to find is a forgotten human colony named Rampart.  Here is where the story takes an unexpected twist as this colony of humans has sought fit to ban fiction of any sort and it is considered to be the ultimate crime.  As history proves proper, whenever there is a government that bans something harmless, or proves itself a dictatorship in any way, there is an underground movement and ultimately a civil war.  It is that civil war in which Captain Picard and the crew of the USS Enterprise suddenly find themselves inextricably in the middle of and must find an acceptable way of extricating themselves and solving this planet's problems...<br />What follows is certainly one of the better early Star Trek The Next Generation numbered novels that is well worth the time to locate and read for you will certainly not be disappointed.

In concept, the premise to this story is an ideal concept, in practice though; it's not carried forward very well.  Given the conclusion of that TOS episode, one would find it difficult to believe that the culture of that planet would've advanced enough that in the twenty fourth century they'd be given a starship to command and crew for even in Science Fiction and especially in Gene Roddenberry's universe, the suspension of disbelief must be plausible, but that is hardly accomplished in this early Star Trek The Next Generation novel.  That is not to say that this novel is not worth reading because I believe all of the Star Trek novels are worth reading, this one just doesn't stack up too well with the rest.<br />The premise:<br />The planet Tenara is being has been attacked several times by M'Dok Empire causing Starfleet to call in the Enterprise and another Federation starship, the Centurion.  As a point of conflict, Captain Picard feels that negotiation must be the first strategy they use but Captain Sejanus of the Centurion feels that they must take a harder stance against the M'Dok.  All the while, the people of Tenara who are suffering these attacks must choose the path that must be taken to attempt to end these attacks...<br />While not too heavy on the action, this novel does present a thought provoking, if not plausible, set of circumstances within the Federation and should be taken for what it is, an early STNG novel that was written when the show was very young and the overall feel of the characters and the series hadn't quite gelled yet.  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-19

This was the first of his novels that I'd read and from this very beginning I found his writing to be quite compelling and a true joy to read.  If you've read any of his later novels and not read this one yet, I suggest that you go back and check this one out for you will not be disappointed in the least.<br />The premise:<br />Captain Picard and the Enterprise discover a lifeless Federation research vessel in orbit of a planet that his hidden behind a mysterious energy shield.  Despite the strong and ever present objections of his first officer, Commander Riker, Captain Picard leads an away team to the abandoned vessel to search for the crew; then they disappear.  Commander Riker now finds himself in the position of having to find his missing Captain and crew and at the same time a mysterious disease strikes the crew of the starship...<br />Of the many early Star Trek The Next Generation novels, this one stands a cut above the rest due to Michael Jan Friedman's captivating and intriguing writing style.  I would definitely recommend this early STNG novel to any and all fans.  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-19

Of the few Howard Weinstein Star Trek novels I've read so far, I've found them to be intriguing and well told stories, as is the case with this novel, Star Trek The Next Generation #6, Power Hungry.  His writing style is fairly fluid and he sets the plot up fairly well.  As other reviewers have noted, he wrote in an environmentalist point of view which is in good keeping with the overall \\"ethos\\" of Star Trek and, in my opinion, serves to help the plot along as opposed to detracting from it.<br />The premise:<br />Captain Picard and the Enterprise are sent to the planet Thiopa to deliver and provide emergency relief in the face of a planetary famine.  Once there, they discover that there is more than meets the eye as the planetary government, thought to be a Federation ally, is a brutal dictatorship.  Captain Picard finds that he's in the midst of a major dilemma, whether or not to deliver the famine relief which would only serve to help the dictatorship, knowing full well that they would not reach the people or attempting to change the attitude of the government, which would obviously be an uphill battle all the way.<br />What follows is an interesting and somewhat intriguing early Star Trek The Next Generation story that is well worth the time to read, giving the reader insight into the authors perceptions of the crew during this early period of STNG's run on television.  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-19

Keeping in mind that this was Peter David's first venture into the Star Trek universe, I thought this was a very good beginning for him.  This is of course when one considers the prolific nature of how many Star Trek books this outstanding author has written.  Peter David's style of writing, from this very first STNG novel of his to his latest, has always been quite fluid with superb plot detail and as always, a healthy amount of humor which other Star Trek novels sometimes lack.  While I agree with other reviewers in that the conclusion to this novel is a bit off when compared to the rest of it, overall, this novel gave Star Trek readers but the first taste of many extraordinary adventures in Gene Roddenberry's universe by this author!<br />The premise:<br />This is also where Peter David first introduces the Kreel, a warlike race that he has briefly visited many times since.  Here, the Kreel have happened upon powerful alien weapons and they decide to use these weapons on their blood enemies, everybody's favorite enemy, the Klingons.<br />Captain Picard and the Enterprise are called in to hopefully mediate a truce between these two bitter enemies and hopefully discover the nature of the powerful weapons discovered by the Kreel.  What follows, is as I said above, an excellent first adventure in the twenty fourth century by one of Star Trek's premier authors, Peter David.<br />I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek and the Star Trek novels for you will certainly not be disappointed by this fine trek offering.  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-16

Of all of the early Star Trek The Next Generation novels, this one definitely stands out among the rest as being one of the better ones.  Granted, there are a few back story or canon errors within this one but that is to be expected as this one was written very early in the series run on television and the author had no idea where the series was going to go with respect to certain aspects.  The sad thing is that this fine author has only published four novels in the Star Trek arena, two Original Series novels and two STNG novels.  Considering how well she wrote these novels, it would be very nice to see her make a foray back into Gene Roddenberry's universe.  For fans of Lieutenant Tasha Yar, this quick but excellent novel is a real treat.<br />The premise:<br />As this was written very early in the television series, the author picked up well on the dynamic interpersonal relationship between Commander Data and Lieutenant Tasha Yar.  In doing so, she put these two characters in the midst of away mission on their own, dropping them off on a human colony known as Treva.  They quickly become embroiled in the situation to include running into a Starfleet fugitive that just so happens to have been Tasha's former fiancé.  While this human colony \\"was\\" intent on becoming a Federation member (which is a bit of an irony considering that it is a \\"human\\" colony), they find themselves having to deal with a violent revolution.  Now Data and Yar find themselves in the middle of a bloody revolution and having to find a way to end the bloodshed and stay alive at the same time.  <br />What follows is as I stated above, an excellent early STNG novel that captures the dynamic of the relationship between Data and Yar extremely well.  The last chapter of this outstanding novel is also quite intriguing as well.<br />I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans; die hard or casual, of the Star Trek genre as it well exceeds the Star Trek novels of its time.  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-14

As we learned in Peter David's first Q novel, STNG #18, \\"Q-In-Law\\" and his later and even more brilliant hardback, \\"Q-Squared,\\" he knows Q and he writes Q with nothing but perfection.  With I, Q, Peter David raises that level of perfection to a new height as this narrative story, written almost entirely from Q's perspective is nothing short of brilliant, witty and extraordinarily intriguing.  Of course, this novel is made even better by the fact that Q himself, John De Lancie co-wrote this masterpiece.  While some may have found the style in which this novel was written somewhat distracting, I found it to be \\"dead on\\" with the character of Q and his personality.<br />The premise:<br />We begin this story with a character that by all appearances seems to be superior to Q and the Q-Continuum.  In this beautifully well written beginning, we learn that this \\"supreme\\" being has decided that the multiverse is no longer of any value and that it should literally be run down the drain.  Just as this process begins, this \\"supreme\\" being discovers a bottle with a narrative in it, written by you know who.<br />This is where the story gets extremely interesting as Q takes us through his narrative as he takes Captain Picard, Data and us, the readers, through multiple planes of existence, on a search to find his wife and son.  While the story advances along, he also regales us with tales from his past that at times are utterly intriguing, humorous and a bit telling of his character.<br />In no uncertain terms, I, Q is a purely brilliant story as Peter David takes us through Q's trials and tribulations along the way to finding his wife and son while the multiverse is crumbling around him.<br />While there are many absolutely great Star Trek authors, Peter David work stands above the rest, as does I, Q.  I highly recommend this Star Trek novel to any all fans of Star Trek, whether you're a die hard fan or a casual fan that has only seen one or two episodes with Q, you will thoroughly enjoy this outstanding Q novel.<br />I would also recommend the audio book or CD, as it makes for a wonderful way to pass three hours on the highway, made even better by the fact that this story is read by Q himself, John De Lancie.  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-14

Of the many great Star Trek authors that have been published, one of them consistently rises above them all with thought provoking, humorous and intriguing stories in this genre, that being Peter David.  With Q-Squared being Peter David's second Q story, after STNG #18 - \\"Q-In-Law,\\" he again proved that he perfectly captured the character of Q and put to print a true masterpiece involving this extremely intriguing character.<br />The premise:<br />Q-Squared is nothing short of brilliant as Peter David deftly weaves this tale involving characters from both The Original Series and past characters from Star Trek The Next Generation.  Many a fan will remember Trelane from The Original Series episode \\"The Squire of Gothos.\\"  As Captain Kirk dealt with him, he was an extremely powerful but ultimately impetuous character that at the end of that wonderful episode he was proven to be a young character from an unknown race of beings.<br />As you will quickly learn, the powerful race of beings that Trelane comes from is the Q-Continuum and guess who has recently taken on the responsibility for his growth and development, you guessed it, Q.  As it happens, Q finds this responsibility to be somewhat taxing so he seeks out his good old \\"pal\\" Captain Jean Luc Picard, more affectionately known by Q as \\"Mon Capitan,\\" to aid in this great burden.<br />Here is where Peter David also firsts introduces the notion of the multiverse as he tracks us along in three different \\"universes,\\" three different crews of the Enterprise and their dealings with Q and Trelane.  I believe this to be the most appealing plot device in the entire story.<br />What follows is as stated above, one of the best Star Trek novels to ever grace the printed page as we follow along on Trelane's bent to destroy the universe and Q's amazing trials and tribulations while he's attempting to stop him.<br />I highly recommend this superb Star Trek novel to any and all who enjoy a great Star Trek story and to those who arejust casual fans of the genre as this one does not disappoint in the least.<br />Additionally, I highly recommend the audio tape or CD if you can get your hands on it as it is a great way to spend three hours on the highway, especially with Q himself, John De Lancie reading it.  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-14

Given that this was the very first of the original Star Trek The Next Generation novels and that the author didn't even have the benefit of a full season of the show to work with, she did a worthwhile job in her characterizations based on her limited knowledge of them.  Despite the television episodes having later disproved her suppositions about the characters, except for the strong bond between Data and Geordi LaForge, the author came up with a fairly decent concept for the plot.  Given the outstanding newer Star Trek stories she has published since this one, I'm certain had she had more time to watch the episodes and learn these outstanding characters, her plot and the characterizations within the pages of this story would've been much better.<br />The premise:<br />Conceptually, the premise for this story is a sound one, well based in science fiction as we're introduced to a Russian aircraft carrier in the year 1995.  We soon learn that there is an entity that will destroy the crew of this ship.  We're then brought to the twenty fourth century and the Captain and crew of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D must deal with this same threat or be left a \\"Ghost Ship\\" as well.<br />Would I recommend this first STNG novel, yes!  Why you say, from a fans and a collector's point of view, it was the first TNG novel that will lead the reader along the line of all of the STNG novels published to date and it is quite interesting to read through them, seeing how they've improved, along with the series.  If you've never read a Star Trek novel written by this fine Star Trek author before, whatever you do, do not dismiss her as a bad Trek author, for this was but the first of her STNG efforts and she has so many others that are well worth the time to read them!  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-11

This review is for those who in particular may have read a few of the later Star Trek The Next Generation novels or novels from the other series and find yourself interested in reading the earlier STNG novels.  While in these early novels, you may find the author's characterizations to be somewhat off and their knowledge of the twenty fourth century techno-babble to be somewhat off as well.  What you will generally find though is that the majority of these early stories are well based in science fiction and some of the authors, such as the author of this novel, make up for that lack of back story knowledge by concentrating on what they did know.  Of the few Star Trek novels that Gene DeWeese wrote, I found them all to be quite intriguing and generally good reads.  I read this one quite some time ago myself, but the basics of the story still resonate, lending to how well the author wrote this one.<br />The premise:<br />While returning to the nearest Starbase from a mission dealing with the Ferengi, the Enterprise detects a derelict ship.  Being the explorers that they are, Captain Picard orders Data and LaForge to investigate the derelict.  While on board, they're transported light years away to a similar ship that is orbiting a planet that is in crisis.  While Captain Picard and crew frantically search for his lost crewman, Data and LaForge find themselves embroiled in the middle of a political crisis in which the inhabitants of the ship they were transported to have been and are continuing to use the alien technology of the ship to maintain the peace between all the factions on the Earth like planet below.<br />I definitely recommend this second novel in the Star Trek The Next Generation series as it is a well written story and it fits well within the STNG series.  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-11

While not being her best STNG novel, which in my opinion is \\"The Devil's Heart, it is a well written and thought provoking early Star Trek The Next Generation story.  What is amazing is that it took the author two years to write her previous Star Trek The Original Series novel, \\"Dreams of the Raven,\\" but after being given only three months for this novel, she wrote it so well!<br />The premise:<br />Everybody in Starfleet and the Federation knows the tale of the small Federation colony of Hamlin where aliens called the Choraii came and destroyed the colony, killed all of the adults and abducted the children and disappeared into the blackness of space.  It is now fifty years later and the Choraii have returned, but this time they will have to deal with the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D, her stalwart commanding officer, Captain Jean Luc Picard and her crew.<br />I would definitely recommend this early Star Trek The Next Generation novel for it's author is among one of the best of the early trek authors and it is a well written, thought provoking tale, raising the question of children who were kidnapped and later, as adults, are given the opportunity to return to their own kind but wish to stay where they are.  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-11

I have to admit that prior to reading the first Strange New Worlds novel I was a little reticent about fan fiction.  That being said, the Strange New Worlds I & II novels more than removed that reticence, they turned me into a huge fan of these fan fiction novels, leaving me very much looking forward to the third one.  Strange New Worlds III is an even more impressive collection than its predecessors.  I highly recommend this novel to any and all fans of Star Trek, for in each and every story lays the principles, ethics and overall atmosphere that Star Trek fans have come to love about Gene Roddenberry's universe. <br />Star Trek<br />If I Lose Thee (First Prize) by Sarah A. Hoyt & Rebecca Lickiss  - It is extremely easy to see why this particularly great story involving Uhura and the Guardian of Forever won first prize and these two fine authors are now professional writers!<br />The Aliens Are Coming! By Dayton Ward  - As with the two authors above, it is quite easy to see why Dayton Ward is now a professional author as well considering his fluid writing style and his talent for plot development.  This particular story draws from the events in DS9's \\"Little Green Men\\" and TOS's \\"Tomorrow is Yesterday,\\" weaving a wonderful tale as to what happened to Captain Christopher after the Enterprise left.<br />Family Matters by Susan Ross Moore  - Another well written and thoughtful story!  This extraordinarily interesting tale is about a younger Spock meeting his Aunt on Earth and helping with his cousin.<br />Star Trek The Next Generation<br />Whatever You Do, Don't Read This Story (Third Prize) by Robert T. Jeschonek  - I must admit that at first, I was wondering why this story made third prize, needless to say though, the story plays out extraordinarily well and this author deserves high praise for such an inventive and original story.<br />A Private Victory by Tonya D. Price  - This is a very well done story about Lieutenant Hawk during the events depicted in Star TrekFirst Contact.  I look forward to this author's future endeavors.<br />The Fourth Toast by Kelly Cairo  - Nods to this author for bringing this exceptional story to print that is one of those follow up stories that \\"needed\\" to be told.  Following the events of STNG's \\"Yesterday's Enterprise,\\" we're taken into Richard Castillo's world after the loss of the Enterprise NCC-1701-C.  Great story!  <br />One of Forty-seven by E. Catherine Tobler  - This story is an exceptionally well done and quite poignant short story!<br />A Q to Swear By by Shane Zeranski  - I look very much forward to any future stories written by this author as he has with this story written some exceptional Star Trek, tying in events from TNG and a certain, troubled character we saw in Star Trek Voyager.<br />The Change of Seasons by Logan Page  - This is another fine short story that quite poignantly tells one of the small, between the scenes, tales within the frame of Star Trek Generations.  Quite touching!<br />Out of the Box, Thinking by Jerry M. Wolfe  - Nods to this author as well as he has written an intriguing and quite humorous story bringing back one of STNG's most interesting and endearing characters, Professor Moriarty.<br />Star Trek Deep Space Nine<br />Ninety-three Hours (Second Prize) by Kim Sheard  - I'm not sure I can properly express how truly well written this story is and how much praise the author deserves for having written it.  Had this author been published previously, this superb story about Ezri Tigan (Dax) would've surely made it between the covers of \\"The Lives of Dax\\" anthology!<br />Dorian's Diary by G. Wood - This is another well written DS9 tale detailing what Ensign Dorian Collins went through after the DS9 episode centered around the USS Valiant and the cadets who were forced to captain her.  The author deftly weaves into the tale a couple of the better guest characters from TOS and TNG.<br />The Bottom Line by Andrew (Drew) Morby - This is another strong DS9 talethat is both highly entertaining and enlightening especially for those who might've been wondering how Cadet Nog was getting along at Starfleet Academy!<br />The Best Defense... by John Takis  - This exceptional tale brings into light what Bashir and O'Brien were doing in the holodeck that the series didn't often have time to elaborate upon.

From his first appearance on Star Trek Deep Space Nine in the third episode of the first season, \\"Past Prologue,\\" the character of Garak, played so admirably by Andrew Robinson, has been one of the most enigmatic yet intriguing and compelling characters to have been introduced into the tapestry that is Star Trek.  After bringing such a richness and depth to this character for seven years of television, Andrew Robinson sought after and was given the opportunity to bring Garak into the world of Star Trek novels and the result is a resounding success.  From the very first page to the last, \\"A Stitch in Time\\" is just as the character Garak is, intriguing and quite compelling.  If there ever was a Star Trek Deep Space novel that deserved a hardback release, this was it!<br />Oft times, actors who take up pen and paper to write a story about their character seemingly fall flat.  That is not the case with \\"A Stitch in Time!\\"  Andrew Robinson is a superb author that writes as he speaks, with fluidity and purpose.<br />The premise:<br />This wonderful \\"memoir\\" is told entirely from Garak's point of view in the form of entries in his personal journal and letters to Doctor Bashir, his one true friend on Deep Space Nine.  It covers the better part of his life, from the days of his youth where he grew up with his mother and \\"father\\", Mila and Tolan, living in his childhood home, with his \\"Uncle\\" Enabran Tain living upstairs.<br />As this wonderful story moves along, Garak takes us to the Bamarren Institute where he learns some of life's harder lessons along with meeting the one woman he truly loves but cannot have, to his initiation into the Obsidian Order by the leader of that secret organization, his Uncle, Enabran Tain.  While exploring his youth and the decisions that brought him to the present, Garak is also telling Doctor Bashir of his days on Cardassia after the events depicted in the last few episodes of Deep Space Nine where the Cardassians turned on their Dominion \\"friends\\" and the planet was subjected to orbital bombardment by the Dominion warships.<br />Most important of what you'll find in this outstanding novel is the events that lead to Garak's being exiled to Deep Space Nine and of interest, though not canon, is we learn what Dukat's first name is as well.<br />I highly recommend this book to any and all fans of Star Trek and Deep Space Nine, for it is well worth the time spent reading it even if you're merely a casual fan of the series or the books.  The author weaves a beautiful tapestry of Garak's life.  {ssintrepid}	2003-07-03

If a Star Trek novel reader has ever picked up and read a Star Trek novel written by Michael Jan Friedman before and are about to pick up another, they're usually guaranteed one of the better Star Trek novels and STNG The Valiant is no exception to that rule.  Given that he is the most prolific of the many Star Trek writers and has written within the many different series, he has a fair amount of knowledge and experience he brings to the page and it clearly shows throughout his stories.  Of interest is that when this story was published, it was published under the series name of Star Trek The Next Generation, but since the release of the Stargazer novels, it is now listed as the second in the Stargazer series, right behind \\"Reunion.\\"<br />In \\"The Valiant,\\" MJ Friedman draws from several on screen plots and his past novels to create an exceptional USS Stargazer story, depicting events aboard that small vessel in a timeframe when Captain Picard was Commander Picard and he was the second officer.  Combining the crew he created in his previous Stargazer novel \\"Reunion\\" and a small amount of the plot line he used in the \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" trilogy, he deftly crafts an excellent tale surrounding the events that lead to Jean Luc Picard becoming one of the youngest to ever make Captain in Starfleet.  Of note is the great crew he's created to surround Picard on board the Stargazer.  Each and every character is well thought out and gets appropriate time within the story without detracting from the main plot events.<br />The premise:<br />The Valiant<br />In the beginning of this exceptional story, we're taken some three hundred years in Starfleet history to when the SS Valiant is thrown beyond the galactic barrier and is trying to make her way back home through the galactic barrier.  The SS Valiant is first mentioned in The Original Series episode \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before.\\"  Unfortunately for Captain Tarasco, who captain's the SS Valiant; their failed attempt to crossthe barrier results in several casualties and in particular one crewman begins to exhibit \\"godlike\\" powers and loses all compassion for human life, thinking of his fellow humans more as bugs than his equals.  This leaves Captain Tarasco with few options.<br />USS Stargazer<br />The Stargazer, captained by Captain Ruhalter with Commander Jean Luc Picard as second officer is summoned to Starbase 209.  Upon arrival, they receive their mission briefing which encompasses two \\"descendants\\" of the SS Valiant who claim that they're ancestors, some three hundred years ago, were the crew of the Valiant and they \\"did\\" survive to form a colony on the other side of the barrier.  These two descendants bring with them warnings of an invasion into Federation territory by a species that lives on the other side of the galactic barrier known and the Nuyyad.<br />With plenty of skepticism to spare, the Captain and crew of the USS Stargazer head out for the galactic barrier with one of the descendants on board and a Kelvan advisor aboard to determine the truth in this warning and hopefully deal with it accordingly.<br />What follows is an exceptional story detailing the events surrounding how Commander Jean Luc Picard became Captain Picard, in command of the USS Stargazer.  Along with this, one of the better aspects of the novel is the authors setting up the events in \\"Reunion\\" with reference to his Chief Medical Officer Carter Greyhorse.<br />The Audio Tape:<br />Read by Anthony Stewart Head - While this is no replacement for reading the actual and full story it makes for a good three hour distraction when cruising down the highway. <br />I highly recommend this Star Trek novel to any and all fans of the series for it is definitely one of the better Trek stories in print.  {ssintrepid}	2003-06-19

Along with these characters, the author also brings Captain Kirk and Spock into the mix as well.<br />Several Star Trek readers I've talked to in the past have complained of Diane Carey's injecting so much \\"naval\\" speak into her Star Trek novels, this is an opinion I do not share as I believe it gives her novels a distinctiveness all her own. I always have and continue to look forward to reading her novels as she is one of the top Star Trek authors.<br />The premise:<br />This outstanding STNG novel begins with the crew of the USS Bozeman in the year 2278 telling the events where Captain Morgan Bateson and his ship were engaged against a Klingon ship just prior to and leading up to the events in the STNG episode \\"Cause and Effect,\\" where the USS Bozeman came through a temporal anomaly coming forward ninety years and \\"nearly\\" colliding with the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D. <br />The novel is now set in the timeframe of approximately five months after the events depicted in \\"Star Trek Generations,\\" where the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D is lost. Captain Picard and the majority of his senior staff are at Starbase 12 awaiting their next assignment which is hopefully the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-E, the beautiful Sovereign Class starship first seen in \\"Star Trek First Contact.\\" Of course Worf at this time is on Deep Space Nine.<br />From this point the author takes the reader through a superb story where on one end,Captain Morgan Bateson is in charge of the shakedown cruise of the Enterprise-E and dealing with the same Klingon that forced him into the temporal anomaly and on the other end, Captain Picard is headed into Cardassian territory to deal with Gul Madred, his tormentor from \\"Chain of Command.\\"<br />I highly recommend this Star Trek The Next Generation novel; it certainly deserved the hardback that it came in as it outclasses many of the Star Trek stories in print. {ssintrepid}	2003-06-15

This is the extremely poignant story of a young Russian from Leningrad by the name of Vladislav Tamarov who at the age of nineteen was conscripted into the Soviet Army knowing full well his destination upon completing his basic and airborne training, Afghanistan.  Rarely if ever have I read a story such as this, told with the full depth of emotions over what someone has seen and been forced to participate in.<br />After his conscription, Vladislav went to basic and airborne training, where by his description the training was wholeheartedly inadequate to the task at hand.  But then, armies can train basic trainees in the very basics of soldiering but they can never fully prepare them for the realities that lay ahead when facing actual combat.  Of note is the fact that he and his fellow trainees spent a lot of time on the airborne training only to never use it in Afghanistan.<br />Armed with this most minimal of training, Vladislav and his fellow basic training graduates headed off for Afghanistan.  Landing in Kabul he saw the first of many dichotomies where the people of Afghanistan attempted to continue to live their lives the best they could despite rocket attacks and a constant shifting between the Afghanistan government's forces and the Mujahadeen.  To add to his already cumbersome load of trying to learn how to survive in combat, he was also immediately picked out to be a minesweeper, the job that few soldiers of any army wants to have.  <br />Vladislav goes on to tell us of the many strife's and hardships that both he and his fellow soldiers endured and some which who did not survive.  I found the style in which he told his story to be quite compelling as he tells it with a great depth of emotion to include areas where he seems to almost be in a dream/nightmare state where in one paragraph he's home, he's made it and in the next paragraph he's still in Afghanistan running for his life or attempting to save a friends life.<br />Of interest is how for quite sometime at the beginning of this war the Soviet people were not told what was happening and why young soldiers were coming home in zinc coffins.  To us, as Americans, it would seem unthinkable for our government to commit so many assets to a combat action without telling the general populace.  To think that the USSR attempted to do is almost inconceivable.<br />Overall this is a story in pictures and words that is very telling of the experiences young men go through in war and the author deserves high praise for bringing it to print and those of us fortunate to have read it!  I myself am in the Army and I found that I learned a great deal from this person that today I call a friend but back in my early days in the Army I was told he and his fellow soldiers were my enemy, thank God that's a war that never happened.  I hope for him today that the demons of this war do not still haunt him for he and his fellow Afghansti have seen enough demons!<br />I highly recommend this book to any and all for it will certainly enrich your knowledge of the Soviet Afghan war and bring you in touch with the author who a truly honorable man who when he was but a mere teenager was forced to grow old before his time.  {ssintrepid}	2003-06-09

Given that I continue to read all of the Star Trek series in order of their particular chronological release dates, I've looked at this particular trilogy for quite some time with no small measure of anxiousness to get to them.  Now that I've made it to them, they were quite well worth the wait and shall be savored for quite some time.  In this great Omnibus this writing team writes with a great sense of fluidity and an overall well balanced style.  Unlike some previous Deep Space Nine authors, they show a great sense of knowledge of the series and Star Trek as a whole.  They captured each characters personality and style flawlessly!  Had this particular trilogy been set in either Star Trek The Next Generation or Star Trek Voyager series it most certainly would've garnered three hardbacks, but fortunately for us, Pocket Books up to this point still wasn't willing to foot the bill for a Deep Space Nine hardback even for this trilogy which so richly deserved it!  Fortunately this outstanding Omnibus is now available and quite well worth it!<br />Set somewhere in the frenetic sixth season of Deep Space Nine, Millennium is a project of epic proportions for Star Trek fiction that simply leaves one breathless as they're completely enthralled in this page turner that compels the reader at a blistering pace from chapter to chapter leading you into a highly climatic ending.<br />Star Trek Deep Space Nine Millennium Book I of III - The Fall of Terok Nor<br />The premise:<br />This story spans the history of Bajor and the short six years that Starfleet and Captain Sisko has been in command of Deep Space Nine.  Going back to the Day of Withdrawal, the day the Cardassians withdrew from Bajor after sixty years of brutal oppression and slavery, this novel begins with Quark, Odo and Garak witnessing an event they will not remember for sometime...<br />Captain Sisko finds himself and his crew in the precarious position of trying to solve the murder of an Andorian smuggler whose bodyguards wish to seek revenge upon Quark who they believe murdered the Andorian.  At the same time, Vash appears on the station bringing her usual trouble with her and three Cardassians show up as well, despite being in the middle of the Dominion War in which they're clearly an enemy species.  Add all of these events up and throw in some extremely interesting Bajoran artifacts that may spell doom for the station and what you have here is one of the most intriguing and compelling Star Trek  Deep Space Nine stories ever put to print!<br />Star Trek Deep Space Nine Millennium Book II of III The War of the Prophets<br />The premise:<br />At the conclusion of Book I, The Fall of Terok Nor, Captain Sisko and crew inadvertently brought together the three Red Orbs of Jalbador causing the destruction of Deep Space Nine and the creation of a second, red wormhole or temple to open up in Bajoran space.  In a desperate attempt to save as many lives as possible during the destruction of the station, Sisko orders Deep Space Nine abandoned.  He finds himself; his senior staff, his son, Garak, Vash, Quark and Rom are all aboard the Defiant.  While desperately trying to save as many lives as possible and get the Defiant away from the newly forming wormhole, his ship is fired upon by Leej Terrell, one of the few remaining Cardassians from the Obsidian Order who has been searching for the Red Orbs for years only to be foiled by Captain Sisko.  The Defiant is forced into the event horizon of the newly formed wormhole and slung into the future.  Captain Sisko and crew find themselves being fired upon by Starfleet vessels seemingly opposed to one another, both looking for his allegiance.<br />Captain Sisko now finds himself in the year 2400, right in the middle of the War of the Prophets where Weyoun is now Kai Weyoun and he's leading the way towards bringing the two Celestial Temples together, forcing the destruction of the universe.<br />Star Trek Deep Space Nine Millennium Book III of III Inferno<br />The premise:<br />At the conclusion of Book II The War of the Prophets, Kai Weyoun has ensured that the two wormholes are in close proximity, causing the destruction of the universe.  Fortunately for our heroes, they all find a way to be there when the wormholes are opened and are consequently pulled into them just before the rest of the universe is snuffed out!  Here is where the trilogy gets extremely intriguing as the authors take us through the majority of the characters experiences as they're each thrust into their own personal Pah-wraith hell and are consequently saved from this by somebody that would be the least expected to do so.  <br />Captain Sisko now finds himself in the situation of having to come up with a way to get everybody home to their own time frame while saving the universe at the same time.  To hamper him and his crew in their collective efforts to get home, their stuck in the red wormhole and are constantly being shifted around in time.<br />The authors do an exceptional job of setting up a situation where our heroes have many problems to solve while at the same time, they're all shifting around in different time frames spanning six years on the station!  You add all this up and it all comes out as one of the best Star Trek trilogies in print!  I highly recommend this Star Trek Deep Space Nine trilogy as it is truly one of the best Star Trek stories in print!<br />Also included in this Omnibus:<br />DS9 Millennium Timeline by Allyn Gibson.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this outstanding Omnibus as this trilogy contains one of the best Star Trek stories in print and not to mention that the three paperbacks are no longer available.  {ssintrepid}	2003-06-08

Star Trek Deep Space Nine Millennium Book II of III The War of the Prophets<br />Simply put, Judith &amp; Garfield Reeves-Stevens have with this trilogy written one of the best Star Trek Deep Space Nine stories in print up to the point of Millennium's release date(s).  This is truly a story that will stand the test of time.  In Book I, The Fall of Terok Nor, the authors set up a very well written and fluid premise that they've continued to expound upon here in The War of the Prophets.  The concepts and ideas that the authors infused into this exceptional Star Trek Deep Space Nine story are nothing short of spectacular.  It is quite refreshing to read a story written by authors who are also fans who watch the shows and keep up with the details, major or minor.<br />The premise:<br />At the conclusion of Book I, The Fall of Terok Nor, Captain Sisko and crew inadvertently brought together the three Red Orbs of Jalbador causing the destruction of Deep Space Nine and the creation of a second, red wormhole or temple to open up in Bajoran space.

The only hope for the universe is Admiral Jean Luc Picard who is unfortunately addled by Irumodic Syndrome leaving his trusted aide de camp, Captain Nog to do the majority of the work.  <br />What follows is truly another outstanding work of Star Trek fiction that continues the story of \\"Millennium\\" quite admirably!  I highly recommend this and of course the first and third books along with the Millennium omnibus!  {ssintrepid}	2003-06-06

To say that at the very least Pocket Books should've produced this exceptional trilogy in hardback is a mere understatement!

As with the first book of this mini duology, John Vornholt continues to expound on the wonderful world he has created in Gemworld.  In the first book he described only a few of the quite interesting and different species of Gemworld.  In book two, he craftily brings the remaining species into the spotlight.  As with book one of the Gemworld mini duology and with all of his previous novels, John Vornholt again proves that he can create whole new microcosms within the Star Trek universe, capitalizing on the possibilities of the twenty fourth century and what the future of space travel can entail.  Of the entire myriad of outstanding Star Trek authors, John Vornholt stands out in the arena of bringing the oddest of creatures to sentience and cunningly scribing them into a well thought and compelling story or stories.<br />The premise:<br />Continuing where Star Trek # 58 Gemworld Book One left off, Captain Picard, Lieutenant Melora Pazlar and the most unlikely of heroes Lieutenant Reginald Barclay are deep in the quagmire of trying to save Melora's home world of Gemworld.  Facing a dimensional rift that is seemingly encompassing the entirety of the planet, deceit and deception of those they're trying to help and no apparent means of escape, Captain Picard and crew must find a way to gather the remaining crystals from all six of the sentient species inhabiting Gemworld in order to shut down the shell protecting Gemworld.  Combine all of these possibilities and it all adds up to another fairly compelling story by one of Star Trek's better authors.<br />I highly recommend this mini duology to those who read as many or all of the Star Trek novels and to those who are casual Trek readers.  {ssintrepid}	2003-05-23

One thing is for certain every time you pick up a Star Trek novel written by John Vornholt, he generally comes up with extremely well detailed descriptions for aliens and their worlds as he has done once again here with Gemworld.  Capitalizing on the Star Trek Deep Space Nine second season episode of \\"Melora,\\" John Vornholt has come up with a believable back story for her and her home world.  There are two theories about Gemworld, one is that it is artificial and the more believable of the two is that it is an ancient world that has gone through many phases and for a millennia its inhabitants have done everything they can to keep it intact.  Here is where John Vornholt's talents shine, besides the odd nature of the planet there are also six indigenous, sentient species on Gemworld, to include the Elaysians in which Melora is a member of.  What makes this one even more interesting and unusual is that Lieutenant Reginald Barclay is pretty much in the spotlight.  It is sometimes refreshing where the main characters aren't always the lead in a novel. <br />The premise:<br />Lieutenant Melora Pazlar is on board the Enterprise temporarily as a mission specialist and the Enterprise is on its way to Primus IV which is a low gravity planet.  As the Enterprise speeds its way towards Primus IV, Melora has a very real dream which she believes to have been induced by the Lipuls which are one of the six sentient species on her home world of Gemworld.  After a chance meeting between her and Lieutenant Reginald Barclay and a \\"Lipul\\" dream being forced on Counselor Troi, Captain Picard is forced to change course for Gemworld to determine what the crisis may be and hopefully help.  What follows is but the first of a two book series where this, the first one is another of John Vornholt's excellent Star Trek tales.<br />I highly recommend this and book two of this mini trek series as I'm greatly looking forward to reading the second one myself!  {ssintrepid}	2003-05-10

Taken as a whole this anthology; second in the Strange New Worlds series stands out miles ahead of its predecessor of a year earlier.  The majority of the stories by these non professional authors are extremely captivating and a few of them are quite compelling Star Trek short stories.  If you had misgivings or second thoughts about reading these particular anthologies, I recommend you rethink that as each and every story is worth your time.  The only downside to this and its predecessor in my opinion is that both contain only two Deep Space Nine stories.  This is an oversight as DS9 is a very rich environment that could be explored more thoroughly!<br />Star Trek<br />Triptych [Second Prize] by Melissa Dickinson**** - This is an interesting tale about the many outcomes from the TOS episode \\"The City on the Edge of Forever,\\" in which the question is asked, what if this happened or didn't happened.<br />The Quick and the Dead by Kathy Oltion ***** - This is a great tale about Kirk and crew taking a landing party down on a planet where everything on the planet is seemingly moving at light speed.<br />The First Law of Metaphysics by Michael S. Poteet **** - This is a surprisingly well written story about Spock and Saavik's first meeting several years after what happened on the Genesis planet.<br />The Hero of My Own Life by Peg Robinson ***** - This is an extremely well written tale about a meeting through scientific research of Gillian Taylor from Star Trek IV and Dr. Carol Marcus from Star Trek II.<br />Doctors Three by Charles Skaggs ***** - This is a beautiful and quite poignant story about Admiral Leonard McCoy circa the 24th century and his desire to meet with Dr. Zimmerman as he's in the process of creating and perfecting the Emergency Medical Hologram program of Star Trek Voyager fame.<br />Star Trek The Next Generation<br />I Am Klingon [Third Prize] by Ken Rand ***** - This particular fan fictionist knows his Klingons well and in this story he has written a very plausible explanation of the difference between Klingons of the TOS era and that of the TNG era.<br />Reciprocity by Brad Curry ***** - This by far is the best story of this particular anthology.  The author fluidly takes us to a time some four billion years in the past and tells a short story about the firstborn ones.<br />Calculated Risk by Christina F. York **** - This is a somewhat interesting tale about the rarely used character of Dr. Pulaski of STNG second season fame.<br />Gods, Fate, and Fractals by William Liesner ***** - This is another of the better stories of this anthology.  The author reintroduces us to agents Dulmer and Lucsley from Starfleet's Department of Temporal Investigations.  Presented here is an extremely interesting story about the creation or lack of creation of the Maquis.<br />I Am Become Death by Franklin Thatcher ***** - This author created here an especially intriguing tale of Data in the far distant future and his altered perspective on how things should come about.<br />Deep Space Nine<br />Research by J. R. Rasmussen *** - This is extraordinarily short, short tale is intriguing at best, from the humor standpoint.<br />Change of Heart by Steven Scott Ripley ***** - This is another of the extraordinarily well written stories of this anthology.  The author here has perfectly captured the perceived personality of a \\"Changeling\\" who's found her self in a particular situation she doesn't care to be in.<br />Star Trek Voyager<br />A Ribbon for Rosie [Grand Prize] by Ilsa J. Bick ***** - It is of wonder that this author won the Grand Prize based on this outstanding tale about Seven of Nine making an unheard of trip into the past.<br />Touched by Kim Shear **** - This is an interesting tale about two Voyager crew members forced to land on the planet of a non warp species and their chance meeting with one of its inhabitants.<br />Almost...But Not Quite by Dayton Ward ***** - This is another of the finest stories of this anthology.  Thisauthor has a fluid and deft style of writing that is captivating and compelling.  Capitalizing on Starfleet's Department of Temporal Investigations and agents Lucsley and Dulmer, the author deftly integrates them into the fold when Voyager ended up in orbit of Earth in the year 1996.  It is no small wonder why this author has moved on to writing professionally!<br />The Healing Arts by E. Cristy Ruteshouser & Lynda Martinez Foley ***** - These two fine authors present here an exceptional story of a medical crisis and the Doctor's solution.<br />Seventh Heaven by Dustan Moon ***** - This is a beautiful story about Seven of Nine and a surprise visit by another well known Borg who had earlier regained his individuality.

After years and years of requests to do so, Pocket Books and Paramount were finally able to come up with a way to publish fan fiction which culminated in this, the first of the Strange New Worlds anthologies.  Prior to this Id had only one other experience with fan fiction which I found to be quite enjoyable and I figured this would be the case here and it was.  Although I found a few of the stories to have been somewhat tedious, taken as a whole, Strange New Worlds I is an enjoyable Star Trek experience and I look forward to reading the latest editions of them.  It is interesting to finally now have read through this anthology and have the advantage of a couple years to see which of the authors within were able to become professional writers based on their experience with Strange New Worlds and of course their talented writing.<br />Star Trek<br />A Private Anecdote (Grand Prize winner) by Landon Cary Dalton **** - This is an interesting and very intriguing tale about Captain Pike.  I believe it to be somewhat prior to The Menagerie, Parts I & II.  <br />The Last Tribble by Keith L. Davis ***** - I found this particular story to be quite well written and very interesting as the author takes us through what happened to Cyrano Jones after The Trouble with Tribbles.<br />The Lights in the Sky (Third Prize winner) by Phaedra M. Weldon *** - I found this story to be somewhat interesting as the author brought closure to what happened to Shahna after The Gamesters of Triskelion.<br />Reflections by Dayton Ward ***** - I found this authors writing to be quite fluid and a perfect fit for Star Trek.  It is no wonder at all as to why he continued on from here to being a professional author.  The author takes us to when Captain Kirk died and that split second of time where he looks up and says Oh my and during that time Kirk is taken to the Organians who were originally seen in Errand of Mercy.<br />Star Trek The Next Generation<br />WhatWent Through Datas Mind 0.68 Seconds Before the Satellite Hit by Dylan Otto Krider **** - The author did a wonderful job of capturing Datas style in this particularly intriguing short story.<br />The Naked Truth by Jerry M. Wolfe ***** - This is a great Barclay story as the author takes us through the nervous engineers first away mission in which hes in command.<br />The First by Peg Robinson - ***** - This is a great and very original story as the author brings us into the world of the Enterprise during the Dominion War.  A less technologically advanced species, more specifically one of them shows up in the middle of contested space using technology that would benefit the Dominion greatly.  Fortunately Picard and the Enterprise reach her prior to the JemHadar.<br />See Spot Run by Kathy Oltion ***** - This is a very funny story and again this is why this particular author has gone on to author/co author other published Trek with her husband.  As the title would suggest, the most unlikely of all heroes is about to have his/her day.<br />Together Again, for the First Time by Bobbie Benton Hull ***** - This is an absolutely wonderful tale about Guinan and her arranging the first meeting between her and Picard.  <br />Civil Disobedience by Alara Rogers ***** - The author did a wonderful job with this story depicting the trials and tribulations Q went through to get Picard and the Enterprise through the events depicted in Best of Both Worlds parts I & II.<br />Of Cabbages and Kings (Second Prize winner) by Franklin Thatcher ***** - Out of all of the stories within this anthology, for me this was the best of them.

US	52712162	ROJHDBVRLBEQK	0880382678	395848912	Test of the Twins	Books	5	11	12	N	N	Test of the Twins - An outstanding conclusion!	This final novel in the Dragonlance Legends trilogy not only serves as an outstanding conclusion to Legends but to the Chronicles as well.  I say this bringing into consideration that while, there is a line of separation between the two trilogies, Legends brings actual closure to what began in Dragons of Autumn Twilight.  It is with this last novel that even the authors admit in the Afterword that this would be their final foray into the world they created, at least for a while as history has proven.<br />Test of the Twins, as with Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's five previous Dragonlance novels, is written with such clarity and fluidic style that one finds it difficult to extricate themselves from it for the other trivialities of life until you've completed it.<br />The premise:<br />At the conclusion of War of the Twins Raistlin, the master of past and present along with Lady Crysania, the Cleric of Paladine were at the portal to the Abyss and in the middle of opening it, to further their cause to destroy the Queen of Darkness.  Unfortunately for Raistlin and Crysania, despite his efforts to change history, is bound to repeat it in another form.  Unlike Fistdantilus though, Raistlin succeeds in his bid to enter the Abyss to challenge the Dark Queen and her minions.<br />Caramon and Tasslehoff are ever present in this third novel as well and have an exceptional first section of the book, again dealing with time travel and Astinus the Chronicler of Krynn.  Making a final reappearance is Tanis Half-Elven picking up where he was left off in the first book!  Also making reappearances are Kitiara, Lord Soth and the good and bad dragons of Krynn.  Overall, Legends is an outstanding story of one brother's ambition to save the soul of his brother and in truth finding that it is not his brother's soul he must save.<br />The cover art for this and the other recently re-released novels are exceptionally well done, credit to the artist.  I would highly recommend this seriesand before that, the Dragonlance Chronicles, to anyone interested in outstanding writing, characters of true depth and an overall compelling story that will certainly give pause for contemplation!  {ssintrepid}	2003-03-06

As a personal favorite, I always find stories containing time travel to be an interesting plot line; War of the Twins is no exception to that.  Some would ask themselves how two authors could continue to produce such outstanding stories without tripping up a little, but as of when Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman wrote this second book in the Legends series, they proved that they could consistently write exceptional stories!  As you read through these brilliant stories, you cannot help but notice many of the events or characters created by these two fine authors that in later novels became the main story arc, showing further evidence to their world creating talents.<br />The premise:<br />At the end of Time of the Twins Raistlin propelled himself, Crysania and Caramon into the future and intentionally tricked Tasslehoff, forcing him to ride out the Cataclysm.  War of the Twins picks up with Raistlin, Crysania and Caramon in the Tower of High Sorcery in Palanthas, yet this is not the tower that Raistlin left at the beginning of Time of the Twins.  In order to further his cause, entering the Abyss with Crysania to fight the Queen of Darkness herself and thus become a god himself, Raistlin has taken his group a mere one hundred years or so into the future beyond the Cataclysm.  Here is where we find out how he truly becomes the master of past and present as we are presented with the story of his confrontation with Fistdantilus, the greatest mage who ever lived.<br />As the three stories of this book unfolds, we are treated to how these characters taking up roles in the history of Krynn written in Astinus's Chronicles, lead to disaster.  How the authors dealt with this is fantastic, especially how their knowledge of the events of the Dwarfgate wars ended and their collective attempts to change the history books.  Ever present is the continued severing of the relationship between Raistlin and Caramon.  No longer is Caramon the overbearing and over protective brother of Raistlin, as he's finally seen and understood the true nature of his brother.<br />Further nods to the authors of this excellent novel, as it brilliantly continues this second epic in the world of Krynn.  I highly recommend this trilogy to all who have read the Dragonlance Chronicles and wish to find out what happened with these great characters after the War of the Lance.  {ssintrepid}	2003-03-02

This, the first volume of the Legends trilogy is as stated above, quite intriguing.  Where the Chronicles trilogy propelled the reader through fast paced action and a multitude of characters, Legends enthralls you with captivating intrigue and suspense.  The beginning has a few of the \\"Heroes of the Lance,\\" in the early stages of the book as part of the setup, but then sets off on its own with its primary characters; Raistlin, Caramon and Tasslehoff.  We are also introduced to a \\"Revered Daughter of Paladine\\" in Crysania.  High praises once again for Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman who with this trilogy, prove that they are not limited to stunning action.  One almost questions themselves as to whether the authors were planning this trilogy when writing Chronicles or capitalized on several things they set up in Chronicles.  In either case, they did it perfectly.  The Wizards of the Coast new cover art is quite beautiful as well, even much more so than the original covers.<br />The premise:<br />It is now two years after the \\"end\\" of the War of the Lance.  At the end of Dragons of Spring Dawning, Raistlin went to Palanthas and as the master of past and present he dared the Shoikan grove without fear to enter the Tower of High Sorcery which no one had entered since before the Cataclysm due a curse laid upon it by a black robed mage.  Raistlin has now had two years in the tower to study and become even more powerful than he was at the end of the Chronicles.  He's also been devising his plan for the future...<br />At the end of the war, Caramon and Tika returned to Solace to be married.  Unfortunately for Caramon though, he's fallen on hard times.  Crysania \\"Revered Daughter of Paladine,\\" has some plans of her own as she met with Raistlin and these two begin making their own plans of each other.  The lovable Kender, Tasslehoff Burrfoot gets deeply into the story with humorous antics as well.<br />Combine these characters and small points of the plot and what we have is another outstanding book written by these authors that will compel you to hurriedly pick up the second book of the series, especially with the highly dramatic ending.<br /> I would highly recommend this trilogy, even if you've not read the Chronicles, but it would be good that you do so.  {ssintrepid}	2003-02-22

Given that he is the most prolific of the many Trek authors, he has attained a level in writing these stories that is both fluid and highly intriguing.  Taking cues from a few different Star Trek The Next Generation episodes, where Star Trek The Original Series characters are brought into the twenty fourth century, Michael Jan Friedman carefully crafts a well told STNG story around them.<br />The premise:<br />As fans of Star Trek The Next Generation learned in \\"Reunification part II\\" Ambassador Spock decided to stay on Romulus to help teach members of the Reunification movement the ways of Vulcans.  While on a trip to one of the Romulan Star Empires outlying worlds to instruct Reunificationists in the ways of Surak, Spock is captured by that world's governor.  Fortunately for Spock, the governor doesn't initially know who he has in his possession.<br />As Starfleet learns of Ambassador Spocks capture, they dispatch the Enterprise commanded by Captain Jean Luc Picard, to negotiate the release of the Reunificationists, while hopefully not revealing that Spock is among them.  To help with this effort they send along Admiral McCoy, who has become quite the stodgy old curmudgeon.  Listening in on this communiqué is Scotty.  Scotty, with the help of the shuttlecraft gifted to him by Captain Picard, deftly swipes a Constitution class museum starship and heads off for the Romulan neutral zone himself.<br />What ensues is certainly one of the best Star Trek hardbacks with a solid plot that is both intriguing and enthralling.  I highly recommend this novel to any and all Star Trek fans, especially since the author cleverly blends members of the twenty third century Original Series into a Star Trek The Next Generation story.  <br />The abridged audio tape version, read by Jonathan Frakes is exceptional and well appreciated as it helps three hours go by quite quickly on the highway.  Also to be appreciated is the cover art, which is better than a lot of others in this genre.  {ssintrepid}	2003-02-14

Dragonlance Chronicles is simply stated, one of the finest fantasy trilogies ever written.  As an inaugural set of novels for these two fine authors; Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman set the standard in fantasy writing in the late eighties through today.  I first read this trilogy in 1987 and was astounded by its complexity of characters and the breadth of the tale; it is truly epic in proportion.  I can only imagine the agony readers might've have gone through if they were reading these fine novels, as they were being released over several months.  That is certainly not a problem today, as you can purchase this outstanding trilogy in one set.<br />You will quickly discover that the characters are highly compelling and well detailed.  These two authors have woven a wonderful tapestry in these characters; you will find yourself as elated as they are in their collective victories and as heartbroken in their setbacks.<br />Contained within these pages are Dragonlances core characters that are quite memorable, well after you've finished this fine trilogy and as history as proven, will inspire several Dragonlance novels to follow.<br />Tanis Half-Elven - Who is the leader of the companions.  He is torn between his love for two women.<br />Sturm Brightblade - Knight of Solamnia.  Squire and Knight whose mission in life is to bring honor back to this stoic group of knights.<br />Goldmoon - Chieftan's Daughter of the Barbarian Plainsmen.  Along with Riverwind, her tribal outcast lover and husband, who are both on a quest for truth.<br />Riverwind - Lover and later husband of Goldmoon, whose sole mission in life is to guard Goldmoon.<br />Raistlin - Simply stated, the most alluring character of the whole Dragonlance series.  He is a Mage of astounding power and brother of Caramon.  The reader will quickly find themselves asking as to which side, good or evil, Raistlin is aspiring to.<br />Caramon - A rather large fighter and he feels that it is his sole mission in life to protect his seemingly ungrateful brother, Raistlin.<br />Flint Fireforge - He is a Hill Dwarf who is in his later years.  He has been friend to Tanis for quite some time and an adventurer with the other prime characters as well.  This character plays quite well at times in the comedic role of stodgy old curmudgeon who is also quite protective over the companions.<br />Tasslehoff Burfoot - Tas, as he's referred to most of the time, is a Kender.  Kender are considered to be a nuisance on Krynn, as they are immune to fear and consequently, trouble seems to follow them everywhere.  Simply put, Tas is the most lovable character among the group, as his high spirits and his antics carry the story along quite well.<br />These characters come back together just as the Queen of Darkness is beginning her play to bring evil and darkness down upon the magical world of Krynn.  You will find yourself amiably rambling along with these characters in their adventures to bring an end to this threat.<br />The cover art for these re-released novels is quite exceptional as well.  I highly recommend this trilogy to those who've read it before and to any and all newcomers who are interested in a highly suspenseful tale, inhabited by some of the fantasy genres best characters.  {ssintrepid}	2003-02-14

Dragons of Spring Dawning as state above, is simply an outstanding conclusion to the Dragonlance Chronicles trilogy!  As you will see from the first two novels, these two outstanding authors will have you thoroughly enthralled in this epic story from the very first page of Dragons of Autumn Twilight to the very last page of this exceptional conclusion!  For myself, as I drew to within a hundred pages or so from completing this novel; I experienced a strange sense of sadness, knowing that I was almost done and strangely enough would miss the majority of these characters.  I say a majority due to the fact that a few of them are in the follow up trilogy, Legends.  Margaret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman have such a compelling writing style that will completely enthrall you into the lives of these fine characters.<br />The premise:  MINOR SPOILER<br />Dragons of Spring Dawning picks up right where the dramatic conclusion to Dragons of Winter Night left off, where a major and beloved character is killed, leaving the reader and the other characters with a major sense of loss.  The suspense for the Chronicles trilogy is brought to an even higher level than the first two novels, as it is all coming to the remarkable conclusion and the ultimate meeting of the beloved characters and the forces of darkness which have brought war to the magical world of Krynn.<br />The Dragonlance Chronicles is, simply stated, one of the finest fantasy trilogies ever written and these two authors deserve all the accolades they have received and will continue to receive.  I highly recommend this to any and all fans who have either already read this trilogy or to any newcomers.  Once you're finished with this book and the Chronicles trilogy as a whole, I highly recommend the Dragonlance \\"Legends\\" trilogy.  {ssintrepid}	2003-02-14

Dragons of Winter Night is another resounding success by these two brilliant authors, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman!  They have, with this second novel, once again written a Fantasy genre classic, possessed of a fluid writing style and characters with such depth as to leave you breathless.  The overall grand plan comes more to light, yet leaves you yearning for more while leaving you in awe of their writing.  Simply put this novel, as with the first is highly difficult to put down for anything as trivial as eating, sleeping or going to work.<br />The premise:  MINOR SPOILERS<br />Picking up right where they left off in \\"Dragons of Autumn Twilight,\\" the authors casually tell of how the companions recovered the Hammer of Kharas and have given it to the mountain dwarves of Thorbardin in return for their allowing the refugees from Pax Tharkas to stay there.<br />The companions set out for Tarsis in hopes of securing passage on a ship to move the Pax Tharkas refugees to safety, only to find that the Cataclysm has left Tarsis land locked for the past three hundred years.  Shortly before the companions are separated in Tarsis, Raistlin ominously forewarns that \\"some of us are not destined to meet again in this world.\\"  Forced by circumstances beyond their control, the companions break into two groups heading in different directions.  Both groups possess disparate immediate goals yet are leading towards the ultimate goal of defeating the Dark Queen.  Along the way we're introduced to some wonderful new characters and reintroduced to characters thought to have been left behind.<br />What follows from this point as stated earlier, is another fine addition to the Chronicles trilogy, which is so well written as to leave the reader breathless on occasion.  As with the first of this series, I highly recommend this second book of this outstanding trilogy!  {ssintrepid}	2003-02-09

I first read this series back in the late eighties and at that time thought it was simply the best fantasy series I'd ever read.  A re-read of this the first novel, simply reconfirms that opinion for myself.  To think what Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman started here with Chronicles is simply astonishing, considering the number of novels released since this outstanding series started it all!  <br />From what I've read, they and a few others were playing a game of Dungeons and Dragons and came up with the idea for this first of many series.  In doing this, they too must've been amazed at how good their fantasy writing was.  Their style of writing, to say the least, is very fluidic with scene after scene, chapter after chapter flowing into one another beautifully.<br />Back when I'd originally read this and a few of the other early series, for some reason I'd stepped away from the fantasy realm.  I can probably attribute seeing The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Rings to re-instilling a desire to once again delve into this genre.<br />The premise:  MINOR SPOILERS<br />Welcome to the magical world of Krynn where every kind of fantasy and mythical creature is a possibility.  A group of life long companions who, five years prior had chosen to take leave of each other to search in many directions for signs of the ancient true gods.<br />Their time of separation is over and they are reuniting in their home town of Solace.  Upon their arrival, they find false prophets have taken control of their home town and that they are literally at the epicenter of where a new war is beginning.<br />Through chance and fate, they meet with new companions and that that meeting will take them on a whole new quest.  This new quest will bring the group to many strange new places with peril lurking over their shoulders at every turn.<br />What follows from this point for the reader is the first of one of the finest fantasy trilogies written since Tolkien set out to write the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  You will quickly find that every character is extraordinarily well written, with a \\"soul\\" to their words and thoughts.  There are few, if any, dull spots in this story, even as the writers clearly must get the reader from one spot to another, they inject a fair amount of humor and well placed dialogue to do so.<br />If you're a fan of fantasy and have never read this series or, like myself and have read this once before, I highly recommend a first time reading or a reread of this exceptional trilogy!  {ssintrepid}	2003-02-07

I believe that I originally found Ken MaCleod's \\"Cosmonaut Keep\\" on the bookshelf at a store and found the description for it to be extraordinarily interesting.  That being said, I decided to research and find out what the authors first book was.  Upon discovering the Fall Revolution Sequence did not have to be read in any particular order, I decided to order and read the Star Fraction before the others, just to put my own sense of order to it.<br />Upon beginning this book, I found that a sense of order to the book itself was to some extent difficult to discern.  Bear in mind that in several sequences I found the author's style to actually be very exciting and captivating, which lends to the idea that his later books will be very exciting.  For a huge portion of the book though, I found his writing style to be somewhat cryptic, plodding and convoluted in the set up of the action sequences.  This book is replete with varying political and social views that at times will leave your head spinning as to which direction the book is taking you.<br />Overall, this novel for me was a worthwhile read, just not overly compelling.  At some point in time, after some further reflection, I will pick up the next book, \\"The Stone Canal\\" and read it.  The conclusion to this one just doesn't compel me to do so at this time.<br />The premise:  MINOR SPOILERS<br />This tome is about a dismal future of the early 2040's after a brief third world war, the US/UN has taken hegemony over a balkanized world.  The Fall Revolution Sequence itself is an attempt to put an end to this new world order and reunify fragmented nations.<br />A key player in the Fall Revolution is an extremely interesting character by the name of Moh Kohn.  His father Josh Kohn was the one who wrote many of the revolutionary programs that runs the computers of this society, which play a key part in the society.  Moh Kohn himself is a security mercenary, living in a commune who believes in many of the communist ideas.Through chance, he meets with Janis Taine, who is a scientist working on memory enhancing drugs.  This meeting is what basically begins the Fall Revolution.  {ssintrepid}	2003-02-02

Patriot Games is Tom Clancy's third novel, and second in the \\"Ryanverse\\" set of novels.  This novel is a prequel to \\"The Hunt for Red October.\\"  In \\"The Hunt for Red October,\\" Clancy made several key points referring to the events of this outstanding novel, showing that he clearly had a vision for where Jack Ryan was headed, or more succinctly, where he came from.  <br />Tom Clancy established himself as the king of and inarguably the creator of the \\"modern\\" techno thriller in \\"Red October\\" and \\"Red Storm Rising.\\"  To follow this up in \\"Patriot Games,\\" he takes a lower tech vantage point, only using the \\"techno\\" stuff sparingly, and concentrates more on establishing his main character Jack Ryan as a family man.  In doing this, he keenly brought his main character to a human, non superhero level that many readers could identify with.  Overall, an excellent novel that is a \\"can't miss\\" for those seeking to read his later works.<br />The premise:  MINOR SPOILERS<br />Jack Ryan and his family, wife Cathy and daughter Sally are on a working vacation in London, England.  Just as he meets up with his family in a park, he hears an explosion and small arms fire.  Not thinking, but reacting as a former US Marine, he flings himself right into the fray.  While injuring himself in the process and then getting shot as well, he dispatches a couple terrorists and sends the last one scampering away.  Only later will he find that he's just saved members of the Royal family from murder or capture.  Of course, to the British and members of powers that be in the United States, Dr. John P. Ryan is a hero, through and through.  Unfortunately for him and his family, he's crossed paths with a terrorist's cell, which turns their undesirable attention on him and his family.<br />What follows is, one of the most intriguing mystery/suspense/techno thriller novels of its time.  It is especially wonderful how Tom Clancy's weaves his tales around details that are highly enlightening in the \\"shadow\\" society.<br />For those who've only watched \\"Patriot Games\\" the movie, I recommend that you read this book.  While the movie is excellent in its own medium, it doesn't contain the full richness and clarity of this excellent novel and the ending is much more fitting!  {ssintrepid}	2003-01-22

From Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising collaborator and best selling novelist in his own right, in his first novel Red Phoenix, we are treated to Larry Bond's second masterpiece in military/political thriller fiction in Vortex.  Larry Bond once again proves his research capability in his studies of all of the cultures of South Africa and their strengths and differences.  He has once again, melded his research, his fluent and poignant writing style into a classical work of fiction.  In Vortex, he has essentially taken almost every conceivable aspect of a world crisis situation and crafted it into this masterpiece.<br />Where Tom Clancy draws all of the accolades and acclaim, Larry Bond continually produces superb military/political thrillers that are of the same caliber and in the case of Vortex, much larger in scope and overall detail.<br />If you're a Tom Clancy, Harold Coyle, Dale Brown, Stephen Coonts, or one of the many other fine military/political thriller author's fans, you would do well to pick up on Larry Bond and his superior work.<br />The premise:<br />Taking into consideration that this novel was written in the late 80's and early 90's, Larry Bond absorbed the headline news of the time to craft a conceivable real world situation where the boiling point of South Africa could've turned into the very Vortex, of the title, and brought the entire worlds attention to its internal struggles.  There could've been no more apropos title for this novel than \\"Vortex.\\"  Vortex as defined in the Webster's dictionary (A situation regarded as drawing into its center all that surrounds it.)<br />Essentially, Vortex is the story of one man's twisted desires to bring total apartheid to its maximum fruition in Karl Vorster.  Through chance and his own machinations, he effectively seizes control of the South African government and begins to bring to realization his perverted dreams of total apartheid and the destruction of his opponents or anyone else who gets in his way.  Given South Africa's mineral wealth and that strategic importance to both Western and Eastern powers, this quickly draws their collective attentions.<br />What follows is a tour de force of flurried action, suspense and outstanding military fiction, which brings many players to the table to include; the United States, Britain, Israel, Russia, Cuba and Libya.  Hence the title of \\"Vortex.\\"  Where these many players are all drawn to South Africa and its mineral wealth.  {ssintrepid}	2002-12-29

The mission:  intercept and detain a smuggler that is supposed to be heading towards those coordinates.  That smuggler is supposed to be smuggling plasma beam weapon technology.  Once the Enterprise arrives, they discover the Badlands which to this point had not been discovered by the Federation.  Captain Kirk is given credit for naming this space phenomenon \\"The Badlands.\\"  Captain Kirk eventually finds himself dealing with a Romulan smuggler, a Klingon D-7 cruiser and a mysterious radiation that is affecting his crew.<br />Part 2<br />Star Trek The Next Generation<br />Part two takes place in 2368.  The Enterprise is ordered to survey the Badlands.  Once there, Captain Picard dispatches Commander's Riker and Data in the shuttlecraft Hawking to explore the Badlands.  Upon completing their survey, they discover that their navigational grid is down and have to find a way out of the Badlands and back to the Enterprise.  Unfortunately for Riker and Data, the warp and impulse engines are down and they encounter the Cardassians who gladly insist on helping them.<br />Overall, these first two stories are extremely well written, albeit short, Trek stories that are in good keeping with Susan Wright's excellent writing style.  She has definitely become one of the top Trek writers.  In reference to some of the other reviews, the minor mistakes that are pointed out, are exactly that, minor and easily dismissible.

US	52712162	RG9YCMZZ21MNA	0425110427	427090647	Team Yankee	Books	5	52	54	N	N	Team Yankee - Step into the cupola!	To say that Team Yankee is a high speed, low drag, and intense military thriller would be a vast understatement!  This is an in your face, action packed, combat thriller that is hard to put down once you've started it.  Being a former soldier, Harold Coyle knows what being a soldier is about.  Armed with a VMI education and seventeen years of Active Duty in the US Army, the author set out to write a military thriller about a possible European, NATO/Warsaw Pact conventional conflict.  He quite successfully accomplished that mission with Team Yankee, in flying colors!  He has a particularly good writing style that is very fluid and doesn't get bogged down heavily in the details.<br />Team Yankee begins with a succinct set up as to why the conflict starts.  He then flows perfectly into the nuts and bolts of a very likely scenario of how a conventional WWIII would've begun in the mid to late 80's.  The story concentrates heavily on Captain Sean Bannon, commander of Team Yankee which is a detached armor team with mechanized infantry attached to them.<br />Along with the highly intense initial combat scenarios, there are the harrowing evacuation scenes of his wife Pat, their kids and the other dependents of Team Yankee!  These scenes are exceptionally well written and will leave you exhausted.<br />The author puts on display a great many things that can happen during war, to include the \\"fog of war,\\" where there are times when communications are cut and Company Commanders have to totally wing it and pray for the best.  He flawlessly displays the entire gamut of emotions that Captain Bannon and the other soldiers are going through, throughout the entire novel.  In essence, this novel puts you in the Tank Commanders cupola completely and thoroughly.  The dialogue is tremendously well written, along with well detailed explanations for the \\"plans\\" of attack or defense.  As an added bonus, there are detailed graphics with the proper symbols for units' friendly and enemy alike.Thank God this is a work of fiction and humanity did not have to face the brutal realism in this book!<br />Not since I read Tom Clancy's \\"Red Storm Rising\\" or Larry Bonds \\"Red Phoenix\\" have I read a military action thriller written this well.  If you're into military/action thrillers, this true treasure is one you need to add to your library.  It took me a while to locate a decent copy of this book and it was well worth the search!	2002-12-11

Part 3<br />Star Trek Voyager<br />Part 3 takes place 2371, just prior to Voyager being torn out of the alpha quadrant to the delta quadrant by the Caretaker.  This is another wonderful story giving us a brief back story for several events prior to the events in \\"The Caretaker.\\"  The author takes us there with Chakotay, B'Elanna, Seska and Tuvok as they begin a Maquis operation.  Seska, being a Cardassian spy is trying her best to warn Gul Evek about an impending raid.  She's desperately hoping to successfully foil the raid and be able to leave the Maquis.  Unfortunately for her and Gul Evek, the Maquis raiding force is afflicted with the same type of damage that Captain Kirk's Enterprise and Captain Picard's Enterprise had taken.  Chakotay's ship isn't as seriously damaged and Chakotay takes advantage of an unprotected Cardassian station.  We follow Chakotay and crew right up to the point their taken by the Caretaker.<br />We catch up with Captain Janeway just as she's taking Voyager away from Deep Space Nine.  She's on her way to the Badlands to find the Maquis ship with her Chief of Security, Tuvok aboard.  Along the way the Voyager takes a small hit from this mysterious, sub space tetryon radiation.  They then receive a distress call from Gul Evek, his ship took the brunt of the damage from the odd beam and he's preparing to abandon ship.  Voyager of course picks the Cardassians up so they can rendezvous' with Gul Dukat to transfer the survivors.  She puts Gul Evek into a particularly interesting light, where though he's the enemy, you truly feel sorry for him.  Just after transferring the survivors, Captain Janeway has the ship in the Badlands searching for the Maquis and then the infamous coherent tetryon beam takes them to the gamma quadrant!<br />This third story in the series is exceptionally well written.  A lot of the plot line for this one is seamlessly tied into canon from the episodes.  Magnificent story!<br />Part 4<br />Deep Space Nine<br />Part 4 takes place in 2373.  Captain Sisko has just finished closing off the Maquis base in the Terikof Belt.  Odo has just gone through the experience of the baby changeling and its death, the baby consequently giving him his morphing ability back.  Bashir has been captured by the Jem'Hadar and there is a changeling in his guise on Deep Space Nine.  Odo determines to find out where the baby changeling had been injured by the tetryon radiation that killed it.  Through his usually tenacious investigative process he finds out that the baby changeling had been discovered near the Badlands.  Given Captain Janeway's discovery three years prior that the Badlands anomaly is in actuality a Romulan Artificial Quantam Singularity (AQS) that was released when the prototype Romulan Warbird was destroyed in part one of this great story, Odo enlists Captain Sisko's aid to track it down and remove the threat.  Along the way, we're treated to a young Tal Shiar commander of a Romulan scout ship that itself is sent to capture the AQS and use it for their own little plan.  We are also treated to Weyoun and a couple Jem'Hadar ships carrying out the pre invasion negotiations with Gul Dukat.<br />This is a stunningly well written story and closer for this great four part, two book series!  Susan Wright has with these two book proven that she can write well for any of the four series!  Of the four stories though, I would say that the Deep Space Nine is the best!  Of no doubt, I would recommend these two books to any Trek fan!kes place in 2373.  Captain Sisko has just finished closing off the Maquis base in the Terikof Belt.

US	52712162	R3F2CGJL82BO5X	0671028405	327925438	The Lives of Dax (Star Trek Deep Space Nine)	Books	5	20	20	N	N	The Lives of Dax is one amazing anthology!	Ezri - \\"Second star to the right...\\" by Judith & Garfield Reeves-Stevens<br />This is a wonderful short story about Ezri running into Vic Fontaine in the holodeck, when she was expecting Julian; unfortunately he's called away for emergency surgery.  She breaks down somewhat and tells Vic about the circumstances surrounding her becoming the current Dax host.  She then begins to impart the stories of all the previous Dax hosts.......<br />Lela - \\"First Steps\\" by Kristine Kathryn Rusch<br />This fantastic short story is, of course, about Lela, the first Dax host.  This is an excellent story, which recounts Lela's experience as a junior member of the council.  It covers her meeting T'Pau of Vulcan.  The story beautifully covers how Trill finds that it must overcome their desire for isolationism and embrace the knowledge that the Vulcan's are more than willing to impart upon them about their neighbors in the galactic neighborhood.  This is a wonderfully well written story.<br />Tobin - \\"Dead Man's Hand\\" by Jeffrey Lang<br />Tobin, Dax's second host is kind of unsure of himself and a little nervous.  He's is on a human ship, the Heisenberg.  The ship is mostly manned by humans, but has one Vulcan, Skon.  He befriends Skon.  This story takes places during the Romulan, Terran war.  The Romulans seize control of the ship, Tobin and Skon set out to free the rest of the crew and save the ship.  This is a great short story that adds some interesting lore to the Dax character.    SPOILER - The author makes it such that Tobin/Dax were the first to be transported and also that Skon and Tobin are the ones that suggest to Starfleet the idea of being able to separate the engineering and primary hulls.  Great story!<br />Emony - \\"Old Souls\\" by Michael Jan Friedman<br />\\"Old Souls\\" is another extremely well written story by one of Star Trek's top authors.  Emony is a champion gymnast who is now a judge for interstellar competitions.  She happens to be on Earth for one held at Ole Miss,where a certain young man by the name of Leonard McCoy happens to be attending college.  A great story that sets the non canonical back story that Emony Dax and the circumstances of this story are what inspires Leonard McCoy to take up his father's profession as a Doctor.  Great read!<br />Audrid - \\"Sins of the Mother\\" by S.D. Perry<br />\\"Sins of the Mother\\" is a heartfelt and somewhat frightening story that heralds S.D. Perry's debut in the world of Star Trek.  This wonderful story is written in the form of a letter from Audrid Dax to her daughter, detailing the events of her father's death after several years of estrangement between the two of them.  A truly well written story and I'm certainly looking forward to S.D. Perry's future endeavors in the world of Star Trek and the Deep Space Nine relaunch series!<br />Torias - \\"Infinity\\" by Susan Wright<br />Susan Wright as usual, does a wonderful job of giving depth and feeling to what we already knew of Torias having been killed in a shuttle accident.  She skillfully entwined a lot of emotion and depth of character into such a short and tragic story.  Another great piece of \\"Trek\\" fiction by this author!<br />Joran - \\"Allegro Ouroboros in D Minor\\" by S.D. Perry & Robert Simpson<br />This is a wonderfully well written story detailing how Joran, the murderous sixth Dax host was stopped and Dax's memories suppressed.  S.D. Perry is obviously going to be one of the top Trek/DS9 writers and I believe this is Robert Simpson's first foray into the world of Trek.  This story could've easily been expanded into a full length novel.  It would be very nice to see these two fine authors team up for a murder/mystery Trek novel.<br />Curzon - \\"The Music Between the Notes\\" by Steven Barnes<br />From the author of the wonderful novelization of \\"Far Beyond the Stars,\\" we are treated with another fine story!  This short story is about Ambassador Curzon Dax and a young Ensign Sisko being in the middle of a trade negotiation and Curzoneducating that young Ensign in the ways of the universe.  My only minor complaint about this story is that this anthology is written in the format of Ezri Dax telling the stories of all of Dax's hosts to Vic Fontaine.  This story is written from Benjamin Sisko's perspective, therefore making this story somewhat out of context.  Who cares though, great author and a great story!<br />Jadzia - \\"Reflections\\" by L.A. Graf<br />I have in the past found the L.A. Graf writing teams efforts somewhat hit or miss.  They score a huge hit with this effort.  \\"Reflections\\" is a wonderfully well thought out and scripted tale about Jadzia being forced to go home to Trill because her sister is in huge trouble.  Her sister Ziranne, a school teacher, never wanted to be a joined Trill, yet she shows up in a hospital with an implanted symbiont.  Absolutely great story!<br />Ezri - \\"... and straight on \\"til morning.\\" by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens<br />This is a poignant closer to this outstanding anthology about \\"The Lives of Dax.\\"  It also, as with the episodes, leaves you wondering what Vic Fontaine is all about along with leaving you with that feeling that Ezri has worked out her emotional distress about not wanting to be joined.<br />Marco Palmieri and all of the authors deserve a huge round of applause for their efforts on this Star Trek masterpiece.  I would recommend this to any and all Star Trek/Deep Space Nine fans.	2002-12-03

He quickly surmises that the only prospect he has of stopping the destruction of his home world is to enlist the aid of Captain Calhoun and the USS Excalibur, hence the title \\"Dark Allies,\\" considering the previously established animosity between them.<br />In \\"Dark Allies,\\" we are treated to another finely crafted furtherance of the New Frontier series and the goings on aboard the USS Excalibur.  As I've stated in previous reviews of these novels, one of the things I like about how Peter David sets the story up is how he starts them off with, more or less, a historical chapter.  \\"Dark Allies\\" is no different in this aspect... \\"Twenty years earlier\\" - Dark Allies begins on Rolisa, a small out of the way planet which is subjugated by the Thallonian Empire.  We are introduced to the Black Mass that had been eluded to somewhere in one of the first four books, and brought to the forefront at the end of \\"The Quiet Place\\".  The Black Mass is in the process of destroying Rolisa and aboard a Thallonian war vessel, a young Si Cwan is with his uncle, Sedi Cwan who is in command of the fleet.  Sedi Cwan and the Thallonian fleet quickly discover that they can't even get the attention of the Black Mass and watch in horror as it devours an entire solar system.  Imagine the impression this put on a young Si Cwan.<br />\\"Now\\" - The continuing saga of the USS Excalibur unfolds.  The plotline of Ensign Lefler's desire for Si Cwan; the continued pregnancy of Dr. Selar; the interaction between Captain Calhoun and Commander Shelby; a very good scene with Commander Katerina Mueller, a great character from \\"Once Burned,\\" carried over to the Excalibur; Ensign Janos gets a really good and funny scene; the story line between Xyon, Captain Calhoun's son and Kalinda is really well written, and finally Si Cwan gets somevery good lines in this one.<br />One of the great things about the New Frontier series and Peter David's excellent writing is the fact that he's allowed a lot of freedom with this series.  In reading these great books, you will encounter character interactions that are simply not possible with other stand alone Star Trek novels.  Peter David also does a good job of writing humor into these books, even in situations where you wouldn't think there should be humor, you find yourself laughing through and saying, \\"that was a good scene.\\"  One final note, the cover art for \\"Dark Allies\\" and its predecessor, \\"The Quiet Place\\" is outstanding.  Thank you once again to Peter David for another great read.	2002-11-26
US	52712162	R1PHS7AH122THD	067102079X	616254162	The Quiet Place (Star Trek New Frontier, No 7)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Star Trek New Frontier No 7 The Quiet Place	As is usual with this series, Peter David's writing is very strong.  This is an intriguing and enthralling story, which like most, if not all of Peter David's stories, is a page turner that is very hard to put down.  The premise:  The Quiet Place, most of all, is the realization of Si Cwan's quest to find his sister.  Previous New Frontier novels have established that Zoran, Si Cwan's childhood friend, turned traitor, had kidnapped and hidden his sister Kalinda.  The Quiet Place begins with Kalinda, who doesn't know who she actually is, living on a backwater planet name Montos, going by the name of Riella.  She's living with Malia, whom Riella (Kalinda), believes to be her mother.  There are some very interesting scenes here.<br />We also meet Xyon who is an adventurous young man, who in his first chapter, is in a very dire situation.  He's about to be put to death.  As you read about Xyon, you almost get the impression you're reading about Captain Calhoun.  We're then introduced to the Dogs of War.  Only Peter David can convincingly create this warrior race of genetically engineered dogs and write them into a story so well.  Throw in the Redeemers and what we have here is not only one of the best New Frontier novels written, this one falls into the category of one of the best Star Trek books ever written.  As is usual with this wonderful series, it ends with the big bold To Be Continued.....  This was of course preceded by a shocking discovery.  Thank you very much to Peter David for this excellent addition to the New Frontier Series.<br />MINOR SPOILER - One note of interest, in past New Frontier novels, Peter David fairly well detailed the Redeemers as far as skin color, facial features and general demeanor.  If I remember correctly, he had not talked much about their height.  Somehow, I never figured the Redeemers to be somewhat similar to Star Wars Jawas, in height at least.  It almost makes them sort of comical, whereas my previous impression of them had beenof average to large bad guys.  This almost makes them funny except that they have some personal abilities that more or less takes the humor right out of these little villains	2002-11-23

I've noticed that other reviewers have complained about the sex scenes in the books.  Oh well, it adds some flavor and character to the series.  Part of Gene Roddenberry's ethos about Star Trek was that he didn't want too much interplay between the main characters like this; the current producers have stuck with that as well.  With one exception, Deep Space Nine.  Look at how that turned out, DS9 was a wonderful show that showed the darker side of life in the twenty fourth century, and for its last two to three years it was almost serialized in that shows lead from one to another as opposed to the stand alones.  That same style is what makes New Frontier what it is, a great series.  The continuous building of characters and plot is absolutely great!  As you read through these books and then peruse the ones you've read, you can see that the author, while telling the current story, is setting up either the next story directly or indirectly setting up a future story.<br />In \\"Fire on High,\\" we have a strange woman who has mysteriously destroyed all life on the planet she's on.  There are some wonderful Commander Shelby scenes, ones you wouldn't have figured the character capable of.  We meet and more or less welcome to the crew Morgan Lefler, Ensign Lefler's mother.  There is the continuing storyline between Selar, Burgoyne 172 and McHenry.   A baby \\"Great Bird of the Galaxy\\" is growing in the warp core.  Everybody seems to be going to the half Romulan, half Vulcan, Soleta for romantic advice, which by itself is very funny.  There are a great many more things here that I do not wish to spoil for everybody.<br />Suffice it to say, Peter David has written another great installment to the New Frontier series, in \\"Fire on High!\\"	2002-11-23

Peter David, as with all of his Star Trek work, does an absolutely great job with this one.  One of the things I like most about the New Frontier books is how Peter David will, as in this one; start off with chapters titled \\"Five Hundred Years Earlier.\\"  He does a great job establishing the basis for the plot.<br />The premise:  \\"Five Hundred Years Earlier\\" on the planet Zondar, a war torn planet.  A prophet named Ontear prophesizes that a Messiah will come from the stars.  A bird of flames will herald his coming.  He will bear a scar and he will be a great leader.  He will come from the air and return to the air.  He will be slain by the appointed one.  The appointed one will be an unknowing acolyte and he will slay the Messiah.  The Messiah's death will unite Zondar.  Upon pronouncing this prophecy, the prophet is taken by way of a mystical storm.  Doe's this Messiah sound like anyone we know!  <br />\\"Nineteen Years Earlier\\" on Xenex.  The young warlord M'k'n'zy of Calhoun faces a challenge that he would prefer not to face.  A widowed woman of his tribe has called on tribal law and preference.  She wants M'k'n'zy to sire her child.  An extremely interesting chapter to say the least!<br />\\"Now\\" Selar, she herself widowed is going through the agony of Pon Farr.  Since she is a widow, this makes for a very interesting story as to who she shall seek out to assist her with relieving the Pon Farr.  We are introduced to the Redeemers, who are from Tulane IV.  They are a race of conquerors, which conquer in the name of their god Xant.  Those who do not follow the word of Xant are basically not worth their time.  Once they conquer a planet they leave behind one High Priest.  This is where Peter David's talent as a writer shows up big time!  The Redeemers have an extremely interesting way to deal with their High Priest being killed.<br />I do not wish to spoil any more for those who've not read this wonderful addition to the New Frontier series.  Suffice it to say that I highly recommend this and the other books in this great series, by one of Star Trek's premier authors.	2002-11-23

I can only imagine how honored he must've been to be able to create a whole new series.  Tasked with this, he stepped up to the challenge and exceeded even his own high standards.  One of the main things I love about the whole New Frontier series is that Peter David is allowed more freedom with what he can do in the New Frontier series as opposed to one of the other lines.  The only question I have about the first four books of this series is why is the series started off with four small books, when this clearly could've been accomplished with two books or one large hardcover?  Either way, who cares, they're all four of them absolutely fantastic!<br />Just like Star Trek The Next Generation's \\"Encounter at Farpoint,\\" Deep Space Nine's \\"Emissary,\\" Voyager's \\"Caretaker\\" and Enterprise's \\"Broken Bow,\\" the four book set or the turtleback containing all four is Peter David's introduction to this great new series!  \\"House of Cards\\" starts off with the introductions to several of the primary characters.  It also includes some great cameo appearances as well.  Captain Jean Luc Picard from the USS Stargazer inspiring M'k'n'zy of Calhoun (Mackenzie Calhoun) to join Starfleet.  Lieutenant Soleta is introduced to the series through a chance meeting with Ambassador Spock, consequently saving her life.  And finally, the ever dreary Admiral Jellico makes his first of many appearances.  Commander Elizabeth Paula Shelby from STNG's \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" is given a first name, a nickname and a history with the new captain.  Ensign Robin Lefler and Dr. Selar are brought over from STNG as well.  Dr. Selar's introduction is extremely interesting.<br />New to the worldof Star Trek we're introduced to:  Captain Mackenzie Calhoun formerly M'k'n'zy of Calhoun from the planet Xenex.  Captain Calhoun is certainly one of the best new characters added to the world of Star Trek.  Zak Kebron, who is the USS Excalibur's Chief Security Officer.  He is a Brikar, a race of beings who are basically built like large, moving landmasses.  Lord and later, Ambassador Si Cwan, one of two remaining members of the ruling family of the Thallonian Empire, which has collapsed.  Which is the cause for Starfleet sending the USS Excalibur into Sector 221-G.  Commander Burgoyne 172, the Excalibur's Chief Engineer.  Burgoyne is a Hermat, which is a species where each individual is pretty much made up of both sides of the battle of the sexes.  An particularly interesting character to say the least.  Lieutenant Mark McHenry, the Excalibur's primary helmsmen, an exceedingly intelligent and of course, eccentric human.<br />Mix all of these extremely interesting characters together with Peter David's well thought out villains and what we have here is an enormously great line of Star Trek novels.  The only downside, they are more or less in episodic format and have a tendency to end with To be continued...., and they're not a regular line coming out with several per year.  The upside, with one exception, they typically come out two or three books at a time.  If you purchase the turtleback containing all four stories, it includes a Star Trek New Frontier Minipedia.  Overall this is a great series that will make a fine addition to your Star Trek collection!	2002-11-22
US	52712162	R96TMS5DACVLO	0671042955	656803042	Equinox (Star Trek Voyager)	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Star Trek Voyager Equinox a great novelization!	Equinox is an excellent novelization of the series season ending and season openers, Equinox Parts I &amp; II.  Diane Carey once again, shows why she is one of the primary authors that John Ordover and Pocket Books goes to for these novels.  <br />The premise:  The starship USS Voyager is cruising along on its merry way back to the Alpha Quadrant when they receive, to their great surprise, a Federation distress call.  This, in and of itself, plays out a huge portion of the emotional intrigue for the crew of Voyager.  When Captain Janeway and crew arrive on the scene, they find the USS Equinox, a Nova class science vessel under attack.  What the starship is being attacked by is not immediately clear though.  They rush in and extend their shields around the smaller vessel and begin to make their introductions.  As one would expect, there is a lot of excitement between the two small crews, considering that both thought they were the only Federation personnel in the quadrant.  What Captain Janeway and the crew of Voyager are soon to find out though is the Captain Ransom and his crew have had a lot rougher go of trying to get home than they have.  I don't wish to spoil this for those that haven't read it or by chance not scene the two part episode.<br />Diane Carey's work on this novelization does deserve a lot of extra credit though.  In many ways, this novel, in my opinion, is more intriguing and exciting than the two aired episodes.  She perfectly captured the inner struggles that the primary characters, Captain Janeway, Captain Ransom and Commander Chakotay are going through.  She truly captures Captain Janeways almost crazed, desire to stop Captain Ransom.  This, by itself, almost costs her the relationship between her and her first officer.  I've read a lot of the Star Trek novelizations and some, unlike this one, are mostly regurgitations of what was seen on the screen.  There's no flair or added scenes to them.  That is not the case with this wonderfully well written book.  I would definitely recommend this one to any Star Trek fan or somebody just getting started with reading Star Trek.	2002-11-19

The premise:  The Enterprise is dispatched to Cragon V in order to compete with the Klingons over mineral rights.  (One side note, this being a pre-warp culture, why were they there?).  Once the Enterprise arrives they discover that the Klingons have been there for sometime and have been giving the locals some weapons and combat training.  They also discover that they have to wait for the world leader, Weyland to get a decision as to who gets the mineral rights.  Weyland himself is an interesting creature.  Since this classic trek novel was published in October of 1990, the author obviously had been watching Star Trek The Next Generation and has come up with a creature who seems to be of the Q Continuum, but without blatantly stating he is.  While on the planet, Captain Kirk, his crew and the Klingons finally meet with Weyland.  The meeting doesn't go well for either side and they decide to depart.  A skirmish begins between the opposing sides and an innocent child is killed along with a one of the Starfleet officers.  Thus begets Weyland's reasoning behind disabling both the Enterprise and the Klingon vessel.  He also hurls three of Captain Kirk's crew into the past.  Scotty finds himself in Scotland in the year 1746.  Sulu is in Japan in the year 1600 and Chekov is in Russia in the year 1942.  Along with Scotty, Chekov and Sulu being thrown back in time, there is a very good story going on between Kirk and the Klingons.  The Klingons seemed slightly out of character for Klingons.  But not to worry, their characterizations only go slightly off the trail as far as how they are perceived as a culture.  <br />As stated above, this is a wonderfully well written and thought out novel.  The only odd thing about this is the author him or herself.  It seems out of all of the Star Trek novels written, this seems to be the only one with this individuals name on it.  Such a shame, she or he writes very well.  Thank you once again to Chapulina R for the reading suggestion.	2002-11-15

US	52712162	R2YLLVSD281UQO	0743412729	607742859	Double Helix Omnibus (Star Trek: the Next Generation)	Books	5	9	9	N	Y	A great Omnibus for a great series!	\\"Infection\\" by John Gregory Betancourt<br />The Enterprise is called to Archaria III, a planet jointly colonized by humans and Peladians.  A new disease has cropped up and is only treatable (the double helix), in a temporary fashion.  The Enterprise supposed to deliver the drug, quarantine the planet and see what help they might render.  What follows is an excellent story, primarily using Dr. Crusher in her quest to find the cure.  The author set everything up very well and wrapped up his portion beautifully.  <br />\\"Vectors\\" by Dean Wesley Smith & Kristin Kathryn Rusch<br />Finally we have a story using Dr. Pulaski, who was unceremoniously dumped from the show.  Not that she was anywhere near a replacement for Dr. Crusher.  It is particularly interesting to see \\"Terok Nor\\" during the occupation and have the interaction with Gul Dukat.  I felt the character development was very good and the Ferengi portions were written very well. The only true complaint is that the author's seemed to have done a poor job of closing out Kira's story.<br />\\"Red Sector\\" by Diane Carey<br />Red Sector is a fantastic story. It's very refreshing having a book that concentrates almost primarily on a non main character in John Eric Stiles. The character is extremely well thought out and written. The author nailed Spock and a hundred and thirty something Dr. McCoy perfectly. I'm dying to find out who the voice is at this point. Hopefully the next three in the Double Helix series will be as good as this one and the other two were.<br />\\"Quarantine\\" by John Vornholt<br />John Vornholt kicks out another fantastic story. Quarantine gives us a good idea of how \\"Tom Riker\\" ends up joining the Maquis. As is par for the course with John Vornholt, he goes into great detail describing a beautiful planet and all of its surroundings. Not a lot of Trek authors do that. I thought Torres seemed a little soft, considering her personality, but that can be explained away. <br />\\"Double or Nothing\\" By Peter David<br />This is another great installment to the New Frontier and the Double Helix series. Not having read the last of the Double Helix books yet, it seems that this one pretty much finishes the Double Helix storyline???? A favorite quote from the book, Riker - \\"I've got to get off this ship.\\" Peter David did an excellent job of integrating Picard and Riker into the New Frontier. It's really interesting and well done how he brought Riker and Shelby together again. That portion was done very well and even better than I'd expected in another meeting of those two.<br />\\"The First Virtue\\" by Michael Jan Friedman & Christie Golden<br />The First Virtue is an excellent conclusion. It pretty much wraps up the reasoning to everything we learned in \\"Double or Nothing.\\" In the First Virtue, we learn why Gerrid Thul wanted to create the Double Helix virus and why he wanted so much revenge for the loss of his only child. Both authors did a great job with their portions. The plot is well thought out, especially the portions of the book with Commander Jack Crusher and Lieutenant Tuvok. I felt that they captured Tuvok's personality quite well and gave a precursor to some of the decisions and general personality we saw on screen in Voyager.<br />Overall, I would recommend this Omnibus to any fan of good Star Trek fiction.	2002-10-30

(Star Trek, No 36)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Worlds Apart Book II	This book certainly has to be one of the most different Star Trek books written.  There is a well thought out plot wrapped in a comedy.  I have no recollection whatsoever of a Star Trek book either preceding or following this book to have a lot of singing in it.  The amazing part about it is that I really never thought a book of this style in this genre would play very well.  I was wrong about that.  As I understand it, this is not exactly the novel the author wanted as a follow up to his earlier novel \\"The Final Reflection.\\"  That said, what he was allowed to publish is different and absolutely entertaining in and of itself.  You will definitely enjoy reading this one.<br />The premise:  The Starship Enterprise is conducting tests on a drone of sorts when they receive a distress call.  The distress call turns out to be from a geological survey ship that had been searching for dilithium.  The ship and its crew had just found an extremely large deposit of dilithium on a planet.  Unfortunately for the ship's crew of three, they had also just been discovered by the Klingons.  In an extremely unorthodox maneuver, the crew hit an escape pod to the planet and the ship heads for the Enterprise on its own.  What follows from here is a very different, yet appealing Star Trek adventure.  It almost play's like a sitcom, putting Captain Kirk in situation's you would not normally expect to see him in.  The author did a wonderful job of this, in making it very funny and not making it absolutely ridiculous and totally out of character for Captain Kirk and gang.<br />For some of the finer and more interesting notes on this particular novel, see Chapulina R's review.  It's very interesting to see what happens when an author and a publisher have a difference of opinion.  Many thanks, once again to Chapulina R for the reading suggestion.	2002-10-27

I had originally picked this one up more as a completist/collector's item.  It's one of \\"The Original Series\\" books I planned on getting to sooner or later.  At the advice of another fan/reviewer I pulled this one off the shelf.  To no surprise at all, this was extremely sage advice.  This is an excellent \\"TOS\\" novel that I would suggest, if you've not read it yet, do so immediately.<br />The premise:  the \\"Enterprise\\" is at Starbase 12 for shore leave and several of the crew members have started reading a recently released book called \\"The Final Reflection.\\"  Dr. McCoy gives a copy to Captain Kirk.  After getting settled back into his quarters, he begins to read it.  What follows is a tale covering the time period of approximately twenty years past the federation's \\"first contact\\" with the Klingons and later.  The primary character being a young Klingon named Vrenn, whom shall later become Krenn.  We are afforded the opportunity to see him go from being a lineless orphan to the Captain of a warship.  His honorable actions put him in place to carry out the mission which inspires this novel.  He truly becomes, in the end, a \\"Thought Admiral.\\"  <br />In this aging, yet very well written Star Trek novel, we see a very well thought out and structured idea of the Klingon culture.  Of course, Star Trek novels being non canonical, much of the author's perceptions on Klingon culture were later disproved by the events of Star Trek VI:  The Undiscovered Country and Star Trek The Next Generation.  This is not to say though that the Klingon culture wasn't like this at the supposed time this \\"novel\\" was written that Captain Kirk is reading.  As Commander Worf stated in \\"Trials and Tribbleations, when asked by Chief O'brien about the difference between twenty third century and twenty fourth century Klingons, \\"We don't like to talk about it.\\"  Once again, an excellent, well thought out, wellwritten novel.  I would recommend &quot;The Final Reflection: to any and all Star Trek fans.  Many thanks to Chapulina R for the reading suggestion.	2002-10-10

I had read this when it was originally released and felt it was lacking.  I recently decided to re read it and give it another chance.  I don't regret that at all.  Imzadi II is, as stated above, as good as or better than the first.<br />The book starts off with Worf dealing with the pain and anguish over Jadzia, his wife, be killed.  Then, it casually rolls over into his reflecting upon his failed engagement to Deanna Troi.  Then we meet again with Tom Riker, Commander William T. Riker's doppelganger, who was created through a transporter accident.  He's living in misery on Lazon II, a Cardassian labor camp.  A result of his joining the Maquis and consequent capture after hijacking the Defiant and attempting to destroy Cardassian targets.  We're immediately hurled to when the Enterprise D was destroyed and everybody is on Veridian III.  Worf makes the decision to ask for Deanna's hand in marriage.  Meanwhile, Riker is speaking with LaForge and decides to tell Deanna he's still in love with her and wants to be with her.  Unfortunately for Riker, he's a couple minutes to late and has to bite the bullet for his friend's sake.<br />From there, Peter David crafted another absolutely wonderful Star Trek story.  It involves several key players from Star Trek The Next Generation and even someone from Deep Space Nine.  One chapter even includes Lwaxana sparring not too successfully with Worf.  This is another fine Star Trek novel by Peter David, a wonderful follow up to the earlier Imzadi and a great addition to your Star Trek library	2002-09-25

To say the very least, Star Trek Vulcan's Heart is one of the best Star Trek novels to date!  We have a betrothal between Ambassador Spock and Commander Saavik.  Attended by a great many dignitaries and a young Lieutenant Picard.  Shoot forward in time, and Spock is well into his research into unification.  Spock receives a communiqu from Commander Charbonek, (the unnamed Romulan to whom he more or less seduced while he and Captain Kirk stole the Romulan cloaking device in the TOS episode).  She warns him of trouble in the empire and is seeking his assistance.  What entails after that is clearly one of the best Star Trek novels you'll ever read.  It includes, the Romulan Emperor; the Romulan Praetor; Ruinek from Vulcan's Forge; Captain Picard in charge of the USS Stargazer; the Enterprise C commanded by Captain Garrett; the previously unwritten story about Lieutenant Tasha Yar and what happened to her after the events of \\"Yesterday's Enterprise; and a great many other people and tie ins that I'll leave to you the reader.

Star Trek the Next Generation stories:<br />\\"Last Word\\" by A.C. Crispin<BR>A very poignant story dealing with Captain Picard's desire to attend Sarek's funeral.  He is continuing to have dreams relating to his mind meld with Sarek.  This story takes place very shortly after the events of Unification parts one and two.  He has recently mind melded with Spock as well.  Overall a very good short story that fills a gap.  A.C. Crispin is one of the better Star Trek writers.<br />\\"Bedside Matters\\" by Greg Cox<BR>A very good short story, basically encompassing Dr. Beverly Crusher's prejudice towards the EMH.  When a situation arise where she has no choice but to use the EMH, she discovers that it/he can be rather useful.  An enjoyable short read by one Star Trek's best authors.<br />\\"On the Scent of Trouble\\" by John Gregory Betancourt<BR>An fascinating tale about the Enterprise in a \\"first contact\\" situation.  They encounter a Pelavian vessel.  They discover that the Pelavians do not communicate in the same fashion as most sentient species.  They are entirely telepathic and scent as well.  What ensues is a very good short story.  A very good read by one of the newer and better Star Trek authors.<br />\\"Life Itself Is Reason Enough\\" by M. Shayne Bell<BR>A very good tale about the Enterprise leading the evacuation of a planet.  The planet's atmosphere is collapsing.  The story primarily concentrates on Lt. Worf and Counselor Troi.  The planet's inhabitants are transplanted Innuit.  I'm definitely looking forward to more work by this author.<br />Star Trek Voyager stories:<br />\\"A Night at Sandrine's\\" by Christie Golden<BR>A very good story, focusing on Lt. Tom Paris, the holodeck and his past transgressions on a woman.  Christie Golden once again proves why she's the go to author for Star Trek Voyager stories.<br />\\"When Push Comes to Shove\\" by Josepha Sherman and Susan Shwartz<BR>An interesting tale about a young alien with an unusual gift.  Along with this young girl's gift, she brings back some memories to Seven.  The two authors are definitely tops in the Star Trek genre and hopefully we'll be seeing more of their work.<br />\\"The Space Vortex of Doom\\" by D. W. \\"Prof\\" Smith<BR>Another great Captain Proton story by the now master of Captain Proton stories.<br />I'd have to say that even though I think the price for The Amazing Stories is a little high.  I would have to say though, that these stories were pretty good.  This more or less offsets the slightly higher price.  I would recommend this to any Star Trek fan.	2002-09-12

The Art of Star Trek is a pure celebration of everything that Star Trek is and was all the way through it's publication date.

If you do some quick cross referencing with the encyclopedia, you'll also discover that some of the &quot;facts&quot; do not match up.  This one is for the collector's, like myself.

It includes brief but worthwhile synopsis's of all 176 episodes, very good notes on each season and a detailed chapter on Star Trek Generations.

Vulcan's Forge, was very deserving of a Star Trek hardback.  They don't just put any of the trek stories in hardback.  Vulcan's Forge is set approximately a year after what happened to Captain Kirk in Star Trek Generations.  Captain Spock is now in command of the Intrepid II, which from what I gathered is one those very small Oberth class science ships.  He receives a distress call from a childhood friend, who is now Captain Rabin, who is in charge of a Federation outpost on a planet called Obsidian.  The star for the system obsidian is in, is giving off lethal radiation, which is, in effect, killing the inhabitants of the planet.  On top of that, there are several cases of what seems to be sabotage against the Federations efforts to improve the lives of the inhabitants of this protectorate world.  The Intrepid II arrives, Captain Spock, Doctor McCoy and several crew members beam down to the planet to meet with Captain Rabin.  What follows is a two fold story where, Captain Spock is remembering the incident of his early adulthood that brought him to the decision to turn away from the Vulcan Science Academy and instead go to the Starfleet Academy.  At the same time we have the present day where he and his childhood friend Captain Rabin is dealing with the very same villain they dealt with as early adults.<BR>Vulcan's Forge is clearly, in my opinion, one of the best Star Trek novels written to date.  The follow up, Vulcan's Heart is just as good a story.  I even purchased the audio tape, which excellent for any three hours I have to spend on the highway.  If you've not read this one, get it and read it, you will enjoy this one very much.	2002-08-31

For several years now I've been reading all of the Star Trek series books in order of release dates.  That said, up to the point in which \\"Echoes\\" was released, with few exceptions, most of the Voyager books left a lot to be desired.  That is certainly not the case with this book.  \\"Echoes\\" is an extremely exciting book that at it's core uses the standard plot line - we're in the Delta Quadrant and we're short on this or that supply, we need to stop and find it - which has been pretty much worked to death by the previous \\"Voyager\\" books.<br />\\"Echoes\\" involves the Federation starship picking up some odd sensor readings, so they decide to investigate.  Once Captain Janeway arrives, she and her crew are instantly involved in a tragedy so large in scale and magnitude, it seems almost unsolvable by one small ship.  The residents of the planet have created a planet wide transporter system, and tied it into the planets core for power.  This has disastrous results.  Like clockwork, the transporter system kicks everybody on the planet over to the next \\"reality,\\" \\"plane of existence.\\"  Where there's a planet, no problem, where there is not a planet, welcome to the vacuum of space.  And so begins one of the more intriguing and better written numbered novels of any of the series!<br />I highly recommend this book to any and all Star Trek and in particular, \\"Voyager\\" fans.  Thank you to the authors for another great Star Trek read.	2002-08-12

Captain Marko Ramius has been planning this since the unfortunate death of his beloved wife.  She was, in effect, left to die due to the mistakes made by a drunk doctor and poor medical system.  He is so confident that he and his officers will succeed that he even sends a letter to the overall commander of the soviet navy telling them pretty much what he's going to do.  <br />So begins the best military/political action thriller novel this reader has ever read.

Even more so than the episode, you can feel for the characters in the book.  It is at times gut wrenching and at other times totally enlightening.  The author captured all of the character's with perfection.  He also captured the 50's era with ease.  A truly delightful book.

At the same time, he's doing everything he can to help his comrades regain control of the station.  Even to his comrades, he appears to be a traitor.<BR>I believe &quot;Vengeance&quot; is in good keeping with the author's latest work.  I really liked this one though.  It has Klingons a plenty.  The humor in this book is right on time.  This is one of those rare trek books, where I found myself laughing quite often.  The character interactions are absolutely great in this book!<BR>At times this is an extremely fast paced book, that leaves your head spinning.  For brief, but necessary, times the pace slows down.  Overall, a really good trek novel and thank you to author for a good read.	2002-07-22

In &quot;Fire Ship&quot; Captain Janeway tells the story of how she was once separated from Voyager.  Believing Voyager was destroyed when she escaped from an alien spacestation aboard an extremely small escape pod.  She's picked up by a less technologically advanced race in the middle of a war.  From there she attempts to warn them that a more viscious species is coming, to no avail.  In order to do something about it, she is forced to basically start off on this ship as a deckhand and work her way up to captain.<br />A great concept carried out extremely well by the author.  Clearly one of the best Voyager books as a stand alone and a fine addition to &quot;The Captain's Table&quot; series.  Thank you to Diane Carey for a great read.	2002-07-21

This was the very first Trek novel I'd read and what a wonderful one to choose.  Probe is the follow up on Star Trek IV The Voyage Home.  The author spins an absolutely great tale as to where the Probe went after it left earth.  Unfortunately it went into Romulan space and of course the Enterprise is sent to follow up on it.  This is a great book for Star Trek fans and those who do not necessarily keep up with trek.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to find out what happened after the Probe left earth.  The author has been absent from the Trek universe for quite some time.  As I understand it, she has one coming out early next year though.  Thank you to author for a great read.	2002-07-21

Another excellent addition to both &quot;The New Frontier&quot; and &quot;The Captain's Table&quot; series.  I particularly like the cover art with the author drawn in the background.  In &quot;Once Burned&quot; we finally get Captain Calhoun's back story about what happened to him on the USS Grissom.  This back story had been eluded to several times in the previous &quot;New Frontier&quot; stories.  As with most, if not all of Peter David's stories, this one is a completely captivating page turner.  In this trek masterpiece, we find out where the tension between Captain Calhoun and Admiral Jellico originated.  A truly exceptional story.  If you've not picked this one up, I recommend you do so before it goes out of publication.  Thank you to Peter David for another great read.	2002-07-21

Of the six Captain's Table books I'd have to say this one comes in a close second to Peter David's &quot;Once Burned.&quot;  I say this because I feel that the character of Captain Sisko is one of the best character's in the Trek universe.<BR>Although there are a few minor inconsistencies in the story, they are not too distracting.  As it happens, a lot of the Trek books released have had them and I do my best to ignore them.  Afterall, the books are not canon.<BR>&quot;The Mist&quot; is an extremely well told story about a race that lives close to DS9 and are for all intents and purposes, cloaked or in another dimension that is only one step removed from the Federations.  What a wonderful concept!  In my opinion, the author's captured Captain Sisko's personality really well.  The character interactions in the bar were particularly good.  Sotugh is a well done Klingon.  The Quilli besting a Klingon was really funny as well.  Overall a great story and thank you very much to the author's for this one.	2002-07-21

When Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) joined the cast of Voyager I thought she was a great addition to the show. Not unlike other people though, I felt she was way over used to the detriment of the other characters and their development. So it was with this trepidation that I approached this book. However, knowing the quality of Christie Golden's past works I jumped right into the book.<br />What a wonderful surprise, Seven on Nine is an absolutely brilliant book with a great plot line and really good villains. In my opinion, past trek books with insectoid species were not done very well. In this the author uses an insectoid species and does it very well. Without giving too much away, let's just say that Seven of Nine is an absolutely great story that is hard to put down. If you've not read it yet, you need to. Unfortunately it appears to be out of publication already. It's definitely worth a little extra money to order this one through [other sources]! Thank you to the author for this one.	2002-07-21

The Captain's Table is a place that transcends time and space.  Only Captain's may enter.  A wonderful concept that is carried to fruition quite exceptionally by Michael Jan Friedman in &quot;Dujonian's Hoard.&quot;  I approached this one with a little trepidation after trudging through &quot;War Dragons.&quot;  Of course, knowing the author, I knew this one would be a lot better.  I was not disappointed.<br />&quot;Dujonian's Hoard&quot; is a wonderful tale with Captain Picard and Lieutenant Worf going undercover.  They intend to find a missing Starfleet officer, Richard Brant who was searching for the hoard and return him to the Federation.<br />This is a really well done tale.  While others might have thought the interruptions from the other bar patrons distracting, I rather enjoyed the character interactions.<br />Overall an excellent story by one of the best authors in the Trek series.  Thank you to the author for this one!	2002-07-21

Devil's Heart, in my opinion, is clearly one of the best Star Trek novels written to date!  Throughout the book, the reader is taken all over history in delightful and intriguing ways.  The author truly captured Picard's spirit and his love for archaeology.  This novel has everything a Star Trek fan is looking for in a book, action, intrigue, mythology and a little mystery.  The author set's an extremely well thought out plot and put's it in place extraordinarily well.  This is one of the few books that I've actually read a couple times.  It is easy to immerse yourself in this story.  In reference to the audio tape read by Gates McFadden, she truly brings the story alive.  I've listened to it countless times on the highway.  The only unfortunate thing about the audio tape is that it's abridged.  If there's ever a Star Trek book to recommend to somebody, this is the one.  If you've not read this one, pick it up in any format you can.  Thank you very much to the author for this one.	2002-07-21

I must admit that I personally was not particularly enthralled with the character of Captain Christopher Pike in the TOS episode.  This was also the first trek book I'd be reading written by Jerry Oltion.  It was with these reservations that I opened this book up to page one.  Upon reflection, these trepidations were completely baseless.  The author, turned for me, what was an uninteresting character, into an absolute page turner.  The idea of the &quot;Titans&quot;, space creature's controlled by humanoids, I thought would be less than captivating to say the least.  Wrong again.  The character interaction's in &quot;The Captain's Table&quot; were extremely well done.  I especially liked the reference to the captain of the Titanic being there.  Without giving too much of the story away and spoiling it for those who've not read it yet, I'll just read this one.  You will not regret it.  I hope the author is given the opportunity in the future to bring this character back to life again.  Thank you to Jerry Oltion for a great read.	2002-07-21

Star Trek:  The Captain's Table Omnibus is a wonderful compilation of some of the best Star Trek written to date!  I originally read all six of the paperbacks and purchased this more as a collector's thing than anything else.  All in all, the whole series is great and in good keeping with the principles and ethos of what &quot;The Great Bird of the Galaxy&quot; intended Star Trek to be.  I do have to admit that it would be nice if one of the better trek authors was given the opportunity to write a seventh book with Captain Archer from &quot;Enterprise.&quot;	2002-07-21

It has some good action sequences and a good plot line.  I'm only giving it four stars though, in light of two problems that both the author and the editor's missed out on.  One, the author repeatedly refers to &quot;The Forgotten War&quot; having been going on for over two hundred years. This is no problem, right up to point in which he refers to Captain/Commodore Lucian Murat's command being during the same time as Captain Kirk and the Enterprise.  Last I checked, there was only approximately a centuries time between Captain Kirk's era and Captain Picard's.  My second minor problem is that the author seemed to have the idea that a Galaxy Class starship like the Enterprise has only one transporter.  I understand his need for the transporter's to be down to move the story along, however, he should've come up with something else besides what he did.<br />As I stated before though, besides the two minor problems, this is a really good Trek novel that is in keeping with the &quot;Great Bird of the Galaxy's&quot; principals and ideas of what Star Trek should be.<br />A really good first Star Trek novel by the author.  He captured the Trek regular's personalities really well and came up with some good characters on both sides of the conflict.  I really liked the Tarn Admiral Jord.  It was especially interesting to see basically twenty century weapons of war being used in a trek book.  I hope this author put's another work into the trek library soon.  Definitely a book I recommend to any and all who read Star Trek.	2002-07-20

Dillard has with, Star Trek:  Insurrection done another great job of novelizing a movie!  I always approach novelization's with a little skepticism as far as what's put on page between the scenes on screen.  That said, I don't really do that with her work.  She captures the spirit of the film perfectly and put's some really good scenes in that we don't see on film.  Thank you to the author for another great novelization!	2002-07-20

The books starts off with the very tragic event's aboard the Farragut.  The entire chain of command is killed, leaving a young Lieutenant Kirk in charge of the ship.  The young Kirk feels responsible for the tragedy and is consequently emotionally hulled.  He is later transferred to the Constitution where he is reunited with his best friend Gary Mitchell.  Aboard the Constitution, his friend has the challenge of getting him back on track emotionally.  When Kirk ends up being in command of the Constitution is a particularly intriguing part of the story.<BR>This was of course another excellent book written by one of the best Trek authors.  It has everything a trek fan is looking for in a book.  Intrigue, action, humor and generally a really good plot line.	2002-07-20

Enterprise begins with Kirk having to go through the gut wrenching process of having to tell Gary Mitchell's parent's about their son's death.  He has the internal struggle of either lying to them to save face or telling the truth and dealing with it.  In this one, we also get the back story of how Kirk was reunited with \\"Bones\\" and invited him to serve on the Enterprise.  The Klingon's in the story are extremely interesting as well.  Overall, another great story by Michael Jan Friedman.  I would recommend this trek trilogy to any and all Star Trek fans who would like to get the back story of the relationship between Kirk and Mitchell.  Thank you to the author!	2002-07-20

Republic starts off with the rehashing of the event's surrounding Captain Kirk's duty to kill his best friend Gary Mitchell.  From there begin's Captain Kirk's telling the history of his friendship with Gary Mitchell.<BR>This is a very intriguing book in that it begin's the whole back story of their friendship.

Cleary \\"Battle Lines\\" is one of the best Voyager books I've read so far.  A good majority of the Voyager books have been, with few exceptions, boring and the same thing over and over and over.  \\"Battle Lines\\" breaks that mold though.  I went into this one hoping and praying that it wasn't that same old, same old and was pleasantly surprised.<br />From the very beginning this one starts out heavy in action and doesn't stop until the last page.  The author's came up with a very good plot and carried through with it very well.  They nailed Janeway and the rest of the crews character's perfectly and came up with some interesting villain's for this one.<br />If you're a fan of Star Trek and Voyager in particular, this is definitely one to get, unfortunately it seems it's already out of publication.  It's definitely worth the money to purchase this one from someone through the Amazon.com marketplace.  Thank you to the author's for this one, hopefully their \\"Maximum Warp\\" books are just as good or better.	2002-07-19

The 34th Rule is simply one of the best Trek books ever written.  Pocket books made a mistake with this one, in that it should not have been a numbered paperback.  This one clearly should've been a hardback.  Once again, another example of DS9 not getting the respect it's due!  That being said, if you're a Star Trek fan and a Deep Space Nine fan in particular, this is a must read.  This book has everything a reader want's in a book, mystery, suspense and a really good plot line that moves with fluidic perfection.<br />Of course, the author's captured Quark perfectly, given the circumstances of the plot.  They really captured Rom and his reactions to the circumstances.<br />I would recommend this book to any and all Star Trek fans.  Overall an excellent read and thank you very much to the author's for this one.  Hopefully they will be teaming up in the future for another!	2002-07-19

While not being one of the best &quot;Voyager&quot; books, this is defintely not among the worst of them.  In fact, it was pretty refreshing in that it wasn't the normal &quot;Voyager&quot; book which is typically based on the old &quot;We need food from this planet and the bad guy's won't let us get to it.&quot;  That said, I rather enjoyed the book, despite what some of the other reviewer's stated about the author focusing too much on Janeway's enjoyment of coffee and the ever present technobabble.  Star Trek in and of itself is based a lot in technobabble, no big deal.<BR>In my opinion, this was an extremely well done first foray into the Trek world by Eric Kotani.  Hopefully we'll see some more trek stories from him in the future.  Overall a well done book and I would recommend it to anybody who reads trek.  Thank you to author for a good read.	2002-07-19

This one is defintely different from the average Star Trek book!  Picard and the Enterprise are dispatched to explore the Dyson Sphere they originally ran into during the television run.  A federation starship run completely by Horta is sent with them to assist and speed up the exploration of the Dyson Sphere!  This is a very interesting story to say the least.  I would have to say I was expecting a little more or something different from this story.  Not to mention the fact that it's at least forty pages short of an average trek book.  That's not say this is a bad story though, it's a decent story overall.  The author's captured Picard and crew pretty well and the Horta were done well.  The villain, a neutron star hurled through a wormhole from the center of the galaxy at the sphere is explained in a somewhat vague way.  This one is defintely for the hard core Star Trek collector/completist.	2002-07-19

That said, it has some interesting verbage and pictures to it.  It is what it is, a small little cash maker for the publisher.

To say the least, this is an interesting way to spend an hour or so on the highway.  As the other reviewers have stated, it seems more like a video game.  The main character gets himself waxed, Q come's in, complain's and runs him back to just before he screwed up.  A decent plot, that get's caught up in the spirit of being a video game, which makes it somewhat tedious.

The First Virtue is an excellent conclusion.  It pretty much wraps up the reasoning to everything we learned in &quot;Double or Nothing.&quot;  In the First Virtue, we learn why Gerrid Thul wanted to create the Double Helix virus and why he wanted so much revenge for the loss of his only child.  Both authors did a great job with their portions.  The plot is well thought out, especially the portions of the book with Commander Jack Crusher and Lieutenant Tuvok.  I felt that they captured Tuvok's personality quite well and gave a precursor to some of the decisions and general personality we saw on screen in Voyager.  Overall, I would recommend the whole series, or the Omnibus that's due out in November to any and all Star Trek fans.  Thank you to the author's for their excellent work.	2002-07-18

Reunion was the first look in novel form at Captain Picard's past, intermixed with his current life aboard the Enterprise.  While I'm not especially into murder mysteries, the author does a wonderful job.  We see here, many of the characters aboard the USS Stargazer that he continues to use in later works.  The characters, in keeping with the authors style, are all very well thought out.  In minor agreement with other reviewer's, I would have to say that the villain's motivations were not really well detailed.  The story does move along very well and it has an excellent ending to it.  Overall a very good book and I would suggest reading this one prior to reading the other Stargazer books.  Thank you to the author for a very good read.	2002-07-18

The Best and the Brightest is right on time.  I read all the Star Trek books in all the incarnations and the ones like this are a real treasure.  To me it is wonderfull to get outside the box of the normal Trek book.  I have to admit that I was initially a little shocked about the lesbian thing, being not normal in the Star Trek books.  It's all good though, being the twenty fourth century, I'm hopeful that by then all the stigma will be nothing but history.  Overall a very wonderful book that gives life to some new characters and intermixes them into some of the events we've seen on the screen.  If you've not purchased and read this one, you're missing out on some of the best work in the Trek world.  This book is in very good keeping with the \\"Great Bird of the Galaxie's\\" ideas, principles and philosophy.  Get this one while you still can before it goes out of publication.

In Q-Space Greg Cox begins an excellent Star Trek trilogy.  Despite some minor continuity issues that the author does not usually succumb to.  On the whole, the trilogy is an absolute must read for serious Star Trek fans.<BR>While Riker and the crew of the Enterprise are stuck dealing with the angry Calamarain, Picard is taken all throughout the history of the galaxy by Q.  The villains are great in this.  Without ruining the trilogy for those who have not read it, let's just say that you will really enjoy it.  The only unfortunate thing at this time is that the second book in the trilogy is no longer in publication.  This is something I'm hoping that Pocket Books will correct as soon as possible.

What can be said about Tom Clancy and any of his novels other than, he knows his stuff.  \\"Rainbow Six\\" is a pure page turner, no if's, ands or buts about it.  As most Clancy reader's know, John Clark is a well developed character in the \\"Ryanverse\\" to include \\"Without Remorse,\\" which gives his back story.  \\"Rainbow Six\\" puts him in a more modern spotlight.  I read this masterpiece not long after it came out, however, on that tragic day of September 11, 2001 this and a couple other of Clancy's novels were what I thought of.  It's literally very unfortunate we don't have these heroe's out there watching our collective backs!  Hopefully for us, the bad guys of the world have never heard of Tom Clancy, for they might get a play book for terrorism.<BR>From the first page to the last this novel, like his other novels, is purely enthralling and you will hardly be able to put it down.  Even if you've never read a Clancy novel before, pick this up if you're looking for pure intrigue, thrilling action and a few good laugh's along the way.

If you're already a fan of the show and haven't read this, you're wrong!  Imzadi gives a (if not canon) complete explanation of how Deanna Troi and William Riker became &quot;Imzadi.&quot;  This novel is completely enthralling from cover to cover.  It details how the two met, fell in love, separated and later became the best of friends.  If you cannot pick this one up in hardback, at least come up with the paperback, this is not one to miss if you've followed TNG from the beginning or if you're new to it.	2002-07-13
US	52712162	RQH8107TV0QZ8	0671501062	823854536	Deep Space Nine Companion (Star Trek Deep Space Nine)	Books	5	1	2	N	N	The best of the best!	What can one say, when you're an avid fan of Star Trek and in this case Deep Space Nine.  Of all the companions for the shows this is clearly the best of them!  A minor exception with reference to black &amp; white photo's instead of color.  It has been known from the beginning of DS9 that it was more or less the red headed stepchild of the franchise.  I and a great many other DS9 fans take exception to that.  Within the content of this companion you will find in rich detail the tapestry that made DS9 what it was, as good as or better than TNG in some ways, and although Voyager was good, it's a long number three to DS9 and TNG.  From complete conversations with the cast and crew to detailed synopses of each episode, one will not want for information on the television episodes.  If you're a true trek fan this is a must for your library.	2002-07-11

This is another great installment to the New Frontier and the Double Helix series.  Not having read the last of the Double Helix books yet, it seems that this one pretty much finishes the Double Helix????  A favorite quote from the book, Riker - &quot;I've got to get off this ship.&quot;  Peter David did an excellent job of integrating Picard and Riker into the New Frontier.  It's really interesting and well done how he brought Riker and Shelby together again.  That portion was done very well and even better than I'd expected another meeting of those two.  Overall another great book by Peter David.	2002-07-01

Another great Star Trek novel by John Vornholt.  Quarantine gives us a good idea of how &quot;Tom Riker&quot; ends up joining the Maquis.  As is par for the course with John Vornholt, he goes into great detail describing a beautiful planet and all of it's surroundings.  Not a lot of Trek authors do that.  I thought Torres seemed a little soft, considering her personality, but that can be explained away.  Hopefully not too much of a spoiler.  Another great installment in the &quot;Double Helix&quot; series and thank you to the author for another good read.	2002-06-18
US	52712162	R8AU0YN241XZB	0399138250	685045441	Without Remorse	Books	5	119	125	N	N	Tom Clancy at his best!!!	\\"Without Remorse\\" is the page turner to beat all page turners.  I brought this book to Korea with me the first time I went there, knowing that I'd have some spare time at the end of a six week tour there.  I was expecting to maybe read half of the book in that time and finish it when I came home.  No way!  Once I started this book, it was done in less that 48 hours.  You simply cannot put this one down for something as trivial as sleeping or eating.  Tom Clancy goes into great detail giving the whole backstory on John Kelly/Clark.  Once you've read this book, you'll be thinking back on all that came before and after it saying to yourself, \\"this is how and why John Clark does what he does.\\"  It is extremely heart wrenching to read what happens to Pam and how John Clark deals with it.  You feel as if you want to be there with him, ready to take out some vigilante justice.  I had originally skipped this one and read his next novel, what a mistake that was.  Even though I knew that John Clark was in the next novel, I kept saying a prayer hoping he doesn't get killed in this one.  That is how good a writer Tom Clancy is.  I don't know if there's such a thing as a writer's hall of fame, if not, there should be one with Tom Clancy right there at the top.  Thank you very much to Tom Clancy for an absolutely great read!	2002-06-16

It's very refreshing having a book that concentrates almost primarily on a non main character in John Eric Stiles.  The character is extremely well thought out and written.  The author nailed Spock and a hundred and thirty something Dr. McCoy perfectly.  I'm dying to find out who the voice is at this point.  Hopefully the next three in the Double Helix series will be as good as this one and the other two.  Thank you very much to Diane Carey for an excellent book, even if I don't understand all those sailing terms your books are replete with.	2002-06-14

The \\"puzzle palace\\" was probably wondering how he figured all this out.  I'd originally read this amazing story when it first came out and was just floored by the realism, the character interactions and the author's knowledge of military operations.  A few years later I was scheduled to go to South Korea on tdy and picked it up to read again.  It was amazing to be reading this book and seeing a lot of the areas he'd talked about in the book, in person.  To see the river's and the rivetments on the banks, to see the tank barricades all around Seoul and all the bases north of Seoul and be reading this book again at the same time.  Absolutely amazing!  Thank you very much to Larry Bond for an excellent book.	2002-06-13

It's quite clear that the author has of love for sailing and historic vessels.  She found a wonderful way to intertwine the 18th and 24th centuries.  It was great to see Alexander make it into a book as well.  Some minor portions of the book were a little hard to swallow, however, if Trek readers want reality they should stick with non fiction.  Thank you to Diane Carey for a wonderful story.	2002-06-13
US	52712162	R1CTGRN5JI7CJJ	042510107X	34724671	Red Storm Rising	Books	5	80	88	N	N	The Best &quot;What if&quot; book ever written.	I had originally picked this book up right at the beginning of Desert Shield.  Being in the Army and working on a post where we were processing soldiers/units to go to the desert and working very long hours.  It took a couple days to get through the first 150 pages or so.  On the day that I reached the chapter where you're sitting in cockpit with the pilot of a stealth fighter and he's going in on an attack run, I couldn't put it down from there.  This was and is the best World War III scenario ever written.  If you've not purchased and read this book, do so immediately!  Thank you to Tom Clancy and Larry Bond for one hell of a book!	2002-06-13

For myself the character from the TOS show really didn't have a lot offer.  Greg Cox turned, for me, an uninteresting character into an extremely well thought out and compelling story.  If you're a fan of the Star Trek books and haven't read this, you really need to.  Greg Cox is a true fan that knows what's been done and how to write a new trek novel.  I'm looking forward to getting to the Eugenics Wars.  Thank you Greg Cox for, in my opinion, one of the top five Trek books ever!	2002-06-13

I started this book, put it down, picked it up again and put it down again.  Due to an extremely demanding job I actually didn't read any books at all for around a year.  I picked this one back up and trudged through it.  There was a good story in there somewhere, the author's couldn't seem to find it and neither could I.  The rest of the Captain's Table books, however, are absolutely a must read for all Star Trek fans.	2002-06-13

That being said, this book absolutely floored me.  I couldn't put it down and read it in two days (if I wasn't working 18 hours a day at that time it would've been one day).  MJ Friedman has with this Star Trek installment, once again, shown why he's one of the top selling Star Trek authors.  Thanks to the author for a great read.	2002-06-13

For me it started kind of slow and I'd even put it down for a while.  When I'd picked it up again and started anew from the beginning, I couldn't believe I'd ever put it down.  This is the one that put Vornholt on the map in the Trek novel world.  Extremely good character development and carry through.  It was wonderful to see Captain Picard in a situation you wouldn't ordinarily think he'd be in.  Overall a huge thank you to John Vornholt for a memorable book.  Unfortunately this one's not on the shelves anymore if you haven't read it, good luck finding it and if you do you won't regret it.	2002-06-11

It was very good to see Dr. Pulaski get in the spotlight, considering she'd pretty much had been written off the show and never made it to the books.  I felt the character development was very good and the Ferengi portions were written very well.  The only true complaint is that the author's seemed to done a poor job of closing out Kira's story.  Overall though a very well written book and thanks to the author's for a good read.	2002-06-10

The author set everything up very well and wrapped up his portion beautifully.  I have to admit that I was a little skeptical about a whole series of books based on a medical crisis, however, I'm hooked and am looking forward to running through the other five.  I'm definitely looking forward to adding the omnibus to the bookshelf later this year.  Thanks to John Gregory Betancourt for a wonderful read.	2002-06-04

I found myself almost ready to put this book back on the shelf and forget about the other two as well.  This is somewhat like a \\"Clancy\\" novel where you have to trudge through some of the minutia to get to the good stuff which is in the second and third books.  I found the second and third books to be very insightful and an extreme joy to read, and in keeping with the authors style of good writing.  In a way, this is no different than a single novel where it starts off slow and finishes very fast.  Pocket books should've put this out in hardback as a single novel, however, sinced KW Jeter's \\"Warped\\" fiasco, they've steered clear from DS9 hardbacks.  I would definitely recommend this small trilogy to any true trek fan.	2002-05-06
