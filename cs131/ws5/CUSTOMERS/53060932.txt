But in Pen on Fire, author Barbara DeMarco-Barrett has combined inspiration and practicality, creating one of the best how-to writing books I've ever read.<br /><br />The subtitle of the book is \\"A Busy Woman's Guide to Igniting the Writer Within,\\" and some of the text definitely has a feminine slant. Women who work, who raise children, who have trouble taking time for themselves, are encouraged to write in any and all available chunks of time. Waiting for red lights, for the water to boil, in the dentist's waiting room, all can be opportunities to get words on paper, or in laptop.<br /><br />But make no mistake - any aspiring writer, male or female, at almost any level, will benefit from spending time with Pen on Fire. DeMarco-Barrett begins on a gentle note, cajoling and urging and promising to guide us into a writer's life, even if it's in 15-minute chunks. She offers suggestions for mining your own life for ideas, for developing your knack for dialog by eavesdropping.<br /><br />She even tackles the touchy issues of whether you should write about friends and family. How much should you make up? How much should you show them in advance? What if they read a journal and take offense? DeMarco-Barrett covers it all.<br /><br />One of the greatest features in this book are the extensive use of interviews of well-known authors, whom DeMarco-Barrett meets while producing a Southern California radio show called Writers on Writing. There may be no absolutes when it comes to, say, discussing a work in progress, or how much plotting needs to be done in advance, or how much research is too much. But it's fascinating to hear from successful writers about how they manage their craft.<br /><br />Each chapter includes a writing exercise, a manageable 15-minute task designed to tackle a specific writing issue. Some focus on possible first lines for a book, on descriptions, and on being more supportive of our efforts. After reading a chapter, some of the exercises are so tempting that it would be nice if this book were produced in journal form, so you could just start scrawling right then and there, without worrying about making notes in the margins or having to find a notebook.<br /><br />Anyone who is interested in stoking their creativity, or finding a muse, or even in how \\"real\\" writers work on their craft will enjoy Pen on Fire. Those who give in and fall under DeMarco-Barrett's spell might even find themselves living a writer's life.criptions, and on being more supportive of our efforts.

The women range in ages and reasons, but all cheated on their husbands and fill these pages with the sagas.<br /><br />There is something exhausting and sad about reading page after page of the dissatisfaction these women had with their husbands. Many married simply because they were ready to have children. Almost all the men were emotionally distant, sexually cold or even cheating themselves, and a few were abusive.<br /><br />Some of the women had several affairs. Some left their husbands. One woman had a one-time fling and regretted it. A few warn, even beg, women readers not to cheat.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine so  many women are so unhappy, that this is so common that the book somehow reflects reality. It makes one feel jaded and cynical, even kind of trashy, to steep in the sadness and the sordid stories.<br /><br />That said, a person struggling with issues of fidelity or marriage may find something profound within the pages. The editors have certainly captured many different stories, and the stories are well-written and compelling, if very sad.<br /><br />It might not be a book to give to a newly engaged friend, but a fine book to give to someone dealing with the issues of infidelity.	2005-09-29

Because it doesn't take long to get into the degradation and peer pressure that the Greek system tries very hard to keep under wraps.<br /><br />Alexandra Robbins has written a book that should be required reading for all parents of college-bound daughters, university officials and students. It's a well-written and eye-opening look at a large segment of American college life.<br /><br />Robbins reveals sororities' darkest secrets: date rape, racism, cheating, hazing, abuse, eating disorders, alcohol abuse. By following four sorority sisters and infiltrating herself in their lives, Robbins had access that most writers and journalists never have, because the Greek system doesn't cooperate.<br /><br />The book is well-documented, using newspaper stories, legal papers, interviews and reporting from conferences to try to get an overview of modern sorority life. But her first-hand accounts of real sisters are the most incredible.<br /><br />I must admit that I was not in a sorority, so I'm very prone to being an anti-Greek reader. I did attend a school mentioned often in this book, however, and her writings were dead-on from what little I happened to observe during my years on campus.<br /><br />Interestingly, Robbins doesn't advocate a demolition of sororities. She looks to black sororities and fraternities as examples of how to create a better Greek system, and she has ideas for how universities and families can foster improvements and support of women on campus.<br /><br />I thought this was a great book, high on the outrage scale but well researched; brutal but honest and ultimately ending on a hopeful note.	2005-09-25

The author didn't seem to know if she was writing a scathing social commentary on Hollywood and marital pecking orders, or a morality tale on the evils of materialism, or a fairy tale. Some of the characters seemed incredibly one-dimensional -- think gay decorator and shallow ex-husbands.<br /><br />When the book began, I thought I was reading a gripping account of a middle-age woman getting skewered by divorce and finding herself, in the style of First Wives Club. Instead I got a stew of coincidences and attempts at satire.<br /><br />If I try to be generous, I can imagine this book as a sort of Tales of the City for the new millennium, set in LA instead of San Francisco.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, it just kind of falls apart by the end. If you're interested in Hollywood lifestyles, or middle-age women or divorce, it could be worth a read. Grazer writes cleanly, in a conversational style with cultural references that make the book timely and fun.<br /><br />But if you think you'll find something profound, The Starter Wife will surely disappoint.	2005-09-19
US	53060932	RBQ77WQCKSBY7	1573223158	394899911	My Friend Leonard	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Brilliant	This book tells the story of a man who has finished rehab for drugs and alcohol, and who is finishing a jail sentence earned while being high on crack. Paying his debt to society and being drug and booze-free, the author sets off to find his vulnerable girlfriend in bitter-cold Chicago, and to create a post-rehab life for the both of them.<br /><br />James Frey is so raw and emotional, his writing seems like a burst of words, as if they are free-flowing and true, just pouring out of him without limits. His words don't come together like someone who is thinking about how to say something, thinking of the best way to write. His words come together naturally and powerfully. They are stripped of nuance, giving him tremendous power as a writer. Everything is laid bare.<br /><br />He cuts through to basics. His details are vivid. His scenes come alive, so the reader feels the build-up of getting to a destination, buying flowers, waiting for answers. Of being cold, freezing. Of falling in love and not being able to make it work. Of being helpless. Of feeling joy. Of being served a feast.<br /><br />In My Friend Leonard, the words tell a story that is so fascinating that if it were fiction, it would seem far-fetched. Leonard is a character worthy of his own book, and I'm so glad Frey told his story.<br /><br />The combination of writing and story makes it utterly compelling. I was a fan of A Million Little Pieces, and My Friend Leonard is a wonderful second book.	2005-09-03

Her memory is amazing, and her descriptions and writing style are visual and clear and precise.<br /><br />That said, I found the book to be frustrating. She makes it clear that she is not an alcoholic, rather an alcohol abuser, now sober. It seems a rather fine point to put on it, considering the upheaval that she caused in her life.<br /><br />There is a feminist thread running through the book that was interesting. Why do so many young women abuse alcohol? Is it liquor companies and their marketing? Is it sexism at its worst?<br /><br />The book bothered me mostly because the parents seemed so unaware and unworried, beginning when their daughter came home hungover at 14, later had to have her stomach pumped and even later triggered a roommate phone call voicing concern over their daughter's drinking. I wonder how parents could ship this child off to college with a relatively unlimited bar budget. Perhaps Zailckas, who wrote the book at age 23, is not yet in a place to have enough perspective on her life and her upbringing.<br /><br />Zailckas writes the book as if she is typical. This is a horrifying thought and one that I'm not sure I believe. Alcohol abuse may be a large problem in our society, but I don't believe that a majority of my college peers lived as she did, constantly hungover and unable to make friends or date or have any life without booze.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, it's a cautionary tale and well-written. But in spite of its confessional, honest quality, it seemed to lack any deep sense of personal responsibility.	2005-08-30

Lindsey Boxer goes out with the girls from the Murder Club of past books, and things start out well with margaritas and chit-chat.<br /><br />But she gets called to a stake out, and the next thing she knows, Boxer is shooting two juvenile suspects who had shot and hit her and her partner.<br /><br />The book tells the story of her defending herself in court against accusations of being a drunk, improper cop. While she's waiting for court, she escapes to Half Moon Bay, where she finds herself involved in a serial killing spree that has the town in a panic. Of course, this spree reminds Lindsey of a long-ago case she never solved. Could they be connected?<br /><br />The book has too many coincidences, making the plot seemed forced and contrived. Some things, like the lawsuit, seemed glossed over and not true in any real legal sense. Even the title seems forced; there is one small July 4 party that seems added in to justify it.<br /><br />But Lindsey is a likeable character, and the book moves about at a quick pace. It doesn't stand up to intense scrutiny or discussion, but it's well-written with interesting women characters and enough grim, sadistic crime to give it a creepy feeling.<br /><br />Mysteries can be better than this book. But it's worth a read, if you don't expect too much and just go with the flow.	2005-08-28

Esme Raji Codell ultimately is too smug for her own good in this diary of a first-year teacher in a poor, urban elementary school classroom.<br /><br />In the beginning, her attitude is honest and refreshing and bold. She describes her job interview, her bullet-ridden classroom, her mentors, her ideas, her students.<br /><br />Readers might wonder why more teachers aren't like her. Where are the other teachers' travel machines, gorgeous classroom libraries with books collected from interesting travels, who arranged for visits from children's authors, who dreamed up great songs and dances for school assemblies?<br /><br />Madame Esme, as she insists on being called much to the administration's chagrin, has a real sharp sense of humor. When a student calls the inept principal a slur for homosexual, she replies, Don't insult homosexuals. When someone tells her she dresses like a whore, she remembers her youth, and how glamorous the whores looked, like they were going to a party, and she replies with a \\"Thank you.\\"<br /><br />But in the end, tale after tale, example after example, of everything she does right, everything others do wrong, it just wears the reader down. It's very clear she's a good teacher. Because, she tells us every page.<br /><br />Sure, some of her anecdotes are touching, like when she almost yelled at a student for being late, but instead asked quietly for an explanation. The student was at a shelter that week, and Madame Esme was glad she didn't yell.<br /><br />Teaching students who are homeless, who have parents in and out of jail, who will bring toddeler sibilings to class to protect them from their homelives, who have langauge barriers, well, that can't be an easy job. It's fascinating to have an opportunity to see inside such a classroom, and witness a teacher who is successful. It gives a sense of hope.<br /><br />It's a pity that the author couldn't reign in some of her self-congratulations.	2005-08-21

But the story that ties them together is very awkward and the poems gimmicky. Haunted might have worked better as a short story collection.<br /><br />Haunted is not a book for the squeamish. Some of the stories are graphic and stomach-turning, describing things like masturbation mishaps that end up with teen-agers hospitalized for bladder surgery. Other stories are fantastic satire. It may be worth reading the entire book in order to read the story Slumming, a tale of rich social climbers who act homeless because social diving is the new social climbing.<br /><br />One has to admire a writer who goes on a precipice the way Chuck Palahniuk does in Haunted. His writing is sharp, biting, compelling, and socially astute.<br /><br />But the book is exhausting, too, and at the end not as thought-provoking as one might hope from a writer this talented.	2005-07-30

The first few pages matter-of-factly describe Kathy's work as a \\"carer\\" and her patients, or \\"donors.\\" At first, a reader may wonder if this is some English medical jargon, akin to calling a Band-Aid a plaster. But the story unfolds, and everything becomes explained, crystal clear and murky all at once.<br /><br />In a series of recollections, Kathy describes her school days, particularly her friends, bossy Ruth and hapless Tommy. She describes the guardians, the lifestyle, the interesting emphasis on why Hailsham students never, ever smoke cigarettes, and why they will never have jobs such as movie stars or office workers. But many of her memories are simple, fraught with meaning but mundane.<br /><br />The stark tale, which tackles complicated ethical issues of modern science, is told with complete acceptance, although there are tears and plenty of bleak, hopeless moments.<br /><br />Ishiguro has written a compelling book, full of moral implications. It is not a book that preaches by knocking the reader over the head with grim details. No, this is a book that explores the nature of humanity, of the soul, of love, and of how far we will go to improve our lives. It's a poignant tale that is partly coming-of-age, partly a complex love triangle, and partly a sci-fi extravaganza.<br /><br />It's a complicated book that is hard to put down, and hard not to keep thinking about long after the reading experience is complete.	2005-07-27
US	53060932	R76QD60ZJS6NM	0670034118	289140196	The Wonder Spot	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Meet Sophie Applebaum	Sophie Applebaum is not the perfect girl. She misses chunks of Hebrew school to hang out in the ladies' room with a girl she doesn't particularly like. She messes up the kosher dishes in her brother's New York apartment. She can't get to work on time. She can't keep an apartment. Her grades are poor; boyfriends play her for a fool.<br /><br />Yet somehow Sophie is perfect, as Melissa Bank's collection of short stories reveal. She may not get the best grades or go to the best college or date the most pefect men, but she has a sense of self and a sense of humor that make her immensely appealing. Of all the single-women New Yorkers one meets while reading contemporary fiction (or watching inanities like Sex in the City), Sophie Applebaum seems the most honest and complete.<br /><br />The short-story format is perfect in telling the story of any complicated person, because of course who you are in elementary school stays with you, no matter how far from home you go. The relationships that Sophie has with her parents, grandmother, brothers and old friends all reveal how much she's changed, and also stayed the same. They show Sophie finding her voice, as she goes from thinking things to herself, to sharing them with her brothers, to incoporating them into her actions, and her choices.<br /><br />By the end of the book, Sophie is beginning to feel a sense of peace in the world that was unimaginable to the readers who met her during college, or just after. Her separate stories add up to something much larger that the parts.<br /><br />Ultimately The Wonder Spot doesn't deliver a knock-out punch, but it doesn't seem to aim to that. What Melissa Bank succeeds in is creating a work that is nostalgic without being sappy; hopeful without being sacharine; aware without being arch.<br /><br />This is chick-lit without the silliness and with a nice dose of healthy introspection.	2005-07-25

Kelleher and his colleague, Maureen McGuire, chase the story over the next few days as it twists and turns and ends in a dramatic climax.<br /><br />Kelleher is a likeable reporter, and Feinstein nails the dynamics of newspaper politics. Editors, publishers and assorted staffers are described perfectly, and he gives a real sense of competition among daily papers and the reporters out digging for new leads. Some elements of the plot strain the reader's credulity, however, and the various conspiracies take a lot of concentration to track. Nonetheless, it's an interesting and fast-paced thriller.<br /><br />At times the writing seems a bit awkward, with maybe too many inane details and sexual situations. But overall, it's a great first work of fiction from a talented writer. A sequel would be interesting, now that Kelleher's character is established. It would be fascinating to see what he covers next, and how long his editors' happiness with him lasts.	2005-07-21

The book is tense with plenty of devastation and far fewer bright spots than earlier books in the series.<br /><br />In Half-Blood Prince, Harry and friends get their O.W.L. test results and resume advanced studies, social activities and of course Quidditch. But schoolwork is tougher than ever, puppy love leads to complications amongst friends, and Quidditch, well, Harry may be team captain, but he's never seemed less interested in fun and games.<br /><br />The book moves along at a nice pace, something Rowling is very good at. But she spends a lot of time revealing history and answering questions. It seems very much like Part I of a two-part finale. It was disheartening to see how clearly the book has turned toward an inevitable conclusion. The reader is no longer being introduced to the wonders of magic on each and every page. No, now we see more of the pitfalls and dangers. We see Tonks, suffering depression, losing her ability to make her hair bright pink. We see Dumbledore's injured and untreatable hand. We see friends turn against one another, and painful and tragic betrayal amongst other main characters.<br /><br />This would not be the book to read first if a reader has not enjoyed all the other Potter novels. It's dark and moody and although sad, the ending is wonderful, a great set up for the last book.<br /><br />It's clear Rowling has something big in store for the reader. In many ways, I wish I could have waited until the last book was ready before reading this piece of the puzzle. Because as entertaining and enlightening as Half-Blood Prince is, it seems to me to set the stage for the inevitable ending to the saga. A little intermezzo, if you will, until we get the big, final bang.	2005-07-20

And sure enough, he's quickly up to his broken nose in the latest installment of John Sanford's Prey series.<br /><br />Broken Prey begins with a sex offender on release who is tired of his garbage-hauling job and tempted by the women he sees. Soon, there is a brutal torture-murder, and then another, and Davenport is on the case.<br /><br />The story is complicated and twisted as Davenport goes through various jurisdictions, interviewing doctors, probation officers, small-time hookers, and everyone else he can think of. Familiar faces, including nun Elle and detective Del, are on hand to brainstorm and chase leads. As for new faces, well, there's a rather cuckoo reporter who gets deeply involved in the story when he starts fielding phone calls from the killer.<br /><br />In the end, there are more bodies and gory details, enough to sicken the reader as well as the cops working the case. Broken Prey certainly is a page-turner, with excellent false leads and misdirection that maintain suspense. There's also some graphic sex in this book, which may or may not be a bonus for some readers.<br /><br />The absence of Davenport's wife, Weather, is a plus, allowing this to be a less domestic story and more of a crime thriller. There is an ongoing theme of Davenport trying to fill his new Ipod with his choice of 100 best rock songs. It's cute, maybe a little too cute, but it mostly works as an underlying theme amidst all the violence. (Readers will find themselves debating his choices, along with many of the characters. It's fun and not as distracting as it sounds.)<br /><br />Many mysteries fall apart at the end, or are resolved too soon and then sputter until gasping to the last page. This book has no such problem, building and layering tension until the last pages, as the real killer and his methods keep both Davenport and the readers guessing. Add in political finger-pointing, the fine art of managing the media and various work-related injuries, and Davenport seems almost over his head.<br /><br />Davenport fans will enjoy this latest installment, as will new readers. It is a brutal story, with a lot of discomforting details that really add to the feeling of urgency. Overall, it's a compelling book that advances the Prey series in a completely satisfying and exhausting manner.olitical finger-pointing, the fine art of managing the media and various work-related injuries, and Davenport seems almost over his head. <br /> <br />Davenport fans will enjoy this latest installment, as will new readers.

Using his circle of friends and all their pooled talents, Kyle figures how to infiltrate the world of high-stakes publishing.<br /><br />Kyle and his friends are some of the most likeable juvenile characters in fiction. Kyle himself channels a bit of Ferris Bueller -- only much less selfish -- as he navigates New York. His sidekick, Lucinda, has a dash of Harriet the Spy-gone modern as she trails editors, cases office buildings and helps Kyle lay out their multi-step plan. Breaking into Kyle's dad's safe for a manuscript copy is one problem, but getting it into the hands of the hottest editor in the city is another thing entirely.<br /><br />New York is filled with interesting people, and Kyle's life is filled with characters who all figure in his plans. The grandmotherly cleaning lady, the dogwalking client with the double life, the perceptive bookshop owner, all pop in and out of the book in delightfully overlapping ways.<br /><br />Robyn Freedman Spizman and Mark Johnston use an interesting narrator in this book, one that can jump around and look into the future and into various characters' minds all at the same time. This takes a bit of getting used to but ultimately is very satisfying. For example, it's great to know that the young editor who innocently assists Kyle in an office break-in has a boyfriend who will find a vaccine for the West Nile virus, one day in the future. It's great the way the writers play with the future, with characters' inner-thoughts, and yet keep the story going in a fairly straightforward way.<br /><br />So many books fail in their endings. This book manages an honest, fulfilling conclusion. Kyle's wishes may or may not come true, but he has gained big victories. The conversation he has with his father in the last chapter makes it worth reading the entire book. It defines what parents and children want from each other, without being corny or obvious.<br /><br />A surprise hit, but a book that kids and parents won't want to miss.it worth reading the entire book.

It sounds like a lot, and it could easily become muddled and confusing, but Kellerman as always writes with such style and clarity that it's a gripping and fast-paced read.<br /><br />The story centers on the kidnapping and killing of baby Kristal. Delaware evaluates the two young suspects for the court, and years later the teen that survived incarceration calls him for a meeting. When he never shows and later turns up shot to death, Delaware and Sturgis begin to piece together a complicated case with tragic and surprising victims.<br /><br />Kellerman is a careful writer who uses wonderful details to convey bigger ideas and emotions. Food, for example, is used not to convey a sense of comfort or luxury or even a basic to human health. No, in Rage, food is something that sits heavy in the stomach, that is greasy and prepared by people with blood on their hands. Coffee tastes like metal, people slurp and leave greasy chins. It's an effective way to convey mood, by making something so pleasurable so unappealing.<br /><br />The book isn't perfect. My edition had a typo; there is a plot point that relies too heavily on an unbelievable coincidence; and Delaware's love interest is just plain self-righteous and annoying.<br /><br />But in the end, Kellerman delivers a fine mystery with reliably quirky and interesting characters. Fans will enjoy this book, and new readers will find themselves drawn into his fascinating psychological world of crime in L.A.	2005-07-12

As a former sensitive little girl, I love books about sensitive little girls. But to me, Ida B was a muddle of other fictional children, derived from the best but sadly lacking anything profoundly original.<br /><br />The story tells of a child who lives and homeschools with her loving parents on their farm. She spends her days talking to trees in the orchard, playing in the brook, and being very passionate about the details of her life. Her parents indulge her by not making her go to a public school when she decided after two weeks that she didn't like kindergarten. When her mother begins cancer treatments, Ida B must return to school. Then some of the beloved farm is sold off to pay for medical costs, resulting in the clearing of trees to make room for new houses.<br /><br />Ida B handles this by closing her heart to everyone until eventually a kind teacher shows her how to reach out to others and find happiness.<br /><br />Many readers clearly love Ida B, but I thought she seemed a bit inflexible and self-absorbed. This book seemed to channel girls in juvenile fiction from Junie B Jones to Harriet the Spy to numerous Sharon Creech characters, all of whom seem to this reviewer to be a lot more honest and true.<br /><br />By the time Ida B figured out that she was being mean and that she needed to open up her heart to her ill mother and her kind classmates, I had very little interest in her. Maybe she can hear trees talk and has some interesting notions. But this book seems to force the reader to like a main character who is quirky but mostly full of herself.	2005-07-03

It may be Scottoline's formula, but, hey, why argue with success?<br /><br />In Devil's Corner, Scottoline introduces Vicki Allegretti , an assistant U.S. attorney who has her partner shot to death in a meeting gone horribly wrong. The partner lies bleeding to death in Allegretti's arms, while in the same building, their contact is also lying dead in a pool of blood.<br /><br />Allegretti of course winds up investigating this case on her own time, against orders, and even teams up with another woman who is a total amateur. The plot winds through neighborhoods rotted by crack dealers, federal office buildings and jail as Allegretti follows her hunch that there is more to her partner's murder than a random killing.<br /><br />The book is exciting, and Allegretti is a fun character. Devoted Scottoline readers may miss the appearance of Mary and Benny, but Allegretti is a lively, passionate, funny and flawed heroine. As she and former inmate Reheema work together to solve the mysteries of all the violence, a deep friendship develops. And Allegretti has an off-limits love interest, as well, which helps to define and reveal her character's growth over the course of the book.<br /><br />Scottoline is a former trial lawyer who came up with the idea for this book from watching a drug trial for fun. She is an ace at legal thrillers, a writer who can tell a story without getting blogged down by legal minutiae and who knows how to make her lawyer characters downright likable.<br /><br />This is a must-read for fans of Scottoline's work, as well as for readers looking for a simple read with few demands other than enjoyment.	2005-06-30

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions	Books	2	4	4	N	N	Interesting story, great characters; pity about the writing	This story tells about the rise and fall of super-smart-MIT boys and their forays into card counting. From nerdy campus watering holes to plush Vegas VIP rooms, Bringing Down the House is a modern-day morality tale.<br /><br />The main character, Kevin, is a smart college kid who is seduced into an expert and tightly run card-counting operation comprised mainly of his fellow MIT students. Using a relatively simple scheme of tracking low and high cards, a counter who is placing minimal bets can signal a high-stakes player over to a table just as it's heating up. Over the course of a few years, these kids made millions up and down the Vegas Strip. Using costumes, fake ids, elaborate accents and well-developed characters, Kevin and his friends not only made mega bucks, but they also had access to the high-roller lifestyle, with the free suites, drinks, dinners and gorgeous women.<br /><br />Eventually, however, the casinos figured out their game, and a cat-and-mouse game followed. Mean casino managers, tough security thugs would chase them from their rooms, out of casinos and eventually, at least for Kevin, back to the straight and narrow.<br /><br />The book is fast-paced and straightforward, but at times Ben Mezrich's writing feels a bit stilted, and some of the dialog doesn't ring true. And the ending, while it ties up a lot of loose ends, is strangely unsatisfying. Apparently, there are few repercussions even after all the drama.<br /><br />In spite of any criticisms, however, the book is a fun read, particularly if you like blackjack or perhaps are on your way to Vegas. It certainly will make you wonder who's watching you.	2005-06-14

When she exchanges one man for another, she learns how very far she'd actually climbed, and how very far she will fall. She finds herself missing her snobbish world, the one where she never felt entirely welcome or comfortable.<br /><br />The English upper classes are interesting fodder for an American reader, and Julian Fellowes uses keen details and examples to explain the serious differences between Edith and her in-laws. Do not, for example, drop names or mention social events that you think are important, because this will reveal you as a outside the loop and a bore. Do not overstay your welcome at a cocktail party, because you may be holding up the dinner to which you were not invited. That it may be OK to marry for status or money rather than love, but one must stick to it. For life.<br /><br />Edith is not a usual heroine; she is often shallow, even cringe-worthy. Yet she possesses great awareness of herself, her life, her choices, and by the end of the book, her determination is a delight.<br /><br />Other characters are finely drawn and deeply sympathetic. Her husband, Charles, is a bore and not very smart. \\"I was struck again,\\" the narrator states, \\"by the common error, into which I have often fallen, certainly with Charles, of assuming that stupid people are spared deep feeling. Not that Charles was exactly stupid. He was simply incapable of original thought. But I knew now that he was more than capable of great love.\\"<br /><br />His mother, Lady Uckfield, is another dead-on character, with her layers of mannerisms and meanings.<br /><br />The book wraps itself up neatly and satisfyingly, if not with a lot of surprise and gusto. It's a smooth and fun novel, and in the end, the reader is treated to the life lesson that you should be careful what you wish for.of great love.\\" <br /> <br />His mother, Lady Uckfield, is another dead-on character, with her layers of mannerisms and meanings. <br /> <br />The book wraps itself up neatly and satisfyingly, if not with a lot of surprise and gusto.

In Ball Four, Bouton goes from the minors to the Seattle Pilots, then to Houston, over the course of the 1969 season. The book really captures a bygone era of baseball. Salaries were low, bus rides were long, and a lot of big names were still in the game.<br /><br />The book has a reputation for being funny, and it is. Bouton has a wry sense of humor and a keen eye for human foibles.<br /><br />A few subjects felt burned, but in this day of athletes accused of drug abuse and criminal behavior, some of the antics that Bouton writes about seem very tame, almost quaint. It's a little hard to see what the fuss was about if you're planted firmly in 2005.<br /><br />Bouton's observations are fascinating, capturing an era in baseball (and more broadly, in our nation) that has all but disappeared. These were the days before million-dollar contracts and when the length of their hair and sideburns sometimes held the key to a player's future.<br /><br />Bouton brings the moments alive, so the reader can feel the nerves of a pitcher blowing a game, the joy of running across a big-league field, the frustration of trying to get Gatorade, the speechlessness of finding one's shoes nailed to the clubhouse floor.<br /><br />Readers should be grateful that someone with a clear, ironic eye had the foresight to take notes and write this book. As Bouton himself says, so many of the funny details would have been lost forever.<br /><br />For baseball fans, young and old, put this at the top of your summer reading list.	2005-05-29

This is the kind of beginning that makes it hard to put down a book, and the story just keeps getting better.<br /><br />The book tracks Joey's survival and revenge on her murderous and perfectly stupid husband Chaz. And as readers come to expect with Carl Hiaasen's work, there are plenty of quirky characters whose paths criss-cross as the plot unfolds.<br /><br />Chaz is a deliciously stupid and scummy villain, and it's extremely satisfying to watch him pay for his deeds, which include covering up pollution damaging the Everglades. His bodyguard, Tool, is pure Hiaasen as he steals roadside crosses from death sites to plant in his garden, steals drugs from patients at senior living facilities, and at the end becomes a hero of sorts.<br /><br />Joey would be boring if she went straight to the police to report her miserable spouse. Instead, she teams up with Mick Stranahan on his private island and plots a revenge that drives her husband over the edge.<br /><br />Hiaasen takes a certain amount of patience. The reader needs to be willing to accept these extreme characters and the coincidences that draw them all together. But the book is so funny, so wonderfully written, that it's a pleasure to let yourself be sucked into the craziness.	2005-05-18

But when the diva star of the play is a no-show, Eve and Silvio go to check on her as a favor to the director, who is Silvio's old friend.<br /><br />By the end of the first chapter, it's clear that Eve isn't going to see the show. But the good news is that Eve, a seasoned LA Times reporter, has a big jump on her competition in what promises to be a huge breaking story.<br /><br />Savage Garden is Hamilton's best-written of the four-book Eve Diamond series. It is filled with underlying themes of trust and honesty that support the plot and add depth and a certain edgy mood to the story. Are reporters making up quotes and fabricating sources? Are they stealing each other's ideas? Is Silvio being honest with Eve about his own relationship with the missing actress?<br /><br />As usual, Hamilton nails the dynamics of an urban newsroom, with its hierarchies and posturing. Eve doesn't like having a new hot-shot reporter sitting at her desk, using her phone and listening in on her conversations. But she herself is not above stealing a story by pretending she couldn't stop her colleague in time to do it himself. Readers of previous Diamond mysteries are aware of  Eve's insecurities and jealousies and ambition, and this book takes all these traits up a notch.<br /><br />Hamilton uses the city of Los Angeles as a perfect setting for her vibrant story lines. She sets scenes in fantastic ethnic restaurants, poverty-filled neighborhoods, dense forests, rugged oceanside cliffs. The action pops off the pages, and the writing shows great style.<br /><br />Savage Garden is a terrific mystery, a must-read with a strong woman lead character and a lot of suspense.	2005-05-12

The voice is childlike but amazingly profound as the poems cover a squeaky school piano, a Southern cousin whose every word \\"just kind off slides out of his mouth\\" and the complete abandon one feels when dancing deep in the music of Earth, Wind and Fire.<br /><br />My favorite two poems are a bit more serious. In \\"Keepsake,\\" Greenfield uses just nine simple  lines to convey loss, and the impact adults can have on children. This is not a maudlin poem that is too heavy or upsetting. Although it deals with death, it's respectful and loving. And the poem \\"Harriet Tubman\\" is amazing, deftly describing the woman's heroics and bravery in a satisfying and strong verse.<br /><br />Honey, I Love is a thought-provoking work that stands the test of time. It's a book that adults and children can, and should, enjoy together.	2005-05-11

Does anyone think a child will listen to this story and be injected with self-esteem? That kids really think it's OK to be a slow runner and be chosen last? That kids are all really well-adjusted and nice, making it easy to be yourself day in and day out? It's nice fiction, but it doesn't ring true to any child past the age of 4.<br /><br />Another problem I have is that half the pages are written in a cursive script. My son is 7 and a really good reader, and yet he needed help with some of the book's text.<br /><br />If you're looking for something positive to read to a child who is not yet reading on his or her own, this might very well work for you. I can imagine cuddling a preschooler, who would enjoy the rhythm of the words and the colors on the pages.<br /><br />Older children may just look at you with a skeptical expression.	2005-05-11

This is a fantastic, handy cookbook, perfect for a home cook who is trying to break out of a recipe rut. It also would make a great gift for someone graduating college and getting a first apartment, or for someone who is single and maybe getting weary of constant carry-out. The recipes are simple, with basic ingredients, and mostly prepare two servings (although many can be doubled).<br /><br />The book is all main courses and loosely organized by main ingredient: fish, poultry, meat, meatless, etc. The layout is fantastic, with gorgeous photographs and blurbs with suggested side dishes, wines and desserts. Also, it opens and stays open to your work page, which makes it easy to refer to during cooking. The recipes are interesting, ranging from comfort food like chicken and dumplings to elegant meals to ethnic dishes, and all the ones I've tried have had successful results.<br /><br />If you're a gourmet cook with unlimited ideas for family meals, then this will not be for you. But if you're a beginner, or someone who likes to prepare fresh meals but sometimes lacks inspiration or time to think about menus, this cookbook will be a welcome addition to your kitchen bookshelf.	2005-05-09

But Aaronson is not a professional actress; rather, she's an Orthodox Jew who is selected in order to lend the television show a little authenticity.<br /><br />Hava is a fun and interesting character. She's very religious and traditional, but she's also a punk-rock fan and has a lot of personal attitude and style. She may keep kosher, speak Yiddish, wear long skirts and not touch boys. But she curses like crazy, sneaks into clubs, drinks alcohol and talks back to authority figures. And with a self-done haircut, a long black skirt covered by a green kilt and a short mini, her Orthodox look is anything but.<br /><br />The book does a good job of showing a glimpse of Orthodox Jews and their community, rituals and ideas. It's easy to categorize and label religious people, even teen-agers, and define them by religion alone. Hava won't let the reader or anyone else do that to her. It's interesting to see her struggle with her faith, her relationship to God, her lifestyle, her career. It's also refreshing to see religious youths who not only pray, but act, make movies, rap, party, dance.<br /><br />This is a coming-of-age story with a lot of gimmicks. It would be interesting enough to read about a punky Orthodox girl and her viewpoints and thoughts on boys and friends and parents and school and pop culture. Throwing in the Hollywood elements almost seems over-the-top. But if you go along for the ride, it's a fun trip.	2005-05-09

Bertie wanders through his LA life with his childhood friend Clea, actor/ daughter of a Hollywood iconic star; and her older boyfriend Thad, a writer/actor also second-generation to fame and fortune. The group barely functions as they careen off Southern California landmarks, dropping names and going to the gym and hanging at the Chateau Marmont and AA meetings.<br /><br />At first, I thought the book was badly written and a little too Hollywood insider for me. There's Nick Nolte at Book Soup! Here's an anecdote about Brandon Tartikoff's funeral! I felt a bit stupid, like it was a book written for someone far hipper and cooler than I am. I was sure I wasn't getting the jokes because I'm outside that world. And besides, I wasn't sure I liked the characters, all trying to develop HBO series and make money and get recognition. The characters all have deep sadness in their lives. They're complicated people but a day at California Adventure gets as much attention in this  book as a father's funeral.<br /><br />Yet, within a few chapters, I was enthralled. These characters are so vain, so delusional, trying so hard to stay on top of the pop-culture wave du jour, that I couldn't help feeling amused at their lives and conversations. They weren't smarter than I. I finally got the joke.<br /><br />This book is hilarious, a little sad, but definitely captivating. At the end, Bruce Wagner had me exactly where I believe he wants his readers. It's an amazing and deft work that makes a stark commentary on pop culture, fame and relationships.	2005-05-02

However, not one of the characters seemed someone I would identify with or care too much about. They all seemed to be controlled and as cold as their northern settings. I understand why readers would admire Munro's writing style and even enjoy these stories, which are all very carefully written with a certain wry fatalistic viewpoint. Munro's truly skilled and talented, but I like to feel a bit more for the characters I read about. I can't tell if the stories didn't live up to the hype, or if they just weren't for me. Because certainly there isn't a lot to criticize with Munro's prose. She's an astute observer and wonderful writer; these particular stories just didn't grab me as I hoped they would.	2005-04-29

He really just wants to nurse a sick reindeer and get some sleep. Except, to his chagrin, he notices a lump in his sack and realizes he forgot to deliver a package. And this package, unfortunately, will be missed. It's for Harvey Slumfenburger, and it represents the sole Christmas booty that the young boy will get. You just know how much Santa wants to go back out to deliver this gift, but he does so without complaint.<br /><br />Of course, the reindeer are tired and sick, so Santa has to find creative and sundry ways to the top of Roly Poly Mountain, where Harvey lives. He gets the present to Harvey and finds his way back, although it's a long and tiring journey.<br /><br />My children love this story. The idea that Santa would go to such lengths is really appealing, and they adore trying to guess what Harvey's gift is. (The author smartly leaves us wondering). The story is about love, and any parent who has tried to obtain a hard-to-find toy or move mountains to get from work to the school play would completely relate.<br /><br />Don't be put off by the monotonous aspect of Santa's trip, or the unfortunate tongue-tying name of the young boy.

She is a fascinating lead character, all at once competent and intuitive and smart. Rimington does a superb job at pacing the plot. It ebbs and flows as one imagines a real investigation would, picking up speed and hitting dead ends and just-missing and meandering. The result is a suspenseful story that feels very real and believable.<br /><br />This book reminded me of the recent Nelson DeMille novel Night Fall, using real events from the news in a fictionalized way. It's a device that works for me, especially when paired with an extremely likable main character. Rimington also presents the reader with a fully formed and complicated villain in young Lucy, an Englishwoman-turned-jihad-warrior. Rimington creates an intelligent villain who is tinged with self-doubt and ambivalence. I really like the way the two women seem to close their eyes and sense the others' presence.<br /><br />The men in the book aren't useless, although Liz clearly puts up with a lot in order to get the job done. It's a nice piece of detective fiction, one that shows women in smart and strong roles and that clearly draws on the author's personal and extensive experience.	2005-04-29

When we reached the section of this book where the planes hit the buildings, he turned to me and said, \\"So THAT'S what happened.\\" He was relieved to have the upsetting topic finally explained. Even years later, he has trouble understanding the heroes who died; many of the nuances and realities of that time simply elude him. Fireboat helped me broach the subject in a way that he seemed OK with.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I'm surprised at those who felt blindsided mid-read to their children. I can't understand not taking a second to flip through a book before reading any book to a child. To blame the book for a parental oversight seems very unfair. And also, avoiding the 9-11 topic with small children seems like whistling past the graveyard. Better to read a book like this, with some historical perspective and optimism, then to have a child like mine who felt in the dark and frightened of the unknown.<br /><br />This is a cheery, well-written book about a terrible topic. The author walks a fine line between being too glib and too severe, but in the end, it's a successful effort.	2005-04-27

She's too little and careless and messy to have a nice room like her big sister Sarah. In fact, she's banned from the room by a lock because she made such a mess out of it. But in a dream, Jen realizes she's grown enough to reach the lock. Later, while awake, she can in fact get inside and plays nicely. When she's discovered, she's praised and she too ends up with a beautiful bedroom of her own.<br /><br />Maybe it's being a little sister, or perhaps it's Sendak's fantastic artwork or Doris Orgel's sweet rhymes, but this book always intrigued me as a little girl. I identified with Jen and was so happy for her for growing up. I also liked the idea of having a room in such beautiful, Sarah-like shape. Dollhouses all perfectly set up, glass animals on shelves, toys all in their place, wallpaper in pristine condition. I was always a slob and had to share a room, so this was a fantastic fantasy for me.<br /><br />Children, especially girls, will love this simple and timeless story of sisters and growing up. It's a nice tiny edition that is a lovely gift for a child with a library or book collection. I had searched for it for years and am delighted to have it for my daughter.	2005-04-26

First of all, it's amazingly smooth and accessible, without the stain of pulp fiction or trash. This is not a throwaway book or a summer, pool side guilty pleasure. It's a dense, thought-provoking work.<br /><br />The story is told from the perspective of Lee Fiora, who is narrating this coming-of-age book with remarkable clarity and honesty from her safe perch in adulthood. It  begins with Lee as a 14-year-old Indiana girl who has gone behind her back to get accepted with financial aid into a Massachusetts boarding school. Her parents reluctantly drop her off, and her life will never be the same.<br /><br />This is a painful and awkward tale, and Lee is an astute observer if an unremarkable member of the student body. At Ault School, students fit in if they are wealthy and beautiful. Lee is neither, and she spends her time at school as an outsider.<br /><br />Outsiders, however, make the best narrators because they really see the intricacies of the others around them. Lee describes the popular girl, Aspeth, and her roommate's intense obsession with her. She witnesses the dynamics between the popular and rich boys, the rich Mexican girls versus the scholarship Mexican girls, the sexuality of her peers, the confidence that some students exude and others seek to find.<br /><br />Lee herself is awkward. Since starting boarding school, she seems to be unable to cope with her classwork. She has trouble making friends. She is so matter-of-fact that she is exasperating to everyone: her teachers, her roommates, her parents.<br /><br />The book covers her four years at school and has a fairly linear plot line that works well, because Lee is such a fascinating character with such honest and specific memories. The only aspect of the story that failed for me was reaction to a New York Times interview that Lee gave her senior year. This exact story line made up a very compelling episode of Beverly Hills, 90210, and it seemed derivative and beneath the author to repeat it here.<br /><br />I read this book quickly, and it often gave me that painful feeling you get when seeing someone embarrass themselves on TV or on stage. I identified so strongly with Lee when she was making her mistakes, and this is truly a book of an adolescent's mistakes.<br /><br />The nostalgia of this novel had an interesting additional twist for me. When I was the age of Lee in this book, I just adored books with prep school characters. A Separate Peace, Catcher in the Rye, some other girls' book where the main character obsessed about Katherine Hepburn. This book felt like stepping into a time warp for me on multiple levels.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who is willing to face their own awkward youth, who likes a great and easy read, and who is interested in social themes like adolescent sexuality, class privilege and the development and breakdown of relationships.author to repeat it here. <br /> <br />I read this book quickly, and it often gave me that painful feeling you get when seeing someone embarrass themselves on TV or on stage.

Smithson Ide is an overweight, lonely man who numbs himself with cigarettes and booze and food. As the book opens, he loses both parents in a car crash, and on the day of their funeral, he learns his long-missing and insane sister is dead, her body waiting for him in a Venice, CA mortuary. His world forever changed, Smithy ends up traveling from Rhode Island on his childhood bicycle to claim his sister's body.<br /><br />This is a difficult trip physically and emotionally, and as he travels, he realizes the extent of his family's helplessness and the elusiveness of happiness. His pain draws strangers to him, many with horrifying histories that work like a salve on him. He's a good listener, and his haplessness and sometimes too-coincidental timing let him be in the right place to save a life, nurse the sick and offer  hope.  As he makes his long trek on his bike, he loses huge amounts of weight while gaining clarity. He comes to terms with his past and eventually realizes that suffering is not exclusive to the Ide family.<br /><br />\\"The Memory of Running\\" is a dense book, full of humanity and humor and honesty.

The story begins in the fall, with Spenser  at the hospital bedside of his longtime friend Hawk. Hawk has been shot three times in the back during a bodyguard assignment. Of course, when Hawk recovers, he wants revenge, and Spenser is obliged to assist. Hawk's shooters turn out to be Ukranians who are working in a corrupt town outside Boston, and in a complicated organized crime circle, many old and new players are intertwined.<br /><br />Hawk and Spenser emerge from this book as soul mates, so connected and close that both men seem to be surprised by the revelation. Their big difference is race, and they compensate by jokes and dry pejorative remarks. At times, some of this dialog seemed obnoxious and racist. But mostly it works, because these two men are connecting like they never have before, resorting to humor to get through the dicy times.<br /><br />In spite of being emotionally charged, this is not a touchy-feely book. Parker manages to use his long fictional history of their stories, along with a new and twisty plot, to delve into a different kind of story. Issues of loyalty, personality, trust and expectations are the real meat of the book. For anyone who is a Spenser fan, this is certainly not a book to be missed. For a new reader, it's a great introduction to Parker's work.	2005-04-24

I'd suggest it for airplanes or poolside holidays. Few redeeming elements, I'm sorry to say. It was well-written and light, but also very very obvious and silly. The kind of book where a running joke is women trying to guess how big a guy's thing is. Of course, the girl gets the guy and his thing is huge. Now isn't that the sweetest ending ever?	2005-04-19

But it was a slow read and ultimately not worth the time I put into it.<br /><br />The story is about a Washington D.C. dealmaker/lobbyist/lawyer, the broker of the title. Grisham seemed to pushing the broker nickname pretty hard in order to justify a book title that kind of matched other books of his, like The Rainmaker or The Partner. Here, every time the character is called The Broker it seems forced, like it's stuck in there to justify the title.<br /><br />The Broker begins the book in prison after pleading guilty when a complicated software-spy-international deal blows up. Years later, sick and 60 pounds lighter, he's pardoned, whisked to Italy and given a new identity. Why? Because the CIA wants to leak his whereabouts to his enemies, of which there are many, to see who tries to kill him, so they can nab the killers. He's in Italy, and he's bait.<br /><br />The book is well-enough written, and just interesting enough to want to read through. However, it suffers from a way-too linear plot that more or less follows every footstep the Broker takes. Now he's having breakfast pastries! Now he's having a long lunch! Now he's learning Italian! Now it's time for dinner!<br /><br />There are several characters who are so undeveloped that it's obvious they were written in as plot devices only. A president so dumb he doesn't read anything at all? A son who apparently exists only to get his dad a cellphone and explain email? A dying husband in a rear bedroom who happens to have an available passport? Pull-ease. I kept thinking this last example would be a trap, but the plot was far too simple for anything like that. I was running rings around this book logically, and it was tiring.<br /><br />The book is interesting on a high level. Government corruption is always a fun thing to read about, and the descriptions of historical Bologna and Italian style all very nice. But it was a book written by someone resting on his laurels.ting on his laurels.	2005-04-17
