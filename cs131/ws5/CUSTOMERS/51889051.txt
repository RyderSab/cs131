Why is the review submission link way down at the bottom for this book? Anyway, Cole has a mentality that's pre Hiroshima-Nagasaki. He interprets current geo-politics as if it were still 1941. Unlike the Japanese navy/air force which was an entirely indigenous affair with planes made by Mitsubishi and ships designed by Japanese engineers the Chinese military is based on Soviet plans. During the Sino_Japanese war Japan gained an easy victory over China for among other reasons China's inability to build a national military industry, using Russian made fighter planes, Russian firearms etc. And that's still the case only now they're using decrepit Soviet made submarines armed with nuclear warheads. A fact Cole seems utterly oblivious of. And a fact that renders his Von Clauswitz grand strategist posing ridiculous.	2002-09-06

Salon.com bills itself as a kink for upwardly mobile yuppies on their consumer profiles, hopefully luring advertisers with the scent of such rotten meat, their gossip columns staffed by NPR (Archer Daniels Midland, Voice of America) poetasters and speech writers for Bob Dole. The New York Times encourages the sleazy globalist imperatives of Thomas Friedman's Corporate Zionism. So the critical reception is revealing, and this book is harmless pabulum for self-conscious suburban liberals who think it's hip to be anti-Disney. None of these American clowns are concerned with the extinction of cultural diversity and the hegemonic one world mono-culture their own country is largely responsible for.

But Zipes is guilty of the same mamby pamby moralism that he criticizes in others, if you've read his Oxford Book of Fairy Tales you'll find that it's an unimaginative collection of innocuous speech codes and flaky feminist paranoia which is tedious and boring. Much of the \\"homogeneity\\" he complains about  in popular culture comes from the dictates of \\"least objectionable programming\\" which advertisers like and is not unlike the political correctness found in elite Western institutions, where Zipes hails from obviously. J.K. Rowlings caricatures are embarrassingly \\"diverse\\" as if from a from a sensitivity training pogram which good leftists like Zipes should respect after all. Zipes reiterates all the liberal platitudes which have become suburban marketing clichs. Although he doesn't exactly advocate body piercing or tattoos. Not yet anyway. In short it's difficult to see where Zipes complaints lie since corporate progressives are pretty much dictating his own taste.	2002-08-08
