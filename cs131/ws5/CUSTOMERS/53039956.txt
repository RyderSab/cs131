As the other reviewers note part of this book is about terrorism.  The other reviews also do a nice job of covering plot so I will skip it. <br /> <br />I would suggest the book is about so much more than terrorism. In fact I think his views of terrorism are not integral to the story and would not recommend reading it as a text in support of or against current US policy.  Rushdie condemns politicians and their inane behavior in many ways, but I do not view that as central. <br /> <br />First and foremost, I believe this book is about the meaning of freedom.  This brings it close to the heart of Rushdie who of course had to give up his freedom, at least for awhile to take advantage of his freedom to think and write. The book recounts the flights to freedom and differing views of it through many of the characters in the book. It explores the struggles of many characters to attain freedom or to benefit from it.   This includes Max Ophuls who fled the nazis, Boon-yi, the heroine of sorts, who is trapped in her life, India Ophuls, the daughter of Maxand other characters.  It is also about Kashmir and its loss of freedom at the hands of India and Pakistan who use it for their political ends. <br /> <br />I also believe this book is about the western concept of fate as passed down from the Greeks and its meanings. It is also about women and their role in societies and how they cope with men, life, love, tragedy and more.  Much of it reminded me of the classics by men and written about women. Yes this is a short list, but Rushdie does such an amazing job of dealing with these issues, I can hardly do it justice. <br /> <br />All this is done through a tight plot with typical Rushdie humor, twists and turns and a good share of mysticism. It was a pleasure to read and I heartily recommend it.	2005-09-27
US	53039956	RA5FNC1744IHP	0060778970	142631692	Zorro: A Novel	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Excellent read	I have long been a fan of Isabelle Allende's work and would especially commend House of Spirits and Eva Luna.  I find her ability to intermingle the mystical and the real into a novel enjoyable.  She has certainly outdone herself with Zorro.  I knew nothing about Zorro except childhood memories of the TV show so approached this book without pre-conceived notions of this Robin Hood of California (or Barcelona or New Orleans).   <br /> <br />Ms. Allende's approach, her narrator and the narrator's ability to retell the story from before birth were fascinating.  Each little adventure and the greater adventures read like the best of Dumas.  The building of his personality was like the best of well, Allende.  The side characters were wonderful and I cannot wait to discuss them with friends after they read the book.   <br /> <br />Overall, this book confronts issues of justice, rich and poor, human development and does so in an entertaining way.  I heartily recommend it.	2005-08-06

It is a page turner like Jurassic Park, Andromeda strain and his other novels.  The characters become real and interesting and the action begins with Page 1.  I found the first chapter a bit confusing as I tried to keep characters straight, but it did not take long to solve this problem. <br /> <br />I also find his science (as a non-scientist) valuable.  In recent years I have been perturbed as TV, media and other reviewers here started accepting theory and conjecture as real truth and asked the U.S. and world to devote trillions to something that may not be happening or a problem if it does happen.  Mr. Crichton does the same.  Just because people believe it is so does not make it so as Mr. Crichton points out quite well.  Global warming, of course is the it. I have also been amazed how every new event is called a global catastrophe that can be sourced to global warming.  Oh my god it snowed in Chicago, why it must have some link!  It was hot in LA.  There must be a link.  Mr. Crichton also exposes this thinking. <br /> <br />Finally he makes fun of the biggest espousers of false science, the media, the actors, the hollywood wannabes and the academics who want tenure so produce junk research.  Great job and good book. <br /> <br />For those who wrote reviews calling Crichton's science wrong, I suggest you read some of the source texts he footnotes and puts in his bibliography, especially Bjorn Lomberg who has statistically shown that the Global Warming alarmists are like the emperor with no clothes.   <br /> <br />	2005-01-01

THis book goes to a level where we almost know what Stalin had for dinner every night.  It spends much time on his relations with his family, friends and comrades.  I am sure this will enlighten some.<br />On the other hand this book is not recommended for non-Stalin scholars.  Important external details (like much of WW2) are omitted so it is hard to figure out exactly what is happening at times.  The onset of the Cold War is even less well explained, although some events, like the meetings with Churchill and FDR are explained in detail.<br />I would say the greatest plus of this book is its description of a tyrant going mad, eliminating every person around him who might be a threat and creating new threats out of an overwhelming imagination.  I would say the greatest flaw is the picture much of the book draws of Stalin as some sort of intellectual who likes to eat with friends and party with women.  WHile this is going on millions are dieing, but hte focus remains on the fete of the evening and not the atrocities.<br />Finally, while I understand Mr. Montefiore is Jewish, his focus on who is and is not jewish was quite off=putting.  If somebody did not tell me he was jewish I would have guessed he was leading to some sweeping anti-semitic conclusions. I was not sure through the whole book why I needed to know who was Jewish and who was not.  Maybe in England the word &quot;Jew&quot; is used as an adjective before a name like the Jew, Leon Trotsky, but it is not common in the U.S. and as I just said, it turned me off tremendously.	2004-05-01

It is billed as a history but it is not.  Yes it is probably factually correct, but its presentation is shall we say weird.  I think the author thinks he can write history with the flair and style of Churchill, something at which he fails.  There are no footnotes or backing for statements that need it and certainly some of his opinion comes across as nothing more than that.  For example I do not know if Richard the Linohearted of England and Philip of France were homosexual lovers but the presentation of this affair is not contextual and makes little sense.  There is less context for their sudden rivalry.  Finally, while Mr. Reston tries, he does not give particularly adequate background on the happenings in Europe.	2004-05-01

Mr. Hanson, despite some flaws does a good job of making the arguments.The book is also an interesting response to Jared Diamond's more deterministic thesis presented in Guns, Germs and Steel.<br />However, I think the battles chosen were chosen to specifically match the thesis and that a more thorough view of other battles may prove part of the thesis wrong. In other words I sometimes wonder if Mr. Hanson is stretching to prove a point.<br /> I also have some problems with Mr. Hanson's organization.  While he makes his points he also seems to bounce around within each section so that the section does not necessarily seem unified by chronology or theme. This also makes parts of the book seem repetitive.  This problem is exacerbated by Mr. Hanson's proclivity toward stating a fact multiple times.  <br />Still it is a good book and I found certain sections, like the one on Roarke's Drift especially fascinating.	2004-02-16

He again studies the character of the societies they came from and how this is reflected in the armies and in the way the leaders handled the battles.  I found the section on Patton especially interesting, especially his thesis that Eisenhower and BRadley (especially the latter) were at times incompetent. I am sure this is not old news, but the arguments made were quite convincing.  <br />Another argument that is interesting and not completely drawn out is that society had possibly changed around battle preventing Patton from executing his war plan to his best ability.  The idea Patton expounded of killing as many of the enemy as possible with as few American casualties as possible seems to have been somewhat politically incorrect.  The advent of better communications also meant the leader had less freedom of action.  It would be interesting to read more on this thesis.<br />Finally, one small flaw that bothers me, Mr. Hanson can get a bit repetitive.  For example he dwells on General Patton's lack of supplies so often and uses almost the same sentences all the time.  It is like he feels we forgot what he said a few pages before.	2004-02-16

Mr. Hopkirk takes a fascinating piece of history and makes it read like an adventure story.  His story about the many who tried to go to Lhasa and failed is fascinating. This book is not a book glorifying any given party but helps explain many players. He provides interesting details and insight into the would be explorers and the conditions that finally lead to the success of the quest. At the same time he provides valuable information on Tibet and its rulers and the British and Chinese and their motivations. His discussion of the Pundits is informative, interesting and sympathetic.  It is a short and fast read and well worth the time.	2003-10-11

It does a good job of explaining Louis XIV and many of his important relations such as those with his mother, Colbert and Mazarin.  The book however suffers from a dated style including such things as blaming an affair on black magic and an almost Shakespearean view of body function as a result of romantic ups and downs.  In addition titles such as Monsieur (the king's brother in the end) are inexplicably handed to a couple of people and can be confusing without proper explanation.  Finally this edition lacks important maps and a family tree of ancestors to Louis so it is never quite clear who Henry IV is or how different kings, princes, queens and dukes are related.  Still it is an enjoyable read an informative to somebody not versed in the life and times of Louis XIV.	2003-10-11

I'll explain.  FIrst the bold headers every five paragraphs or so are off putting, but allow her to change topics fast and make the book seem more stream of conscious.  <br />Also I agree with much of what she has to say and find her arguments plausible for the most part.  Her tactic is to use specific instances and build from there.  Sometimes, like with NOW and the Gay Alliances she builds to a unifying point.  Other times (TV and media) she builds to many examples but not further.  <br />The book is worht reading, but it is not Bill Bennett.	2003-04-29

I found it often repetitive with some facts stated over and over again, maybe in case I had not read the page before.

Hence I picked up this book and had my questions answered.  I'll leave the answers to the reader.  I found the book generally informative and well written.  I always have to fight my way through early life in a bio, but Davis' life was interesting and well described by Cooper.  The sections describing Davis public life before and during the war were well written and quite  interesting.  Cooper does a good job of explaining the southern mind in the 1850's.  I have a couple of quibbles with the book.  First Cooper can be quite repetitive giving the same fact or story over again, sometimes within 3 pages of the first statement.  Second there are some contradictions.  For example Cooper talks about what good friends Davis and Seward were til the end.  But then he tells about Seward's desire to jail, try and maybe hang Davis.  He mentions how bitter they were too.  How does he reconcile these facts?  Overall though, a good pick up for somebody curious about Jefferson Davis and the south, especially before the Civil War.	2002-04-08

It has the right amount of facts and is adequately noted at the end.  It does not have every detail, but more than enough in its 800 or so pages to satisfy most people's curiosity about Napolean, France and what went on.  Mr. Schom is very negative on Napolean, blaming him for many of the troubles France has experienced in the last 200 years and indeed blaming him for other historical issues (the break of the Hapsburg empire).  Unlike the NYT reviewer though I have never worshipped Napolean and did not feel he was worth even naming a street after prior to reading the book.  I always wondered what the French saw in a conquerer who killed off many of its people, hurt Europe and bankrupted many a country.  I do not think this book explains the French psyche (who can?) but it explains the rest of the story.	2002-02-14

He does a good job on the early years and the book is readable, but it later falls apart.  While certain revolutionary battles are well covered, many such as Yorktown are barely mentioned.  In addition, the all important winter at Valley Forge does not get much attention. <br />The book barely covers Washington's presidency, covering it in 70 of 500 pages written.  For such a monumental event, this is little time.  In addition, there are factual errors, for example Hamilton is described as the son of a British Admiral.  A few pages the correct parentage is given.  THis book is a good first read, but a better editor should have been assigned.	2001-02-19

Whether dealing with Charles and Adam, Lee, Kathy, Caleb and Aron or Samuel and the Hamiltons, the book raises so many questions worth pondering and discussing.  I would add this is one of the great book club books.  Anybody with a love of thought should read this.	2001-02-19

I have read Kennedy's speeches and have generally agreed with the author's theories. The book is also a fast read and reasonably well written/organized. <br />However there are a couple of problems with the book.  First,as was said, it needs a good editor.  There are a couple of repetitions which are not needed in a book of this length.  Second, how many times can one use the word Stimsonian in one sentence? 10 or 20?  Maybe the author should have developed a synonym for the word. Finally, often the author makes an argument without quoting from Kennedy.  Unsubstantiated arguments become just one guys opinion and not a great theory to work form.<br />Still, a good book and an interesting thesis.	1998-06-26

I consider the topic extremely important and do wish more people would read about it, however this book is flawed in many ways.  <br /> Much of this has to do with the length of the book.  I must question the reasoning for a 225 page book on such an important topic and one in which Ms. Chang must posess thousands of pages of material.  Didn't Harper Collins believe in her project? <br /> Due to this short length I also must question the organization.  The 30 page or so overview of events at the front seems too long for a 225 page book.  In addition the chapter order is a little too bouncy for the length. <br /> This length also leads to another problem, some of the topics are only superficially covered.  We learn about Herr Rabe in a few pages and the other International Zone Heroes get less time.  The entire zone gets what 30 pages?  Why not expand on the topic? <br /> In addition, Ms. Chang's writing style is good but not great.  Her sentences run short and those that are longer seem awkward.  There are also some sentences and at least a couple of entire paragraphs that make no sense at all. To add to this agony, the footnote scheme or lack of one is harmful. Again, I suggest she find a better editor next time. <br /> Finally,  after about 150 pages Ms. Chang leaves the tragic events of 1937 and looks at the cover ups.  Due to the short length of the book, her look at another important topic seems like a young woman flinging emotional arrows.  With length and a developed argument, her &quot;arrows&quot; would have a better point.  <br /> In sum,  I commend Ms. Chang for her efforts and for writing what is now a well read book on an important topic.  However, I strongly suggest that she  write a longer treatise on the topic, delving more deeply into her source material and find a better editor who cares more about her topic than about selling the book to short attention span buyers.  Also, let me point out that it took over 50 years to make Schnidler's List.  With some patience, I imagine somebody will make a movie out of her story also.	1998-03-09

After reading the book, or as much of it as I could before I decided to try a different book on the topic, I am wondering about the reviewers.    This book lacks the heart and soul of a good biography.  It gives a lot of minute details about aspects of his life without ever tieing them together into a bigger picture.  While the book talks about Gladstone's religion and refers at times to his own repressed sexuality, the book never provides a theory on why  he starts spending so much time reforming prostitutes.  Repeatedly, Jenkins refers to his walks and tells a little about the woman, but the psychology of Gladstone is not better understood due to his writing.    More important, Jenkins never provides enough context to understand where a bill or action is coming from.  I mean this on both a personal and macro level.  So Gladstone wanted justice for Ireland.  Why?  Also, what was the big picture that made this such an important part of 19th Century British Poltiics?    One final criticism, Jenkins may have delved into Gladstone, but he fails to draw clear images of the surrounding cast.  A good biography should provide knowledge of the time, but I learned little about Peel, Palmerston, Disraeli, Victoria or Albert.  I learned less about the great diplomatic and political issues of the time.    For these reasons, my rating of a three might be generous.  For a better understanding of this man and his time, I strongly suggest books on Disraeli, which, like their main character,  are written with more flair and pinache.  Also books on Victorians by Gertrude Himmelfarb and Asa Briggs provide more knowledge than Roy Jenkins' book.    One final thought,  are the good reviews this book has received due to the political popularity of Jenkins, the dearth of good books on Gladstone, or to use Moynihan'stheme, the defining down of historical writing in recent times?	1997-06-09

I sincerely hope that after reading many of his books, I do not make the mistakes that Mr. Gould points to.  His explanation of how evolution does work, was both interesting and readily understandable. I highly recommend this book to other readers	1997-06-09
