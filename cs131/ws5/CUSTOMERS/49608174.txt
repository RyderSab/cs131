Rendell realistically depicts the indignities and cruelties facing elderly women who are alone - the more frail rely on loyal friends, alone themselves, who give unstintingly. One of these older ladies remarks to herself when she receives an invitation to a party that she was rather honored to be invited, as she was \\"a woman of no particular importance.\\" That a decent, kindly older woman actually sees herself so pitilessly displays the author's gimlet eye for social relationships and ruthless hierarchies.  How essential it is to be \\"someone\\", a person of particular importance, if you are to be an older woman. Otherwise you will be ignored and left to die alone, seems to be Rendell's tragic message. Rendell forces the reader to face uncomfortable truths, particularly in the shocker ending (don't look at the last page!), when her elderly anti-heroine is spared one final cruelty of old age. Rendell writes about moral issues, about right and wrong, cruelty and kindness, and as such, her novels are so much more than entertainment.	2005-10-06

Since approximately 50% of the reading public is writing a novel, and 98% of the population spends too much money, you may recognize yourself. Many readers will instinctively cringe at Schwarz's mercilessly photographic rendering of Margaret and Letty, ever-hopeful novelist and overachieving spendthrift, respectively. I can vouch that this novel will linger in your conscience long after you finish it. Perhaps you are not as wildly grandiose as Margaret or as financially haphazard as Letty. Perhaps you are as self effacing and realistic as I am, since I relished every moment of this book. And the after-effects have been lasting. I have only a few minor grandiose fantasies left.	2005-08-08

The best material here is on the causes of crime and the effect of parents on children. The least effective is the lists of names and their socioeconomic impact.  Dubner translates Levitt's work wonderfully well; however, the book is not much more than the Times Magazine article expanded and padded.  It's best moments are when Levitt and Dubner demonstrate the practical power of creative economic thinking about social problems.  Do borrow Freakonomics from the library, at the very least!	2005-08-03

Except that I hope you will read this book if you haven't already and that you will share it with any young people you know. Mona Golabek has written a sincere, heartfelt memoir of her mother during World War II, enriched by both musical and family values. Ms. Golabek's memoir clearly shows how great music has the ability to sustain and nourish the soul in desperate circumstances. The spirit of Willesden Lane, of the young people who survived the war, and of their parents who sacrificed all, live on in this poignant, beautifully told story.	2005-07-18

An ambitious bourgeoise marries an English Earl for the title and stately home, then trades in her stuffy aristocratic husband for an exciting but decidedly common actor. In the wrong hands, this rather familiar story could have been a deadly beach read sort of thing. Luckily, we are in the hands of a master manipulator, one Julian Fellowes, who if he was not accepted in all the right snooty drawing rooms before, will surely find his name deleted from the Duchess's guest list henceforth. If you have ever yearned to marry up, the secrets of the striving parvenu are contained herein. If you have ever sought to be admitted to a stately English home without paying for a ticket, this book is your resource. If you are ridiculously content with your piddling middle class life and haven't the slightest interest in your daughter marrying into the gentry - you'd do well to read this book anyway. After a long, satisfying weekend in the country hunting with the aristocracy and their baying dogs, you will be more than happy to knit by the fire in your cozy suburb a safe distance from Broughton, while Mr. Fellowes explains it all to you. He is a worthy successor to Wilde.	2005-06-07

He is a real talent. I was frequently overcome with laughter as I read. What is truly inspired is the way Albo nails the trends of the past 15 years. The yoga theme is a hoot, with its Hinduisms spouted by the pretentious narrator. Another blast is the conceit of Disorder, for which the cure-all is Askalar. The tones of know-it-all worldliness with which these ideas and cures are touted add to the fun. Each chapter ends with a drawing succinctly encapsulating the preceding episode, and each is a fabulous, witty entry. I don't have words to describe the fun of this book. But are people really so begrudging of others' success? Mike Albo's social circle must be green with envy at his triumph.	2005-05-31

In this luminous novel, a group of human clones are trapped in a society devoid of moral conscience. Rather than further reveal the premise of the book, I will only say that the author slowly, subtly unfolds what is in store for the protagonists. Given a story that might be horrific, Ishiguro achieves the seemingly impossible of combining that Poe-like premise with a sunlit atmosphere of childhood innocence, youthful growth of understanding, and finally, an adult quest. I wonder if this novel will not take its place beside Brave New World and 1984 as a vision of a totalitarian future. And yet, it is set in the 1990's. As if Western society has already crossed the line into a moral wilderness. What a powerful indictment, in an artistic yet accessible story. \\"Never Let Me Go\\" deserves to be a classic. It is one of the rare novels of true lasting value, combining poignancy, sorrow, mystery -- so many human emotions -- with inexorable suspense. I have never read anything like it.	2005-04-20

It lacked that magic because the heroine here, Isabel Dalhousie, is a mouse compared to the lionness of Precious Ramotswe.  Isabel is a mouse because she is mired in philosophical hair-splitting.  She can't figure out that it is moral and good to warn her niece against marriage to a philanderer, and only does so against her rational judgment, in a moment of instinctual truth-telling.  Mma Ramotswe is a lionness because she is imbued with moral purpose.  She may be undecided at times how to solve an issue, but she has no doubt where right and wrong lie, and who is right and who is wrong.  Isabel may be editor of the Review of Applied Ethics, but she flounders in a sea of obfuscatory rhetoric.  Mma Ramotswe cuts right to the chase.  She lives ethics, she takes in and nurtures orphans, she is interested in her neighbors and her community, she has a kind word and a greeting for all who cross her path.  Hers are the ethics that are truly applied.  Isabel by contrast leads a cold, self-centered life. Aside from intellectual pursuits, her only personal interest in life is her niece, an adult young woman who is quite self sufficient and needs only a nudge in the direction of the right man. While Isabel spends long paragraphs ruminating over the finer points of Kantian philosophy, her personal life is unpeopled, with only a few, carefully edited companions allowed entrance.  Her encounters are coincidence which serve to move the mystery, such as it is, forward, though at a sodden pace.  The author strews red herrings in the path of reader and detective, but when the guilty party is revealed, the moment is almost tossed away. The result is a novel that feels both too long and too quickly wrapped up.<br /><br />Perhaps the malaise that seems to hang over this book lies in its setting, a stodgy Edinburgh (I hope we all know it's pronounced Ehdinburrah), which seems gray and dull compared to Gaborone, depicted as a veritable African paradise (though with a few serpents swiftly dispatched by Mma Ramotswe's clever strategems and homespun wisdom).  By contrast, the chicanery in Edinburgh is of a different nature, financially sophisticated, untraceable, unprovable.  Perhaps the author's feelings about Scotland compared to Botswana, the emotional sunlight that permeates the latter and the intellectual chill the former, has influenced the tone and tenor of this most unsatisfying novel.ms gray and dull compared to Gaborone, depicted as a veritable African paradise (though with a few serpents swiftly dispatched by Mma Ramotswe's clever strategems and homespun wisdom).

I was a bit disappointed though that prominent pianists were given little coverage or not updated at all - Thibaudet, Andsnes, Hough, Lortie, Perahia - and pianists who are largely unknown to the public were updated, and highly praised.  This was puzzling to me.  I understand wanting to celebrate the careers of lesser known pianists, but why not also cover the careers of those who are performing at Carnegie Hall before the public?  I get the feeling that many of these biographical entries are not for the benefit of the reader, but for the pianists who are listed.  Yet the ordinary reader is the book's customer.  Surely we are worth a little regard.  More useful to the reader is the piano literature section of Part II.  There is a lot of interesting updating here, including Beethoven, Busoni, Godowsky, Medtner, and much more. The list of recommended recordings is helpfully expanded. But there is too much in Part I that seems like excess, and minor careers are overpraised.	2005-01-03

First, it is not a celebrity autobiography and it does not give the inside opera gossip. Thankfully, it is free of the nastiness that so many opera tell-alls seem to revel in.  This is the opposite, a gracious recounting of the creation of a diva's career.  Renee Fleming is the voice of experience.  Her discussion of vocal technique may be estoteric to general readers, but well the voice student knows how basic is breath support, and that the key to an aria's suitability is not the individual high notes, but the tessitura as a whole.  Renee Fleming is the best possible guide to making a lasting career, and she discusses her own mistakes candidly, such as choosing too difficult and unknown material for auditions.  No overnight success, she struggled for mastery.  She sounds like a balanced person with good basic values.  Every disappointment she suffered she managed to turn to her advantage.  For example, when she had to attend a state college rather than Oberlin for financial reasons, she found an excellent voice teacher there who helped in grounding her basic technique.  Renee Fleming tells us the high points of a diva's impossibly glamorous life, but she also tells us how painful and lonely it is to tour without family and friends.  Years ago, I observed an attractive, friendly woman who was attending a Cecelia Bartoli appearance at Tower Records - she was greeted warmly by her friends and called \\"Renee\\".  I realized that this must be Renee Fleming.  This book is the woman I saw -- pleasant, open, realistic, and nice.  And much more - knowledgeable about the needs of a career in opera, and generous in conveying her knowledge to others.  Ann Patchett, the novelist, is certainly behind the sure, artistic and professional prose style.  A lovely book of lasting value.	2004-12-16

This book is my choice because Gottlieb's book, while businesslike, is a bit earthbound.  Gottlieb's biography did not exude the spirit of dance for me.  And the biographical facts, reported in brief by both Gottlieb and Teachout, have been given more scope in Bernard Taper's wonderful full length biography.  In Teachout's favor, he is a dance critic, and he treats the dances themselves with more insight and depth.  As a reader, I feel this added to the book's value.  So the book I'll keep on my shelf is Terry Teachout's Balanchine.	2004-11-29

Now Meghan's first novel more than fulfills the promise of her earlier work. She has retained the writing style that made her essays so wonderfully readable, while casting a gimlet eye on her former shallowness. And she wraps it all up in a package of wit, humor, and dead-on satire. I won't bore you with another plot synopsis. Suffice it to say, the author seems to be searching for authenticity. Her critique is of superficial style, represented by the life she left behind in New York City. But she also skewers the women of Prairie City, with their blinkered, politically correct (P.C.?) sloganeering. And the illiterate e-mails from Lucinda's manic boss, Faye Figaro, are an absolute hoot. But it's her main character, Lucinda, subtly, skillfully drawn to represent Manhattan provincialism, who carries the novel's themes. That Meghan Daum has by now enough self knowledge to see clearly her own (and many of her readers') prejudices shows how far she has come since she lived in Manhattan.	2004-10-15

There is much to be learned here. As for the ethical question -- when you have been a guest in a famous man's home for a period of years, do you then write a book exposing the flaws of your host? It seems to violate the norms of hospitality, but then, what norms of civil behavior have not been violated in our out of bounds culture? But if David Dubal had not written this book, we piano lovers would all be the poorer. I keep Evenings with Horowitz on a central bookshelf in my library, where I often refer to it -- not least for the valuable discography and insightful comments on Horowitz' recordings. I only wish Dubal had been a guest of Franz Liszt in the 19th century -- what a book that would have been!	2004-10-15

Too bad he became obsessed with the stock market; well, as he admits, lots of ordinary Americans lost more than he did. This is a story of shallow values, false friends, and calculated social climbing.  Denby collected people with celebrity, charisma and most important, wealth. No wonder they betrayed him. He wasn't looking for good people, he was looking for glamorous people to use to enhance his social (and financial) standing.  Surprise - they used him instead.  It's an old story. Can't feel sorry for him, I'm afraid. There are a lot of dissatisfied people out there, people who will never have enough, and whose accomplishments will never give them happiness. Denby is one, his novelist wife who left their marriage for unspecified reasons is another. I downed this book in one gulp and returned it to the library the next day. Don't buy it. Do read it, and in conjunction with On Paradise Drive by David Brooks. It's the antidote to much happy theorizing about following one's American bliss.	2004-06-30

The tragic history of Mount Pelee, its fatal eruption and horrific aftermath, come alive in the words of contemporary witnesses (and many who did not survive).

Why did the author pursue a law degree long after the Nazis had come to power and it was apparent that Jewish lawyers had a limited future, to say the least, in Germany?  Why did the author remain in the country when she could have escaped, loyal to a selfish lover who refused to shelter her in her hour of greatest need?  It is clear why she became involved with and married a Nazi officer, less clear why she chose to bear his child.  The author's moral authority is weakened by her taking in, then abandoning, an orphan.  She seems to have hardened her heart to compassion in the interests of saving herself and her own daughter.  One moral can be drawn:  When the chips are down, practical skills can save your life.  The author, a trained lawyer, worked as a nurse's aide during the war and as a seamstress later.  Her German law degree proved as useless to her as her worthless first lover.	2001-01-03

I own the author's earlier book, Life at the Royal Ballet School, and this new book on the same subject unfortunately lacks magic and charm.  The text emphasizes the arduous aspects of the training, the difficulty and self sacrifice of the students.  The rewards of pursuing a great art are somehow given short shrift.  And inexplicably, the studio photos are uniformly grainy and indistinct.  The ballet students manage to seem awkward and unattractive.  I wish this book had conveyed the romance and beauty of ballet, as did the author's previous book on the Royal Ballet school.

I wanted to enjoy Longing, but it was so slow and meandering, I only longed for it to be over.  The minutiae of scholarship defeated me.

Suki Schorer tells us how Balanchine inspired her, how he acted, how he influenced generations of dancers and profoundly transformed the shape of ballet as an art. How fortunate we have this careful recounting of Balanchine's ballet technique from a true disciple, and that Balanchine's dancers are preserving his legacy, both on stage and via the written word.

However, as a novel, it is simply not that good.  There is not enough story-telling horsepower; it seems distinctly underpowered by plot.  The author's style, while intentionally  minimalist, leaves one longing for more.  Pearl Abraham is in the unique  position of having left her Hasidic upbringing for secular life, hence she  writes this autobiographical novel with a certain authority.  The vast  majority of Hasidic girls are content to marry within the fold and are  unlikely to write novels exposing their world.  Nor are most Hasidic women  likely to have Pearl Abraham's fluent English.  So Ms. Abraham has a  temporary exclusive, but her monopoly will not last forever.  There has to  be a writer who can describe ultra-Orthodox life with both an insider's  knowledge and an outsider's distance, and tell a good story while she's at  it.  This is an operatic subject, and it needs more than minimalist  writing.	2000-04-24

Hammer has accurately captured the ambience and atmosphere of the ultra-Orthodox world.  Unfortunately, his memory fails him on a lot of the details of halachic observance.  An expert should have carefully reviewed the manuscript before  publication.  But these flaws do not detract from the compelling story.  The psychological implications are telling: the more sensitive brother,  Tuvia, is drawn to religious life, seeking the warmth of family and the  acceptance he may have lacked growing up in the shadow of a talented older  brother.  He finds close community in the ultra-Orthodox world and a father  substitute in a charismatic Hasidic rabbi.  The book also reveals the  economic underpinnings of a society where men are not expected to earn a  living, yet father large families.  The families live in poverty, supported  by the pittance wives can earn in home businesses and by minimal stipends  from the yeshiva.  Friends do favors, even the impoverished give to those  less well off than themselves.  But the major economic support is provided  by well-to-do secular parents, who pay for housing, tuition, and everything  else their children and grandchildren need.  It is a system in which the  compassion - and guilt feelings - of parents are fully exploited.  The  wives shoulder a greatly disproportionate burden, and they, too, are fully  exploited.  Hammer does not go much beyond reportage, and one would have  liked deeper analysis and thoughtfulness.  But the facts speak for  themselves.  This is a window on a subculture most readers would not  otherwise have the access to penetrate.	2000-04-06

Kssechinska met Tchaikovsky in 1893, she was mistress of Tsarevich Nicholas, later Nicholas II, she worked with Diaghilev.  She was a celebrated ballerina in her own time, and led a life of supreme luxury, villas conveniently supplied by her lovers, all Grand Dukes. Her collection of jewels was admired by her friend, Anna Pavlova. Although forced to give up her first love, Nicholas, when he made a dynastic marriage, she recounts that he always looked after her interests.  Whenever she was denied a part due to the machinations of her enemies, she had only to send the Tsar a message, and she was reinstated.  How lovely a life!  She became mistress of another Grand Duke, several years her junior, and bore his son out of wedlock in 1902.  They were only able to marry after the Revolution, with the permission of the head of the Imperial Family in exile.  A marriage between a member of the Imperial Family and a ballerina would of course have been unthinkable in pre-Revolutionary Russia.  In the Revolution, she lost her villas, dachas, golden cups, luxurious furnishings and exquisite gowns, but she and her family escaped with their lives.  No small accomplishment.  This is a fascinating life of a remarkable woman and ballerina.  It quite surpasses the memoirs of any ballerina of our own time, because of its vivid depiction of a bygone age.  Dancing in Petersburg is a box seat on history, not just ballet history.	1999-11-17

There is even a handwritten letter from his famous teacher,  Olga Samaroff, filled with wise advice.  The International Piano Archives  and Tim Page deserve kudos for compiling this material.	1999-09-28

It was the epitome of romance for me then, and in the years since I feel the same.  I hope my  teenaged nieces read this novel, and any young girl who loves a truly  quality romantic suspense story.  Today we have pornography instead of  love, explicit violence takes the place of the aura of danger, heightened  by imagination.  This book is for the sensitive, those who are yet unjaded  by the surfeit of sensation purveyed today in films and trashy novels.  This is a beautiful story, full of fascination.  It does start slowly, but  so does Jane Eyre.  The heroine in both must reach a mysterious and dark  stranger, and win his love.  What a spark for a young girl's imagination!	1999-08-25

Unlike other readers who found it uninsightful, I found in the simple telling of this terrible story ample insights for the perceptive reader.  The prevailing confessional genre of our day has desensitized us, and led  us to expect a memoirist to bare his soul, beat his breast, bemoan his fate.  Such antics would be antithetical to a man of dignity, and Professor Gay  always retains his dignity.  It is enough that he describes faithfully, but  with detachment, his daily life in Nazi Germany as a youth.  We supply the  necessary subtext.  Gay need only relate dispassionately his bike ride  on the morning after Kristallnacht, and the sensitive reader understands  that there are things that cannot be made explicit, but that must be  inferred.  He tells the reader his father's non-Jewish partner expropriated  his business.  He describes without emotion how, a top student, he was  expelled from school at age 15.  He describes the trashing of his  relatives' dry goods store.  He shows us a picture of his lovely blond  aunt, who played \\"Germania\\" at a school pageant, and tells us she  was killed by the Nazis.  He describes how his family finally managed to  escape at the eleventh hour and come to America.  He relates how his father  worked uncomplainingly at a physically taxing factory job.  I would not  cavil at what Gay does not include.  Peter Gay has done us a great service  by undertaking the wrenching job of writing this book, obviously for the  sake of the historical record.  He writes as a historian. Do not ask for  passion.  The feeling is inherent in the narrative, at least for the  sensitive reader.	1999-07-27
US	49608174	RZJA30KCU88IG	0486265439	648172072	Men, Women and Pianos: A Social History (Dover Books on Music)	Books	4	39	40	N	N	A History of the Piano for the True Aficionado	This book can be tough going at times -- over 600 pages of text alone, densely written, finely detailed, full of endless descriptions of how early pianos were built in the great days of Cristoferi and Silbermann.  Then why  read this book?  Because it is, simply, fascinating.  There are chapters on  the role of the piano in the works of Jane Austen, the piano as an aid to  courtship, on Beethoven's paean to his Broadwood, on the quest for  &quot;brilliant but not difficult&quot; music, long descriptions of 19th  century mechanical devices of pianistic torture -- there is a great deal of  interesting esoterica here, and much to learn.  The book is a classic, and  I'm glad it's on my bookshelf.	1999-07-14
