I was really excited to read this novel after hearing how fantastic it was.  I was disappointed.  Did Wolfe capture the essence of college life nowadays?  Probably.  Did it have the feel of being vulgar just to be vulgar?  Yep.  Charlotte Simmons character was rather one-sided and got a bit annoying after a while.  The length of the book really could have been cut back, too.  I wouldn't recommend it as a \\"must-read\\".	2005-03-26

If I wouldn't have had to finish it for the meeting, I probably wouldn't have.  The characters were too shallow, the plot wasn't really that believeable, and the riddles got to be annoying after a while.  I did like the relationship between Tom and Paul and how the authors developed that, but that was about the only saving grace of the book.  The plot was pretty predictable and I wasn't too surprised at the ending.  There didn't seem to be a feeling of tension or climax at the end, and that was disappointing.	2005-03-26

We both read it and loved it.  Finally someone is willing to say what is going on with males in our society.  It is heartbreaking to think of all our boys have to deal with in this world, but Dr. Dobson offers sound advice based on his belief in Christ.  If you aren't a Christian, don't read this book - find another resource because he relies heavily on the teachings of the Bible and you probably won't like it. <br /> <br />I know the liberals of this world want to believe that our society is much better off than generations past, but anyone who has eyes can see that it's not.  We need to get back to the values that built this great country and Dr. Dobson shows you how you can do that with your sons.  Sound advice and valuable reading.	2004-12-04

I definitely recommend it for all parents of toddlers.  It was nice to get some common-sense advice that didn't serve to make me feel like a bad mother because I expect my child to entertain himself sometimes, sleep in his own bed alone, and behave when we are out in public.  My favorite tidbit from the book is the thought that our toddlers are uncivilized and our job as parents is to civilize them.  It helped me put our discipline attitudes in perspective and remember to teach, not punish.  I also liked the fact that the author used many of his own life experiences as a basis for his advice.  I appreciate advice more from someone who has been there and done that and understands our struggles.	2004-12-04

I love the way the author brings the characters together through their love of reading (and eating) and how she weaves important books of the time into the story.  The characters really came to life for me and I felt for each of them when they suffered or rejoiced.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book!	2004-05-14

I agree with other reviewers, in that, this book seems to be more about her life and what she went through than trying to help adoptive parents in general.  I'm sorry that she had a bad experience with adoption, but not all situations are like hers.  The first four chapters illustrate how much she dislikes the very idea of adoption and really makes me feel, as a prospective adoptive parent, that I will never be able to make my adopted child feel loved, secure, and wanted.  The numerous references to psychologists doing work in the \\"primal scream\\" arena put me off more than just a little bit.  By the time I was done reading the first night, I was convinced that my adoptive child would grow up to be a animal-torturing, anorexic, sexually promiscuous, serial killer.  Then I realized that's ridiculous!  Every child, whether biological or adoptive, goes through similar issues in growing up.  Do adoptive kids sometimes have more issues to work through?  Sure.  <br />Here's what you should take from this book- be open and honest with your adoptive kids, allow them to feel their feelings, and try your best to create a stable, loving home for them where they feel secure.  Isn't that what adoptive parents strive to do anyway?	2003-06-20

I got this book from my mom after we found out we are pregnant with our first baby.  I love Vicki's style of writing - it really does feel like a girlfriend is sitting down with you and telling you all the things you really need to know about pregnancy and babies.  She offers fantastic advice and I've picked up many a handy hint.  <br />The only thing I don't particularly care for about this book is her handling of the husbands.  I think her attitude plays down their role in a pregnancy and makes them out to be idiots who can't figure anything out, will never do anything right, and don't deserve to be a part of the pregnancy.  I feel like husbands are an integral part of the whole process and should not be dismissed or disregarded.<br />Overall, I would still recommend this book because the advice and information is invaluable to a new mommy-to-be.	2002-05-15

At first I thought \\"science fiction?! no way!\\", but after reading about it here on amazon, I was intrigued.  People going into classic works of literature and possibly changing the texts forever?!  I started reading it and was hooked!  Fforde is so creative in his use of the English language (the names are fantastic!) and his blending of futuristic ideas and classic works of literature.  What's interesting is that this book, although futuristic-feeling, is set in the past - nearly 20 years ago!  I would highly suggest this to anyone looking for an intriguing novel that offers a change of pace from the \\"Oprah book club\\"-type novels that are flooding the market right now.  The ending seems to leave it open to a series - please come out with a new book as soon as possible, Mr. Fforde!!!	2002-05-15

I received this from my husband as a gift and love it!  It's great to pull out every day and read what is happening with your baby that day.  There are many spots to write in how you are feeling, cravings, your weight, and other bits of information that you will love to look at years down the road.  The advice and suggestions interspersed are really helpful, too.  I would recommend getting this as soon as you know you are pregnant.

I read this for a book group - and that's the only reason I managed to finish it.  I was so annoyed by the parents in this story that I could hardly stand it!  I understand that during this time period rape was more of an embarrassment to your family and that people were ashamed of it, but come on!  I guess I just find it hard to believe that a mother would ship her daughter off without a word to anyone just to make her husband feel better because he doesn't have to see his daughter anymore.  Honestly, Marianne was the only character I could relate to and the only character I wanted to come out of the whole mess intact.  I think Judd was an inconsistent and unreliable narrator and, quite frankly, got a little annoying with all the \\"I just want to be part of the family\\" business at the beginning of the story.  The ending was also a little too neat with an \\"everyone's okay and happy\\" scenario that was a little unbelieveable after seeing how these people treated each other through the rest of their lives together.<br />I've always enjoyed reading Oates' writing, but this is one I would recommend not spending your time on.	2002-05-15

I had to keep reminding myself while reading this that a teacher wrote it.  Not just any teacher, either.  A teacher who was awarded several &quot;Teacher of the Year&quot; awards.  His powerful words make sense and made me realize that homeschooling is definitely the best choice for my family.  His focus on shifting the emphasis back to the family is fantastic - if only this notion would catch on with the general population.  It's sad to see the &quot;Seven Lessons&quot; teachers teach their students.  It was even sadder for me to read it and be able to totally identify with it from my government school background.  Doesn't every parent want better for their kids?  This book will help you see what that better option is and give you the reasons why you should choose it.	2002-03-01

I had a really hard time getting into the story and believing the characters.  I do agree with other reviewers that it is more literary than a lot of books out there, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a great book.  <br />I do like some of the wordplay and imagery Franzen uses.  He is excellent with using language to create emotion and images that make you think.  However, some of his writing gets a little too over the top and it becomes hard to follow at all.<br />The characters are really hard to understand because they are so dysfunctional and poorly developed.  You really don't feel much for any of them because you just don't care.<br />Would I recommend this to family and friends? No. I am reading it with a friend of mine who wanted to read it - I wouldn't have chose to read it otherwise.	2002-02-12

I couldn't put it down!  I love the way Maxwell took a tiny, barely mentioned historical &quot;fact&quot; and created a story with it that takes you on adventures, across the seas, and into battles during the reign of Queen Elizabeth.  While the basic history is accurate, keep in mind that this is a work of historical fiction and will not be as accurate as a textbook.

This is quite possibly one of the most heartbreaking stories you will ever read.  Imagine being a young black girl when the ideal is a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Shirley Temple-type, and being told constantly (both directly and indirectly) that you are ugly.  Imagine growing up as the scapegoat for everyone else to take their anger and frustration out on - the whole time dreaming of how you could someday have beautiful blue eyes.  Imagine the madness you retreat into just to live in the world of your creation - where you have those beautiful blue eyes and nobody can hurt you any more.

He captured the feelings of this young woman in such a way that I couldn't believe it was a male author.  The character of Dolores makes you want to cry and laugh at the same time - you feel sorry for her and keep hoping that she makes it in the end.

Amanda couldn't have known that her secret would have the outcome that it did, but she had to live with the consequences nonetheless.  It really makes you think about the ramifications of the actions you take in your own life.<br />I loved the imagery in this book - you can almost feel the cold, dampness of the Wisconsin farm.  Living in the Milwaukee area, I know the kind of winters she describes and can imagine the gray bleakness over the entire story.  The water imagery is the other thing that struck me about this story.  Water has been long used as a symbol of birth.  In this case, it was death that was associated with the water but also a strange kind of birth - the birth of how Amanda and Ruth's lives would be forever changed and played out.<br />It's definitely worth the read!!	2001-05-23

I agree with those who have given this book a poor review, in that, there really is nothing in it that you don't already know.  However, I disagree that it is a waste of time to read.  It is very easy in today's busy world to forget what you already know -- and that is that change happens.  Yes, change happens every day and we are constantly dealing with it.  However, sometimes it is easy to get stuck in a rut and resist change.  If being conscious of a problem is half the battle, then how can this book be all bad? It definitely raises your awareness of how change affects all of us and provides simple ways to deal with it.  I won't say it's the best book I've ever read, but it's definitely worth the 30 minutes it will take you to read it.	2000-11-04

I am glad I did because it was worth it.  Novalee's character really pulls you into the story and the way the author develops  her throughout the story is wonderful.  At the end, you are almost as proud  of her as her mother would be.  I cried when Sister Husband died and cried  when Novalee finally found love.
