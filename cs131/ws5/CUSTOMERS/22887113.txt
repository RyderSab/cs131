When Unlimited Power came out in the 1980's, the concepts were new and revolutionary. Few knew anything about NLP (Neuro-Linguistic-Programming). <br /> <br />While Tony didn't invent NLP, he did do the most to popularize  it. And I am 100% behind Tony with his NAC (neuro-associative-conditioning) As Tony explains, these techniques do offer immediate results but like physical exercise they must be repeated periodically or the effect is lost. I know it happened to me. <br /> <br />United Power teaches both conventional mind conditioning in concert with NLP/NAC. The combination is very powerful. <br /> <br />Good book by Tony Robbins and easy to see whay it has been a best seller now for nearly 20 years.	2005-09-29

I have always taken good notes and tested myself on anything that I have read to make the material come to life. After reading Think & Grow Rich and after reading so many positive reviews here, I decided to go out and buy this one as well. To tell you the truth, it was sort of anticlimatic. The exercises were good, but I pretty much figured that out for myself without the guide.<br /><br />I had already read Think & Grow Rich at least a dozen times so thought I knew this material cold..and I did. BUT....when I went to the back of the book and took the 5 examinations, I had to admit that I knew what Napolean Hill wanted as answers but couldn't truly say in all honesty that I was where I needed to be or wanted to be in the five categories listed.<br /><br />So I went to work on my weak areas which I thought I didn't have before reading this book. This part of the book alone was for me, well worth the price of buying this version of Think and Grow Rich.<br /><br />I think a lot of people will benefit from the Action Pack because so many people I know will read the book once and think they've got it. The action pack will make you roll up your sleeves, clear the mental cobwebs, learn the material but even more importantly, make the material bring out the qualities inside you that lead to success.	2005-09-29

I carry this one in my briefcase and read while I am on the road. I also own a copy of the new hardback edition too which has some additional information as well.<br /><br />Also highly recommend Hill's other classic, The Law of Success. That one is really heavy reading, over 1,000 pages and is the actual course that Hill taught many years ago.<br /><br />It has been said that Hill is responsible for creating more millionaires than any other person in history. It has also been said that virtually all of the personal development trainers, authors and speakers have based their material on Napolean Hill's work.

To the reviewer who said he would spend the money on paint instead, I say first buy this book and actually read it, then go out and buy some paint, but first, you will have to buy some rental properties. <br /> <br />Isn't it funny how people who are not in this business bash authors like Dolf de Roos? I also get a kick out of the reviewer who says he hates Dolf de Roos, but buys all of his books and goes to all of his seminars! C'mon! If I bought a book by someone I didn't like, I'd be a darn fool to buy another one. Who are you trying to kid? <br /> <br />This book is all about making property improvements with minimal expenditures. You will find ways you never thought of before.

What appealed to me about this great book by Dolf de Roos is <br /> <br />1) It was written by an actual real estate investor who was <br />   writing from his own personal experiences <br /> <br />AND <br /> <br />2) This book is different from the other real estate books which <br />   all more or less same the same things. <br /> <br /> <br />Dolf does a great job showing that that real estate is still the best investment, actually tens and hundreds of times better than any other investment including and especially the stock market. <br /> <br />Dolf will show you how to find the deal of the decade every week! <br /> <br />How to massively increase the value of your property without spending too much money. <br /> <br />olf also explains how the government can subsidize your real investments and how to create passive income using your bankers money so that you only work if you want to. <br /> <br />My main business is network marketing. I have found Dolf de Roos real estate advice not only providing me with an additional stream of passive income, but also taken a chunk out of my tax bill as well. <br /> <br />If you looking for another \\"Nothing Down\\" or \\"Get Rich Quick\\" book on real estate, look elsewhere. This book can however show you how to get richer quicker with proven strategies.  <br /> <br />Great book. Highly recommended.	2005-05-23

I got turned on to real estate by a fellow networker who is using real estate both to create an additional residual income stream and to offset taxable income from his lucrative network marketing business.     The Rich Dad series of book are excellent and I  highly recommend them to everyone in my downline and to everyone that I know.     What appealed to me about Ken McElroy's great book, The ABC's of Real Estate Investing is that it was written by a man experienced in real estate, not just someone writing books on a popular subject to make a living. Ken McElroy owns one of the largest real estate development companies in the Southwestern United States. He speaks from experience.    Also this book covers topics left untouched by other authors. And I like the fact that McElroy says there are no \\"get-rich-quick\\" tricks in real estate, just proven methods that deliver bottom line profits and increased property value.    I highly recommend The ABC's of Real Estate Investing along with Real Estate Riches by Dolf de Roos. This information will positively affect your bottom line.	2005-05-23

If you are brand new to real estate investing, then I  highly recommend Robert Allen's classic Nothing Down,  now revised in a new edition. However, if you have read some of the other no money down R.E. books or other R.E. books on the market, you can probably skip this one. <br /> <br />Robert Allen's Nothing Down techniques have not changed that much since the first edition came out in 1980. The nothing down strategies are about the same that have been pushed by everybody from Dave Deldotto, Wade Cook, Charles Givens, Charleton Sheets, Al Lowry, Russ Whitney and so on. <br /> <br />An important point: Robert Allen was the first! <br /> <br />Allen was the first. Do they work? Absolutely! I bought several rental properties using Nothing Down techniques. So if you are brand new to R.E. Investing, read and use Allens techniques. <br /> <br />And please disregard the ngative reviews. Allen like other successful businessmen and in demand, best selling authors, gets bashed usually by the jealous and the broke who have nothing more to do with their time. By the way, I'm in network marketing so you can say I am used to the the bullcrap, misconceptions, bashing and outright lies about anything that works and anybody that is successful. <br /> <br />Interesting how people will applaud with someone wins the lottery but look with ambivelence upon anyone with self earned wealth.  <br /> <br />Disregard the 1 star reviewers. To use a quote that Robert Allen frequently uses; \\"they just don't know any better.\\" <br /> <br />Nothing Down is a good book, but you will need more. I highly recommend the Rich Dad advisors books by Dolf de Roos and Ken McElroy. <br /> <br />	2005-05-23

I am continually fascinated by the great works of the late, great Napolean Hill. Being familiar with Hill, I was surprised to find this title, one which I never heard of before on my favorite books tore shelf. I appears that with the renewed interest in personal development, pma and motivation, many of Hill's previously published works are resurecting. And I am glad for that.<br /><br />This booki s divided into two sections, 21 chapters and over 200 pages. It is pure meat, no nonsense. Great stuff from the master himself. In particular, the chapter on the top qualities of the master salesman and insights into Henry Ford's philosophy were outstanding.<br /><br />I know some of Napolean Hill's detracters will attack this book based on it's age, but this information is timeless. And who wouldn't want to take a peek into the minds of great business/salesmen like Henry Ford? This book shows you how.<br /><br />There is a lot of talk today about consultative selling techniques. In How To Sell Your Way Through Life, particularly in chapters 10 and 11, Hill talks about consultive selling, qualifying the prospect and neutralizing your prospective buyers mind.<br /><br />In chapter 12, The Art of Closing The Sale, Hill explains how to close sales and how to keep them closed; produce  happy customers and practilly eliminate buyers remorse. He tells an interesting story of a cadillac car salesman from Maryland and how these strategies made a huge difference.<br /><br />Of course some of the information will be familiar to Hill fans like The MAster Mind strategy and others. Overall a great book by a great man. Must reading for all serious salespeople.	2005-05-16

I have to admit that I was not initially a fan of Tom Hopkins. To me he comes across like a used car salesman with a high pressure type of sales tactic.    My business is network marketing, and we use a soft sell approach. I was conferring with the top rep in my group who is making some insane income in our company. I asked him what he attributed to his success and he mentioned several books and tapes, but when it comes to selling, he said Tom Hopkins is tops.    I was at my favorite bookstore on Friday and was happy to see that the new and and revised version of this book was just released. It has a purple cover and large print. Over 420 pages loaded with information. I spent four hours non stop reading this great text, the most informative sales book that I have ever read. This is indeed the bible of salemanship.    Nice intro by Mr. Hopkins mentor, the late J. Douglas Edwards. Then on to what makes a great saleman. Chapter after chapter by Hopkins covering every aspect of selling. I used some of Hopkins techniques earlier today, qualifying prospects and working on presentation skills ala Tom Hopkins. I began to use \\"tiedowns\\" and the the \\"ben franklin close\\" and have to admit I felt a little silly at first, but it worked!    I can't wait untill I truly master all of the skills Mr. Hopkins presents in this masterpiece. Then I will really be dangerous.    Right now I am only halfway though the book. Wait untill I finish it and master these skills!    Thank you Tom Hopkins and Warner Books for releasing this new and revised version.	2005-05-16

I have been a fan of Napolean Hill since 1975 when I enrolled in my first network marketing company and Think &amp; Grow Rich was practilly required reading for everyone. Later I found out that those who read Think &amp; Grow Rich (as well as other positive mind books) excelled while those who didn't were left behind.<br />Someone recommended The Law of Success. At first I just saw it as an inflated version of Think &amp; Grow Rich and didn't see the value. Then I met another network marketer who made nearly $3 million in under 2 years (in 1970's dollars!) and credited Hill's books, especially this one and Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude and Think and Grow Rich. He told me that Think &amp; Grow Rich will get your interest, but The Law of Success would make me rich. <br />I recall the price of The Law of Success was around $20 (a lot of money in 1976 considering I bought Think &amp; grow Rich for $1.95) for the 2 volume set. So I set a goal to buy the book set with the profits from my business, that is extra sales or residual checks on top of what I was already making. <br />Shortly thereafter, I bought the set and dove into the program. Reading a chapter a day, this was on top of reading other motivational material. My sales exploded. My attitude changed. And I thought I already had a good attitude!<br />Hill goes much deeper into the 17 principles in The Law of Success and in this updated version, while Hills ideas remain intact, the material is revised for the times, there are new quotes and new material.<br />This is also in one paperback book instead of two hardbacks. It is easier to read and packed with material that goes beyond what you will find in Hill's others books.<br />Since my old copies are all dog eared and worn, I went out and spent the $34 and bought the new &amp; improved version over the weekend and again feel stimulated. It jogged my memory and gave me many new ideas for my new pursuit. I am now recommending this book to everyone and anyone who wants success. <br />If you liked Think &amp; Grow Rich, you will love The Law of Success. It's Hill's best work and the new and revised version is better than the original.	2004-07-08

You also have Silver's unique philosophy.<br />In particular, I liked Silvers technique for making my own self hypnosis tapes, recording them on a answering machine endless tape and then letting it play over and over all nite long with relaxing music int he background. As Silver indicates, the one voice that you trust the most is your own.

The man is very elequent to be sure, a great public speaker but also knows this business inside and out. And he has the best tools. <br />I began listening to Randy's tape &quot;Secrets of  a Dynamic Day&quot; over and over. This wasn't a hype you up, rah-rah tape, it discussed the necessities of building your business. Randy suggested listening to it first thing in the morning. I listened to it twice per day.<br />Randy also had a tape called &quot;Escape The Rat Race&quot;, a generic tape that we would hand out to prospects. It was all about downsizing that had escalated at that time and it was the best prospecting tool that I had used.<br />I listened to Randy's tape set over and over. This guy is a real nut's and bolts sort of guy. He tells you what to do and what not to do. Having just left a herbal nutrition company that had collapsed combined with some real bad training by the company founder, I was eager to find something that worked. Randy's advice did and still does work.<br />How To Build a Multi Level Money Machine is Randy's best work to date. You will learn the science of netowrk marketing, what works and what doesn't work. You will also learn some of the schemes and scams perpetrated by mlm'ers. You will learn how to pick the right company and which companies to avoid. <br />I highly recommend How To Build a Multi Level Money Machine.

While I agree that network marketing organizations are configured in the form of a pyramid,  so are billion dollar corporations, schools and churhes.<br />It is not illegal. Nor should it be. <br />In normal corporate management, you start at the bottom and have to try to pass those above you (good luck!) In most cases, it takes 25-40 years to move up that pyramid.<br />In network marketing, you also start at the bottom but can pass anyone who is above you in your line of sponsorship. You are not limited. In network marketing, you have the option to do in 2-5 years what takes most people 25-40 years (if they ever make it) to do the conventional way.<br />MARY AND WAYNE do an excellent job explaining network marketing and offer a system to literally make your first million. <br />Going back to my opeing line, why am I happy and amused about the critics of network marketing? It's very simple, when this great method of marketing becomes obvious to the masses, the opportunity will be gone. As long as there will be critics, there will also be critics. Sort of like franchising back in the 60's (franchising was almost shut down by the government in 1963) At that time, nobody would touch it. Now you can't get a good franchise in a good location anymore. It will happen to MLM too. That is why I am building now before that happens.<br />Good book Wayne and Mary.

It starts off with a guest who gets invited to a network marketing presentation, get's all excited, signs up and then meets the greatest network marketer in the world.<br />As the story begins to unfold, our newbie expects training by the greatest network marketer in the world but gets taken back when he is taken first to the greatest network marketer in the worlds ranch and then to a baseball diamond and has him coaching a little league team. Our protagonist begins to get ansy wondering when the real training is to begin.<br />Over the course of the next few chapters we learn (and so does the new distributor) that he is already being trained! The fact is, the way you train a new distibutor to build a network marketing organization is the same way you coach a little league team. You empower people, train them and give them love and guidance.<br />In the late 90's, I had all of my distributors read this book. Those who did and reread it over and over and applied the principles, made the most progress. <br />This book is not just great for newbies, but a great reminder for us veterans as well. I just rediscovered this book after having had it packed it away and it is already making amajor change in my business. <br />Try it. You'll like it.	2004-07-08

Books	5	2	2	N	N	Motivational and facked with value	I really enjoyed The Greatest Networker in the World and conversations provides more of the story, picks up where The Greatest Networker leaves off.<br />The Greatest Networker is written in story book style much like The 1 Minute Millionaire by Allen &amp; Hansen but still packs facts that will be useful to help you build your organization. The problem is that when most people start in network marketing, they are clueless on what to do and get easily frustrated. Conversations and the prequel, The Greatest  Networker in the World will get you and your downline off to a fast start. I also recommend The Wave 4 Way to Building Your Downline and Wave 4. And of course, I recommend The 1 Minute Millionaire by Allen &amp; Hansen as well as Multiple Streams of Income by Robert Allen. <br />These are great books that will explode your business. It's working for me.	2004-07-08

I have many tapes from Hansen that were promoted by SMI many years ago. And I have read some of Robert Allens books, most notably Multiple Streams of Income, Nothing Down and Creating Wealth.<br />I'm in network marketing and am h appy to see prominent people like Robert Allen, Mark Victor Hansen, Robert Kiyosaki, Brian Tracy and others promoting this concept of wealth creation.<br />As everybody knows by now, The 1 Minute Millionaire is both fictional and non fictional. The fictional part is a story about a mother who must create income quickly. The non fiction part showcases Hansen's and Allen's most famous strategies. As a result this book is both inspiring and educational.<br />I recommend The 1 Minute Millionaire for anyone. It can change your life.	2004-07-07

For people opposed to network marketing (I'm very bullish on network marketing), that's o kay, Allen offer many other strategies to create wealth. In fact, to create Multiple Streams of Income.<br />For me, the best and safest way to create multiple streams of income is via network marketing. With network marketing, you can use the same power of leverage that Allen uses and suggests in his real estate books. It is the same principle that Donald Trump used to become a billionaire. In fact, speaking of Donald Trump, several years ago The Donald was on a tv talk show and when asked if he had to start over again, what would he do differently. Trump said he would find a good network marketing company and go to work!<br />Personally, I feel that everyone should set up a network marketing business. It's low cost, can be started part, part time and you can create a high income rapidly  if you are with the right company and put forth the right effort.<br />Enough of network marketing. It's a winning stategy and I am glad that Robert Allen understands it and is recommending it.<br />Allen also discusses real estate. He explains how to buy real estate with no money down and using the power of leverage. He also discusses tax liens and discounted mortgages. Both powerful ways to create passive income and again, Allen shows you ways to invest in these power packed strategies with no money down.<br />Allen also discusses how to be an intropreneur (not my choice) and  how to use the internet.<br />All in all, Multiple Streams of Income is a powerful book that can add many streams of income to your income portfolio. Much better strategy than relying on just 1 income streams---a job.<br />AND the good  news is that anybody can start any of these strategies right now while you are working at your job. They can all be started part, part time with little or no investment and create cash flow immediately.<br />Great book Mr. Allen. I recommend it.	2004-07-07

This installment in the Rich Dad series Retire Young Retire Rich is also subtitled How To Get Rich Quickly and Stay Rich Forever.<br />Kiyosaki tells us that it took Rockefeller 16 years to become a billionaire in his time. And it took Bill Gates 10 years to reach the billion dollar status. However it took Mike Dell and Steve Case only 5 years to become billionaires. It's easier than ever.<br />In Retire Young Retire Rich, Kiyosaki pounds to death the concept of leverage. One chapter I found interesting was the leverage of generosity. Kiyosaki discusses how his Rich Dad taught him reciprocity and service. He states an age old law &quot;Give and you shall recieve.&quot; Kiyosaki says thath is rich dad taught him that if you want to be rich, you must first be willing to serve as many people as possible.<br />Aaccording to Kiyosaki, Rich Dad believed inthe law of reciprocity and in the idea of being generous was the best way to  becoming very, very rich.<br />Kiyosaki also talks about networks and network marketing. He goes on to discuss the power of networks and the importance of leverage ratios and goes on to say that you can b ecome exceptionally wealthy in a short period of time by doing so and at a fraction of the cost.<br />I noticed that Retire Young Retire Rich is recommended here by a Nationally recognized CPA. I am glad that people of quality appreciate Rich Dad's and Robert Kiyosaki's work.<br />I'm with a company that does business around the world and the most successful people I know are exercising the concepts espoused by Kiyosaki and are becoming very wealthy as a result.<BR>So can you.	2004-07-07

The fact is your income is not your wealth, only potential wealth. You can live off your income, but you can't get wealthy off your income. You only get wealthy by investing and the proper use of money strategies.<br />Dave Bach offers powerful money strategies that really work. The first and most important one is to pay yourself first. You must save at the very least, 10% of what you earn before you pay any bills. Isn't it amazing that Americans have such great difficulty saving 10% while the Asians save over 30%!<br />I know some Doctors who earn a 6 figure income, but are always broke and have nothing to show for it. $150,000 income is nothing when you are spending $175,000.<br />Bach also offers strategies to cut your mortgage payoff time in half. Pay off credit card debt in 2-3 years, not 5-10 years and more.<br />I'm with a company that does business in 10 different countries. Our company did over $40 million in sales in it's first year and has created several millionaires in 17 months. Some of the millionaires in this company highly recommend Bach's advice and live by it. That's why they are millionaires. EARNING MONEY IS THE EASY PART. KEEPING IT IS THE DIFFICULT PART. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD!<br />I can't rave enough about Dave Bach's book. I also have his tape set from Nightingale-Conant which goes even deeper into the strategies than this book does.	2004-06-17

As another reviewer has already alluded to, 75% of Fortune 500 companies utilize Zig's training systems. And Zig has trained over 1,000 network marketers. Zig was also successful himself as a network marketer and in direct sales. He speaks from experience.<br />More importantly, Zig is a great trainer. He knows how to bring out the best in everyone. And co author John P. Hayes has his own powerful credentials.<br />This book is particularly good for newbies in network marketing. Zig will show you how to pick your first company, what to look for, what to look out for and to what to avoid. He gives his usual motivational tips and it is updated to include the internet.<br />If you are new to network marketing, then I cannot recommend this book enough. Also recommend Mark Yarnels excellent book, Your First Year in Network Marketing.	2004-06-16

His classic article, &quot;Network  Marketinng: The Most Powerful Way to Reach Consumers in the 90's&quot;, May 1990, literally opened the floodgates for network marketing articles and the wave of excitement for network marketing which has carried over to the new millenium.<br />The book is split up into 3 parts and 19 chapters. What I found particularly interesting was part two: The 7 Traits of an MLM leader in which Poe starts off in chapter 6 discussing what makes a leader. He then goes on in detail the 7 traits which are<br />1) Drive<BR>2) Persistence<BR>3) Teachability<BR>4) Thick Skin<BR>5) Positive Attitude<BR>6) Compassion<BR>7) Vision<br />Poe draws from the wisdom of Xenophon, Napoleon, Sun Tzu and other historic leaders and instructs the ambitious networker in the timeless art of leading others. He desribes the network ma rketer as a freedom fighter, a leader, a business leader, an entrepreneur.<br />Poe is almost Reagan-like in saying that we cannot depend on the government to take of us, we need to take care of ourselves and he goes on to explain why network marketing may be the best vehicle to do that. <br />I highly recommend this book in addition to Wave 4 and Mark Yarnells excellent book, Your First Year in Network Marketing.	2004-06-16

Think & Grow Rich is my favorite. Law of Success is my second favorite and this one is next.<br />What I liked about this book is the addition of comments by Clement Stone along with Hill's prowess. Interesting, Stone credits Napolean Hill's philosophy for helping him amass his huge fortune.<br />At first glance, Success Through a PMA may appear to be just another version of Think & Grow Rich. There are some similiarities, but plenty of differences to make this book a   worthwhile read. <br />When I first got into network marketing in the 70's, I met a guy who made over $2 million in 18 months (in 1970 $$$!!!) and credits this book along with the right opportunity as being his secret to success.<br />Since following Hill's advice in this and Think and Grow Rich, I have achieved success far greater than I could have otherwise.<br />Great book in addition to Think & Grow Rich.	2004-06-16

His articles in Success Magazine, Network Marketing: The Most Powerful Way To Reach Consumers in the 90's, May 1990 and We Create Millionaires, February 1992 brought network marketing to the public and business communities. Wave 3 became an instant best seller and introduced the concept of mass marketed MLM--a new generation of network marketing opportunities that simplified and automated many aspects of the business. <br />No longer did distributors have to warehouse and deliver products, drive miles to meet prospects and send massive mailouts, now WAVE 3 networkers came to rely on drop shipping and auto ship programs, voice mail, 3 way conference calls, video passout, satellite broadcasts, fax-on-demand services and other technicalogical innovations to grow their businesses, faster, easier and better than ever before.<br />Now instead of coming home from work and going to a meeting, they can simply dial for dollars or put a prospect on a three way call with their sponsor. It also eliminated the cost of paying for expensive hotel rooms to host meetings.<br />You no longer had to order cases and cases of product, now you could be placed on auto ship and have your products delivered right to your door. And the company will also dropship the product right to your customers door. <br />With Wave 3 created tremdous growth in the 1990's. Today, publicly traded network marketing stocks are among the best performing stocks in the stock market. And an ever growing number of Fortune 500 companies are creating network marketing companies as separate divisions to market their products. Some examples include Citigroup, Avon, and Rexall.<br />As we are rapidly moving towards a jobless society, Network Marketing may be the average persons best change to survive in an economy where there are few jobs. In the 1990's, we saw corporate Americans flee from the corporate world to the network marketing, a tradition that has continued through to the 21st century.<br />Wave 3 started the revolution and is an excellent book. I would recommend Wave 4 in place or in addition to this one. And the WAVE 4 Way to building your downline.	2004-06-16

Like many other people, I had heard of Glen Turner, Koscot Interplanetary and Dare To Be Great. Like most people who rely solely on the news, I believed that Turner was a crook, a swindler and a thief. But at that time, I also believed that MLM was crooked and that Amway was a illegal pyramid scheme as well.<br />A friend of mine knew that I was into personal development and network marketing, had apparently come across some old tapes by Turner and gave them to me. <br />When I first listened to Turner, I thought he had a bad cold. Later I would find out that he had a harelip and consequently, a permanent speech impediment. Despite that, the man exuded enthusiasm that was incredible. I was glad that my friend gave me these tapes.<br />With the tapes came a book called &quot;Con Man or Saint?&quot; which reviewed the controversy behind this man. It was written by a pulitzer prize winner. I have no association with Turner other than these tapes and the book, but I came away feeling that this was a very unusual man.<br />Turner  literally turned the MLM industry on it's ear at that time. He was also able to turn $5000 into over $100 million in 2 years. That would be close to a billion in todays dollars. <br />I did some internet surfing on Turner and came across alot of stuff, most notably I found several articles by Jeffrey Gitomer, America's top sales trainer praising Turner and the positive impact that Turner had on his life as well as others.<BR>Gitomer also say's &quot;to get any tape by Glen that he ever did.&quot;<BR>After listening to the tape set, I agree. He is a great motivator.<br />While I can't say whether Glen Turner was/is a Con Man or  Saint, I do feel that the man did a lot more good for this industry that what some people give him credit for. His philosophy is making a major impact for me in the network marketing company that I am in right now. Gitomers book The Sales Bible is also a parcel in my wealth training library. I highly recommend it.<br />Ihave no idea what Turner is doing these days, but I would like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed your tapes and the book and if Turner happens to read this and is open for an opportunity, contact me<br />[...]	2004-06-16

A leader in a company that I was associated with suggested The Law of Success. He warned me that it would be a lot of reading. At that time it was two hard back copies, beautifully bound. <br />I asked him if the books helped him. He told me that this set helped him achieve a level of success that was previously unattainable to him. And he told me that this series was much more complete than Think &amp; Grow Rich---it was like attending class. Transcripts from actual Napolean Hill lectures.<br />I found that like Rich, these books helped me to go to levels that I could never reach before as well. Think &amp; Grow Rich planted the seeds and got my interest as well as offered powerful strategies. This 2 book set helped make more sense of the principles, tied things together.<br />The other Hill book that I strongly recommend is Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude. I know that even in todays world, some people bicker at the positive mind books...but guess what? They work!

Those were my thoughts as I was browsing books in the business section of my favorite book store. I already read Think &amp; Grow Rich, Law of Success and Success Through PMA. What else could Napolean tell me?<br />This book is more like having Napolean Hill as your personal coach. It is like a written workshop with exercises and self analysis techniques. Hill also takes each of the 17 principles, dissects them and explains them in more detail than in Think &amp; Grow Rich.<br />I always tell people that if you are going to buy just one Napolean Hill book, make it Think &amp; Grow Rich. But if you are like me, if you like to feed your mind with good mental protein, then I would add this one on as well. It complements Think &amp; Grow Rich.<br />For the price of a meal you can create the mental attitude of a champion. Well worth the price.	2004-06-16
