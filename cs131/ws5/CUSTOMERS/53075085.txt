Most of the book consists of stories of porn users expressing their opinions about how they have been affected by porn. Some seem to think porn is harmless fun, some think it takes up too much time or makes real sex less exciting, and some think causes disagreements between a man and woman. It's clear that some couples disagree over porn and that disagreement harms their relationship. But that's hardly worth writing a book about. The rest of the opinions her subjects express don't seem informed enough to provide any general rules about who benefits or is harmed by porn.<br /><br /> She claims people tend to confuse porn with reality, but the evidence for this theory consists of answers people give to abstract questions asked by researchers where the incentives to distinguish fantasy from reality are weak. Her belief that this tells us something disturbing about how porn affects relationships appears to say more about her biases than anything else.<br /><br /> She has only one piece of possibly rigorous scientific research to use against porn - the Zillmann-Bryant experiments. This evidence raises some concerns that porn causes people to be less willing to punish rapists. How disturbing this is depends on guesses about whether people are otherwise biased toward excessive punishment and how much answers to hypothetical questions tell us about behavior of voters/jurors. I'm disappointed that she didn't pay more attention to this issue.	2005-10-07

But he is a bit long-winded, and tries to hedge his methodology by pointing to specific research results which he seems to think buttress his conclusions. He neither convinces me that he is good at distinguishing hype from value when analyzing current projects, nor that doing so would help with the longer-term forecasting that constitutes the important aspect of the book.<br /><br />Given the title, I was slightly surprised that he predicts that AIs will become powerful slightly more gradually than I recall him suggesting previously (which is a good deal more gradual than most Singulitarians). He offsets this by predicting more dramatic changes in the 22nd century than I imagined could be extrapolated from existing trends.<br /><br />His discussion of the practical importance of reversible computing is clearer than anything else I've read on this subject.<br /><br />When he gets specific, large parts of what he says seem almost right, but there are quite a few details that are misleading enough that I want to quibble with them.<br /><br />For instance (talking about the world circa 2030): \\"The bulk of the additional energy needed is likely to come from new nanoscale solar, wind, and geothermal technologies.\\" Yet he says little to justify this, and most of what I know suggests that wind and geothermal have little hope of satisfying more than 1 or 2 percent of new energy demand.<br /><br />His reference to \\"the devastating effect that illegal file sharing has had on the music-recording industry\\" seems to say something undesirable about his perspective.<br /><br />His comments on economists thoughts about deflation are confused and irrelevant.<br /><br />On page 92 he says \\"Is the problem that we are not running the evolutionary algorithms long enough? ... This won't work, however, because conventional genetic algorithms reach an asymptote in their level of performance, so running them for a longer period of time won't help.\\" If \\"conventional\\" excludes genetic programming, then maybe his claim is plausible. But genetic programming originator John Koza claims his results keep improving when he uses more computing power.<br /><br />His description of nanotech progress seems naive. (page 228) \\"Drexler's dissertation ... laid out the foundation and provided the road map still being followed today.\\" (page 234): \\"each aspect of Drexler's conceptual designs has been validated\\". I've been following this area pretty carefully, and I'm aware of some computer simulations which do a tiny fraction of what is needed, but if any lab research is being done that could be considered to follow Drexler's road map, it's a well kept secret. Kurzweil then offsets his lack of documentation for those claims by going overboard about documenting his accurate claim that \\"no serious flaw in Drexler's nanoassembler concept has been described\\".<br /><br />Kurzweil argues that self-replicating nanobots will sometimes be desirable. I find this poorly thought out. His reasons for wanting them could be satisfied by nanobots that replicate under the control of a responsible AI.<br /><br />I'm bothered by his complacent attitude toward the risks of AI. He sometimes hints that he is concerned, but his suggestions for dealing with the risks don't indicate that he has given much thought to the subject. He has a footnote that mentions Yudkowsky's Guidelines on Friendly AI. The context could lead readers to think they are comparable to the Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology. Alas, Yudkowsky's guidelines depend on concepts which are hard enough to understand that few researchers are likely to comprehend them, and the few who have tried disagree about their importance.work, however, because conventional genetic algorithms reach an asymptote in their level of performance, so running them for a longer period of time won't help.\\" If \\"conventional\\" excludes genetic programming, then maybe his claim is plausible.

I know a fair amount U.S. economic history, but was surprised to find many good insights that I wasn't aware of, e.g. the effect of autos on the need for farmland (much of it had been used for horse fodder).<br /><br />His understanding of economics is good compared to typical historians, but mediocre by the standards of economists. His erratic biases are generally not hard to see through. His worship of central banks is rather annoying.<br /><br />His attitudes toward wage and price controls are bizarre. On page 371 he says \\"political pressure brought wage and price controls to a premature end in 1946. The result was a roaring inflation\\". He later gives a competent description of why wage and price controls are bad when describing Nixon's imposition of them. Then a page later he seems to imply that the long gas lines in the U.S. were caused by Arab refusal to ship oil to the U.S. rather than by price controls.<br /><br />His claim that Hoover and Roosevelt differed little in their proposed policies might have been true during the 1932 election, but he overlooks an important policy difference that became clear before Roosevelt was inaugurated which had at least as much affect on the 1933 banking crisis as any cause that Gordon hints at - Hoover remained committed to the gold standard, but Roosevelt's advisers hinted at a devaluation of the dollar relative to gold. Given a monetary system under which bank deposits would get devalued in that case, but deposits withdrawn as gold coin would not get devalued, it's clear why the impending inauguration triggered a strong motive to withdraw deposits.	2005-09-03

The characters are interesting, but not as nearly distinctive as the author can manage when he's at his best. The alien isn't as alien as it first appears.<br /><br />It would have seemed quite believable back in 1971, but today the cold war mindset seems a bit outdated. The technological extrapolations are cautious enough to avoid anything embarrassing. He goes partway toward predicting the world wide web, but describes something that sounds like what we would have if the phone company maintained a monopoly on new information services.	2005-08-29

It isn't as thoughtful as Drexler's Engines of Creation, but it has many ideas that seem new to this reader who has been reading similar essays for many years, such as a solar energy collector that looks and feels like grass.<br /><br />The book is somewhat eccentric in it's choice of what to emphasize, devoting three pages to the history of the steam engine, but describing the efficiency of nanotech batteries in a footnote that is a bit too cryptic to be convincing.<br /><br />The chapter on economics is better than I expected, but I'm still not satisfied. The prediction that interest rates will be much higher sounds correct for the period in which we transition to widespread use of general purpose assemblers, since investing capital in producing more machines will be very productive. But once the technology is widespread and mature, the value of additional manufacturing will decline rapidly to the point where it ceases to put upward pressure on interest rates.<br /><br />The chapter on AI is disappointing, implying that the main risks of AI are to the human ego. For some better clues about the risks of AI, see Yudkowsky's essay on Creating Friendly AI.	2005-07-29

Their answers are interesting but not always as rigorous as I hoped.<br /><br />The implication that this is an economics book is a bit misleading. While it is occasionally guided by the principle that incentives matter, it is at least as much about Kelvinism (the belief that we ought to quantify knowledge whenever possible), but then some of the book consists of stories which have little to do with either.<br /><br />My favorite parts of the book explore the extent to which experts' incentives cause them to pursue goals that don't coincide with their clients' interests. But his arguments about realtors exaggerate the extent of their conflict of interest - it is likely that part of the reason they are quick to sell a client's house more cheaply than they would sell their own is that the realtor is less likely to need to sell by a deadline.<br /><br />I am left puzzled by the claim that crack gang leaders want to avoid gang wars, but gang members are rewarded for starting violence with promotions. Who's controlling the rewards if it isn't the leader? Why can't he ensure that members who engage in nondefensive violence aren't promoted?	2005-07-22

But when dealing with serious scientific literature, his attempts to find clearcut enemies seem mistaken.<br /><br /> Pinker's claim that \\"The second scientific defense of the Blank Slate comes from connectionism\\" is pretty puzzling. This \\"defense\\" consists of modeling the mind as \\"a general-purpose learning device\\". But the books that Pinker references (Rethinking Innateness, and Parallel Distributed Processing), are both careful to point out why their models are completely consistent with the kind of genetic influences on behavior that evolutionary psychologists are talking about. Their disagreements with Pinker seem to be at most about how those influences are implemented, and even there I can't find anything in Pinker's arguments that clearly rejects what the connectionists believe.<br /><br /> Pinker's attacks on Gould's quasi-defense of the blank slate mainly convinced me that Gould didn't want to think clearly about the subject, probably because he considered that any mechanistic explanation of the mind (genetic or environmental) was demeaning.<br /><br /> Pinker's arguments that it's silly to believe in the tabula rasa and noble savage world-views are eloquent and compelling, but his response to the \\"it's demeaning\\" attitudes will convince fewer people, because he ignores the very real benefits of holding an unrealistically high opinion of one's self (overestimating one's abilities seems to be an effective means of advertising one's strengths). To those who want to portray themselves as angelic or as wiser than software of the future, an accurate model of the mind is genuinely demeaning.<br /><br /> Pinker seems somewhat inconsistent about how important it is to know whether the mind is a blank slate.<br /><br /> On pages x - xi he says \\"the conviction that humanity could be reshaped by massive social engineering projects led to some of the greatest atrocities in history.\\" But in the chapter on fear of inequality, he claims (more convincingly), while defending his views from the charge they will encourage Nazism, that the differences between Nazi beliefs in genetic superiority and the blank slate viewpoints of Stalin and the Khmer Rouge didn't have much effect on whether those tyrannies engaged in genocide - it was the greater tendency to divide people into in-groups and out-groups that best distinguishes the worst of the genocidal tyrants.<br /><br /> Pinker exaggerates the importance of finding the correct answer to the nature-nurture debate in other ways as well (I suppose we shouldn't be surprised that an author overestimates the importance of what he's selling).<br /><br /> He gives examples such as forcing people to live in drab cement boxes (as if their taste for a more natural surrounding could be reversed by social engineers), or releasing psychopaths (because societal problems caused their insanity).<br /><br /> But a genetic component to these behaviors doesn't prove that they can't be altered (I have genes for brown hair - does that mean I can't dye my hair blue?). It only gives hints as to why they might be difficult to alter.<br /><br /> It sure looks like careful scientific studies of whether we knew how to alter these behaviors would be a more reliable way of debunking the faulty conclusions.fear of inequality, he claims (more convincingly), while defending his views from the charge they will encourage Nazism, that the differences between Nazi beliefs in genetic superiority and the blank slate viewpoints of Stalin and the Khmer Rouge didn't have much effect on whether those tyrannies engaged in genocide - it was the greater tendency to divide people into in-groups and out-groups that best distinguishes the worst of the genocidal tyrants. <br /> Pinker exaggerates the importance of finding the correct answer to the nature-nurture debate in other ways as well (I suppose we shouldn't be surprised that an author overestimates the importance of what he's selling). <br /> He gives examples such as forcing people to live in drab cement boxes (as if their taste for a more natural surrounding could be reversed by social engineers), or releasing psychopaths (because societal problems caused their insanity). <br /> But a genetic component to these behaviors doesn't prove that they can't be altered (I have genes for brown hair - does that mean I can't dye my hair blue?).

But that process also explains much about the quality of this book. It is often obvious that this book started out as a set of powerpoint presentations designed to appeal to someone high up in the pentagon who couldn't be expected to have time to consider more thorough arguments.<br /><br /> For starters, his map has nice simple curves surrounding the \\"disconnected gap\\" that make for easy viewing. It is surprising how untroubled he seems by the fact that this results in North Korea and Mongolia being included in the \\"functioning core\\" but Israel and Thailand being included in the \\"disconnected gap\\". His attempts to reassure developed countries that they aren't in danger of pre-emptive U.S. attack because they deserve to be treated under different rules than disconnected regions would be a bit more convincing if he carefully described unambiguous rules to distinguish the disconnected countries that it's ok to invade.<br /><br /> His optimism about U.S. competence at nationbuilding would sound more plausible if he showed some signs of understanding why people resist it. His claim that people such as bin Laden \\"do not promise any future whatsoever\\" suggests that he prefers to tell people what they want to hear rather than relay the apparently informed reports that bin Laden is respected because he promises a more moral future where people will be rewarded in the afterlife for obeying the Koran.<br /><br /> Another example of this pattern is when he derides various \\"duck and cover\\" style responses to terrorism, he includes something described as \\"a betting parlor for predicting terrorist strikes\\", a phrasing that suggests he got his info from an uninformed headline (the actual proposal was to predict levels of terrorism over broad periods of time given several different policies; a few critics implied that it was trying to predict individual attacks).<br /><br /> But despite all the problems I find in this book, it is a good deal more coherent and visionary than most discussions of U.S. foreign policy, and political debate might be improved a good deal if people attacked or defended this book's vision rather than trying to debate something as confusing as Bush's vision.fo from an uninformed headline (the actual proposal was to predict levels of terrorism over broad periods of time given several different policies; a few critics implied that it was trying to predict individual attacks). <br /> But despite all the problems I find in this book, it is a good deal more coherent and visionary than most discussions of U.S. foreign policy, and political debate might be improved a good deal if people attacked or defended this book's vision rather than trying to debate something as confusing as Bush's vision.	2005-06-22

The story is enjoyable except when reporting the ugly side of academic and corporate politics. The extent to which he claims that researchers who have based careers on the failed approach to smell refuse to think about the vibrational theory seems rather extreme. Yet I can only find one instance in which Burr unfairly criticizes one of those researchers (on page 233, when he says it's strange not to know what \\"the same vibration\\" means, and implies that \\"same\\" simply means an identical integer number of nanometers. Yet it would be strange if vibrations had an integer number of an arbitrary unit such as nanometers, and on page 64 Burr implies that vibrating at 2550 nanometers is the same as 2500 nanometers).<br /><br />One other incidental comment the book makes about the peer review process is worth repeating. One of the reasons that big name research labs continue producing good results is that they have an advantage comparable to insider trading as a result of seeing papers at the peer review stage, while the average lab has to wait longer to get the same ideas.	2005-06-10

It's less technical than I would like, but probably provides good enough references to enable the serious reader to find the more rigorous arguments that lead to these summaries.<br /><br />In spite of the \\"Infinite Lifespans\\" in the subtitle, the book makes little attempt to ask whether we can avoid problems such as war, the heat death of the universe, etc.<br /><br />The book is well organized for a collection of articles by 18 different authors.<br /><br />The quality of the book goes downhill near the middle about where it switches to philosophical questions. Most of the arguments against really long lifespans that it attempts to refute are too superficial to deserve more than a few pages of rebuttal. I wish I had a quick way of determining whether there are better objections to long lifespans that the book failed to deal with.<br /><br />Some specific complaints:<br /><br />Max More correctly points out that people who use population concerns as a rationalization have given little thought to the relative importance of birth rates. But his claim that lifespan has no effect on population growth is almost as thoughtless. For birthrates less than 2 per couple, the difference between a fixed lifespan and an infinite lifespan is the difference between exponential decline and exponential growth. Whatever we assume about lifespans, achieving desirable and sustainable population growth rates seems like a nontrivial problem.<br /><br />Marvin Minsky says \\"There is no sign that we are getting smarter\\" over the past two thousand years. If the Flynn Effect isn't such a sign, it's hard to imagine what would be needed to qualify as a sign. (His chapter was written in 1994, so it may just be more out of date than the rest of the book).	2005-05-26

It provides a clear understanding of why it matters how well accounting rules treat intangible assets, and gives some good guidelines on how to improve them.<br /><br />Some of the proposed improvements are fairly easy to evaluate, such as breaking down R&D into subcategories for basic research, improvements to recently released products, etc., but with some of the book's suggestions (e.g. trademarks) I'm puzzled as to whether there's little to be gained or whether he has a good idea that he hasn't adequately explained.<br /><br />Alas, accounting standards are a public good that few people have an incentive to create. The improvements suggested by the book could generally be adopted without first being approved by a standards committee because they mostly involve adding new information to reports. But the first company to adopt them gains little until investors can compare the information with that from other companies. And accounting standards committees tend to attract people whose main concern is preventing harm rather than creating new value. And that tendency is currently being reinforced by investors who want a scapegoat for their complacency at the peak of the recent stock market bubble.	2005-05-19

There's too little detail to help the reader guess whether the system is subject to inflation, whether it enables charismatic demagogues to grab more power than under our current system, etc.<br /><br />A more realistic way of evaluating reputation systems would be to look at the attempts we have today, such as the one used to allocate money for academic research, or the one used by Ebay.

If you want to know how to make slaughterhouses more humane or why a mutt is likely to behave more nicely than a purebred dog, you will like parts of this book.<br /><br />But much of the book strays beyond the author's area of expertise, and makes many confident assertions that sound suspicious or wrong.<br /><br />For instance, from page 211: \\"All intensely emotional learning is permanent. ... no one born before 1958 is ever going to forget where they were when Kennedy was shot\\". Yet well-known research by Ulric Neisser and others says those memories are wildly inaccurate.<br /><br />Another example from page 17: \\"But other times thinking in pictures is an advantage. During the 1990s I knew all the dot-coms would go to hell, because when I thought about them the only images I saw were rented office space and computers that would be obsolete in two years.

He argues that the technology is at roughly the stage that computing was when minicomputers were the leading edge, is good enough to tell us something about how full-fledged assemblers as envisioned by Drexler will be used, and that the main obstacle to people using it to build what they want is ignorance of what can be accomplished.<br /><br />The book presents interesting examples of people building things that most would assume were beyond their ability. But he does not do a good job of explaining what can and can't be accomplished. Too much of the book sounds like a fund-raising appeal for a charity, describing a needy person who was helped rather than focusing on the technology or design process. He is rather thoughtless about choosing what technical details to provide, giving examples of assembly language (something widely known, and hard enough to use that most of his target users will be deterred from making designs which need it), but when he describes novel ideas such as \\"printing\\" a kit that can be assembled into a house he is too cryptic for me to guess whether that method would improve on standard methods.<br /><br />I've tried thinking of things I might want to build, and I'm usually no closer to guessing whether it's feasible than before I read the book. For example, it would be nice if I could make a prototype of a seastead several feet in diameter, but none of the examples the book gives appear to involve methods which could make sturdy cylinders or hemispheres that large.<br /><br />The index leaves much to be desired - minicomputers are indexed under computers, and open source is indexed under software, when I expected to find them under m and o.<br /><br />And despite the lip service he pays to open source software, the CAM software he wrote comes with a vague license that doesn't meet the standard definition of open source.	2005-04-22

I suspect it isn't exactly right, but it explains a good deal more than any alternative I've seen.<br /><br />One warning - this isn't very valuable as a self-help book.

It outlines a fairly simple set of general purpose rules that may describe some important aspects of how small groups of neurons interact to produce intelligent behavior. It provides a better theory of the role of the hippocampus than I've seen before.<br /><br />I wouldn't call this book a major breakthrough, but I expect that it will produce some nontrivial advances in the understanding of the human brain.<br /><br />The most disturbing part of this book is the section on the risks of AI. He claims that AIs will just be tools, but he shows no sign of having given thought to any of the issues involved beyond deciding that an AI is unlikely to have human motives. But that leaves a wide variety of other possible goals systems, many of which would be as dangerous. It's possible that he sees easy ways to ensure that an AI is always obedient, but there are many approaches to AI for which I don't think this is possible (for instance, evolutionary programming looks like it would select for something resembling a survival instinct), and this book doesn't clarify what goals Hawkins' approach is likely to build into his software. It is easy to imagine that he would need to build in goals other than obedience in order to get his system to do any learning. If this is any indication of the care he is taking to ensure that his \\"tools\\" are safe, I hope he fails to produce intelligent software.	2005-04-01

He occasionally slips in some valuable tidbits, such as that Texas once had an oil cartel.<br /><br />He does a mediocre job of analyzing the consequences of scarcer oil. He provides a few hints of how natural gas could replace oil, but says much less about the costs of switching than I'd hoped for. His comments on how to protect yourself are misleading:<br /><br />\\"In the past, a useful way of insuring major producers and consumers against the effect of a price changes was purchasing futures contracts. However, the ordinary futures contracts extend for a year or two. The oil problem extends for 10 years or more. The oil problem extends for 10 years or more. Anyone who agrees to supply oil 10 years from now, for a price agreed on today, very likely will disappear into bankruptcy before the contract matures.\\"<br /><br />At the time the book was first published (2001), crude oil futures contracts extended about 7 years out. They weren't liquid enough to hedge a large fraction of consumption, but if a desire to hedge had caused them to say in 2001 that crude would be at $60/barrel in 2008 rather than saying it would be in the low twenties, that would both have signaled a need to react and reduced the risks of doing so. The idea that bankruptcy would threaten such futures reflects his ignorance of the futures markets. An oil producer who sold futures as a hedge will almost certainly not sell more futures than it has oil to deliver on. Speculators might lose their shirts, but futures brokers have the experience needed to ensure that the defaults are small enough for the brokers to absorb (see, for example, what happened in the gold mania of the late 70s).mania of the late 70s).	2005-03-01

For instance, he says \\"The World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which exercise wide-ranging influence over the lives of billions of people in developing nations, clearly work for the interests of the developed nations.\\" I say that they work for a much narrower set of interests, and are probably somewhat harmful to developed nations as a whole.	2005-02-28

By this book's description of the CIA, this implies it has a lot of details right but misses many important broad trends. The book tends to have weaknesses of this nature, being better as a history of Al Qaeda's conflict with the U.S. than as a guide to the future, but it's probably a good deal more reliable than CIA analysis.<br /><br />It describes a few important trends that I wasn't aware of. The best theory the book proposes that I hadn't heard before is the claim that the U.S. government is much more worried about Al Qaeda getting a nuclear bomb than the public realizes (for instance, the Axis of Evil is the set of nations that are unable or unwilling to prove they won't help Al Qaeda get the bomb).<br /><br />The explanation of the U.S. motives for invading Iraq as primarily to pressure the Saudi government is unconvincing.<br /><br />The book's biases are sufficiently subtle that I have some difficulty detecting them. It often paints Bush in as favorable a light as possible, but is also filled with some harsh criticisms of his mistakes, for example:<br /><br />\\"It is an extraordinary fact that in the U.S.-jihadist war, the only senior commander or responsible civilian to have been effectively relieved was Eric Shinseki, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, who was retired unceremoniously (although not ahead of schedule) after he accurately stated that more than 200,000 troops would be needed in Iraq\\"<br /><br />But it's hard to place a lot of confidence in theories that are backed mainly by eloquent stories. It's unfortunate that the book is unable or unwilling to document the evidence needed to confirm them.	2005-02-22

Many of his claims don't seem to be disputed anywhere, but his claim that \\"we need worry little about the threat of an offensive and expansionist jihad\\" seems pretty inconsistent with what I read elsewhere about Al Qaeda's interest in recreating a Caliphate which could call such a jihad and the book's not-too-convincing claim that Al Qaeda is winning.<br /><br />He says the only option is to crush the enemy with the way Lincoln defeated the south. But he doesn't present any clear explanation of why the U.S. shouldn't give in to most of bin Laden's demands. It wouldn't be as easy as admitting defeat in Vietnam was (in addition to getting out of the Mideast, it would involve cutting all aid to Israel, and convincing Muslims that we aren't supporting the Saudi government, etc.), but his worldview implies that would undercut Muslim desires to engage in suicidal attacks on the U.S.<br /><br />He asks many of the questions that would need to considered in deciding whether such a withdrawal is better than escalating violence, but avoids any direct consideration of such a withdrawal. And in spite of his frequent complaints about people who meddle in Afghanistan while repeating the mistakes that the Soviets and British made there, he doesn't present much of an argument that more ruthless policies would be sufficient to produce victory.ions that would need to considered in deciding whether such a withdrawal is better than escalating violence, but avoids any direct consideration of such a withdrawal.

Two minor weaknesses in the paper: it ought to explain why this is a better use of money than funding research directly (I expect this could be done by analyzing the incentives and track record of small startup drug companies versus nonprofit/government researchers). The joint randomization for substitutes works well if there's unlimited money to buy patents, but if a patentholder can make joint patents too expensive to buy by falsely claiming that its patent is a substitute, then it's hard to analyze whether problems result (although I'm fairly sure they could be dealt with).<br /><br /> The chapter on decision markets (aka idea futures) provides some hints on how many of the problems with democracy could be fixed. Hopefully this will encourage readers to seek out his more thorough argument (search for Futarchy to find it).<br /><br /> The time-consistent health insurance proposal describes a good free-market alternative solution to many of the problems that government-run insurance proposals claim to address.<br /><br /> The chapter on gene insurance would address additional problems with people born with genes that scare insurers, but only if it were possible to require buying this insurance prior before an infants genes get tested for defects. But it's unclear how such a requirement can be enforced - it seems possible that a mother will often be able to get a fetus tested secretly before the government realizes it's time for the child to get insured.<br /><br /> The section on organ shortages provides some interesting arguments that the medical establishment profits from the shortage of organs created by laws against the sale of organs.<br /><br /> The chapter on securities regulation is too longwinded but contains good evidence that competition between securities regulators will help investors.dence that competition between securities regulators will help investors.	2005-01-23

He provides a rather thorough and unbiased summary of civilization-threatening risks, and a good set of references to the relevant literature.<br /><br /> I am disappointed that he gave little attention to the risks of AI. Probably his reason is that his expertise in law and economics will do little to address what is more of an engineering problem that is unlikely to be solved by better laws.<br /><br /> I suspect he's overly concerned about biodiversity loss. He tries to justify his concern by noting risks to our food chain that seem to depend on our food supply being less diverse than it is.<br /><br /> His solutions do little to fix the bad incentives which have prevented adequate preparations. The closest he comes to fixing them is his proposal for a center for catastrophic-risk assessment and response, which would presumably have some incentive to convince people of risks in order to justify its existence.<br /><br /> His criticisms of information markets (aka idea futures) ignore the best arguments on this subject. He attacks the straw man of using them to predict particular terrorist attacks, and ignores possibilities such as using them to predict whether invading Iraq would reduce or increase deaths due to terrorism over many years. And his claim that scientists need no monetary incentives naively ignores their bias to dismiss concerns about harm resulting from their research (bias which he notes elsewhere as a cause of recklessness).<br /><br /> His ambivalent comments about a science court convinced me that his version (and most others) would be too biased toward policies which serve the interests of scientific researchers. He claims that the most similar existing court has \\"not yielded convincing evidence that it is doing a better job with patent cases than the generalist federal appeals courts did\\", but Jaffe and Lerner's book Innovation and Its Discontents provides strong evidence that replacing generalist courts with a court devoted to patent appeals has caused disastrous special interest group domination of the U.S. patent system.<br /><br /> I doubt new courts are needed. Instead, existing courts should adopt rules that measure reputations of peer-reviewed papers to resolve scientific disputes (e.g. how often they're cited, and the reputation of the journal in which they're published). Also, expanding use of idea futures markets should prod whatever institutions that judge those contracts to address an increasing number of disputes that courts or court-like institutions deal with.<br /><br /> I have a number a smaller complaints:<br /><br /> He doesn't prove his claim that if the uncertainty about global warming is greater than Kyoto-supporters admit then their case is stronger. That would be true it were just a disagreement over the standard deviation of a temperature forecast, but an uncertainty over which model to use might say something else if Kyoto-supporters are biased to ignore models which predict stable temperatures.<br /><br />  He claims on page 22 \\"No one knows why the 1918-1919 [flu] pandemic was so lethal\\", but then indicates some awareness of Ewald's fairly compelling argument that the causes are understood, and avoiding a repetition of this disaster is simply a matter of spreading the right knowledge.<br /><br /> He claims on page 117 that \\"primitive nanotech assemblers have been built, as we saw in chapter 1\\", yet I can't find anything in chapter 1 that indicates what this apparently false claim refers to.<br /><br /> He does a poor job of dealing with arguments against giving international agencies more power. He seems to think concern over sovereignty is based primarily on issues of relative power of nations. One effect that he ignores is that having many small governments allowspeople to choose between competing ones, but a single central government has the problems associated with monopoly power.<br /><br /> He underestimates the value of absolutist strategies for preserving civil rights (he prefers a case-by-case analysis) because he reasons as if people could be perfectly rational. If instead he realized that people have at best bounded rationality, he would realize that slippery slope arguments provide some support for an absolutist strategy. Also, he seems to underestimate the extent to which governments restrict liberty to enhance their own power rather than to fight evil.single central government has the problems associated with monopoly power. <br /> He underestimates the value of absolutist strategies for preserving civil rights (he prefers a case-by-case analysis) because he reasons as if people could be perfectly rational.

It does a decent job of answering the rather narrow question it asks - it shows that entrepreneurs aren't advocating much reform.

It also has large sections of what seem like pieces of an ordinary introductory econ textbook, which will be tedious to anyone who has taken an econ course without being terribly valuable to those who haven't. The book appears fairly thorough and objective, but not very imaginative or insightful.<br /><br />One point he makes that I found worth remembering is to point out the similarities between Chinese state ownership of enterprises with U.S. University ownership of companies created to commercialize their research. In both cases the owning institution has a mission very different from commerce, but often allows the enterprise to function as a business. Alas, he doesn't explore the incentive structures that make this often work in China but create monopoly-style inefficiencies when most other governments own businesses.	2005-01-13

He convinced me that it will be less sudden than I previously thought, by convincing me that truly general-purpose learning machines won't work, and that much of intelligence involves using large quantities of data about the real world to choose good biases with which to guide our learning.	2004-12-17

It suggests that Fukuyama's claim that \\"there is a relatively low degree of trust in Chinese society the moment one steps outside the family circle\\" is misleading because the Chinese notions of family ties aren't as rigid as in the west. Family-style trust is more like a commodity that can be readily acquired by most people who have decent reputations, via friend of a friend type connections between people. And the networks of reputation do well at ensuring the reasonableness of corrupt or arbitrary actors.<br /><br /> It would be nice if we could copy the good parts of these aspects of Chinese culture, but I suspect that's as hard as copying the social capital that Fukuyama describes in his book Trust.	2004-12-15

It will be more effective at convincing the average person than most other attempts have been, both because of its style and because it shows that the changes which broke the system shouldn't have been expected to help anyone other than patent lawyers. Their analysis will be useful in helping to avoid the takeover of other agencies by special interests.<br /><br />Their description of how the system should be fixed is less impressive. Their summary of proposed changes strangely fails to include undoing the change in appeals court jurisdiction which they suggest was a primary cause of the problems. Their argument in favor of patenting software, business practices, etc. is more radical than they seem to realize, as it appears to imply that patents should also be extended to mathematical theorems, yet they act as if the burden of proof should be on their critics.<br /><br />Their confidence that a traditional patent system is better than no patents is unconvincing (but they do a good job of explaining why it is hard to know what the best system is). They support their position by a few examples such as Xerox, whose copier wouldn't have been invented as it was without patent protection. But it's much harder than they imply to determine that a copier wouldn't have been invented some other way a few years later.	2004-12-10

The \\"enigma\\" of the Cambrian explosion seems to have been explained by Andrew Parker (see his book In the Blink of an Eye) in a way that undercuts Rare Earth's use of it (dramatic changes of this nature seem very likely when eyes first evolve). This theory was apparently first published in a technical journal in 1998 (i.e. before Rare Earth).<br /><br />They often assume that intelligence could only develop as it has in humans, even suggesting that it couldn't evolve in the ocean, which is rather odd given how close the octopus is to qualifying. But the various arguments in the book are independent enough that the weak parts don't have much affect on the rest of the arguments.<br /><br />I was surprised that they never mentioned the Fermi Paradox, which I consider to be the strongest single argument for their position. Apparently they don't give it much thought because they don't expect technological growth to produce effects that encompass more than our planet and are visible at galactic distances.<br /><br />Their concern over biodiversity seems rather misplaced. I can understand why people who overestimate mother nature's benevolence think that preserving the status quo is a safe strategy for humanity, but it seems to me that anyone sharing Rare Earth's belief that nature could wipe us out any time now should tend to prefer a strategy of putting more of our effort into creating technology that will allow us to survive natural disasters.<br /><br /> I am disappointed that they rarely attempt to quantify the range of probabilities they would consider reasonable for the risks they discuss.<br /><br /> Stephen Webb has written a book on roughly the same subject called Where is Everybody? that is more carefully argued, but less entertaining, than Rare Earth.ng technology that will allow us to survive natural disasters. <br /> I am disappointed that they rarely attempt to quantify the range of probabilities they would consider reasonable for the risks they discuss. <br /> Stephen Webb has written a book on roughly the same subject called Where is Everybody? that is more carefully argued, but less entertaining, than Rare Earth.	2004-11-17

But it doesn't try to analyze the effects of non-financial incentives such as the desire for a reputation for altruism.<br /><br />One of the most striking features of this book is the worldview that it criticizes. Apparently when the book was written, it was respectable to believe that special interest group politics improved democracy. This book seems to have been one of the original reasons for the shift of opinions away from that view. But from today's perspective, Olson seems a bit naive in his optimism that large governments and labor unions will serve the public interest in spite of the problems that the book describes of small interest groups with concentrated interests being more effective at lobbying than large groups with diluted interests.<br /><br />His clear reasoning on his main points is still not as widely understood as it should be.

This book makes a strong argument that we shouldn't accept that. It demonstrates that it is possible to turn intuitions about causation into hypotheses that are unambiguous and testable.<br /><br />But the style is sufficiently dense and dry we will need some additional books with more practical styles before these ideas become widely understood. The style is fairly good by the standards of books whose main goal is rigorous proof, but it's still hard work to learn a large number of new concepts that are mostly referred to by terse symbols whose meaning can't be found via a glossary or index. Pearl occasionally introduces a memorable word, such as do(x), the way a software engineer who wants readable code would, but mostly sticks to single-character symbols that seem unreasonably hard (at least for us programmers who are used to descriptive names) to remember.<br /><br />If you're uncertain whether reading this book is worth the effort, I strongly recommend reading the afterword first. It ought to have been used as the introduction, and without it many readers will be left wondering why they should believe they will be rewarded for slogging through so much dry material.	2004-09-15

I didn't learn much from it.<br /><br />He makes a good case that some of the features of autism are more typical of the male brain than of the female brain. But he doesn't convince me that this has much significance. I am bothered that he refers to autism as extreme maleness, when there appear to be a number features on which extreme maleness and degree of autism have little correlation (e.g. risk tolerance).<br /><br /> The AQ test that he includes at the end looks like it leaves plenty of room for improvement (for instance, I'm annoyed that it offers four choices for each response, but scores the results as if there were only two choices), but it still seems to be the best readily available test of its kind.	2004-09-02

Books	3	1	1	N	N	A few good essays amid a lot of mediocrity	Too much of this book is devoted to relatively unoriginal ideas that reflect little more information about China than can be found in a typical U.S. newspaper, and which provide little insight into the future of China. Many of the chapters say little more than that freedom is good, especially free trade. Those arguments have been made better elsewhere. Chapter 12 is much worse, criticizing free trade based on national security concerns of doubtful honesty. For instance, the concern over export of encryption ignores the widespread availability of free software fully capable of performing the encryption in question on internet sires in numerous countries. Anyone following the debates over regulating encryption at the time this book was written would have known that export controls would do little to keep encryption from anyone with a serious desire for it.<br /><br />The one chapter that really provided the kind of information and analysis that I hoped for was chapter 17, which analyzed the extent to which China has been adopting democracy and the rule of law, and provides some hints as to why those changes have been happening.<br /><br />The book also contains some moderately reassuring arguments leading me to believe that China isn't likely to start a war.<br /><br />If you read this book, I recommend avoiding part III, and probably part I and chapter 7.	2004-08-26

But I'm a bit disappointed by his half-hearted attempts to go beyond reporting the A's methods and analyze why other teams are slow to copy methods which improve scores.<br /><br />One obvious question to ask is whether team owners provide the appropriate incentives for managers to maximize the number of games won. The book hints on page 123 that the answer is no, that the A's payrolls in 2002 were further behind the those of the Yankees than in 1999. But that hint could be misleading, as it only describes an increase in the dollar difference in payrolls, and leaves unclear what happened to the ratio of the payrolls.<br /><br />One theory I came up with to explain resistance to copying the A's methods is the possibility that people view baseball as a means of measuring players skill for some broader purpose than winning games, and that winning by getting more walks seems like cheating because it doesn't reflect the abilities that baseball was designed to measure. Alas, the book provides few indications as to whether this theory explains much.<br /><br />Another theory that I suspect is more powerful is that managers who worked their way up to that job through a career as scouts adopted attitudes that implied scouting is a valuable profession, are unable to reconcile those attitudes with the new methods described in Moneyball, and prefer the worldview that says their career has been productive over a worldview which is more accurate but which implies that they have (at least at times) been ripping off their employers. Mancur Olson reported in his book Power and Prosperity that similar problems cause many private companies to categorically refuse to hire people who worked for Soviet state-run firms in the same industry.	2004-08-18

Evolutionary theory has a good enough track record at explaining things that appear at first glance to be counterproductive that people shouldn't reject it without finding an alternative with a good deal of explanatory power. But exuberance is an idea which explains very little. And anyone who has made impartial observations of typical natural ecosystems should see that the extravagance and waste that the book worships are sufficiently uncommon as to be hard to reconcile with the book's characterization.	2004-07-28

The &quot;Power as Non-Zero Sum&quot; subtitle hints at an explanation, but the book only devotes a few cryptic sentences to this subject.<br /><br /> The book's style is rather dull and plodding.	2004-07-21

It is almost detailed enough to suggest how the patterns involved could be built out of individual neurons, while providing ideas about how to create complex patterns.<br />It still isn't specific enough to create a simulation that would produce anything resembling human thought, but I can imagine that Calvin's theory will prove to be one of the bigger steps needed to create such a simulation.	2004-07-15

It's not so much that people looking at the Cambrian explosion should have seen the evidence pointing to this theory - the book tends to indicate that some important pieces of evidence were only found in the last decade or so. What puzzles me is why nobody modelled the effects of the evolution of eyesight well enough to decide to go looking for the results in the fossil record. This makes me wonder whether a lot of experts are still uncomfortable with the punctuated equilibrium model of evolution.<br />But the book's style leaves much to be desired. It often goes off on irrelevant tangents. The absence of references to scientific literature is disappointing. I'm annoyed by the way he presents numbers such as &quot;543 million years ago&quot; with little indication of how accurately they are known.	2004-07-07

I initially believed it, but then developed doubts.<br /> It would be very hard to find a clear test of the theory, but some of my suspicions are based on theories of why humans evolved intelligence. The arguments in Geoffrey Miller's The Mating Mind suggest pressures that would have caused consciousness to be used as soon as the brain developed the capacity for it. But Jaynes' theory seems to require that genes needed to support consciousness spread around the world without being used for that purpose.<br /> What I like most about the book is the way it shakes up the common assumption that we can understand the mind by a combination of introspection and casually observing people around us (i.e. by folk psychology). Jaynes doesn't do this as well as Dennett in Consciousness Explained, but he comes close.	2004-07-06

This book does a fairly lucid and impartial job of examining eight potentially controversial claims.<br />The best chapter is the one on placebos, which convinced me that my previous reasons for believing in a placebo effect were wrong, and then showed that it was still quite possible that placebo effects are real.<br />But much of the book is a good deal more forgettable. His discussion of homosexuality might strike a few rabid Lysenkoists as preposterous, but most educated people should find his answers unsurprising. And his approach isn't nearly as valuable when dealing with hotly debated topics such as global warming as it is when he is bringing overlooked controversies to our attention.	2004-07-02

Most other authors seem confused about this crisis, but Wigmore explains how the hints that Roosevelt planned to devalue the dollar, combined with a system under which bank deposits were tied to paper dollars but could be withdrawn as gold, made it safer to hold gold than to leave one's money in a bank.	2004-07-02

It portrays the normal life of an autistic person credibly, and cautiously approaches some important dilemmas about identity.<br />But what it leaves out is sometimes frustrating. The ending is a bit too cryptic. The ape research that plays an important role in the story is hardly explained at all, as if it could only be understood by experts, when it seems to me that the research must have included some observations of behavioral changes in the apes that an average person could understand and which should influence the protagonist in his difficult choice.	2004-07-01

But when discussing the effects of direct interfaces between neurons and silicon, he stops short of wondering whether that will produce people with dramatically enhanced intelligence. Nor does he seem to think that machine intelligence will have dramatic effects, at least in this century.<br />He claims to believe that technological growth tends to follow exponential curves, but the magnitude of the changes he foresees suggests he tends to expect technological progress to be closer to linear.	2004-06-30

But it's mainly valuable as a description of the differences between economists, and shouldn't be confused with a serious attempt at finding the correct answers to economic controversies.<br />The author's libertarianism sometimes overcomes his objectivity, particularly when dealing with the great depression. He credits the Austrian school with predicting the depression without noting the frequency with which their theory predicts downturns. He is rather uncritical in reporting the claim that the Fed could have expanded the money supply faster in 1931-32 without endangering the gold standard. That claim depends on the rather questionable assumption that broad measures of the money supply are all that matters. Arguments such as those in Wigmore's The Crash and Its Aftermath that make proper note of the large increase in currency in circulation seem more thoughtful.<br />He is a bit unfair to Keynes, whose main theory makes some sense if his ambiguous references to savings are interpreted as an increased desire to hold currency (which, by causing deflation, distorts real interest rates and wages). But Skousen assumes that Keynes meant savings in the broader sense of choosing to invest wealth instead of consuming it. Many of Keynes followers have interpreted Keynes' theory that way in order to rationalize using Keynes' theory as a solution to recessions that don't involve deflation - Skousen's criticisms seem fair when applied to that version of Keynesianism. And of course Keynes deserves some criticism for being unclear. I propose as a better way of expressing what Keynes was groping for is that there was a speculative bubble in currency. I.e. people bid up the value of the dollar relative to other goods, and the trend caused people to decide that currency was a good investment.	2004-06-25

It's surprising and disappointing that I can find few arguments against Gold's theories by those who reject them.<br /> The book's main weakness is that it is not as rigorous as it ought to be when attacking theories that have been widely accepted. The book usually doesn't analyze alternate theories as thoroughly as I would have liked.<br /> For example, he implies that the sudden 30 foot drop that some land experienced in the 1964 Alaska earthquake is hard for conventional theories to explain. But it would take a good deal of knowledge of both the accuracy of the reported time that drop took and of how fast a drop is consistent with conventional theories to verify this implication, and I see few signs that he has acquired such knowledge.<br /> It's also rather annoying that he exaggerates the importance of his theories to oil drilling. It's easy to imagine that sedimentary rock is the most cost-effective place to drill regardless of how much oil is in other rocks. And the claim on the back cover that he says &quot;we are not running out of petroleum&quot; is a very misleading way to summarize his theory.	2004-05-22

But it is not a very carefully written book. Much of the history that it includes seems like a tedious recitation of names and dates that are of marginal relevance to understanding financial markets.

It deals mainly with strategies appropriate to handling multi-billion dollar portfolios, but many of the ideas would apply to ordinary investors as well. But because he is mostly very cautious about what strategies to use, the advice won't be terribly surprising to experienced investors, and won't satisfy many risk-tolerant investors.<br /> The one area in which I disagree with the book is his overly confident rejection of technical analysis. While most simple versions of technical analysis have not shown impressive results, and it may well be that none work with investments of the size that Yale makes, the number of successful traders who make some use of technical analysis (for example, most of those interviewed in Jack Schwager's books) should not be dismissed lightly.	2004-03-13

It shows that many famous people were less innovative than is commonly thought, and that science is more incremental than revolutionary (but in spite of the title, it says little about Einstein).<br /> But I can't help wondering whether the book exaggerates to make the misleading histories sound more scandalous than they really were. However, I only see one sentence that seems to justify this suspicion. On page 94 (regarding the effects of the great depression on the Hawthorne studies) he says &quot;the desperation in these words seems to leap from the page&quot;. I don't see any clear signs of desperation in those words he quotes. It wouldn't surprise me if the workers were desperate, but the book fails to convince me about this.	2004-02-21

This is surprising enough to make it a pretty good book.<br /> But much of the book has little value. The lengthy questionnaires mostly just told me what I already knew about myself.<br /> He mostly ignores any questions that might be raised about whether the happiness he's helping people to find is authentic (which isn't surprising if you assume he's following his own advice). I have a strong suspicion that becoming happy from following his advice and changing one's perception about how well things are going isn't as genuinely satisfying as it would be to create the kind of successes that happiness has evolved as a reward for.<br /> Some of his claims about parental influences on children appear to have been discredited by Judith Rich Harris.
