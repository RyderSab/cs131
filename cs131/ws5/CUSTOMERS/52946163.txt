US	52946163	RRXND0CYIOYFH	0399152083	55533213	Survivor in Death	Books	4	3	3	N	N	More hardboiled and case-oriented than usual	I have read all of the books in the \\"In Death\\" series, and \\"Survivor\\" is by far the most hardboiled cop story of the bunch. Roberts also confronted head-on what she has been hinting at in the background throughout the series: Roarke wants children one day, and Eve is not ready to even think about it.<br /><br />It took some getting used to, but in the end I really liked this book. It has a distinctly different flavor from the rest. Eve was under a lot of personal pressure on this case because of Nixie Swisher, the only survivor of a mass murder of her whole family. Eve was irritable and angry, yes, but this case was very much a reminder of her own abuse-ridden past and it put her in the hot-seat because she actually had a survivor asking her \\"have you caught them yet?\\" Roberts has been writing Eve in more and more situations directly confronting her abused childhood, and this book was an excellent extension of that process.<br /><br />\\"Survivor\\" is a perfect example of the main character reacting realistically to tremendous stress and life knocking them around a bit in real situations, both personal and professional. Eve was less supercop and more human in \\"Survivor\\" and I really enjoyed the change. The main drawback is that if someone picked up \\"Survivor\\" without having read the rest of the series, they would be very surprised and possibly disappointed that the other books are a lot more blended scifi/romance/police story than just plain cop story.<br /><br />If you like the \\"In Death\\" series but have had the feeling recently that Roberts has been stuck in a rut based on the numerous characters' quirks and series conventions that \\"always\\" had to appear, then this book is going to seriously appeal to you. It really breaks the series mold and forces the characters into a new mode. I wouldn't necessarily want this \\"new mode\\" to become the order of the day, but if you take the story as a refreshing change that will put a spin on stories to come that could not have existed before, you will \\"get\\" what I believe Roberts was trying to do.<br /><br />And one final thought: I think that those who read Roberts primarily for romance stories and consider the \\"In Death\\" series to be her \\"adventure out of the genre\\" are going to be in for a rude surprise. Yes, there is some relationship stuff, but at this point Roberts is spending less time on the romance novel convention of explaining relationships in detailed exposition, and has with \\"Survivor\\" firmly settled the writing into \\"just getting on with it\\" and letting the characters tell the story. I liked it because frankly this series is very mature and I don't think that it is necessary \\"explain\\" the well-established relationship of Eve and Roarke in such detail. If you read the series, you get how these two great characters function together, and you can remember things that have happened before and let those memories inform the dialogue and interactions on the page now. Those who still prefer to have the focus soley on romance should look elsewhere, because I don't see Roberts returning to that in this series at this stage in the game. I for one say that it's about time, and I'm glad that NR decided to take the plunge. Cruise control makes for a smooth ride, but punching the gas every once in a while keeps things interesting.e existed before, you will \\"get\\" what I believe Roberts was trying to do. <br /> <br />And one final thought: I think that those who read Roberts primarily for romance stories and consider the \\"In Death\\" series to be her \\"adventure out of the genre\\" are going to be in for a rude surprise.

I was suspicious, although the *idea* of \\"The Tipping Point\\" is very interesting, that the execution would not be so engaging. Thankfully, I was wrong. The author, Malcolm Gladwell, writes clearly and without pretention. He is obviously very intelligent and writes accordingly, but doesn't have the stuffed shirt quality that so many intellectuals have.<br /><br />And best of all, his book's premise is one of the most original I've read in a very long time. He delivers the evidence that backs up what he is saying, and he makes everything clear and entertaining. He uses concrete examples that really bring home his points, even the ones that at first just don't \\"add up\\" because conventional thinking tells you the opposite must be true.<br /><br />This book is one of those rare gems that makes you truly THINK about the world around you in a whole new way. It has simple ideas about certain kinds of people and psychological truths that spread \\"epidemics\\" of change and trends that can be applied to many complex situations. It can give you insight that you never had before on baffling or \\"roadblocked\\" issues.<br /><br />School consolidation, for instance, is a huge problem in West Virginia. Instinctively, parents, teachers and students know that something \\"is wrong\\" with the whole idea of school consolidation, but they can't put their finger on just why a lot of the time. The rule of 150, which states that after a group becomes larger than 150 people it becomes increasingly impersonal, inefficient and factional, exactly explains why consolidation is a bad idea, especially for kids, whose personalities are still being formed.<br /><br />His rehash of the \\"broken window\\" theory explains why the West Side of my hometown, Charleston, is in a total nightmare of crime. We have had a tidal wave of crime, large and small, and in the last couple of years fatal shootings have been skyrocketing. Well, if you just go to the West Side and look at it, you can see that the whole section has been \\"abandoned.\\" Condemned houses, houses that should be condemned, horribly unmaintained roads, stop lights that don't work, grafitti on mailboxes -- it looks like you could do anything you wanted there and no one would say \\"boo.\\" The once beautiful section of town has become a classic case of \\"broken window\\" theory in action.<br /><br />Those are just two concrete things that I realized went from \\"HUH?\\" to explained in my own experience. I think that anyone who reads this book will recognize similar situations in their own lives that they can apply these ideas to. Even better, they might even come up with brand new solutions to \\"unsolvable\\" problems because they took a new perspective on them. Gladwell very much wants people to *apply* what he is talking about. \\"The Tipping Point\\" is designed to be a manual of sorts for rethinking problems and coming up with ways to attack them that we haven't tried before. Perhaps the right Maven, Connector or Salesman will see one of his ideas, apply it and start a positive epidemic of their own. That alone makes it worth reading.l, if you just go to the West Side and look at it, you can see that the whole section has been \\"abandoned.\\" Condemned houses, houses that should be condemned, horribly unmaintained roads, stop lights that don't work, grafitti on mailboxes -- it looks like you could do anything you wanted there and no one would say \\"boo.\\" The once beautiful section of town has become a classic case of \\"broken window\\" theory in action. <br /> <br />Those are just two concrete things that I realized went from \\"HUH?\\" to explained in my own experience.

Her concept of \\"designer writing\\" -- essentially, putting color and art back into the written word after the Gutenberg press removed them -- is proved. Most of her pages are beautiful and artful. Personal taste of course dictates whether one finds something beautiful, so not every page was to my taste, but craftsmanship was apparent throughout the book.<br /><br />The main drawback of the book is that I believe it is overwritten. Kirschenbaum often made a point over and over again, with different examples, to the point that I sometimes skipped some of the text because I felt it wasn't offering a new idea. Ironically, Kirschenbaum often tried to use words to describe what was obvious on the page about different cultures that loved colored manuscripts. I think that she could have condensed that portion of the book radically and let the manuscripts speak more for themselves and gotten her points across just as well.<br /><br />Because I am a copy editor for a newspaper, I have been trained to read as quickly as possible while still retaining the information and at the same time finding mistakes. It was very difficult for me to \\"slow down\\" at first. \\"Gutenberg\\" demanded, because of its design-heavy layouts and numerous typefaces, that the reader stop and smell the fonts. :) Once I got the hang of the speed of the book and the way Kirschenbaum presented her information, I found myself able to follow the text pretty well. My speed improved a bit, but that wasn't the point, and I made a point of really *looking* at every page. The images were chosen for a reason, and so I tried to experience the book as the author intended. I believe doing that helped me understand on a gut level what Kirschenbaum is trying to say about designer writing and the fact that black and white words are inadequate in today's world.<br /><br />I'm going to be honest. I'm always going to be one of those people that does not mind a black and white book. I *like* color, and I like images and fancy layouts, but I learned to read using black words on white paper and a lot of imagination. There is an element of control in designer writing that does not exist in black and white writing. The author (or designer, if there is a separate one) has control over the mood of the text much more, the tone of it and the rhythm of it using designer-writing. With a black and white book, the reader can find their own tone, can find their own mental picture paintings that don't depend on anything visual on the page.<br /><br />However, I also realize that this way of reading is on the way out. The one thing that Kirschenbaum absolutely has total credibility about is knowing what young readers need. Young readers need color. They need pictures and \\"fancy\\" layouts. They have grown up in a completely different media environment than I did, and I'm only 31. As technology streaks forward and radically alters daily life, I think we will find that older generations are going to have a hard time adjusting to the new ideas and methods that the next one must have to function. Publishers are in the same boat I am, and this is going to be hard for them.<br /><br />Speaking as a professional in the publishing industry, I can tell you one thing: I seriously doubt that the first successful designer-written books will come from a large publishing house. Like all other huge corporations, they do not want to risk their profits on what they consider an unproved method. They will not recognize the value of the new way of doing things until someone else makes a buck doing it. Only when someone else -- possibly an already established author with money to burn -- has tremendous success with more than one book published in color will the industry \\"wake up\\" and realize that \\"hey, there might be something to this color business after all.\\" (The Harry Potter series would be incredible in color, for instance. I would love to seethe last book done as a color work, and then for the others to be retroactively colorized.)<br /><br />I doubt that Kirschenbaum's dream of seeing a bunch of color-printed books will occur by 2015. But I imagine that within her lifetime, her prediction of a whole new way of printing and reading books will come to pass. It will be better in the long run for everyone, even if some people who are set in their ways wish to still read their books in black and white.ove to see the last book done as a color work, and then for the others to be retroactively colorized.) <br /> <br />I doubt that Kirschenbaum's dream of seeing a bunch of color-printed books will occur by 2015.

I love this book specifically because it is a total exercise in thought. It examines where we may have been, where we know we've been, where we are and where we *could* go in human society.<br />The book for the most part serves as an indictment of patriarchal society, and like any good manifesto, it tells why the proposed system is better. Unlike a manifesto, however, it doesn't get bogged down in the minutia and instead retains its philosophical focus. Yes, there are practical suggestions, but they are a side benefit to the overall thinking process going on.<br />The group therapy part is the comments from &quot;modern women&quot; at the end of each chapter. They are all different shades of thought on the same subject, and no they don't all agree with each other.<br />The other concept indicted is Christianity, and to some extent the other two religions that stem from the same root, Judaism and Islam. It is a very good, very thorough indictment of the many fallacies and inconsistencies in Christian thought, action and doctrine.<br />Unlike Ronald L. Russell, who did not believe that the author was advocating atheism in any way, I believe that in a way Ms. Walker was in fact advocating a thealogy that is so radically different in its application and in how its followers view it that in a way it is atheism as we define it today. Rather than encouraging people to believe in a literal Goddess, she encourages people to view Her as a metaphor or a work of art that we use to recreate our society ourselves. She also emphatically encourages scientific discovery and thought, and criticizes irrationalism, epecially as it pertains to religion, many times.<br />Ms. Walker recognizes the emotional needs that humans have concerning religion. She proposes that a Goddess system, which is about celebrating the truth of the cycles of our lives and the importance that women actually have in the biological and social structures of our species, would work better than the patriarchal &quot;zero-sum game&quot; that we are all living through now.<br />In a very real way, Ms. Walker is proposing that we redefine what religion is, based on a more knowing, scientific and adult viewpoint than our forebears were capable of thousands of years ago. She theorizes -- and I think that she is right -- that if our mythology and the images, stories and art that we surround ourselves with reflect a more mature thinking process, a more rational thinking process, that in turn our societies will mature beyond their current state of near-constant crisis and inequality.ve in the biological and social structures of our species, would work better than the patriarchal &quot;zero-sum game&quot; that we are all living through now.<br />In a very real way, Ms. Walker is proposing that we redefine what religion is, based on a more knowing, scientific and adult viewpoint than our forebears were capable of thousands of years ago.

This is clearly illustrated in Holy Blood, Holy Grail, which chronicles the attempts of two researchers working in France to find out just what is up with the Holy Grail, the Templars, and the Church. Their journey is complicated and strange -- and a lot more than the reader or the researchers themselves bargained for.<br />Even if you don't agree with their conclusions, you have to admit that the source material points in the direction of the Holy Grail being exactly what they say it is. It also points to the Priory of Sion and the Templars being intricately connected to the whole story.<br />I became interested in Holy Blood, Holy Grail after reading The Da Vinci Code, and I must say that Brown closely follows the information in this work. If you wanted to know &quot;what was true&quot; about The Da Vinci Code, this book will clarify it for you.<br />I would say the most unfortuntate thing about the whole book is that if even just half of it is true, there are a lot of things about religous history as we know it that are either wrong or &quot;written by the winners.&quot;	2003-11-25

She was absolutely right.<br />If you like thrillers but aren't into alternative religious studies, you will still like this book. &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; is so strong as an adventure story, you don't have to be into any of the main characters' favorite subjects to enjoy it.<br />It does help, however, to be interested by the mental twists and turns of the conspiracy theories, obscure history and anti-establishment viewpoints expressed here. It also helps to have a good vocabulary or a good dictionary -- the main characters are all academics, and they speak and think as such.<br />In a nutshell, this book is a great ride for the nerdier crowd, but still plenty adventurous enough for the regular thriller reader to stay tuned in.	2003-10-28

The first part of the story is a classic Roberts romance, from the heroine who owns the funky little shop to the handsome and hard-nosed hero with a few &quot;unexpected&quot; gentler qualities. This part is also a bona fide suspense novel. We wonder just who the villain is for a while, and then what he will do to get the huge haul of diamonds floating around. The end is very satisfying and neatly ties up the whole story, except for one thing: Where are those gems?<br />The second part of the story is the latest Eve Dallas &quot;In Death&quot; installment, although it doesn't have a separate title. Please note, all those folks who have not read &quot;Imitation in Death,&quot; this IS the next installment in the series, happening very soon after &quot;Imitation,&quot; so unless you want to ruin that book with bigtime spoilers, I highly suggest you read &quot;Imitation&quot; first.<br />The Eve Dallas portion is a tightly written, fast-paced-yet-thorough cop drama that we have come to expect in the Eve Dallas series. All of the interaction with our favorite secondary characters is there, including the gorgeous Roarke, Peabody, McNab, and even Feeney, who was not present in &quot;Imitation.&quot; The notable exception is Summerset. I won't say anything more about his absence so as not to spoil &quot;Imitation in Death.&quot;<br />This is a terrific two-for-one novel with the well-done experiment of bridging a story over almost 60 years hitting the mark in a big way. Highly recommended reading!!	2003-09-28

Eve Dallas' police work and the growth of her character.<br />The main drawback of this installment of the series is the lack of interaction with the secondary characters. Even Roarke seemed a little cookie cutter this go-round. However, having said that, I believe there is a legitimate reason for it that goes deeper than lack of inspiration.<br />Essentially, the character of Eve was feeling cut off from her loved ones in this story. She was dealing with inner demons quite a bit -- not as dramatically as in some previous books, but nonetheless she was definitely withdrawn to some degree while she dealt with new information about her past. Also, several of the secondary characters, such as Peabody, were dealing with life changes and were not their &quot;usual selves.&quot;<br />I think that the story functioned as a mirror of Eve's own innerlooking attitude, life changes of several characters, and finally and perhaps most importantly as a bridge to the next phase of the series. I won't say what that phase is -- you will know as soon as you finish the book -- because I don't want to spoil the story.<br />But believe me, while the story itself may not satisfy the reader as much as Roberts' earlier installments, I think that it serves its purpose perfectly and sets up a lot of new things that will keep the series as a whole fresh for years to come.	2003-09-08

Vaguely-Cajun hunk John Paul Renard as the love interest/partner in justice was also just fine.<br />My main problem is with the highly one-dimensional, sometimes terribly stereotypical supporting characters. From a convenience store clerk and his wife that screamed \\"Deliverance\\" to the cookie-cutter psychopathic mother (Jilly) who was a heck of a lot better at seducing criminal men than being a one herself, most of the characters besides our dynamic duo just didn't do much for me.<br />I understand why Garwood resorted to a more stamped-out cast than usual. The plot is absolutely the star of this show -- even more than Avery and John Paul. But I still miss her rich supporting characters. Two other problems that I will not explain for the sake of not spoiling potential readers:<br />I wanted to know what Anne's letter said.<br />I wanted more face-to-face interaction between Jilly and Avery.<br />This book is great summer reading. It's certainly a bit short on the consuming romance classic Garwood fans normally expect, but if you like action-adventure stories too, that more than makes up for it.	2003-07-23

In fact, \\"Tietam Brown\\" is so different I am having a hard time quantifying it for this review. But I do know this: It's good. Very good for a first fictional effort. Part comedy, part tragedy, part horror, part coming of age story, \\"Tietam\\" really cannot be summed up with one sentence. Much like real life, the bad blends with the good, \\"normal\\" is only a word, no one is totally what they seem, and those whom we love the most can also hurt us the most.<br />If you have read Foley's autobiographical works, \\"Have a Nice Day\\" and \\"Foley Is Good\\" or even just watched his wrestling career on TV, then you will see flashes of Mick in \\"Tietam.\\" Bits of Mick's quirks are entwined in both Tietam and Andy, and occasionally a \\"Mickism\\" is used. In the beginning, the writing style pretty closely follows \\"Have a Nice Day,\\" but soon finds its own rhythm and goes down a much darker and more literary path. Mick's perverse humor is also very apparent, much to my delight. :)<br />But don't let the author's name and background fool you: This is not a \\"wrasslin' book\\" or \\"Foley's Life Part 3.\\" Instead, \\"Tietam\\" is a wonderful study of forgiveness, of right and wrong, of the limits that people put on their love -- both for themselves and others.<br />Most of all, it's the story of Andy Brown, a high school student who has spent most of his life in foster homes and an orphanage and who survived a terrible car accident at the age of five. His father, an enigmatic, mercurial man, comes into his life after a 17-year absence, and immediately the reader knows Andy will never be the same. However, this reader was shocked to find out just what an emotional, strange journey he will have. Put on your seatbelt and keep it on -- you will need it, because this is one powerful, somewhat surreal story.<br />The character that steals the show is Antietam \\"Tietam\\" Brown, Andy's father. He's smart, vulgar and loves deeply. He exercises naked, has purple fuzzy dice hanging on his rearview and sings along with Barry Manilow. And he can go from \\"normal\\" to crazy and criminal in the blink of an eye. He's not altogether sane. Antietam also has deeply conflicting views of the world and the people closest to him that he does not see as a problem.<br />And that is what makes him so essentially different from Andy. It can be argued that Andy has had a much harder life than his father did up to that age, and yet, Andy has a better understanding of the world around him. It is ironic that a confused, lonely teen has a much clearer moral vision for himself than his world-weary, road-hardened father does, but it is nonetheless true that Andy has the ability to see the shades of meaning, the layers of complexity in people and events that black-and-white thinker Tietam is incapable of.<br />But most of all, Andy is able to forgive. The further you go into the story, the more you realize how important this is. I won't say anything more about it, because I don't want to give away the story, but the idea of redemption runs very strong in \\"Tietam.\\"<br />What sort of person would you be if you were incapable of forgiving anyone, most especially yourself?

It has just the right blend of romance, mystery, science and great characters. It isn't perfect, but it's the best Roberts I've read in a long time, and I would say that it's easily in her top 10 books.<br />The characters in &quot;Birthright&quot; are particularly rich and real. They are smart people (the heroine and her ex are both PhDs; the secondary characters are a lawyer and rare book finder), and dedicated to their jobs and families. You get to see the everyday lives and interactions that really brings a story to life. The romances are totally believable, and by the end you honestly think that everyone should be together. I have read far too many books with romance in them that simply rely on hormones and nothing else, and I was glad that Roberts stuck to her usual &quot;develop the relationship&quot; style.<br />I also loved the archaeology and anthropology aspect of the book. I wanted to be a digger when I was a child, and I never lost interest in the subject, so I might be biased. ;&gt;<br />For those who are not as interested in that: While Roberts certainly does not beat you over the head with the science, it is always in the background, and she brings the human aspect to it. It's not just big words, folks. She tells you why it matters to Callie and Jake, why they feel what they are doing is important, and she does it in plain language.<br />I found the mystery portion of the book to be very well done overall, but more rushed the closer it got to the end. I understand why Roberts did it the way she did, but it was such an unhurried story that the ending was jarring. However, since life is often jarring, especially when it comes to big revelations, I didn't feel that the mystery's answer was unrealistic.<br />The very end was kind of corny (won't tell you what it is!), but honestly after all the angst and conflict, it was kind of like a little treat to finally have some cornball in there.	2003-06-27

Mackenzie, while definitely rough around the edges, is a likable fellow and definite marriage material.<br />However, the reason I could not give it five stars is that the main characters kept having the same argument throughout most of the story. Mackenzie thought he accidentally traveled through time because Jane Everleigh was a witch; Jane thought Mackenzie was mentally ill and hadn't traveled through time at all. So you would get this in varying forms:<br />&quot;Send me back, witch!&quot;<br />&quot;I'm not a witch! It's the illness!&quot;<br />I thought that if I heard &quot;It's the illness&quot; one more time, I would scream. I do realize Jane was mechanically repeating the same line every time the subject of time travel came up so she would not have to deal with the reality of it. It is a valid reaction to something so off the wall happening -- but nonetheless terribly, terribly annoying after you've read it about 25 times before.<br />Truly, overall the book is really great. It is a nice time travel, with more realism than expected, a strong heroine and a hero you don't want to sock in the eye. If you can handle the constant &quot;witch, illness&quot; arguments, it is definitely worth reading.	2003-06-27

I have been frustrated with this type of book in the past.<br />I am carpentry challenged, but I actually want to build a secret room and/or compartment in my home by myself to preserve secrecy. Unfortunately, most of the hiding books I own do not tell you how to actually build anything. They are really just lists of hiding places, with a few hand-drawn type illustrations to give you vague ideas on how to construct them. This includes all of the major ones out there: &quot;How to Hide Anything,&quot; &quot;The Big Book of Secret Hiding Places,&quot; and ironically enough even &quot;The Construction of Secret Hiding Places&quot; is very short on actual building instructions and illustrations. Even worse, a couple are simply retreads of others!<br />This book is totally different and does not reference any other books, and in fact exceeds them in quality in every way as far as content. It appears to be self-published, and the author has obviously spent years thinking about this subject and building the projects he discusses. This is uncoventional carpentry, folks; Mr. Dzindzeleta realizes this and wrote to show you *how to build* this stuff, without getting locked into &quot;example&quot; projects that are too dependent on certain sizes/materials to apply to you.<br />The strengths of &quot;Secret Rooms, Secret Compartments&quot;:<br />It is chock full of quality illustrations that detail the actual working mechanisms for locks, glides, rollers, sliding panels, the operation of hidden doors, and even a special hinge I have not seen before.<br />Even better, the author has the text and the illustrations completely cross-referenced, so you can hold one finger on the page with the illustration and go back again and again as he discusses each design idea or variation.<br />Dzindzeleta also gives ideas for supplies that you will probably need for each project. However, please note that he does not give specific brands or models, because he realizes that every secret room/compartment is totally custom and will be different. He does give you a general idea of materials, and it will get you started.<br />Another strong characteristic is the introduction. Not only does he go into detail about &quot;how to think&quot; multidirectionally to best locate and most easily build your secret room/compartment, he also goes into how incredibly important secrecy is, and gives very good, *detailed* instructions on doing a tour of your home or business to figure out where the &quot;wasted&quot; space behind the walls is or where the best place to &quot;shorten&quot; a room is. He even gets into plumbing, heating ducts, etc.<br />If all of this isn't enough, the design ideas themselves are innovative. Dzindzeleta has ideas in here that I have not seen before, and what's more they are usually a lot better than the other books as well. This includes a unique under-the-stair design, column compartments, a secret elevator, a closet in a closet, box-beam drawers, room divider to mask a secret entrance, floor-access room or compartment, and the obligatory bookcase projects.<br />Other than some (admittedly annoying) typos that do not affect its usefulness, this is simply the best &quot;build your own hiding place&quot; book I have ever read. I do recommend that if you want &quot;all&quot; the possible hiding place ideas for your home, that you purchase &quot;How to Hide Anything&quot; by Michael Connor in addition to &quot;Secret Rooms, Secret Compartments.&quot; Connor's book is the one that the retreads always copy, and was obviously the standard &quot;good&quot; hiding book back in the 1980s, when most of the hiding books were written.ompartment is totally custom and will be different.

But when I thumbed through this book and then read it thoroughly, I was impressed by the fact that many of the techniques in it are easy and require minimal tools, supplies and skills. \\"Home Security\\" also has very good color illustrations (and some photos) that show you exactly what the text is saying. As a visual learner, I appreciated that very much!<br />The real gold in this guide, however, is the sheer wealth of information. For instance, I personally didn't know one lock from another (other than a deadbolt is better), and \\"Home Security\\" has a whole page full of illustrations with pros and cons of each type of lock and where they are best suited for in your home. It gets down to details such as shape of the lock's bolt, and how far into the doorjam it should go. \\"Home Security\\" also answered the simple question of which way should the door swing --in or out -- to provide the best security. (It's in.)<br />This book is a great way to get you started. The information is basic and shows you in which direction to go, and how to think about the most common ways thieves get in and take things. In fact, I am in the research stages of building my own house, and for others like me, this will prove invaluable, because we can build the security in as we go along instead of doing a \\"quick fix\\" to badly secured features later.<br />Subjects covered by the book, in no particular order, are:<br />Do a home inventory and a \\"security tour\\" to determine what you have and the weak spots in the home<br />Childproofing<br />Insurance<br />Alarm systems -- the biggest single section of the book<br />Securing windows and doors all over the home, including basement<br />Locks<br />Fences and lighting<br />Fire safety, including types fire extinguishers and smoke detectors<br />Apartment and condo dwellers<br />Securing special targets (guns, jewelry)<br />How to convert a regular closet to a security closet<br />How to get into the habit of security<br />Vacation security<br />Security when you are at home<br />Some thoughts on handicapped-accessible home designy<BR>Security when you are at home<BR>Some thoughts on handicapped-accessible home design	2003-06-19

The publishing house tried to have their cake and eat it too -- they wanted the \\"thrill of abduction\\" on the cover, thus the woman being carried off -- but they also couldn't make it seem \\"scary\\" or realistic so the lady and her pretty-boy abductor are grinning like fools at each other. It just comes off as a bit forced and surreal.<br />Once you get inside, you will see there are three selections in this book: \\"Redbird\\" by Diana Palmer, \\"The Bluest Eyes in Texas\\" by Joan Johnston, and \\"The Bounty\\" by Rebecca Brandewyne.<br />I enjoyed \\"Redbird\\" the most because the characters and the situation they found themselves in were believable. The author did not gloss over the possible consequences of the kidnapping, and instead worked with it. I also believed that the two would actually want to be together and make their marriage work by the end. Finally, I really liked the hero, a must for me to truly enjoy a romance story. While he could be rash, he is really a big lovable bear, with the nice twist of not being a ladykiller in his behavior. He is a good mix of Alpha and Beta characteristics.<br />\\"The Bluest Eyes in Texas\\" was OK, but it was over-the-top cliched with Ranger Burr Covington being obsessed with the social-economic differences between him and the governor's daughter, Lindsey Major, and especially with her blue eyes. I realize it's the title, but Johnston relied on the \\"blue eyes\\" theme to the point of annoyance. Considering the abruptness of the ending and the fact that I didn't believe for one minute Covington would have really proposed that soon, she could have deleted half of the references to \\"blue eyes\\" and saved the words for more character development and a better ending.<br />I liked \\"Bounty\\" the least. While it has the hottest sex scenes, I simply did not like Rafer Starr. He is a cliched Alpha-bad boy character. He sees \\"strong\\" Hayley Harper and immediately wants to \\"tame\\" her down, like some sort of house pet. This story also relied far too heavily on sexual chemistry and simply did not make me believe the characters were compatible for anything more than a roll in the hay by the time the story ended.<br />I felt that Palmer (\\"Redbird\\") did the best with the short format the authors were restricted to, and made the most of the space she had to create a more realistic romance. \\"The Bluest Eyes in Texas\\" would have benefited from more space to make the story less one-dimensional and allow for a richer, fuller maturation of the characters' relationship and especially a better ending. \\"The Bounty\\" would have not been any better with more space, just longer. Rafer Starr is simply not a likable character. His attitude is, \\"Sure honey, we can have a partnership. As long as I'm always in charge and you let me take care of you!\\"me sort of house pet.

It has beautiful photos in it, with a wide variation of house styles, sizes and cool solutions tailored to each homeowner/family. That being said, what intrigued me the most was *why* Susanka chose the houses, and what she saw in them that worked with her &quot;Not So Big&quot; philosophy. I have not read her original book, so none of the information was rehashed in my reading. Perhaps if I had, I wouldn't have enjoyed this book so much. However, I suspect that &quot;Creating the Not So Big House&quot; offers more in the way of practical application of the theory and is therefore valuable on its own. I also figure that since it shows personal interpretations of Susanka's original thoughts on homebuilding, it offers a different &quot;flavor&quot; of the same basic idea.<br />This book also made me want to buy the original, so I can get more of the pure &quot;mindset&quot; part of Susanka's message. Perhaps that was part of the point. :)	2003-06-18

That's why it only gets three stars.<br />However, that being said, there are three stars' worth of reasons to buy this book in particular: hiding things on your person, smuggling, unconventional hiding methods (mobile/mail/etc.), and concealed weapons.<br />If you are looking for a good &quot;hide-it-in-your-home&quot; book like I was, then Michael Connor's &quot;How to Hide Anything&quot; is your best bet, as it covers everything from furniture to drains to hotel hidies when you're on a trip and is just an excellent all-around thief protection hidie book.<br />However, if you are more interested in the more uhm... how to put it diplomatically?, SEMI-legal reasons for hiding stuff, then this book definitely has information to offer that Connor's best-known book does not.<br />Final note: As with all hiding books, almost all of the projects require you to have carpentry skills and a lot of patience. There are no step-by-step, hold-your-hand instructions on construction. It is up to you to make the ideas presented work for you.	2003-06-16
US	52946163	RRB9INQ3IAB3W	0878336532	543927333	Everything You Need to Know About Building the Custom Home: How to Be Your Own General Contractor	Books	3	62	62	N	Y	An unfortunately titled, but still valuable book	This book should probably have been called &quot;How to Prepare Yourself Legally and Financially to Build Your Own Home.&quot; The title it does have is not representative of the book's true focus, and I believe does a disservice to those who want a construction book *and* those who would benefit from the legal and financial information it so richly covers. One group is disappointed, while the other skips over it because they think it doesn't apply to their needs.<br />To be blunt, the actual construction process is not very well covered. For instance, owner-builders probably do not know what types of materials are high quality vs. just high price tag vs. &quot;standard&quot; and possibly inadequate. That is a huge hole in the book -- materials overall are skimmed over. The one time they got specific, they almost sounded like a commercial for Andersen windows. I'm sure Andersen windows are just fine, but I seriously doubt that you simply &quot;must&quot; buy them to have resell value in your house.<br />The other huge hole is how to manage the actual building phase -- what to expect, pitfalls and such. Yes, it has a chart, but it's hard to read (it's sideways!), there is no explanation if the numbers signify days or weeks, and in general it is not adequate. There was a very short chapter at the very end on common mistakes, but once again it seemed to skim over that information. Also, I realize that every house is built differently, but it would have been nice to have one example project used throughout the book so that the reader could see a cohesive picture of how that particular house was built. Nothing like a concrete example!<br />In spite of its shortcomings and the rather dated ideas about what makes a home have resell value (this book was written in the early 90s, just as &quot;starter castles&quot; with cavernous ceilings and huge greatrooms were becoming popular), this book offers a ton of good -- and most importantly, timeless -- information.<br />In a nutshell:<br />If you need or want to know about the financial and legal process of building your own house, right down to the surveying, appraising and loans, including sample contracts and forms, then buy this book.<br />If you are interested in a guide on how to actually *build* a quality, custom home that has updated materials lists, a detailed example schedule and realistic work/time/money expectations, worksheets and samples of change orders, contracts for craftsmen and other construction sundries, then do not buy this book.shell:<br />If you need or want to know about the financial and legal process of building your own house, right down to the surveying, appraising and loans, including sample contracts and forms, then buy this book. <br />If you are interested in a guide on how to actually *build* a quality, custom home that has updated materials lists, a detailed example schedule and realistic work/time/money expectations, worksheets and samples of change orders, contracts for craftsmen and other construction sundries, then do not buy this book.	2003-06-16

While all of them have useful ideas, the strong suits of this book are the outdoor, structural, and away-from-home hiding places.<br />The outdoor hidies are great for those with their own land. There are several innovative ideas that the other books do not have, including a tree stash.<br />The structural hidies are also different -- these aren't just making false drawer bottoms. :) There are pipe, appliance, wall and even drain hidies. Furniture hidies are covered extensively as well, but this review focuses on what makes this book different from the other hiding books.<br />The away-from-home hiding places are ingenious, easy to do and will hide your valuables from the casual thief and the sticky-fingered maid alike. Obviously, there is little to no carpentry involved and in fact you could use the same principles in your own home if you are carpentry impaired like me. :)<br />One last strong point of this book is the writing. Throughout, it talks about the psychology of the thief and why some hides work better than others to prevent theft. The main focus is not hiding things from the government or the police, who often have a whole different mindset and a lot more time than a thief does. If you are more interested specifically in strategies to hide objects from law enforcement or the government, there are hiding books that focus on that rather than thieves and I recommend you get one of those instead.<br />Please note: As with all hiding place books, you simply must have some carpentry experience and a lot of patience. There are no step-by-step, hold-your-hand instructions on how to make a hiding place here (or in any other hiding book I've seen either). The ideas are presented, and it is up to you to make them work in your own home or land.	2003-06-16

It is chock full of ideas, both in the text and the pictures, for innovative storage all over the house. Another important thing to me is that the writers of this book realize that it is often the details, such as the height of a bench or the placement of a drawer, that can make or break a storage solution. They encourage the homeowner throughout the book to choose the solutions and dimensions that fit their house and their lifestyle. Function is the No. 1 priority, but form is not shortchanged at all, as the photos prove.<br />While some of it does not apply to my situation, I found that there were at least a few areas -- most notably the mud room and why it's such a great idea -- that were beneficial to me. I had already thought a lot about storage in the house I will be building, so it probably was not as helpful to me overall as it would be for someone who is either starting to think about this subject, or who has an existing house with storage problems. That being said, the photos and the writing are both high quality, and no basic room in the house is left uncovered, so this book is definitely a 5-star.<br />If you own Taunton's other books, you may recognize a few of the photos from them. However, most of them are not duplicates of the other two Tauntons that I have, and even the ones that are the same are covered completely differently.<br />I have only one complaint with this book: There is no index in the back. There is a page of resources, which provides some books and some Web sites, and a long list of photographer credits, but I would like to have seen some sort of an index of keywords or specific storage ideas. In spite of this shortcoming, the book is so logically put together that it still deserves all five stars.	2003-06-16

It skips a lot of background information you probably don't need, and just gives you a simple &quot;equals&quot; format that for most things is sufficient. When more information is necessary, the authors give it to you in the form of short recipes to make equivalents.<br />The one thing this book won't do is perform a miracle for you. If you don't have anything that resembles an onion in flavor, you will not be able to substitute an onion. If you have nothing that can do the leavening job of cream of tartar in your pantry, then you can't switch it out, either. The key is to have a well-stocked pantry. Then, if you run out of &quot;that one thing&quot; you need, you can indeed substitute it from the items you do have on hand.<br />Other great aspects of this book:<br />&quot;Too Much&quot; section: Tells you how to &quot;unruin&quot; items that have too much of some strong-tasting ingredients.<br />Measurement equivalents section: Has dry and liquid equivalents (like 3 teaspoons = 1 tablespoon) in the English system. It also great for those on the metric system/English system trying to do a recipe from the &quot;other side,&quot; because there are ounces/grams and pounds/kilograms charts.<br />Temperature equivalents: Fahrneheit to Celsius for all common cooking temperatures.<br />Baking pan sizes: metric/English numbers compared; number of cups held by many cake pans also.<br />Household formula section: A nice intro to homemade cleaning products using common ingredients.	2003-04-17

I'm positive my *grandchildren* will be reading these books alongside the Narnia and Oz books, and loving them.

I have read - and use regularly - several natural cleaning books, including another of Annie Berthold-Bond's titles, \\"Clean & Green.\\" However, I have become interested in \\"green living,\\" not just cleaning. That means switching from commercial household products to homemade products for personal care, pest control, etc. That is what led me to \\"Better Basics For the Home.\\"<br />\\"Better Basics\\" is far easier to use and much better organized and written than \\"Clean & Green.\\" It is set up in logical sections according to the products' uses. The index is very good. You can find a recipe quickly, although I would suggest you read through the book once and get a feel for how to go about things. Also, one of the best aspects is the \\"Sources and Resources\\" section near the back. If you live in an area without health food stores, woods or land suitable for growing your own herbs, then this will be essential for your ability to find ingredients to make your own green household products.<br />This book is also suitable for the beginner green cleaner. Most of the recipes, once you have the correct ingredients, are very easy to make and quick to put together. That being said, this book is also for people who are really serious about green cleaning, personal hygiene, pest control and other aspects of running a household. I say that because some of the ingredients used in many of the recipes are costly if you have to buy them instead of gathering them from your yard or a nearby wooded area. Also, essential oils - literally essential in green cleaning! - are expensive. (A little goes a loooong way, though.) This is a lot more than vinegar-baking soda-Castille soap cleaning and requires a higher level of commitment financially.<br />As a single person, I also found that many of the recipes, especially the ones that are highly perishable, would make too much for me to use in the time they are fresh. Of course, the easy way to get around this is to simply cut the recipes in half or even a quarter. If you can cook or do some simple math (I'm terrible at math and I have no troubles), then you as a single person can cut the recipes down to a manageable, useful amount. I have already cleaned my leather couch, made lanolin hand lotion (great stuff!) and protected my hemp shower curtain from mildew with a spray-on solution containing tea tree oil. How long did it take? I did it effortlessly in one day, around other chores. Very easy.<br />I would recommend, if you are really interested in green cleaning by desire or necessity, to buy this book and also get \\"Clean House, Clean Planet\\" by Karen Logan. To me, Logan's book is the single best way to get someone involved in green cleaning. Her recipes tend to be cheap, easy and effective. This book has a far greater range of recipes for many more uses, but they are overall more expensive and specialized.<br />Also, a few tips if you are going to get into green cleaning:<br />1) Get equipment that is used only in making your cleaning products. Some essential oils and other ingredients are very bad for you to eat, and mixups and residues could make your day very long and very bad. I have a simple list: a medium-sized Pyrex bowl and 2-cup Pyrex measure, a silicone spatula, *metal* measuring spoons, a whisk and some glass jars with metal screw-on lids you can get at any decent-sized grocery store. With about $20-$30, you can have nearly all the equipment you will ever need.<br />2) Start with one product that is cheap and easy to make, and works on something you want to clean right now. Instant gratification is a great way to get into the habit!<br />3) Especially if you want to clean rather than make personal care products at first, buy one small bottle of essential oil that smells good AND disinfects to cut down costs. I happen to like tea tree oil, but if you prefer a wintergreen type smell, choose lavender. If you find out that green cleaning is for you, then you can branch out into other essential oils more suited for other tasks., choose lavender. If you find out that green cleaning is for you, then you can branch out into other essential oils more suited for other tasks.	2003-03-18

After two frustrating days with &quot;Knitting for Dummies,&quot; I am still on page 15, and I am about ready to throw it into the trashcan.<br />You would think that a book devoted soley to teaching people how to knit would have more than three -- THREE -- poorly drawn illustrations on the knit stitch.<br />But it doesn't.<br />You would think that to show people how to cast on, that the author would start with the easiest method first, with plenty of clear drawings.<br />But she doesn't.<br />You would also think that the needle wouldn't magically jump from one hand to the other in the illustrations of casting on, even though the written instructions with them say something totally different.<br />But I think you know by now that unfortunately, that's exactly what happens. (Check page 13, those of you who own it.)<br />If you are a person who needs visual aids to learn something new, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy this book. Find a video. Find a real live knitter. Call your local craft store and see if they can hook you up with someone who actually knows what they are doing for heaven's sake.<br />Ms. Allen, I'm sure, knows how to knit. But she sure doesn't know how to write a book that can teach this &quot;dummy&quot; how to.	2003-03-16

OK, there are four pictures. Not much better than none, if you ask me.<br />If you have never seen anyone knit, how do you know what it looks like? The illustrations skip steps, they are small and they are dark. You can barely tell which needle is on top, much less what the yarn is doing.<br />This might not have been the death knell for this book if the written instructions had been clearer -- by they weren't. I  *read for a living past the college level*, and I couldn't follow the instructions as given without the visual cues.<br />I have a good college education and I am an experienced crafter. I still find it hard to believe, but I cannot learn this craft with this book OR Knitting for Dummies. (It has basically the same flaws, only some are worse.)<br />If you need visual aids to learn a new craft, DO NOT buy this book! Buy a video, talk to a knitter, call your local craft store to see if there are classes or knitting groups that can help you.<br />I just can't believe that the author so completely failed to convey the single most important aspect of this craft in a visual sense.

Joe is constantly putting himself down for being a \\"low class\\" kind of guy who's not good enough for his \\"high class\\" gal. He also constantly reads just plain wrong things into everything she says, and worries about the tiniest things that come out of her mouth. He keeps thinking all of this in a repeated littany in spite of his many, many talents (too many for him to be a real person, if you ask me). Otherwise, he is portrayed as a highly confident person -- totally incongruous. And the author, after spending pages and pages on this junk running through Joe's mind *all the time*, \\"makes it all better\\" with one sentence from the heroine near the end when she dismissed his dozens of mini-misunderstandings in one fell swoop. BLEG!<br />Speaking of the heroine, Ronnie found herself imagining life as a SEAL's wife as hell (her own word!) because of the constant worry, secrecy and sudden separations. But upon being reunited with Joe, Ronnie simply decided that \\"it didn't matter\\" and that she would stay with him anyway. Talk about being stupid and blind! Come on. He won't leave the SEALs for her, and she won't be able to take it. She knew it perfectly well, acted properly by breaking up with him, and then decided to ignore it because her hormones got the better of her. Boy, is she gonna be sorry in six months. And this woman is supposed to be *smart*?<br />These two are destined for divorce court. I can't imagine that their marriage will last six months, much less \\"forever after.\\" If all the above wasn't bad enough, Mr. and Mrs. Prince Charming are getting married after having known each other barely more than a month, and with very few truly personal conversations or interaction other than smoldering looks and hot sex. I just don't buy it, plain and simple. And there are too many painful plot problems to cover up the blatant mismatch.<br />NOT a keeper.

The plot was obviously more complex and potentially much more entertaining than the small number of pages allowed.<br />I also believe that the main thing most readers have a problem with -- the fact that Chance put Sunny's life in danger after he found out she was innocent, and her subsequent shrugging off of same -- was the &quot;quick and dirty&quot; method that Howard had to use in order to end the story in the space alloted. I noticed that the farther along the book went, the more rushed it became, and the more implausible the plot details. If Howard had another hundred pages, this one would have most likely been as good as the others.<br />As for the other concern that most reviewers seemed to have, which is that the motivation of the villain to kill his daughter Sunny wasn't explained well enough, I don't agree. First of all, Sunny's father wasn't necessarily out to kill her in the beginning. Certainly, he wanted to use her to find her sister, but it wasn't certain for most of the book just what he would do with her once he found her. All Sunny knew was that he was so bad her mother was willing to die to keep her daughters away from him.<br />Secondly, in a plot device the most lax reader should have caught on to, Chance explicity says that he believes anyone who is a terrorist is either evil or crazy. Howard also makes the father a child molester, a wife abuser, a ruthless criminal, and a psychotic killer of the worst kind. On top of that, he had never even met Sunny before the events in the book. Howard made sure we knew that although Sunny is his daughter in name, emotionally she was like anyone else he might meet on the street: nobody. Howard also made it very clear that the daughter he &quot;cared&quot; about was Margreta, and he had been sexually abusing her! Don't look for well-explained, background-rich motivations for someone who is characterized as simply crazy and evil. Once again, this was a plot shortcut that Howard took, but it actually made much more sense than the one she took with Chance.that Howard took, but it actually made much more sense than the one she took with Chance.	2001-09-23

Not only did he keep all the things I liked about &quot;Have a Nice Day!&quot; -- especially the lovely flow of his jokes -- but he has produced with &quot;Foley is Good&quot; a better-structured piece that also showcases his interest in things other than wrestling. (But don't worry, there's plenty of wrestling stuff for the fans.)<br />It's a great book to read aloud because of Mick's timing. You'll laugh through most it, guaranteed. Mick has a brand-new whipping boy -- Test. But don't worry, poor Al Snow gets his share of ribbing, including a photo of him in drag! The Mean Street Posse are once again the mid-card whipees.<br />Be prepared to get out your Kleenex, because you'll surely cry through the chapter on Owen Hart and another friend of Mick's who died of cancer, Brian Hildebrand. He was a referee that never worked for the WWF, but who was beloved by many.<br />Mick really shows just how intelligent he is at the end of the book. Within those chapters are his own study of sex and violence in wrestling, then his discussion on the similarities between the McCarthyism era and the PTC's tactics. He conducted interviews with a researcher, probably watched over 30 hours of video tape, attempted to contact the PTC itelf, and ended up with a very convincing argument that wrestling is no worse than soap operas, &quot;Cheers&quot; and Monday Night football.<br />The recently born Mick Foley Jr. (Mickey) also makes an appearance, and if you're a fan of the rest of the Foley family, the ultra-cute Dewey and Noelle and of course the &quot;hot&quot; Colette are right in there.<br />Mick also provides several top ten lists, including his favorite theme parks, rides and of course, wrestling matches. I won't say which one is his favorite, but if you are any kind of a Foley fan you know it's *not* the Hell in the Cell from '98 with the Undertaker.<br />In short...just read it! You'll never regret picking it up. Now all we have to do is convince Mick to start writing history books.

Frugality is such a foreign concept in the United States that obviously many people were horrified at what they found here. Some were also extremely critical of the way Mrs. Dacyczyn raises her children. While they are entitled to their opinions, frankly, that's not the subject of this book.<br />The reason for this book is to save money. You don't have to do everything that appears in it. *Amy* doesn't do everything in the book. There are so many tips in this tome that if you can't find one thing that will do your wallet some good, you never really wanted to save money to begin with.<br />Which brings me to why I think many people have a problem with this book. I believe what they expected were &quot;quick and easy&quot; (i.e. painless and instant) ways to make money magically appear. Unfortunately, life doesn't work that way. If you want to save money, you are going to have to spend less of it -- which means yes, you are going to have to sacrifice.<br />I believe this book is very focused, very practical, and way way too honest for most people to handle. If you actually are serious about saving money, then dive in and enjoy. If you're not, I suggest watching late-night television for a real-estate selling infomercial.	2001-01-28

For MacKenzie lovers, of course, it's a must no matter  what.<br />The characters were interesting and held promise, but the sexual  tension and romantic interaction in general seemed a little forced. That is  unusual for Howard; if nothing else, she usually gets that part absolutely  right.<br />The heroine was a computer expert working on a military plane  project, so the plot was much more technical than is typical for a romance  or a Howard novel. There were a lot of complicated details to get through  to make the story make sense, and Howard's usually rich  character/relationship development suffered.<br />Despite its shortcomings,  this is still a very readable and entertaining book.

All of the information in the book comes from readily available public sources -- WWF videos, magazines and  matches; Rolling Stone and Texas Monthly magazines; and of course (although  inexplicably to a lesser degree) the A&amp;E biography.<br />Williams had no  input into the book. Nor, apparently, did anyone who actually knows him.  The writer tried to make up for the lack of biographical information about  Steve Williams the man by resorting to a miserable play-by-play of Steve  Austin's major WWF matches. The book also suffers because it sounds much  more like a flowery press release from the WWF than something meant for any  kind of serious reading.<br />Worst of all, although he acknowledges that  wrestling is scripted, the author consistently and purposely confuses  angles and storylines from the TV shows and PPV's for real-life interaction  between Williams and his co-workers in the WWF. He liberally uses quotes  from the character of Steve Austin to make them seem like things Steve  Williams &quot;said.&quot; He ridiculously proposes that while Steve  Williams used to be &quot;a good boy&quot; before he was a wrestler, he  &quot;turned heel&quot; in real life to become Stone Cold. In other words,  the author tries to make it seem as if Stone Cold is actually Steve  Williams instead of a character he plays on TV.<br />Now, add to that glaring  holes in the basic events of Williams' life: Brian Pillman is glossed over.  There is no mention of Williams' first wife at all or any of his friends  other than Pillman (and one sentence on his taxidermist). There is barely a  paragraph about Williams' two daughters, just slightly more about his other  relatives. When you add in some factual errors in the few biographical  items actually used, this book just doesn't cut it as &quot;the story of  Steve Austin&quot; and is certainly not the story of Steve Williams.<br />If  you want to know something about Steve Williams, watch the A&amp;E  biography, read the Texas Monthly article, Rolling Stone, and be sure and  don't miss Mick Foley's and The Rock's autobiographies. Those few sources  have more true information about Williams than this book.<br />If you want to  know something about Steve Austin, grab a Steveweiser, pull the footrest  lever on your La-Z-Boy, and enjoy some of Austin's classic matches on tape.

In fact, there are several in the book  that aren't that effective, but at least they don't poison you.<br />However,  the majority of her recipes *are* effective and very easy to make. Logan  writes matter-of-factly, but with a positive style. It's not like reading a  textbook or cookbook at all; you are entertained as you read.<br />There is a  broad enough range of recipes that you can clean nearly anything, but not  so many that you can't figure out which recipe to make for which cleaning  job.<br />In contrast, I found that Annie Berthold-Bond's book &quot;Clean  and Green&quot; was too cluttered by a confusing array of recipes, some of  which are so specialized many people will probably never use them. Also,  her writing style is far too dry to really be enjoyable.<br />If you really,  really need a weird stain out of your clothes and don't want to reach for  the bleach or stain stick, you may want to pick up &quot;Clean and  Green.&quot; But for just cleaning floors, tile, windows, etc. it is *much*  easier to use the simple, multi-purpose recipes in &quot;Clean House, Clean  Planet.&quot;	2000-04-19

His life story is his own, and The Rock is his own character. So...why are most of these reviewers angry with Johnson (and his book) for not being &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; or &quot;4 Ever&quot;? I guess they wanted to spend 18 bucks on  exactly the same thing they spent to read in Foley's (great) book,  or whatever they spent to read in Anderson's book.<br />Don't get me wrong --  this book is *not* a masterpiece, like Foley's book. But it doesn't s#$k.  In fact, it's a pretty good read. Dwayne Johnson has not done what Mick  has, either in his life or in his book. What he has done is tell his own  experience, his own life. And I think it's worth it to read  it.<br />Yes, there is a big section in the middle in which he calls his own  matches as The Rock speaking in the third person. But why are you all  surprised? Did you think The Rock wouldn't show up?<br />Johnson refers to The Rock as a separate person  throughout the book (as he should) because Dwayne Johnson *is not* The  Rock. It's a character he plays, a skin he walks into when he works. I  think that it is appropriate to give The Rock his own section because of  his importance in Johnson's life. However, I do think it could have been  cut in half without hurting a thing.<br />So here it is: The Rock starts on  page 163 (Chapter 11) and Dwayne Johnson takes over again on page 227  (Chapter 14) and pretty much stays in control from there. I stuck with it  and was not disappointed.<br />If you didn't stick, you missed Johnson's  really cool rememberance of how he worked with Steve Austin to make the  Wrestlemania XV match as good as they could get it and how they celebrated  afterward. You missed the tribute to Owen Hart. You also missed what Dwayne  Johnson thinks of The Rock as a character and a lot of his thoughts on the  role of fans in his work.<br />Judge this book on its own merits. Johnson and  his ghostwriter make a pretty good team, and the book is quite  entertaining. If you can't handle as much of The Rock as Johnson dishes,  skip that section.

This author does. Or at least, that's how he wrote his book. I understand he is writing for 9-12-year-olds, but basically his book fails in every regard.<br />First, it's simply an overwritten list of his matches and angles.  It has almost nothing to do with the man himself.<br />Second, what little Dan  Ross did say about Austin was about his character, not him as a person.  However, the author presented the information as if it was actually Austin  himself, and not the characters he has played over the years. It even  blames some of the front offices' angle decisions on his  &quot;arrogance&quot; and other traits that were his characters', and most  likely had nothing to do with what was actually going on behind the  scenes.<br />Third, he got major facts wrong, like where Austin is from (it's  NOT Austin, Texas!) and how he got the name Austin (it's NOT because he's  &quot;from&quot; Austin, Texas!).<br />The only saving grace is the pictures.  There are a few I haven't seen before. But inexplicably, there are actually  more pictures of other wrestlers than Austin himself. Do I detect someone  trying to pad out their book?<br />I wasn't expecting a lot from this book,  but it didn't deliver the bare minimum. The author assumes the fan reading  the book is a moron, and he wrote accordingly. If I were anyone looking for  a book about Steve Austin, I would wait and see if the WWF puts out his  (ghost-written) autobiography in 2000 or 2001.

Put a good  writer together with great raw material, and you come out with this  something the caliber of this book -- the best autobiography I have ever  read.<br />This book would appeal to those who are not wrestling fans, but who  are curious about people who have done extreme things, or simply turned  their lives over to a cause. Mick's cause just happened to be professional  wrestling.<br />Kudos, Mick! You've done a great job.	1999-12-05

The movie was OK, but the book was better. And as far as I'm concerned, the audio book is the best! Narrator Chris Noth, a Law &amp; Order alum, portrayed all the characters except Alex Cross, who was competently read by Robert Guillaume.<br />Noth made this book. He grossed me out, scared me, made me laugh, and generally amazed me with his vocal acting range. He portrayed both killers remarkably well; they were similar in many ways, as they should have been, yet he picked out subtle accent and other vocal differences that made it easy for the listener to pick them out after hearing them only once or twice.<br />In short, the narrator can make or break an audio version of a book, and Noth made this one, hands down. In fact, he had me wishing that they would have let him portray Alex Cross, too, because I think he could have pulled it off with ease. This is definitely the version of the book to get!	1998-06-25
