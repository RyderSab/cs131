However, though I'm not in the habit of reading romance novels, I wouldn't have minded that aspect of this book if it had been well-written in any way. Obviously, it isn't. It's dull and shockingly unfocused. The contrived dialogue strains to hit all the necessary plot points and sounds totally unnatural. And why so many characters? Does the author really expect us to care about them all? I couldn't even bring myself to care about the main character--I hated her almost immediately. <br />I was initially excited to read this book because it takes place in Australia--a welcome change of pace from the New York setting of most chick lit. Too bad the book was so terrible. It needed a serious editor to cut down the length and smooth out the writing. Too bad Red Dress Ink doesn't seem to employ any competent editors--and incompetent writer plus incompetent editor equals completely lousy book.	2003-10-12

It's really too irritating for me to even recommend it as a beach read. I realize that, because Molly Jong-Fast is Erica Jong's daughter, publishers were probably lining up to buy this manuscript. They should've held off.  Molly Jong-Fast also should've held off on publishing a novel until she'd acquired a little more wisdom and writing skills. This should've remained in her bottom drawer or the pages of her journal, the unpublished novel that led to better work but was never seen by anyone. Too bad she had to go and show it to people.	2003-04-26

Too bad she's not really good at anything.  Her music \\"career\\" began and ended with one novelty hit 20 years ago, her acting \\"career\\" basically amounted to a one-episode stint on \\"Party of Five,\\" and now we have this, an obviously highly autobiographical novel with \\"America Throne\\" playing the part of Moon Unit herself. On the back cover, Alanis Morissette has contributed a quote praising the \\"egolessness\\" of this book. I guess what she means is that, through America, Moon Unit allows us access to all her most mundane or downright stupid thoughts and deeds, no matter how humiliating they may be. But in fact, Moon Unit's believing that the general public would actually be INTERESTED in her most mundane and stupid thoughts and deeds is really the height of egotism (or as Alanis would probably put it, \\"egofulness\\"). In the book, Moon Unit also complains quite a bit about how having a famous father ruined her life. Yet she seems perfectly happy to use his fame when it suits her--after all, this book probably wouldn't have gotten read or even published if the author's last name weren't \\"Zappa.\\" It's unfortunate that this book, with its patriotic-sounding title, was published in September 2001, when most of us began to renew our own patriotism.  It's too meaningful a title for such a shallow, shallow book. Moon Unit, let me assure you, it's not too late to go back to school and become an accountant or something. ... .	2002-08-11

Since \\"Bridget Jones\\" was published I've been enamored of \\"chick lit\\" books because of their potential as light reading that's more intelligent and relatable than most bestsellers.  Unfortunately, so few chick lit books have actually lived up to that potential (\\"The Perfect Elizabeth,\\" \\"Good in Bed,\\" \\"Milkrun\\"... all garbage).  Fortunately, with Marian Keyes, my search is over.  I don't know how she keeps turning out 500- and 600-page books that are so full of humor, great characters, and genuine emotion, but I'm SO glad she does.  \\"Rachel's Holiday\\" was the first of her books that I read, and I loved it, couldn't put it down, was sorry when it was over, and missed the characters for days afterward.  If you, like me, loved \\"Bridget Jones\\" and have been frustrated in your search for something as satisfying, try Marian Keyes.  You won't regret it.  Other Keyes novels I've read, and therefore recommend: \\"Last Chance Saloon\\" and \\"Sushi for Beginners\\"--the latter is available only in the UK, so give amazon.co.uk a try.	2002-02-17

Don't get me wrong--I'm a big fan of chick lit, like the Marian Keyes and \\"Bridget Jones\\" books. But even light entertainment should be well-written, and this book isn't.  It's a huge, almost plotless mess, dull and full of errors.  The narrator, Jackie, works as a copy editor for a publisher, but ridicules a co-worker who actually cares about good grammar and punctuation. Well, somebody associated with this book should have cared a little more about those things.  In addition, Jackie is an annoying and unlikeable heroine who feels compelled to share her boring, unremarkable thoughts on every little thing.  For instance, she thinks soy milk tastes like regular milk with sugar in it. She doesn't drink red wine because it stains her teeth.  And, she feels that if you go to a cosmetics counter for a free makeover, it's not really free because you'll be expected to buy the products that were used, although you can usually get away with buying just a lipstick, but if you get a free gift with purchase, that usually contains a lipstick as well, although it's never the color you want. . . . WHO CARES???  Does the author really think Jackie's thoughts are interesting and original?  The book is not only tiresome, it's at times downright unpleasant--the author seems fixated on the topic of body odor. I'm shocked at the good reviews on this page, but I figure most of them were written by the author's friends and relatives (a dead giveaway: the numerous \\"unhelpful\\" votes the negative reviews have received).  The first Red Dress Ink book (\\"See Jane Date\\") was better than I expected, but this one was much worse.  I truly wish I hadn't wasted my time on it, not to mention my [money].  There are a lot of books out there--please trust me when I say you can find a better one than this!	2002-02-17

However, the novel itself is nowhere near as satisfying as a good cup of coffee.  The writing is embarrassingly bad--remedial and awkward.  The narrator, Eliza, is annoying.  The book also isn't very funny, although you can tell the author really wanted it to be.  The relationship between the sisters isn't fleshed out very well (in spite of the book's subtitle), and Eliza's eventual career trajectory is completely unbelievable. In addition, in spite of the book's ostensible moral that you should be your own person and not follow the crowd, the book ends with Eliza, lemminglike, diving for the bouquet at a wedding--I guess so she can marry the boyfriend with whom she recently reconciled (in spite of the horrible way he treated her).  Overall, I would call the book a complete failure (except for the great cover) and a serious waste of time.  Keep moving, there's nothing to see here.	2001-11-25

What's more, many of them are very rigid in their beliefs and openly disapproving of anyone who questions them.  Thus, I'm glad Nicholson Baker is there to champion the other side.

I guess this book is mainly read by people who are assigned it for a college class--that's when I first read it, back in 1991.  Still, it's a good, interesting book on a serious topic, and deserves to be read by the general public.  It covers topics like rape, sexual harassment, hate crimes directed at lesbians, domestic violence, and pornography.

(You know how it is--so many books, so little time.)  Still, I've re-read this novel over and over.  Simply put, it's extremely funny, impeccably written, and contains some of the most vivid characters you'll find anywhere. My advice to those considering this book:  read the first ten pages or so.  If you're drawn into the story and/or find yourself laughing like a crazy person, then you know this is the book for you.  If these things DON'T happen to you, well, I'm sure you're got good taste in some other area of your life. :)  Really, if you're a fan of good fiction, you should give yourself the opportunity to experience the unsung, underrated James Wilcox, and this book is the best beginning.	2001-04-29

This book is just fun, fun, fun--a well-written, absorbing novel that you won't want to put down.  It takes place in the 1970s and intriguingly depicts the interwoven lives of a group of young people living in the same apartment building.  It's the best kind of summer read--100% enjoyable, 100% intelligent, 100% good-hearted without being overly sappy.<br />One other thing: this book does contain some depictions of sexuality--gay and straight--that could be seen as promiscuous, if you are inclined to think in those terms.  However, the reviewer on this page who griped that Maupin was &quot;irresponsible&quot; to write this way (given the AIDS epidemic that surfaced in the 1980s) must not realize that this book was WRITTEN in the 1970s.  It's an accurate depiction of how life was back then.  If you read the other books in this six-part series, you'll see that as they move into the '80s Maupin DOES deal with AIDS by having his characters deal with it.  These novels are actual snapshots of the time they were written, not some sort of retroactive nostalgia trip.  They are fully realized, fabulous achievements, and open-minded readers will love them.  All six books in the series are highly recommended.	2001-04-29

If I have the story straight, James Redfield initially published this book himself, and it sold so well that he was offered a deal with a major publisher.  Fair enough.  If Warner wants to publish, and the citizens of the world want to read, the half-baked ramblings of some weirdo who thinks he's got a lock on spirituality but appears to be making the whole thing up as he goes along, that's their prerogative.<br />However, this book would have been somewhat less of a train wreck if the author had just published it as a straightforward religious tract, rather than as a novel.  Redfield obviously knows NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING, about what makes a good novel.  The dialogue is atrocious, the characters are ridiculous, and the whole thing is mind-numbingly boring. As a former English major and longtime voracious reader, I'm actually offended that Redfield would use the form of the novel to get his ideas across, yet show absolutely no respect for that form.  Not everyone can write a novel just because they feel like it; what made this dude think he could?  If you're looking for some good fiction, avoid this like the plague; if you're looking for some guy you've never even met to show you your spiritual path in life, well, God help you.	2001-04-29

I know that a lot of you Owen Meany lovers refuse to believe that anyone could possibly have a good reason for disliking this book.  But the fact is, this is a very flawed novel, and there are plenty of reasons to dislike it.  And no, I'm not just angry at the anti-Reagan passages in this book--I AGREE with those.  And no, I'm not just a hard-hearted person who hates anything that's the least bit sentimental.  I like sentimentality as much as the next person.<br />Still, there's a fine line between sentimentality and just plain being manipulative.  Manipulation occurs when an author gives you a contrived situation and unrealistic characters and expects you to really care about them.  That's the case here.  The integral plot point involving &quot;the shot&quot; (if you read the book you know what I'm talking about) is unbelievably contrived.  The plot just doesn't flow in a natural way--it feels very ARRANGED.  More importantly, how you feel about the book really depends on how you feel about Owen Meany himself.  If you just love him, you'll like the book.  If you think he's annoying (and he does have a lot of annoying characteristics), you won't care what happens to him and thus probably won't like the book.<br />Other problems with this novel include a pronounced shift halfway through the book--from childhood memories to a politically charged drama.  Plus, the thing is just too long!  And no, I don't have a problem with long books per se--some of my favorite books are 500+ pages long.  But some books go on way longer than they should, and John Irving is one of the most frequent offenders in this category.  <br />If you want an enjoyable Irving read, I'd recommend &quot;A Widow for One Year.&quot;  It also goes on too long, but at least you won't be force fed an unconvincing (in my opinion) lesson about spirituality.	2001-04-29

Many of the books  sound really interesting, and the guide should be very helpful for a lot of  readers.<br />However, be warned that it's not quite as comprehensive as it  seems.  The back-cover copy says the book contains recommendations from  &quot;reading groups nationwide,&quot; but the introduction reveals that  the groups are really only from California, Oregon, Colorado, and New York.   As a result, West Coast authors and books are over-represented.  This  isn't a bad thing--you'll learn a lot about authors you may have never  heard of before.

This is a horrible book, a muddled mess.  Its biggest problem  is Amy, possibly the world's most shallow, unlikeable heroine, who truly  doesn't deserve the happy ending she receives.  The charming hero (the one  saving grace of the book) is so appealing one wonders what he could  possibly see in a twit like Amy.  Plus, the book sometimes steps back and  takes a detached, omniscient-narrator tone that is supremely irritating and  simply doesn't work.  Worst of all, the book isn't funny at all, although  it tries valiantly to be.<br />I realize that not every piece of literature  needs to be deeply meaningful, but it should at least be well written and  somewhat convincing.

In fact, I found it compulsively readable, and although I was in the middle of another book when I started Jemima J, that other book was promptly left to languish on my nightstand until I finished this one. This is a good novel to read poolside; it will hold your attention.<br />However, the more I think about this book, the more annoyed with it I get.  As they say, God is in the details, and this book gets a lot of them wrong. First, I was annoyed by Jemima's idea that Americans (and particularly Californians) don't \\"get\\" sarcasm. Uh, sorry, that's just not true. Southern California gets the short end of the stick in other ways as well. The whole idea that if you enter a Starbucks and just ask for a \\"cappuccino\\" (without prefacing it with a lot of adjectives like \\"nonfat,\\" \\"half-caf,\\" etc.), people will gawk at you as if you're a freak is completely tired, not to mention inaccurate. Also, I seriously doubt that the bookstores in Santa Monica contain nothing but books on the film industry. Give me a break. Plus, the clothes Jemima chooses after she loses the weight sound ridiculous and outdated--not stuff you would wear if you wanted to look beautiful (if you wanted to look cheap, maybe). Even the name of Brad's gym is hopelessly lame--\\"B-Fit\\"? Please. This stuff gets really annoying after a while. In addition, as somebody else on this page has mentioned, Jemima's initial weight of about 200 lbs., at a height of 5'7\\", is not as huge as Green makes her out to be. Of course, this could be the fault of the U.S. editors who Americanized the text. In fact, since Green was presumably writing not for an American audience but rather for her fellow Englishwomen, most of the above gripes can be forgiven.<br />Harder to forgive are the more major annoyances. First, our romantic hero, Ben. I believe that he's good-looking, and he sounds perfectly nice, but I'm not convinced he's all that deep. His character is not developed enough to give us a real window into his psyche; instead he just seems a little slow on the uptake. Plus, if his feelings for Jemima are based on who she IS (as opposed to what she looks like), why did they not develop before she lost all the weight? Additionally, Brad's ridiculous \\"shocking secret,\\" revealed at the end, borders on the implausible--if all he wanted was a trophy girlfriend, why did he need to import one from England? Surely somebody that good-looking and successful could have found someone nearby. Green's lack of attention to these matters undermines the story she's trying to tell. Plus, as other reviewers have noted, the way the book switches back and forth between first person and omniscient third person gets irritating and just doesn't work.<br />Ultimately, I would say the book is somewhat shallow and not very well-thought-out. Plus, it's not funny; you won't laugh out loud the way you will with Helen Fielding and Nick Hornby. Jane Green is certainly not on a level with Marian Keyes.  Read this if you must, but keep in mind--you've been warned.	2000-07-09

You would not be wasting your time by reading it.  However, there are several problems with the way this is written that make me think Jane Smiley at some point lost control  of what she was trying to accomplish.<br />First, the book is basically  divided into two parts--a long segment that takes place in the Kansas  Territory, and a not-as-long part that takes Lidie off on the adventures  alluded to in the title.  The first part is way too long.  Although I  understand Smiley needed to set everything up in order to knock it down,  there must have been a way to do it in fewer pages.  Reading about how  difficult life is in the Kansas territory gets tiresome after a while, and  I was just waiting and waiting for something to happen.<br />When things  finally do begin to happen, however, Smiley crams so much action into the  second half of the book that there's barely a chance to take it all in, and  the various events lose their impact. After the rush of all these events,  the book just kind of fizzles out.  You never learn what becomes of the  rest of Lidie's life, which is pretty frustrating.<br />Another problem is  that Lidie herself starts out as a neutral sort of character--she becomes  an abolitionist because her new husband is one, but she admits that she has  never thought much about the issues herself.  Maybe Smiley intended to have  Lidie become more righteous and firmly abolitionist as the novel went on,  but this just doesn't happen.  She seems pretty neutral about the slavery  issue right up to the end. Which is not to say that the book doesn't take a  stand against slavery--it does, in a powerful way.  But it does so through  an escaped slave named Lorna, not through the ambivalent Lidie herself.  <br />One of the other reviewers here mentions that the book is very  historically accurate. This is admirable, and I did learn a lot about the  Kansas Territory, which I appreciate.  But a novel should do more than just  be historically accurate.<br />If you think the subject matter of this book  sounds interesting, or if you're a big Jane Smiley fan, you will probably  like this one.  But if you're just looking for a really good, engaging book  to read, I would respectfully suggest you look elsewhere.	2000-05-28

Even if you're not a Sarah fan, you'll probably sympathize with  her after reading this hatchet job.  It must be tough having people write  things like this about you.  Please, please, don't waste your precious time  and money on this debacle of a book.	1999-11-28

I think most of the people who gave this book negative reviews are in denial.  You can't deny how competitive women's gymnastics and skating are,  and how much emphasis is placed on appearance and on winning (look at how  Kerri Strug was basically forced to do a vault with a severely injured  ankle in the 1996 Olympics--&quot;shake it off,&quot; indeed).  Even those  of us who are merely spectators can see what a high-pressure situation it  is, and you can't deny the truth of the stories of Julissa Gomez, Christy  Heinrich, and the others.  The author is not calling for the abolishment of  these sports, just for some changes that might actually make competing a  positive, enjoyable experience for the athletes.  I hope coaches and  parents of the athletes read this book and take it seriously, but most of  them will probably deny that it applies to them.  Highly recommended.	1999-10-24

I would characterize this as light entertainment, but it's extremely well-written and funny and the heroine of 5 of the stories, Jane, is very likeable.   However, note that there are two stories in the book that are NOT about  Jane; the breast cancer story, &quot;You Could Be Anyone,&quot; has a  different heroine altogether.  I wanted to emphasize that because in the  past two days I have read two published reviews indicating that Jane  survives breast cancer in the book.  That story is not about Jane, okay?   It's not.  But it's still good.  I highly recommend the whole collection.	1999-07-25

I can't believe how many people liked this book--they must not do much reading or they'd know how completely unremarkable this is.  The characters are cardboard and the story is 100% unoriginal.  The numerous descriptive  and explanatory passages are unimaginative and try the patience.  Somebody  in my book group selected this; what a joke--there was absolutely nothing  to discuss. Plus, the ending was completely manipulative, pouring on the  sentiment to try to get you to care about characters that are completely  unreal.  I guess Nicholas Sparks is laughing all the way to the bank, but  as a writer he has no talent.  The only kind of book I can't stand is the  kind that insults my intelligence, and this one does. To the people who  loved this: please, browse around amazon.com and expand your horizons a  bit.  If you do more reading, maybe your taste will improve.	1999-07-11
