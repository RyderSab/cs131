With titles ranging from \\"Treasure Island\\" to \\"Coral Island\\", two novels by Charles Dickens were also among the collection: \\"Pickwick Papers\\" and \\"David Copperfield\\". From an early age I was aware Charles Dickens had a reputation as one of the World's Great Writers, but until recently (July 2005) I had never actually read any of his work. After letting it sit on the shelf unread for twenty years I finally picked up \\"David Copperfield\\". Although it was 900 pages long (the pages were very thin and often stuck together) I finished it in just over two weeks.<br /><br />Simply put, the book is basically David's long journey from boyhood to manhood. He is telling his life story, beginning with the chapter \\"I Am Born\\", and over the years we witness his experiences of joy and sorrow, hope and despair. David describes his life in vivid detail, the early years of trauma, loss and poverty, the forging of friendships, the shock of betrayal and secrets exposed, and ultimately, the finding of love.<br /><br />The Victorian writing style may seem verbose to the modern reader but I was more or less prepared for this after reading Mervyn Peake's \\"Gormenghast\\" books. I knew Mervyn Peake was heavily influenced by Charles Dickens, particularly in the creation of bizarre, colourful characters. In fact Mervyn Peake's character Steerpike bears a striking resemblance to David Copperfield's enemy Uriah Heep, with his high shoulders, dark red eyes and insidious demeanour. Mervyn Peake's Fuschia shares all the silliness and immaturity of David Copperfield's beloved Dora. And the prolixity of Dr. Prunesquallor's speech is just as bewildering as any of Mr. Micawber's monologues. (Copperfield's ability to remember conversations is extraordinary.)<br /><br />Charles Dickens certainly had the ability to make his characters seem three dimensional and \\"real\\". Everyone is fully fleshed out, if a little exaggerated. While reading \\"David Copperfield\\" there were times I almost envied the main character (during his happier moments). You really feel like you're being taken back to another time and place.<br /><br />During his lifetime the work of Charles Dickens was immensely popular. Dickens even had the honour of being praised by Queen Victoria. The fact that his books have made a lasting impression on English literature cannot be denied. George Orwell was an avid reader of Dickens. Maybe I'll read \\"Oliver Twist\\" next.	2005-07-25

Full of mystical imagery, spirituality and incredibly detailed landscapes, it is often hard to tell who has done what. Before I acquired this book I was already familiar with the name Roger Garland, having seen his work on the covers of a few J.R.R. Tolkien books. The Tolkien images are quite a contrast to those of Alan Lee and John Howe. These are reproduced here, along with so much more. <br /> <br />The paintings in this book, mostly rendered in oils, are richly detailed, showing a strong pre-Raphaelite influence. I liked reading about Linda Garland's experiences at art school, saying how she was scared to admit she liked the pre-Raphaelites for fear of persecution. Art in the 1960s didn't seem to put much emphasis on technique. Even basic skills like figure drawing appeared to have been stamped out in favour of esoteric \\"happenings\\".  <br /> <br />After art school Linda and Roger both found work teaching art in high school. From the way they describe the job, it sounded like a pretty frustrating time. \\"Glorified babysitting\\" was one description used. <br /> <br />However, Roger and Linda both started to get commissions for illustration work, and the rest is history. When reading this book one gets a real sense of how precarious the life of a freelance illustrator can be, especially the financial worries that loom when work dries up, the feelings of guilt about being seen walking a dog in the middle of a working day, and all kinds of other uncertainty. <br /> <br />The paintings themselves are of a very high standard. Many of them are book cover commissions, but there are also designs for board games and playing cards, as well as some private commissions. As mentioned before, one chapter is devoted entirely to Middle-Earth, another chapter is \\"The Living Zodiac\\", and there is also a section pertaining to folklore and legend. <br /> <br />Enthusiasts ofhigh fantasy are sure to be spellbound by the works presented here. Overall \\"Garlands of Fantasy\\" is a very enjoyable, entertaining book.	2005-06-05
US	50780673	R1UVBYBAXSWEDT	1932586121	135681198	Crippled Dreams	Books	4	22	24	N	N	Love and Faith	\\"Crippled Dreams\\" is a love story but it is also a story of conflicts. It begins with the Franco-Prussian war of 1870.  After a pregnant French woman was brutally attacked by four Prussian soldiers, she gives birth to a son, Alexandre, who is paralyzed from the thigh down. Throughout his formative years Alexandre takes some solace in books but by the time he is in his early twenties he is embittered and frustrated, totally dependent, yet desperate for life experience. He can only watch with envy and resentment as his younger brother Gustave reaps rewards. Gustave is equally resentful of Alexandre, jealous of all the attention lavished on him by his pious, over-protective mother Rose, who is torn by guilt. <br /> <br />While Rose is deeply religious, Alexandre finds it hard to believe in a Saviour that has left him the way he is. Nevertheless he dutifully goes to church, where the minister urges his congregation to accept that a happy, full life is not to be found in the acquisition of material goods and short-term pleasures. Fame and fortune are meaningless. Faith and spirituality are far more rewarding in the long run. (This is an appropriate point to recommend the non-fiction book \\"Status Anxiety\\" by Alain de Botton.) Those who appear to have everything are in actual fact plastic and superficial, lacking the fundamental qualities that make it possible to live a truly satisfying life. The minister explains what those qualities are more fully. <br /> <br />The conflict between the two brothers is intensified with the arrival of Marie-Anne, who, to Alexandre's disappointment and heartbreak, is betrothed to Gustave. Alexandre is convinced Marie-Anne is making a grave mistake, not marrying because of love, but to fulfill an obligation to society.  <br /> <br />Another conflict in \\"Crippled Dreams\\" is that of science and religion. For much of the book Alexandre maintains his scepticism, finding more credibility in the cold logic of science. Rose is desperate for Alexandre to accept God's love in order to save his soul. Alexandre is an agnostic who half hopes that there is an afterlife, because it would make all the senseless misery in the world, the suffering endured throughout history, worthwhile and meaningful. There is a comfort in believing that the life we live in this world is merely a preparation for the eternal life of the next world.  <br /> <br />Are we supposed to choose religion over science, or can we accept both? It is a telling point that \\"Crippled Dreams\\" is set in the late 19th century. In the century that has passed since Alexandre's time, the world has become increasingly secular as science has achieved much that was once considered impossible. Today there is talk about stem cell research, a subject considered controversial by many, but having the potential to wipe out needless anguish.  How would Alexandre have felt about it if he had lived in our time? If God made us in His image, giving us the knowledge to learn, grow and progress, it wouldn't be sacrilegious to perform our own miracles, would it?  <br /> <br />I think I'm starting to ramble now so I'll conclude by saying that \\"Crippled Dreams\\" is a very thought-provoking book. Very well written.	2004-12-29
US	50780673	R39H03BMPN5MJU	0316769487	862964341	The Catcher in the Rye	Books	4	0	1	N	N	A Famous Killer Loves This Book	\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" (1951) is a book I had heard quite a lot about over the years. It got a brief mention in the introduction of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", when someone was comparing Alex to Holden Caulfield (the teenage protagonist of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\"). I never had to read the book at school but I knew some who did. Apparently a lot of girls make their boyfriends read it. I also learned that it was Mark Chapman's favourite book. (Mark Chapman was the guy who killed John Lennon, in case you're wondering.) Chapman's enthusiasm for the book would more accurately be described as an obsession, as he seemed to base his life entirely around the mind set of the angry young narrator. <br /> <br />Last week I finally got round to reading \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", which I really just bought on a whim. Personally, I quite liked the book, it made a change from the kind of literature I normally read. Although I couldn't relate to Holden Caulfield  completely, certain things did strike a chord.  <br /> <br />Like many teenagers, Holden is plagued by a crisis of identity, a sense of nihilistic self-pity, an unshakable belief that adults are all phony, everyone sells out and society is superficial.  Is this just self-indulgence? Well, yes, but that is one of the luxuries of being an adolescent: to be convinced that everyone except you is a moron. Holden even concedes that he himself may be a madman, so he's not completely pig-headed. While Holden see double standards and hypocrisy everywhere, he too admits to being a huge liar. Hypocrisy is not a uniquely adult condition, it's just as prevalent in childhood. No one can have a frame of mind completely free of contradictions and inconsistency.   <br /> <br />Set in the 1950s, the story takes place over a couple of days in New York, with Christmas approaching. Holden, who has just been kicked out of yet another school, lets us in on his cynical world view. Like the typically confused and \\"sensitive\\" rebel, Holden seems to be disillusioned with everything, a listless soul with no real sense of direction in life. Two or three other characters try to help him but their advice goes in one ear and out the other. If there is one person Holden truly loves and admires, it is his younger sister Phoebe. She seems to be the only character in the book that hasn't let Holden down. She still has her innocence. Sadly, this can't last forever. She too will grow up, and it's just possible her outlook too will descend into cynicism.  But for now we see Phoebe as a ten year old girl with ideals. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the kind of uncertainty Holden contends with doesn't necessarily fade away with the onset of adulthood.  Since Holden was a teenager in the 1950s, it would be interesting to know what he would be like today as a middle aged man, assuming he survived the turmoil and angst of adolescence.  Would he have straightened out? From what we read in the book, one can only hope he has. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-12-19

I've been interested in Atlantis since childhood but I prefer to think of it as a myth. Many archaeologists hate Atlantis, refusing to believe in the teasing possibility of a vanished civilization swallowed by the sea. But it's been a source of inspiration for many SF and fantasy writers, ranging from Jules Verne to Robert E. Howard. C.J. Cutcliffe Hyne's novel \\"The Lost Continent\\" (1900) begins with the discovery of an ancient manuscript in a cave in the Canary Islands. In describing the events leading to the destruction of Atlantis, the narrator Deucalion tells an action-packed story of adventure, romance and revenge. <br /> <br />After giving up his post as viceroy for the colony of Yucatan, Deucalion, a warrior-priest fiercely loyal to the gods, and completely devoted to duty, returns to Atlantis for the first time in twenty years, finding it very different to the spiritual, prosperous land he remembers. <br /> <br />Atlantis is now governed by the Empress Phorenice, a beautiful but ruthless tyrant hell-bent on crushing opposition. Despite Phorenice's physical beauty, her evil mind and lack of conscience enables her to inflict acts of cruelty on her subjects without a qualm. Like most power-hungry autocrats, Phorenice views the suffering of others with casual disdain or amusement. In her endeavours to strengthen her power as a self-proclaimed deity, she treats the gods with an equal level of scorn and contempt, as she discovers more and more of their secrets. <br /> <br />Phorenice now wants Deucalion to be her husband. As Deucalion is a fatalist, believing his life to be in the hands of the gods, he agrees to her wishes and sees the full extent of Atlantis' fall from grace. Cruelty and brutality are commonplace in Atlantis, among the splendour of its spires and temples, and anyone who incurs the displeasure of the Empress is punished with torture and death. Under these conditions, it is not surprising that rebellion is growing. <br /> <br />We already know the ultimate fate of Atlantis but this doesn't stop the reader from enjoying the story. C.J. Cutcliffe Hyne was a writer with a sense of humour and this sometimes comes through in the dialogue. Deucalion fits the mould of the ideal fantasy hero: strong, daring, brave and articulate, a possible precursor to Conan, but a bit more intelligent. And celibate. Phorenice is the archetypal femme fatale. <br /> <br />Sadly \\"The Lost Continent\\" is the only book C.J. Cutcliffe Heine is remembered for today. Despite a productive career much of his work is now forgotten. But anyone fascinated by Atlantis will want to read this. \\"The Lost Continent\\" is reputed to be the best interpretation of the legendary civilization.	2004-11-07

After conducting a secret test on the uninhabited Jubila Plateau in India he believes he has discovered the solution - a device that can vaporize an area of land within a one mile radius, reduce living things to &quot;their original elements&quot;, and theoretically destroy a city in one blow. Franklin Huxtable is the father of the atomic bomb.<br />With this ultimate weapon it would seem reasonable that Huxtable's discovery would cause squabbling leaders to come to their senses and abandon the folly of war. But things are not as simple as that. At the behest of Queen Victoria, Huxtable is obliged to keep his invention secret. Ironically for Huxtable the century in which he lives is full of missed opportunities to put his findings to use: the Crimean War and the American Civil War being a couple of examples. For more than thirty years after that test on the Jubila Plateau,  Huxtable is unable to make his weapon publicly known. If only film and television had been available in the 19th century, Huxtable could have recorded that detonation and things might have been so much different. <br />&quot;Queen Victoria's Bomb&quot; (1967) is essentially a story of Huxtable's life, beginning with his days as a young student at Cambridge in the 1830s, when he was friends with Alfred Tennyson. Over the next fifty years he associates with many other famous people including Henry Lane, Queen Victoria, her husband Albert, Florence Nightingale, and Hiram Maxim, the inventor of the machine gun. Through Joseph Dalton Hooker, Huxtable becomes aware of mutated plant specimens that grew in the vicinity of the Jubila Plateau, and Colonel Godwin-Austen describes a tribe whose members have been afflicted with all manner of deformity. They too lived a few miles downwind from the atomic explosion.<br />The value of knowledge seems to be an important issue in this book. As we know, progress is a double-edged sword, something that can be used for good or evil. As Arthur C. Clarke once pointed out, people use fire for evil purposes, but civilization wouldn't have existed without it.  There was a famous library in Ancient Alexandria that was damaged by fanatical arsonists. A lot of valuable knowledge was lost. Carl Sagan believed the damage done to this library may have delayed the Renaissance by a thousand years. The point is, it may be possible to slow down progress, but ultimately it can't be stopped. It's a matter of deciding whether or not we're ready for a great discovery, whether we're ready to accept its consequences. <br />As &quot;Queen Victoria's Bomb&quot; points out, there are questions of morality to consider. Real-life history has proven that atomic bombs are horrible weapons, but they haven't made war unthinkable to the statesmen. The twenty-first century will be just as blood-thirsty as the last, maybe more so. In addition to &quot;Queen Victoria's Bomb&quot; I recommend Kim Stanley Robinson's short story &quot;The Lucky Strike&quot;. This can be found in &quot;The Best Alternate History Stories of the Twentieth Century&quot;.	2004-06-26

They might as well be a beautiful mannequin. (Could that mean an afterlife in hell is more meaningful than an afterlife in heaven?) If people have no understanding of the bad, then they can't fully appreciate the good. Then there's that old adage about taking the rough with the smooth.<br />The word mannequin fits as a description for the people in \\"Brave New World\\", in the sense that they are mass produced and identical. As a matter of fact they are clones, bred in the Hatchery, their role in life predestined through gene manipulation and mental conditioning.<br />While the society in \\"Brave New World\\" is described as dystopian (lack of individuality, lack of choice, devoid of substance), there are some things to be envied too. Everyone feels secure with a sense of belonging, no one is starving in the gutter, there is no racism, no violence, no motivation for violence, and of course, no war. If anyone wants to check out of reality for a while they can take soma, a euphoric drug with no serious after-effects. Everything is unnatural and artificial. (But then, hasn't civilization always been unnatural and artificial?)<br />In essence, everyone feels content. Well, almost everyone. Bernard Marx sees the world around him, and is all too aware of its insipid shallowness. He sees himself as an outsider, someone who finds it impossible to fit in. As a man who refuses to \\"join the party\\", he chooses to wallow in his own discontent, to indulge in his own intellectual superiority. He won't even take soma. Naturally, this kind of behavior draws some unfavourable attention, particularly from Mustaphor Mond, the World Controller.<br />When Bernard takes a break from this society of claustrophobic togetherness, he travels to the United States, visiting a Reservation where people can live the \\"old-fashioned\\" way (fall in love, have families, contract disease). There, he finds a savage called John. Bernard takes John back to London, where he is seen as a freakish novelty, and Bernard, by association, enjoys a period of celebrity status. Like Bernard, John soon realizes how lifeless the people are and tries to escape.<br />Written in the 1930s, \\"Brave New World\\" has an ambivalent quality about its description of the future. We naturally assume that the future will be better, that every generation is better off than the one that precedes it. The world we live in now (in the West, at least) does have some similarities. Sex has long since lost its taboo status. In fact, people never shut up about it. There are those who see modern society as decadent, immoral and ungodly. To the more fanatical types, it is so repugnant, they seek to destroy it and impose their own way of life on the rest of us. That is a price we pay for free will and diversity. When we live in a world where no one can agree, and people are too stubborn to respect the beliefs of others,  there is always trouble.<br />\\"Brave New World\\" is unlikely to be forgotten as an important piece of literature, but I prefer George Orwell's \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" (1949) when it comes to dystopian fiction.

When I tried explaining to other children that humans and apes may have evolved from a common ancestor they just sort of sneered in disbelief. This was over a hundred years after Charles Darwin had died. <br />Jack London's first SF novel \\"Before Adam\\" is an imaginitive, compelling read. Through his dreams, a twentieth century man \\"remembers\\" events from another time and place -  a life lived at the dawn of time. The narrator \\"Big-Tooth\\" shows us  the harsh brutality of prehistoric life, the endless struggle to survive, the constant danger posed by predators  looking for food, and the menace of the \\"Fire Men\\" - a race more advanced than the species Big-Tooth belongs to, a race that have learned to use fire and kill prey with bows and arrows. It's very rare for anyone to live beyond middle age. Most people die violent deaths, either at the hands of a rival, or satisfying the hunger of a beast.<br />This is not the first story with a prehistoric setting (Jack London was apparently accused of plagiarism by another author, Stanley Waterloo), but it's a wonderful book nevertheless. London later wrote a book with a similar premise called \\"The Star Rover\\", in which a condemned prisoner puts himself into a trance and experiences his past lives. It's possible that J.G. Ballard had also read \\"Before Adam\\" before writing \\"The Drowned World\\", another book about race memory and the retreat into prehistory. There's a lot of psychology in it.<br />As a species we've certainly come a long way, or so we like to think. The slaughter initiated by the Fire Men looking for living space has been repeated time and time again. Our \\"intelligence\\" has enabled us to come up with more ingenious ways to kill each other, moving from bows and arrows to guns to weapons of mass destruction. From what can be seen on television or read in newspapers, it seems we're still a long way from \\"growing up\\". Jack London's novel should teach us not to be complacent.	2003-11-29

From &quot;The Last Man&quot; would come books like &quot;The Scarlet Plague&quot; (1912), &quot;Earth Abides (1949) and &quot;The Stand&quot; (1978), each work taking something from its predecessor, each work written in a separate, distinctive era. The passage of time would allow writers to be more graphic in terms of aftermath, as readers became more sophisticated and less disturbed by what earlier generations would consider &quot;horrifying&quot;.<br />&quot;The Last Man&quot; takes place in the late 21st century: a future without telephones, cars, television or computers. In fact life in the 2090s is not that different to the 1820s, apart from a few political changes (Britain is now a republic). Readers who criticized &quot;Earth Abides&quot; for being dated would have even more to complain about here. Shelley could not possibly have guessed the advances, social and technological, that would take place since 1824. Therefore it's helpful for the modern reader to pretend the story is happening in an alternate 21st century, along the lines of &quot;Pavane&quot;.<br />The narrator Lionel Verney spends the first third of the book describing his early life, telling us how an altruistic young man of noble stock (Adrian) took him under his wing, effectively saving him from a life of penury. Lionel and his younger sister now mix in the highest circles, the cultured world of art, literature and music (things which the working class had nothing to do with in the 1820s).<br />Mary Shelley's prose is formal to say the least. Containing echoes of Byron and Wordsworth, it is rich, stylish and philosophical. It is not until Part two of the novel that the plague makes its appearance. When Shelley describes the plague there is mention of bodies lying in the open and the breakdown of order, butshe doesn't treat it with the kind of brutal frankness that Stephen King does in &quot;The Stand&quot;. It does look as if King was influenced by Shelley however. Here is a quote from &quot;The Last Man&quot;:<br />&quot;The ward was filled with an effuvia that caused my heart to heave with painful qualms. The dead were carried out, and the sick brought in, with like indifference; some were screaming with pain, others laughing from the influence of more terrible delerium; some were attended by weeping, despairing relations, others called aloud with thrilling tenderness or reproach on the friends who had deserted them while the nurses went from bed to bed incarnate images of despair, neglect and death.&quot;<br />Here is a quote from &quot;The Stand&quot; one and a half centuries later:<br />&quot;Wards were crammed. Patients lay on the floors. The halls were full; nurses, many of them obviously sick themselves, wove in and out, some of them weeping hysterically. Others looked shocked to the point of coma.&quot; King also adds little details like the smell of waste and the cries of the damned. While Shelley is poetic, King is direct and to the point. He was writing for an audience whose attention span has been diminished by things like television and films laden with special effects. The impatient 21st century reader may therefore find &quot;The Last Man&quot; more of a challenge. <br />Although Shelley's plague is  more gradual than those of other writers, society is still crumbling. Even though extinction is in the air, the main characters still perform acts of heroism. The character Adrian has all the makings of a saint. It's just unfortunate that there will be no one left alive to canonize him. Although  &quot;The Last Man&quot; is dated, it did pave the way for a genre that  still fascinates and terrifies readers today. Mary Shelley is owed a great debt in terms of apocalyptic literature.	2003-10-26

It's also where I first encountered the work of Jim Burns and Boris Vallejo. <br />\\"The Guide to Fantasy Art Techniques\\" is a somewhat misleading title. This is not a \\"how to\\" book, but a series of interviews with some of the most talented practitioners of fantasy art. The artists do mention the materials they use, but that's about all. The caption \\"Where did you get the idea?\\" is pretty simple to answer: from the writer of the manuscript, or the brief given by the art director.<br />There are interviews with eight artists: Jim Burns, Ian Miller, Patrick Woodroffe, Phillip Castle (the one who did the \\"Clockwork Orange\\" poster), Syd Mead, Chris Foss, Martin Bower and Boris Vallejo. The artists talk about their early days, their influences (favourite artists, comics) and so on. Some went to art school. Others didn't. Some found art school a tremendous learning experience. Others didn't.  <br />My only criticism is that the book doesn't give the dimensions of the artwork. The only real idea you get of size is in the photo of Boris Vallejo sitting next to his easel, or Martin Bower standing with his model spacecraft. It's hard to pick out a favourite artist from this lot, but I think the one I connect to most is Chris Foss. He was very influential in SF art, even inspiring Jim Burns. I like that phrase Patrick Woodroffe uses, \\"to skirt the edges of kitsch\\". I'm not sure how his work would go down at art college. Woodroffe makes another telling comment, regarding the perception of \\"artists\\" as opposed to \\"illustrators\\": \\"For me most of the best artists are illustrators anyway. Some people describe painting as 'literary' as if it were an insult. I don't see why you have to be very abstract or self-effacing to produce something worthwhile\\". This is very true. Think of all those Renaissance paintings with religious subject matter, inspired by the biggest bestseller of all time. People still admire them centurieslater as \\"art\\". <br />There's a theory I've been mulling over regarding the definitions of art and illustration. Illustration is something that everyone can understand. Art is something only the initiated can understand. Maybe that's an unfair generalisation, but there does seem to be an element of snobbery over what constitutes \\"real art\\". I guess it's all a matter of personal taste. <br />While the best part of the book is the artwork, along with the interviews, Martyn Dean writes a good afterword on the subject of imagination and inspiration.

I've only started to read his work recently, starting with that irreverent novel about Jesus \\"Behold the Man\\", the peripatetic adventures concerning Elric, and now \\"Dancers At the End of Time\\".<br />This series of books is set in a future well beyond our own time. For Jherek Carnelian and the rest of his kind, our world is so far in the past (hundreds of thousands of millenia in the past) that history and Hollywood, fiction and fact have blurred together. Moorcock takes us so far into the future that \\"sand\\" on a beach is actually crushed bone, and characters behave in ways which would shock even the most open-minded people of our own society.<br />In Jherek Carnelian's society it is impossible for anyone to feel shock. No one is encumbered with the conventions and standards which we in our own time feel obliged to live by. In the future life is one long game without rules, a fairground in which to indulge. Death is practically an obsolete notion. Sounds like heaven on Earth, doesn't it? As space and time are no longer barriers, it wouldn't surprise me if another time traveller like Karl Glogauer had gone into the past and \\"implanted\\" the concept of heaven - the misinterpreted promise that all the misery and suffering, the turmoil and deprivation, would eventually be rewarded with everlasting life and blissful harmony. All in exchange for  clean living and a lot of faith. This would have been a cruel trick for a time traveller to play, even if it wasn't intentional.<br />In the early 20th century Marcel Duchamp once declared that anyone can be an artist. In Jherek's time everyone is an artist, able to create their own environments to whatever specifications they desire, alter their bodily appearance whenever the whim takes them, and build menageries filled with specimans culled from anywhere and anywhen.<br />Jherek has a fondness for anything associated with his favourite period the 19th century. Whenit comes to nostalgia past eras are best loved by those who never experienced them. It's like someone obsessed with Robin Hood holding a romantic view of the Middle Ages. One object of beauty coveted by Jherek is the elegant Mrs Amelia Underwood. Much of Moorcock's story concerns Jherek's attempts to win the heart of Amelia Underwood in a series of well-intentioned gestures and temporal wanderings. I don't want to say too much more than that, but rest assured, it's an eventful ride. Sometimes it's hard to keep track of what the characters look like as they keep changing their appearance, but just hang in there. When Jherek pursues Amelia in 1896 he's like the proverbial fish out of water. You won't be disappointed.	2003-09-04

In a way, it's  ironic that an Australian should have written this book. The publishing of science fiction in Australia is on nothing like the scale of America or Britain, but we've got a core of talented writers making themselves known. There's more to Australian culture than a love of sport. <br />Unlike the TV shows that explain how a magician does his tricks, &quot;The Science in Science Fiction&quot; is not a book that tries to take the sense of wonder out of an imaginitive genre. Rather, it discusses the viability of ideas which science fiction writers commonly exploit, e.g. time travel, hyperspace or cloning, describing how these things may be achieved in the future, and the steps scientists are currently taking to make fact out of fiction. <br />If there is one thing this book teaches us, it is that we shouldn't be  too dismissive of things that sound like idle day-dreaming. There  was a time not so long ago when people scoffed at the idea of walking on the Moon. Look where we are now. Unfortunately, it is also possible for us to bring about the end of the world with those much talked about &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot;. <br />Towards the end the book does provide a list of failed predictions and wrong science. Quite rightly, Nicholls points out that the space craft in &quot;Star Wars&quot; would be inaudible in space and that laser beams would be invisible, but he does concede that films like &quot;Star Wars&quot; would be less fun if they stuck too rigidly to the facts. Invisibility sounds great until you realise that invisible retinas would result in blindness.<br />It is interesting to read about the section on cloning, because at the time of writing no one had yet succeeded in the cloning of mammals. It would be another fifteen years before the controversy over Dolly the Sheeperupted. This information about cloning is accompanied by an amusing illustration of two Ali clones in a fierce boxing match.<br />Science fiction has provided a wealth of inspiration for both writers and artists. Things may not be achieved in the way they imagined, or in the time that they predicted, but we can still accept the phrase &quot;all things are possible&quot;.	2003-08-29

At the same time, I bought an insanely optimistic manual called &quot;Surviving the Holocaust&quot;. Coincidentally, the lady at the counter was reading a &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; comic. We must have been on the same wavelength.<br />This book was published in 1985. That year marked the fortieth anniversary of an event that changed the world forever: the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Throughout the ensuing Cold War years many lived in fear of a nuclear conflict and the horror it would bring. In the 1950s and 60s a plethora of science fiction books and films imagined what the world would be like After the Bomb. Some were chilling, others were unscientific nonsense. But for nearly forty years there was one after-effect of  nuclear war that people had not thought of: the possibility of a nuclear winter.<BR>  <BR>Owen Greene, Ian Percival and Irene Ridge wrote this sobering book when the theory of nuclear winter was just a couple of years old. The basic idea of a nuclear winter is that all the smoke and dust released from the explosions in a nuclear holocaust would linger in the atmosphere, obscuring the sun, causing a huge drop in temperature. The duration of this nuclear winter is variable. Scientists predict anything from a few weeks to a couple of years. But while it lasted, the Earth would be cold and dark, causing plants to die, which would then lead to widespread starvation for animals and humans. All this on top of radiation, disease and social chaos. <br />Even if the survivors (who had hitherto taken a technological world for granted) managed to live through the nuclear winter and see the sun again, their troubles would not be over. The ultraviolet light from a damaged ozone layer would make the shrunken, weakened population even more susceptible to cancer, agriculture would be almost impossible, and the ever present radiation would slowly finish everything off.<br />This all sounds like gloomy stuff. The nuclear winter theory has been a cause for heated dispute but the book makes it clear that even without a nuclear winter conditions in a post-holocaust world would be far from favourable. The scenarioes outlined here are all based on unknown quantities, estimates and a bit of educated guesswork. The nuclear winter is horribly plausible, although H.G. Wells, the first writer to imagine a nuclear holocaust as early as 1914, once wrote that the plausible theories are usually the wrong ones. Hopefully he was right. This is a case where we should hope fiction never becomes fact.	2003-08-21

While the first two books were collaborative efforts, this novel is a &quot;solo&quot; work by the Naylor half of that writing gestalt known as &quot;Grant Naylor&quot;.<br />When the book begins Dave Lister, or rather &quot;a version&quot; of Dave Lister, has been sentenced to eighteen years Hard Thought in the penal colony Cyberia: eighteen years imprisoned in his own virtual hell. Hard Thought is a punishment where the prisoner's most dreaded fantasies  are made real. In Lister's case, being trapped in a world where neighbours  play Neil Diamond records full blast. That, and a whole lot of other nasty tortures.<br />Meanwhile the Lister we know, along with Rimmer, Kryten, Cat and a recently resurrected Kristine Kochanski, are flying in Starbug towards the Omni-zone, the point in space where all the different realities converge. They are diverted from their course back to Red Dwarf when they come across a derelict craft: another Starbug. One where the crew have been slaughtered and Lister is missing.<br />A dying version of Kochanski tells the others that someone took Lister. They take it upon themselves to find this other Lister and rescue him. This marks the beginning of a series of hilarious misadventures, wrong turnings and bad, bad choices, as we travel across a galaxy populated by genitically engineered lifeforms, broken down 'droids and homicidal villains.<br />&quot;Last Human&quot; makes you think about what it would be like to meet another version of yourself. Decisions are made that could produce a personality completely different from your own. This is by no means a new idea, but in this case the writer treats it with great wit and humour. Certain ideas and scenes in the novel are based on things that happened in the TV series, but it has all been rearranged and augmented. This is where print can achieve what a limited TV budget can't.<br />This is science fiction writing at its most humorous. Irreverent, zany and wild.	2003-08-12

It's a fair question. You may even own the video tapes. But imagine this nightmare scenario: <br />You're sitting at home watching your favourite \\"Red Dwarf\\" episode, laughing along, when all of a sudden a power blackout leaves you sitting in the dark. \\"What am I going to do?\\" you cry in despair. \\"What's going to make me laugh now?\\" Tears begin to flow.<br />However, in a parallel universe there is another version of you who happens to own a copy of the \\"Red Dwarf\\" scripts: Primordial Soup. All is not lost. With a copy of the scripts and the aid of a torch you can simply pick up from where the characters were cut off in mid-sentence. The book even contains photographs in the middle section to help you remember what the characters look like. Life isn't so cruel after all. <br />In this book Rob Grant and Doug Naylor have chosen what they consider to be \\"the least worst\\" of the \\"Red Dwarf\\" scripts. There are six episodes altogether: \\"Polymorph\\", \\"Marooned\\", \\"Dimension Jump\\" (my favourite), \\"Justice\\", \\"Back to Reality\\" and \\"Psirens\\". <br />It doesn't need to be said that the ideas used in \\"Red Dwarf\\" are clever and funny. The episodes chosen here are from the first five years of \\"Red Dwarf\\", before the budget became too extravagant, making it possible for these episodes to be \\"remastered\\". You can read these scripts and still laugh while your other self discovers there are no batteries for the torch either. Enjoy the lunacy.	2003-07-21
US	50780673	R2D3AMC15T0NSC	B00005WJS3	581801822	The outward urge	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Family Connections	In \\"The Outward Urge\\" (1959) John Wyndham writes, along with his alter ego Lucas Parkes, a story describing four generations of a British, space-faring family - the Troons. The title of the book refers to a compulsion felt by this family to leave Earth and head for the stars. In their eyes there is a destiny to be fulfilled: to spread out and conquer ever-widening reaches of space.<br />The first chapter takes place in 1994, when the first space station is being built and mankind is yet to claim the Moon. (Wyndham never dreamed there would be footprints on the Moon just four months after his death.) The rivalry between the United States and the Soviets is intense. Britain is somewhat neutral. Ticker Troon, 24, is taking part in the construction of the space station when the project is almost sabotaged by an unknown, wandering missile. Ticker's bravery saves the lives of his fellows and the project but he never sees his new-born son Michael...<br />Fifty years later Michael Troon is the commander of a British station on the Moon. On Earth the northern hemisphere is being pounded in a nuclear bombardment. The extent of the damage can only be guessed at but casualties are known to be in the millions. Shocking statistics for a war that has only been going for ten days. Much of the northern hemisphere is reduced to ash.<br />After the Great Northern War countries of importance are now in the southern hemisphere. The strongest of these is Brazil. In 2094 Geoffery Trunho, the first man on Mars, becomes stranded after a misadventure with the landing module. He writes an account of what happened, in the hope that someone will find it one day. From his description, Mars is a dreary, desolate place to be marooned.<br />By 2144, Australians have landed on Venus. (One of the Troons became an Australian citizen.) This causes something of an uproar among the Brazilians, who consider space to be their province. It looks as if their monopoly of space is being challenged and plans are made to save face. Will Australia and Brazil come to blows?<br />At the time \\"The Outward Urge\\" was written space travel was still a dream. The best views of space were in the paintings of Chesley Bonestell, even though they were fanciful. Lucas Parkes wrote the parts of the story detailing the science (such as it was then), in an effort to make the book more believable. In the end you can't help but agree with the Troons - space needs to be colonized, and soon. In the event of an apocalyptic meteor smashing into the Earth it would be comforting to know that other planets are populated. The human race needn't become extinct.	2003-06-29

I was impressed by the level of detail in the illustrations: walls of a ruined house that seemed to include every brick; gleaming metal; meticulously rendered grass; the folds in a white tunic; an alien city glittering with light. These covers, almost photographic in appearance, were done before the illustrator had an electronic alternative to acrylics.<br />Nearly twenty years later, much of Fred Gambino's output is produced with the aid of the Apple Macintosh. Apparently, Gambino was one of the first SF artists to explore the potential of computer-generated illustration. It proved to be a revelation for him. Nearly all the artwork in \\"Ground Zero\\" is computer-generated. Gambino describes the process in detail, sifting through a diverse range of reference material, building with polygons, turning photographs of ordinary people into out of-this-world heroes (or villains). On a couple of occasions Gambino has even used photographs of himself. We see him as a priest on the cover of \\"A Case of Conscience\\". Gambino points out with wry humour that the photo was old, taken at a time when he had hair. The cover illustration also includes a \\"lizard man\\" in the background, which wasn't shown in the final printed version. The art director told Gambino to remove it. When using a computer, that's no problem at all.<br />Fred Gambino has had prestigious commissions, producing work for such well-known writers as Brian Aldiss, Frank Herbert and David Brin. Many of Gambino's covers are part of the growing library of SF Masterworks. Some of these are also included in \\"Ground Zero\\".<br />The computer-generated imagery is very slick, crisp and clean-looking. Other artists have expressed concern with the over-reliance on computers, but this doesn't seem to bother Fred Gambino. He hasn't abandoned traditional media altogether, but there are plenty of advantages to working electronically, such as retouching images in a matter of moments, recycling reference photo's and so on. A lot of time and labour is saved. The computer still hasn't eliminated the need for good drawing skills.<br />\\"Ground Zero\\" is an amazing collection of work. It would be good if another collection of Fred Gambino's earlier hand-done work was produced. It would certainly be a contrast.	2003-06-05

We often wonder what our lives would have been like if we had done something differently, if this event had or hadn't happened. This is a fascinating concept to consider. It's like those old \\"Choose Your Own Adventure\\" books. (\\"If you decide to do this turn to page 112, if you decide to do that turn to page 119\\".) There is a different outcome depending on which page you turn to. <br />The kind of life we have in this world could be completely different in another reality. If we let ourselves believe this idea it makes us more accepting of the fact that life deals hard knocks to some people while others, perhaps undeservedley, prosper. A superstar in this reality could be a complete nobody in another. Everything rests on vital decisions. <br />After a nuclear war in 1998, 21st century Scotland is one of the few places in the world where human beings still exist. (Tasmania is another, apparently.) In this society it has become customary for people walking outdoors to wear radiation suits, not to protect them from fallout (the suits are ineffective for this purpose), but to hide whatever deformities they may have. The number of birth defects is high, as is the suicide rate. Like most stories set after the holocaust, life is not as enjoyable as it used to be.<br />This scenario serves as a backdrop for the story itself. After a close shave with death, Peter Gilchrist becomes something of a messiah figure after he founds a new cult based on the belief in alternative realities. This is partly inspired by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1793). We know that in our reality Mozart died in 1791. Gilchrist's teachings amount to the idea that we don't have to be held responsible for our actions. This has some rather disturbing consequences.<br />The alternative reality is an interesting angle for a post-holocaust book. This is a neat way of preventing \\"Time-Slip\\" from being a Cold War relic. For all we know, the Earth could have been devastated in another dimension. Perhaps civilization was destroyed in October 1962 and 2003 is now the equivalent of medieval times. On the other hand, maybe Mars is already colonised. The concept of alternative realities makes us consider how lucky (or unlucky) we are.	2003-05-24

Scott has been surviving in the basement, a hostile, Dali-esque environment where the only neighbour is a menacing black widow spider. Like all people troubled by the miseries of the present, Scott's mind frequently turns back to the past. These flashbacks chart the course of Scott's diminishing height, beginning with the anger and humiliation of total dependence, the loneliness of being a national spectacle, and the inexorable retreat into a nightmare world.<br />\\"The Shrinking Man\\" has much in common with \\"I Am Legend\\". We have the lone protagonist, an outcast, cut off and isolated from everything that was once safe and familiar. Both characters are trapped in their respective predicaments, virtual prisoners with no hope of reprieve. Like Robert Neville, Scott Carey also had a wife and daughter. While Robert's family succumbed to a plague of vampirism, Scott's family seemed to be turning into \\"giants\\". Robert Neville was armed with a wooden stake, hoping to kill his tormentor Ben Cortman - Scott is armed with a sewing pin, hoping to dispatch the persistent spider.<br />Scott's dimunition is constant. He is literally going where no man has gone before. Eventually he'll be able to see germs without a microscope, and perhaps see what atoms really look like. Maybe he'll even be able to see the miniature solar systems inside them. Didn't William Blake say something about the universe being a grain of sand?<br />In the film adaptation of \\"A Stir of Echoes\\" the babysitter reads a copy of \\"The Shrinking Man\\" - a little in-joke on the script writer's part. It's easy to see how Stephen King was influenced by Matheson's work, particularly in books like \\"Salem's Lot\\" or \\"Thinner\\". There really is no such thing as originality. Everything comes from something else.It's just a matter of good story-telling.	2003-05-04

This encyclopedia is very similar to John Clute's \\"SF: The Illustrated Encylcopedia\\" (1995), but not quite as packed with information. (I bought David Pringle's version first. I found John Clute's version two years later.) I think this book gives a more detailed account of film and TV than John Clute's one, but less about the works of the writers and the social/political issues that influenced them. <br />Like John Clute's book, we get an informed, thorough description of science fiction's beginnings, which go back quite a few centuries, as well as an overview of the various sub-categories that fall within the overall genre (space opera, disasters, alternative histories, time travel, nuclear war, etc). A list of the most memorable books within each category is also mentioned. <br />Seven decades of science fiction cinema are covered (up to 1995), along with television shows, many that are well-known, some a bit more obscure. Biographies of writers and film makers are included. These are understandably brief, due to the limited amount of space within the book's 300 pages. But to compensate for this we get a list of famous heroes and villains, including Alex from \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", Batman, Spiderman, Superman, Dan Dare and the Mekon. Don't forget the Daleks.<br />David Pringle's book has plenty of illustrations and photographs with witty captions, an exhaustive list of reading material to go through and a useful glossary. For anyone new to science fiction, this book is a very good place to start.	2003-05-02

This is to strengthen the network of resistance against the evil tenacity of the fl'eyes.  In the course of their duties it isn't long before the SunBirds are faced with yet another challenge.<br />Following a rash decision to reconnoitre a wasp nest, the SunBirds find themselves held captive by the nest's insect inhabitants, ruled by the power-mad Queen Vigora - the one who is co-ordinating the scheme to seize control of the Earth.<br />It's a close call, but the SunBirds manage to escape with an  important piece of information. The fl'eyes plan to gain more unwilling recruits for their army using the plentiful supply of matter on offer at a bird auction - a place where birds are at their most vulnerable, and therefore easy pickings. It's up to the SunBirds to find this auction and somehow keep the would-be invaders from increasing their numbers yet again.<br />Sapphire narrates this section of the tale. More level-headed than Aquarius and perhaps more cautious than Shadow, he and his comrades see a bit more of the world beyond the boundaries of Sunset Hills Farm, overcoming various crises on their journey to the auction. We also learn something more of Lava the pheasant's background. Despite his cheerful disposition, there lies a source of great bitterness in connection with the fl'eyes.<br />\\"Great Lengths\\" is another  book of adventure where cunning and mischief are just as important as strength and bravery when standing up to an implacable foe. The resourcefulness of the heroes is put to the test once again in a series of dangerous exploits. As the SunBirds have made clear, it's no easy job battling the forces of evil. In keeping with traditional fighting spirit, Sapphire says the words: \\"We'll never give up.\\" Spoken like a true hero.	2003-04-18

Having come to terms with their new roles, Aquarius, Shadow, Sapphire and the rest continue to aid the beetles in their ongoing efforts to thwart the fl'eyes. This time round, Shadow takes up the narrative, bringing us up to date with recent events, while putting her life at risk with an erratic Power Chip.<br />In this second instalment of the \\"SunBirds Series\\" our intrepid heroes are sent on a perilous quest. They have to enter the \\"pen\\" of their Raiser to obtain an important piece of equipment called a computer. The beetles need this for the memory chip, which is required for their communication devices. Things prove to be anything but straightforward for the SunBirds. Like Hercules going into Hades, the SunBirds face just as much danger, but on this occasion they have a bit of help from a high-spirited pheasant called Lava.<br />Trying to get the computer is not the only risk, however. The fl'eyes are an ever-present menace, having concocted a virulent disease that threatens the survival of the SunBirds as well as the beetles.<br />\\"Epidemic\\" is a strong continuation to \\"Beginnings\\", highlighted by acts of courage, daring, and downright recklessness. It is good that we are seeing things from the perspective of Shadow instead of Aquarius this time, for it means we get an account that is more rounded; the story is not confined to one narrator's point of view.<br />Meanwhile, the fight against the fl'eyes goes on.

If you've seen Magritte's paintings you'll know what I mean. I feel \\"SunBirds\\" conveys a similar spirit in its writing.<br />In this first book of the \\"SunBirds Series\\" we humans are reminded that there is indeed more going on than meets the eye. In our complacency we overlook what is really happening, blissfully unaware that seemingly humble creatures, far more intelligent than we realize, are secretly plotting, planning and scheming against us. Preparations for our overthrow are being made by the insidious \\"fl'eyes\\". Can they be stopped? Or will this growing army succeed in its plans for world domination? <br />Our future is in the hands (or should that be claws?) of a group of birds. These birds had been raised on a farm and have now been persuaded by the beetles to join them in a fight against the fl'eyes.<br />This is a cleverly thought out fantasy story for children that is humorous, touching and involving. The ideas are clearly explained and easy to follow, the story moves from event to event at a pace that is comfortably brisk. I dare say the book is comparable to anything by Roald Dahl. Although the humour probably isn't as dark as Dahl's.<br />It would be interesting to know A.A. Browne's influences. Who would his favourite authors be?

This is largely due to such depressingly self-evident phrases as &quot;life's too short&quot; or &quot;you're only young once&quot;. But what if we had more time? <br />Francis Saxover, a respected biochemist, discovers a way to slow the ageing process, making it possible to live a couple of extra centuries. With a discovery of this magnitude, there are bound to be far-reaching implications, and Saxover tries to keep the miraculous cure (which he calls Antigerone) under wraps. Because the supply of Antigerone is limited, it's a question of deciding who gets the treatment. Who would use the time most wisely?<br />The benefits of most scientific advances are usually limited to the rich at first. But this changes over time. &quot;Trouble With Lichen&quot; is a satirical novel which poses some questions on the pros and cons of an increased lifespan. One obvious con is overpopulation. As we know, Earth is a planet of finite resources, a planet overburdened by an immature species contending with famine, disease and habitual war. At first, Antigerone is unlikely to alleviate this problem. On the other hand, if Antigerone did become widely available and people could live longer, they wouldn't feel the pressure to marry and have children as quickly as they do now, in order to pass on the family name. In fact, one could put off starting a family until they're in their early nineties. What about the rise in umemployment as people take longer to retire? One possible way around this would be to make people stay in school longer. At the moment twelve years is scarcely adequate for a full, comprehensive education. The learning process would be far less stressful if it wasn't so rushed. Can you imagine starting high school at fifty? <br />It would be nice to think that the longer we live the more wisdom we would gain. The pace through life would be much more leisurely and happy,not fraught with a feeling of dashed hopes and time slipping by.  <br />It might have been interesting  to actually see how the characters' lives unfold over the next two hundred years or so. But Wyndham leaves this to conjecture, which is a bit of a pity. Nevertheless &quot;Trouble With Lichen&quot; is certainly thought-provoking.	2003-03-17

A Thayer and Chandler model. As a naive teenager, I was so eager to get stuck in, I didn't realize the paint was supposed to be diluted into liquid form first. Much to my frustration, nothing happened. That was before I bought this book, succinctly titled &quot;Airbrush Painting&quot;. <br />Like most books about art technique, &quot;Airbrush Painting&quot;  (1988)starts off with a list of materials and equipment, the tools of the trade employed by both fine artists and illustrators. This is followed by diagrams, troubleshooting and step by step projects, before finishing up with a gallery of work by the professionals, all of which are guaranteed to awe the novice. Out of the list at the back, Chris Moore was the only name I recognized.<br />Most people will agree that the airbrush is an intimidating tool at first, but this book explains a lot about it in easy-to-understand language. In fact &quot;Airbrush Painting&quot; is very similar to another book I own called &quot;Creative Airbrushing&quot; by Graham Duckett. Both covers show a hand holding the airbrush over a piece of highly finished artwork. In fact, the books are almost identical in content and format. <br />Despite the advances in desktop publishing, I like to think that  airbrushing is not old hat. Airbrushing is a useful skill to have when the computer breaks down. In the past people have expressed reservations about the airbrush, believing that it's a form of &quot;cheating&quot;. I find this amusing.  Like all technology, the airbrush is meant to help the artist complete the job quickly and more efficiently. It makes life easier. Is it cheating when a farmer uses a tractor instead of a plough? <br />Just as the car hasn't stopped people riding horses, the computer hasn't  stopped artists using the airbrush. The technique (which dates back to the time of cavemen) is just as popular today. Whether you're an artist or an illustrator, &quot;Airbrush Painting&quot; is a valuable book to have.	2003-03-05
US	50780673	R26E3DHBQHWQ01	1587156040	930950913	The Night Land	Books	3	13	15	N	N	Dark Future	Disgruntled English students usually think they are suffering when they are made to read William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\". They say the symbolism is too confusing, too hard to understand etc. But that book is a walk in the park compared to \\"The Night Land\\". It is no exaggeration to say that, unless one is prepared to make an effort, reading this book can be exquisitely painful. In order to avoid getting a headache I was obliged to read in short bursts, or until the words started spinning in front of my eyes. <br />The writing of \\"The Night Land\\" is the deepest shade of purple prose imaginable. Exceedingly dense, flowery, and, in some parts, almost indecipherable. Curiously, I still wanted to finish it. Despite the critic's warnings, I couldn't resist the story: the remaining inhabitants of Earth (a handful of millions) surviving in a future that has long been dark, desolate and hostile since the death of the sun. A cordon of lumbering, monolithic creatures inching their way toward the Last Redoubt, where the humans are sheltered. <br />While reading \\"The Night Land\\" I was, to a certain extent, reminded of Camille Flammarion's \\"Omega: the Last Days of the World\\" (1893). Both books are fairly bleak visions presenting an Earth disturbingly changed by the aeons. Both have an element of Victorian-era romance where the heroes set out and eventually find their Intended Ones. \\"Omega\\" is far more easy to comprehend, however. It gradually eases the reader into the remote future, preparing him or her for the shock of change. \\"The Night Land\\" cuts right to the chase. The narrator, a grieving widow in the first chapter, \\"awakes\\" in the future with a different body, completely familiar with his surroundings, looking on his past life like a vaguely remembered dream.<br />Like other readers, I would have enjoyed the book more if it weren't for the language. There did seem a bit too much padding and a frustrating sense of going round in circles. The romance can only be described as mawkish. Hodgson does do a good job at evoking a feeling of dislocation though. Making the future look confusing and bewildering to outsiders like ourselves. If you want to read a book that plays with language, I would like to suggest \\"Riddley Walker\\" by Russell Hoban. It's only set a few thousand years from now, but it does evoke the feeling of another era through language  more convincingly than Hodgson's attempt.	2003-02-03

I also own the other two, &quot;The Science Fiction and Fantasy World of Tim White&quot; and &quot;Mirror of Dreams&quot;. &quot;Chiaroscuro&quot; is almost like an amalgamation of the two earlier books, but a few more works have been added. (And some ommitted.) <br />Tim White's style is certainly distinctive. It's amazing what this man can do with gouache - not as easy a medium to handle as acrylic, there's a lot more risk involved - and the airbrush. His pen and ink drawings show a high level of skill too. The book also includes more of White's preliminary roughs, done with markers, which show the development of an idea before the final work is produced.  <br />The illustrations are stunning. I once bought a second-hand copy of J.G. Ballard's &quot;Hello America&quot; because Tim White had done the cover. It showed a ruinous Chrysler Building rising out of the desert sand, with a snake writhing in the foreground. Unfortunately, I couldn't get into the book itself. I bought the novel before I found &quot;Chiaroscuro&quot;. That cover illustration is included in this collection, without the author's name and title obscuring it. Tim White is also one of many artists who has done a cover for William Gibson's &quot;Neuromancer&quot;.<br />What seems to be evident in these works is a love of nature. The landscapes are meticulously rendered, and often include every blade of grass and every grain of sand, providing a super-realistic background for aliens, humans, faeries and goblins. Among my favourite pieces are those done for the H.P. Lovecraft books. Even though they are horror works, there seems to be a dark, morbid humour about them. <br />It would be reasonable to say Tim White's work is on a par with that of Jim Burns, another British illustrator. Tim White's illustrations are an inspiration to me.	2003-01-04

Five stories dealing with space travel, time travel, aliens and superweapons. These were written before  we knew what we know now about our solar system. Published in a time that seemed more innocent, when Britain was the strongest nation in the world, when it was taken for granted that humans would walk on other planets before the end of the twentieth century.<br />The first story, \\"Sleepers of Mars\\", is a sequel of sorts to \\"Stowaway to Mars\\", dealing with different characters. Those who have read \\"Stowaway to Mars\\" will know that the action takes place in 1981. \\"Sleepers of Mars\\" is set just after the British rocket heads back to Earth, while the Russian team, who were in competition with the British, are stranded. Like many other stories about Mars, it mentions the canals that were thought to exist there.<br />\\"Invisible Monster\\", is like a vague prototype of the film \\"Predator\\", with an invisible alien creature that feeds on anything that strays into its path. The growing creature was brought back to Earth after a returning explorer ship crashed in a forest. <br />\\"Worlds to Barter\\" is a story in which the future makes contact with the past/present. A matter of us swapping places (and times) with the highly evolved descendents who live in an Earth in decline.<br />\\"The Man From Earth\\" is a fairly standard story of a man kept in a zoo on Venus. He warns the Venusians not to accept the overtures of the destructive, self-serving species he represents,unaware that he is the last human in the universe. <br />\\"The Third Vibrator\\", my personal favourite, offers an explanation of how two lost civilizations, Lemuria and Atlantis, were destroyed by a weapon of unimaginable power. This weapon (with the rather unfortunate name \\"vibrator\\") can turn miles of land into desert. Atlantis was once a mighty, technologically advanced civilization that passed into legend after its total destruction. The same danger faces 20th century civilization when the weapon is built again by the scientist who had destroyed  the two other civilizations in his previous lives. This story was written nineteen years before the hydrogen bomb came into being (for the first time?)<br />These stories, written by a man best remembered for destroying civilization with blinding comets and triffid seed, are quite clever in a charming sort of way. Light, easy reading.	2002-12-29
US	50780673	R2Z6VNSEUTG0TK	0718111982	770396150	The Secret People	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Kept in the Dark	I'm always finding a John Wyndham novel I haven't read before. And yes, I did find this in a used book store. This was John Wyndham's first novel, originally serialized in a magazine, written when he went by the name John Beynon.<br />Published in 1935 but set in 1964, \\"The Secret People\\" takes us to a place intruders never leave. After Mark Sunnet's rocket plane crashes in the Sahara Desert, which is being turned into a \\"New Sea\\" by France and Italy in a monumental feat of engineering, he and his girlfriend Margaret find themselves prisoners of a people determined to keep their existence secret. Hence the title of this book.<br />These short-statured people (who resemble white pygmies) dwell in an underground network of vast caves and are, on the face of it, mired in primitivism. The caves are lit by luminous globes of unknown power, suggesting that this civilization was once highly developed technologically but is now long past its time of glory. While Margaret and her cat become a focus of worship, Mark is thrown in with the other prisoners. These are people of various nationalities who were unfortunate enough to stray into the pygmie's domain over the years - destined to live out their lives subsisting on the fungus of giant mushrooms which grow in the caves. While many are slumped in apathy, some of the captives have preserved their sanity by working on an escape tunnel. The rising water levels have heightened the sense of urgency.<br />Because Wyndham was a fan of H.G. Wells, it is reasonable to guess he had read \\"In the Abyss\\", a story with a similar theme. The characters are an ever-resourceful set, which, apart from Mark and Margaret, include a couple of can-do Americans to boost morale, an English academic speculating on the history of the pygmies, a slimy villain, a good-natured African giant, and, to represent the pygmies, a philosophical priest. Wyndham's style in the 1930s is different to his more acclaimed style of the 1950s, but it remains readable today, even if it is a little dated.	2002-11-20

Hardy (Paper Tiger)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	The Future and Beyond	One issue that I grapple with frequently is the difference between &quot;art&quot; and &quot;illustration&quot;. In the world of fine art illustrators are generally looked on as an inferior breed by the critics. In his introduction to &quot;Hardyware&quot; David A. Hardy expresses his reproof at modern art's derision of anything beautiful or representational. <br />This got me thinking. If SF art is &quot;mere illustration&quot; as an  art critic would say, what about all those historical paintings of heaven and hell, the last judgement and armageddon? Critics seem to love those. <br />But I digress. SF art does have its place, and it plays an important role. The main body of &quot;Hardyware&quot; gives us a glimpse of the possibilties that await us in the future. If things turn out properly and we don't destroy ourselves, our descendents will become great builders with the potential to conquer the stars. Most of the artwork in this collection is done in gouache and acrylic, although more recently the artist has turned to digital media. <br />We see visions of the past as well as the future. One of my favourite pieces is a scene from &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. I remember seeing that image on a  cover jacket when I was 12, although I didn't know who the artist was back then. The image of a dinosaur looking up at a descending asteroid is hauntingly grim. <br />I often think SF artists are underrated. Though they are often proved wrong, their visions provide a valuable contribution to the development of our civilization, giving inspiration to those who have the ability to make fantasy a reality.	2002-07-23
US	50780673	R3MSXT9LXO379V	1857988078	1396600	Star Maker (SF Masterworks)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Across the Universe	\\"Who are we?\\", \\"Why are we here?\\" and \\"What's it all for?\\" are questions most of us have probably asked at some point, whether we're going through times of doubt, uncertainty or philosophical musing. Destiny and fate are fuzzy topics that make for deep intellectual discussion, providing much stimulation and irritation for those who like to ponder such matters. \\"Star Maker\\" attempts to answer the above questions by taking the reader on an epic voyage spanning the cosmos.<br />The human protagonist becomes a disembodied psychic presence travelling across the immense gulf of space and time, visiting numerous worlds, some of which, like Earth, spawn conflicting cultures and religions. We see evolving star systems and witness the birth and death of countless species before  meeting the creator of it all, the enigmatic Star Maker.<br />On our own miniscule speck of a planet (where the book begins) we go about our daily business, struggling to make sense of a senseless existence, living in a world that seems to punish the innocent and reward the wicked. As we soon discover, it's like this throughout the universe. We witness acts of barbarism and atrocity, noble races are wiped out, unwilling (even if able) to defend themselves against less civilised, but no less talented aggressors. Other worlds are simply destroyed by freak twists of fate. All this is of complete indifference to the Star Maker. (How many of us feel grief when we accidentally step on a bug?)<br />On meeting the Star Maker we find that our cosmos is merely one of a series of artistic experiments churned out over the aeons, as the Star Maker strives to create something that meets his satisfaction. Like any artist on an endless quest for perfection, he has to go through several failures in his \\"immature\\" phase. Our cosmos is produced in his \\"mature\\" phase. Yet it still fails to satisfy him, and even stranger, more incomprehensible creations are brought into being.<br />I suspect John Wyndham got his inspiration for \\"Chocky\\" from reading this book, the way the narrator becomes an observer who can inhabit the minds of various hosts. I know Wyndham had read \\"Odd John\\". In \\"Star Maker\\" there's a lot to take in, even the narrator had trouble understanding a lot of it. 100 billion years of birth and death, hope and despair, good and evil are covered in 253 pages. I read \\"Last and First Men\\" two years ago. Even though \\"Star Maker\\" is an interesting book which I finished more quickly, I still prefer the former.	2002-07-18

We saw a video about him in my art class at school back in 1992. All the kids looked pretty impressed, I certainly was. The film showed the way Wilks produces his pictures. We saw his studio in the Pyrenees mountains, an obsessively clean, sparkling white room, where the artist works in complete silence. The video made it quite clear that Wilks is a perfectionist, treating every image with the utmost care.<br />I finally bought &quot;The Annotated Ultimate Alphabet&quot; about five years after seeing the video. The quality of the artwork is incredible, there aren't many books like this around. Not only is this book entertaining, it is useful as well. Apparently Mike Wilks was influenced by Salvador Dali, but I think he is better than that. My favourite page is the letter &quot;S&quot;, a room filled with more than 1000 objects beginning with that letter. I still can't name everything.<br />There are all kinds of objects in this book, ranging from the very common, to the really obscure. Some things are instantly recognisable, others will leave you completely baffled. It would be no exaggeration to say that anyone who reads this book and absorbs it fully will become an excellent Scrabble player.<br />In these images Mike Wilks demonstrates exeptional ability, particularly with the airbrush. Here we see draftsmanship of the highest order, just about every member of the animal kingdom is represented accurately. Pen and ink drawings  accompany the word lists, giving additional nourishment to a growing vocabulary.   <br />This book gives new meaning to that phrase about a picture saying a thousand words.	2002-07-15

How this will happen exactly is a matter of speculation. Among the thinkers of this 25th century society debate rages over whether we will burn, freeze, suffocate or drown. It just so happens that the human race survives, and the end of the world, eagerly awaited throughout history, is postponed yet again.<br />The Earth goes on to become an ancient planet, undergoing all manner of metamorphoses, spawning countless civilizations which flourish and die. Over millions of years physical and mental changes ensure humanity evolves into a species far superior to its hopelessly inadequate ancestors before passing away, leaving the Earth a barren husk studded with the ruins of an earlier age. While we are burdened with the knowledge that all things pass, we take comfort in knowing that creation is neverending.<br />The illustrations in \\"Omega\\" are good, though a couple are vaguely amusing. One can't help grinning at the fleet of aircraft that resemble flying sail boats. I suppose people in the 25th century will feel the same way when they look back at the SF illustrations done in the late twentieth. Maybe \\"Omega\\" would seem less dated without the illustrations, although some of the science described in the writing is also inaccurate. No matter. As Einstein once said, imagination is more important than knowledge, and this book is without question imaginitive. <br />If \\"Omega\\" hadn't been written where would Olaf Stapledon have got his inspiration for \\"Last and First Men\\"? It's always ironic when a \\"groundbreaking\\" work gets its inspiration from an earlier, more obscure source; just as an inventor gets the credit for someone else's idea, so too an original novel lies forgotten in the wake of its more popular successor. Until now.<br />\\"Omega\\" is an interesting book, although it probably won't become compulsory reading for English students. It might seema bit deep for those looking for a gripping story with interesting characters. In terms of scope and vision, \\"Omega\\" is in the same class as anything written by H.G. Wells.	2002-07-14

Wells which chronicles the end of civilization by atomic weapons. Like the alien invader theme (also pioneered by Wells), this premise has been used to death in countless books and films and reduced to cliche, but in 1914, when the novel was first published, the idea was completely new. Thirty-one years before Hiroshima and Nagasaki, H.G. Wells wrote the first novel about the effects of nuclear war.<br />This edition of \\"The Last War\\" contains an informative introduction by Greg Bear, describing the social conditions that led to the book's publication, and a lot of background information about Wells himself. <br />It could be said that \\"The Last War\\" is one of the only books where nuclear war proves to be a positive experience. Society is swept away, purged by fire, and a new civilization rises from the ashes of the old. This all happens in a relatively short time. Wells would use this theme again in \\"The Shape of Things To Come\\" (1933).<br />\\"The Last War\\" is notable for its prophetic qualities (never mind that the atomic bombs are thrown by hand), but in parts the book can be rather dry. The story doesn't move at the same pace as \\"The War of the Worlds\\" or \\"The Time Machine\\", for example. Since the end of World War Two and the beginning of the Cold War, the glut of post-nuclear scenarios that followed have been more willing to portray the  full horror that such a conflict would bring. In \\"The Last War\\" there is a feeling of detatchment, the sense one gets from reading a history book. The book deals more with events than characters.<br />In summing up, H.G. Wells had no idea he was starting a genre that would become popular for years to come. The post-nuclear world is a place  many writers have liked to visit and describe in detail. Wells saw it first.	2002-07-01

Richard Jefferies describes in great detail a world of the far future in which the wonders of our own civilization are mostly forgotten, or seen as fables. (Until Heinrich Schliemann dug up the ruins, the city of Troy was a legend also. Can we be certain that Atlantis was a legend?) <br />Much of England is covered in forests, the relics of our own civilization buried under thickets and shrubbery. London, once a centre of culture and trade, is long gone. Society has become medieval once more. Skills like reading and writing have been preserved, but these are forbidden to all but the nobles. Slavery is common and wars between cities are frequent. <br />It is almost certain that John Christopher has read this book. If you read the \\"Tripods\\" trilogy and the \\"Prince in Waiting\\" trilogy, you will see certain similarities. <br />In many of the post-technological stories I've read the one invention of ours that gets mentioned the most is the railroad, possibly because it helped us conquer the tyranny of distance, and made the world more accessible. In the early pages of \\"After London\\" the railroad is mentioned, though not by name, and references are made regarding our ability to communicate over a great distance with wires.<br />The main character in \\"After London\\" is 25-year old Felix, a sensitive character living in a world that has no place for sensitivity. Often ridiculed for his interest in learning rather than war and hunting, Felix carries out a plan to strike out on his own by embarking on a journey of discovery. Eventually Felix does  make something of himself and greatness is thrust upon him. <br />A barbarous future is often imagined for us after a nuclear war or some other cataclysm, but in \\"After London\\" the cause of our decline is obscure and hazy. We can't be certain that the society in \\"After London\\" will eventually reach the heights from which it had fallen. Most of our inventions,like the light bulb and penicillin, were accidents. There was an ancient civilization that could produce metal of a better quality than we can produce now, but the skill is lost.<br />\\"After London\\" is a very descriptive novel with minimal dialogue. It is more concerned with the world it portrays than the characters who inhabit it. This is a pivotal work in the post-holocaust genre.	2002-06-17

It sounded like an exciting story but there was one problem: two pages were missing, including the last one. A short time later the out-of-print book disappeared. I spent the next thirteen years looking for it and have just read a brand new edition. It was worth waiting for.<br />Similar in style to \\"The Death of Grass\\" (1956), \\"A Wrinkle In the Skin\\" (1965) reads like an after-the-bomb story without the radiation. In this book the collapse of civilization is quite literal.<br />Massive earthquakes have brought a sudden end to modern society. Towns and cities have been completely destroyed, the twisted landscape strewn with rubble and unburied corpses. Very few made it through the devastation alive. The disaster has left its survivors reduced to the level of scavengers, digging among the ruins for food, wary of strangers, fearful of desperate marauders.<br />Things are unstable in more ways than one. While earth tremors continue to shake the survivors, recent events have unhinged those who once lived normal lives in a world of law and order. Madness and violence are widespread. And these are only the early days of the aftermath. Nevertheless, a trace of decent behaviour still remains in some people. Against the rising tide of barbarism, they're  determined to live and gain some form of security that will enable them to start again.<br />Among all this horror, Matthew Cotter is trying to find his daughter Jane. As one would expect, it's a grim journey by foot across a ravaged land.<br />It's tempting to think of \\"A Wrinkle In the Skin\\" as a prequel to \\"The Prince in Waiting Trilogy\\". (In that story England is medievalised once more due to the destruction of civilization through earthquakes.) We can guess that life will be more primitive and harsh after \\"A Wrinkle In the Skin\\" finishes. Descendents of the survivors will inherit legends of former glory; the so-called \\"lost civilization\\" with its mysteries and wonders. Only time will tell whether future generations will rediscover all that was destroyed.	2002-03-10

A machine that replaced the humble horse, it provoked feelings of excitement, power, control, even love. There were people who gave them pet names and pampered them. As usual, people's standards change to suit the times. In a world ravaged by war, animals are a rarity, and therefore expensive. To own and care for a live animal, not a mechanical fake, is the goal of those who still live on Earth.<br />Rick Deckard lives with his wife in San Francisco. Large sections of this neglected city, like the rest of the world, are empty of people. Many have emigrated to colony planets like Mars to escape the radioactive pollution. Deckard's job is to eliminate (retire) androids. The androids are so life-like their identity can only be proved by a special \\"empathy test\\". Without this test it's impossible to tell who is real and who isn't. Androids supposedly have no empathy. Once they are caught out, they don't last long.<br />Deckard's latest contract is a lucarative one. He has to finish what a previous bounty hunter started, by killing six fugitive androids who concealed themselves among the human population of Northern California. Once the job is done, Deckard will have enough money to buy a real animal.<br />If \\"Blade Runner\\" hadn't been made a lot of people wouldn't have heard of this book. Although I haven't seen \\"Blade Runner\\", it was hard not to imagine Rick Deckard having the face and voice of Harrison Ford. The morality of killing something that seems to be alive makes an intriguing theme. I think a lot of writers since Philip K. Dick have explored this premise. In the SF comedy \\"Red Dwarf\\" androids are programmed to believe in \\"Silicon Heaven\\", an afterlife for dead technology. This makes the androids more accepting of death, the knowledge that they have to be terminated one day to make way for superior models. Many of us believe that after death we enter an afterlife of eternal paradise. Despite this, we do everything in our power to put it off for as long as possible. From the moment of birth we are slowly dying. Nothing can stop it, life gets shorter every second. The new androids in Philip K. Dick's novel have that same desire for self-preservation. But they're at the mercy of someone higher up, one who decides when they've had enough.<br />It looks as if my copy of \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" contains a misprint. In the first chapter of my copy the date is January 1992. Yet another copy indicates it's the 21st century. I thought things seemed a bit too advanced for the 1990s. This is the second novel I've read by Dick, the first being \\"Dr. Bloodmoney\\", another after-the-bomb story. I'm currently reading \\"The Man In the High Castle\\". A very good book so far.	2002-02-20

George Paxton is one of six survivors saved from the nuclear war. The evacuees are on a submarine heading for the Antarctic, where they will face trial by the \\"Unadmitted\\" - the would-have-been descendents of those killed by the holocaust. George had signed a sales contract for a survival suit that would have saved his four-year-old daughter. The contract indicated he would do nothing to stop any nuclear war that may take place in the near future.<br />A short time later George saw first-hand the results of a holocaust he did nothing to stop. The innocents mutilated by blast, fire and radiation; thousands of years of human progress literally gone within a flash. One of the unforeseen effects of the nuclear war is time distortion. While a day passes for George on the submarine, years elapse for the dwindling population trying to live in a post-holocaust world. A world devastated by the effects of nuclear winter, ultraviolet light, plague, mutation and sterility.<br />George and his fellow defendents then have to justify their motives for allowing the ultimate atrocity to occur. Guilty or not guilty?<br />There is a mountain of books out there dealing with the nuclear holocaust, but this novel still comes across as original, sad and witty. You do have to read the book with an open mind. It's like one of those weird French films. I can just imagine the French making a film of something like this, along the lines of \\"La Jetee\\" or \\"Le Dernier Combat\\". As a satire, this book is excellent. When you find out how the holocaust started, you won't know whether to laugh or cry. <br />It's ironic to think that our fates depend on the decisions we make. Our lives are in the hands of people we vote for. The decisions seem sensible at the time, but then they become regrettable. In the most harrowing way, this book deals with consequences that come from an abundance of bad decisions.	2002-02-07
US	50780673	R1OIKOD1BNCJ67	034530702X	462652600	Davy	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Ribald Reminiscing	Four centuries after the nuclear holocaust the United States are no longer united. What exists now are separate feudal countries who sporadically wage war against one another. Ruled by the ascetic doctrines of the Holy Murcan Church, society is deprived of technology, held in thrall by ignorance and fear. The holocaust still claims its victims with the high incidence of genetic mutations (\\"mues\\"), which must be killed on sight. The lack of hygiene and decent medical care also makes people susceptible to disease.<br />Red-headed Davy was born into this world and describes his life over the years, growing up as an ill-educated orphan, forced by the welfare system to work as a bond servant, until he runs away at 14, spending the next few years travelling with an assortment of wandering minstrels. Davy writes his account from an island in the Azores. He's one of a group of exiles who dared to question the teachings of the Church. Despite the improvement in his education, Davy's spirited writing is still riddled with slang.<br />Davy's world is so convincingly backward there were times when I forgot this book was set in the future. Another story people may be interested in is John Wyndham's novel \\"The Chrysalids\\" (1955). There are certain similarities between that book and \\"Davy\\". Like \\"Davy\\", \\"The Chrysalids\\" takes place in a post-holocaust world centuries hence, where life is strictly governed by the Church and mutants are treated as the spawn of the devil. The story is set around eastern Canada, not that far from the places mentioned in \\"Davy\\". Even the narrator's name is similar. (His name is David.) Although the character is not so preoccupied with sex and has less adventures than Davy, \\"The Chrysalids\\" is my personal preference; a book I read when I was 14. A lot of school kids hate it.<br />Overall, \\"Davy\\" is a light, easy read. I bought my copy second-hand, a 1976 edition, printed the year Edgar Pangborn died.	2002-01-23

Maybe I'm cynical, but whenever I see a story on the news about a lost dog that found its way home again, or the birth of a puppy, I tend to think &quot;So what? Couldn't the media find any real news?&quot; However, when I read &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, I found this to be a rather engaging story.<br />As everyone knows, it follows the adventures of Buck, a dog that used to enjoy a life of comfort, luxury and privilege. With the advent of the gold rush, this life is  snatched away from him when he is stolen, sold, and subjected to the punishing rigours of wild Alaska, where he becomes part of a team trained to pull a sled.<br />Buck has to adapt quickly to this new life of hardship. He soon comes to realize that brute strength is the only way to survive; the weak will suffer and perish. &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; is a story of atavism, which needn't apply just to dogs. If we look back at our remote cave-dwelling ancestors, we know that only the most brutal of them survived, because the world of those days was so harsh. Very few lived to be thirty. The sick were abandoned, the dead were eaten. If conditions emerged to make physical life harsh and brutal once more, we know that it would be back to survival of the fittest. Jack London echoed this idea in his later story &quot;The Scarlet Plague&quot; (1912).  London makes it quite easy to relate to the dog in &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;. One might also draw parallels to the treatment of the slaves, and the indignities they had to endure.<br />The first &quot;dog story&quot; I was exposed to as a child was Stephen King's &quot;Cujo&quot;, which would be the very antithesis of &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;. However, I do believe King was one of many writers influenced by the work of Jack London. His popularity endures to this day.	2001-12-31

One thing to be thankful for is that Warday is nothing like the all-out holocaust predicted to wipe out humanity. At first this makes the much-anticipated armageddon seem like a comparative non-event. The biggest killer after the nuclear war is not radiation. That's only part of it. Instead, it's the crippling effects of EMP, coupled with famine and disease and the lack of medical treatment for those put on triage. Over five years the death toll has climbed dramatically. <br />Although it proved to be the world's shortest conflict, the after-effects of Warday are more far-reaching and devastating than anyone could have guessed. Two survivors, Whitley Strieber and James Kunetka, unveil the facts about Warday, describing through interviews, polls and statistics how the war has changed so many lives.<br />If there ever is a nuclear conflict I think it will be small-scale and accidental like the one in this book. The number of false alarms over the years is frightening. Nuclear war could have broken out in 1979 because of a computer malfunction. It nearly fooled the American military into thinking the Russians had launched a nuclear attack on the United States. It turned out a practice tape for testing airforce personnel had been left on one of the backup computer tape drives. Before the mistake was found the Americans were poised to strike. In 1995 a Norweigen weather rocket caused the Russian nuclear command to think the U.S. had launched a pre-emptive nuclear strike. Boris Yeltsin was deciding whether or not to strike back. Luckily he chose not to and the &quot;misunderstanding&quot; was cleared up.<br />I once saw some photographs of the Russian city Pripyat, which was evacuated shortly after the Chernobyl disaster. It looked just the same as Whitley Strieber's description of the abandoned New York - empty, crumbling and overgrown with vegetation. Pripyat was evacuated nearly 16 years ago and will remain uninhabitable for decades. This makes the writing in &quot;Warday&quot; seem eerily prophetic.<br />&quot;Warday&quot; is certainly among the best of the anti-nuclear warnings. Especially with all that recent talk about a missile defence shield.	2001-12-17

Hodge Backmaker is a country boy with less practical skills than his fellows; someone more at home with books than the outdoor, workaday environment.<br />In &quot;Bring the Jubilee&quot; Backmaker recounts his life, describing his move from Wappinger Falls to a squalid New York, where he works in a book shop for a few years. After some uncomfortable dealings with an underground army he then becomes involved with the intellectual thinktank at Haggershaven, where his fascination for history eventually leads to academic prestige.<br />Ward Moore has written an interesting scenario here. Along with the rewrite of American history, passing references are made to men like Carl Jung and Picasso, their destinies skewed by the differences that make alternate worlds possible. While taking part in the first experiments in time travel, Hodge Backmaker will unwittingly change their lives when he makes a field trip to Gettysburg in 1863...<br />There's no doubt that alternate histories are a fascinating subject for writers to tackle. So many of them have fun changing history, usually making our world look like the better one. Maybe it helps us forget the reality of our own problems; taking solace in the fact that there's always someone worse off than ourselves. A number of people have compared &quot;Bring the Jubilee&quot; with &quot;Pavane&quot;, the praise for both books being fairly equal. It's hard to say which is better, since they deal with two different periods of history. Like most novels, they both have their share of romance, which almost seems a requirement for the protagonist. Nevertheless, they both come highly recommended.	2001-11-18
US	50780673	R15Q7EGFLYH4II	0706608461	574969762	Greybeard	Books	5	18	20	N	N	Ageing Population	It was a book of Tim White's fantasy art that led me to &quot;Greybeard&quot;. An illustration of an abandoned town, weeds sprouting from cracks in the road, half-ruined buildings covered in ivy - a scene typical of the post-disaster genre. I was intrigued by the premise behind it.<br />The explosion of radioactive weapons in space has disrupted Earth's protective van Allen Belt, saturating the planet with massive doses of radiation. This has resulted in sickness, deformity and sterility for the human race. In the years following the &quot;Accident&quot; civilization has been in steady decline, as there will be no more future generations.<br />Algernon Timberlane (better known as Greybeard) was six years old at the time of the disaster. He has grown up in a world that has become increasingly primitive and quiet as people succumb to old age or cancers caused by the fallout. By the time Greybeard is in his mid fifties he is one of the youngest people left in the world. England has become a wilderness thinly populated by tribes of old people living with untreatable ailments. Savage animals, no longer afraid of man, roam the countryside in packs. Some people claim to have seen goblins lurking in the shadows. With each passing year people grow more frail and feeble-minded.<br />This is the first novel I've read by Brian Aldiss, the man who identified John Wyndham with the &quot;Cosy Catastrophe&quot;. &quot;Greybeard&quot; is a novel John Wyndham would certainly have approved of. The catastrophe that shaped this decrepit future is, however, far from cosy. A book like &quot;Greybeard&quot; would be a good way to argue in favour of the need for human cloning. It could well save our species.	2001-11-13

That is the question alternate history novels ask, when a single event can make all the difference. &quot;Pavane&quot; is the sort of book I imagine John Christopher would like. He once said he preferred the past to the future, which is why a couple of his juvenile-oriented stories have been set in post-technological futures; societies that are oppressed and primitive, as seen in the medieval &quot;Prince in Waiting&quot;(1970), where knowledge of science and machinery is punishable by death. However, where &quot;The Prince in Waiting&quot; is post-apocalyptic in its setting, &quot;Pavane&quot; describes a world shaped by a crucial incident that alters the course of history - namely, the assassination of Elizabeth I in 1588.<br />In &quot;Pavane&quot; we see a 20th century England ruled by the Catholic Church. Heresy is punished by draconian methods. While technological progress is largely held in check, minor innovations are grudgingly accepted. Electricity, television and computers are unheard of. One compensation (perhaps the only compensation) of this alternate world is that there is no industrial pollution.<br />&quot;Pavane&quot; reminds us of how much we take for granted. In the Western world that we know, people live in relative comfort, thanks to the benefits of modern medicine, education, mass production and democracy. Many people benefit from science. It improves our standard of living, allowing people to live lives of leisure, dignity and intellectual stimulation. The Church in &quot;Pavane&quot; is determined to avert this, for reasons that don't become clear until the very end of the novel.<br />The part of the book I enjoyed most was &quot;Brother John&quot;. I think this might be because I'm studying art myself. I've seen how tiring it is when lithography students grind away at a slab of stone. Because Keith Roberts is also an illustrator, the writing style is highly visual. Roberts has created a very convincing scenario in &quot;Pavane&quot;. This is the first alternate history novel I have read. I also plan to read Ward Moore's &quot;Bring the Jubilee&quot;, which is supposed to be in the same class as &quot;Pavane&quot;. Both these books are in the SF Masterworks series, which I'm currently collecting.	2001-11-07

After reading his excellent novella &quot;The Scarlet Plague&quot;, I then read some of his short stories about the Alaskan wilderness before coming across &quot;Martin Eden&quot;.<br />This is an autobiographical novel describing a young man, Martin Eden, and his long struggle to improve his standing in society. At the beginning of the story Martin is inarticulate, rough around the edges, and awkward in the presence of those he initially believes to be socially superior. When he meets Ruth Morse, a young lady of elegance and education, Martin's life changes. Impressed by Ruth's knowledge and apparent wisdom, Martin decides he wants to &quot;make good&quot;. It turns out Martin has a hard road to hoe.<br />This is an inspiring novel of a man who, while experiencing intellectual growth, endures poverty, hunger, rejection, and all manner of hardship in his efforts to succeed as a writer. Fame and fortune seem a long way off. Because we know the story is based on Jack London's life, we can be certain that Martin's persistence will eventually be rewarded. But what comes after success? And what's it all worth?<br />&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is a long journey of hope, bitterness and triumph. This is about a man who doesn't give in to adversity or yield to the conventions that society imposes on us. That makes Martin something rare. Most of us do get forced into that traditional pattern of drudgery and routine, of being slotted into a safe, sensible job with a comfortable salary, because that's what society expects of us. The pressure is hard to resist. It will be a long time before any of this changes. I think this book also says something about society's shallowness.<br />&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is a fine novel. I may be stating the obvious, but stories about people who started with nothing are much more interesting than stories about heirs to a fortune.	2001-11-01

In Thomas Disch's novel &quot;The Genocides&quot;, a race of unseen, uncaring aliens have done the work for us.<br />In the space of seven years Earth has been overwhelmed by towering alien Plants, whose dominance has all but destroyed the ecological balance upon which all species survival depends. Billions have died, cities have been razed to the ground, and the Incinerators efficiently mop up any survivors.<br />&quot;The Genocides&quot; concentrates on one isolated group that is still holding out. With grim determination, they skulk and scavenge among the Plants, trying to stave off the inevitable. Unlike the big-budget science fiction blockbuster films of recent years, this is not a story of heroism and valour. In fact, there are those who enjoy what is happening to them. Jeremiah Orville takes a perverse delight in the whole situation, while he plots revenge on the leader of the group who captured him.<br />This is certainly a grim story, and possibly one of the best interpretations of the alien invader theme. Comfortless, hard-hitting and bleak. Goodbye Earth.	2001-09-18

Set in a time so distant from ours, the sun is a dull red ball in a dark sky, futuristic cities are half-buried mounds of ancient rubble, and magic is as natural as walking.<br />These four books are generally regarded as fantasy, but it has elements of science fiction as well. The magic that characters perform is really just advanced science, but it's so sophisticated it looks like magic to us. (If a caveman could see how we live in the 21st century he would think everything we did was magic too.) The future in these books is so remote, there is a religous sect who won't walk on the ground because it would seem like desecration to the aeons of dead people in the soil.<br />The first book in the collection, &quot;The Dying Earth&quot;, involves a range of colourful characters. They each go on a mini-quest of some sort, facing many exotic dangers. The next two books, &quot;The Eyes of the Overworld&quot; and &quot;Cugel's Saga&quot;, follow the adventures of Cugel the Clever, an amoral, likeable rogue who lives on his wits. Most of the time it's his own greed that gets him into trouble. The last book is &quot;Rhialto the Marvellous&quot;.<br />This series is quite an achievement. I read &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot; a couple of years ago, knowing it was inspired by Jack Vance's work. I find that Vance's style of writing is easier to comprehend, it's less cryptic and less ornate. There is always something to keep the reader interested. <br />Anyone who likes fantasy or science fiction should read these.	2001-07-02

You look at these works with a sense of wonder, amazement and envy.<br />Like Chris Moore, his attention to detail is astonishing. Every part of the picture is treated with equal importance. (I love the way he paints every blade of grass, every little pebble and every single leaf in his backgrounds.)<br />I have to confess, a lot of the SF books I have read were bought simply because Jim Burns did the cover. It's interesting to note that Burns was among many artists influenced by the British 1950s comic &quot;Eagle&quot;, which featured the hugely popular story &quot;Dan Dare - Pilot of the Future&quot;. When &quot;Eagle&quot; resurfaced in the 1980s I grew up reading this comic too. <br />I'm currently in my second year at art college. I'm a little wary of admitting that I like SF art because a lot of lecturers tend to look down on it. Maybe they believe it's too commercial. But at home this is the sort of art I like to do. Futuristic architecture especially. <br />Looking at Jim Burns' detailed paintings, you wonder if he suffers much from eyestrain. In the beginning of the book he mentions &quot;airbrush thumb&quot;. Sitting at a keyboard might not be so comfortable either. Every artist has their cross to bear. With this book you could spend hours looking at just one painting.<br />Perhaps in the future, centuries from now, people will look at Jim Burns' work the way we look at the work of Hieronymous Bosch.	2001-06-26

I had already read &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; and &quot;Chocky&quot;. This novel was published ten years after Wyndham's death in 1969.<br />The story is about an island called Tanakuatua, where a millionaire plans to build a community. The narrator, who lost his wife and daughter in a car accident, volunteers for a position as one of the &quot;pioneers&quot;. Little do the settlers realize the island is inhabited by swarms of intelligent, deadly spiders. Radiation from nuclear tests gave the spiders' evolution a bit of a push.<br />I have a feeling Wyndham had quite a fascination with spiders. In one of his early short stories (&quot;More Spinned Against&quot;) a man who collects spiders meets a rather grisly fate. In another of Wyndham's stories, &quot;Wanderers of Time&quot;, the heroes are in a remote future where swarms of intelligent ants rule the world. It seems like a similar formula was used for &quot;Web&quot;: the idea of humble creatures becoming intelligent rulers.<br />The premise is a bit reminiscent of &quot;Them&quot; (a giant ants movie), or &quot;Swarm&quot;, a killer bees movie, but there is a certain degree of intelligence in the story.	2001-06-24

Best described as short and sharp, they make an obvious attempt to be humorous. True to the Wyndham style, the humour is often dry. In a way the tales are almost like &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes (the ones shown in the late 1950s). Not all of them fit comfortably into a particular genre. You have to bear in mind they were written in a different culture to the one that exists now.<br />The first story (&quot;Jizzle&quot;) is about a circus monkey who can accurately draw what she sees. &quot;A Present From Brunswick&quot; is like a warped version of the Pied Piper. Other stories involve heaven, hell, living one's life over again, meeting one's future self, and nurturing pet dragons.<br />One story that stands out for me is called &quot;The Wheel&quot;. It's about a post-apocalyptic, god-fearing community who believe that the wheel is evil. According to their history, the devil tempted man with the wheel until eventually the human race was almost wiped out because of it. Does that sound a little bit like &quot;The Chrysalids&quot;? There's even a young boy in the story called David, who unwittingly upsets everyone when he brings home a crate with wooden wheels on it.<br />All these stories were compiled in 1954, its interesting to see how the writer started out. According to the book &quot;Trillion Year Spree&quot; J.G. Ballard had some pretty harsh words to say about John Wyndham. It's hard to say what Ballard would have made of these stories. Then again, people have said some harsh words about Ballard.<br />&quot;Jizzle&quot; was later revised for American readers as &quot;Tales of Gooseflesh and Laughter&quot;.	2001-06-13

The United States, or, more accurately, the land east of the Mississippi River, has been attacked by atomic bombs and biological weapons. This devastated portion of the United States is now under quarantine. No one gets out, no one gets in.<br />Gary is now faced with a battle for survival. Trapped in a world returning to barbarism, he's determined to find a way of crossing the river and returning to the civilization that still exists on the other side. But the biological weapons have left Gary and the other survivors infected with plague germs. Anyone who tries to cross the river is killed by the soldiers guarding the bridges, for fear of spreading contamination. Gary is trapped between armed soldiers on one side and lawless violence on the other. Over the months, things go from bad to worse...<br />&quot;The Long Loud Silence&quot; was written in 1952, the same year the United States detonated the first hydrogen bomb. The novel is grim but not as bleak as some of the other books in the genre. In fact it's quite optimistic in some ways. The novel is set in the 1950s. Corporal Gary is a World War Two veteren. That experience gives him an advantage over the other survivors he is trapped with; he knows the tricks of survival. One expression Gary is fond of using is &quot;hell of a note&quot;. Was the author afraid of using profanity? It's an expression I've never heard before. It sure gets used a lot, though.<br />The cover artwork shows a muscle-bound, macho-looking guy in a ripped shirt holding a gun. Behind him is a stylized mushroom cloud. The only thing I have in common with this character is that he has the same birthday as me. He was celebrating his birthday and recovering from the resulting hangover when the attack happened. That's how he got into his predicament. It just goes to show that getting drunk is a stupid thing to do. You can spend the rest of your life paying for it.<br/>Although this is a good book, an even better one I can recommend is &quot;The Death of Grass&quot; by John Christopher. That too involves unseen atomic weapons and a struggle for survival.	2001-06-10

The book is apocalyptic in the truest sense of the word, as it closely bases itself on the prophecies foretold in the Book of Revelation. It turns out that the Bible is a factual book after all, those who accept Christ really will go to Heaven, and those who bear the mark of the Beast (a small computer scan known as a &quot;tag&quot;) will burn in Hell for all eternity.<br />The Earth has been plunged into chaos, ravaged by one catastrophe after another. Most of the planet is ruled by the Antichrist under his deceptively benign &quot;One World Community&quot;. As the world is falling into ruins and millions die at the hands of the Antichrist (known as Richard Grant Morrison), the only safe haven that exists is a camp in Israel. Ex-teacher Jimmy Lorden is given a chance to save someone from his past. He just has to go back to America and convince her to come back with him to Israel. After some persuasion he agrees to go. This is when we see the full extent of what has happened to the world and the evil that rules it.<br />Brian Caldwell has written his story in a very angry style, telling it from Jimmy's point of view. Caldwell made Jimmy a  realistic character in my opinion. He is not heroic, nor is he always sympathetic and likable. He is often selfish and abusive, bitter and twisted, and frequently does things out of self-interest while he says he wants to make things right. For someone having to cope with the end of the world, I wouldn't expect him to be too dignified and saintly.<br />I like the way Caldwell made the Antichrist look like an unassuming, English gentleman. Much more subtle than Damien Thorn or the dark man, but still articulate and seductive. In fact I think this book may be even better than &quot;The Stand&quot;. For one thing it moves faster, it's not as bloated with detail, and the destruction and suffering is more widespread. <br />I read most of the book yesterday and finished it this morning, so it was hard to put down. While nearly every page has an outburst of profanity, the book is worth a read.	2001-06-09

John Wyndham is a brilliant writer, and it's a pity he hasn't had a lot more recognition. I loved the premise of humans trying to preserve themselves in a post-nuclear world teeming with mutation. The main characters were very sympathetic and interesting. I am totally surprised by people who didn't like &quot;The Chrysalids&quot;. Were they reading the same book? The book is a literary feast filled with great imagery, especially the descriptions of the Fringes and the Badlands. The way those people think of the Old People is enough to give us a superiority complex (to a point). Like the detractors of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;,the people who belittle &quot;The Chrysalids&quot; are clearly in the minority. This book is amazing. Read it now!	2001-01-07

D-503, a mathematician, is building a ship called the Integral, which will spread logic, reason and \\"happiness\\" to the rest of the universe. As D-503 quotes from the One State Gazette: \\"If they fail to understand that we bring them mathematically infallible happiness, it will be our duty to compel them to be happy.\\"<br />D-503 suffers from a terrible sickness: he is afflicted with a soul. <br />The One State is a mathematically structured, artificial environment where life is sterile, spartan and mechanical. Buildings are all made of glass, citizens (numbers) have to march in time to the anthem of the State. At regulated mealtimes they also chew their artificial food in unison.<br />One of the strange things about D-503's life is that he believes his world is enviable. Just as we look back at our own history with an amazed shudder of disbelief, so too does D-503. His society has done away with horrible things like hunger, love and freedom in order to experience happiness. Even so, there are still a few \\"enemies of happiness\\" among the numbers who are publicly liquidated by the Benefactor's Machine.<br />Although this is the book that influenced \\"1984\\" I only heard of \\"We\\" about two years ago, when I saw its name mentioned in one of Anthony Burgess' novels. (\\"1985\\".) D-503 writes the book in a series of entries, in a style that reads almost like poetry. (Although D-503 says he has no gift for poetry.) I can imagine the narrator's voice sounding dull and lifeless. As someone who puts great value on privacy, I find the idea of living in a glass house completely repulsive. <br />The influences on \\"1984\\" are obvious: The Benefactor = Big Brother, the Guardians = the Thought Police, the One State = Oceania. But even though \\"1984\\" enjoys wider recognition than \\"We\\", there is no doubt that Yevgeny Zamyatin's novel is the definitive bleak future; the template for all dystopian novels.	2000-12-25

Having read all John Wyndham's better-known work, I thought I'd sample this curiosity.<br />These stories are from the era when John Wyndham was writing as John Beynon. The stories in this book were originally published in the pulp magazines, when  Wyndham was still developing his craft as a writer. The stories are a forerunner of such later classics as &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; and &quot;The Chrysalids&quot;.<br />The early stories in this collection showed promise. One of the stories (&quot;The Puff-Ball Menace&quot;) is about a species of deadly plant that threatens humanity. Sound familiar? &quot;Derelict of Space&quot; describes a future where space travel is commonplace. People have been on the Moon. (A concept people laughed at in the 1930s.) Mind you, in Wyndham's imagined future, Germany is still ruled by the Nazis. The story &quot;Wanderers in Time&quot; is about a collection of time travellers from different periods who find themselves on a future world where man no longer rules the planet. The Earth belongs to a very different, yet quite common, species.<br />I found &quot;Wanderers of Time&quot; in a second-hand bookshop. The cover was a painting of a space ship by the well-known fantasy artist Chris Foss. Between the covers its pages are yellowed by age. The original price sticker was still on the back. In the United Kingdom it cost just 40 pence. In Australia, $1.25. That should give you an idea of how long the book's been out of print. I paid $9.95 for it. How times have changed.  <br />I've yet to complete my collection of John Wyndam's books. His more obscure works should be published again.	2000-12-19

The severity and grimness varies widely when they imagine the consequences that follow. Either the war is so destructive all life is wiped out, or mankind is plunged into the depths of savagery, or the destruction is only light and life goes on. <br />As far as I know, Walter M. Miller is the only writer to imagine a nuclear holocaust happening twice. Covering a period of eighteen centuries, \\"A Canticle For Leibowitz\\" shows how we fail to learn from the past and how we make the same mistakes over and over again. <br />Miller imagines the nuclear holocaust (The Flame Deluge) destroying civilization and putting the survivors into an age of ignorance, brought about by The Simplification. This phase lasts 600 years. In that time monks in a monastery have devoted their lives to preserving scraps of the old scientific knowledge, which survived the murderous rampage of the mobs in the early years after the holocaust.<br />As more centuries pass, the inventions of the past are gradually rediscovered until, by the final third of the book, nuclear technology has reappeared, threatening to destroy civilization once again.<br />While \\"A Canticle For Leibowitz\\" is bleak, it also has a humorous side. This is one of the best-known books of the genre, and, just like events repeating themselves in Miller's story, the premise has been imitated many times by other writers.<br />Like the interpretations of how Atlantis sank, every writer has their own idea of how the nuclear holocaust will turn out, and how destructive its effects will be. If nuclear war is something we're doomed to repeat, perhaps every author of the topic is right with their description. Naturally, there's only one way to find out. But we don't really want to know which authors got it right, do we?	2000-12-13

The survivors and their descendents now live like their stone-age forebears: wearing animal skins, hunting with bows and arrows and believing in superstition.<br />In describing the plague's onslaught, the old man tells his grandchildren of the chaos and degradation that wiped out civilization. Money became worthless, the streets of burning cities were littered with corpses, animals grew wild as mankind lost his supremacy over nature.<br />The three boys have a lot of trouble understanding the words &quot;Granser&quot; uses, due to their lack of education. (Even the word &quot;education&quot; is something the boys have never heard of.) Nevertheless, the old man does the best he can, in spite of the children's limited vocabulary.<br />It's interesting to compare &quot;The Scarlet Plague&quot;, which was written in 1912, to the more widely-known &quot;Earth Abides&quot;. Both books are set in the same place. They both contain that sense of nostalgia, where old men, left over from the &quot;lost world&quot; yearn for a past that was more attractive.<br />This could well be the blueprint for life-after-the-apocalypse stories. If this story hadn't been written, their would probably never have been such books as &quot;Earth Abides&quot;, &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;, &quot;Empty World&quot; or &quot;The Stand.&quot;	2000-12-12

How would you react? For Karl Glogauer, this is just what happens. But it turns out things aren't what Karl expected. The simple carpenter's son is exactly that - simple. A grinning, salivating imbecile, who can only say his own name with a moronic giggle.<br />This is one of the funniest books about time travel I have read. It's about disillusionment, finding yourself, trying to work out who you are, and making amends. Karl Glogauer is a man full of social failings. A victim who is mixed up, confused and uncertain. The problem is he hates himself, and can't accept the good things other people see in him. <br />Before I had heard of this book I had my own theory that Jesus might have been a time traveller from the future, say the 28th century. He would have had all sorts of advanced technology to make it look like he was performing miracles, such as a pair of hover boots to make it look like he was walking on water. Or genetically modifying five loaves and two fishes to feed thousands. His claim to be the son of God would have been the ultimate hoax.<br />The time traveller in &quot;Behold the Man&quot; is from the 20th century and takes on the role of Jesus rather reluctantly. He utters prophecies that are uncannily accurate (he's read it all in a book), and he &quot;heals&quot; those whose afflictions are purely psychosomatic. All the quotations in the bible are based on Karl's actions. The things Karl does will be interpreted down the centuries, affecting the lives of millions.<br />This is a wonderfully iconoclastic work, full of mocking wit. I finished reading it the same day I bought it, it's not a very long book. It really makes you think about destiny and what we're all about.	2000-12-04

The survivors called the disaster Tribulation. No one knows why it happened, but the narrator, David, attributes it to &quot;a phase of irreligious arrogance&quot;, which God, in his anger, punished. Only a few legends of the Old People remain. Centuries (millenia?) have passed, and the descendents of the Old People continue to pick up the pieces.<br />&quot;The Chrysalids&quot; is a book that deals with the issue of normality. Basically, to be considered normal you have to be in the majority. In the world David describes anything &quot;not right&quot; is deemed an &quot;Offence&quot; or a &quot;Blasphemy&quot;. Mutants are seen as the spawn of the devil and must be destroyed to preserve the true image. (Throughout history people have always needed someone to persecute for the world's ills.)<br />The reader will probably have guessed that this is a world after a nuclear holocaust. But we don't actually know for sure. Other reviewers have criticised the scientific validity of radiation and its effects. For all we know it could have been a weapon even more powerful than an H-bomb that caused Tribulation. (Who knows what scientific marvels the 21st century will bring? No one imagined nuclear weapons at the start of the 20th.)<br />I like the way the book has a go at the self-righteousness of religion. How much cruelty and suffering has been inflicted on innocent people in the name of religion? The way mutants are treated in &quot;The Chrysalids&quot; is reminiscent of the witch hunts in 18th century Europe. As a matter of fact, the future described in this book resembles the 18th century. There is no technology and David describes the world as someone in the 18th century would see it, hence the formal language, unused by people today.<br />This would be one of John Wyndham's greatest novels. One of the best of the genre.	2000-11-30
US	50780673	R382U9K56HDFW5	0450060764	339791742	Domain	Books	4	2	2	N	N	London's Burning	London is a sprawling, busy metropolis until the unthinkable happens: a sudden, unexpected nuclear attack  that takes everyone by surprise. The city is panic-stricken as people try to run from the bombs. For most of them it is too late. Steve Culver is one of the fortunate ones. With the help of a V.I.P. he reaches the safety of a secret government shelter, hidden near the Underground. <br />The fact that London is now a flattened jumble of twisted wreckage with a poisonous atmosphere would be bad enough in itself. But James Herbert has brought back some familiar characters from two earlier books: a mutant breed of killer rats who now have the upper hand. <br />The premise itself is good. Being trapped underground, beneath a city of rat-gnawed corpses, wandering what hope there is.  Eventually the survivors are forced out of their shelter, and attempt to get out of London, while being chased by millions of sqeaking, bloodthirsty vermin. <br />&quot;Domain&quot; is a disturbing book to begin with. Herbert's description of things like radiation sickness and the way the rats attack helpless survivors are very graphic. But after a while the gore starts to get a little repetitive. There is a good sense of fear as the characters walk through the sewer tunnels. Very dark and claustrophobic.<br />If you like survival novels, &quot;Domain&quot; is certainly worth a read.	2000-10-22
US	50780673	R2G0O04Z88NQ4K	0671039725	769595666	Carrie	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Revenge	I read &quot;Carrie&quot; when I was in high school. Stephen King captured the essence of teenage life with great accuracy, I thought. At school people talked about the same things the shower girls in the first chapter talked about: parties, who's going out with who, who's dumping who, and a whole lot of other shallow topics that seemed really important at that age. For a first novel, King handled the dialogue well.<br />Everyone knows the story: a misfit girl finally gets her revenge on a town that rejected her. Being telekinetic is something I'm sure a lot of people would envy, even if they don't envy Carrie's plight. But ultimately the school and the town brought their destruction on themselves. No one can ever predict when someone will snap and wreak havoc. Bullied students who aren't telekinetic have to rely on less subtle means such as pipe bombs and guns. And usually, the taste of revenge is less than sweet. But the results they aim for are quite the same: heartbreak, grief, confusion and despair. Perhaps bullying should be a criminal offense?<br />I once read somewhere that when King was writing this novel he was so frustrated with it that he threw the manuscript in the bin. It was his wife who salvaged it and forced him to keep working on it. I also read that first novels are almost always autobiographical. Was King ridiculed in his youth? If so, then his international success as a writer is surely the best revenge.	2000-10-15

The way he uses paint to depict a 3-dimensional form on a 2-dimensional surface is amazing. The work is so life-like. (And in many cases, erotic.)<br />I liked reading about Vallejo's humble beginnings, where we see samples of his early, unpublished work. It was also a relief to know that even this master of the figure uses photographs. Contrary to many student's belief, it is not &quot;cheating&quot;. To make his point, Vallejo is convinced that if the Old Masters had had access to photography, they would certainly have preferred to use that rather than rely on a model who gets bored, tired, etc. Vallejo uses both the model and the photograph.<br />In addition to advice about colour, tone, light, and how to &quot;see&quot;, we are also taken through some step-by-step paintings, to show how the image is gradually built. Advice about portfolios comes at the end.<br />I have a board game called &quot;Hero Quest&quot;, a sword-and-sorcery type adventure. The painting on the box looks like it was done by Vallejo, but I couldn't find his signiature. The colours and brushwork looked like his. The main figure was a Conan-type character swinging his sword. If you read Vallejo's &quot;Fantasy Art Techniques&quot; there is a good chance you will also paint like this eventually.	2000-10-03

When Rob's father is electrocuted, he is sent to a boarding school where life becomes a nightmare of over-zealous discipline and torment.<br />Rob hears about the Barrier, which divides the Conurb from the rural, open spaces known as the County. Rob runs away from the boarding school and crosses the Barrier, hoping for a better life. On the surface, life in the County seems perfect. But Rob soon learned that appearances are very deceptive...<br />Although &quot;The Guardians&quot; is not as fast-moving as the &quot;Tripods Trilogy&quot;, it's an interesting book nevertheless. Some of the things John Christopher writes about in his imaginary future are rather close to the bone. In the culture I live in, sport is treated with much more reverence than literature and the arts. There are signs that people devote less time to reading, as it's much easier to slump in front of the screen, watching sentimental drivel. More than ever, our lives are controlled by the media and a growing lack of privacy. <br />The two worlds John Christopher writes about here are deceptively utopian, but are in fact places where people are ruled by a cynical elite. Books like &quot;The Guardians&quot; remind us that the freedom we have is something we must never take for granted.	2000-09-30

Jersild in 1982, the book is divided into two &quot;scenarios&quot;. In the first scenario the story is an account told by a young man living in a post-nuclear world.<br />The narrator, whose name is Edvin, takes us on a depressing journey around an island in Scandinavia. Edvin is a man who lives in almost total ignorance of the world that was destroyed by war. We are never actually certain when this war took place but one of the characters has an &quot;old&quot; calender from 1994.  If I remember correctly, Edvin was born in a fallout shelter, surrounded by demoralized, bitter and tragic survivors.<br />Edvin is something of a drifter. We learn a bit about his past, where his lack of education becomes obvious. He only knows  little snippets of the past. At one point he wonders what made the cars go forward. He is amazed when a man with medical training tells him about something called x-rays. <br />Virtually all the characters in this story are ugly. Even the narrator's looks are marred by a hare-lip, which gives him a very derogatory nick-name. It's obvious that the people live lives of strain and hardship. Edvin is 33 but looks much older. Radiation has shrunk the world's population considerably. No one is trying to rebuild or repopulate. Their memories of the better world are too painful. They're  resigned to the fact that humanity will be the next extinct species.<br />In scenario two, the book takes us 10 years beyond Edvin's story, but it all ends in hopeless futility. &quot;After the Flood&quot; will leave you feeling cold.	2000-09-23

I remember seeing it in the book shop when it first came out. The cover had Paul Sheldon in his  wheelchair, writhing in agony - Annie Wilkes looked like a witch. The cover  did its job in getting me to pick up the book and read what it was  about.<br />Paul Sheldon, a bestselling romance novelist, has killed the woman  that made him a household name - Misery Chastain. Many writers see  themselves as gods - they decide what happens to their creations. Was it  karma then, when Paul Sheldon was nearly killed in a car accident- to be  discovered by the ultimate crazed fan? Forced to bring a woman back to life  for her &quot;great return&quot;?<br />The situation King writes about here is  frightening because it is possible. There is nothing supernatural in this  story. Psychotic admirers are very real, and King makes Annie Wilkes sound  like the fan from hell. At one point Paul actually thinks Annie is the  devil. Later he sees her as a goddess - someone who can bring pain (with a  variety of tortures), or take it away (with powerful drugs).<br />In  &quot;Misery&quot;, there is a feeling of confinement, much like  &quot;Cujo&quot;. One of the things I found interesting about this book was  when Annie was talking about one of her past victims - an artist doing  sketches of the ruined Overlook Hotel, which was burned down by a crazed  caretaker some years back. I thought it was a pretty clever way of  including an advertisement for &quot;The Shining&quot;. I found the  sections of manuscript for &quot;Misery's Return&quot; a bit dry. I'm not a  fan of romance novels.<br />Although this is a good book, I still prefer  &quot;The Stand&quot;. I lent my first copy of &quot;Misery&quot; to  someone -  and never got it back. My new copy had a different cover: Paul  Sheldon in his wheelcahair, with a shadow of Annie holding an axe. I've  lent it to so many people, the pages are starting to fall out.	2000-09-20

In the city of Ambroy, Ghyl Tarvoke grows up in a feudal-like society where mass production is  forbidden and craftsmen are exploited. Early in the book Ghyl is seven when  he sees a puppet show. This proves to be a pivotal event in his formative  years. <br />Over the years Ghyl starts to question the morality of the ruling  elite, who literally tower over the masses. His actions are influenced by  the mythological hero Emphyrio...<br />The culture of Ghyl's world is  unwittingly oppressed by corruption. But is someone oppressing the  oppressors? As Ghyl reaches maturity he sets out to fight this and make the  truth known.<br />This is the first novel I've read by Jack Vance, and I have  to say it's intriguing. Vance makes his characters sound very believable.  (I've never come across a character more obnoxious than Nion Bohart.) In  the back of my mind I suspected that this book might have been one of the  works that influenced the look of &quot;Star Wars&quot; - especially with  that combination of space-ships and old-fashioned dress. A paragraph in  chapter 5 actually refers to a conflict called the Star Wars. Also to an  emperor. If it wasn't &quot;Emphyrio&quot; that was the influence I'm  pretty sure it was &quot;The Dying Earth&quot;. That and  &quot;Dune&quot;.<br />In any case, &quot;Emphyrio&quot; is well worth a read.  It makes you think that anyone can fight injustice if they're determined  enough.	2000-08-29

Incidentally, this  is the book where I first heard of Mervyn Peake's &quot;Gormenghast  Trilogy&quot;. I did a painting of Gormenghast Castle, as it suggested in  the book, and sold it for $100!<br />Sadly, work for fantasy artists is quite  rare in Australia, especially in Brisbane. A lot of ordinary people won't  take fantasy and science fiction seriously as an art form. I don't know if  it's because of conservatism, or just plain lack of interest. Either way  it's annoying. Many people associate it with &quot;Star Trek&quot; and  brand it &quot;kitsch&quot; or &quot;unoriginal&quot;.<br />Much of the  fantasy art I do is of futuristic cities and post-apocalyptic scenes.  Radioactive fallout gives me a good excuse for having bad figure work! The  &quot;Encyclopedia of Fantasy and Science Fiction Art Techniques&quot;   also dispels a lot of myths. For example: there's nothing wrong with using  photographs! (As long as you own the copyright to it.) The book also proves  that the computer is a valid art tool.<br />If you have a good imagination,  this book is certainly worth having.	2000-08-26

A book of stories covering a variety of weird  situations, this is a book that is sadly hard to find.<br />The best story is  the first one, &quot;Consider Her Ways&quot;. Set in a future where men are  extinct, female society is regimented and &quot;perfect&quot;. The story  has something of a &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; feel to it, especially at the  end. It also pre-dates the Women's Lib movement by a decade. Feminists  would love this story.<br />Another memorable story is &quot;Random  Quest&quot;, in which a scientist is accidentally transported to an  alternate reality where his other self is a successful writer. (This story  was filmed as &quot;Quest For Love&quot; in the 1970s. Denholm Elliot was  one of the stars.)<br />&quot;A Long Spoon&quot; involves the devil. This is a  humorous story that comes at the end.<br />&quot;Consider Her Ways and  Others&quot; is a perfect companion to John Wyndham's other collection of  stories &quot;The Seeds of Time&quot;. This is genuine science fiction.  Overall, there are six stories in the book. And there's not a single space  ship in any of them!	2000-08-21

The narrator, who is writing a book about the atomic bombing of  Hiroshima, meets in the course of his research a variety of weird and  wonderful characters who recount their experiences of the late Dr.  Hoenikker. This leads him on a quest to find Hoeniker's three children, who  each possess &quot;chips&quot; of Ice-nine...<br />A novel that has been  compared a number of times to &quot;Dr Strangelove&quot;, &quot;Cat's  Cradle&quot; is a witty, dry-humored approach to the apocalypse. Although  Hoenikker's three children are weird, I could relate to these characters  more than any of the others in the book.<br />The way in which the world comes  to an end is so ironic and offbeat. I can imagine Terry Gilliam making a  movie of this novel. With his quirky approach to film-making, I'm sure it  would work well.	2000-08-03

I first heard of the author 12 years ago after seeing &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;. At that time I had no idea that Ballard's early works were science  fiction.<br />&quot;The Drowned World&quot; (Ballard's first novel) is set in  a future where most of the planet is underwater or covered in lush jungle.  Melting ice caps have caused the sea level to rise, and an altered climate  has forced the population to flee to the areas of the Arctic and Antarctic  Circles. Intense sunlight is causing the temperature to rise all the time,  making the environment increasingly hostile to human life. The only  creatures that thrive in the new conditions are fish, insects and reptiles,  which are all growing bigger and bolder.<br />The mood of this book is  brooding and melancholic. The small group of characters, who live in a  tropical, submerged London, have dreams linked to a world millions of years  in the past, as the Earth's ecology reverts to a prehistoric wilderness.  There is an interesting discussion about the built-in &quot;race  memory&quot; in the human psyche. People's fear of snakes and lizards can  be linked to the time when early mammals lived in fear of the reptiles, who  were the dominant lifeform millions of years ago. (And are becoming so  again.)<br />I think some of the inspiration for &quot;The Drowned World&quot;  may have come from John Wyndham's &quot;The Kraken Wakes&quot;, which also  featured a submerged London (although the climate was getting colder, not  hotter). In turn &quot;The Drowned World&quot; may have been the  inspiration for that much-maligned film &quot;Waterworld&quot;. Ballard's  writing style is descriptive like H.G. Wells and M.P. Shiel: poetic and  elegant, if a little flowery.<br />Throughout the book there is an  undercurrent of pessimism. This is not about adventure and discovery, but a  world in decline (for humanity at least). In a planet prone to change,  Earth has changed radically. Ballard plays with the theme of transformation  in other books:&quot;The Wind From Nowhere&quot;, &quot;The Burning  World&quot; and &quot;The Crystal World&quot;. In Ballard's series of  disaster novels &quot;The Drowned World&quot; is, to use a cliche, the  beginning of the End.	2000-07-15

If you think the human race deserves to be wiped out, you'll be in for a treat.<br />&quot;Armageddons&quot; is a collection of twelve short  stories about the end of the world, imagined by some of science fiction's  best known writers. The twelve stories are  imaginitive scenarios that  describe how the human race could become extinct, whether it be through  nuclear war, plague, pollution, or natural disaster.<br />It's amazing how  pessimistic some people can be. You wonder if some of these writers are  really telling stories or setting down prophecies. <br />Anthony Burgess once  had  something to say about apocalyptic stories. He believed that so-called  &quot;warnings&quot; about the end of the world were really just  wish-fulfillment. There is a part of us that deperately wants the  apocalypse to come. That's why it captures are imaginations so much.  Burgess was mainly referring to stories about the third world war. Still,  there could be something in what he said.<br />If you ponder things like the  end of the world then &quot;Amageddons&quot; will definitely whet your  appetite.	2000-06-20

In this strange world we gradually perceive what it was that  reduced mankind to barbarism: a nuclear war thousands of years ago. <br />The  people in Riddley's tribe have a new religion based on the holocaust of the  remote past, and legends about the lost world they look back upon: (boats  in the air and picters in the wind, the 1 Big 1 put in barms time back way  back.) <br />The first obvious clue that the book is set in England (now  Inland) is the map at the front. The frequent rain is another clue. The   parts where the book is most inventive are when Riddley walks through the  ruined towns: &quot;Crumbelt birks and broak stoans all a jumbl and a  parcht smel unner neath of old berning.&quot;<br />Riddley becomes caught up  in a plan to try and get things moving &quot;frontways&quot;. That is, to  get back all the things that were lost. The secret of achieving this seems  to lie in a group of special ingredients: one of these being a bag of  yellow stones that two factions are fighting for.<br />I like to think of  &quot;Riddley Walker&quot; as a sort of sequel to Robert Swindells' novel  &quot;Brother in the Land.&quot; There are certain things that link the two  books. &quot;Brother in the Land&quot; was published four years after  &quot;Riddley Walker&quot;. It was set in England immediately after the  nuclear war and was narrated by a boy not much older than Riddley. Even at  that time new words were starting to creep into the language. The boy wrote  his account in the hope that any descendents reading it would learn from  what happened and not start the whole conflict up again. Thousands of years  later in Riddley's time, it seems things have not changed. Most of the  paople are unable to read anyway. Even if they could, they would have  little inkling of what the long-dead narrator was saying.<br/>&quot;Riddley  Walker&quot; is a very rewarding book. It's both puzzling and entertaining.  Read it more than once and you'll always find new things.	2000-05-20
US	50780673	R39M9TIWLJXD0	999749802X	1396600	Last and First Men	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Looking Forward	Last and First Men is probably the ultimate book of human evolution. First published in 1930, Olaf Stapledon writes a &quot;history&quot; of mankind's future over a period of two billion years.<br />The book starts with an  introduction by one of the Last Men. He has projected his mind two billion  years into the past and taken control of the mind of one of the First Men,  represented as Olaf Stapledon.<br />Through the writer we get an account of  mankind's progress, with his triumphs and achievements, his highs and lows.  We alternately go through phases of enlightenment and barbarism, as the  book describes eighteen different species of Man. The First Men (homo  sapiens) are the most primitive.<br />This book is written rather like a  textbook. There are no actual characters, as you would find in a novel.  Because the story goes over two billion years, it's a book you can read at  a slow, relaxed pace. It took me over a month to read. This is not a book  you can rush through. Sometimes you have to read carefully, to understand  what the &quot;possessed&quot; writer is describing.<br />Last and First Men  makes you feel very small and insignicant. The first few chapters are badly  dated, which Gregory Benford advises the reader to skip, but after the  collapse of the First Men, the book begins to take off. It's like an  incredibly long journey: full of twists and turns, unexpected diversions  and unfamiliar scenery.<br />This book has been an inspiration to such  authors as Arthur C. Clarke and Kim Stanley Robinson.	2000-04-07

People live in a post-apocalypse world and live in awe of the &quot;Roadmakers&quot; - an ancient civilization who were mysteriously wiped out by a plague.  Everywhere the remains of Roadmaker society can be found. Crumbling roads  and ruined buildings covered in vines. <br />This sounded like a good story,  when I found it in the bookshop. I am a fan of post-apocalypse science  fiction. Unfortunately, I got the feeling that I had read this story  before. A group of people embarking on a quest, finding ruins, meeting  different characters, finding ruins, stopping at different places, finding  ruins, getting into danger, finding ruins, performing acts of bravery,  finding ruins, love interest between the heroes, and then finding more  ruins until they eventually reach their goal.<br />Maybe the post-apocalypse  theme is a bit worn out. Or maybe it's because I've read so many  apocalyptic stories that the book didn't seem all that original any more. A  much better book in my opinion is &quot;The Chrysalids&quot; by John  Wyndham. Another good book is &quot;The White Mountains&quot; by John  Christopher. Not forgetting &quot;The Postman&quot; by David Brin. I'm not  criticizing the way &quot;Eternity Road&quot; is written, but to me the  story did take a while to get going, and I was relieved when I finally  finished.<br />Some time afterward I donated the book to the local library.	2000-01-29

The narrator is Edvin. He is 33 years old and born with a harelip. At the start of the novel Edvin is on a ship with pirates. He is sent on a reconnaissance to on an island, where he is then abandoned.<br />On the island  Edvin meets two men, Petsamo and Henry. Petsamo is something of a doctor,  (or the closest you can get to a doctor in a world without medical  supplies)  who  treats people the best way he can. Henry is a deeply  religious, ailing old man. Edvin becomes a slave (or nurse) to Henry. When  Henry dies Edvin moves on, often crossing paths with Petsamo, and meeting  an assortment of other (mostly unpleasant) people.<br />Edvin often describes  the landscape. Mostly rock and water. He was born after the war, but he is  the youngest character in the story. Most of the other characters are what  Edvin calls the &quot;old-timers&quot;, people who are old enough to  remember the world as it was. Edvin is often used as a toy by other men but  he doesen't mind this. He uses sex as a way to feel  needed. He also uses  it to survive. <br />The world Edvin describes is in slow decline. It is a  harsh, brutal world, where no children are being born. Radiation has caused  either sterility or genetic mutation. There is no beauty in any of the  people. In fact Edvin initially couldn't tell the difference between a man  and a woman. On the island are two groups of people. A brutal and ragged  band of killers and rapists, originally the inmates of a boy's prison,  which is now their fortress. And a group of nuns, who live in what is  called the rabbit convent.<br />This is a very pessimistic story. The flood is  something the older people refuse to talk about. The nature of the war is  also vague, but it was serious enough to damage the ozone layer. <br />After  the Flood is translated from PC Jersild's original text. The book is now  out of print, only two libraries in Australia have a copy. InJersild's  novel books are becoming increasingly scarce as they are mostly used for  fuel. PC Jersild has painted a portrait of a very grim future.	2000-01-21

He went to live in a quiet village with his grandparents. On the news one night was a story about a plague sweeping through  India.<br />Very soon the plague  rapidly spread around the world, killing  almost everyone. Neil was one of the few who survived. He goes in search of  other people.<br />I read this book ten years before I read Earth Abides. The  plague in this book is described in more detail. It resembles an ageing  disease, but starts off as a fever. An important difference in this book to  Earth Abides is that there aren't any adult survivors. The few people who  survived were young, possibly because the book was written for a juvenile  reader.<br />It's not known if civilization will ever recover. Even if people  survived the plague, many skills would have been lost. The story is good  but I wasn't happy with the ending.	2000-01-12

People live in a constant, artificial environment called the Bubble, where nothing can afford to be wasted. Marty was born on the moon, and he had never been to Earth. He makes friends with  a misfit called Steve. They steal a crawler and go joyriding outside the  Bubble.<br />When the crawler crashes through the moon's surface they find a  very strange world indeed...<br />This is an interesting book about life in  the future, but it wasn't as action packed as the Tripods Trilogy. Maybe  because there aren't as many characters, or there isn't as much variety  with location. <br />The book was  published the same year Neil Armstrong  became the first person to set foot on the moon. The Lotus Caves is set  nearly 100 years after that event. <br />It's an interesting idea that verdant  beauty could exist beneath something so arid and featureless. But recently  scientists discovered water beneath the moon's surface, so maybe John  Christopher wasn't so wide of the mark with this story.	2000-01-06
US	50780673	R3B70THZBYXJBV	071811101X	62140829	Stowaway to Mars	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Life on Mars - From Earth	&quot;Stowaway To Mars&quot; is one of John Wyndham's early science fiction efforts, written years before he got his big break with &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;. This futuristic story is set in the far-off year  1981, when a ship called the Gloria Mundi carries the first people to Mars.  A young woman has sneaked aboard the ship, and tells the crew of what to  expect when they touch down on Mars.<br />This novel can be compared to H.G.  Wells' &quot;First Men in the Moon&quot;. Both stories have been proved  inaccurate by that bubble burster called Reality. But this doesn't matter.  The imagination of such stories is what really counts. This book is the  beginning of one man's distinguished career.	2000-01-01
US	50780673	R2GAHB7YI69CVS	0449213013	750649906	Earth Abides	Books	5	9	12	N	N	New Beginning	&quot;Earth Abides&quot; deals with the collapse of society after a plague has killed nearly everyone in the world. Isherwood (Ish) Williams was in the mountains when this happened, so he was spared the trauma of seeing  everyone die around him. <br />&quot;Earth Abides&quot; is probably one of the  more realistic apocalypse books. A plague is tidier and more envionmentally  friendly than a nuclear holocaust so the world was quite lucky. The  survivors who band together are just ordinary people. No military  strategists, scientific experts or specialists. No engineers or architects.  They have to cope with life in a world without medical services, police,  government, or farmers. <br />Over the years, 20th century life is slipping  away and Ish's tribe can't bring any of it back. Decades later San  Francisco is a jungle and Ish is the last of the old race. The new race are  illiterate hunters but they are also a more decent people. They treat the  animals as equals, they are happier and have none of the hangups that  affected 20th century society before the plague. They'll never know how to  split the atom, build missiles, or damage the ozone layer.<br />Because  history tends to go round in circles I don't think civilization really died  after the plague. It just went to sleep. One day it will come back, maybe  in a few centuries. Something new and better. A rejuvinated world, fresh  and clean. <br />&quot;Earth Abides&quot; was a good book. It probably  wouldn't work as a movie, though. Not after the criticism that &quot;The  Postman&quot; got. But I thought  Kevin Bacon would be good as Ish. I'm not  sure who would play the other characters.	1999-12-30

This is a story about cloning that tries to sound scientifically plausible, unlike the clumsy science fiction movies of the 1950s where a magic machine  instantly makes a duplicate of a person.<br />In the 1970s Josef Mengele is hiding in South America. He has  planned the assassination of 94 elderly men  around the world who have to  die on  certain dates. Yakov Liebermann (based on Simon Wiesenthal) learns  of the plan and soon discovers the significance of the murders. Each of the  94 men are the unwitting fathers of a clone: a pale, arrogant boy with dark  hair and blue eyes. Liebermann discovers who the clone is, and realizes the  terrible consequences waiting to unfold for an unsuspecting world...<br />When  this book was first published, it probably seemed far-fetched. Cloning has  been in the news quite a lot in recent times. Bill Clinton declared human  cloning as an immoral practice, but I'm not sure I agree. Think of the  medical benefits. If you needed a blood transfusion, what better donor  could you find than your own clone? <br />In &quot;The Boys From Brazil&quot; bringing  someone back from the dead is not a simple matter of impregnating a woman  with cells from a donor. The clone would have to have the same upbringing  as the original, and experience the same things. Even then, there's a high  probability that the clone will turn out different. That's why Mengele  created 94 clones - to increase the chance of a successful outcome. An  outcome with horrifying implications. The novel itself seems to drag in  certain points, but it doesn't get monotonous. The ending is both amusing  and thought-provoking.	1999-12-18

Everyone in the village was sleeping. Anyone who ventured into the outskirts of the village would mysteriously black out. The next day things were back to normal. But every  woman of suitable age was pregnant...<br />&quot;The Midwich Cuckoos&quot; is  a metaphorical title for a book about collective intelligence. The alien  children born in the village are identical. Golden eyed, unemotional,  endowed with mental powers and superior intelligence. Over the years the  Children become a bigger problem. They commit a murder and contol the minds  of others. They are cold, ruthless and calculating.<br />This book has been  described as disturbing. When it was first published the idea of children  committing murderer was probably quite shocking. These days it seems  normal. This is an interesting book but I prefer the apocalyptic scenarios  in &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; and &quot;The Chrysalids&quot;.	1999-12-18
US	50780673	R29WUTRVSHXXPF	0899668968	664882873	Logan's Run	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Running for your life	In the future people live their lives to the full. People can travel to where they want when they want, they can enjoy a range of experiences that would make 20th century people envious.<br />The only drawback is that you  have to give up your life at the age of 21. People who don't wish to do  this are called runners. They are hunted down by executors and killed  brutally.<br />Logan is a good citizen. He is one of the people who hunts down  the cowardly runners. But now Logan's own time is up. The crystal flower  embedded in the palm of his right hand has turned black, and now he has to  complete his duty: suicide. Or, to use the euphemism, &quot;Deep  Sleep&quot;. Logan learns of a place called Sanctuary, where people can  live out their natural lives. He teams up with a girl called Jessica, and  they embark on a dangerous journey.<br />This is a fast-paced novel. There is  danger at every turn. Logan and Jessica are literally running for their  lives, pursued relentlessly by a hunter who will never sway from his task.  This novel is a product of its time. The late 1960s was a time of social  upheaval, when the young were finding a voice, rebelling against the older  generation. The crystal flower that everyone has on them is probably a nod  at the psychedelic &quot;flower power&quot; that was prevailing when the  book was first published. &quot;Logan's Run&quot; seems to be  warning us  of the dangers of misplaced idealism, which ultimately leads to fanaticism.  In a world filled to capacity the solution to overpopulation is drastic and  cruel. The writers are saying we should not surrender ourselves to the  lunacy of a conformist regime. It takes courage to go against the flow,  something so many people are unwilling to do in a world where minorities  are condemned.	1999-12-16
US	50780673	R3NUCVBFJJHF0M	0879514256	757042144	Titus Groan (Gormenghast Trilogy)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Underrated Masterpiece	I've read \\"Titus Groan\\" twice, just as I've read \\"Gormenghast\\" twice. I read them as a reaction to Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\". I actually enjoyed Mervyn Peake's story more. The characters are good because they are not cliches, nor are they heroic. I could relate to Steerpike more than Frodo Baggins. (I mean that in a good way.) <br />In \\"Titus Groan\\" the title character is a new-born baby, 77th heir to Castle Gormenghast. In Gormenghast everything revolves around pointless tradition. In our own world we're obsessed with tradition, what with anniversaries, Easter, Christmas, New Year's Eve, etc. We don't reach the same excesses they do in Gormenghast, however. I think one of Peake's messages was that \\"tradition\\" is another word for \\"excuse\\" - an excuse to keep things the same (as tradition is the natural enemy of change), or an excuse to do things that look really stupid (slavery, trial by ordeal). The people of Gormenghast have rather empty lives, and find ways to fill their time with ancient, obscure ritual. They're obliged to follow old values, even though they don't understand them.<br />Yes, there are a lot of unfamiliar words, but this broadens your vocabulary. The strange names of the characters make them oddly endearing. My favourite characters were Steerpike and Dr Prunesquallor. I like the way Steerpike charms the bitter twins Cora and Clarice, and cynically exploits them for his own plans. It's true that \\"Titus Groan\\" is leisurely-paced. But the castle is so fascinating and Peake's writing so descriptive, I felt like I was actually walking through those crumbling corridors. My favourite part is when Steerpike escapes Mr Flay and climbs to freedom, making his way across the \\"roofscape\\".<br />Mervyn Peake is also one of Robert Smith's favourite writers. (Robert Smith from \\"The Cure\\", that is.) I think one of Smith's songs might have been about Fuschia actually. On his \\"Faith\\" album.<br />If you haven't read \\"Titus Groan\\" and the other books, try them outand see what you think.	1999-12-16

A war has brought about the collapse of civilization. America, once a great nation, no longer exists. All that is left are ruined cities, scattered tribes and lawlessness. It has been like this for sixteen years. <br />The hero is 34  year-old Gordon Krantz. He is travelling across the country, looking for  something. Some sign of revival, someone who is &quot;taking  responsibility&quot;. After being robbed by bandits, Gordon is left with  almost nothing. It looks as if he will either starve or freeze to death.  Then, by an amazing stoke of luck, he finds the body of a postman. He puts  on the uniform, and from that point, even though he doesn't know it, he has  a new purpose.<br />He visits different tribes claiming to be a representative  of the new government, the Restored United States. Gordon is really acting  out an elaborate scam so he can get food and help. But Gordon is also  giving people hope. Gordon becomes totally involved in his role, so that he  almost believes in the lie himself. He even delivers mail to people as he  travels.<br />&quot;The Postman&quot; has a &quot;Mad Max&quot; feel to it.  There isn't as much action however, it's more of an intellectual story.  This is the only novel I've read by David Brin. Even though we're told it's  wrong to lie, Gordon's deception is the catylist for America's revival. The  return of technology, a new beginning. <br />Everyone needs something to  believe in. It's what keeps us going when times are hard. This is the  message I believe Brin is trying to get across.	1999-12-15

After taking a trip into the future, a Time Traveller returns to the 19th century and tells his colleagues what he saw.<br />In the distant  future there is nothing, not a trace, of our world left. The Time Travller  discovers a new society and finds that we have evolved into a puny,  ineffectual race called Eloi. At night he discovers the other half of the  society, the hideous, carniverous Morlocks. The Eloi live simple lives and  play in the sun. They are food for the Morlocks, who live underground,  operating machinery. The Time Traveller goes even further into the future,  to a depressing world where the sun is dying and monstrous creatures roam  the surface.<br />Getting away from the point for a moment, there was once  a  &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story called &quot;Timelash&quot;. In that story the  Doctor travels back in time and meets a young writer called Herbert, who  accompanies the Doctor on a journey to the future on another planet. There  are monsters called Morlox. At the end of the story the young writer gives  the Doctor one of his cards, which has the name HG Wells. The story implied  that HG Wells' novel was inspired by the Doctor! But in reality &quot;The  Time Machine&quot; paved the way for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, one of my  favourite childhood shows. So we owe a lot to Wells.<br />Time travel looks  like a fun thing to do but sometimes it's best if the future is left  unknown. Would you want to know your own future and find it's not what you  hoped for?	1999-12-15

The book is divided into three parts. <br />Phase One of the invasion begins with the sighting of fireballs that land in oceans  around the world. They are a strange phenomena but the public soon lose  interest. Then ships start to sink mysteriously...<br />In Phase Two more and  more ships are sinking and people are now aware of some malignant force at  work beneath the sea. In this stage of the campaign the invaders are  bolder, coming onto the shores of remote islands in &quot;sea tanks&quot;  and dragging people to their deaths.<br />In Phase Three the sea level has  risen, and cities are slowly being submerged. Morale is low, society is  breaking up, and people are living in small scavenging communities as land,  food and fuel become scarce.<br />This is a good disaster novel and well  written, but it's not as good as &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;. In  &quot;Triffids&quot; the destruction was sudden and more immediate. In  &quot;Kraken&quot; the destruction is more gradual and drawn out, like a  sick man fighting an illness. Like a disease, the invaders are never  actually seen, but the damage they do is great. Once more it looks like the  human race is finished, but the book ends with optimism.

Their adopted  young son Matthew has developed a habit of talking to himself. Matthew asks  strange questions, the kind that children wouldn't normally ask. He becomes  good at things in which he previously had no great ability. <br />And then  Matthew mentions Chocky.

Matthew is frustrated because Chocky  really exists. Chocky is an invisible entity from another planet. She uses  Matthew as an interpreter while she studies our planet. <br />This book was  made into a children's programme, and inspired two more spin-offs.  &quot;Chocky&quot; is a book about growing up, friendship, and the pain of  saying goodbye. The end of the book is particularly touching. This is a  book people should read at school.	1999-12-14

The movie was set in Cold War America, with martians that flew in what looked like greenish manta rays.  The book was set in Victorian England, and the martians looked like  towering tripods. In both versions however the premise is the same: Earth  invaded by a superior alien intelligence. HG Wells wrote about humanity's  ego and complacency being crushed by a highly developed  lifeform.<br />&quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; has been interpreted as an  allegory of imperialism. Just as the British took over other countries to  make them part of the Empire, so too is the Earth being taken over by the  Martians. They even bring their own plant life with them, the &quot;Red  Weed&quot;. The Martians see us as vermin, trying to wipe us out with heat  rays and poisonous black gas. Thats's what makes the story so much fun. It  is frightening in a cosy sort of way. We read the story in a safe,  comfortable room, while the narrator talks of all the death and destruction  he sees.<br />An interesting point that Issac Asimov once brought up was that  if alien intelligence did exist, their advanced evolution would also mean  they would be emotionally superior to us. They would not act like  barbarians, as war is a primitive thing. When people write alien invasion  stories, they are really saying something about us. We are destructive and  aggressive by nature. Our history has been one long story of conquest,  slavery and even genocide. So HG Wells has put a little bit of us into his  Martians. Both metaphorically (as imperialists), and literally (as food).	1999-12-10

People all over the country are going mad, commiting acts of depravity, perversion and murder. <br />James Herbert says \\"The Fog\\" was partly a throwback to the disaster novels of the 1950's and earlier. The story feels like 1950's horror in parts, albeit more graphic and gory. The two-word title makes me think of \\"The Blob\\". (The titles almost rhyme!) In this novel we are being threatened by something we can't even touch. Something that is growing out of control. There is plenty to keep the reader interested, it definitely isn't boring.

I read &quot;Dune&quot; (and all its sequels) when I was 21, turning 22. This was after I'd seen the books in the  shop for so many years. As a youngster I  was attracted by the airbrushed covers, with the giant worms, the robed  religious followers, the sand. The books looked frighteningly thick  though.<br />I finally gave &quot;Dune&quot; a go in 1998. Arthur C. Clarke  was right to compare this novel to &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. The  planet Arrakis is described in as much detail as Middle-Earth, the story is  monumental. When Paul Atreides' father is assassinated by the rival House  Harkonnen, Paul flees into the desert with his mother. They join the native  Fremen and eventually Paul leads them to greatness. There's a lot more to  the story than that of course, but it's too much to describe in a  paragraph.<br />If you plan to read the entire series its probably best if you  space the novels out a bit, read a couple of different books in between. It  will give a better sense of time passing. I read the books one after the  other. By the time I finished I thought I would see a Reverend Mother in  the street. I found the last two books a bit slow, but I felt obliged to  finish them. The original &quot;Dune&quot; is by far the best of the  series. <br />I've also seen the film (I think David Lunch did the best he  could under the circumstances).  We have the computer game too. It's  amazing all the merchandise that has been created by this one book.	1999-12-09

Set in the near future (the early 1960's), people in Australia are waiting with dignity for radioactive fallout to kill them. A nuclear war in  the northern hemisphere has already destroyed everything there. In a few  months the same will happen here.<br />I read &quot;On the Beach&quot; in  1989. That same year I had seen &quot;The Day After&quot; and  &quot;Testament&quot;. For some reason I had a morbid fascination with the  end of the world, and what might happen after.<br />&quot;On the Beach&quot;  might seem a bit dated now. The consequences of nuclear war have been  speculated upon for several years. In 1983 scientists came up with the  nuclear winter theory, where all the dust and fallout from the explosions  would block out the sun and cause the world to freeze over. It sounds  plausible enough. Once the winter was over the ozone layer would be damaged  and the planet saturated with ultaviolet light from the sun. Others argue  that people would survive somewhere, not everyone would die from  radiation.<br />Whatever the case, &quot;On the Beach&quot; is still a  powerful book. It makes you wonder how you would feel, knowing how you were  going to die and when. The Australians are fortunate in that they are  offered suicide pills for when the pain becomes too much. People aren't so  worried about nuclear war any more. But on the news this morning I saw  Boris Yeltsin remind Bill Clinton that they still have a nuclear arsenal.  This was after Clinton threatened Russia with sanctions if Russian forces  attacked Grozny... But we've managed to avoid nuclear war up until now, so  there's probably nothing to worry about. Is there?	1999-12-09

It's one of the many stories that imagines life after the nuclear holocaust. An American girl called Ann Burden is alone in a valley. A haven protected from radiation,  it is the perfect place to survive.<br />The novel is written like a diary.  One day Ann writes of a stranger who comes to the valley. He wears what  looks like a greenish space suit, which protects him from radiation. Who is  the man? Is he friend or foe? Ann asks these questions in her diary. She  makes friends with the man, whose name is Loomis. But there is something  sinister and secretive about him...<br />When I first heard of this book I  found the idea of a valley being free of radiation a bit improbable. Two  years earlier I had read &quot;On the Beach&quot; (1957) by Nevil Shute.  That book imagined everyone dying from radiation, no matter where they  were. No one survived. Understandably I was depressed. &quot;Z For  Zachariah&quot; is a bit more hopeful, but I think there have been other  books of the same genre that are better.<br />In 1984 &quot;Z For  Zachariah&quot; was dramatized for television, and starred Anthony Andrews  as Mr Loomis. For some reason the story was set in England instead of  America.	1999-12-08

Adam Jeffson is the only man left. He spends years looking for other people, wandering through the remains of civilization.<br />One of  the benefits of being the last man on Earth is that you would have the  freedom to do whatever you want. The planet would be literally yours. Adam  takes advantage of this. He becomes more and more eccentric, travelling  around the world, burning cities to the ground. He wants to wipe out all  trace of humanity, to make it look as if the human race had never existed.  This could be put down to a symptom of Adam's growing madness - a madness  caused by enforced solitude. <br />The premise is a good one. &quot;The Purple  Cloud&quot; sounds like an HG Wells novel in style. The language is a bit  flowery, but I didn't mind that. (The book was published in the early  1900's after all.) When you read this book you  travel around the world  with Adam and find the same thing - emptyness, stillness, silence. How  would you cope?<br />In 1959 a film called &quot;The World, the Flesh and the  Devil&quot; was released. It was supposedley based on &quot;The Purple  Cloud&quot;, but it had nothing to do with MP Shiel's story.	1999-12-08

I read this book in 1992 when I was in Grade 11. (Not because I had to, I should add.) I saw the 1963 film first and this made me read the book. A group of English  schoolboys trapped on an island slowly turn into a horde of savages. Part  of the reason I read this book was in case it did become set reading for  our English class. It turned out to be an unnecessary exercise but I  enjoyed the book anyway. I actually envied the kids who had to read it the  following year for English. Listening to them complain that it's boring or  that they didn't understand it. (My class read &quot;1984&quot;, another  book I can recommend.) Avoid seeing the woeful 1990 film version of the  novel. Most of the original story is blatantly missing.	1999-12-07

Volcanoes and earthquakes brought civilization crashing down into ruins and permanently changed the planet. The survivors blamed this on the machines. Now people live in  separate medieval communities, worship Spirits and despise technology.  Anyone caught with a machine of any kind is killed.<br />In Winchester, young  Luke Perry is named Prince in Waiting by the Seers. Luke tells a tale of  treachury, murder, and intrigue. The Seers have chosen Luke for a special  mission...<br />This is a good story about friendship, loyalty, suspicion,  pride and belief. John Christopher writes about a superstitious society of  the future in a style that makes readers want to turn the page.	1999-12-03
US	50780673	R15CCA7XI7M3G1	0192714910	509001035	Brother in the Land	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Here today, gone tomorrow.	&quot;One minute everything was normal, and then it was gone.&quot; This is a first person account of life after a nuclear holocaust. The narrator is an English boy called Danny. He recounts all the things that have  happened to him since the holocaust and  the grim struggle that life has  become. This is a good book because it is written by someone who actually  experienced what happened. The narrator makes each day feel tense and  uncertain. Danny's life is grim, insecure and torturous. <br />One of the  interesting things about this book are the invented names used to describe  the various species of survivor: &quot;Goths&quot;, &quot;Spacers&quot;,  &quot;Terminals&quot;, &quot;Badgers&quot; and &quot;Purples&quot;. It's  the beginning of a new language. <br />Grief and despair pervade this book.  Nuclear weapons have utterly destroyed civilization, England has been  turned into a poisonous, desolate wasteland. The narrator has written this  account to warn future generations (if any) not to do it again.<br />When you  finish reading &quot;Brother in the Land&quot; read &quot;Riddley  Walker&quot; by Russell Hoban. That book is also a first person account by  a boy in post-holocaust England. Set thousands of years in the future, the  people live a primitive life with dim legends of the world as we know it.	1999-11-29
US	50780673	RM795CIA7QZLO	0194242323	414825953	Death of Grass (Alpha Books)	Books	5	26	27	N	N	Killing for the sake of Living	\\"The Death of Grass\\" is John Christopher's best known novel and probably the ultimate disaster story. The world is dying of starvation. Every kind of grass we need for food is being destroyed by a virus, resulting in carnage, anarchy and a rapid descent to barbarism. <br />In England, now a brown and unpleasant land, two of the principal characters learn of a government plan to depopulate the country. The only way to survive is to escape the hungry mobs and make it to a refuge in the countryside. <br />Like \\"Lord of the Flies\\", this story shows how civilized decency and good manners will easily slip away and expose the brutality within us when faced with a fight for survival.<br />John Christopher's writing reminds me of John Wyndham, another writer known for his end-of-the-world scenarios. \\"The Death of Grass\\" is a frightening story because in the beginning we identify with the people and their normality. As the book progresses the people become something less than human, but in the end we get a glimmer of hope.	1999-11-27

The sirens wail and people panic - war has suddenly broken out between East and West and the bombs are  falling. Very soon the war is over, and from that afternoon the world has  changed forever... <br />Louise Lawrence writes a convincing story about the  end of an old world and the start of a new one. There are three main  characters in the book: Sarah, Ophelia and Simon. Each of these characters  represent their respective generation. Through these  people we see how the  war has affected their lives and the world around them.<br />There have been  many stories written about nuclear war, and I think that out of the ones  I've read this is the most optimistic. It was the first book that made me  think that life could actually continue and even improve  after such an  horrific event. Apart from the obvious theme of war, the book makes you  think about issues like race, religion and evolution. Although this book is  aimed at a teenage audience, people of all ages can appreciate it.	1999-11-26

I was introduced to these books back in 1985, when I was 9. I was really taken with the cover artwork of &quot;The  White Mountains&quot;, which showed this giant three-legged machine and a  boy hiding in the foreground.<br />But I didn't actually read the books until  four years later. I was obsessed with it! I loved the idea of a small rebel  group fighting something that seemed so invincible. For ages I couldn't  draw a landscape without putting a Tripod in it! <br />These books got me  interested in cities and how they'd look when they're destroyed. One of my  favourite parts of the story is when the three boys are walking through the  ruins of an ancient city. We all know what city it was and  we recognise so  much that is unfamiliar to them.  It's both amusing and moving to see them  ponder over the relics of a better time.<br />These are a series of books I've  read over and over. The praise for this trilogy is well deserved.	1999-11-26
US	50780673	R3V3WHUWUODCBI	0385199570	825352881	The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition	Books	4	1	1	N	N	An old premise with a new twist	Out of the Stephen King novels I've read this is the one I enjoyed the most. As every reader of the book knows, a plague escapes a secret military base in California and kills nearly everyone in America. (And presumably the rest of the world.) This is not a new premise. Another book with the same theme is \\"Earth Abides\\" (1949) by George R Stewart. <br />However, in addition to the trauma of living in a devastated country, King has given the survivors something else to contend with: the evil Randall Flagg, often referred to as \\"the dark man\\" or the \\"walkin' dude.\\"<br />Part of the reason I read this novel was because I liked the sound of the plot when I read the back cover. Another reason was the challenge of embarking on a long, long story. The novel makes quite a few references to \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and there are some parallels between the two. (Apart from being long.) Those who have read \\"Night Shift\\" will know \\"The Stand\\" is an expansion of the short story \\"Night Surf\\", though there are some inconsistencies with the continuity. An unusual thing for a Stephen King novel are the addition of illustrations. As an aspiring illustrator I can say these are very well done, and help enhance the book. If you like post apocalypse literature and have the patience for King's descriptive writing then this is the book for you.	1999-11-26
US	50780673	R3M1KE1675RKH3	0671540661	927388564	The Shadow of the Torturer (Book of the New Sun, Vol. 1)	Books	5	17	18	N	N	An Alien World Called Urth	This first volume of &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot; establishes the setting of the overall story. It's a first person account told by Severian, who starts off as an apprentice torturor. He lives in the Matachin Tower  with the Torturor's Guild in the city of Nessus. He is soon exiled for  being merciful to one of his &quot;clients&quot; - a woman he had fallen in  love with. He has to make a journey to the city of Thrax, where he will  serve as the Lictor. &quot;The Shadow of the Torturor&quot; is the  beginning of that journey.<br />This story is set in a future so distant that  our own world is almost completely forgotten. All that remains of our  civilization are a few artifacts and legends. To Severian and the other  people of &quot;Urth&quot;, our own world is as ancient and remote as the  prehistoric age is to us. Urth is now an unbelievably old planet, circling  a dying sun. It is littered with the remains of past civilizations. New  plant and animal life exists of the strangest kinds. There are the relics  of technology so advanced they look like magic. <br />What I find so appealing  about this book is that Gene Wolfe succeeds in creating an alien world so  ancient, fantastic and magical that you often forget it's really our own  planet. The strange new people are distant descendents of us. Many of the  book's influences come from Jack Vance's &quot;The Dying Earth&quot;. When  reading &quot;The Shadow of the Torturor&quot; and the other books in this  series, you have to give it your complete attention to fully appreciate  what is happening. Sometimes it's tedious, but overall it's rewarding.  These books will challenge your observation.	1999-11-24
US	50780673	R11OTDW7X8HY5X	031286504X	486151984	I Am Legend	Books	5	7	7	N	N	The Besieged Outcast	Vampires are usually associated with supernatural or gothic fiction. &quot;I Am Legend&quot; was the first to go against this trend. In this novel Richard Matheson depicts vampirism as a disease and offers  explanations for its symptoms.<br />The main character is Robert Neville. He  is the only normal man (from our point of view) left in the world, after a  plague has turned everyone else into vampires. He spends his days growing  garlic, making stakes, and killing every vampire he can find. At night he  is a prisoner in his own home. He drinks himself into a stupor. He listens  to classical music, which he plays to drown out the screaming vampires who  gather outside his house.<br />This  is a good story because it delves into  the mental anguish of  isolation and the strength of human will. Even  though the hero can never hope for a normal life he is determined to  survive.<br />&quot;I Am Legend&quot; has been filmed twice. Ten years earlier  I saw the film &quot;The Omega Man&quot;. If you really liked the novel you  should probably avoid this film, as it bears only a slight resemblence to  the book's storyline. For one thing, there aren't any vampires!	1999-11-23

(Before that I was only reading Doctor Who tie-in's.) After seeing the BBC adaptation on TV I wanted to read this book. I got it when I was 11 and have cherished it ever  since. This was the book that made John Wyndham famous: the overnight  destruction of civilization by &quot;comet debris&quot;, the world overrun  by flesh-eating plants called triffids. <br />One could look at this book as a  war between man and nature on a grand scale. When mankind was the species  that dominated all others, nature was driven back, &quot;suppressed&quot;,  or killed in the name of progress. When the tables are suddenly turned, it  looks as if mankind is in decline. As the years pass,  dead  cities are  slowly disappearing, turning into jungles as nature takes hold. In a matter  of time nature will take over completely and the triffids will be the new  inheritors. Unless the human race can fight back and reassert itself.<br />I  have lost count of how many times I have read this book. I am  23 and the  story is just as effective now as it was when I first read it. I like  seeing all the different cover artwork that people have done for this book.  The fact that it's been reprinted so many times is proof that this novel  shows no sign of losing its popularity.	1999-11-22
