Should have maps and discussion of each 2004 stage - but has only a few brief descriptions of some of the climbs. Well written in plain English, hard to imagine this is the same gonzo who wrote Bobke II. What's the french word for ghost?	2004-06-13

First part is a sketchy outline of his diary for a few years. Rest of it is a hodgepodge of memories and rantings. He does have a wacky way of thinking and describing things. But, in a writing style and language that will likely appeal to 14 year old boys it has way too many nicknames, unnecessary swearing, nitwitticisms, etc. You have to be a hard core fan of his to give this book five or six stars. Maybe he has a good book in him but this isn't it.	2004-06-12

For me, the NIV makes it more readable and more easily understood. I can certainly understand some brothers and sisters who insist the KJV is the only way to go, but it can be hard reading. In addition, the study notes are great. It is a real blessing to be able to look on the same page and see the reference to background info, definitions, spiritual context, or the Jewish law or customs or any number of other study helps.  There are a lot of cross references, maps, etc. I have not noticed that the red type is difficult to read and giving it one star for that is a little harsh. Thanks to all the fine people who put this together.	2004-03-26

We take freedom for granted. People who have lived thru these nightmares appreciate freedom in a way we never will. In these stories you see that the greatest mistreatment often comes from their own families or neighbors - who are all afraid of not conforming. This fear crushes even the smallest amount of human decency towards one another. The author is sent to a work camp for 18 months for buying fresh flowers. Someone decided its not correct this year, but then it is politically ok next year. Pu Ning is the only really free citizen around. He was willing to go to jail, prison and workcamps for not working and not conforming. We now see this kind of politically correct thought in our colleges. Once bastions of free speech, college professors now worship at the altar of conformity to hard core liberalism or are cast out. There are still millions of people in slave labor camps in China. Remember that anything you buy that was made in China is paid for by their pain and misery.	2003-10-16

His writing was going downhill then and now he is complete. He is mocking, sniggering, back-stabbing and complaining the whole time. He is nastily anti-Christian and insults them to their face and in print. He makes snide remarks about people who go to Africa to see the animals, &quot;pestering&quot; in his words, and then hypocritically proceeds to go to a luxury resort that few of us could afford and .... sees the animals. Theroux is an elitist who looks down his nose at most of the rest of us. Lots of tedious passages in this book, reading about this breakdown, that flat tire, etc.<br />Only valuable part of this book is the heartbreaking view of the poverty in Africa that is being made worse, not better, by the aid we have been sending. There are other books that are worth reading. This is the last book of his I will buy and I used to be a real fan.	2003-04-18

I must admit I was surprised by this description of a marine's life. They live a very strange warrior's existence of alcohol, prostitutes and toughness bordering on the brutish. Don't buy this book if profanity shocks you. It is full of it. Something of a letdown when he finally gets to the gulf war. It is over before he does much. Doesn't really match up to some of the Viet Nam books/novels, one of the best being the autobiography - Chickenhawks.	2003-04-12

First half is almost boring, and I almost quit three quarters of the way thru. He stretches the book with a lot of non-essential househusband whining which the feminists will love. Science is too farfetched and his descriptions of the mechanics of the factory are difficult to follow. You keep wishing a decent sized dinosaur would show up and give the book some energy.	2003-02-09

Employees believed they had a right to play around and still get paid. They were owed a lifetime job. Managers were frightened to death of actually disciplining anyone. Personnel dept would make your life miserable. Plus you would become known as someone who can't manage effectively. Fire someone?, forget it. First thing I learned when I made manager was never fire anybody. Just wait till you can unload them on someone else. <br />IBM socialism meant that the sales offices constantly played around with quotas. So you never got really hurt, and you never really made big money. So why put out the effort? You weren't going to get fired. <br />The [...] labs could care less what the market needed. They would play around with stuff until they had perfected it that last 1%. The fact that it would come out 6 months late and 20% overpriced never bothered them. Sales reps didn't sell what made a profit, they sold what had the most sales points attached.<br />I don't think this is a great book but it is interesting and easy to read. And it is absolutely true that IBM needed someone to shake it violently by the collar to make it pay attention to the crisis. All the other reviwers whining about the changes remind me of all the people I knew at IBM who were in denial....\\"if we just wait a little longer... everything will be all right\\". Like it or not someone had to radically change the Company we all loved.<br />Even though I lucked out and took the first buyout, I wish I still worked there. There is something about being an IBMer.	2003-01-28

She is an anthropologist and she documents and writes like an anthropologist. She casts a keen anthropologist's eye on the culture and how people act and interact. May well be too detailed for some people. I know I got a little bogged down in the last third of the book. But, really answers a lot of questions about the whole process including the trainers, dressers, wig stylists, kimono makers, etc. And I think she does a good job of updating the fact that the Geisha are a lot different now than they were even ten or twenty years ago. They've become pretty modern and the girls are much more in control of their lives. I've read 2 or 3 other books on Geisha and this is the best and most comprehensive by far.	2002-11-26

But a little too much of I walked down the street, I petted the dog, I bought a ruler. Was hoping for more insight into the Japanese culture and how the Geisha, Geiko, Maiko culture developed. Plus, she blew the whole thing off and became a civilian. But, still readable and interesting.	2002-11-12

They had a 2 hour special on this subject. The Israelis knew the Liberty was there because they had been sending msgs to the US Navy telling them to get it out of there. The signals got misrouted and delayed. The program surmises that the Israelis didn't want the US knowing how far they were actually going to go into Syria. There are pictures of the ship with the name clearly marked. There are pictures of the ship with a US flag clearly displayed. Most damming, Israeli gunboats came out and shelled the ship... circling as they did so. They knew exactly whose ship it was. Johnson and McNamara (2 cowards of international stature) held up rescue planes from the fleet because they thought it was the Russians and they were afraid of starting WW3. After the attack Johnson ordered the ship into dry dock and all signs of damage were repaired. All the crew were told if they ever talked they would be court martialed. These events are important to me because the day before I was sitting in a USAF C130, 100 miles off the coast, listening to the Egyptian pilots. We considered ourselves lucky that the Israelis didn't decide to take us out too. I guess it would have been more difficult to explain.	2002-08-09

This book bounces between the author's own trip.. which is not particularly interesting... and very brief histories of what Roman tourists were experiencing in the same places. Don't know where he got his info about the Romans but often seems like it is just copied out of some local travel brochure or a history book from the library.

I think there is something of a credibility problem. For instance, going for days without water in the Gobi desert isn't supposed to be physically possible. At least it wasn't when I went thru survival school. Maybe it could happen but just too many amazing feats of endurance for me. As fiction, it's a fair read.	2002-03-06

Everyone talks about Jefferson being a genius but I think Ben could match him in every category. If he had been younger he would certainly have been one of our presidents. His role in bluffing the Brits to give up and go home is very interesting. During his time he was the most famous person in the western world, but he remained relatively humble and personable. Towards the end, because of Franklin's international fame, a visitor recounts that he expected that he would be ushered into Ben's presence like being presented to a king. Instead, he and a friend found a kindly old man sitting under a tree with his grandkids underfoot. At the last page you feel like you have lost a friend.	2001-01-27

He is well educated, highly intelligent, and it  shows in his writing. Many wry phrases sneak into this book, &quot;The  driver cried out for in&quot;.

You get a very brief one or two page  article about each country. You don't really learn much about the author,  the country, or motorcycling.<br />He is also an American hater. Whining about  how we ravaged the Indians, the buffalo, etc. He is drawn to the poverty of  third worlders and disgusted by the plenty of the American lifestyle.  Hiroshima is a tragedy but no mention of Pearl Harbor.<br />Like a lot of  Europeans he hates America but forgets if it wasn't for us he would be  goosestepping around the platz every morning.	2000-08-03
