US	35073290	RYP35LA2BC3SO	0385721420	120680919	Three Junes	Books	4	6	9	N	N	Great first effort for an Author	I picked up &quot;Three Junes&quot; reluctantly.  Julia Glass is a highly-literate writer, and (not to insult myself), I'm a reader looking for escapism and romance.  I tend to like to have anything and everything spelled out for me (Danielle Steel).  In short, I read for pleasure, and am easily distracted, as I read, usually in crowded lobbies, waiting rooms etc..  So, I need something that's easy to tap into, as well as put down and pick up at many intervals.<br />These are edgy characters, too, in &quot;Three Junes&quot;, with clever and sometimes vague dialogue. <br />However, I was able to follow along with the characters and the often-times complex descriptions author Julia Glass writes.  Part of it is my familiarity with the setting (Scotland) that author Julia Glass writes about.  I've read a lot of Rosamunde Pilcher, a romance author who also uses Scotland as a setting.<br />&quot;Three Junes&quot; is essentially about the life of Fenno McLoed, who grew up in Scotland, but immigrated to NYC.<br />The novel is told in 3 parts.  Part one tells about Fenno and his Scottish family in first person, narrated by his Father.  In part 2, Fenno, himself, takes over the narration.  And, Part 3 is done in third person, by entirely new characters, who are acquainted with Fenno later on in his life.<br />This is a very clever way of telling the story of one man's life, and full of observations, reflections, inferences about what it's like to be an ex-patriate from another country:  Scotland.<br />Again, anyone who reads a lot of Rosamunde Pilcher, might like this.  Pilcher is from that Northern England Countryside area known as Scotland, and writes frequently about the Scots.  However, Rosamunde Pilcher is a romance novelist, and &quot;Three Junes&quot; is not romance.<br />It's basically just a highly-literate, clever, and sometimes edgy (jargon) story of a Scottish family and their imperfections. There is a strong sense of movement and the passage of time, as main character Fenno travels back and forth between Scotland and NYC for various deaths in his family.<br />It's not a novel for everybody, as there's not a lot of action/adventure, and given the avant-garde, quirky dialogue.  But, Julia Glass thoroughly explores and explains her characters, and I was willing to stay with it till the end.  I must say, Julia Glass has a bright future, considering she'd never written a novel before.	2004-06-10
US	35073290	RO08TW07N1SQN	1400042070	669988222	The Amateur Marriage: A Novel	Books	2	7	15	N	N	Is good writing enough ????	Anne Tyler is a very good writer.  Let's get that out of the way to begin with.<br />Unfortunately, it's the kind of writing that I'm not the least bit interested; but again, it is highly literate writing.<br />Make no mistake, I like highly literate writers: Richard Russo, John Updike, Susan Vreeland, Barbara Kingsolver.  But those writers all have/had lovable characters in their novels.<br />With Anne Tyler, as good a writer as she is, her characters not only are unlikeable, they are unrelatable. I'll give a writer a pass for thin, or non-existent, plots----and believe me----the plot in &quot;Amateur Marriage&quot; is non-existent.   For me, as a reader, the most important thing is that, I have to be able to relate, and want to relate, in order to appreciate the good writing.<br />And believe me, when it comes to author Anne Tyler, I've tried.  I struggled through the first 100 pages of &quot;Back When We Were Grown-ups&quot;, and finally gave up----as the middle-aged woman in &quot;Grown-ups&quot; was too quirky, strange, and downright boring--with no explanation.....that I just didn't care enough to continue.<br />So, with Anne Tyler's &quot;Amateur Marriage&quot;, I was determined to give Tyler a fair shake and, at least, finish the novel.  Well, I finished, all right; and now I'm determined never to read Anne Tyler again.<br />Tyler takes you through some 60 or 70 years in the life of spouses Pauline and Michael Anton:  How they met as teenagers, through their raising children, the war, their grandchildren etc...<br />They have a miserable marriage, or do they?  There are lots of squabbles and quarrels etc..  ok , and... so what?  Welcome to the world of marriage.  Sort of like Fred and Ethel on I Love Lucy.  But what makes author Anne Tyler think that this makes for compelling drama?  There's really no emotional urgency here, as the characters don't seem to express emotions or conflicts, even though Anne Tyler writes beneath the surface.  So, if you are looking for high drama.... forget it!<br />The daughter, &quot;Lindy&quot; runs away from home.  I don't blame her.  I wanted to run away from this story.  Plus, as good as the ending might be, &quot;Lindy&quot; is another empty character.  And, the readers never find out why Lindy ran away, or where she'd been for 36 years.  Reminds me of author Sue Miller &quot;While I was gone&quot;.  Sue Miller--- another author who I can never get through and dislikeable characters.  Both Sue Miller and Anne Tyler, as authors, tend to toss around lots of edgy-quirky characters, but with very few explanations, reflections, or resolutions.<br />&quot;Amateur Marriage&quot; spans several decades and generations.  However, Rona Jaffe does better at marking the passages of time in her novels.<br />Anne Tyler just doesn't have enough evocative emotional urgency in her characterizations for me to continue reading her work.	2004-06-10

I disliked the over-used theme of a woman finding out that her husband had a secret life.<br />The whole novel is about trying to uncover what happened to Bay McCabe's missing husband.  But, this theme has been so over-used in, say, Barbara Delinsky's &quot;A Woman Betrayed&quot;  to Anita Shreve's &quot;Pilot's Wife&quot;.<br />Still, Luanne Rice is a very evocative writer who writes great characters who become your friends, and a wonderful setting, even if you hate the plot.	2004-05-19

The writing and descriptions of the scenery make up for a lot of plot shortcomings.<br />The plot of this is that overused....What-has-my-missing-husband-been-hiding-that-I-didn't-know-about.......theme.<br />This was very similar to the plot of Barbara Delinsky's \\"A Woman Betrayed\\" and Anita Shreve's \\"Pilot's Wife\\"....where the wife discovers her husband's secret life and his being caught up in all sorts of sordid criminal doings.<br />Maybe Luanne Rice was still wanting to expound on the crime themes she'd started in her \\"Secret Hour.\\"  Because of this, I can really only give \\"Perfect Summer\\" three stars.<br />Still, if you are addicted to \\"Hubbard's Point\\", the beautiful writing about that setting, and wonderful friendships---which are a Luanne Rice specialty, this is a must-read.	2004-05-19

It's probably a three star novel at best; however, I just love anything to do with sailing, nautical themes, water, fish, etc.. and &quot;Safe Harbor&quot; is all about that.<br />I really felt like I was on that sailboat right along with Quinn and Allie Grayson, two teenage sisters recently orphaned,  as they sailed from Long Island Sound to Martha's Vinyard in stormy weather......as the boat capsizes!!!!  Do they survive?  Read on!<br />Luanne Rice's writing about ocean and sea is so wonderful that you do feel right there, even though there's nothing particular urgent in terms of actual plot twists.  That's ok, because Luanne Rice is really a writer for whom you visit to check in with good friends and their day-to-day life, which is what this book is.<br />This book is important if you are going to be reading Luanne Rice's &quot;True Blue&quot; (which came after &quot;Safe Harbor&quot;) as the character of &quot;Quinn Grayson&quot; is featured extensively in both &quot;True Blue&quot; and here, &quot;Safe Harbor&quot;.<br />Luanne Rice does very well going inside the mind of a teenager in grief from her parent's death, and being raised by her Aunt &quot;Dana&quot; Underhill.<br />And, all of this takes place on the wonderful &quot;Hubbard's Point&quot;, an idyllic seaside Connecticut town that author Luanne Rice began setting about the last 7 of her novels in.	2004-05-19
US	35073290	RR7CUUXZLQEX5	0553802240	670999630	The Secret Hour	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Crime Drama from a Romance novelist	I don't think author Luanne Rice really pulls off the suspense/crime element here, but still, she is such a good writer that I'll probably read anything she does.<br />Although this novel sort of takes place in the Hubbard's Point/Black Hall vicinity that Luanne Rice usually sets her novels in.......none of the same characters repeat the way they usually do from her other novels.  <br />A Lawyer who defends serial killers on death row may have information about &quot;Kate's&quot; sister who is missing, as one of the killer's may, or may not have killed a special sister.<br />Luanne Rice's wonderfully descriptive and evocative writing about seaside towns, the nature of sisterhood, the pain of death, and children's point of view.....are featured throughout the first 3/4's of &quot;Secret Hour&quot;.<br />But, the last 3 chapters are where the suspense really picks up.  There is no real action or suspense until then, so I am only going to give this 3 stars for not really being as action-packed as I was lead to believe.<br />I still think she is a great writer, though, and I am a dedicated Luanne Rice reader, no matter what.	2004-05-19

You might be lost if you hadn't read &quot;Safe Harbor&quot;.  <br />The last 7 of Luanne Rice's novels have taken place in the seaside Connecticut town of &quot;Hubbard's Point&quot; with some of the same characters reappearing, but never to the extent that &quot;Quinn&quot; does, here, in &quot;True Blue&quot;.<br />I'm giving it 3 stars because I thought the novel was a little too melancholy and lacked urgency in the plot twists, what little there are.<br />Still there is lots of imaginative ocean and seaside writing as Quinn goes through her daily, lobstering, crabbing, oystering, etc... along the shoreline.<br />The main character of Rumor Larkin is interesting because she is a veterinarian who is attracted to an astronaut, Zebulon Mayhew----where does Luanne Rice get these names?<br />Anyway, both Rumor and Zeb were next door neighbors who'd sit out on the roof of his home when they were kids, as astronaut, Zeb, would watch the stars.  Rumor was land, and Zeb was sky.  So corny and goofy-romantic.<br />But is this enough to make a plot? <br />It's certainly enough to make for evocative and poignant writing, which is a Luanne Rice staple, which is why I'm a dedicated fan of her novels, no matter how much they lack page-turning suspense.	2004-05-19

However, it isn't quite as gripping plotwise, as the original &quot;Class Reunion&quot;.  I don't want to give the plot away, because it is just fascinating how they all end up.  However, the ending seemed incomplete in that not everyone's life was tied up and set.<br />I think that Rona should have a third sequal which takes the four college graduates into menopause.  In her later books, Road Taken, and Room-Mating season, she certainly takes her characters into old-age!<br />But, this is definitely one of the better Rona Jaffe novels, and absolutely required once you finish &quot;Class Reunion&quot;.	2004-03-07

Ophelie, the main character is not the brightest bulb on the block, and the reader becomes exasperated with this main character, no matter what her plight, who refuses to get on with it!  This main character here, is very similar to the one in Danielle's  &quot;Answered Prayers&quot;, only we don't have the snotty, adult, daughters of that other novel, to keep things interesting.  The daughter here is 8-10 year-old &quot;Pip&quot;, and it's kind of hard for the main character to have meaningful dialogue with an 8-year-old, that can hold the reader's interest.<br />It could have been an interesting story but for the fact of the plodding action/plot.<br />The &quot;homeless&quot; element feels thrown in.  And, Danielle Steel certainly doesn't explore homelessness with any depth whatsoever.<br />Danielle Steel is a good writer, though, still.  I'm currently reading &quot;Ransom&quot; and loving it.  &quot;Dating Game&quot; was very funny and innovative.  I would say skip this one and read either of those other two.	2004-03-07

I'm baffled as to why some of the other reviewers don't like this novel.  And, believe me, I haven't always liked everything Rona Jaffe has done.  Jaffe's &quot;Five Women&quot; was awful, and her &quot;The Cousins&quot; was only average, if not marginal.<br />But Jaffe again hits the jackpot with &quot;The Room-Mating Season&quot;, as it is just as good as her last novel, &quot;The Road Taken.&quot;  I easily had &quot;The Room-Mating Season&quot; finished in less that a week.  Actually I could have devoured it in one sitting, and there were times I had to force myself to put it down.  I like to pace myself in my reading, but this novel is un-put-down-able.<br />Just as with &quot;Road Taken&quot;.....&quot;Room-Mating Season&quot; spans a good chunk of time in the character's lives.  Well, &quot;Road Taken&quot; spanned a whole century.  But still, &quot;the Room-Mating Season&quot; tells the story of 38 years in the lives of 3 NYC roommates and their mysterious male bachelor friend, as they all make their lives and go from their 20s to their 60s, against the backdrop of the many decades (1960's, 70's 80s 90s) right up to the new Millenium. <br />The setting of NYC plays a very important role, as Rona Jaffe has her finger on the pulse of the City at every turn.  She also has an uncanny knack for moving a plot along swiftly with the right amount of dialog to narration.<br />Many of the characters drift in an out of a series of extra-marital affairs.  Rona Jaffe, as an author, does tend to normalize dysfunctional behavior.  I can put up with it in most of Jaffe's novels, such as &quot;Road Taken&quot;, and &quot;Room-Mating Season&quot; because; 1.  The characters are so humorous and lovable, and 2.  Jaffe is such an expert storyteller and chronicler of the times.<br />There were several times when the characters act so stupid and are running around in NYC circles, that I just had to laugh out loud.  The reader can accept it though, because Jaffe's characters are vulnerable and likeable. I say an author can get away with nearly anything if their characters are relateable, loveable, and likeable enough to the reader.<br />Was there anything I didn't like?  Yes.  The ending.  I was stunned when, as I neared the end, and the story was winding down...Jaffe threw a new twist in. An author does not want to throw in new twists and turns into the novel, just as the story is finishing up....leaving the reader with new questions.<br />However, this was such a small part of the endlessly fascinating story, that I can overlook it.  With Rona Jaffe's hysterical, (there were many times I was laughing out loud) characters that are written in such an extraordinarily insightful and intelligent way, I just have to give this novel 5 stars.	2003-09-21

This novel is too short for the reader to become involved and sufficiently engrossed enough in the story.  With romances, and especially a romance that spans over 50 years, the reader needs time....and text.  There are too many ideas that have been cut-off for the sake of editing, as Nicholas Sparks readily confesses.  In all fairness, this was Nicholas Sparks first novel, and he did feel pressure to bring it in under a certain amount of pages....which may have suited his publishers and editor, but leaves the reader very unsatisfied.<br />In general, when you are spanning the decades in a sweeping romantic saga, you cannot put the story into one of the shorter novels, without ideas becoming half-expressed and squelched, and there are many half-expressed thoughts that the reader longs to be fleshed out more, especially when the characters are so memorable and the story so touching.  Whole chunks of time are missing and glossed over, leaving a feeling of incompleteness.<br />I can make allowances due to this being Sparks, first novel.  And, I am looking forward to the sequal &quot;The Wedding&quot; which is currently in publication.<br />What's good here is the love between the two senior citizens, even though there aren't enough scenes of it.  The book drags a bit through the first part, until you get to the part where they are seniors and absolutely cannot put it down.  I just wish that would've been the whole part, or significantly more.<br />Not enough authors focus on senior issues, or even whether seniors' romantic love is  just as valid as young love.  The fact that Nicholas Sparks was willing to delve into this is wonderful, and he beautifully captures the feelings of the elderly in love.<br />I just hope the sequel  to the &quot;Notebook&quot;.....the current &quot;The Wedding&quot; , by Nicholas Sparks, fills in some of the gaps that were edited out here.	2003-09-21

Everything you love about Barabara Delinsky's writing is here in her latest novel, plus some bonuses.  This is the first time, well, since &quot;A Woman Next Door,&quot; that she has written something you cannot put down.  There is suspense, mystery, complex emotional issues, right to life issues, small towns, incest, child molestation, ghosts, suicide, aging parents, grief, etc.. plus much, much more.  And, all these themes are tied together beautifully.<br />I rarely give Delinsky 5 stars, but I can see &quot;Flirting With Pete&quot; is a first-rate effort. It really is one of Delinsky's best, if not the best she has ever written.<br />Was there anything I didn't like?  I think she gets a little too technical with the medical stuff.  An author needs to make sure a novel isn't coming off like a textbook in explanation.  However, I am interested in medical stuff, and nature/gardening, so it wasn't that boring for me. That's the problem:  if the subject is maple syrup, or apple cider making, and you couldn't care in the least, then getting too technical is a problem.<br />But, here, the whole gardening/flowers aspect of this novel works because there is a sense of nature that parallels the gripping plot.  I really got a strong sense of the sprawling three-tiered garden setting, and the multi-level Beacon Hill townhouse that much of this story takes place in.  Delinsky's characterization and insight into her characters moods and feelings is so nuanced and precise, I felt like the characters were in the room with me.<br />I did, however, think the cover was a bit too much and gimmicky.  But, so what?  I don't rate based on a cover and I couldn't care less what's on the jacket.  What matters is what's between the covers, and Delinsky has absolutely outdone herself on this novel.<br />One thing that Delinsky does right is to throw in her twists all throughout this novel--unlike some authors (Nicholas Sparks) who make you wait until the very end until the payoff.  Delinsky throws in a series of payoffs all throughout her novel, giving the reader some immediate satisfaction, as well as hooking the reader early-on.  I'm serious, once you get to the final eight chapters, you will absolutely not be able to put this one down, and I'm usually a slow reader and like to pace myself, but I easily had this done in less than a week.<br />Anyone who liked Delinsky's &quot;Three Wishes&quot; is sure to like &quot;Flirting With Pete&quot;.  Also Delinsky's writing is as good as Anita Shreve's and similar in tone to the writing in Anita Shreve's &quot;The Last Time They Met&quot; and Anita Shreve's &quot;The Weight of Water&quot;.  All of those novels had two parallel stories going on which rapidly careen, collide, and intersect in gripping plot twists.  Delinsky brilliantly uses foreshadowing ala Anita Shreve, and creates a sense of urgency in the plots, all done through character, making this effort of Barbara Delinsky's so much more than a &quot;romance&quot;.  I think Delinsky has proven herself, with &quot;Flirting With Pete,&quot; to be one of the most accomplished mainstream writers, right up there with the best of fiction writers such as Anita Shreve and Richard Russo(Empire Falls).<br />I've read at least 12 or 13 different novels by Barbara Delinsky, and this is unlike anything I've ever come across from her.  Bravo!	2003-09-02

These three daughters spend much of this novel complaining about their Mother.  This story is very similar to &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot; but with 3 spoiled and whining daughters who have no business interrogating their 70-year-old mother about her life before they were even born.<br />What business is it of theirs what &quot;Ginny&quot; the mother did before the daughters were around?  Delinsky is very repetitive here, constantly reminding the reader that mother &quot;Ginny&quot; was emotionally unavailable, (cry me a river) yet the St. Clair sisters never wanted for material goods and grew up quite wealthy.  We are supposed to feel sorry for these spoiled kids?<br />There are some very poignant chapters, here, though, as Delinsky writes about Ginny's (the 70-year-old mothers) death. There's very little about the daughters mourning their mother's death, though.  How typical of these 3 Ingrates.  Delinsky does add variety to her writing by switching from 1st and 3rd person in some of the chapters.<br />There's also a couple of &quot;inter-chapters&quot; about some of the old townsfolk sitting on their porch reminiscing about the way the small town in Maine, where the three daughters reunite.....used to be. These are interspersed with the story chapters. These &quot;interchapters&quot; don't seem to have any connection to the story at hand, though.  I was confused about who these old townspeople were and how they were related to the daughters and their dying mother.<br />I'm taking one star off for this confusion, and one star off for the insufferable grown children who have a major chip on their shoulders.<br />Many readers who are familiar with Delinsky know that her characters have &quot;mother&quot; problems and the charcters always call their mothers by the mother's first name.  But, usually there is some major reason or gripe for the mother-daughter conflict in a Barbara Delinsky novel.<br />I just don't see it, here, in this novel.<br />I just don'tsee what the conflict was, here, though.  The daughters all grew up to be very accomplished and well-off.  So what was all the complaining and squabbling about?	2003-08-27
US	35073290	R3L8EMQ52UNZVI	0061040932	358684733	The Passions of Chelsea Kane	Books	3	4	18	N	N	Too much s-e-x  distracts from the story!	Of course, author Barbara Delinsky, started her writing career with Harlequin; so, obviously there are going to be sex scenes in her novels.  This was one of the older novels, which came out in 1992 as a paperback, perhaps before she began writing mainstream hard-cover fiction.  For this reason, I can make some allowances, owing to the genre of that time, and the title of course, \\"Passions of Chelsea Kane\\" is certainly not going to be about a nun in a convent.<br />However, it gets irritating after awhile.  Central character Chelsea Kane casually sleeps with her childhood friend, just to see if they are compatible.  They are not.  Oh well.  Chelsea then moves to a small town in New England where the whole rest of the novel seems to be pre-occupied with Chelsea's lusty thoughts for one of the granite workers at the town quarry she has just bought. Scene after scene of gratuitous sex, even during Chelsea's pregnancy, yuck.  And, even hints at sex during her breast-feeding, double yuck.  Chelsea had arrived in the small New England town pregnant, and doesn't even bother having her new lover take an AIDs test, which could have injured her unborn child, I would think.  There was AIDs in 1992, so I feel author, Barbara Delinsky was very irresponsible making pregnant Chelsea Kane so promiscuous, whether it serves the plot or not.<br />Why did Chelsea purchase a granite factory in a small-town of New England?  Chelsea was adopted as a child and she is now looking for her birth-parents who came out of that town.  She is an architect and granite gives her a reason to get involved with the small town to see if she can find her parents amongst the townspeople.<br />All the quarrying for granite stuff is about as interesting as the maple-sugaring stuff in Delinsky's \\"Accidental Woman\\" novel.  The problem with writing so technical about these crafts is that if the reader is simply not interested in maple syrup, gardening, grape-growing, or quarrying........the whole novel will bea big bore.<br />Delinsky is not so great at suspense and mystery either.  The reader can easily guess who Chelsea's surprise parents will be.  The ending of this long-drawn out novel is pretty lackluster as too many clues were handed out long before and there really aren't much surprises.<br />What is good here is the narrow-mindedness of the small-town attitudes.  Delinsky is an expert at capturing the feel of small New England towns and the petty and small attitudes of the townspeople towards urbane Chelsea Kane. There are some great scenes of the long-time denizens of small-town Norwitch Notch arguing with city-dweller, Chelsea, as the townspeople simply do not want her there and try to run her out of town. In fact, I would go so far as to say that author Barbara Delinsky's small town \\"Norwich Notch\\" in this novel, which she custom-created, is about as expertly defined as \\"Empire Falls\\" was in Pulitzer Prize winning novelist Richard Russo's \\"Empire Falls\\" novel----which won the Pulitzer in 2001.<br />Both Richard Russo \\"Empire Falls\\" and Barbara Delinsky are perhaps the best in all of fiction at creating accurate New England small towns.<br />However, I'm still going to take one star off for the bizarre sex scenes.  And, one star off for all the boring stuff about granite and quarrying.	2003-07-11

The sense of movement, action, and adventure is very prevalent here, as divorcee, Paris Armstrong, endures being dumped by her long-time husband, moving cross-country, forging a new life, enduring several typical flaky \\"California\\" type men as dates (very realistic), and through it all, keeping her sense of humor.<br />This has got to be the funniest Danielle Steel I have read in a long time.  What else is new here?  A gay subplot.  Yes, you heard correctly. I can't remember a Danielle Steel novel ever featuring gay characters.  All right, there was a little blurb, right at the end of \\"The Wedding\\" about lesbianism---but not the somewhat in-depth treatment gays and AIDs gets here in \\"Dating Game.\\" <br />Danielle Steel hasn't had San Francisco as a setting for one of her novels in a while.  Well, at least not since 1999's awful \\"Irresistible Forces.\\"  Danielle Steel actually lives in the town, so if there's anyone who knows San Francisco, and can write with authority on the town and it's wacky eligible bachelors, it's Danielle Steel.<br />\\"Dating Game\\" is quite  a page-turner and quite a happy novel as you follow along with Paris and her San Francisco dating adventures.  It's fun to try to guess which parts of this novel are autobiographical, as Danielle Steel has talked about her own return into the San Francisco dating world, and how she based this book on her own personal adventures.<br />It's incredible that after all these years Steel can still turn out fresh and invigorating ideas when she wants to.  I place \\"Dating Game\\" with my other recent Danielle Steel favorites: \\"The Wedding\\" and \\"Lone Eagle.\\"  I also, somewhat enjoyed \\"Sunset In St. Tropez\\"  and \\"Answered Prayers.\\"<br />I look forward to reading Danielle Steel's \\"Johnny Angel\\" next, as I see this author has still has some talent in her yet!	2003-07-10
US	35073290	RYL1B3I5KVTEE	0061040347	64637040	A Woman Betrayed	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Spoilers! Spoilers! A bad ending wrecks the whole novel!	The whole premise of this Barbara Delinsky novel, is that the reader wants to find out what happens to Laura Frye's husband.  The book opens with central character  Laura Frye's husband abandoning her, and as the book closes, Laura's husband is still on the run, (he's running from the Authorities on a Tax Fraud charge, but also wanted out of the marriage) but has simply changed his name.<br />I'm not saying this woudn't be a worthwhile read for hardcore Delinsky fans.  But it seemed like nothing was tied up at the end.  There is no real payoff for making it through this rather longer Delinsky novel.   I just don't know how wise it is to construct a long novel around a single problem, drag your readers endlessly and repetitively through that problem, right up till the end, and then not even satisfactorily tie things up in a definite manner.  I like a definite and absolute happy ending, like in Barbara Delinsky's 1998 novel \\"Coast Road\\".<br />In all fairness, this was an earlier effort of Delinsky's written in 1991, and it was one of those straight-to-paperback novels written before Delinsky was even writing hardbacks.  <br />There are some situations that are hard to believe here, also.  For instance, central character, Laura, is not only betrayed by her missing husband, but also by her best friend, Daphne.  Delinsky didn't provide enough back-story on, what seemed to me, to be a very together lady-lawyer (Daphne) and how it was that she (Daphne) a smart and educated lawyer, could come to seem so flaky by the end of the novel via her \\"betrayal\\" of central character, Laura.<br />Even Laura's Mother comes across as cold and unfeeling towards her daughter during this tragic time.  Does everyone and anyone simply have it in for poor Laura?  Well, not everyone.  Certainly not Laura's lusty brother-in-law, for whom Laura engages in a steamy affair with.  This is a Barbara Delinsky novel, and an early one at that, so you know there are going to be racy sex scenes.  Couldn'tdo without those.<br />Again, I would say this is not one of the better Delinsky novels, those being:  \\"Three Wishes\\" \\"Coast Road\\" and \\"Shades of Grace\\"---all which are much better reads than \\"A Woman Betrayed\\".	2003-07-10
US	35073290	R4QX6FF5U3A5	0446527793	332456280	The Guardian (Sparks, Nicholas)	Books	2	1	4	N	N	Read &quot;Bend in the Road&quot; instead!	Nicholas Sparks's previous novel, &quot;Bend in the Road&quot; was far more suspenseful and emotional.  It was also shorter.  My problem with Nicholas Sparks writing is that the characters are so dull.  The writing is good in the &quot;Guardian&quot; but it felt very repetitive.  His writing at times seems interchangeable with Danielle Steel's.<br />And, yet Nicholas Sparks does not provide the glamour or sophistocation of typical Danielle Steel characters.  In his effort to be universal, Nicholas Sparks's characters suffer from a lack of flamboyance, eccentricity, or anything that makes them unique.  Even the villian, a stalker, in the &quot;Guardian&quot; comes off as comical.<br />Um, and that's not good, I would say..... when, I, the reader am finding the suspenseful parts far more humorous than scary.<br />The &quot;Guardian&quot; falls off as a romance since it is so dull and generic.  And, it fails as a thriller, mainly because all the suspense is left for the end of the novel.  All right, yes, there is a payoff, for sticking with the &quot;Guardian&quot; till the end.  I should hope so, after all the mindless drivel and filler that Sparks takes up excess pages with.<br />Thing is, Dean Koontz and Stephen King, at least, throw in red herrings all throughout their thrillers.  Not so with Sparks's &quot;The Guardian&quot;.  Here, you have to wait till the cliched end to get the payoff.  I was surprised I even made it till the end since the middle part was so dull.<br />With Sparks's previous thriller,  &quot;Bend in the Road&quot; you simply cannot put that one down as you don't know what to expect or who even, (Bend in the Road) the culprit is.   As opposed to the &quot;Guardian&quot; where Sparks reveals the culprit and you are then waiting till the end to see this Villian get caught.<br />Still, if you are a Nicholas Sparks fan, you might want to stick it out till the end.  Someone who has never read Sparks, I could see liking this.  Those of us who have read and loved both Sparks's &quot;Bend in the Road&quot;, and &quot;Walk to Remember&quot; know better.	2003-06-25
US	35073290	R10MJVCV3W86UU	0061092827	899591236	Shades of Grace	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Better than "A Woman's Place"	Barbara Delinsky's \\"Shades of Grace\\" is much better than \\"A Woman's Place\\" ----the novel that came after \\"Shades\\" by the same author, Barbara Delinsky.  But, it doesn't quite come close to the page-turning urgency of Delinsky's \\"Three Wishes\\" where you just had to read ahead in that novel (Three Wishes) to find out how things ended up.<br />And so, this is, pretty much, my only complaint with \\"Shades\\" ----as with all Barbara Delinsky novels----again with the exception of \\"Three Wishes\\" and perhaps \\"The Woman Next Door\\"----that there is no suspense, which then also means there will be no page-turning-edge-of-your-seat quality to her books. So, Delinsky novels aren't novels that you absolutely must finish in one sitting--which works perfectly for me.  I like to hold on to a novel for a while and pace myself in my reading.  I felt like I spent some major time checking in with good friends day by day.<br />This novel is about an older woman's descent into Alzheimers disease. And, how her daughter and grandaughter cope with having to be caretakers.  The nice thing, is that author, Delinsky, doesn't get too technical with medical jargon.  She gives you just enough so that you don't feel like you are reading a medical textbook----a frequent complaint I have with other authors who delve too deeply into advanced medical terminology, which is very strenuous on readers who are only looking for general, simple explanations in their fiction.<br />Although, \\"Shades of Grace\\" was writtin in 1995, this novel is very timely since the main character, Grace Dorian, is an advice columnist ala \\"Dear Abby\\" who, in real life, --(Dear Abby) did have Alzheimers.  The daughter then has to take over the mother's advice column, just like in real life with \\"Dear Abby.\\"<br />One thing I must point out is the very racy sex scenes, as the daughter who is overwhelmed with caring for her Alzheimers mother seeks refuge in steamy sex sessions with the mother's doctor!!!  Yes, you heard correctly--- adoctor who sleeps with his patient's daughter.  Delinsky was not exactly setting a very good example or even attempting to deal with the ethical issues regarding this in \\"Shades\\".  Oh well, welcome to the world of fiction, and I suppose their are worse things---although there are a few brief sentences about how the physician has a few ethical concerns.  Not enough to stop the daughter and physician's racy romp which gets very torrid and explicit all throughout this novel.  I've given you fair warning.<br />In the end, I guess I can forgive Delinsky for these gratuitous sex scenes.  After all she did start out as a Harlequin romance writer.  And, her writing is far more intelligent than, say, Fern Michaels or Belva Plain.<br />I am simply hooked on Delinsky's intelligent and thought-provoking writing and characters that become your best friends over time, such that I can forgive any shortcomings.	2003-05-28
US	35073290	RM6WO4Q39HXJT	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Incoherent, jumbled thoughts	This novel starts out with an interesting premise, and it could have been very thought-provoking if the author would have stopped jumping from one half-finished idea to the next.<br />Central character, Susie Salmon, speaking from Heaven, had her life ripped away from her at an early age.  So, I can understand, early in the novel, incomplete ideas being expressed.  But as the novel wears on, Susie is still expressing random thoughts and simply reminiscing about old times before she was murdered.  There is a sense of incompleteness, which I can understand the characters experience, but it is not very nice to force this incompleteness on your readers.<br />Other than the original premise of the murdered teenager remembering and musing on life going on without her, there simply isn't much else going on in this novel.  I know it's the first work from author, Alice Sebold; however, Janet Fitch, in her first novel (White Oleander) had a far better gripping plot, although depressing---&quot;White Oleander&quot;.<br />If you are looking for intelligent, literary quality-female writers....Anita Shreve, and even Susan Vreeland, are much better at expressing complete and direct ideas in a very succinct manner.<br />Everything about this novel is too vague and you are never sure what is real and what isn't.  A little mysticism and afterlife stuff is fine, but too much simply confuses the reader who is hungering for a plot line.<br />I learned my lesson.  Don't read something just because it is popular and a bestseller.	2003-05-25
US	35073290	R39TPUKLDYRKB7	0385335431	533128390	Answered Prayers	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Surprise!!  It's quite good!	I am pleasantly surprised by &quot;Answered Prayers&quot;.  I'm really liking the main characters, Faith and Brad, and their charming romantic banter they engage in.  Keep in mind that I am an old hand at Danielle Steel.  She is the author I read the most (for whatever reason, hers are the books I tend to finish), and so I am very familiar with her writing style, which, admittedly, is extremely repetitive.  I'm comfortable with repetitive writing, though, because I don't tend to finish novels in one sitting/night.  I tend to put down the novels several times and come back to them.  I am also easily distracted, so I, for one, do like the reminders of what has gone on before.<br />Those that aren't familiar and don't happen on to her books that much, may not like this style of writing.<br />Still, I found &quot;Answered Prayers&quot;  main character, Faith Madison, far more likeable, sympathetic, spiritual, and deep.....than wishy-washy Isabelle Forrester from Danielle Steel's &quot;The Kiss&quot;.  The main character in &quot;Answered Prayers&quot; , Faith, is caught in a very controlling and oppressive marriage with her monster of a husband.  Faith tends to be very passive, but as the novel progresses, finds her voice and becomes assertive with the husband, as she becomes closer and closer to her male confidant, Brad, someone she knew from her childhood.<br />I know some readers will lose patience with Faith. But, I find her a gentle soul. There do exist women like her in society--very religious, old-fashioned, and refusing to leave their bad marriage.  So, I think in that respect, Danielle Steel told a very realistic story.  Yes, these plots do get recycled.  Steel's novel &quot;Journey&quot; was also about an abusive marriage.  However, the religious aspect in &quot;Answered Prayers&quot; makes it far better than &quot;Journey&quot;.  <br />&quot;Answered Prayers&quot; is certainly better than the stupid and goofy &quot;The Cottage&quot; by Danielle Steel.<br />&quot;Answered Prayers&quot; just seemed to resonate with me far more than any Danielle Steel novel has in a long time.<br />Come to think of it, I also liked &quot;Sunset in St. Tropez&quot; too.<br />I am looking forward to reading &quot;Dating Game&quot;, as I feel Danielle Steel has made a comeback and returned to, if not great writing, at least interesting characters and glamorous settings in novels that are easy to finish.	2003-05-21
US	35073290	R88OODBPANJQW	0440221315	21466307	The Gift	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Simple Gifts	I'm taking one star off only because this novel wasn't really a page turner.  It wasn't the kind of book you just have to finish in one sitting, the way I'd expect to with one of the shorter Danielle Steel novels such as this one.  It was very easy to put down, and took me quite a bit of time to finish because the story was so predictable that you already knew what was going to happen and were not necessarily compelled to turn pages.<br />Nevertheless, what I did read, when I decided to pick it up, was somewhat poignant and tender in a very simple and childish way.<br />This novel would be good for teens as it deals with high schoolers who are in love and one teenager in particular, who gets herself into unfortunate circumstances, and then meets up with a sympathetic family that is going through it's own trauma.  I can't really go further in describing the plot without giving away the whole story.<br />I think four stars is actually a bit generous.  Still, the heartbreaking nature of the emotions the characters experience, even though Steel has a simplistic way of writing about them, provide enough warm and fuzzies which allow the reader to experience heartfelt emotion right along with the characters.<br />Think Nicholas Sparks &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot;, even though in that novel, the teens experienced totally different issues.  Steel's writing doesn't come close to the thought provoking and efficient nature of Sparks.  But, the emotions and the fact that both novels deal with teens make both &quot;A Walk...&quot; and &quot;The Gift&quot; slightly similar.	2003-04-11
US	35073290	R2AC3X8ASS1A67	0061095052	946823620	A Woman's Place	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Not as good as "Three Wishes"	This novel is about the trials and tribulations of a woman who is being divorced by her ex-husband.<br />Central character Claire Raphael seems pretty passive and simply stands by while her husband takes custody of her kids and takes her to the cleaners because she has her own business and earns more money than the ex-husband.<br />There needed to be more conflict and drama.  Maybe, Claire could have kidnapped the children or taken revenge on her ex, for the sake of plot suspense and momentum.  Instead, poor Claire waits for the legal system to dole out what little she does end up with.<br />Also, Claire has to deal with her aging and dying mother, Connie.  Why do characters in Barbara Delinsky books call their mothers by their first names always?<br />Coming off the surreal and mystical \\"Three Wishes\\" by Barbara Delinsky, \\"A Woman's Place\\" was a let-down, due to the central character's (In \\"Woman's Place\\") inability to take action, no matter what it was, regarding her sad situation.<br />The book just plods along while central character, Claire waits for her situation to change.  This novel comes closest to repetitive Danielle Steel novels, since much of \\"A Woman's Place\\" is taken up by Claire  doing nothing but endlessly and incessantly complaining about her lot in life instead of pro-actively doing something about it.	2003-04-07

This is not the best Steel has written.  For one thing, it's horrendously repetitive.  This is a novel for when you are very distracted and need to be reminded constantly of plot details.  This is a novel for when you are not looking for anything too deep and heavy.<br />The edition I read was a very repetitive 631 pages in large print. Steel obviously did research into the beginnings of aviation and airplanes and anyone who is interested in the history of air, flights, and transportation will enjoy this, provided you keep in mind it is very long and the writing doesn't have much depth.<br />The closest author I can compare this story and Steel's writing to, is Fern Michaels.  If you like author, Fern Michaels's plots and writing style, you will like &quot;Wings&quot; by Danielle Steel.<br />Steel was, apparently writing more lengthy and involved novels back in the mid 1990's.  I just wish the writing wasn't so cliched and repetitive.	2003-03-24

The small-town Vermont setting is far better than any of the other small-town \\"Lake Henry\\" novels Delinsky has done.<br />Anyone who likes Nicholas Sparks or Luanne Rice is sure to like Three Wishes.	2003-01-19

It seemed like all the characters were made into alcoholics for the sake of character conflict.<br />The romance of Caroline Renwick and Joe Connor is complicated by a shooting that involved both their parents years ago.  Caroline and Joe began writing letters when they were teenagers, so there's a lot of backstory told through letters.<br />This novel feels a lot like Nicholas Sparks's &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; what with taking place near the ocean, and lots of old letters remembered.  &quot;Firefly Beach&quot; has lots of stuff about deep-sea diving and oceanography, as the Connor brothers are scuba divers looking for lost ocean treasure--very similar to the diving instructor in &quot;Message in a bottle&quot;.<br />However, Luanne Rice's Connecticut shoreline is nowhere near as compelling as Nicholas Sparks North Carolina shoreline in &quot;Message in a Bottle,&quot; which I might rather read than &quot;Firefly&quot;.<br />Luanne Rice's other novel, &quot;Summer Light&quot;, the one that came after &quot;Firefly&quot;, was the better one of the two Luanne Rice books.	2002-10-25
US	35073290	R1AGCNSZSA7UV9	0060175400	951868170	The Poisonwood Bible	Books	4	4	9	N	N	One-Shot Wonder	This is an excellent and original novel with a unique premise.  Four daughters and their mother travel to Africa with their fanatical preacher father, all from the USA, to do missionary work in the 1950's.  The story is told in the first person through each of the daughters eyes and the mother's.  <br />I learned a lot about the Belgian Congo.  Or, at least Barbara Kingsolver's interpretation of the Belgian Congo political situation.<br />I am taking one star off for the lack of peril and conflict through the last 1/3 of the novel.  The first 2/3 of Poisonwood are action packed as the family encounters lots of unusual situations and find themselves in a variety of jeopardy.  Things get pretty slow towards the end; however, because the reader has already fallen in love with the interesting characters, you do want to read on, even through the slow finish, to find out how they all make out. Because the characters are so humorous, individually unique with voices all their own----great characterization can overcome plot defects later on.<br />Unfortunately, Kingsolver has never come close to the success and acclaim of Poisonwood in her other novels.  Both Pigs in Heaven and Prodigal Summer are horrible.  Poisonwood is the only Kingsolver novel of hers I would recommend reading.	2002-10-02

I mean constant suffering with no let-up.  Well, naturally, it IS after all an Oprah book. God forbid Oprah should choose anything fun, or romantic comedy for her bookclub.<br />Why must main character, foster child, Astrid's life, going through one foster home to the next, be frought with tragedy upon tragedy with absolutely no fun or happy moments. I know plenty of foster parents who are doing a good job and have good living situations with their foster children. <br />In any novel you want balance.  A writer should balance the happy times with the sad, at the very least, for the sake of variety.  Too much unrelenting tragedy desensitizes the reader and you begin to become indifferent to all the suffering heaped upon constant suffering.<br />On the plus side, White Oleander is page-turning, and can't-put-down-able.  But, I really think author Janet Fitch should use her poetic and lyrical writing skills to write something, next time, that's lighter and not as frought with unrelenting tragedy with no let-up in sight.	2002-10-02

No wonder Oprah had to cancel her reading group after endorsing this...!<br />Confession:  I didn't get past the first 134 pages in Large Print.  I knew what was coming though.  Thing is, even if I disagree with the subject matter, I will still keep reading for great writing.  You don't even have that much, here.<br />The writing is such a jumble of styles, foreign languages, mixed 1st and 3rd person, weird humor, religious parody etc....

I don't mind suffering characters and tragedy if the writing's good.<br />This is the last Oprah's book I will even attempt.

This is a better way to learn about a foreign land and its people than, say, reading a guidebook.<br />But for the lack of any action, Rosamunde Pilcher's writing is highly literate and very reader-friendly.  She has a very detailed way of describing the scenery and atmosphere which strangely does not bore.<br />If you enjoy modern English authors like Ian McEwan (Atonement) and like a British-sort of  banter without suspense, peril, or action, then you'd like this.<br />Although there was nothing much going on plot-wise, and none of the characters were ever in any jeopardy or peril....I still loved Pilcher's intimate descriptions of the daily minutae of Scottish life.<br />This is my first Rosamunde Pilcher.

If you have never read Rice before, or tried to read her before,(say, Cloud Nine-Dream Country) but couldn't, &quot;Summer Light&quot; is a very fast paced novel and better than her previous works. I had to force myself to put it down.  I don't always like to finish a novel in one sitting, but I could have with this.<br />There were several times when I was near tears, which doesn't always happen when I read romances.<br />The themes of forgiveness, miracles, and lots of medical terminology running through this novel, as one of the main characters, Hockey player, Martin Cartier, is going blind--very sad and tragic, as he tries to wield a hockey puck but can't see. Martin Cartier needs a miracle, and he just might have found it in his love interest, May Taylor, and her &quot;psychic&quot; daughter, 6-year-old, Kylie.<br />Luanne Rice is a very emotional writer, more emotional than intellectual.  The writing isn't as thought-provoking as it is emotion-feeling provoking.  But this is what most romance readers want: writing that makes you feel, rather than think.  Although, out of all the romance writers, Luanne Rice (along with Barbara Delinsky and Nicholas Sparks) is the most intelligent and realistic.<br />If you liked Barbara Delinskys &quot;Lake News&quot; or Nicholas Sparks &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; then you would like &quot;Summer Light&quot;.<br />So, on to Luanne Rice's &quot;Firefly Beach&quot;, as I am looking forward to reading a lot more by this author.	2002-09-06
