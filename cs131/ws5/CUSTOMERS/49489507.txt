If you are a cat lover, you will especially like this book because there lots of cats in the story. Ms.Coulter adds lots of mystery to the story so reading Pendragon is almost like reading a romantic suspense. She didn't forget to add tons of laughters. The sensuality is quite sizzling. You will feel quite lost if you read Pendragon without reading previous titles in the series although the author tried to provide info about the characters. I recommend that you read the previous titles in the series first. Read this book and you will inevitably become a fan of Catherine Coulter.	2002-03-22
US	49489507	R26GK1TPX2NQDI	0451198964	311275971	The Moon Lord: Lords of Midnight	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A touching love story.	I really loved 'The moon lord'. All the characters are lovable. The story is set in Medieval. The devastatingly handsome Trancred de Vierzon is known as The moon lord. He is awarded by king Richard the right to take Wynnsef. When he arrives at the estate, Rosamund of Wynnsef tries to resist him because she is bound to be loyal to her brother. She feels guilty that she falls in love with her enemy. This book is a beautifully written tear jerker. (ok, there is a happy ending to it). At first one might think that this book would end in such a heartbreaking way but there is a lighthearted surprise to happily end the story. Ms.Wilhelm depicts what is in their hearts and their feelings so wonderfully that I got swept away with them.  Secondary characters also add colors to the story. There is a secondary romance between the two main secondary characters and this helps ease the tension of the story.  This book will make you laugh and cry and the characters will have their parts in your heart for a long time.	2002-02-27

The story is very compelling and emotional. Christian Langland, Duke of Jervaulx, suffers a stroke and everyone considers that he is mad. He was sent to an asylum where Maddy tends to him and helps him get out of it and nurses him back to health again. Maddy is a very practicing Quaker. As she falls in love with Jervaulx, she struggles to fight between her commitment to her way and her true feeling toward Jervaulx. The story made me love and cry, it depicts a true love that bonds two people so tightly that nothing can do them apart. Ms.Kinsale adds lighthearted humors to reduce the intensity of the story by Jervaulx's two dogs - Devil and Cass.  This is kind of story that will have a part in your heart forever.	2002-02-19

This my first Jill Marie Landis book I read and it is not my last. Blue Moon is a fabulous read. This is a very beautiful love story of two emotionally tortured people who at first believe that they are not worth of love but gradually feel the true love from one another as they fall in love. The hero, Noah LeCroix, one-eye, scarred half-breed is the hero of my favorite type - physically and emotionally scarred. Noah belives that he is not worth of being love because of his scars.  The heroine, Olivia Bond, believes that she is worthless because of her being exclusive whore of Darcy Lankanal, a whorehouse owner in New Orleans. She is a real heroine who can forgive every unforgivable crime others did to her in the past. You will savor the romantic love story between the two while get excited by thrilling intrigues as dangers approach them. <BR>If scarred-hero theme is your favorite, this book is for you. I highly recommend it.	2002-02-02

The storyline is beautifully woven. Ms.Lindsey well mixes thriller with romance.  I also love all of Milisant's pets. One of them even helps Wulfric to find her when she is abducted. Milisant's twin sister, Jhon, is also very lovable. I wish there were a book of her own story. All in all, this is a light read and I highly recommend it.	2002-01-27

The storyline is made of a wonderful mixture of suspense mystery and romance. Although this book features the famous &quot;dislike at first sight&quot; theme but Ms.Kleypas made it different. The hero and the heroine don't seem to like each other when they first met because of Lily's extraordinary characteristics. As the story goes, they falls in love with each other. I like the way that Lord Alex accepts Lily just the way she is. He loves her despite the fact that she has a cloud of dark secret (about her stolen baby) surrounding her. The characters are so likeable that I can't wait to read the sequel -- &quot;Dreaming of you&quot; which has Derek Craven as the hero. Bravo Ms.Kleypas	2002-01-19

I picked it up because of I just grew fond of the cover and it didn't betray me as I got hooked on at the very first pages. I love Scottish romance and I love tortured/imperfect heroes so this book is perfect for my taste because it's all about a shattered Scottish warrior. The hero, Malcolm MacFane, seems so real.  He has weaknesses of a real human and I like that. The heroine, Ariella MacKendrick, is a real fighter who never falters. The secondary characters are also lovely and they pleasantly add life to the story. This book is very well written. Ms. Monk is blessed with storytelling gift. She also has a wonderful sense of humor and cleverly added a good portion of it to the story.  All in all, this is a beautiful love story with unforgettable characters that will linger in your heart for a long time.	2002-01-08

This is my first Susan Johnson book and it is probably not my last.<BR>I hesitated to buy this book at first because of low ratings but I decided to give it a try. Basically this book is like a soap. The hero, Lord Bathurst is emotionally tortured by the death of his wife and child. Isabella Leslie is a beauty and an heiress. It's not plausible for her to run away from a disgusting marriage bed and end up in a brothel. One thing I can't accept is that the Season welcomes her despite her staying at brothel and being Dermott's &quot;temporary whore&quot;. The story is quite lengthy. It takes about 300 pages for Dermott to stop delving into the past grief and realize how much he loves Isabella. There are several burning sex scenes between Dermott and Isabella and some of them are a bit kinky. Despite many criticisms, I still found this book an entertaining read. (At least it did keep me turning the pages). The author also added informative historical notes at the back of the book. (This means she did research extensively on historical facts before writing the book).	2002-01-04
US	49489507	R1ERB081LGYALO	0440222591	723801793	Pale Moon Rider	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Wonderful highwayman-theme historical romance	I have been a strong fan of Marsha Canham. I loved this book. At first I thought that Captain Starlight was an ordinary 'Robin Hood' but he is not that type of highwayman. This Tyrone Hart is not ordinary. He is literate and he can play the piano very well. The love between Tyrone and Renee paces very quickly. Their adventures are breathtakingly thrilling. The intrigues are well created. The sensuality is sizzling. There are quite descriptive sex scenes. One and only flaw of this book is an unaccuracy in historical fact that Chopin wasn't born until 1810 and the setting of this story is 1796. I didn't know why this occurred to the author who is otherwise very accurate when it comes to historical facts. I hope she will fix it if there is to be a reissue. After all Marsha Canham never disappoints me. I would highly recommend this book.	2001-12-04

This book is a very entertaining and captivating read. I just couldn't put it down. I spent one night to finish it. Lord Gabriel is a wickedly handsome earl who is always in bad mood. All of what he does including marrying Cassie seem to be aimed at irritating his father. Cassie is used as a pawn against his father's will to marry him to another woman. The relationship between Gabriel and Cassie is tensed. Cassie always thinks that she is his unwanted, unloved wife. Gabriel's pride runs so high in his blood that he always says everything that should have never been said to hurt her. As the story progresses, Gabriel comes to realize that his true feeling for her and how much she means to him. The secondary characters are lovable especially Lady Evelyn and Christopher.  Ms.James is a talented storyteller. She weaved such an exciting intrigues into a sizzling historical romance.	2001-11-05

I must admit that at first I didn't want to read this book because of low ratings other readers had given and besides low ratings-----I didn't seem to accept a scarred hero) I gave it a try though and I found that I was a fool to dislike disfigured heros) This book is much better than I thought. The hero is Cleve of Malverne from 'Lord of Raven Peak' (2nd book in trilogy) he is now friend of Lord Merrik and a Viking warrior. The heroine is Princess Chessa (she is Eze, daughter of the wizard Hormuze from 'Lord of Hawkfell Island') Cleve has a scar on a side of his face but it does not reduce the beauty of his face in Chessa's eyes. Their adventure is exciting. The secondary characters do their job well. I highly recommend all the books in Viking Trilogy. They are all entertaining read.	2001-10-25

It inspires me to purchase a diary book and began to write it daily. I like the book the way that it features an ordinary woman who is not a novel-like perfect. She expresses her thoughts and feelings in the diary. The author has sense  of humor too. I like the way Bridget counts units of alcohol consumption, calories and how many times she dials 1471. I read this book in both English and Thai versions. I highly recommend this book to everyone especially those who love to write diary. I bet you will read it more than one time.	2001-10-17

Merrik and Laren are ideal couple. Merrik is not like other heroes that are woman abusers. Merrik never poorly treats Laren he always keeps Laren safe even from his own brother, Erik. At first I felt that the relationship between Merrik and Laren's little brother Taby was disturbing but later Merrik shows that he loves Laren so much and he feels that Taby is his little brother.  He proves that he loves Laren not because she is only Taby's sister.  Their adventure is exciting. There are many intriques and twists. The tamest character could become the most dangerous murderer.<BR>Catherine Coulter never disappoints me. Although this is not her best book but it's worth a try. Her wonderful sense of humor never let you read without laugting. You will enjoy this one as much as I did.	2001-10-09

The story was very well created. The book is full of thrilling intrigues and twists and turns. It's simply a very entertaining and perhaps the most sexiest read and I just couldn't put it down. The heroine, Annaleah Flairchilde, falls in love with the hero, Emory Althorpe, very quickly because he is so charming and beautiful.  Emory is washed away unconscious on the shore and is found by Anna. He awakes with no memory and he is accused of being a traitor and treason. Anna is a strong-willed and brave woman once she believes he is innocent, she is determined to go with him to find out the truth before it is too late. There are enemies to fight with and secrets and plots lie in wait for they to resolve. As they go together, Emory also cares for Anna. He even risks his life to keep his promise to get rose oil for her. Beware of Lord Barrimore, he almost makes me believe that he is truly a hero. Swept Away is the very best book with unforgettable characters that will live in your hearts forever. You must not miss this one if you are a fan of Regency.	2001-10-03

This book is a very entertaining read and a hilarious page turner. The author is full of sense of humor and a wonderful storyteller. The hero is but a cat! He is no ordinary cat though. At the beginning I almost couldn't accept his cat being but as I read on I found that the book is a great timeswept romance. The hero, Rejar or Prince Nikolai Azov is very sexy. He travels from another world to Regency England and meets Lilac Devere. She detests him at first but she changes because of his passionate and caring self. Rejar seems to be more humanlike in later chapters. The plots are not complex  yet there are embedded with excitements. I also like all of the secondary characters especially Rejar's brother, Traed.  I highly recommend this book to all of romance fans.	2001-09-11

It's not as bad as others may think. Just like many novels, the hero (Lord Rolik) despises the heroine (Mirana) at the beginning but he unknowingly changes as the story goes. I was surprised by twists and turns til the very last pages. The secondary characters especially Entti add a lot of colors to the story. There are so many laughters. I like when Hormuze decides to dye Sira's silver-blonde hair with black color. A novel is a novel so don't think too much about reasonability and reality just enjoy it. Catherine Coulter will never disappoint you.	2001-08-26

The sizzling sentuality will make you hardly take a breath. Ms.Canham does an excellent job in weaving the historical facts and people with imaginary love story. I just felt as if I were there to witness the events. I kept turning the pages to find out about Angus's honor, his pledge to fight for the English and the reason of his acting as a traitor. There are characters from the prequels so if you don't want to get mixed up, I recommend that you read its prequels - Prides of Lion and Blood of Roses first. After all, I recommend Midnight Honor to those of you who are strong fans of Scottish historical romances.	2001-08-11

Note: If you happen to dislike the disgusting scene in the first few pages, please skip it and move on to the next page.

This is one of the masterpieces of historical novel but if you don't like tragedy do not read it. I rated it 4 stars for the effort of the Mr. Frazier to lyrically wrote it.

If you are sort of people who can't bear unhappy endings please don't purchase this book. I tell you true, the ending spoils everything beautiful in previous chapters. But if you are seeking a book with rich descriptive and expressive writing this book will do it.	2001-03-13
