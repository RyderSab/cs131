What's a gal to do? She contacts her ex-lover/professor a self-proclaimed Poe specialist and joins forces with him to ferret out this serial killer and bring him to justice.<br /><br />As the murders get more gruesome, Hewitt gets more desperate in her quest and takes on risks she knows she shouldn't. Will her final quest for the deranged man who kills by the book be an act of heroism, or her final act of vengence?<br /><br />Sheldon Rusch does a good job with the Poe references in weaving them through the story. He builds tension and creates believable suspense. Rusch brings the story to a satisfying conclusion with the appropriate amount of twisted, gruesome insight that pulls the reader along. Hewitt is a character I'd watch out for.	2005-09-05

Wow. Keeping track of them took all my concentration.<br /><br />A murderer is killing redheads and wouldn't you know, Reve and Jazzy are redheads and just learning from DNA testing that they're sisters separated at birth.<br /><br />Barton does a great job of carrying on several sub-plots, both romantical and subverse along with the main plot story. She pulls all the strings together in the end and ties them all up in a nice little knot. For me, I'd like to have known a bit more detail about how the story lines ended, but then maybe what I'm really missing is the beginning of the story. I think I'll give Barton's other books a try and start this series over from the beginning.	2005-01-22

Because Cornwell finally showed some vulnerability in her characters. They're not larger than life. They do have feelings and they do have problems. It was getting a bit tiresome reading about \\"Super Kay\\" and her Superfriends.<br /><br />Sure, Blow Fly isn't a typical Scarpetta novel. The new writing style didn't take much time to get used to, but it did help in revealing character development.<br /><br />The Chandonne family are becoming a bit of a thorn in Scarpetta's side and I was really hoping Cornwell would wrap up the history in this book. It was my only disappointment.<br /><br />Bringing back Benton really through a wrench in the works and I'm very interested in how this new storyline develops. Will Benton be able to forget the past and live a \\"normal\\" life?

Cornwell didn't leave me hanging -- changes and more changes for my favorite heroine, Kay Scarpetta.<br />Cornwell twisted this tough medical examiner inside out, upside down, and all around until she resembled a discarded latex glove. With THE LAST PRECINCT, we see all sides of Scarpetta, including a deeper look into what makes her tick and what ticks her off.<br />With the world against her, her job on the line, being framed for a vicious murder, and old memories getting in the way,  Scarpetta must finally do what she's never been able to do before, lean on others and let them help her. Unfortunately, even those who only have good intentions for Scarpetta, end up hurting her -- friends, family, and even her co-workers all discover a newer, more vulnerable Kay.<br />I'm excited about this new direction for Kay Scarpetta and you will be too, when you read THE LAST PRECINCT.	2002-06-07

Piers Anthony is back with a great plot as well as a bucketful puns. I know, people have been saying that the Xanth books were becoming just one big pun and there wasn't really a story. I'll have to agree, but it was only a few books and they were still a GREAT read. But, be forewarned. The Dastard has not one, not two, but more plots and subplots than you'd ever dream of in Xanth book.

Although in Patricia's case, the nest had existed of only herself and her daughter; the husband and father had exited himself from their lives long ago. Patricia was ready for something new, to move on with her life, to have a life of her own after so many years of devoted attention to her daughter. Not that she regretted giving her life over to raising her daughter - but wasn't this the perfect time to begin a life of her own? Patricia turned to the computer that her daughter had purchased for her and the world of virtual reality to begin the journey of her new life.<br />James Campbell was searching for something; something that perhaps existed only in his mind - not something that was attainable in the real world. His self esteem was at its lowest; his wife had left him - and not for another man either. His wife had left him for another woman. James turned to the computer and the Message Boards of the cyber world to begin his pursuit of the `unattainable' and to build up his low self esteem.<br />Patricia and James meet in cyberspace at the \\"Anyone 40ish\\" Message Board. This is their story as told in their messages to each other. Come read along as their relationship escalates and grows - into love.<br />Forever Until We Meet is a must read.

But, I think, deep down, this book takes a step away from typical Grisham by giving the readers a look at a part of life most ignore -- the homeless.<br />Read for the Grisham factor, but enjoy for the life lesson.	2001-10-14

Jim Vega has written a believable and riveting tale set between ships in deep space and Earth in the year 2127.<br />At first glance, Jim Vega can be compared to Robert Heinlein or even Greg Bear. Each author uses detailed descriptions of intricate scientific functions combined with in depth character development.<br />From there, Jim Vega goes beyond to develop his own style. Vega handles the various settings of space and time flawlessly. He gives the reader subtle directions, signposts, if you will, that keep the reader oriented on current events without appearing too obvious.<br />Vega understands his characters and lets them behave normally. Isolated from the rest of the world, his shipboard community faces almost insurmountable catastrophes with the right amount of courage and dejection; no feelings are forced, no reactions are implausible.<br />Of course, having a degree in oceanography, twenty years experience in the aerospace, defense, and environmental protection industries, and a penchant for eastern philosophies doesn't hurt Mr. Vega's ability to write a science fiction story with a firm base of reality.<br />Ceti Mission is the first in a series of books titled Tau Ceti Series. You can bet this reader is going to add it to her collection.	2001-10-11

They caught my eye and made me stop more than once to read the rest of the section before going back to where I started. I had to force myself to stop reading the quotations and go back to the beginning. Bravo, Mr. Bremer, for making me anticipate each section and the great quotations I knew it would contain.<br />This isn't your typical \\"how to write user documentation\\" book. If you're looking for dry, technically-scientific terms and long winded sentences, don't read this book.<br />Warning: This book isn't for everyone who wants to be a technical writer or a better technical writer. If you are looking for a lesson in grammar, don't read this book. If you are expecting to learn how to type or use a word processor, forget reading this book. However, if you are looking for a new, innovative way to write clear, concise instructions for the layman consumer audience, then make yourself comfortable and read away. This is your book.<br />Caution: This book may cause you to see technical documentation in a new light. You may become overly excited and expect your company to immediately adopt your new ideals and change their documentation or product lifecycle processes.<br />It's very obvious, right from the beginning that Mr. Bremer knows what he's talking about and can express himself very well. He has a firm grasp on who the reader is and how to sort through the garbage and find that reader the gems. He describes the different readers and how to best reach each one.<br />Best of all, he doesn't cop a \\"holier-than-thou\\" attitude. Even though we can tell he's \\"been there, done that, and bought the t-shirt,\\" he keeps his opinions low key. I, for one, am grateful. I refuse to take any technical author seriously who tells me that their way is the ONLY way. Mr. Bremer makes it very clear that what he's writing about are ideals and suggestions that have worked for him in one form or another and may not work for everyone.<br />Mr. Bremer's basic philosophy is to keep everything simple. \\"Simple in language. Simple in style. Simple in organization. Keep Occam's Razor handy, and use it often.\\" For those who don't know, Occam's Razor is the rule that if there are two ways to do something, the simpler one is the better one. That rule has always been a personal favorite of mine and I am glad to see it used here.for him in one form or another and may not work for everyone. <br />Mr. Bremer's basic philosophy is to keep everything simple. \\"Simple in language.
