The same concept of two people with a telepathic connection linked with sexual tendencies has been done before, and frankly a lot better. Probably the best book I've read with that topic was MIMOSA GROVE, by Dinah McCall. Maybe if I had read this one before that, I would have thought differently about it. It was not a bad read, but there really was little to the story line and no great twists or surprise ending. Not even a reveal of any kind. It just kind of died off and was fairly non-climactic. I hate to say something so negative about this book when it was okay, but it just didn't do it for me. Is it worth the money to buy? Possibly. If you are into the sci-fi paranormal, sord of X-files story and like a lot of heated sex to your romance, than you will probably enjoy this book. As far as the plot goes, read it with an open mind and don't expect too much. That way, you won't be dissappointed. If you can find this book for under five bucks, you should be fine with it.	2005-10-09
US	18323018	R34F8V33VRPPXT	0446614483	650856322	Nothing To Fear	Books	3	10	14	N	Y	I have to say I was disappointed	I love Karen Rose's books, but I have to say that this one fell short of her usual non-stop suspense filled with good romance. It's not that it was a bad book, but just boring. Other reviewers have mentioned the plot, so I will just state my opinion. <br /> <br />\\"Nothing to Fear\\" was slow getting started, with little romance and nearly no suspense until the very end. It was repetitious and drawn out.It was very difficult to have any interest or reaction to the plot when the entire story focused more around the villian, than the main characters. They just got involved in the story line.  <br /> <br />Don't expect her usual style of writing. This book is typical of other writers and not like the clever writing Karen Rose showed in her other works such as \\"I'm watching you\\". The villian is clearly stated at the very beginning and there is only one surprise twist in the plot but revealed way too early to keep the story line moving.  <br /> <br />This book could easily have been condensed down to a good 350 pages and held the reader on the edge of their seat. For me, it barely held my attention and I was really looking forward to reading this book. Not worth the price in my opinion.	2005-09-19

US	18323018	R188PGC9KQMEED	0061012963	589801516	Bad Karma	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Really more of a 3 and 1/3 stars	This was a really quick, light hearted read. It does not start out with much on the lines of suspense, but about midway through the story shifts into a paranormal encounter involving death and kidnapping. Although there are no real red herrings, no clever twists, no surprise ending there was still something about this story that kept me turning the pages. <br />The relationship between the two characters is a bit strange. The author failed to emphasize why Cleo and Daniel are attracted to one another. The romance just kind of happens and until closer to the end, there are no real feelings for one another other than the sex. However, by the end of the book I was definitely feeling better connected to them.  <br />Make sure that if you decide to read this book, you approach it with the thought of it being not much more than just a contemporary romance. Then when the suspense actually kicks in, you will be more interested.  <br />This is only my second Theresa Weir novel, and I have noticed that her plots are only mediocre in the interest factor. If not for good characters, readers would never pick up another book. I think that her portrayal of Beau, the mentally challenged brother was done well, but I would have liked to have him more involved in the plot rather than just a person in the background. <br />Is it worth buying? For the used price, definitely. However, you must remember that you will also need to pay postage. Knowing that, you may want to check it out from the library.	2005-09-09

I didn't feel it was near as steamy as everyone else claims, and even a little light for a romance. I had difficulty with the character's relationship throughout most of the book unsure if Nick really is guilty of murder and how a doctor of Psychology could risk her safety for a man who harbors so much violence within him. I guess that's what makes this story pull the reader in both directions. The story line was fairly predictable and the author had a couple opportunities to really twist the plot but failed to do so. Not even the ending is much of a shocker. Therefore, I really could not give it more than four stars and even that may be stretching this one in comparison to other books that measure up far better. Is it worth buying? At the price of the used books, sure. If you were to actually find a new one at a higher price, than I'm not quite sure, but for $2.50, why not.	2005-09-07

All the words were there and the character's heartaches, but I just didn't feel the emotion. The story line itself also did not have much of a plot to it. It seemed to repeat itself. There is a fire, Griffen comes to help put it out. They think they have it contained, so he goes home. Then it flares up again and he goes back, once again containing it. He goes home again, and when he returns once more there is another flare up. It's like the author couldn't find anything else to write about. The entire story along with the relationships could have easily been wrapped up in a quick short story without dragging it out. <br />The other reviews were so good that I was expecting more from this author. I just don't know why I didn't feel the same way about this book as they all did. Then again, I am only one opinion. All I can say is if you pay for this book and then share my same sentiments about it, you will be very disappointed.	2005-09-06

I couldn't put the book down until I had read the last page. Even then, I wanted more. It was the type of contemporary romance that you might see made into a movie aired on lifetime or maybe with a little more humor the big screen. It was touching and enjoyable to read. It is exactly the type of book you would want to read if you need to escape reality for a while and just get absorbed in romance.	2005-09-04

Each author clearly had their own vision of how this story should develop, but they did not all have the same vision making this novel very confusing. There are way too many characters and it seems that even up to the end new ones were being added. There were no main characters that had you engaged in their lives. It was just a mess. Chapters 11 and 12 were well developed and flowed together nicely as if those two authors understood each other. As for the last chapter, well it had a different twist to the plot in almost every chapter. It was literally over done. Never along the entire book were the characters introduced as suspects. It was all just a bunch of victims with no real villains so the authors seemed to feel the need to create more characters and then try and tie the story up with a weak ending. <br />This book is not even worth checking out from the library. It is just painful to read. I hate to say that when there are so many good authors collaborating in this novel, but perhaps there were too many and not enough unity. Don't waste your money on this one.	2005-09-03

It was a quick read, but did not compare to the military writings of Suzanne Brockmann. Maybe that's because the air force men were not as hot and interesting as SEALs are. <br />This book was not bad, but it did have a few flaws. It starts out rather slow and uninteresting in the beginning. The suspense does pick up a little, but it is the character's attraction that keeps the story moving along. The ending seemed too rushed and did not rap up as well as it could have. The villains were never a mystery, there were no twists and turns and no surprise ending. You pretty much know everything within the first few chapters, including everyone involved. Even though I breezed through reading it in about eight hours, I just didn't find it that suspenseful. Save yourself some money and check this one out from the library.	2005-09-02

Although it did seem obvious that there was more to the story than the author touched base on.  <br />I had several problems with this book. First off, way too many characters were introduced at the start. Maybe if I would have read the other books first, I would have known who they were, but as BB started jumping around at the beginning to touch base on each family and how miserable their lives were, I found it very boring. I found it a bit much to read how almost every man in the county cheated on their wives and slept with prostitutes. Even some of the unmarried ones did. There is something really wrong with that. Sure it was supposed to create more red herrings, but it was just annoying.  <br />Secondly, the romance part of it was lame. The two bicker and fight until near page 250 and then all of a sudden they are hot and heavy. Too much of the story focused on all the sordid details of everyone else's sex life and affairs than on Reve and Jacob. I would not call this a romantic suspense in even loose terms. Yes there was sex, but way too late in the story to create the same type of anticipation the reader looks forward to.  <br />Lastly, either this author does not know the definition of certain words or there are a few typos that are really bad. For example, one of the funniest ones talks about how Jacob's BACK hair fell across the pillow. Okay, that is just gross if he really had so much hair it piled over the pillow. I realize the author meant to say BLACK hair, but now you see what I mean by typos. Other ones are even worse where the words used have entirely different meanings and make the reader wonder if that is what BB meant to say or what it should have read. <br />Other than that, the reveal of the killer is dragged out until the very end but it is pretty obvious who it is. As my first Beverly Barton book, I was not impressed in the least. Linda Howard wrote that the book was fastpaced, multi-faceted and absolutely riveting. Multi-faceted, yes. Anything other than that no. Kay Hooper wrote \\"a powerful story that kept me up very late-with all the lights on. With a villain you won't soon forget and nail biting suspense.\\" If this was nail biting and too scary to keep the lights on, she must be reading children's stories because there was nothing about this book that was anywhere near to that description. Sorry to lay it all out, but this one is not worth the buy.	2005-09-01

A vigilante group of women all suffering from abused crimes form ZOE. They want revenge against those men who have caused them or their loved ones harm. The way the system works is that one name is pulled out each time and the mercenary is paid to take out that person. However, these are not men who have been found guilty and the revenge these women seek may just execute the wrong suspect. The police know the group is involved and the victim's sister wants nothing to do with Zoe's actions. <br />The killer is revealed too soon and the romance is weak. Frankly, it is not much more than an okay book checked out from the library. Not worth the money to buy only to forget the characters and their story soon after.	2005-08-30

The romance doesn't start until midway through and there is no flirting or lead in to the sex. The suspense picks up about 2/3 into the book and has you held in anticipation, but many of the red herrings get cleared too early and then it is obvious, at least it was for me who was left as the bad guy. <br />This would not be a book to read if you have to go visit someone at the hospital unless you enjoy the feeling of someone following you in the parking garage, and that shot of fear that goes with it. <br />Even though I do not think this is one of Heather Graham's best books, it was  a quick read and did have some good suspense that held to the end. Despite my ability to solve the mystery part of it, the average reader who rarely does, will probably think the ending is shocking. <br />This really is more of a 3 and 1/2 stars, but since that wasn't an option I went for the 4 over lowering the score. It isn't a bad read, just not one of the best.	2005-08-27

I was actually looking for an Elizabeth Lowell book when this one caught my eye. I am very pleased that I picked it up. The short chapters make for quick easy reading even though the book is 452 pages long, it does not seem like it. The suspense holds strong throughout the book with spurts of more intense suspense.  <br />The characters are likable and although the story line has been done before, it was still a very enjoyable read. I can not remember being bored or skipping over huge sections of text any time during this book. The author stuck with the facts and was not overly repetitious. It was a little shy on details. In fact other than the location written at the top of each chapter I don't remember reading much description about where the story took place. <br />I usually don't give a book five stars unless the author either stumps me or finds a way to really pull me in to the story. For me to rate this book so highly is a little off my normal rating scale because it did not have the normal murder mystery clues, red herrings and shocking reveal that a serial killer novel would have, but the writing is so well done that I found it enjoyable. I recommend this book, and look forward to reading others by this author.	2005-08-25
US	18323018	R1LEDUZLDSHQJR	0671524097	527293314	Sharp Edges	Books	4	0	2	N	N	mildly entertaining	My only real complaint with this story was that only a few characters had normal names. An officer with the first name Peaceful, his wife the doctor named meditation, and other bizarre names that are even strange for a soap opera. Even in the art world these names are out there and they came from the townspeople not the artists. It made for annoying reading whenever those names were mentioned, as if the author was poking fun at them or the reader.  <br />Other than that, the story line was simple and easy to follow. I felt the author changing her style of writing during it and experimenting a little with her abilities to try and make the read more suspenseful. It worked out fine, but JAK should have either used it throughout the book, or not at all. It was near the end and frankly, most of the suspense was already over. It seemed like a weak attempt to make something out of nothing. <br />The characters were likable, but I never really felt the pull or attraction between Eugenia and Cyrus. Clearly they had the sex, but why the relationship grows into more is a little on the weak side. This author definitely has the ability to keep the story moving, and with a little more fine tuning and emotion, she could turn out some good works. Sadly, this book is only a mediocre read and nothing to rant and rave about to your friends.	2005-08-23

I had heard that this book was by far the most fantastic book ever written. Whatever that person had read previously must have been really bad, because this was a fairly boring book. It had some action in it, but nothing that kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to find out what happens. I kept wondering when the good stuff starts. Instead, I found myself plodding along painfully reading page after page.  <br />The characters had no substance to them. It was a predictable plot, and the ending was dull. I'm not usually this critical of an author and have enjoyed other Tami Hoag books, but I struggled to even give it three stars. Even as a library loaner, KILL THE MESSENGER is not worth the read in my opinion. However that is my opinion. Read the first few chapters for yourself before buying. Sorry, but the first chapter is completely pointless and has absolutely no relevance to the story. Nothing even happens until chapter four. If you can get into the book before then, you will probably love it. I however, did not.	2005-08-19

There is no climactic reveal, no mystery to figure out, no emotional breakthrough or touching story. It just is what it is. I know that seems vague and cruel, but it was missing friction between the main characters and the pull that has the reader routing for them.  <br />This was my first Lucy Monroe book, and I haven't quite debated whether I will read anymore or not.

Not much of a surprising reveal, but a great deal of suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat and have your heart pounding with anticipation. <br />The only reason I did not give this a full five stars was because the romance part of it was lacking. It definitely did not have the intensity like \\"PURE DYNAMITE\\" did, but was still okay. I do hope that the next book follows up on the missing brother story line. To leave us hanging and not finish it would be a shame. This book is definitely worth the price.	2005-08-14

The romantic dialog seems forced and very fake. The suspense, the story line and every other aspect of the book is wonderfully written, but she has not quite mastered how to create sexual tension with her main characters to where it builds into something more. I also think they need to show more feeling to why they might be falling in love. It just seems unrealistic.

Do not read this book unless you have read Forget me Not. That is very important, because if you do, you will not be surprised by the ending when you decide to go back and read it. That is my only problem with this book like many other authors that have continuing story lines. They tell you everything that happened in the other book and there is nothing to look forward to. My biggest problem with this book, was that I couldn't remember what exactly happened in the first one until I read Harriet Klaussner's review and then it hit me. This book is best read right after the other. <br />As for the story line and characters themselves, it was wonderfully written. Marliss Melton definitely knows her facts concerning navy seals including the dialog. She presents it in a clear and precise way that informs the reader without being boring or overly done. It is a superbly written romantic suspense. I look forward to reading more by this author.	2005-08-14

It was suspenseful and surprising. However, the beginning is slow. I noticed this before from this author that she is very descriptive, almost too much. I found myself skipping over huge chunks of needless information. For instance, there is no reason to describe each building of a town, who owns it or works there and what relevance they had to the character as that person drives down the road unless those people matter, but they don't. Dialog is interupted with meanless descriptions of what the character is doing second by second, like mixing the coffee, and each sip they take. It just gets so boring and breaks up too much of the suspense and plot. <br />On the other hand, the story is fairly basic, but does build at the end to a nice reveal. Not much of a romantic suspense, but this author is fairly new, so perhaps there is hope. She has a great deal of potential, if she would just condense her descriptions down a little.  <br />I wish I could have given it more stars, but except for the last third of the book, it just did nothing for me. I forced myself to keep reading, because I am familiar with this author's works and I did have high hopes. I think I will give her a few years to fine tune her writing and try back again. In my opinion though, I have now bought two of her books based on viewer reviews and am disappointed that I spent the money.	2005-08-14

I don't want to give away too much of the plot, it is better when you know very little about what is going to happen and just enjoy the book for what it is.  <br />My only qualms with the novel was the repetition of reiterating the facts more than once as if the reader couldn't keep track of what was just said, and the relationship moved too quickly with no friction to add to the anticipation. However, it is a compelling read that instantly pulls you into the story leaving you with a completely different outlook than when you began the book. I know this sounds criptic, but I just don't want to spoil it for anyone. Read it and you'll understand what I mean.	2005-07-31

It is overly repetitious. The facts don't match with the suspect, so it's no wonder people can't figure out who the killer is. I liked the jumping back and forth between characters and what is going on only to add more suspense to the story line, but flashbacks into the past were sloppy and confusing at times.  <br />Other than those minor flaws, the book had the potential to be a good romantic suspense. With two sets of romances blooming, the characters are the only thing that holds this book together.  <br />The reveal is too soon in the book and anti-climactic as well as the ending. It was a disappointment to say the least and if you are really curious about this book, than go to the library rather than buying it, because it is not worth the money. It is okay for a quick read, as long as you do not expect much, you will not be disappointed and may even enjoy it.  <br />It really is more of three and a half stars, but that wasn't an option. It is sad, because this book had so much potential. When reading it, you become engrossed in it, but by the time you reach the end, it fails miserably. I think Hidden Secrets was a much better book by this author. I haven't given up hope on her though.	2005-07-28

This was more of a romance than a romantic suspense, but it had a lingering tale of suspense weaved into the plot. The characters were richly developed and it is their story that keep the reader drawn to the pages. Ms. Wainscott has an incredible way of making even what seems like an unbelievable situation come to life. Knowing that this is partly  based on true occurences makes it even better. This book reminds me a lot of Nora Roberts writing. It flows nicely and is a quick read. Well worth buying if you are looking for a touching tale of romance and finding that one special person that makes your heart beat like no other.	2005-07-25

The suspense carried out until the very end and as usual the author does a good job surprising the reader. Even though you may have your suspicions, you aren't quite sure until the reveal. Some of the characters really came off as bitter people and never did redeem themselves. That was a little unsettling, but other than that it was enjoyable. <br />Mind what you read by some of the other reviewers. This is not a romantic suspense like some say. It is also not as much of a thriller as it is made out to be. It is a straight out suspenseful mystery. People are being killed, and everyone is a suspect, yet finding the murderer is not as easy as it looks.	2005-07-23

It was suspenseful, but I didn't really get how the other readers considered it to be funny. There isn't one line in it that I can remember as making me laugh, but maybe I just didn't get the joke. Anyway, I felt the author did a good job at portraying the character's backgrounds that described their personalities, but as far as the connection between the two, it was not well built.  <br />For being classified as a romance, it did not even come close to filling the genre. As far as a romantic suspense, it is closer to some of the books that lean more to the suspense than the relationship. I just didn't feel the chemistry between the two that the author was trying to get across. As for the mystery part of it, it does pull you along until the end, but also is a let down in a way.  <br />I have come across a few other authors that think they can surprise a reader by hardly mentioning the unsub. The fact is, it is really annoying when you get to what should be the climax and you barely remember who that person is.  <br />This is the first Justine Dare book I have read and only chose it based on the reviews. According to her other books, this is her best. I hate to say it, but if this is the best, than I may not choose to read any of her others. It's not that it was bad. In fact, it had me glued to the pages, but I felt absolutely no connection to the characters and even thought many of them were thrown in needlessly. They were not red herrings, and maybe the author should have had more developed ones. If you are looking for a light read, than you will enjoy this book.	2005-07-21

The villian is easily dislikable even though his identity is not a mystery. Still, it is an emotional roller coaster and well worth the read.	2005-07-20

The villian's thought process and motives are clearly projected by using a pseudo name leaving the reader to keep guessing as to the killer's true identity. To an avid mystery reader, the killer will be a bit on the obvious side, but still keeps you wondering if the author will shock you. There is plenty of sexual tension between the main characters, yet the romance is a bit on the weak side. The suspense is what continues to pull the reader along and for that it is a decent read. To intensify the excitement, try reading this book in the dead of winter when a snow storm is brewing outside. Living in the heat of Arizona doesn't quite capture the full effects.	2005-07-20

I particularly enjoyed how the author emphasized some of the aspects of being blinded after having sight for all your life and how different it is to never having been able to see. The relationships both with the main characters and Martha and her father flow nicely and help the reader connect better. This is an author that I have followed since her first book.

I felt absolutely no sympathy for the character's emotions. The sex scenes were like page fillers that seemed overdone after the first few times. The suspense started out fine and then just lingered with the same question for most of the book until it just started going down, down, down. I was so bored near the end that I had a difficult time finishing it. It was wordy, repetitious and did absolutely nothing for me. I was really hoping for more from this new author. I read in another review someone mentioning how Ms. Low's writing got better for this novel. I guess if you are really fascinated with all the boring bureaucratic mumbo jumbo than you will be captivated by this book. The premise for this story was intriguing, but never quite lived up to its potential. I hope her other books are better than this one. The contrast between the first and the second are night and day.	2005-07-15

It starts out primarily as romance and then the suspense part of the story builds. Later comes the action. Followed by even more sex, which I might add is very intense. <br />If this is any indication of how this new author will write, I can't wait to read her other books. My only recommendation is to approach this novel of it being a romance and not a romantic suspense. It does get suspenseful, but not like you would normally find in the romantic suspense genre. I would compare this author with Cherry Adair's early novels. It has that same feel to it.	2005-07-13

I was curious as to why the opinions of the readers differed so much. I understand both sides to the reviews.  <br />The book started out a little slow at first and did not grab my attention until a few chapters in it, but then it became quite suspenseful and kept you guessing up to the end. However, the author did not have as many red herrings as she should have making the killer somewhat obvious.  <br />I did feel that it was a bit wordy in parts. I don't mind details, but they do have to pertain to the plot as much as possible or describe a place, situation or character. I found myself skipping some of the trivial aspects that clearly did not need mentioning but in briefer explanations. That is just my opinion though. My only other qualm with this particular authors writing is how she separates sections with numbers. I don't get it, but it must be a writers thing. <br />All in all, the book was quite suspenseful once you got into it. I do agree with some of the others that no one should write a review if they do not read the entire book. There have been plenty of novels that I was unable to get into, yet have five star ratings. I know that it was just the frame of mind that I was in at the time.  <br />I had no problem getting swept up with this story once I read the first twenty pages. The author continuously poses new questions to the plot to keep the reader guessing. And even though you may guess who the killer is, you still aren't sure why until the very end. It was a good mystery. <br />I debated on giving this four stars and still am not sure why I only chose three because I did enjoy it, but it just seemed to be missing something that I can not explain and did not seem up to some of the other books I have read that I gave 4 stars to. That does not mean that another person would not think this was one of the best books they have ever read. Hence, why the reviews are so mixed. You really have to read it yourself to form your own opinion.	2005-07-11

I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. There are no red herrings, and no mystery, but it does have suspense and intrigue wrapped with a tale of a man's devotion to protect the woman he feels an overwhelming connection to. I wouldn't rank this book as one of the better ones, but it isn't bad. The characters just didn't touch me enough, but I did enjoy the book. I recommend checking it out from the library though.	2005-07-04

Usually the story lines are similiar as well as the characters. This had some of that, but the magical part of it, made for a new twist to the average story line.  <br />It takes a little bit of reading to really get into the book though. The beginning catches your attention, but then it quickly jumps back in the past and you have to learn about how the characters grew up together and fought until they reached adulthood. That part of it is a bit slow. By the time they do grow up, it gets much more interesting and even touches the heart strings a bit. Not my favorite by Nora Roberts, but it was alright as a contemporary romance.	2005-07-02

However, I found it difficult to get through this book. I felt like I had to force myself to keep reading. It was a bit too drawn out and even boring in parts. There was a great deal of suspense at times, but in between it lacked the page turning quality that I would have liked.  <br />I noticed that the book was written in 1987 which explains some of it. This had to have been one of her earlier works and certain aspects of the story would never be an option now. For instance, Whitney uses credit cards everywhere to pay for things. In todays day and age we all know that leaving a paper trail when you are trying to elude a powerful enemy is asking for trouble. Other parts, just show their age. <br />I am sorry to say that this may be the first one of her books that I did not enjoy as much as I had hoped for. It's not even worth checking out from the library. Skip this one. There are plenty of others by this author that are far better.	2005-06-30

They are reviews for other Tina Wainscott books. Furthermore, what Harriet Klausner writes is all mentioned in the first chapter so she isn't giving anything away in her summary. It is in fact what the story is all about.  <br />As for the book itself, I enjoyed the characters, felt the draw they had for one another but the suspense was minimal. It is in the true sense of a contemporary romance, but not a lot of sex. Saying that it is a romance, you have to be ready to accept things that would never actually occur in real life, but I can not go into those examples in fear of spoiling it for the reader. The moral of the story is great and worth reading for that point. Other than that, I just don't feel it is worth the money.	2005-06-30

It takes the first thirty pages to really get you interested at the beginning. From there, curiosity is only what keeps pulling you along as far as the suspense part of the book goes.  <br />The characters and the relationship the homeless people have with one another is what this story is all about. As far as that part goes, it is five stars all the way. It was simply a heartfelt tale about a woman who had everything money could buy, yet had no life at all until she was in a tragic explosion and faced to fend for herself amongst the homeless. Her husband hardly realizes that she exists until he believes she is dead. Then he will throw away everything he has worked for to find her. <br />The ending was not as solid as it could have been. NO surprise endings, no clever twists in the plot.  It is not a romance in the traditional sense, but that is as close to a genre as I can put this one, because the suspense is not that intense. All in all. This is a very touching story, but I recommend you check it out from the library instead of buying it.	2005-06-27

She is left with the man's teenage daughter who doesn't care for her much.

Now six months later, the daughter's best friend is found murdered on Blaine's property and the act is made to look like suicide. The evidence quickly shifts to Blaine as she continues to find other victims. Logan tries to give her the benefit of the doubt, but even he finds it hard to believe it is coincidence. The killer is definitely fixated on Blaine. The closer she gets to finding the truth, the more her life is in jeopardy. Can she get out of this nightmare before it is too late? <br />	2005-06-25

I read She'll never tell and was a little disappointed when the killer's identity is not revealed because it was an ongoing trilogy. I was unable to buy the second in the series, but I don't think it was even necessary. Unfortunately, if you do not read at least the first book, you will not even know who the killer is because he is mentioned only briefly. Here's a little bit of what these books are about. <br />A serial killer called the BLOODSUCKER is taking women and bleeding them to death. He is a face in the crowd, someone everyone knows yet does not see. The first book reveals three of the murders. The second reveals two more. The last is the best, but can not stand alone.  <br />The police chief Claire Drummond has been working the serial killer case all summer. The town is a small resort community that refuses to let her haul in any good citizens for questioning. Instead, she must use her gut instincts to find the twisted individual preying on blonde women with blue eyes. The state police are getting ready to move in with a task force, and Claire will have to relinquish her command. She has a theory about who the killer is, but no one will listen. Only one person believes her. With no one else to turn to, Claire finds more than just a confident in Graham Simpson the town councilman. She wants a relationship with the man, but feels it is the wrong time. She also has a teenage daughter going through the goth stage and hanging out with a possible suspect. The killer has developed a fixation for Claire. Can she find him before it is too late?  <br />The writing is suspenseful, but I think dragging out the theme for three novels is a little too much. After reading the first book, I was ready for the reveal. I had my suspects, but if the killer's identity had been revealed at the end of \\"She'll Never Tell\\", it would have been a surprise. Even though I read these two books back to back, I just didn't think the reveal was climacticenough. The suspense was, but it just drug on too long. If I would have read all three, I think I would have been even more frustrated. Some books you just don't want to end because of the characters. Don't count on that with this series, and don't expect much from the romance.  <br />Don't buy this book unless you plan on reading at least the first and last. Having not read the second, I can't comment on how it was, but I am glad that I couldn't find it at the time it was purchased. I much rather would have liked to check this out from the library had I known what I know now, but since I couldn't find them there, I made the mistake of buying the two books. I am only glad that I did not only buy one.  <br />This author has some potential as long as it is a stand alone novel. The writing is good and there are enough red herrings to keep you guessing up until the end so maybe her other books will be less drawn out. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-22

If you read the book synopsis,  you think that it is all about a woman who was fat and a little unattractive until she is in a horrible car accident and has to have extensive plastic surgery. Without any previous pictures of the woman, her husband uses one from her twin sister. After six months being in a coma, the woman awakes to find herself looking like an entirely different person and not trusting those she loves.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there is a serial killer on the lose who has fixated on her. He kills blonde haired, blue eyed women by slowly draining their blood. The police chief Clair Drummond is on the case, but is coming up without any leads. This part of the book does not have an ending. You will read up until the last page expecting the reveal only to see that it concludes into the next book. After reading that one, you will also be left hanging. The killer's identity is not revealed until the last in the trilogy entitled \\"SHE'LL NEVER LIVE\\" You must read at least the first and the last to know who the killer is. It can be very frustrating if you are not willing to read the others.<br /><br />The suspense in this book is not near as good as the last, however it isn't too bad for this author's first book. I just think that the theme was drug out too much. For a romantic suspense novel, I wouldn't say there is much in the romance part of it. I was however unable to purchase the second in the series and I am kind of glad. The first book frustrated me enough that I don't know that I could have gotten through a whole other book without knowing the killer.<br /><br />ONLY READ THIS BOOK IF YOU CAN GET THE OTHERS. THIS IS CRUCIAL.	2005-06-22

I was anxious to read Jane and Trevor's ongoing relationship, but my thoughts were 'get it on already'. The sex seemed forced and I did not feel the attraction like in the previous book. I love Iris Johansen, but I agree with other readers, her style is once again changing. She went through the transition with Ugly Duckling which proved to be well worth it, but the last couple of books are suddenly steering away from the romantic suspense genre and leaning toward straight fiction. She still has a talent for creating some of the best twists and turns and surprise endings, but I really wish she would create another book like The Killing Game. That is the one that made us all fall in love with Eve and Joe.  <br />Okay, now that I've gotten off the track. Countdown is not bad. Hopefully the next book will have more romance for Jane and Trevor. If you read this book knowing that it is just a very good suspense, you will not be disappointed. However, do not make this your first Iris Johansen book otherwise you may not want to read the others which are very good.	2005-06-19

It had a couple decent twists and even a surprise ending. My only problem with the book was her excessive wordiness to constantly interrupt dialogue with actions as if it were a screen play and we needed to know the blow by blow of what the characters did with their hands.<br /><br />The book was about a serial killer, yet we only had one actual look at how the killer worked and only one victim's body. Therefore it lacked a little of the intensity and fear that a serial thriller may have. Nevertheless, the attraction between the two characters was not immediate in the sense that the reader could feel the emotion, but built quickly and only got intense from there.<br /><br />All in all, I think the author has potential and I hope to read more of her books.	2005-06-19
US	18323018	RTNGCMYHLRM0I	0778320375	946108499	In Silence	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Not for the squimish	It still amazes me why this author is classified as writing romance and even romantic suspense. The romance part of her books is weak at best. In this particular novel it seemed forced and nothing led into the sex scene. No friction, no deep seeded lust, just one minute they're fighting and the next they are falling into bed together.  <br />The suspense and mystery part of it is very good. Even though the killer was obvious you still aren't quite sure all the particulars. My only qualm with it was that the author did not use enough red herrings to keep you guessing. Nevertheless, I continued reading through in one sitting to get to the end.  <br />I have read other Erica Spindler books and have never quite enjoyed her style of writing. Maybe it's just me, but I've come to expect a little more in this genre. The book was 458 pages and yet I never really felt any connection to the characters. The only positive point to this novel is the unique story line and continuous suspense throughout the book. I do have to warn you though, this book does get a tad on the graphic side. It could be too much for some people to handle. If you can not get through the prologue, you will not be able to handle the rest of the story. So buyer beware.	2005-06-12

I have not read the Ugly Duckling for a few years and yet it has stuck with me ever since.  <br />It is one of those stories that any unattractive girl might dream of, omitting some of the tragedy of course. Everyone wants to be beautiful and feel desirable. This story is about one woman who gets that chance. Her life has been ripped apart by tragic circumstances, and yet she is forced to carry on to uncover the mystery. Like other books by Iris Johansen, you will not be disappointed with the twist. I highly recommend reading this one, but just to let you know. It is not as suspenseful as many of her other books. I think this may have been her first book to cross over into the romantic suspense genre. The Eve Duncan books are still her best for suspense. The killing game is by far her best work yet in my opinion.	2005-06-11

I did notice though that this was the only one in the series that was labeled as a romantic suspense rather than a contemporary romance. I have a feeling the author was trying to expand yet did not do the best job. She tried to keep the suspense going throughout the book, and even tried shocking the reader with her surprise ending, but it was very anticlimactic as another reader mentioned. I have read books much worse, but do not believe that this particular novel is one of her best. It is just an okay read. Check it out from the library rather than buying it. That way you won't be too sorry that you spent the money.	2005-06-11

Like Tempting Fate, this book made me cry and feel for the characters.  <br />The down side of the book is that there is very little suspense and no mystery at all. There is no surprise ending and no twists and turns. However, if you are just looking for an emotional read in the contemporary romance genre than you will enjoy this book, but maybe you should check it out from the library instead of buying it.	2005-06-09

The only thing that bothered me was the religion that did not fit with the plot at all. It felt like I was watching some tv commercial for the book of mormon in several parts. I have read many books that used religion and did it well. This one seemed forced. I really felt like the author was trying to convert me and I already am a christian. It was just a little too over the top and the only reason that I did not give this book 5 stars. It is also the reason that I will most likely not read any other books in the series. It is very unfortunate because the characters are very likeable and you instantly want to know more about the other members in the family, but if the religion is as bad in the others as this one, I will pass. I just don't like preaching and that is what this book does, not subtle hints but out right threats. Either Kate must believe and become a christian, or Dave will not even date her. It just seems too unbelievable that he wouldn't even kiss her until she finally found god.	2005-06-08

It is filled with suspense, lots of sex, compassion, untold secrets, murder, greed, and so much more. It is a good light hearted read. Even the identity of the killer is a surprise and that is rare to find in murder mysteries. In my book, if an author can surprise me, she deserves 5 stars.  <br />Meryl Sawyer definitely has a way of making the reader connect with her characters. You'll find yourself remembering them long after the book has gone back on the shelf.	2005-06-08

However, this book I read years ago and it has never left the back of my mind. It is eerie, and down right scary to think that you never really can know everything about a person until you live with them, and then you just may not want to. If you are a single woman looking to find the man of your dreams, read this book only to know what to beware of.<br /><br />I actually had a really hard time reading this only because it creeped me out so much. If you like a good thriller, than this one is for you. There is no guessing to who the bad guy is. You can only wonder if she gets away before it is too late.	2005-06-03

I don't know if it is my favorite, but I think it very well could be. It was suspenseful from the very start and never let up. The mystery part of it was wonderful and I love it when the author shocks me. You will not be able to figure out the suspect until the very end. The twists and turns in this book kept pulling me along and confusing me just the same. I loved this book to say the least. The relationship between the main characters was well developed and flowed well with the story line. This was the first Tina Wainscott book I have read and it will most definitely not be my last. If you want a suspenseful romantic mystery, this is the book for you. You will not be disappointed.	2005-05-31

From then, it didn't let up. It was not the best mystery I have read, but I gave it five stars because very seldom does an author stump me. I did not expect what I was reading. The killer's identity comes as a surprise and I usually figure it out right away. I look forward to reading more books by this author.	2005-05-29

Like another reviewer mentioned, there are plenty of suspects to keep you guessing up until the very end. The book did not blow me away, but was okay. I thought the book would be more of a romantic suspense, but it really was not. The characters are clearly infatuated with one another, but they only kiss once during the whole story, and nothing ever developed with that aspect of the story. Other than that, I enjoyed the book and will most likely read more of her books.	2005-05-27
US	18323018	R2UKHPGQYCRHFT	155166965X	701034441	Sweet Baby	Books	4	16	17	N	N	If only all men could show this much love	From the very beginning, you feel sympathy for Tory Lancaster. What it would be like to only be six years old and come home to an empty house and your entire family gone. Luckily twenty five years later she has fallen in love with a man whose only concerns lie with Tory. His love is genuine and although it seems far fetched from reality to meet a man with that much compassion for a woman, romance books are of interest to most women for the mere fact that they want to experience something that they themselves have never witnessed in a man. Brett Hooker is unlike any other man, and you can't help but to wish that some man cared for you with that same amount of passion.  <br />This story is one of those ones that hit you square in the chest. It is not suspenseful in an action packed way, but there is that element of being a low key page-turner. You can not help but get a little choked up while reading this book. It will tug at your heart strings on a couple different levels. It is classified as a romantic suspense, but I would classify it much more as a contemporary romance with a hint of suspense. If you are looking for an action packed suspense with a touch of romance, than this book is not for you. On the other hand, if you would like to read something that will clearly make you feel the power of love than buy this book.	2005-05-23
US	18323018	R1Y4I896O1C1LG	0553571885	34141079	A Thin Dark Line	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Suspenseful from 1/3 of the book on.	This book is almost 600 pages long. The first chapters are a bit confusing as it jumps back and forth between a killer's thoughts and reality. Plus, there are a lot of characters names to familiarize yourself with at the start and this can be a bit much. The french-cajun phrases did throw me off at first, but then I finally found the glossary of terms at the end of the book. The first 150 pages are slow and tedius, but set the background. I think a lot of this could have been summed up quicker, but if you can make it past that point, the suspense does begin to build quickly and does not stop until the very end.  <br />This plot was a bit creepy in the sense that I found myself checking the locks on the doors as I read late into the night. It did not help that the story line is about a serial rapist/killer who sneaks into women's homes at night when they are in bed and alone, which I was when I read this book. All in all, I would have to say that for a susense/thriller it was fairly decent.  <br />There is even a touch of romance thrown into the plot, but you don't see any signs of that until near page 200. The one thing I did like about that in comparison to other romantic suspense novels is that the relationship seemed a bit more realistic in the sense that it was not instant. Over the course of working together side by side and having their lives turned upside down, the two find themselves bonding with one another when they normally would have held up their defenses. The only part of this that bothered me was that in a book of almost 600 pages, you would think that the author would really express what emotions the characters were feeling or some more of their past that made them who they were. Both of them were tough, and stubborn cops who clearly had a haunted past, but not much of that was mentioned. Brief sentences hinted to more, but the story line was never developed. <br />Clearly, the main focus was on justice and injustice. The thin line between right andwrong and how people deal with that. It was not the best Tami Hoag book that I have read, but if it was enough to scare me into checking the locks, than I give it four stars. It will keep you guessing up until the end, even if you think you know who did it, you are never quite sure until the truth is revealed.	2005-05-22
US	18323018	RD74GHYFDT6MQ	0671019708	691382940	After the Night	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Wonderful	I have to say that this was possibly one of the best romance novels that I've read. You can't help but connect with the characters. I could not put it down. It is a great read. <br />As far as suspense goes, it isn't the type of book that grabs you from the very beginning, but a real question does arise and keeps you guessing until the end. Here's all you really need to know to get you through the first few chapters before you start asking yourself what happened. <br /> <br />What happened that one steamy night in Prescott, Tennessee was enough to put the town in an uproar. Two families lives were forever changed by the circumstances, but what they believe to be the shocking truth, could be a cover up that lies in waiting for twelve years. Did Gray's father really run off with the town whore leaving his family without any explanation? Faith, the woman's youngest daughter suspects foulplay, but as she begins to uncover the truth, someone does not like her prodding into the past. Her life is in danger. She can not fight the feelings she has for a man she has loved since she was a child. Yet he is the same man who wants nothing more than to see her leave town. It is up to Faith to solve the mystery that happened all those years ago without hurting the man she loves in the process. The only problem is that someone will stop at nothing to make sure the secret stays locked in the past. <br /> <br />	2005-05-21
US	18323018	R1HVA0XW6EHDX5	0553803166	425970234	Hunting Fear	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Emotionless main characters	I am still not quite sure what to write about this book. I did enjoy it. The beginning did grab me from the start. The whole fear issue was a bit chilling at times, but I still feel some things could have had improvement. <br />First, I didn't feel enough emotion from Lucas and Samantha. Too much about the past was vague and unanswered. Maybe something was mentioned in one of her earlier books that I haven't read, but I did not sense any of what I think the author was trying to get across. The characters constantly fought with oneanother. You know they have a past that ended poorly, but you never got a strong sense of emotion. You are left to assume and just take it for what it is. I wasn't looking for a romance or even romantic suspense in this, but I did not feel any real connection with the main characters. <br />The paranormal pyschic story line was intriguing and I did enjoy that part of the book. The suspense was fairly decent and kept me guessing. My only problem with this is that the book was labeled a mystery. When I see that, I expect to have to use the clues however subtle they may be and try to figure out who done it. This one came up a bit short in that area. I can not go into it anymore without giving more away. The ending definitely led into the next book and possibly many others in the fear series. I only hope that the author develops her character relationships better from here on out.  <br />Other than those few remarks, I mostly enjoyed the book. Maybe I'm asking for too much, but the way I look at it, if the author wants you to continue buying the rest of the books in the series than she should make you connect with the characters. I actually felt more for the secondary people than the main ones.	2005-05-20
US	18323018	R1YY7ZRN7VNLQX	0821776673	708617452	Tempting Fate	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Get ready to cry	If you are looking for a book that will tug at your heart strings, but still keep you held in suspense throughout the book than this one is for you. I would liked to have seen a few twists in the plot. Sometimes the bad people seem to repeat the same scenario over and over and although you don't know who they are until the very end, you never really seem to feel much of anything for them. The villian should be easily dispised or blow you away with the realization that they are some one entirely different than you expected. This one did not do either for me. Nevertheless, the climax near the end was extremely suspenseful, filled with action and emotions. I really did enjoy this book and would recommend it. The ending is what has stayed with me even sometime after I read this book.	2005-05-18

I think this book was very suspenseful and kept you wanting to continue turning the pages. Some books you can read and the story line simply slips out of mind. You can't remember who the characters were or what the plot was about. This story has stayed with me so well that I can remember it in great detail. It is suspenseful throughout. You will definitely hate the drug lord and grow quite a fondness to the main characters. Is the story believable? I certainly wouldn't want to be anywhere near those type of people, nor do I know any, but it is entertainment.	2005-05-18

Of course during those times, they were busy as bunnies. My only qualm with this story is that there were not enough red herrings to throw you off. It could have been very surprising, but I wasn't fooled because I had no one else to suspect. It did make me cry at the end though, so I gave it 4 stars for the raw emotion.	2005-05-18

This story is action packed from the start. It is continued with a great deal of suspense. No huge surprises, but a really good book nonetheless. The sex scenes are steamy and one of the most memorable I've ever read is in this book. The constant danger will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. This is a very good book, but then all of Cherry Adair's books about the Wright Brothers are excellent. I highly recommend buying them.	2005-05-18

Other than that, it was very good. The suspense did pull you along fairly well. The relationship did seem to move rather abruptly but it was a romantic suspense novel so you kind of expect it. I read it in less than a day and so it must have kept me interested enough to not put it down. I would say all in all it is a good read. I like the John Medina stories the author does and he makes a cameo appearance in this story.	2005-05-18

Her characters are beleivable and filled with emotion. This was the first one of her books I had read and I continued with all of the Wright brothers stories. Marnie is the sister in the Wright family, but you quickly grow a fondness to the whole family and this book sets the premise for the others that follow. It is highly suspenseful and action packed. For the novice reader, even the ending will be a surprise. For those of you who can guess the bad guy almost immediately, it may be a let down. Nevertheless, I am one of those people and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It makes you want to run out and buy the whole series, so why not just do it all at one time.

Not an action packed page turner, but enough suspense to keep the reader from putting the book down. It is a little over 400 pages long, and moves quickly. The author could have developed the characters a little more, but not having all the information concerning thier lives still worked well. I would definately recommend buying this book if you are a fan of romantic suspense. It reminds me a little of a Nora Roberts book.  <br />	2005-05-09

I was expecting a little more action or even suspense, but it was more on the lines of something you might watch on Lifetime Network. A drama begging to be a romance, but not quite cutting it all the way. <br /> <br />Brett Lamont is a diamond designer. Alex Savich is the new owner of Belage Diamonds who wants to make Brett the hottest designer around. Unfortunately he has colored diamonds that interpol will not allow him to use. He must come up with a plan to fool them without anyone finding out his secret.  <br /> <br />Brett has a son from a man she loved deeply who disappeared before she had the baby. For years she has waited for him to return home alive. When word comes of his death, she is catapulted into an affair with her new boss.From there, a series of unfortunate events separate the two and they must deny their feelings for one another.  <br /> <br />It is almost 500 pages long and I found myself quite bored about half way through. The story line got a little exciting for a couple of chapters and then died off again. All I can say is I'm glad I checked it out from the library and didn't go through the hassle of finding a used copy only to be disappointed. <br />	2005-05-08

It was filled with supense and action as well as romance. I'm not quite sure why it is called \\"All the Queen's Men\\" because it has no reference to the Queen or her secret service. I was rather thinking the story line would have a twist or two, but no such luck. That is the only reason I am not rating this at a five. No surprise ending, no unknown killer, just romantic suspense. All in all, a good read.	2005-05-08

The story is supposed to be about Cosmo, Navy Seal from her well known team 16. Luckily, any of her readers have already gotten a good picture of who Cosmo Richter is. Therefore his character does not need to be as thoroughly developed. Unfortunately, the story seems to focus more on a gay FBI agent named Jules, who readers also already associate. Throughout the story, you read about a man trying to figure out whether he is gay or straight and the struggles he goes through to find his way. The story line quickly shifts from the romance of Cosmo and Jane, to Robin and Jules. Then to top it off, it's not as if that part of the romance even has a happy ending.  <br />I really do enjoy her books. I have come to know the characters and whenever their names are brought up in her other stories, I do not feel the need to have more descriptions of them. I now associate with Jules more, but I do have to say that this particular story was not as suspenseful as her others. Too much focused on the gay situation of the story and not much else to keep the reader interested. <br />Aside from that, I will continue to read her other books. I give her props for trying to express how important it is to feel accepted in society no matter what your sexual preference is. This book was clearly written for her son, and I think that is great.  <br />I recommend checking this one out from the library though instead of buying it, because some people may not enjoy it as much as others.	2005-05-08

Not quite as chilling as The Night Before, but still eerily suspenseful. Not much of any romance in this Romantic Suspense, but still a great suspense novel. It really makes you think that they should put latches on the inside of coffins regardless of their main purpose. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I would have given it five stars if not for the lack of romance. I just found it a little hard to believe that they could fall in love after only a few makeout sessions. Even those didn't come until half way through the book. All in all, it was good. <br />	2005-01-14

The romance was definitely different as the two main characters dream about one another without ever meeting for months. As far fetched as it seems. The story and the characters really stayed with me. I just finished reading Lisa Jackson's The Morning After where women are being buried alive in open graves and thought how nice it would have been to have a person that had the gift of sight like the heroine in Mimosa Grove to help catch a serial killer. Throughout that book, I couldn't get my mind off of Mimosa Grove. If the thought of psychic abilities intrigues you in the slightest, you will love this book. Just know that it truly is a romance novel with a paranormal theme.	2005-01-14

It was the characters that pulled me along. I would have classified this book as more romance than romantic suspense, because it wasn't as suspenseful as I had expected, but it still kept me glued to the pages. Most of the excitement happened near the end and left the story open for the sequel coming out in June 2005 \\"In the Dark\\" I am looking forward to reading this next chapter in what will most likely be a series.  <br />This author writes very much like Suzanne Brockmann and you might even think you are reading one of Brockmann's navy seal stories, but just another Seal team and their lives. So if you like her books read Marliss Melton's \\"Forget Me Not\\" and at the same time, if you liked this book, read Suzanne Brockmann.	2005-01-08

At first you are only curious and have certain questions, then the story seems to shift and becomes a little more intriguing. By the climax, you are rivited to the pages and waiting for the outcome. It is filled with twists, and although not as wowing as some books I have read. It is still a fairly good read. <br />The only thing that bothered me was that they listed the book as a romantic suspense. Yes it did have an attraction element that developed into feelings, but not the true romance of it, but then the woman's husband had only just died. It is hard to imagine starting off fresh in such a short amount of time, but as a reader I did feel the pull between Claire and Nick. All and all, it was not bad.	2005-01-06

Approach this book with an open mind and be prepared for a family that have even more problems than those who go on the Jerry Springer show. Even though it was eerie, it was a good page turner and surprisingly there is even romance thrown in.

The suspense was just enough to keep pulling you along. It was not a steamy romance but enough of romance in the story line to make you feel the passion. The author does a good job of keeping you guessing who the killer is until the very moment it is necessary. It makes for a good read because you keep guessing until \\"Bam\\" there it is. I only just finished this a few hours ago and I am still trying to absorb all the information. It is so addictive that you will be done with the book before you know it.

It caught my attention from the very beginning and carried me to the end. I thought it was a fairly good read and was finished without realizing that I had even read that much of the book. <br />I only had a few problems with it. One, I wouldn't say this was a romantic suspense novel. It had a romantic interest to it, but not one that ever amounted to much or really finished. Maybe Mariah Stewart will continue with their relationship in other novels because the characters were interesting and there is a lot of potential with their line of work for a sequel. <br />Two, I was really hoping for a surprise ending. I had read another readers review and thought maybe I would be stumped and shocked, but was a little disappointed when I figured it out early in the story. <br />Last, the story didn't seem to have any kind of finality. Maybe there is another sequel out there. The story had a touch of an ending but still left me hanging.  <br />Nevertheless, it was a good read and I will try more books by Mariah Stewart.	2004-12-10

I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. THE SUSPENSE IS SOME OF THE BEST I'VE READ. THE WRITING KEPT YOU INFORMED WITHOUT USING TOO MUCH SENSELESS WORDING THAT MANY READERS TEND TO SKIP OVER ANY WAY TO AVOID BEING BORED. I'VE READ OTHER KAREN ROSE BOOKS, BUT THIS ONE IS TRULY ONE OF THE BEST ROMANTIC SUSPENSE NOVELS I'VE EVER READ.  <br />BUY THIS BOOK FOR YOURSELF, AND THEN BUY SOME MORE FOR ALL YOUR FRIENDS THAT ENJOY TO READ THIS TYPE OF GENRE. YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY. MANY TIMES, I HAVE READ WHERE READERS SUGEST BOOKS AND I GET THEM ONLY TO BE DISSAPOINTED IN THE END. I CAN NOT TELL YOU HOW GREAT IT WAS TO FINALLY FIND A BOOK THAT MET ALL THE CRITERIA FOR A GREAT NOVEL. DON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU BEGIN TO SEE THE NAME \\"KAREN ROSE\\" AS COMMONLY USED AS AUTHORS SUCH AS NORA ROBERTS OR MARY HIGGINS CLARK. IF KAREN ROSE CONTINUES TO WRITE LIKE SHE DID IN \\"I'M WATCHING YOU\\" SHE WILL SOON PROVE TO BE ONE OF THE BEST AUTHORS OUT THERE.	2004-11-10

I can say that it was fairly suspenseful after it got going, but it didn't quite do it for me. First off, it was too wordy. Many times I found myself skipping the boring descriptions to find the suspenseful stuff. It just seemed to drag on a bit too much with non essential information. Second, it didn't have any good twists in the plot or surprise ending that made you go WOW. Thirdly, and probably the most annoying thing of all was how it left you hanging. Not just like there was another story plot that could be made into a sequel, but like it was missing the epilogue. The story line wasn't completed, the characters didn't have any sort of resolution and it made me frustrated. I got her second novel as well thinking that the characters would be in that one as well and answer some of the questions left at the end, but it doesn't. I have to say that if this is how Anne Frasier is going to write, I won't ever read another one of her novels. She has potential, but needs some reader input before writing anymore. In all fairness, I will say that she did her research well, but once again, it was a little to wordy. She did have a knack of keeping you turning the pages, but it only led to a great let down at the end. If you like books that Keep you turning the pages, give you twists and turns throughout, has a touch of romance in as well, and then and leaves you in complete suspense until the very end only to stun you even more, than try reading Iris Johansen. Start with the Face of Deception. That is the first one in the Eve Duncan series. The Killing game is the next and that is the best by far. Iris Johansen will not leave you dissappointed as Anne Frasier does in HUSH.	2004-08-29

It is suspenseful and does surprise you at the end. Even when you think you know what's going to happen, she puts a good spin on it. It was suspenseful and did keep me reading, but if you are looking for a ROMANTIC suspense, you will be disappointed with \\"See Jane Die.\\" ALso, try to avoid reading the discription of this book on the back. It gives too much away and you know exactly what is going to happen. All in all it was a good read.	2004-08-19
