US	49065018	R10BCYF7OXZCWW	0060929871	949556910	Brave New World	Books	5	0	2	N	N	Haunting	This is a book I won't soon forget.  It tells the story of a utopia in the future, manufactured children, reconditioning, and simply of human nature.  Aldous Huxley does an amazing job at taking such an advanced topic and making it seem somewhat real.  I was disturbed by Brave New World, but also fascinated.  His characters are developed to the perfect degree, and while eloquent in his words, he is also readable.	2000-11-27

I'd started it a couple of times but never got around to completing the book.  Then, I resolutely decided to read it, and I found it completely entrancing.  You get something from this book about Brooke that you could never get from a biography: his yearning, passion, anger.... all in his very own words.  It was hard for me to put down, and any fan of Brooke's should most definitely look into it.	2000-11-27

It tells the story of a popular geisha during  the early 20th century.  While the end is lacking and disappointing, what  precedes it is fascinating.  Golden delves into the culture of Japan and  how geisha fit into it.  He writes the story richly and convincingly, a  most excellent read.	2000-08-09
US	49065018	R7HMDSWIPIETM	0140277293	517270591	The Inheritance	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Dramatic love story	Edith Adelon is an orphan that was taken in by a rich family.  She lives  as both a servant and a member of the family.  She meets Lord Percy, and  they fall in love with each other, but a jealous Lady Ida tries her hardest  to keep them from being together.  It isn't what is considered typical  Alcott; it is a love story, taut with drama and betrayal.  It is  simplistically written and sketchy, but it is still written with the Alcott  charm.  I enjoyed it very much, but I don't rate it as  one of my books to  recommend.	2000-08-09

This is a very well written play.  The story is about  Blanch Dubois, a southern belle who comes to live with her sister Stella.   Blanch immerses herself into a fantasy world with a \\"paper moon\\", not  coming to terms with her diminishing looks.  No one suspects her except for  Stella's husband, Stanley, who at first sight, doesn't take well to Blanch.   Williams writes with starkness but maintains his lyricism.  Reiterated, an  excellent play.	2000-08-09

I must also admit, though, that for that very fact,  I didn't enjoy the book.  The book was a comedy of manners on society and  people.  Most of the people were irritating, and I couldn't get into it.  This is not to say that there is a flaw in Austen's writing.  She is a most  excellent authoress.  I was so annoyed by the well-written characters that  I couldn't enjoy them.	2000-08-09

His sister  Laura is a shy, quiet type of girl with pleurosis.  They make up their  family of three, their father having left them.  It may not seem like much  of  a plot, but when you read it, there is an insightfulness, an  understanding of what Tom feels.  Tom, our narrator, calls it a \\"memory  play\\".  We delve into Tom's thoughts and words.  It's a well-written,  heartfelt play, and should be read by anyone who thinks they have a  dysfunctional family.	2000-08-09

Oh, what passion!  It tells the story of Jane Eyre, an orphan who goes to become a governess  and falls in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester.  Bronte doesn't  idealize their love, for Jane is plain, and Mr. Rochester, is not found  handsome either.  \\"Jane Eyre\\" has mystery, romance, and adventure, the  perfect kind of story.  This is my favorite book.	2000-08-09

Polly is a country girl swept into the rich living of her relatives, and  she is content with knowing she isn't rich.  Years later, Polly finds that  her family is in an economic decline.  She tries her hardest to help them  with the abilities of, what she calls herself, an old-fashioned girl.  It  is a good book, but it has some slow spots.  If you enjoyed \\"Little Women\\",  I highly recommend it.	2000-08-09

Keeping in mind that  this was a sketch for &quot;Lolita&quot;, it isn't that bad.  Who can say  that they've written something brilliant without thought on the first try?   Also, keep in mind that it was translated from Russian into English (not by  Nabokov), so Nabokov's usual beauty in writing may be badly put into  English.  If you are interested in reading &quot;The Enchanter&quot;, be it  for the fact that you want to see where it meets with &quot;Lolita&quot;.	2000-08-08
US	49065018	R2YYJORM6LZWZR	0679723161	636015448	Lolita	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Such lyricism	This book IS a work of art.  How can a man born and raised in Europe have such control over the harsh English language; how can he write better than  most of us born into the language?  How can he write things like a Monet  painting: brilliant, bold, lively.  To get aesthetic over the book would be  typical, but how can you not?  If not for the educated Humbert, what would  this book mean?  &quot;Lolita&quot; is about the obsession Humbert harbors  for his step-daughter, Dolores Haze, and their cross-country trek, and  exploration of Humbert's love for Lo, to what extremes he would go to keep  her.  Some may get disgusted that it is about pedophilia, but Humbert makes  it seem like true love.  I highly recommend this masterpiece.	2000-08-08

I gave her this book after I finished it to help her, and she found it  so true and had a good time with it.  I found &quot;Animal Husbandry&quot;  to be funny and true to life, not by my own experiences, but from other  people who've had their hearts broken.  Jane has been broken up with by  Ray, and she develops a theory called the &quot;New Cow-Old Cow  Theory&quot;.  It's funny how she comes to terms with this theory and puts  it to test by the typical &quot;alpha male&quot; Eddie.  It is a very  relatable book and very entertaining.	2000-08-03

I had discovered what book  on the list I had to read a week before the exam, and I read it ravenously,  not because I had to, but because it grabbed me from the first paragraph.   Achebe writes like a classic playwright, in Homeric fashion.  He exposes us  to a culture that few know about and goes into detail the customs.  It's a  fascinating read.  It tells the story of a man and the transition he is  forced to make from old to new.  It's excellent, one of the best books I've  ever read.	2000-08-03

My friend loaned me this book, saying, &quot;You've got to read  this book.&quot;  I was intrigued by the story idea, but after reading it,  I felt stupider for having read it.  The character Amanda is oppressed by  her abusive senator husband and retreats into dreams about a dream lover  named Seth.  She meets a detective named Jefferson Dupree (who  coincidentally looks like Seth), whom, she finds later, out of no cited  incidences, has always been called Seth.  The writing is simplistic, the  story is drab; it is an uninteresting piece of blather.	2000-08-02

I was fascinated by the title and read it without having any idea as to what the content  was.  It is wonderfully written and stark for the time it was written.  It  tells the story of Christopher Isherwood and the time he spends in Germany  during the Second World War.  You confront frank subjects and controversial  topics in this book, and you realize that during World War II, people  worried about some of the same things today, such as unwanted pregnancy and  racism, to name a couple.  Everything you once viewed in an idealized way  during this time period unravels, and you don't really mind.	2000-08-02

The  first story, &quot;Lorraine goes to Livingston&quot;, tells about a  bed-ridden romance author who plans to get revenge on her unfaithful  husband with the help of her nurse Lorraine.  In &quot;Fortune's Always  Hiding&quot;, a soccer thug falls in love with a paraplegic girl who tries  to find the man who marketed the drug that rendered her crippled all her  life.  Finally, in &quot;The Undefeated&quot;, it tells the stories of  Lloyd, a raver, and Heather, a &quot;yuppie&quot;, and their pursuits of  growth.  My favorite is &quot;Lorraine goes to Livingston&quot;.  The  stories are filled with a biting humor and new ideas that are refreshing.   A warning, though: this is not for the easily offended.	2000-08-02

I took it noncommitally and knew eventually  that she would ask.  I read it pretty quickly, hoping for something  interesting, but the relationships are lukewarm, and the plot is only based  on ideas inspiring the writer, probably, after having seen the film.  At  least, unlike the film, the treatment of social classes was a little more  realistic.	2000-08-02

I can say, however, that this metaphorical cow has been milked excessively.   Andrews had perfectly written the story in &quot;Flowers in the  Attic&quot; and &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot;, but the story continues  when an old woman in black moves in next door to Chris and Cathy, who have  married.  Now they have two children, Jory and Bart, who are very  different.  Bart gets drawn into the old woman's home and atmosphere and  takes on a strange attitude after being around the butler and his  propaganda.  I had a weak plot and wasn't as satisfying as her other works.	2000-08-02

(Spanish Edition)	Books	5	1	4	N	N	Charming, amusing love story	The play in which Steve Martin's &quot;Roxanne&quot; was based on is &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, a French play by Edmond Rostand.  The title  character is a witty men, well about words, but has a physical appendage  that all find alarming and engrossing: a large, portrusive nose.  He falls  in love with Roxanne, but she is in love with another man; while he is  beautiful, he's also a veritable dunderhead.  Cyrano agrees to help him  court Roxanne and many funny happenings occur.  This is an amusing play,  sure to charm anyone who can take physical imperfections lightly.	2000-08-02

It tells of Cathy's incline in  the world of ballet, her affairs, and the bitterness she harbors towards  her grandmother, her mother, and her mother's betrayal.  She wants revenge  on the two and will stop at nothing to gain it, but even better is the  longing that Chris has for her, and her passionate relationship with  another prominent ballet dancer, Julian.  I enjoyed this book, and I most  definitely recommend it for anyone looking into VC Andrews.	2000-08-02

There is a historical timeline that parallels goings on in the rest of the world that is very helpful so  that you could get the gist of what's going on at the time.  Also, in the  text itself, it gives definitive explanations to what is happening at the  time so that you can understand fully what the artist is saying or where  he/she is coming from.  For those who do not know classics, bibilical  stories, and other things, there are also good explanations for those, so  the reader/student is enlightened and erstwhile, in comprehension of the  work.  Absolutely the best resource when it comes to art history and the  interpretation of art.	2000-07-28

A Sparks book seems to radiate a charm around it.  The thing, though, that I didn't like too much  about the book was the somewhat unrealistic air that was presented.  Such a  story was so lacking of passion.  I suggest this book for most people, but  not to the fraction of readers a bit more critical.	2000-07-28

They have quite enjoyed the book, and rightly so!   It is a well-written, and although unsuffice enough to say, very funny.   Scott's character recalls hilarious anecdotes and manages to make something  that would normally be serious and unlaughable into just that, a laughing  matter.  I suggest this book to anyone unless you're homophobic; you never  get the full gist of Buddy Cole's flamingness until you read Buddy Babylon.   It's great.	2000-07-28
