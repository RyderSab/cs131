Nothing is more tempting than to start off with \\"Let's look at all the things YOU did wrong.\\"  Instead, you must stop arguing about who's right (which is hard because, well, I AM right), not assume they meant it, and initially abandon blame.<br /><br />Another aspect involves the concept of knowing your identity--sometimes you are going to have to deliver bad news, and they're not going to take it well.  Don't try to soften the blow because that only makes it worse.<br /><br />The next step is to discuss everyone's feelings--not those \\"let's hold hands around the campfire feelings,\\" but the feelings which matter.  It doesn't matter that she corrects your grammar, for instance--it matters how it makes you feel when she corrects you in front of everybody else.  It's much more important to discuss that feeling than the principles of English grammar and pronunciation.  Make sure you let them tell you how they feel, and vice versa.<br /><br />Once you've both expressed how your feelings contributed to the situation, you can talk about how both of you can solve the problem in the future.  Even if you think it's 100% their fault, you can certainly find some smidgen where you can improve to help the situation in the future.<br /><br />One aspect I like about the book is that although you do initially move past the blame and talk about your feelings, you are not a doormat.  The book makes it clear that it is vital that you express why you felt upset, and this book is not about letting people off the hook because of their actions.<br /><br />I think the book is extremely helpful in any business setting, and may also be helpful in personal relationships.  You will find this book helps you manage difficult conversations and make them seem less daunting than before.	2005-10-07

This textbook focuses just on rock and roll.<br /><br />The first few chapters cover the roots of rock n' roll:  the basics of blues, boogie woogie, and other popular styles in the years after World War II.  The authors spend a large chunk of pages on Rock's ascendance from 1964-1974 (about 170 pages).  The period from 1974-1989, as a comparison, receives about 90 pages.<br /><br />The book's strengths are their thoroughness of explanation and clarity of the text.  While the textbook is certainly not exhaustive or complete (somebody always complains that THEIR FAVORITE band was overlooked), all the major styles and bands are discussed.<br /><br />Campbell and Brody do a good job of placing each rock movement within its historical context and tracking the progression of rock through the mid-90s.<br /><br />The pictures and diagrams can be helpful, especially to non-music majors.  The key terms at the end of each chapter are basic, and the study questions are somewhat helpful.<br /><br />One strong criticism (and certainly any R&R textbook will run into this) is its listening examples.  Because these songs are still so popular, it is impossible to get all of the recordings discussed on one set of recordings.  The discography at the back of the book shows that most of the songs discussed are on several anthology CDs, but there are many which have to be bought piecemeal.  Once again, any textbook on rock will likely have this problem.<br /><br />I think undergraduate professors should strongly consider this book for their courses, as it takes a straightforward approach to the subject.	2005-09-02

Taking a very practical approach, Alderson introduces the principles of voice teaching.  Later chapters cover breathing, voice production, resonance, vowels, registers, articulation, and several chapters on choral voices and changing voices (boys' and girls').<br /><br />Alderson is informed about proper vocal technique, and the book's bibliography demonstrates his reliance on the best sources.  Alderson's book seems much more pragmatic than other books on vocal pedagogy like Richard Miller and others.  Alderson also makes many analogies to many other fields, especially athletics.  Many teachers will find this helpful--it can be very difficult to explain to students what they should try to do to correct their singing.<br /><br />At the expense of his practical explanation, some voice teachers may miss some of the \\"nuts and bolts\\" as to what is really going on in the voice.  This handbook does not explain all of the inner workings of vocal production.  Better sources can be found in books by Clifton Ware, Richard Miller, and Oren Brown.<br /><br />Fans of good aesthetics will probably also wish this book had a different cover (this one shouts, \\"Welcome to the 1970s!\\").<br /><br />All that aside, this is a useful book and voice teachers will find it helpful.  I would also recommend James McKinney's book as another great resource.  Enjoy!	2005-08-29

I know of it having been used as a high school textbook on American Music.<br /><br />Kingman's book begins with a great introduction of some of the various ethnic/folk musics of the American musical tradition: Anglo-American, African-American, American Indian, and Latino backgrounds.  Part Two looks at music which germinated from the South-Country, Blues, and Rock.  Other sections examine popular sacred music, secular music, jazz, a substantial section on classical music, and a small epilogue on other regional styles.<br /><br />This text is good because it is not too difficult to read and interesting overall.  Kingman does a good job of introducing the music and providing useful descriptions of each style.<br /><br />His bibliographies at the end of each chapter are fantastic, and he also provides many useful project ideas which would work great for high school/college classes alike<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are a host of problems.  First, the section on jazz is too short (30 pages), as well as those on rock (25 pages) and musical theater (20 pages).  Kingman also neglects to put each movement in its proper historical context.  This does not seem to be an important goal for him.<br /><br />Many courses teach either American Popular Music or American Art/Classical music, not both.  There are better texts out there which are more specific.  For a survey course on all American music, this can work, but will certainly need to be supplemented with primary source materials and information on jazz, rock, Broadway, and other areas.	2005-08-04

I later learned about the most famous statement by Carl von Clausewitz, often misquoted:  \\"War is merely the continuation of policy by other means.\\"<br /><br />This book is Clausewitz's attempt to write a summary about war--what it is (and isn't), how wars are fought, and how they are won.  Though it has its problems, it is the standard, the \\"Old Faithful\\" of military treatises.<br /><br />Clausewitz's hypotheses seem basic at first, but many misunderstand the basic points.  War in Clausewitz's eyes is not some large-scale duel or an act of \\"pure\\" aggression, but instead a continuation of policy.  In other words, wars are fought so that the other side will DO something they wouldn't have done unless you fought them (give you their land, money, stop invading your territory, etc.).  Another important point which Clausewitz makes is that one's goal in fighting another war is to destroy the enemy's forces--any other goal (claim territory, destroy morale, supplies, etc.) is ONLY a means to that end.<br /><br />There are other points made, and Clausewitz does his best to stick to facts, not conjecture.  He makes many references to 18th and 19th century battles, some of which can be confusing and irrelevant today.<br /><br />The fascinating thing about Clausewitz's book is that much of it, especially the first section, applies to modern war today, even in the thermonuclear age (and the age of terrorism as well).  Some of Clausewitz's description on what it takes to be a great general is so relevant that could have been written today.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this book has many difficulties.  Clausewitz died before he edited it, and even he agreed that it rambled in parts and needed editing.  Much of the later chapters are too specific with 19th century tactics to be of any use today, and some of his meaning is obfuscated through the German translation.  It can be pretty dry at times.<br /><br />This book is a classic for a reason, however, and probably a must for any military historian.  YOU MUST GET THE EVERYMAN EDITION, NOT THE PENGUIN!  It is vastly superior.  The translation is better, and it contains an invaluable guide in the back on the reading of the book by Bernard Brodie.  There are also two fascinating chapters preceding the book which are also valuable to read.<br /><br />Enjoy this master work!for a reason, however, and probably a must for any military historian.

I have not read every book in the series, but they seem to be similar overall--good but not great.<br /><br />At first one might think a 300+ page book on Baroque music is sufficient.  Palisca begins with the rise of the Baroque ideal, and quickly moves to Italy and the rise of Baroque music there.  Other chapters cover various genres and countries, including lute and keyboard music, organ and clavier music in Germany, dramatic music in England, sacred music in France, and J.S. Bach.<br /><br />Palisca's writing seems good for undergraduate music majors-the reader needs a strong background of musical terms and concepts in order to get the most out of the book, but it is certainly not too dry or cerebral.  The musical excerpts in the book are illustrative of Palisca's points, and the bibliographies at the end of each chapter are particularly helpful.<br /><br />The main problem of this text is its inability to comprehensively address all of the music.  While J.S. Bach does receive his own chapter, he only gets twenty pages.  Palisca really covers only a couple of concertos in this space, ignoring all of Bach's other works.  This happens in a number of places.<br /><br />What this book had going for it was the fact that there were not any other texts out there which were any better.  Professors had to choose between this text and the Bukofzer text from the Norton Series written in 1947 (music scholars have uncovered a great deal of information about Baroque music since the Korean War).  I have not read the new Norton book by John Walter Hall, but if it's anything like the others, it will beat Palisca's text with regards to information, scope, and scholarship (though probably not readability).<br /><br />Professors teaching an undergraduate course may still go with Palisca's book, but they should be prepared to supplant the text with other materials.  It may be a good teaser to those with possible interest in Baroque music, and can be used as a reference/springboard to other topics.t in Baroque music, and can be used as a reference/springboard to other topics.	2005-07-30
US	51038699	R5C0IEA6JARB7	0192834975	694327261	Tom Jones (Oxford World's Classics)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Slightly too long British novel, but still quite good	Heralded as a classic, this eighteenth-century British novel has a Dickensian feel to it in parts.  I found it to be very entertaining and a thorough novel.<br /><br />Tom Jones, our protagonist, was the son of common parents.  He is adopted by Mr. Allworthy, a venerable gentleman, who raises him alongside Mr. Blifil, Allworthy's nephew.  Blifil does not like Tom and constantly schemes to get him in trouble.  Tom is a good boy, and eventually falls in love with Sophia Western, the daughter of Allworthy's neighbor, Squire Western.<br /><br />What follows is a delightful tale with a host of characters.  Though, as I said before, there are Dickensian elements in the novel (with character names such as Allworthy and Thwackum), Fielding's book has some notable differences.  Dickens has a very descriptive narrative style, filled with images and references to the physical items within the story.  Fielding, on the other hand, is more apt to discuss aspects which are only tangentially related to the story-sometimes he ignores the story altogether.<br /><br />The novel also seems to sway in its genre--at times it is a romance, at times a novel about class (most English novels are about class), and occasionally it reads like an epic philosophical allegory.  Though long, Tom Jones is filled with entertaining twists and turns.<br /><br />Any fan of a Dickens book will enjoy Tom Jones--if you tire at long novels, however, this one may not be for you.  I particularly enjoyed the varying chapter titles, which were often comic, self-deprecating, and overly descriptive.	2005-07-30
US	51038699	R1AN0B2LD4D236	0385512457	435864139	America's Secret War: Inside the Hidden Worldwide Struggle Between the United States and Its Enemies	Books	5	14	16	N	N	Fascinating look at the International Chess Game	This is a fascinating book about American foreign policy both leading up to and following September 11, 2001.<br /><br />Though Mr. Friedman's topic seems impossible to address without some political angle, Friedman takes a \\"Dragnet\\" approach--\\"just the facts.\\"  He explains the goals and aims of Al Qaeda, the history of American presence in the Middle East during the Cold War, and explains Al Qaeda's motives in attacking the United States on September 11.  He then discusses the response of the United States in great detail around the world, but focusing on the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.<br /><br />The most fantastic aspect of this book was that it opened my eyes to the chess game of diplomacy which is going on way over our heads.  Friedman explains what the U.S. government had to do in order to get other countries to cooperate (every country stated PUBLICLY that they would cooperate, but many were not as helpful in substance).  The flare-up between India and Pakistan several years ago was a result of the U.S. using creative diplomatic pressure.<br /><br />There are also other points Friedman makes in this book which raise larger questions I have about government and politics.  For instance, in the initial days of the Afghanistan invasion, the media made big headlines about the troops in Afghanistan being \\"bogged down\\" and moving very slowly.  The U.S. government actually wanted to create this impression in order to keep the Taliban from retreating too soon.  By staying around longer to fight, the United States hoped to destroy more of the Taliban before they got the chance to melt away.  This makes me wonder: was the government trying to deceive the media to report the \\"bogged down\\" story?  Was the media a willing participant in the interests of national security?  Did the government actually do anything to create such an impression in the media's eyes?<br /><br />The most significant question which Friedman's analysis leads to is this: if international diplomacy is this complex and secretive, then what exactly does my democratic vote stand for?  Friedman's thesis for the reasons leading to the Iraq War were completely ignored during the 2004 Presidential election (and it seems clear that both political parties prefer it this way).  What message does it send if I vote for the candidate who is a \\"flip-flopper\\" or vote for the candidate who \\"rushed into war without a plan for peace?\\"  These slogans have nothing to do with the real issues--what should be the role of America in the world post-9/11, how do we get real international cooperation against Al Qaeda,  should Al Qaeda be treated as a group of criminals or an army of soldiers, etc.  These are tough, important questions.<br /><br />No book is without its shortcomings, and Friedman's text has some limitations.  First, some of his analysis is wrong.  I have no idea which information is incorrect, but it is safe to assume that Friedman himself is not 100% right.  Because each of his points is so clearly stated and convincing, it is virtually impossible to know what is true, and what is erroneous.  This is difficult to keep in mind while reading.<br /><br />Also, I wish the title did not have to contain the word \\"Secret.\\"  Though the war is certainly hidden, those who don't bother to read the book may think the \\"secret\\" is that the war is about oil, the desire for revenge against Saddam, or any other of the groundless conspiracy theories (from any political angle).  Those who read the book, however, will know better.<br /><br />Friedman has written an epilogue to the book which can be viewed on the web (just Google the author's name, title, and \\"epilogue,\\" and you'll find it).  There is not much new information, but it gives his most recent update on the government's activities to thwart a terrorist attack before the 2004 election, which is the most interesting piece of information you've never heard.  Anyone interested in politics, foreign policy, and military strategywill be impressed by this book.  You'll love it!	2005-06-15
US	51038699	RKV98XXHXSEF0	0134000455	946384645	Music in the Renaissance (2nd Edition)	Books	4	13	13	N	N	A Good Text, but Atlas' is superior	This book is part of the Prentice Hall series, containing one book for each genre of Western Art Music (Medieval, Baroque, Romantic, etc.) as well as some non-Western music.    The book begins quickly with discussion of John Dunstable and the early English composers.  Later chapters cover Dufay (and Binchois), Ockeghem (and Busnois).  This encompasses the first quarter of the book--the early Renaissance.  Later sections focus on Josquin and his contemporaries, the post-Josquin generation (Willaert, national styles and music of the reformation), and the last chapter covers the greats of the late Renaissance (mainly Palestrina, Lasso, Victoria, and Byrd).    Brown's book is designed to be a good undergraduate/graduate text for music majors, and in this respect it is pretty good.  Brown's prose is informative and sufficiently analytical.  His bibliographies at the end of each chapter can be helpful for those looking for additional information, and he seems to spend the right proportions of pages to those composers of greatest significance (Josquin, Palestrina, Byrd, etc.).    In terms of thoroughness of the information, Allan Atlas' book (part of the Norton series) is clearly better.  It's almost twice as long, and its accompanying anthology allows for more thorough study.  It's newer than Brown's book, which means that its scholarship is more up to date (for instance, some information we thought we knew about Josquin's history has turned out to be untrue).    Brown's book is not bad.  In fact, I prefer Brown's organizational approach, which focuses on the composers one at a time instead of hopping around from genre to genre like Atlas'.    Both books are written with the music scholar in mind--you will be expected to know some of the church modes and the like--but Brown's text is much more accessible to the casual reader.  I enjoyed reading it, and find it to be a suitable text.	2005-06-14

It's good overall, but not great.<br /><br />The book begins with the initial \\"split\\" in America between \\"Classical\\" and \\"Popular\\" music in the nineteenth century, with minstrel shows and brass band music.  The following chapters cover social dance and jazz, Tin Pan Alley, \\"race\\" records and \\"hillbilly\\" music, swing, postwar era music, Rock `n' Roll, the British Invasion, the 1960s, the 1970s, outside influences on 70s music (reggae, punk, funk, progressive country, etc.), the 1980s and MTV, and the rise of \\"alternative\\" music.<br /><br />There are some great aspects about this textbook.  First the prose is well-written, informative, entertaining, and thorough from a social/cultural standpoint.  The book does not make any significant omissions, which is not easy considering all the subject matter which must be covered.  Also, with two CDs included with the book price, the textbook does provide a good value.  This is a nice feature.<br /><br />I was able to find some serious drawbacks to the book, however.  The book seems to focus more on the cultural aspects and less on the musical aspects of each section.  The analyses of the musical tracks on the included CDs are too fluffy.  It is likely that students will not get enough from the book to understand why the music is so special.  Also, while 2 CDs may seem like a lot of music, it is really inadequate to chronicle the history of jazz, blues, musical theater, rock `n' roll, alternative rock, and so on.<br /><br />There was one minor aspect of the book which also cropped up repeatedly.  The authors seemed a little too eager to inject race into every nook and cranny.  Obviously, racism is a central issue American popular music and deserves a healthy focus.  The book, however, includes racism related not just to singers and performers, but record companies, disc jockeys, and more.  I found it extraneous in some parts.<br /><br />This textbook is very strong, but I would probably recommend And the Beat Goes On by Michael Campbell.  With that series, one can order a 5-CD set, and the textbook, while shorter, has more in-depth musical analysis.  This textbook is very close in quality overall, and is more up-to-date.very strong, but I would probably recommend And the Beat Goes On by Michael Campbell.

So I looked forward to reading another great classic when I picked up Moll Flanders, also by Daniel Defoe.  Unfortunately, it was not as good as I had hoped.<br /><br />Written in the eighteenth century, Moll Flanders is the story of a woman who is born in England, lives a lamentable life filled with many husbands, relationships outside of marriage with bastard children, a decade or so of shoplifting, a bit of prison time, all with success and happiness only in the last few years.<br /><br />As with Robinson Crusoe, the book's best feature can be found in its attention to detail.  When describing her thieving experiences, for instance, Moll Flanders illustrates exactly how each encounter happened with such exactness that one could easily picture the event.<br /><br />Unlike Robinson Crusoe, however, this book dragged a bit more and was more difficult to follow.  When reading RC, I had previously thought that Defoe's omission of any character's name was a deliberate attempt to characterize Robinson Crusoe's detachment as a character (The ship's captain was always referred to as \\"The ship's captain,\\" and nobody ever was referred to by their name).  I was surprised to find that Defoe does this here, and unfortunately it made it much more confusing.  When Moll Flanders refers to a man as \\"her husband,\\" I always wondered which husband it was, since she had been married many times.  Because of this, the men seemed to run together and blend into a generic depiction of a man.  Perhaps this was deliberate, too, but it got to me after awhile.<br /><br />The other problem is that this narrative is much less exciting than with RC, a man who is shipwrecked on a tropical island.  Although the bits about the life of crime are more interesting, the beginning portion of her life unwinds at a slow pace.<br /><br />If people really like Robinson Crusoe, I think they will appreciate Moll Flanders.  I think readers should go for Crusoe first and see what they think of it.go for Crusoe first and see what they think of it.   <br />	2005-05-05

While not perfect, this book does show aspects of Hollywood which they don't want you to see.<br /><br />Written by Andrew Breitbart & Mark Ebner, two Hollywood gossip journalists, this book represents a diatribe of all that Hollywood does wrong.  The first chapters chronicle Hollywood's parenting woes, from their odd concept of family values, unhealthy reliance on nannies, and scandalous behavior at Hollywood High Schools.  Later chapters address the predictable flaws of Hollywood: drug addiction, religious fanaticism, the sexualization of our culture, and \\"left wing dogma\\" of many celebrities.<br /><br />I liked this book for several reasons: first, it's really entertaining and fun to read.  The book is also able to paint a more complete picture of Hollywood than a couple of tabloid headlines, and one can see some of the horrible trends going on today.  Although most reviewers are correct in saying that there's not much new gossip in the book, it is a good compilation of some of what has gone on so far.<br /><br />A book like this is not without problems:  first, it's overwhelmingly negative.  The good Hollywood individuals (and there are some out there) are noted only by their absence from the book.  The book seems shallow and wordy from time to time as well.  More importantly, the book is extremely harsh with regard to Scientology and Hollywood's left-wing bias.  I'm no Scientologist, but I can't imagine any follower of Scientology thinking this book delivers anything other than a frontal assault.<br /><br />Most importantly, this book serves as a wake-up call for me and for the rest of America--WHY DO WE LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE?  Hollywood tells us what to buy, what to wear, how to have fun, what to value in our life.  Yes, there are some good people in Hollywood, but this book provides ample evidence that people need to listen more to their own good judgment rather than Hollywood's.<br /><br />Right-wingers may love this book the most, but anybody who has recognized some of the problems in Hollywood (and doesn't mind a negative book on the subject) will enjoy this quick and fun read.ight-wingers may love this book the most, but anybody who has recognized some of the problems in Hollywood (and doesn't mind a negative book on the subject) will enjoy this quick and fun read.	2005-05-05

King Richard lies in prison in Europe on his voyage from the Crusades.  Meanwhile, the Saxons and Normans are fighting over the remnant of England.<br /><br />Ivanhoe, a disinherited son of a noble who was also on the Crusades, returns disguised as the Disinherited Knight.  Together with the help of a mysterious Black Knight, they fight members of the Knight's Templars, rescue the fair Rowena, whom Ivanhoe has fallen in love with, and perform other feats of heroism.<br /><br />This is a great adventure novel: a disinherited knight who is forced to fight several times when the odds are against him in order to win his love.  Many characters are featured as well, including Robin Hood and his merry men.  Any reader with an interest in chivalry, medieval times, English royal history, or good ol' fight scenes will appreciate this novel.<br /><br />The book does feature a character worth mentioning: Isaac is an elderly Jewish man, and he has a daughter, Rebecca, who falls in love with Ivanhoe.  Though the anti-Semitic rhetoric by some of the villainous characters runs pretty thick at times (this does take place during the Crusades, after all), it's pretty clear the author despises such treatment.  In actuality, Rebecca turns out to be the strongest heroine of the novel.<br /><br />It is clear why this book is still so popular.  It's a great story, with great heroes (and even better villains).

Unfortunately, it proved to be only a portion of what I wanted.<br /><br />The first fifty-three pages of the book do not talk about successful teachers at all, but bring up all the challenges which professors face from both college students and administrations today.  While some may find this enriching, especially those faculty with an interest in assessment and evaluation, I found it boring.<br /><br />Finally, Chapter 4 arrived.  Here were case studies of ten award-winning teacher scholars.  Each entry detailed a class observed in meticulous detail and included highlights from a follow-up interview with the professor.<br /><br />I had expected the rest of the book to analyze the successful strategies of all the professors and come up with some healthy conclusions, but it only came up with generic results, no specific answers.  For example, successful professors seem to express \\"emotional intelligence.\\"  Great.  Successful professors also are good at noticing students' attitudes and needs in class and adjusting quickly to satisfy those needs.<br /><br />The rest of the book was similar to the opening few pages.  It discussed the problems of dealing with diverse students, systemic problems with lack of training for Teaching Assistants, and the need for a comprehensive program for faculty development.<br /><br />While the book is well written and seems to be very well-documented (numerous, current sources), I feel as if the book is not exactly what the cover makes it out to be.  This book may be of particular interest to a professor involved in the region of faculty assessment or professors in Education departments, but I found it lacking in the areas of solid teaching strategies.<br /><br />I did receive some good ideas for my own use in teaching, but I would recommend other books like McKeachie's Teaching Tips before this one.uld recommend other books like McKeachie's Teaching Tips before this one. <br />	2005-04-23

The New York Times Review is quoted on the cover as calling this Beatles narrative \\"The definitive biography.\\"  It's easy to see why.<br /><br />Philip Norman was assigned to cover The Beatles and their company, Apple Corps.  From his inside knowledge and obviously extensive research, he has created a masterful biography of the Beatles which proves to be a fascinating read.<br /><br />Norman begins with the childhood of John Lennon and weaves the other members into the picture effortlessly.  The book covers the lives of the Beatles before meeting, the creation of the band, their time in Hamburg, Germany, their rise to fame in both Great Britain and the U.S., and their lives as superstars right up to their breakup.  Norman also has great photographs, including a fantastic collage of the Beatles' appearance during the 60s.<br /><br />What makes the book so great is Norman's ability to describe the story almost as if it were a fictional novel.  Each bit of sourced material is seamlessly woven with Norman's wonderfully illustrative prose.  He is able to fit the documentary evidence within the context of his narrative in an artful manner.<br /><br />While I am a Beatles fan and knew a lot about them already, I was surprised to find numerous aspects of them in this book which I had not known about before.  I found it interesting that even though I prefer the Beatles' later music, I liked them less as people than when they had been younger--more innocent, playful, and, dare I say it, responsible.<br /><br />There were several drawbacks to the book, but none were too substantial.  I would have loved it if Norman had cited his sources along the way, or at least provided a bibliography list.  This would have been a more scholarly approach--on the other hand, however, this IS a book about four rock stars.<br /><br />I also found the book to be a little heavy with regards to Brian Epstein.  Brian was certainly a close friend to the Beatles, but he gets more words about him than Ringo (perhaps George, too).<br /><br />Are these negatives really important?  NO!  This is a marvelous book for either a Beatles fan or a novice.  I think all would like it.se negatives really important?  NO!  This is a marvelous book for either a Beatles fan or a novice.

When you include \\"Classical\\" music, Jazz, Broadway, and Rock, you can imagine how diluted this book actually is.<br /><br />Because of so little focus, I thought the strongest part of the book was the opening sections on music in the Colonial and Federal eras, including such composers as William Billings.  Once the book approaches the 20th century, however, it really becomes too broad.<br /><br />I really liked the bibliographical notes at the end of each chapter.  Because Hitchcock is unable to say much of anything on each subject, the main value of this book is using as a launching point for further study.  Hitchcock's bibliographical resources on where to find more information are valuable.<br /><br />This book works well for the above purpose, but this book would not work well as a textbook at all, as some other books in this series have been used.  Although it's not particularly engrossing, it can be used to complement your musical interests in music from the U.S.	2005-03-24

This was why I chose to read it, and I must say that I really liked it.<br /><br />When the middle-class Durbeyfield family learns that they are genealogically related to the noble family of d'Urbervilles, they send their beautiful daughter Tess to meet them and possibly receive a fortune from them.  Tess discovers the d'Urberville family is actually of no relation to the real d'Urbervilles, and simply bought their prestigious name while they made their fortune.  Tess stays and works at the d'Urberville household, and gets to know Alec, their son, who, er, treats her quite badly.  I won't give away any details, but Tess has to deal with the results of Alec's treatment, and tries her best, though unsuccessfully, to move on.<br /><br />Though I don't usually go for many of these sappy character dramas, I really like how Hardy brought forth this novel.  One develops immediate sympathy for Tess and her plight, yet she can at times be a very strong woman.  The character development here is fantastic.  I also liked the way Hardy juxtaposes the issue of social class (I think there must have been a law in England that every book in the nineteenth century had to confront social class in some way).  Hardy also brings in symbols regarding Christian sin as well as paganism in this novel.<br /><br />I can see why some people would criticize this book as being slow or dull, but those readers would also probably say the same about any piece of 19th century British literature.  I didn't find it especially slow, however.  If you like books like Pride and Prejudice, Middlemarch, and Wuthering Heights, you'll love Tess of the d'Urbervilles.	2005-03-19

Once I heard about this book, I had to read it.<br /><br />In this book Slonimsky has compiled great stories about music, including those about performers, composers, performances, and inventions.  There are some good anecdotes about composers such as Rossini, who was once composing in bed.  A sheet of music he had written fell out on the floor, and as he was too lazy to pick it up, just wrote another melodic line instead.  Later, a friend came in and picked the original sheet off the ground, and both parts were used as an opera trio.<br /><br />Another great chapter involves music and animals.  It's amazing to read, but there are multiple sources in history which describe the development of a new instrument involving cats.  Each cat in a cage has its tail tied to a keyboard device, when, played like a piano, causes the cat to cry out.  If tuned \\"appropriately,\\" one can create a suitable instrument.<br /><br />Slonimsky has a wonderfully smart method of delivery, and he certainly has a great sense of humor.  My biggest complaint is the fact that there is no index.  Therefore, it's hard to find stories which you're looking for.  Also, Slonimsky leaves out some great stories in music history which are great anecdotes.  But that's to be expected.<br /><br />This is a great book for any music scholar with a sense of humor, or even a casual classical music lover who likes to laugh.	2005-03-17

He is aided by his trusted squire, Sancho Panza, to whom Don Quixote has promised an island over which to rule once he completes his adventures and wins over his only love, Dulcinea.<br /><br />The adventures which follow are exciting and entertaining.  Don Quixote charges at windmills, mistaking them to be giants.  He mistakes a country wench to be Dulcinea who has been enchanted by an evil magician's spell in order to look like a country wench.  In short, he can't distinguish reality from his fantasy.<br /><br />This novel is long, and unless you're a classic literature buff, you can get away with the abridged version.  What makes the book such a classic is the complexity of the characters.  Don Quixote isn't insane all the time--there are times when he seems to know more about reality than he lets on.  Sancho Panza seems like an idiot for following Don Quixote around, yet Sancho goes back and forth between criticizing his master's idiotic notions and adoring some of them as well.<br /><br />Moreover, the source of Don Quixote's madness is his obsession with books on chivalry.  Yet this book itself is a story about a chivalric knight.  By taking this story's message to heart, aren't we committing the same errors as Don Quixote did with his novels?	2005-03-12

In Casals' defense, a book filled with 200+ pages of me talking about my life would be considerably less interesting, but there were some slow spots.  It also annoyed me a little bit that the cello was always spelled in the book as the \\" `cello\\" (short for violincello).  The apostrophe always subconsciously made me read as if the speaker had some sort of street accent.  Just an observation.<br /><br />Though interviews can often be accessible to lay-readers, this interview seemed to presuppose a great deal of knowledge about Pablo Casals, his life, and the musical world in general.  Though Casals was certainly more well known then than he is now, I wish the book could be appreciated by a wider audience.	2005-02-17

James McKinney, the author, is a former student of William Vennard, a great voice teacher and voice pedagogue.<br /><br />McKinney treats his book in a somewhat similar way that the MD might treat a patient (though, naturally, there are many differences between the M.D. and the voice teacher).  I especially like McKinney's concept that the observation begins as soon as the student walks in the door.  How do they stand? Talk? Act?<br /><br />McKinney's chapters cover all the right areas of vocal production all in the right order: posture, breathing and support, phonation, registration, voice classification, resonation, articulation, the speaking voice, and coordination.<br /><br />What I really like about the book is that McKinney dispenses with all the mumbo-jumbo of some voice books and gets right to the point.  During each chapter, he notes the various problems associated with each chapter heading (problems relating to vowels which are too dark) and gives several concrete options for fixing the selected problem.  If there are things McKinney doesn't know about (such as the exact cause of vibrato), he states the latest theories and scientific evidence, gives his personal opinion from his experience, and states that he doesn't really know.  He does all this as well in a very clear fashion.<br /><br />There are two things I don't like about this book, and I must say that they're not extremely significant.  First, McKinney uses phonetic symbols instead of IPA symbols. Also, he doesn't have a conclusion.  The book stops abruptly at the end.<br /><br />But these aren't \\"dealbreakers.\\"  If I had to recommend voice pedagogy books, this would be one of the first, along with books by Clifton Ware, Oren Brown, and Richard Miller (good but more technical).	2005-02-10

It's pretty interesting--what is it that makes something funny?  His second chapter uses some mathematical and logical examples to help approximate what is going on in most examples of humor.<br /><br />Paulos' main thesis seems to be that the most common example of humor deals with setting up the unexpected incongruity.  One of his examples is great.  A perverted old man leers at a young virgin girl and says, \\"What goes in dry and hard, yet comes out soft and wet?\\"  The girl blushes.  The old man replies, \\"Chewing gum.\\"  In this example, the joke implied axioms (answers to his question) which were quite different than his chewing gum answer.  The greater this incongruity is, the better the punchline (which is why sexual connotations are often found funny).<br /><br />Other chapters discuss variations on this theme, culminating in a theory of catastrophe involving dogs and the model for whether they will fight or run away when confronted.  It's quite interesting.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book, and found it to be quite thought-provoking.  Paulos does a great job of explaining many tough mathematical concepts, including G&ouml;del's Theorem.  I didn't fully understand Thom's Theorem at the end, but that's okay.  One thing to be aware of is that the book is short and leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />I think anybody interested in math will find this book entertaining, even if they're not particularly excited by humor.  I do think interest in mathematics is requisite to enjoy this book, however.	2005-01-31

First, unlike other books which start in the 50s, this book starts at 1900(!) and goes all the way through 1999.  Wow.<br /><br />Second, the book has a bunch of other lists that help spice it up.  It lists the top artists of each decade, as well as the top songs of each decade.  There are also 1-page historical blurbs on each decade before the lists so readers can get a quick sense of what the lists signify.<br /><br />Thirdly, the back of the book includes an index both by artist and song title (you can see which songs are reissued), which is also helpful.<br /><br />There will always be a question as to the accuracy of Whitburn's lists early in the century.  Without radio airplay being a factor, it is difficult to take information from various surveys and sheet music/recording sales from that time and have a definitive Top 40 list with no errors.  Another problem with the book is that, well, there's a lot to look at, but little to read.  To the average reader, the novelty of this book might wear off quickly.<br /><br />Popular music fans and musical chart fans will love this book, however, and it is great to generate discussion as well as for reference use.  I don't think it's a \\"must-have,\\" as a good deal of this information can be found for free right on the good old \\"Internet,\\" but it does have its purpose in some instances.	2005-01-14

In many ways this produces a much more readable biography.  For instance, the author writes \\"Paul came to Ephesus with the fall rains,\\" instead of couching her phrasing with \\"probably\\" or \\"it is thought that...\\" This makes the book much better for those who either know little about Paul to begin with, or those who would rather not wrestle with a dry, scholarly book on Paul which is easy to put down.<br /><br />Of course, when adopting a narrative style such as Buckmaster has done, one opens up oneself to criticism that the work is full of misstatements and speculation.  We have no idea what Paul might have been feeling or what he was thinking about at various points in his life, and some of Buckmaster's prose does seem to plant ideas or concepts which, while plausible, are clearly speculative.  In addition to this difficulty, the list of scholarly sources on which Buckmaster relies are probably outdated (pre-1962).  While I'm no Bible scholar, I would venture to guess there are sources written since then which shed new light on this subject.<br /><br />Prospective readers should be also be aware that while the author is not evangelical at all, it is clear that the book is written from a Christian perspective.  I don't expect this to ruffle any feathers (it is about Paul, after all), but perhaps readers should know that this book is not chronicling the Paul of history, but the Paul of Faith.<br /><br />I think this book is good, especially for readers who want to know more about Paul without wanting to pore over a boring, stale biography, and are willing to accept a little Christian speculation.	2005-01-13

Each chapter is written by an expert who knows what they're writing about, and the scholarship is first rate.  I love the numerous excerpts from the score which help illustrate the authors' points.  There are also great bibliographies at the end of each chapter, which can be gold to any thorough student of voice.<br /><br />But here's where the book struggles, and you can probably see this one coming.  Schubert wrote over 600 songs.  The book's chapter on Schubert songs?  A measly 38 pages.  The overwhelming majority of songs are left out, and while some songs are given a fair treatment, many are hastily dealt with.  In the chapter on Brahms, for instance, the author fails to really discuss what's going on in his Four Serious Songs (arguably the best songs Brahms wrote) and completely ignores \\"Von ewiger Liebe,\\" another fan favorite.  Another thing I didn't like about the book is its use of endnotes instead of footnotes (some readers prefer endnotes, but not me), which I find make it harder for me to follow along.<br /><br />Writing a book about 19th century German Lieder seems to me like trying to write a book about U.S. Vice Presidents.  At first, you're asking yourself if you have enough material for a book.  But once you get going, you quickly realize that there's too much information out there, and it's all you can do to touch on each section.  To me, this book is a great start for serious voice students, but it's not sufficient enough to be a complete education on the subject.  What hurts the book even more is that it's too complicated to make for a good introductory text, either(you should probably be familiar with some Lieder beforehand).  The strength of the bibliography and material, however, do make the book somewhat worthwhile.is that it's too complicated to make for a good introductory text, either(you should probably be familiar with some Lieder beforehand).

This book contains his wisdom, advice, and plenty of self-deprecating humor.<br /><br />Dehning begins with a chapter entitled \\"Who,\\" which focuses on what it takes to be a good choral conductor.  He then breaks his book up into chapters such as The Score, The Craft, The Instrument, The Ensemble, The Process, Them, and Us.<br /><br />Dehning makes good points about what we should be doing (namely, conducting and analyzing the score), including a foolproof method for score analysis.  His chapters about the instrument and the choral ensemble are wonderful examples of sound voice pedagogy, aspects of choral blend, and even performance formations.  Some of my favorite parts were tips on how to sing melismas and fugue sections better, and also issues about how to run a good rehearsal (most choral conductors talk WAY too much).<br /><br />While some (and perhaps most) will love it, Dehning's valuable handbook is couched in a writing style which is unceremonious, too much so at times.  Dehning's humor is indisputably successful at bringing the master down off the pedestal, but I found his jokes, mostly at his expense to be occasionally distracting from great advice.  Beginners won't mind, but some conducting elitists might chaff a bit.  Also, there are some great things in the appendix, but Dehning avoids adding a bibliography.<br /><br />That's really all I could find wrong with the book.  I think this book can be a great pedagogical tool to conducting students of all ages and backgrounds.	2004-12-24

The book then begins historically with minstrel songs (\\"Oh Susanna\\" and the like), Ragtime, the Blues, Jazz, Broadway, Tin Pan Alley, Latin Music, and finally Rock and Jazz Fusion (with a little bit of disco and punk).<br /><br />What's great about this textbook is that even it is accessible for undergraduate college students and even high schoolers, the material is presented in a scholarly fashion.  I've not always found that to be the case when it comes to writings about rock music.  You can find a lot of fluff out there.<br /><br />The textbook also has a companion 5-CD set purchased separately.  I feel it is extremely helpful, and the book refers to the recordings ALL THE TIME.  It's really necessary.  There are some songs referred to where Campbell was unable to get the copyright permission, but he has a Discography list at the back of the book for those interested.<br /><br />This book gets four stars mainly because it's so light on rock after the sixties.  The eighties has very little material, and there is only one hip-hop example (Public Enemy).  The book really needs a new edition.<br /><br />Don't use this book for a course on rock alone, but it works great as a text on popular music.	2004-12-05

It's not here	This book is a compilation of 12 essays by some of the leading Mozart scholars of the 1950s and 60s.  While some of the essays are mildly entertaining and helpful, the book struggles overall.<br /><br />Ten of the twelve essays deal with specific genres of Mozart's music-symphonies, concertos, chamber music, serenades for wind band, church music, etc.  Since each section has a different author, the approaches are all somewhat different.  Most of the authors try to briefly mention all the works in each genre while focusing on their favorites.<br /><br />The problem with the book isn't' that it's particularly boring--a rigorous biography of an 18th-century Viennese composer should not be especially gripping--but that it has very few revelations.  The essayists refer often to the writings of noted Mozart historian Alfred Einstein (not to be confused with Albert, the physicist), and Einstein's book seems to be easier to read while just as informative.  Additionally, much has been discovered about Mozart in the last forty years, so this book seems a bit dated.<br /><br />Musicologists will probably want a copy of this around to refer to a few specific pages, but this is definitely NOT a book for people who want a good biography or a look at Mozart as a person.  There are plenty of good Mozart biographies out there, and the Cambridge Companion guides also can be helpful with specific works or genres.	2004-12-02

The beginning contains an introduction covering such subjects as German pronunciation, Bach's cantatas, the Luther Bible, and other editorial notes.<br /><br />The book devotes most of its space to German texts, and this volume is grouped by composer.

I've read the others (excluding Hill's book on Baroque Music not yet released), and while it's good, it's unfortunately the weakest of the lot.<br /><br />The book is geared for graduate study in music, and is a little too heady for beginners (by the way, the book's title refers only to Western music in the Classic Period, c.1760-1830).<br /><br />Downs takes a chronological approach to the subject, but begins with a boring introduction on Eighteenth-century philosophy and musical aesthetics.  This really is a shame, because the rest of the book (if you make it through) happens to be much better.<br /><br />Downs covers the early emergence of Classic music out of the Baroque, and then follows with two short chapters on the first halves of Haydn and Mozart, respectively.  After another interlude on music and other aspects during the Classic Period, Downs resumes with Haydn, Mozart, adds some Beethoven, and then leads the transition into the nineteenth century.<br /><br />Despite the boring beginning, Downs' writing style is still very rigorous and scholarly.  He makes many references to the book's sister, the Norton Anthology of Classical Music, and provides the most in-depth analyses of the entire Norton Series.<br /><br />I feel bad giving the book three stars, but the other books by Atlas, Plantinga, Morgan and Hoppin are all better.  Reinhard Pauly's book is also out there, but it's shorter and I haven't read it.  Norton also published Charles Rosen's book Classical Style in 1999, which may be in response to this volume.<br /><br />I must say, however, that on information alone, this book is very good and can be a great reference.	2004-11-16

About half of the selections are from the big three (Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven), while the rest contains selections from composers such as CPE Bach, Clementi, Scarlatti, John Field, and others.<br /><br />There is no text and analysis of the pieces, just the music.  Downs does a good job of selecting different genres of pieces, from string quartets to symphonies to keyboard pieces.  The only complaint (not Downs' fault) is that some of the editions are awfully nasty to read, especially those of more obscure composers.  Hopefully one day some scholars will clean up those old editions.<br /><br />I suppose one can purchase this anthology without buying the book, but there's little point.  Unless there's something in here you can't find that you HAVE to have, you can get most of this music full-size for much less.	2004-11-16

Eventually, she is able to find love.  The rest of the story (and there are multiple subplots) is filled by the intricacies of the townspeople of Middlemarch.  Here you will wade through stories of gambling debs, family scandal, and various other estate affairs.<br /><br />If this sounds intriguing to you, then have at it.  Eliot is wonderful at Victorian prose, and although she was often criticized for being \\"depressing,\\" it's great stuff.  If you thought \\"Emma\\" or \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was a little slow, however, then it is likely you will not be impressed.<br /><br />The main problem I can see with a book like this is that there is something in it for everybody to complain about.  Victorian romance novel fans will complain that the book is not happy enough, and that Eliot doesn't talk enough about love.  Epic novel fans will complain that there isn't enough going on and some things are only hinted at.<br /><br />This book is notable in that Eliot was trying to write a much more serious novel than other women writers of the day, and in that she succeeded.  Readers who are interested in women writers should read this book, and it is important in the history of English literature.  I guess I wasn't able to see as much there as others could.	2004-11-05

I had seen this book in an airport bookstore, but wasn't sold until I saw Patton: the movie on TV and was entranced by George C. Scott's portrayal of the WWII General.<br /><br />General George S. Patton commanded the Third Army in Europe during WWII.  Although I had never realized it before, Patton really managed a giant corporation, an army of over 400,000 soldiers which built almost 2500 bridges, shipped over 2,000,000 tons of supplies, and inflicted hundreds of thousands of casualties on the enemy.<br /><br />After a short preface by George Steinbrenner (Red Sox fans will start on pg. 3), Axelrod begins with a short description of Patton's history and life philosophy.  Patton was certainly a fascinating character, with compelling qualities and outrageous flaws.<br /><br />The format of the book proceeds as follows: Axelrod uses a quote or anecdote from Patton's life to convey and support Patton's philosophy on leadership.  Although the subjects are grouped together (Chapter 3:Always attack. Never Surrender and Chapter 5:Speed-simplicity-boldness), the book does not refer back to any previous section.<br /><br />Fans of the movie will recognize many parts of the book, but those who know nothing about Patton will also find it an easy yet exciting read.  I found it to be quite valuable.<br /><br />This book is certainly not a whitewash of Patton's career, but Axelrod does a fantastic job of sifting through his life and finding the kernels of Patton's success.  I recommend this book to anybody interested in leadership (coaches), those in business, and those with an interest in military affairs.	2004-10-14

I own another Cambridge book about Haydn's Creation, which is also very good.<br /><br />Burrows begins with historical background of the Messiah, recounts the initial performances in Dublin, and then covers the revisions and revivals in London.  Other chapters cover later versions of Messiah (e.g. Mozart's orchestration), a short analysis of the overall design of the work, short comments on individual movements of interest, and Handel's word-setting.  There are also two appendices and a wonderful bibliography.<br /><br />Although brief and concise, the work is quite scholarly, containing many citations.  It is clear that Burrows knows his stuff regarding Handel and Messiah.<br /><br />My only disappointment with the book (and subsequent reason for four stars) is that many of Burrows' good points are buried within his scholarly prose and these gems are easy to overlook.  Despite this, I would recommend this book to anybody involved in a performance of Handel's Messiah, and it is a must for any conductor.  It provides a great deal of necessary background information in a concise manner, and is a great resource for program notes.	2004-09-15

Candide, the young illegitimate nephew of a German baron, is taught by his teacher/philosopher Pangloss that this world is \\"the best of all possible worlds.\\"  Candide falls in love with Cunegonde, the baron's young daughter.  When their love is discovered, Candide is expelled from his home, and the fun starts.  The entire novel is then consumed with tongue-in-cheek melodrama of Candide's worldwide attempt to find and marry Cunegonde, who is, of course, constantly on the move.<br /><br />Early on in the story we realize that the important aspects of Voltaire's novel are not the plot's details but the higher themes: the \\"real-world\\" tragedy which disproves Pangloss' initial optimistic teachings, the hypocrisy of the day's religious theologians, and the inability of money to solve problems.  Voltaire's wit shines in his masterpiece, and while this book is not for young children, it does have broad appeal, especially due to its short length.	2004-09-09

Although this sounds implausible at first, Dan Brown does a good job of establishing a logical progression.  The prose is simple and easy to follow, and since every chapter ends in a cliffhanger, it is difficult to put down.<br /><br />Some issues to be warned about-the plot of the book involves the Catholic Church and the Opus Dei movement.  Although Brown does not implicate the Church in evil activities, many critics knock the book for blurring the line between fact and terrific fiction.<br /><br />Second, the book is written in a simple prose and a cheap thriller style.  This is not an artsy book with themes about mermaids or man's inhumanity to man.<br /><br />Third, there are several facts which Brown gets wrong, such as the directions of Paris when describing the journey through the city.  Just as moviegoers suspend their disbelief when viewing a thrilling action flick, readers of the DaVinci Code must realize that they're in for a Hollywood-ized version of art history and religious symbolism.<br /><br />All that being said, this book deserves five stars for what it is: an entertaining, gripping novel that's easy to read and hard to put down.  If you're looking for more depth, or an analysis of religious history, then look elsewhere.	2004-09-09

Kinnick played halfback at the University of Iowa and won the Heisman Trophy in 1939.  He was also senior class president, a brilliant economics student, and later, a WWII Navy pilot.  Paul Baender has compiled Kinnick's diary and selected letters in the life of this extraordinary man.<br /><br />The first half of the book contains letters of Kinnick from his college days onward up through his Navy service.  Baender does his best to provide explanations and historical context either before or after each letter.  The book's second half contains Kinnick's diary, followed by Baender's explanations at the end.  My only complaint is that Baender would have provided some sort of conclusive end to the book.<br /><br />It is fascinating to read such wonderful prose from Kinnick's letters and diary.  College life and the game of football has certainly changed since 1939, but Kinnick's hopes, dreams and struggles are the same as we feel today.  He was not perfect, but I find it remarkable that Kinnick, a country boy from Iowa born long ago, recognized racial inequality in his domestic travels.<br /><br />Nile Clark Kinnick was killed in on a flight training mission during WWII, one of thousands of U.S. casualties.  The act of reading this compilation of Kinnick's writings has helped me see the personal courage, honor, and integrity with which thousands of veterans have served, and has helped illustrate the weight of the struggle in which we were engaged.  If you want to read about a great man, pick up this book.	2004-09-04

At 740+ pages, it certainly has a lot to say.  And since it's not a novel, there are clearly some sections I can say I liked better than others.  Yet even after reading the entire book, including authors preface explicitly describing GEB's meaning, I must still say I'm unsure exactly what the book is about.<br /><br />Hofstadter's thesis is an attempt to explain in a personal way how \\"animate beings can come out of inanimate matter.\\"  This quest begins mainly with an analysis of G&ouml;del's Theorem, which essentially states (please forgive me for any scientific inaccuracies) that it is impossible for any mathematical system to be complete.<br /><br />Hofstadter works us through this theorem rather slowly and gently, at first looking at simple, crude mathematical systems, and examining their successes and failures to depict our real number system.  Interspersed with this examination are fascinating dialogues between fictional characters.  These dialogues are at times odd, witty, clever, deep, philosophical, and are the icing of GEB.  Hofstadter also from time to time looks at the artwork of M.C. Escher and the music of J.S. Bach.  He notes the patterns found in their works and how they loop back on each other, or contain elements of self-reference, important to Hofstadter because it is this act of self-reference which makes G&ouml;del's Theorem possible.<br /><br />Hofstadter then gradually shifts from looking at mathematical systems and levels of systems to our own thought and our separate levels.  He examines cell structure and DNA, and moves outward to artificial intelligence and its relation to our intelligence.  This of course raises fascinating questions.  What do we think of when we think of the number \\"two?\\"  We certainly don't have a \\"10\\" in binary code sitting somewhere in our heads.  Hofstadter attempts to link these two realms of mathematical theory and intelligence theory and believes that intelligence is comprised of hierarchical levels, many independent and unconscious of levels above or below.<br /><br />Though written in 1979, this book covers ground which we have yet to traverse.  Although a computer can now beat the best human chess players, the world is seeking computers with more \\"intelligence.\\"  Where do thoughts come from?<br /><br />This book is not for those with a light interest in math or numbers.  Although you do not have to mathematically derive any of Hofstadter's proofs or understand everything (I didn't), it helps to be familiar with what Hofstadter is trying to say and to have an interest in puzzles, number, and the like.  Familiarity with Escher or Bach can help, but is not as requisite as the first.<br /><br />I am not a computer programmer, nor am I computer myself, so I have no idea whether Hofstadter's observations and assertions are true or false.  His book, however, I found very interesting and thought provoking, and quite rewarding.  I recommend this book to all those interested in math/computers, and for experts, it is probably required reading.d believes that intelligence is comprised of hierarchical levels, many independent and unconscious of levels above or below.   <br /> <br />Though written in 1979, this book covers ground which we have yet to traverse.

Miller has written several books on singing and voice teaching, and all of them have been generally well received.  This book is no exception.<br /><br />The questions are grouped in sections of subjects beginning with breath management.  Following chapters address posture, laryngeal functions, resonance, nasals and consonants, vibrato, registration, healthy singing, pedagogy issues, and performance concerns.  As one can see, this layout of the book ensures that while Miller does skip from question to question, the book does flow similarly to great treatises on singing and voice instruction.<br /><br />If one has never read a book by Richard Miller, one should know that his books can be technical and perhaps even...er, boring.  Miller has certainly taken great care that each question be answered thoroughly and accurately (not with a simple yes or no).  This is not the best book for a novice trying to learn about the voice.  Try books by Oren Brown or Clifton Ware first, or be prepared to look it up if you don't know exactly where the zygomatic muscles are or how the thyroid cartilage works.<br /><br />That being said, this book covers so many of the questions that people have about singing, even the questions that most voice teachers do not know.  Miller also includes a wonderful repertoire list for younger or beginning singers in the back, and his select bibliography is also as rigorous as I've seen anywhere else.  You may have to reread some answers, but it is clear that you are getting a well-researched answer.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to any voice teacher.  As long as they are prepared for technical answers, I think they will find it to be an invaluable resource.	2004-08-28

Shipwrecked and abandoned on a tropical island, Crusoe must find a way to survive. During his castaway adventures, Crusoe wrestles with God's fate and is challenged to answer the haunting question: is there somebody else on the island, or is he just going crazy?<br /><br />Despite the exciting premise, Robinson Crusoe is not really an 'exciting' novel. Indeed, each chapter title gives away the chapters' events. Moreover, Crusoe, who narrates his journey, is more concerned with describing the shape of the tiger's teeth, the nature of his growl, and various other details instead of building up any excitement about the encounter. Crusoe takes great pains describing how he counted all his objects and divided them up into equal segments.<br /><br />Another theme about the book is Crusoe's preoccupation with mastery. Crusoe is determined to dominate everything he comes in contact with. In fact, when teaching Friday English, he teaches him to call him \\"Master\\" before teaching him \\"yes\\" and \\"no.\\" In fact, Crusoe never refers to any other character by their name--very odd.<br /><br />Despite these peculiarities, Daniel Defoe has created a wonderful story and portrayed it with utmost detail. Defoe really thought about every aspect of human survival, and provides an uncanny amount of realism. If you like adventures, and don't mind long descriptions, then this book is perfect.	2004-07-19

While this is certainly true, I find that the books biggest drawback is its bland feel.  The book tries to speak to the new professor at Big University, U.S.A., but in trying to speak in general to everyone, it instead speaks to nobody.<br />The book is easy to read and is not too technical, and the price is fantastic.  I did not find as many specific tips on teaching as I had hoped, and some of the tips seemed obvious.<br />If you are a new college teacher (especially in the humanities area), this book can help you figure out some of the basics.	2004-07-16

The anthology contains 71 excerpts, all of which are referred to and explained in Hoppin's text.<br /><br />This anthology is not meant to stand alone-it would not be very effective for this purpose.<br /><br />Aside from the first excerpt, all the music is written in modern notation.  Hoppin explains some of the shortcoming of modern notation and makes it clear in the text why and how some of the examples don't really \\"fit\\" into our modern concept of musical notation.  That being said, the purpose of this anthology is for education, and it would be too challenging even for a graduate student to try to analyze such works using \\"old\\" notation.<br /><br />The anthology also gives English translations of the texts.  Although Hoppin wants the texts to come to life, I don't like how the translations aren't written next to the text.  In reading the text, I have to sort of guess where each section is being sung.  Since there is almost no word painting in medieval music, however, this isn't too much of a problem.<br /><br />One aspect about Norton's 20th Century Anthology was that there were concise analytical comments about each excerpt.  I found that to be extremely helpful, and wish this had the same.<br /><br />There really isn't too much more to say.  If you are reading Hoppin's book, get this anthology if you can-you'll be grateful.  If you're reading some other book on medieval music, then this book is worth knowing about.  Otherwise, I don't think this is the book for you.	2004-06-28

Hoppin's text proves to be scholarly yet interesting.<br />The first chapter is a fascinating historical introduction from the end of the Roman Empire up to 1000 A.D.  The second chapter then covers the history of the Christian liturgy through this time, which is also equally interesting.<br />Following chapters cover sacred music (Gregorian Chant, the music of the Offices/Mass, Embellishment of the liturgy, polyphony, and the Notre Dame School) and then switches over to secular music (trouveres, music outside France, and the motet).  The book then covers the later medieval period, including the Ars Nova in France, Machaut, the Italian Ars Nova, and even a section on English music.<br />If not already clear by the preceding paragraph, this text is not recommended for beginners at all.  I found many concepts in the book difficult  (especially some of the explanations on psalm tones and the \\"flex\\" as well as some of the Franconian or Italian mensuration), and I'm supposed to know this stuff.<br />As with most books in this series, a companion anthology of medieval music can also be purchased which I found quite helpful.  Hoppin refers to it often.  Another helpful book to have on hand would be a copy of the good old Liber usualis.  They're tough to find these days.<br />Other books on medieval music are by Jeremy Yudkin and there is a two-volume set written by Giulio Cattin and F. Alberto Gallo which has been recently translated.  I haven't read either, but they are the only ones I know of which might be this thorough.  Hoppin provides a good bibliography for each chapter, so experts can dig deeper.  A very good survey overall.	2004-06-28

McElheran states clearly that there is (or should be) little difference and that choral conductors should develop an orchestral technique.  While I would say that good choral and orchestral conducing are about 95 % similar (perhaps even more so), choral conductors should be aware that there are some differences, especially in ideas of always \\"hitting the imaginary table\\" or conducting every single beat.  Nonetheless, Conducting Technique can be very helpful for the beginning choral conductor.<br />Moreover, McElheran's writing style is very fresh and full of self-effacing wit.  Reading the book gives one the impression that Brock McElheran is the type of person who takes the art of music seriously but not himself seriously.  I think any beginner of conducting should consult this book, and even professionals might want to have it around just as a reference.	2004-06-26

Paragraphs are given for each show and can be found in chronological order of their opening nights.  Revivals are also discussed on their opening nights.<br />Despite the repetitive setup of the book's information, Bordman is able for the most part to write entertaining yet dense descriptions of the show's plot, hit songs, message, and overall run.  Although he spends more time on Musical Theatre's great hits (the biggest hits get a full page or two), some of Bordman's best writing moments come during his descriptions of some of Broadway's awful flops.<br />Other reviewers of this book criticize that Bordman has less to say about musicals since 1960.  I find this also to be true in some respects.  In Bordman's defense, this is in part due to the decline in Broadway's quality in the 1970s and 80s.  Bordman clearly comes from the camp of critics who feel that The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas and Cats, while popular, are not as artistically relevant as Oklahoma! and Show Boat.  Bordman is also no fanatic of Sondheim, as well, although he recognizes his lyric-writing genius.  For these reasons, the book gets four stars.<br />Having read the entire book, however, I must say that I know a lot more about American Musical Theatre than I did before, and probably know more by reading this book than by reading any other.  For libraries this book is a MUST have.  It's not cheap, but neither is any other 900-page hardcover book.  If you are looking for the ultimate reference on American Musical Theatre, this is it.	2004-06-21

I strongly recommend it.  The book can serve as a complete guide to voice training, especially for beginners.<br />Henderson begins with tips of caring for the voice correctly in speaking and singing.  There is also a chapter which introduces the parts of the body used in singing and how they function.  The main thrust of her training manual, however, is in posture, breathing, and resonance, the three most important areas of singing.<br />Henderson's manual here is quite instructional and practical, often with pictures of both right and wrong methods.  Some pictures can be very helpful, as many singers are unaware of what it looks like when someone is singing with their mask in the proper shape.<br />In her section on developing correct resonance and tone, Henderson provides a slew of short vocal exercises, perhaps even too many in my opinion.  The latter sections incorporate the previous chapters' information into singing a vocal song, performance techniques, choral techniques, and cases of vocal abuse.<br />In addition to the metal spiral-bound soft-cover book, there is also a short cassette tape which records the exercises.  This may be helpful, but I found the book descriptions of the exercises to be sufficient.<br />Other great books on singing are by Clifton Ware, Oren Brown, Richard Miller, Richard Alderson, and James McKinney.  Henderson's book can be a valuable resource to any voice teacher.	2004-06-21

After reading the entire book, I can say that while not perfect, it is very well written and thought provoking.<br />Loewen's main thesis is that American History textbooks (mostly for high school courses) are often bland, boring, and sometimes just plain wrong.  Textbooks do this for the sake of convenience and to avoid discussing issues which would make America or individuals look bad.  Loewen examines twelve American History textbooks commonly used and discusses passages which avoid the facts, gloss over them, or sometimes state an outright lie.<br />The first chapter starts with Helen Keller and Woodrow Wilson.  Who knew that Wilson was against women's suffrage, that he was a staunch racist, and that he sent troops to fight in the eastern Soviet Union and Mexico?  Loewen also discusses Helen Keller's adulthood as a socialist.<br />Loewen supports his facts with copious endnotes from numerous sources.  Although some sources seem to be more credible and mainstream than others, it is clear that Loewen's statements are well bolstered and are based on rigorous scholarship.<br />Other chapters cover Christopher Columbus, the first Thanksgiving, the treatment of Native Americans/American Indians by white \\"settlers,\\" racism in America, the unknown actions of the federal government, and Vietnam.  The final two chapters also discuss why history is taught this way and how to change it.<br />Some reviewers have criticized the author for liberal bias in his book.  After reading the later chapters, I do agree that some liberal bias exists.  Loewen certainly does not have much positive to say about Vietnam, Barry Goldwater, or Ronald Reagan.  I also feel that some of Loewen's phrasing about Vietnam (written back in 1995) is coincidentally similar to some phrasing used by some liberals today regarding Iraq, which is also a reason why strong conservatives may find LMTTM to be subconsciously distasteful.<br />The real problem with LMTTM is that Loewen's version of the truth is not perfect (to his credit, Loewen is gracious enough to admit this in his book).  Loewen's defense of John Brown as a sane man willing to die for his beliefs could be easily misused by a fanatic who wished to bomb an abortion clinic.  And how far should history books go in advertising the tragic flaws of our heroes?  If high school students only remember the sensationalist stories from history, they will remember only that Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, that Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy committed adultery, and that Charles Lindbergh was a Nazi sympathizer.<br />All that being said, Loewen's thesis overall is correct, and he presents it clearly and factually in a way that is thought provoking and easy to read.  Perhaps if we teach the whole truth about history, we may find some uncomfortable spots, but we will have a history we can really be proud of.  I recommend this book to all but the staunchest Republicans.

Of course everybody wants to look nice, but isn't it complicated to know how to look good?<br />That's where I found this book to be especially helpful.  Flusser's main point is that most of the elements of good style haven't really changed much at all in the last 75 years or so.  Flusser asserts that the main goal of men's attire is to frame the body in order to display the man's face.<br />A great aspect about the book is that you only need to remember the &quot;rules&quot; for your specific skin tone/height/proportions.  For instance, a man with gray/silver hair should wear silver/gray in his attire to properly frame his face, etc.  Flusser also is very clear about how clothes should properly fit you, which is helpful when you are trying things on.<br />The illustrations and photographs (both new and classic) are remarkably well done and effectively portray Flusser's points (both good and bad examples).  Other reviews here have pointed out some of the &quot;doctoring&quot; of the photos in some instances.  I do see evidence of this, but I do not think it is really a substantive beef of the book.<br />Flusser's book certainly has some shortcomings.  It mainly focuses on the men's suit and typical business dress.  Although it does have a chapter on more casual dress (and the formal tuxedo), it is a small part of the book.<br />This is a great book for the man who wants to look nice.  It covers a lot of details, from tying a tie properly to folding a handkerchief to wearing a tie clip.  It's probably not for you if you wear jeans to work every day and only wear a suit two times a year.	2004-05-07
US	51038699	R1C8TE00V90W2U	0877860009	387904230	Hints on singing	Books	2	2	9	N	N	Not good at all for learning how to sing	Published in 1894, this guide has been easily surpassed by a good deal of literature on vocal pedagogy written in the 20th century.<br />Although it was probably helpful in its day, much of what it teaches is not effective, and some is downright wrong.  In order to make sure a singer keeps their chin back, the book suggests pinning a band of paper around the neck and in front of the chin.  Several other &quot;hints&quot; also seem to be ineffective or harmful to the voice.<br />What's more, much of the book is taught in the silly old style of question/answer.  For example:<br />&quot;Q.  While the faults of emission are mending is there any other study to be pursued?<br />A.  The acquirement of agility.<br />Q.  How is this to be obtained?<br />A.  By the study of diatonic scales, passages of combined intervals, arpeggios, chromatic scales, turns, shakes, light and shade.<br />Q.  How long will this study take?<br />A.  Not less than two years.&quot;<br />And so on.  Modern books on vocal pedagogy put this book in their lengthy bibliographies, and you will probably want to read this book if you are working on a dissertation of vocal ped. history.  Perhaps professional singers could benefit from this book, provided they knew enough to know what parts of the book to ignore.  Otherwise, stick to the books by Richard Miller, Clifton Ware, Larra Henderson, and the like.	2004-05-05

At first I thought the title was rather unexciting, and that this may be a dull, uninformative book.  This has proved to be very incorrect.<br />Thurmond's main point is that musicians can be taught to play/sing expressively, specifically with respect to rhythm.<br />Most amateur musicians have a tendency to play to the downbeat too forcefully and the preceding upbeat without proper emphasis, Thurmond theorizes.  This postulate slowly is applied to larger and larger parts of the music, from the inner pulse to the common beat, back again to strong and weak measures, and even perhaps on a larger scale.  In some ways it resembles a &quot;Shenkerian&quot; approach to rhythm.<br />Although this theory may sound confusing at first, Thurmond restates and clarifies each element with such incremental precision that it is relatively simple to follow.<br />Amateur musicians as well as professionals can benefit from this book, provided that the reader is able to read music and knows the difference between a downbeat and an upbeat (of course this disqualifies all trombone players--Just kidding).  You will enjoy the insights in this book!	2004-05-02

That said, Witherspoon's text does have some value, and surprisingly, much of what he says certainly holds up today.<br />Witherspoon was an American bass who sang in the Metropolitan Opera.  This book mainly focuses on the proper way to sing.  Witherspoon's main points are as follows:<br />1) More nonsense has been written about singing and breathing than about anything else.  Teachers tell their students to &quot;feel the voice&quot; in all various parts of their body, or are consistently told to &quot;relax.&quot;  These instructions only confuse the student.  This is still common today<br />2) All vocal problems are due to a lack of proper coordination in breathing or coordination in pronunciation.  Witherspoon's solutions are therefore coordinated breathing and phonetic singing exercises, of which he has several troubleshooting charts and sample exercises.<br />I think this book deserves about 3 1/2 stars.  There are other books written about singing in the last 80 years (!) that are more complete and applicable to today than this one.  I am not in complete agreement with his emphasis on &quot;middle&quot; breathing rather than &quot;low AND middle&quot; breathing, and also think that the typical voice student of 1925 is much different than today's typical voice student.<br />If you only want to read one or two books on singing, then this is definitely not one for you.  If you are a serious student/teacher and you plan to be reading many books on singing, I think you will find this one to be a helpful compliment to other books.	2004-04-18

This text is great for people who want to learn about music history in Western society (Western Europe and some of America).<br />Beginning with a chapter on the elements and aspects of music, the book starts with Gregorian Chant (c. 400) and quickly moves through history all the way to 20th century music, including minimalism and Arvo Part.<br />The reading is clear and straightforward, and the pictures and charts make the reading more exciting than your typical bland textbook.  There are some problems, however.<br />First, this book is not adequate for music majors.  As another reviewer states, many great composers here are overlooked or briefly mentioned, especially those composers who were not on the leading edge of each movement (e.g. William Byrd, Sergei Rachmaninov, Gustav Holst, Bruckner, Wolf, and Prokofiev).<br />Another issue that some have with the book is its inclusion of women composers into history.  I understand why they do it.  Even today in society there are few women composers, and it is important to teach our young women that they can write great music.  On the other hand,  as a result of poor musical education and opportunities, compositions of women composers such as Jacquet de la Guerre and Barbara Strozzi pale in comparison with those of Mozart, Bach, and Beethoven.  This emphasis of women composers is one that is constantly undergoing debate in the music world.<br />If you are looking for a Music Appreciation textbook, I would strongly consider this one as well as Roger Kamien's text.  If you are not taking a class and just want to learn about music, you should consider getting the 8-CD set of musical excerpts.  They go along with the listening guides in the book, and help illustrate the textbook's concepts.	2004-04-15

It was a very entertaining read and certainly worth the price, but a couple \\"bewares.\\"<br />This book was published in 1980.  I had forgotten just how much things have changed in the consumer world since then.  And it's not just things like information on the Internet and email addresses.  Lemon laws regarding used cars have changed some things, and the books section on airline travel is quite outdated.  The section on telephones is also a laugher.  For this reason, I am unable to give it five stars.<br />But there are some helpful tips which will save you money on several fronts:  from buying a car (by a car at the end of the month, as salesman are up against sales quotas) to buying a house (get an energy audit), to shopping at the supermarket (a chart on when fruits and vegetables are the freshest and cheapest) and Health, Cosmetics, and Drugs (a lot of rip-offs here).<br />Stossel's prose is just as entertaining in this early consumer guide book.  I think he would be quite surprised to know that people are still reading this book today.  If you find this book used, it's certainly worth the money.	2004-04-10

Books	5	126	137	N	N	Well,  I love this book	The reviews here are all pretty much one way or another.  Most readers seem to like Science and Health, while many others have some strong negative comments/reviews.  It should be addressed here, however, that many reviews are about the Christian Science Church rather than the book itself.<br /><br />Some individuals have had negative experiences with the Church/religion, and while their experiences are certainly valid,  I am not about to defend the shortcomings of a human institution in this space.  I do feel the need, however, to distinguish between a religion and its book.  People, for example, may have had problems with the Catholic faith in their life, but that's no reason to start bashing the Bible or giving it a one-star rating.<br /><br />What few seem to discuss here is the book's central thesis, that God exists and that His divine laws should be directly applicable to us in our daily lives.  I personally happen to agree with this statement, but I can also understand why some out there would disagree.  Maybe they don't believe in God, or don't believe in Jesus' teachings.  Maybe they don't think that God can affect their daily lives.<br /><br />There are 100 pages of testimonials of people who were healed of various ailments from reading this book.

That said, Kagen does have some good things to say about the importance of developing your inner ear and not getting bogged down by too much technical twaddle.
