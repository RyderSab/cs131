I get the bonus of a well-written, fun, and fast-paced read. <br /> <br />This book is perfect for preschoolers who like to dress them selves. As the child in the book puts on each article of clothing for a day in the snow, she says 'hello' to the clothing and 'goodbye' to something else. Here is an excerpt to illustrate: <br /> <br />\\"Hello, pants. <br />Goodbye, knees. <br />I don't want  <br />you guys to freeze. <br /> <br />Hello, sock. <br />Goodbye, toe. <br />Hold on piggies-- <br />In you go!\\" <br /> <br />The action heads outdoors, for even more fun with a snowman and sledding and fun with friends. <br /> <br />A perfect read for cold winter days! <br />	2004-10-12

I collect children's Christmas books and this is a new favorite in my collection. I have many books that recount the manger story, but this one stands out. The artist, Deborah Perez-Stable, chose to depict children in a Christmas pageant representing all of Bethleham's finest folk. The result is heartfelt. Not only that, but Chaconas' rhyming text sings with a beauty all its own.	2004-09-30

If you are familiar with the work of Mary Ann Hoberman, you know her books are top-notch. If you are REALLY familiar with her work, you will recall seeing the text of this book back in the early 70's. This remake is fabulous! Husliska-Beith has added the color and whimsy that the original version lacked in illustration, making it something special for today's child. <br />The book is an interactive experience. The child is encouraged to join in on the search for Pistachio the cat. His owner, Ned, is looking on every page and needs your help. With clever lines...\\"Of course you know it's not much fun/<BR>to lose a cat upon page ONE...And so he started out to look/straight through the pages of this book.\\" <br />There is also plenty for the eye (perhaps why it is called THE LOOKING BOOK?:-) Huliska-Beith has added lots of funny details which should keep you and your child entertained.

I won't go into plot much because the above reviewer has covered that well enouh.  The book is told from three seperate points of view. The first, an unlikable 8th grader named Janine. The second, Eric, a boy in a leg cast who has been away at school for three years and now finds himself in public school with kids he has lived near but doesn't know. The third voice is used sparingly. It is an omniscient voice that opens each chapter and at first, I found myself confused (but intrigued) trying to guess what this was all about. The omniscient POV is used rarely and each time it is used, you seem to peeking ahead to a final conclusion. I liked it as a plot device. I also liked how the author was able to take this mean and nasty little girl and make me care about her--that is a difficult task. Well done!	2000-11-19

So, a week before Christmas, like any good shopper, he heads to town to look for a suit. The stores he visits have clever names like 'Nip and Tux' (a tuxedo shop) and 'Costumania'. When Santa arrives back at the North Pole in his new suit, the elves, the reindeer and even Mrs. Santa cannot believe their eyes! Ms. Rader employs the use of speech bubbles to show the surpised, often comic, reaction of her characters. Needless to say, all turns out well in the end and the last page of the book is a satisfying conclusion to the story. a great addition to any kids' (or adult's) Holiday collection.	2000-11-19

The art in this book resembles that of badly drawn comic books. It is loud, ugly, and unappealing. (In one scene Sophie's head is bent at an unatural angle  giving the appearance that it is detached from her body. Yuck!) If the text  were good, I could forgive all this. But when little Sophie gets angry she  has a temper tantrum then runs away. There is nothing new or special here.

First off, she tries to be cool/clever by giving all her  characters these really strange names. Ex: Weetzie, Duck, Secret Agent  Lover Man (I am not making this up. That is the real name of a character)  Then, she tries to be real hip by putting in stuff that no teenager I KNOW  would do. (Weetzie moves in with her friend Dirk who is gay. They drink and  party at night clubs and even when two more weird people move in, they seem  to have endless amounts of money, but no one seems to have a job?  Plus  they all have this creepy relationship that I don't EVEN want to go into!)  I read the entire book while having tires put on my car (11/2 hours) I have  no idea what the author was trying to say. The only 'theme' I could see  running through the book was: It doesn't matter how deplorable your  lifestyle is, because you WILL live happily ever after--without a job!	1999-12-17
