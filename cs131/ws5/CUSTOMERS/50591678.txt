Hopgood\\", and \\"The Haunting of Hiram\\" are all the same story by the same author. Just a different title and different cover art, same book inside. This is not the author's fault by the way, it is just that 2 publishers have the right to publish, Puffin and Macmillan, and this is what they have done. For some reason that is done with another book from this author, \\"Island of the Aunts\\" is also released as \\"Monster Mission\\". Personally, I like the artwork on the Macmillan covers from England better.<br /><br />On to the story - This is a book about a rich Texan that buys a Scottish Castle named Carra from the last heir of an old family, an orphan boy. But he does not want any ghosts included as he is worried that they will scare the little girl that will live in the castle.  The millionaire ships the whole thing stone by stone and rebuilds it in Texas. But the castle does have ghosts, very nice ones who have helped raise the boy. They include a viking, a ghost dog, and Miss Spinks. What the millionaire does not notice is that the ghosts do come with the castle. The boy flies to America to get the ghosts out and stays in the castle. When they learn they cannot stay, they move into an old movie theater next door, where they meet the mysterious ghost hand. Somehow, he is trying to solve the mystery of his murder many years ago. And when the little girl is kidnapped for ransom, the ghosts must join the effort to rescue her and the boy.<br /><br />This book is suspenseful, but laugh-out-loud hilarious. The author creates the most charming and imaginative characters you can imagine. I strongly reccommend!	2005-10-11

The book is spiral bound, with a net and camouflage cover, and a functional compass attached to the cover. The book has an index and table of contents, artwork and color photos.  It also lists a few useful addresses like the Red Cross, FEMA, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and more. The style of the book is very busy, short and to the point on the issues, so it might be more likely to be read by some youths. Most of the advice in the book is very good up to date information, even in its abbreviated form.<br /><br />The book breaks down survival issues into 4 areas starting with \\"Animal Dangers\\", with advice about bears, snakebite, gators, cougars, ants, bees, and sharks. The information on animals is very good because it advises you how to avoid the problem in the first place, as well as good advice on what to do if an encounter happens. Next is \\"Natural Dangers\\" including quicksand, hurricane, earthquake, avalanche, lightening, tornado, blizzard, desert heat, sea, flood, forest fire, and frozen wilderness.  This section is very good as well, useful advice. Third is \\"Human Hazards\\", including escape from a car in the water, avoid being crushed in a crowd, survive a plane crash, escape a burning building, escape a sinking ship, and creating a family fire safety plan. This chapter again has very solid advice. Last chapter is \\"Basic Survival Skills\\", including planning, navigation, pocketknife use, finding water, making fire, finding food, storing and cooking food, making shelter, animals in the wild, time, weather, getting rescued, getting out, first aid, and knots.<br /><br /> I do have a few minor complaints with the last section, as some areas are way too brief, even for a book aimed at kids. After all, if a person is buying this book, the biggest reason they may need it is for emergency skills when camping. It seems that this chapter should have had more information, but is slim on some very important points. The first aid section covers blisters, burns, and how to sling a broken arm. That's it, nothing on choking, bleeding, or other hazards. Kids can learn this stuff, we teach 9 year old Cub Scouts. In the section on planning, there is no mention of the \\"buddy system\\", especially vital for kids. Another glitch, the book correctly tells you to purify all drinking water you find, yet on the same page has a picture of a hiker drinking water right out of a stream. This is a mixed message, as drinking directly from a stream is very dangerous.<br /><br />Another topic that needs some work is the one on getting lost.  When we teach kids about getting lost we always tell them that as soon as you are lost, stay put or \\"hug a tree\\" as we call it. It is much easier and quicker to find a lost kid if they stay in one place. The more they panic and keep walking or running, the longer the rescue takes. This book says you have to decide whether to stay put or try to get out. There is no decision to make as a kid, statistically if you stay put you will get found, but maybe not at all if you keep moving.<br /><br />Overall a very interesting book, lots of good stuff. Make sure you cover the missing points or mistakes with your kids though.st aid section covers blisters, burns, and how to sling a broken arm.

This was accomplished through the creation of rigourous hiring standards coupled with a training program known as the Disney University, created by the author of this book, Van Arsdale France. The book is his candid autobiography, written in a warm conversational tone, and is very enjoyable based on his 35 years of working at Disneyland.  He was working for Disneyland while it was still under construction, and stayed there until his retirement in 1990. He passed away in 1999. Here was a man that truly loved Disneyland and the dream that it's founder Walt Disney wanted it to represent. Van was there in the early days, and he includes fascinating stories and pictures you won't find anywhere else about interesting events that occurred at Disneyland over the years.<br /><br />The title, \\"Window on Main Street\\" refers to the tradition of placing the names of persons who have made a big contribution to the success of Disneyland on the upper story windows on Main Street USA in Disneyland. The names include the famous composers the Sherman Brothers, imagineers like Marc Davis, or X. Atencio, and animators like Ward Kimball. Van has a picture of each of the windows, and what the person was honored for.<br /><br />The book includes fascinating stories of \\"Backstage Disneyland\\", to give you a better understanding of what makes the park hum along on a daily basis. IT is loaded with pictures you will not see in any other book. I have thoroughly enjoyed the tons of fascinating and insightful stories and pictures in this book, about incidents, staff, management, and attractions at the park.<br /><br />Includes a forward by Dick Nunis, former president of Walt Disney Theme Parks Division. Published in 1991 by \\"Laughter Publications\\", a company that used to publish a well made Disneyana magazine called, \\"The Art of Laughter\\". This book is hard to find, as it is out of print.

It was the work they provided for the soldiers, sailors, and airmen of World War II.  The studio animators under Walt's direction provided free of charge the design of over 1,000 original artistic logos for the armed forces. These were used on individual planes, tanks, and ships for their crews. They also helped design unit insignias for organized armoured units, air wings and squadrons, infantry units and others. These requests were sometimes funneled through the official military channels, but more often came in a letter sent from overseas signed by a bunch of American young men. Most often the boys would send in a rough sketch of what they had in mind, or asked to use a certain animated character they favored. Other times they let the studio come up with whatever they wanted, and the artists often created new characters on the spot. No request was too big or too small, the animators completed every job. These designs were incredible and inspiring works of art, not something dashed off in a hurry.<br /><br />This effort began when early one morning a fews days after the bombing of Pearl Harbour, the phone rang at Walt Disney's house. The Studio called to tell him that 700 army troops had set up camp at the Walt Disney studio campus, in order to protect the nearby airfield. The long war hurt the Disney company many way, including the loss of key staff to the armed forces, reduction in commercial output and attendance, and cuts in overseas theatrical releases of their films. Despite these issues that could have caused resentment of the wars interference in Disney growth and success, the company dove in to do their part to support the war effort.<br /><br />Whether it was in producing great war time comedy animated shorts such as \\"Der Fuhreres Face\\" to keep up the public morale; or educational films to teach soldiers how to operate a certain weapon or avoid disease; or deeply researched theory films like \\"Victory Through Airpower\\"; or animated shorts that promoted war bonds... the studio worked overtime to do their part. The logos and unit insignia are a big part of that effort.<br /><br />The beautiful color photos reproduce the actual designs in page after page of color photos. A wonderful book for the Disneyphile, OR for those that are just interested in high quality unit design artwork from planes, etc. from WWII.<br /><br />Also see the book \\"Donald Duck Joins Up: The Walt Disney Studio During World War II (Studies in Cinema)\\" to get a more complete picture of all the other combined efforts of the studio during the war, including the logos in this book. In order to see the logos themselves, the book on this page features more of them than any other book.ilms to teach soldiers how to operate a certain weapon or avoid disease; or deeply researched theory films like \\"Victory Through Airpower\\"; or animated shorts that promoted war bonds... the studio worked overtime to do their part.

The recipes were contributed by forest rangers that work in diffuicult back country areas that have the \\"wilderness\\" designation. This means no vehicles allowed, even for rangers. So all food is packed in, and they live like any other backpacker. Because they spend more time doing this than recreational backapckers, they have learned to be pretty creative with backpack food off the shelf, or making their own. Fun easy to prepare recipes, from some fun and very intelligent people. Also has map showing just where the wilderness areas are in this country.<br /><br />But, if you are looking for for more traditional camp cooking, even stuff you can make at home instead of backing food, I reccommend the book by the National Museum Of Forest Service History \\"Camp Cooking: 100 Years\\". It is sold here at Amazon.	2005-08-31

A fictional story, it starts with a summer job as fire lookout for Phil Mallory, who is fresh out of high school. The lookout tower is boring as he stares with binoculars at mountainsides hour after agonizing hour for weeks looking for a puff of smoke. Other areas of the forest have plenty of action and he is dying to join the crew fighting a regional fire, but nothing seems to happen for Phil. He longs for a fire to start in his area so he can be a hero and put it out himself. When a  fire starts, forgets much of what he learned about fire fighting. After his inexperiance makes things worse, he realizes you should be careful what you wish for. In the long run he has rewarding experiances and learns valuable lessons about following the rules and sticking to training. The very enjoyable live action Disney movie, \\"Fire on Kelly Mountain\\" was adapted from this book.	2005-08-31

So it is filled with historic stories and photos of early ranger camps and cooks. Some of these vintage recipes have been around for awhile, and are very nostalgic. Most recipes list the contributing ranger, and their district.  Spiral binding makes it easy to cook with, as you can keep the book open and flat on the page you need. All cookbooks should be made like that.<br /><br />Most of these dishes are for cooking on a cabin stove or fire. The recipes rely on heavier fresh, dry, or canned ingredients similar to what you have at home. So any of these recipes can be made in your own kitchen, but are also good for RV and car camping. Starts with dutch oven cooking basics. Has chapters on breads, breakfasts, veggies, main dishes, and desert. Has an index. This book was released in 2004. It is 192 pages in length.<br /><br />For a look at modern Ranger cooking see \\"Wilderness Ranger Cookbook\\", which is a modern ultra-light backpacking recipes cookbook from backcountry Forest Service Wilderness Rangers all across America.

The majority of the book tells what Walt's life as a child was like. The publisher has produced a whole series of bio type books for young people, and has a good formula. They try to put the child in touch not only with the life deeds of the man, but his personality, and how he got his start. In understanding a great person from history, it is tremendously useful to know not just what he did, but why he did it. Who and what influenced this person. What was he like as a kid himself? Without these it is hard for a kid to connect to the historical figure, and this book accomplishes it very well. I highly reccommend! For a good adult bio, check the Bob Thomas book, or the Amy Boothe book.	2005-08-29

It is fairly accurate, from a reliable publisher. If you have a child that is younger than this age group, I might suggest \\"Walt Disney, Young Movie Maker\\". It focuses more on his childhood, explaining how the events, persons, and places he lived when he was young affected his career as an adult. It really helps kids connect with this man that had such a huge impact on family entertainment.	2005-08-29

The book trots out some old negative rumors without citing their sources.  No source documentation or supporting material is included to support the wild tale about cryogenics. There is a story about an attempted suicide that never occurred and the book seems to tie it time-wise to the well documented nervous breakdown that Walt had at that same age. Big difference.<br /><br />If you like books that bash famous people just for the sake of doing it, you may enjoy this. But for historic accuracy I prefer to read a bio that is neither sugar-coated or harsh.  The Bob Thomas biography is considered by many to be the most accurate and complete available, and he also wrote a bio of Roy Disney (Walt's business partner and brother. In Thomas's case he carefully documents and quotes all of his sources, Then he confirms that person's version with others and quotes them as well. Some animators and studio employees have their own bio books that include some of their personal interactions with Walt Disney, like Shamus Culhane, Charles Show, Bill Peet, Ub Iwerks, or Harry Tytle. They have personal interactions to share including some negative ones and their stories match. I can recommend a book about his personal philosophies he used in life in his own words, \\"Quotable Walt Disney\\", tracks over 30 years of his comments on just about everything. You can tell a lot about a person with their own words.  Walt Disney's family has always maintained he was a loving husband, and father.  In summary, this book should be classified as fiction, and not a biography.	2005-08-29

He may have spent more behind the scenes time with Walt than perhaps anyone else, sitting quitly in the background in meeting after meeting. He comes across very straight forward and honest. Some books about Walt Disney are by people that simply bash him after he is gone in order to push book sales, or suggest weird speculations about him. This book does not do that, nor does it sugarcoat everything either and Walt comes across as a human being like everyone else. Charles Shows just tells it like it is.<br /><br />I found this to be a very interesting book, both about Disney and the job of being a publicist. I reccommend you track it down. If you are interested in another book by someone who personally spent significant time with Walt at the studio, try the book by Harry Tytle titled \\"One of Walt's Boys\\" published in 1997. Tytle was a studio manager/administrator and film producer who spent considerable personal time with Walt. It is a bit hard to track down though.	2005-08-29

Remember when you used to get in trouble for doodling in the margin as a kid, well we still do it now at work or while on the phone. Well, I do... Anyway it turns out that those simple little sketches and scribbles are big stuff now. Someone decided that it releases some sort of brain mumbo-jumbo and makles your thinking more creative. Whatever, I still think it's fun. Doodles are the first step to better art skills. This book helps you refine your doodles so they look better when someone else finds them.  Also try the Ed Emberly books, \\"Make a World\\", and \\"The Big Green Drawing Book\\".	2005-08-27

The recipes are easily modified for larger groups if neccessary. If you need to cook for smaller groups than this, there is another book made by BSA for cooking that sells here at Amazon, it has everything you need to know if you have no outdoor cooking skills at all, or no cooking skills period. It is called \\"Cooking, Merit Badge Series\\".<br /><br />The book on this page assumes you have some basic outdoor cooking skills. After a really good chapter on planning, shopping, measurements, number of servings, it has a chapter on cooking equipment, pots, pans, etc.  It has very limited information on fires or stoves, but jumps into a ton of really good fail-free simple recipes. This is down home camp cooking, none of that foo-foo outdoor gourmet stuff here. Fried chicken, pot roast, sloppy joes, goulash, stews, chicken & dumplings, burgers, stewed chicken, roast chicken, spaghetti, ham dinner, beans, pigs in the blanket, stuff that hungry boys love. It has side dishes, breads, and beverages. It has a great chapter on breakfast, one of the most importatn meals in the woods. And most important, to the hungry kids, is the desert... brownies, peach cobbler, doughnut balls, apple pudding, pineapple upside down cake, fried apples, and more. All in all a great book for groups, or big families. I highly reccommend.	2005-08-26

If you have no outdoor cooking skills at all, or heck if you just have no cooking skills period - this book will help you get started.

In 1768 Captain Cook set about in the ship Endeavor for a secret mission, the first of his 3 historic journeys to chart new lands around the world, chart the stars, and discover new species of plants and wildlife. Joining the able crew was a small group of scientific gentlemen or \\"naturalists\\" and their servants, broken into various specialties such as botany, zoology, and astronomy. Little did the Captain know that a stowaway was on board - 11 year old Nicholas was running from a brutal apprenticeship into the only place he could think of, the adventure of the sea. Lucky for young Nick the Captain is not brutal like many others, but he does run a tight, disciplined ship. Nick is put to work, and he works hard. He receives valuable training in several areas in addition to sailor skills, he helps the ships medical officers, and the naturalists. Because Nick has a very curious mind and an eager nature, he is made a formal part of the crew and allowed to draw pay like any other seaman aboard. There is plenty of excitement with the ship's crew facing disease, storms, strange natives, and uncharted islands. A midshipman named Mr. Bootie decides it is his job to try to get Nick in trouble or be cruel to him, to the point that he is a danger to Nick's life.<br /><br />We the reader join the story through Nick's eyes, as we are reading his journal. He makes an entry almost every day for the 2 years that they are at sea, and through his journal we also observe his growth into a sharp eyed young man that is very likable and gains the respect of his shipmates. It is a dramatized piece of history by the Newberry award winning writer. The author combed the actual records on the real life voyage of the Endeavor, in order to make the book as factual as possible. The nautical dialogue is accurate, but includes a glossary in the back to look up terms you do not understand. There is a list of the ships crew, and a map of the journey to follow as well. There are some illustration in the book, and the outer wrap-around cover of the book is very nice, and is based on a real seventeenth-century original.<br /><br />One of the interesting impacts this book has on young people, is it leads them to want to learn more about history and they want to go to the library or other sources to learn more about Captain Cook's explorations. The book is suitable for readers age 10 and up, but any younger reader that wants to tackle it should by all means. As an adult that borrowed the book from my son for a plane trip, I too thoroughly enjoyed this interesting story. If your young reader enjoyed this, they may like to read \\"Carry on, Mr. Bowditch\\", or \\"The Dark Frigate\\".the book, and the outer wrap-around cover of the book is very nice, and is based on a real seventeenth-century original. <br /> <br />One of the interesting impacts this book has on young people, is it leads them to want to learn more about history and they want to go to the library or other sources to learn more about Captain Cook's explorations.

He worked closely with the top animators and has wonderful stories to tell about them, his time at the studio, and of course Walt. Like many animators, not all of his memories are good, but he does not get carried away. The real treat is the many drawings and caricatures he made of life at the studio while he worked there, in addition to drawings from his other co-workers such as Ward Kimball and Fred Moore.

He fights for his freedom and becomes a leader.<br /><br />When I was a kid, my dad introduced me on to the rollicking science fiction he had read when he was young himself. Robert Heinlen, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Andre Norton... In the same vein this is a good adventure yarn of a stranger lost in another land.<br /><br />The author is well known for his great teen survival stories (like Hatchet) and western adventures, has written a new teen adventure in the genre that I grew up with and miss so much.

It is a fun and simple to read narrative on the who, how, and why of Disney music for film and television. So many interesting questions are addressed here: Why did they choose the song April Showers for Bambi? Who were the staff composers, and who were the composers on contract. What did each of them contribute? What awards did they and the studio receive? Do you want to know how and why the word \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" was used?<br /><br />Music was so critical to Disney that entire short films and animation were written around them such as Fantasia and Silly Symphonies. There is plenty of insight on the genius of Walt here. The book has many incidents of his direct involvement in guiding the composers to write, adapt, and change their music to the vision he had for a project. This is where a lot of the \\"why\\" come in. Great personal stories and anecdotes. Covering the period from the very beginning up to the time the late 1980's when the book was written. Nice material and on the Sherman Brothers, they even wrote the introduction.  Pictures on every page, many for the first time. While this book is more about the story behind the music, it is also a good reference guide as well. A nice 11 inch tall book, hardcover with a dust jacket, 158 pages, great searchable index, published in 1991, and has not been updated since to my knowledge. If you are looking for a reference guide to Disney on vinyl records, try \\"The Golden Age of Walt Disney Records\\", also at Amazon.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book, great reading and reference, I highly recommend.	2005-08-19

It is very short in length, about the size and length of a coloring book compared to the huge original Mark Kistler books, like \\"Draw Squad\\".<br /><br />Mark shows you how to draw in in three dimensions so your art looks better. Space ships robots, and other inventions galore! His way of teaching is simply the easiest method a person can have to start drawing. Along the way you are learning perspective, shading, and other drawing tools without making these seem like tough concepts.<br /><br />If you are looking for some fun stuff to draw, and the books you have seen before only seem to make it harder, your search is over. Mark's step by step method makes it easy for anyone at any age to get some basic drawing skills. You may want to try his big book \\"Draw Squad\\" before this one if you haven't yet... This one is for someone that has his other books already. And if his books are good, his old show on PBS and his videos are even better.  He does not start by intimidating you with the completed project, in fact you don't always know what you are drawing until you are done. He takes you one line, circle, or square at a time and before you know it you have a fun completed drawing. I also reccommend you try the books from Ed Emberly, or check my lists on Amazon for kids that want to learn to draw, or be a cartoonist or animator.	2005-08-10

He was right of course, his trip was one of the last and we are lucky today that someone had the foresight to preserve this information for the history books. The real business of whaling was for the oil taken from the whales blubber. The newly introduced practice of pumping petroleum oil from underground quickly made whaling a costly alternative instead of the prime source. This is the author's first hand account of whaling men and methods in the early 1900's. Fascinating stuff.	2005-08-09

It is about kids of pirates that go to school every day just like toehr kids, only they go in a school bus painted row boat to a giant pirate ship/public school. The lessons they teach are backwards to our own morals and not fair, as the kids are to be greedy and not share, and worse yet to fight when they have disputes. But these rules dont work when it is treasure hunt day on the spooky island. Although each boy claims to have found the treasure first, they quickly learn tha if they are to survice, they must ingore the pirate rules and instead cooperate, share, help out, and trust each other.

Another \\"How to Draw\\" book from the series by Walter Foster. For 7 and up, it helps if you have some very basic drawing skills before you try this book, but you don't have to. These \\"how to draw\\" books that feature comic heroes are even more fun if you have some basic skills first, then use these books to practice with. The Batman has been drawn in many different styles over the years, and this is the style from the 1990's animated series from Warner Brothers. It is very comprehensive and has Batman, Robin, Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred, Police Commissioner Gordon, Batgirl, and villians including The Joker,Two-Face, Mr. Freeze, The Penguin, Catwoman, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, The Riddler and more. Gadgets like the utility belt and batarangs are included, of course the batmobile, and even backgrounds from Gotham City and the Batcave to draw. It starts in very simple steps that progress to a complete drawing.  To see more drawing books for kids you might want to check my lists on the subject.

There are period accounts from those that dealt with pirates and knew firsthand of their behaviour, diet, ships, culture, and methods. The book also discusses those that pursued the pirates to justice. A comprehensive discussion of pirate flags, and treasures lost. Information on islands and colonies frequnted by the pirates. Also has biographies on many infamous pirates including Sir Henry Morgan, Walter Kennedy, Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, Edward Low, Henry Every, Stede Bonnet, Emanuel Wynne, Jack Rackam, Christopher Moody, Edward Teach, Bartholomew Roberts, and many others. Includes a rare mention of female pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read. Oversized format, nice black hardcover with gold gilt lettering, looks like leather but its not.

But that is where the problems start, since the book is full of errors. It claims to be a reference book for Jonny Quest fans on the history of the show, with programming broadcast history, episode lists, synopsis of the plots from every episode, trivia, voice actor credits, merchandising, original sponsors, and character guides including villians and other supporting characters. The book does list the original series episodes from 1964, and the update episodes from 1986. This book is notorious in Jonny Quest fan circles for it's many episode errors and the vital items that it strangely omits, so buy it for the fun of having a Quest team item, but definately not as an accurate reference tool. Some of the biggest errors are in the synopsis of plots from episodes. Other errors are in character descriptions, such as when it claims that Hadji joined the team after saving Race Bannon from an asassin's  dagger. But in the show, it was actually Dr. Quest he saved from the dagger. And the biggest error of all? It lists the wrong television network as first having aired the series,... it premiered on ABC, not NBC as this book states.<br /><br />Since it was published in 1995, it does not have the late 1990's \\"Real Adventures of Jonny Quest Series\\", nor does it have the movie, \\"Jonny Quest versus the Cyber Insects\\". It does list the previous movie, \\"Jonny's Golden Quest\\". There is no information on video releases. It is a small hardcover book, yellow cloth with a maroon cloth binding, 7.25 high x 4.5 inches wide, 85 pages in length, and to the publishers credit the original illustrations in black and white all true to the show.

The Academy Award (R)winning \\"True Life Adventure Series\\" are some of the most enjoyable documentaries ever made. Fascinating behind the scenes stories on how they filmed shuch classics as \\"Nikki, Wild Dog of the Nort\\", or \\"The Legend of Lobo\\", or Truel Life Adventure stories like \\"Grand Canyon\\", \\"The Living Desert\\". It took a year and a half to film Lobo, and we learn how they got the wolf to cross a log across a steep canyopn, and the tricks they taught an eagle. Very inspiring for anyone that seeks a career in this field.  Couffer's work is featured prominently in the vast library of live action movies made by the studio for theatrical and television distribution. I beleive this has been out of print since 1965.	2005-07-27

Camping is actually a pretty broad term anymore... There are tent campers, car campers, backpackers, RV'ers. canoe campers, and on and on. This leans slightly towards backpacking, and does a nice job squeezing in many of the most important points for beginners. He helps you chose some basic gear such as a camp stove, sleeping bag, tent, knives, clothing, boots, pack, etc. The book probably concentrates on preparing food more than anything, and that is appropriate considering where you will be. He also helps put together a packing list, ideas for cooking and recipes, and many important safety tips.<br />This is a nice supplemental item for your library of books on the subject if you have one and enjoy collecting them as I do.	2005-07-27

Naturally it has advice for longer trips into the real woods, from gear selection, to packing lists, how to pack it all in, how-to put it toghether, how will you cook, how to light a fire, and more. But it also has a great emphasis on what to do when you get there, how to plan fun for the kids, (or how to keep them busy) and includes nature activities, games, and songs. It also has some great but simple camping recipes. 64 pages with full-color illustrations.

It was to be an easy sailing for the young sailor, since he had made many 3 day trips with his uncle. But a freak storm sweeps David out to sea totally unprepared - no water, no radio, 2 days of food, no wind, he is stranded at sea. And then it gets worse. The book features a map, and a helpful diagram of the boat so the reader can understand the different parts by their proper name.

This book was awarded the Newberry Medal in 1923. A tale of 17th English century life at sea, it is a rousing and realistic story. The author spent years researching ships logs, sailing accounts, and the life stories of many sailing men to get the proper flavor for his tale. A reviewer complained about the old fashioned language, but I think any book about a period in time does a disservice to young people by avoiding using the authentic accents, terminology, and phrasing of the time. To not do so is to rob the reader of the experience of joining the adventure and falling into the story completely. I think that classic period books that have been abridged into modern-speak to make them easier to read are simply talking down to readers and underestimating their capacity and curiosity to learn.<br /><br />The plot is an adventure of a young man that has been on ships since he was a toddler, and the horrible and good people he interacts with after a horrible accident on land with a gun makes him a fugitive. He goes to the place he knows best, the sea. He joins a ship that is later seized by pirates. Forced to cooperate or die, he unwillingly joins them in operating the vessel but refuses to participate in their bloodthirsty pursuits. And there is action galore, storms, sea battles between ships, attacks on forts, sword fights, cannon fire, you name it.<br /><br />The characters are interesting and multi-faceted, not gray cutouts but realistic... A woman in a tavern is kind and generous in the beginning, but as soon as she has nothing to gain for her kindness she turns on him viciously. A pirate leader is cold and cruel but points he \\"bears no ill will\\", like a mafia don stating before he kills that it is nothing personal, just business.  And many characters are not what they seem at first. Our young hero manages to survive day by day with his own cunning, and turn the dark situation to his own gain to escape, clear his name, and discover surprising things about his own ancestors. The plot switches and turns many times, always with a new surprise around the bend. A very enjoyable story, I highly recommend.<br /><br />By the way, if you have a child or adult that wants to be able to look up the sailing terminology in many of the sea tales (what's a mizzen for example), or simply wants to read more books like this one, try one of the books in my recommendations  list at Amazon that has definitions and pictures for these terms, \\"Seafaring and Pirate books for young people\\", or at least try one of the following books:<br />\\"A Sea of Words\\", or \\"Traditions of the Navy\\", Manual of Seamanship for Boys and Seamen of the Royal Navy\\", and \\"Sailing Ships at a Glance\\".wn gain to escape, clear his name, and discover surprising things about his own ancestors.

In the story three young boys, (ages 15, 18, and 13), are shipwrecked alone on an island, and are actually making the best of it.

She is an orphaned teenager being raised in rough manner by her new guardian, who mostly uses her as a slave which includes regular beatings. To make matters worse her idyllic village is being taken over by a greedy local squire who is scheming to take away the local farms and businesses. In their place will be the shops, farms, and Inns that he will own, and the verdant farmland will be dug up for coal.<br /><br />Mallory always loved the old stories of magic and wizards.  Unbelievably, she manages to rescue a real wizard named Arbican trapped in a tree. The wizard she finds is shockingly different than in the stories. He won't grant 3 wishes for one thing even though she rescued him. And to top it off, rather than showing his gratitude and helping her in her miserable state, he is permanently grouchy and wants to leave immediately.  Confusingly for Mallory, she has to feed him and protect him, rather than the other way around.<br /><br />The plot has many surprises and keeps you guessing. It delivers plenty of suspense and big surprises. I believe that in the long run the story is about the magic that we all have within, through perseverance, ingenuity, bravery, and other positive traits that get us through hard times. Arbican's magic takes a back seat to all of these, but usually in a hilarious way. When he is able to use his magic, it is usually done wrong... such as the time he wants to fly and turns himself into a goose instead. \\"Catch hold! The spell's gone wrong! Pull me down! I'm floating away!\\"<br /><br />It is a short book, but fast-paced at 134 pages. Great coverart. There is a lot if fun in this story, it is a quick read, with an upbeat ending.

In the story a mouse named Abel is living a life of leisure with his wife Amanda. He is a wealthy high society fellow who does not work but lives comfortably with money provided by his wealthy mother, drinking champagne and eating caviar. During a picnic, Abel is swept into the river only to be beached on a deserted island. He sits down to await his rescue that never comes. He wants his old life badly with his comfortable bed, snug house, books, and clean clothes.<br /><br />But he is stranded now and must learn to survive. As a spoiled rich mouse, he does not know how to fend for himself, yet he has become a Robinson Crusoe of sorts. As his old leisurely self disappears, Abel teaches himself create fire, to find and store food such as mushrooms and seeds, build shelter, and to make pottery to eat with. He fights off an owl determined to eat him, and never stops trying to find a way off the island. He is an intelligent, inventive fellow, and builds rafts, tries to swim the strong rive current, builds a bridge, uses stepping stones, rope, a catapult, and even a glider, all with disastrous results.  He has to make use of his extra time on his hands and he finally learns he has an artistic side which brings him to sculpt life size images of his friends and loved ones. His perseverance is incredible against all odds and fears and he never gives up trying.<br /><br />The author never uses \\"kid talk\\" in his books, but uses intelligent vocabulary in a way that does not put off kids, but increases their interest. Honestly no kid that begins reading this story can put it down, and any adult is captivated by the language the author uses to tell his tale. Abel's life strength lies in his never ending love for his wife. And we as the reader are helped to realize how lucky we are to be home with the ones that love us. Truly a gem.<br /><br />After you read the story, if you want a bit more of Abel's world you see him on a VHS tape by the same name. It is available from the childrens department at your local library, or you can buy it \\"used\\" here at Amazon like I did.

Arcanum is a world, a society, where everyone has magic powers. The homes that float in the air, shops, manufacturing, lighting, food preparation, mage robes, door locks, vehicles that fly, everything... is created and powered by magic. The social structure is set up by the politically powerful guilds that run everything. The guilds are hostile to one another, forming political alliances and enemies. They are often made up of different races and species, who have brutalized the weaker races to the point of extinction.<br /><br />Thrown into this chaotic world is Timothy, who was believed by the guilds to be dead at birth, but was secretly whisked to another dimension that has no magic by his father. He lives with a few companions there where he grows to a teen and becomes educated in making mechanical devices that are completely unnecessary on Arcanum. Why would his father, the most respected and powerful wizard of his day do such a thing? Because Timothy was born without any magic powers at all! He would be a weakling in the world of powerful mages. You would assume as I did that this means that he would be ignored when he returns to a world run by magic, but this young man is feared enough to suffer multiple attempts to assassinate him as soon as he arrives in his fathers house. He has been labeled by the suspicious guilds to be the most dangerous person in the world, and he doesn't know why. The government weighs in and wants him destroyed too.<br /><br />No one can be trusted in this environment, and danger leaps from every corner and even those that are supposed to protect Timothy may be his next attackers. This one keeps you on edge and guessing throughout the story.<br /><br />Personally I couldn't put this page turner down to sleep at night. It is a shame that another reviewer stopped reading the book at a slow moment and never returned, and yet felt compelled to review an unfinished book. Yes, it does slow down a bit in parts, only to whisk off again like a roller coaster that gets over the hill. I like this variation of pacing, since real life is like that as well.

His perseverance is incredible against all odds and fears, he never gives up trying.<br /><br />The author never uses kid talk in his books, but uses intelligent vocabulary in a way that does not put off kids, but increases their interest. No kid that begins reading this story can put it down, and any adult is captivated by the language the author uses to tell his tale. Abel's life strength lies in his never ending love for his wife. And we as the reader are helped to realize how lucky we are to be home with the ones that love us. Truly a gem.<br /><br />And when you have read the book and need a bit more of Abel's world, you can buy the animated version on VHS or check it out in the childrens section of your local library. It is well done. The artwork is true to Steig's gentle illustrations. It is usually available \\"used\\" here on Amazon.ut in the childrens section of your local library. It is well done.

The book is part of a series of books about Bernie Magruder who lives with his family in the Besseldorf Hotel, which they own. The stories are about small-town life. It is silly while being a bit scary at the same time. Bernie and his friend Georgene and Weasel are amateur detectives that solve crimes and mysteries in town, despite the fact that they are kids. There are numerous stories happening at the same time, such as the controversial new drive up window at the funeral parlor to view the deceased. And a business is robbed while one of the owners vanishes. There is humor, action, and enough mild spookiness for any kid to enjoy, and it makes me want to read other books in the series.	2005-03-23

In answering the origin of Peter Pan and the rest of the characters in Neverland, the authors have written a Peter Pan that is one of the most exciting versions of the tale yet.<br /><br />Peter is an orphan boy living in the city where other boys look up to him for his wits and protection.  He is kind and smart despite growing up in a harsh environment without an education or family to teach him love. He is given or sold to a ship called The Never Land who in turn will sell him as a slave to a king on a distant island. .  Another lead character, Molly, is very brave and resourceful. She is from the exact opposite background, with wealth, education, and a loving family, yet they connect immediately. Molly has a lot of secrets such as mysterious powers that seem too impossible to be true.<br /><br />The character of Hook is not identified right away and the story leaves you guessing as to who he will be. There are numerous bad guys and the threat to Peter and Molly is constantly changing. There is a trunk that holds \\"the greatest treasure on earth\\" and many men are willing to die to get their hands on it. This story is full of mystery, tropical islands, natives, strange creatures, swordfights, sailing ships and shipwrecks, pirates, and much more. People are not what they seem and you are kept guessing throughout the story. The characters are richly developed to the point that you feel you are there. This story will be read for many years by boys and girls alike, and adults too. It is very exciting and hard to put down. The cover art and interior illustrations are very nice too.	2005-03-23

This book is a comprehensive history of Disney on television, with \\"The Wonderful World of Disney\\" anthology show as the centerpiece. As a kid I grew up watching Uncle Walt every Sunday night, on \\"The Wonderful World of Disney\\". Back then we were not bombarded with 24 hour cable, satellite, vcr, dvd, video games,...  We had 4 channels to choose from, and even those rarely had anything watchable for kids. And as a result no kid missed Sunday nights with Walt Disney. He always had something exciting on, adventure, historical stories, action, cartoons, animal fare, you name it! I sat in front of the tube mesmerized with my dinner on a TV tray, the only night my mom let me eat in front of the TV. Parents could always trust Walt Disney to give us wholesome entertainment. Now we have grown up, and the old television series is gone but not forgotten as long as you have this book.<br /><br />There are hundreds of books on Disney's animated fare, but scant few have been written on their wonderful treasure trove of live action films, much less their material created specifically for television. There are books on specific shows, but none yet that bring them all together like this. Bill Cotter has done what no one else has attempted, to create a list of every single episode for every television show ever made: it's actors, plotline, trivia, air dates and rerun dates for every single show Disney ever made up to the date of publication. And he has done a fine job when you consider there are hundreds of episodes, aired 52 weeks a year, for 29 years. He takes the time to tell you if the episode was theatrically released first or televised first, overseas or domestic, if it was a feature that was edited not a movie or edited from a movie for TV, and even if it aired or released in a different name. He even lets you know what Disney did with the episode in the European market.<br /><br />This book has been a wonderful resource to assist me in finding old episodes that I can't remember the name for but vividly remember the story, confirming that the child actors are the famous persons I see in the movies now, or checking to see which video I want to track down next. Very comprehensive at 628 pages. Not a ton of pictures, but some good ones. Some books on Disney use too many pictures as a crutch for lacking content, but not this one. The back of the book has a massive appendix with tons of information on every episode, such as the writer, director, producer, actors, original story material source, screenplay writer, composers, visual effects, and so on... basically the entire credits for every episode are listed here.<br /><br />But it doesn't end there, he lists every episode of Mickey Mouse Club, the New Mickey Mouse Club and their respective serials; Zorro; Specials; and special releases of themovies to TV.  Also has obscure limited series forgotten by time like Small & Frye, Zorro and Son, Meet Me at Disneyland, Gun Shy, or Wildside. The only source I can find for the many specials, series, and films of the Disney Channel. Saturday Mornings and Disney Afternoons animation is here like DuckTales, Wuzzles, Gummi Bears, Winnie the Pooh, Chp 'n Dale's Rescue Rangers, Tale Spin, Bonkers, Aladdin, Little Mermaid, Timon & Pumba, Gargoyles, and all the rest. And the \\"non-Disney\\" labeled stuff they made like  Blossom, Home Improvement, Golden Girls, Nurses, Empty Nest, Boy Meets World, The Torkelsons, Dinosaurs, and all the other syndicated series from Touchstone Television. It even lists the unaired episodes!<br /><br />The author of this book chose to include other shows that are so-called \\"not Disney\\", the Touchstone shows like the \\"Golden Girls\\". You have to remember that Disney Studios bought ABC Television, and prior to that was producing television medium at the Florida studio for the networks that did not have the Disney name plastered all over it, but was still made by the Disney company. They were just trying to be completist, and you get more information as a consumer at no extra cost. I myself am not interested in many of those Touchstone shows so I simply skipped that part of the book, no harm done there.  Frankly, there is no other book at this time that lists every single episode of the legacy of Walt in his Wonderful World of Disney show. Trust me, this book is a treat for any Disney TV fan.<br /><br />A reviewer felt like some of the descriptions of each episode were too short, but there were 29 years of episodes on 3 different networks for the anthology show alone to cover in the book, and I feel that under the circumstances they did very well with a paragraph or two on each episode.  The book is already 628 pages long, and is much bigger than a large dictionary. Any more and it would honestly be unmanagable.<br /><br />Since it is a history book first and foremost, the shows are listed from the oldest shows to the newest. Then within each show, such as Zorro, they list the episodes in the order they were aired. The exception is \\"The Wonderful World of Disney\\" which is done alphabetically, since so many of those episodes played multiple times over the years, or were mutli-part episodes, but most of all because the fans remember them by name but not neccesarily by air date. It really does make it easier this way.  It lists episodes by the title name, which in a multi-part show like \\"Johnny Tremain\\" can get confusing at first. But the book usually tells you in one listing the names of the other parts of the story so you can track them down. For example on page 97 it begins with the main title Davy Crockett, then lists the 5 episode names of the original series so you can look them up by name. Then it list the 5 episodes from the 1988 remake series. It does the same with Elfego Baca, Gallagher, and other shows and even movies that were renamed as episodes after editing. The layout of the book takes a little extra effort to understand at first, but over time I have come to appreicate it very much and frankly would not change it.<br /><br />This is a great resource for info on theatrical releases and featurettes too since most aired on the show sooner or later. I strongly reccommend this book to any Disney fan or historian. It is one of the most valuable reference books in my Disney collection of over 100 books.<br /><br />Sadly the original Disney anthology shows have seen almost no attention from the studio by way of DVD release, and most episodes on VHS were printed in the 1980's.  There are a number of episodes from the show still available \\"used\\" on VHS, simply do a search at Amazon under, \\"The Wonderful World of Disney\\". And if you use this book like I did you can find almost half of the Disney episodes ever made were released on VHS back in the '80s under their original episode titles. Buy them while you still can. I highly reccommend this hugely important reference to Disney television.t no extra cost.

If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. It has real honest reviews from the perspective of a moviegoer that just wants to be entertained , not that overly intellectual stuff you read sometimes and say, \\"Did this reviewer see the same movie as I did\\"?  The reviews are  fun to read and very funny at times.<br />But don't kid yourself, it is all here. Foreign films, samurai, westerns, 50's sci-fi, art films, you name it.  And it has a categories index so you can quickly locate all the films in your personal favorite type of film.<br />This book is huge! No other guide I have seen tries to include every film ever made, the other review books snobbily skip the movies they decide are not important. Not this book, it has over 25,000 films!!! This is very comprehensive, which makes this book much bigger than the other guys guides. But that is OK, I hate the other reviewers guides since they do not have all the movies this one does.<br />Very easy to use and locate a film quickly. You can cross reference anything with the great index and layout of this guide. Indexes to look up films by director, writer, composer, cinematographer, or actor, awards, series, as well as title or alternate titles. Even has an internet guide. I have bought quite a few movie guides, but if I could only have one, this is it.	2003-02-21

Very nice illustrations on every page, and nice ones too. Book tries to tell what a Pirates life was like in reality, at least the best way you can describe it to an elementary school student. That is the age this book fits best. Has a neat replica of the \\"Pirates Code of Conduct\\", which really is the warped honor among thieves rules they went by.  Examples of real pirate flags. Briefly touches on a few famous real pirates too.<br /><br />If you like this one, check the other great book \\"Cowboys\\" from this series/publisher. It is even better than this one!	2003-02-21

I just bought this recently, and it is much better than I even expected. I have a bunch of camping books in my library, and this one is better than many more expensive adult books. It has great advice even for adults, but is indespensible for camping with kids. It teaches you how to build a fire safely, cooking on the fire, (great kid favorites recipes), dealing with bugs, how to pick a camp site, what kind of Lots of safety tips too. The fun drawings make this a pleasure as well.<br />The authors show you how to make a reflector oven. The main feature if this book is the fun activities for around the fire such as stories songs, games, etc. Teaches kids how to identify the stars easily and even identify features on the face of the moon. I plan to use this with our Cub Scouts.	2003-02-21

I had camped once a month for many years and had tried all kinds of tricks to save money when camping, make your own gear, fun outdoor recipes, etc. but this book had tons of new ideas I had never heard of. 20 years after the first edition of this book means the author has updated it to our times, but it still great. This has always been indespensable to me. It really has made camping more fun and I reccommend it to anyone that takes kids camping, but you don't have to have them to try this stuff.<br />Lots of delicious recipes and methods to cook, but other stuff on first aid and making your campsite comfortable in many ways is featured. Features many ways to build a fire, how to make firestarters to speed up your firestarting, make your own waterproof matches, make your own campstove.<br />She shows you how to make a meal in a hollowed orange (cake in an orange!)or onion nestled in the coals! Cook eggs on a flat rock, recipes to cook on sticks, in foil, etc. Lots of ideas for home made items that will save you time and money in the woods. A hot water tank that sits in the fire; an outdoor sink made in seconds with a shovel and garbage bag; how to keep your pans clean the easy way; packing lists; use a can for a rolling pin in a pich; how to make lanterns from cans. One of my favorits was the tiny stove you make out of a coffee can. How to make a reflector oven for the woods, and 3 more types of ovens. (how about a cardboard box for an oven, it works).<br />Other books published since have borrowed some ideas from this one, but they were here first. Pictures and sketches on nearly every page are very helpful. The writing style is fun and easy to read.	2003-02-16

This book is about the development of ride vehicles and technology at a little company called Arrow. They may have been small but they made a huge impact on the ride and theme park industry. They invented the first steel tubular track coaster for example, and it is known as \\"The Matterhorn\\" at Disneyland.<br /><br />Nice stories from the owners memories of how it was back in the day... They worked on nearly everything that had ride vehicles. Disney designed and built alot of stuff right at the Disney studio machine shop, but these guys built a lot of ride vehicles and tracks for Disney as well. Pirates of the Caribbean boat vehicle, flying saucers, small world boats, mine train cars, Autopia cars. They built stuff for other long-gone parks you rarely hear about anymore, like Freedomland.<br /><br />There are tons of great photos in here, (including Walt testing some ride vehicles), but it is not a coffee table book by any means. Be forewarned that this book does not give enough credit to the great Bob Gurr, a Disney Imagineer at WED who did tons of basic engineering, design, and drafting for most of the great ride vehicles that Arrow built for Disney. They do have some nice stuff about him on page 81, just not enough. The book tends to omit other people as well.<br /><br />The book seems unfinished, and leaves you wanting so much more. There is no index to look things up as a reference. The writing style kind of ambles around with no clear direction. BUT having said all this, it is still an interesting book if you are consumed with the subject of amusement ride design and construction, especially Disney's. If you have a Disney book library, this should be in it. I would not give up my copy, I just wish it were a little better.	2003-02-16

Has an interesting method to make a hot water heater for the woods, but it is a lot of work. The home made stuff is definately not light-weight and is for car campers only. For some reason it has the small section on tents and sleeping bags repeated twice. Lots of neat ideas here though, but make sure if you can only buy one you buy their first book.

My father, aunt, and I are all avid readers and fans of Milne and all things Pooh. But this book was very dry and agonizingly slow. Interesting in bits and pieces, but none of us could finish the book. In my family that is a rarity for any book. It is really about the life of the son of the original author of the Pooh books. You do get a usual sense of the frustration of those who have famous parents here. The bset thing about the book was the 6 pictures in the book. They feature the original pooh toys, the real pooh sticks bridge, and the real hollow tree in England that A.A. Milne used in his stories. I was really looking forward to more.	2003-02-16

If you plan to backpack for one day, to a long trip, this book covers it all from weather, to clothing, gear, stoves, food, shoes, maps, you name it. And it is well written so that you don't really have to scan it like a catolog. You will find the writing style so comfortable, you will read it like a novel from front to end.

Most of the reviews are from the Marcinko Autobiography, and for some reason thay have been added to other books by the author. As you read these, don't blame the reviewers if you are reading about the wrong book. On to my own review...<br />For sheer adventure and excitement, this is hard to beat. The autobiographical account of one of the original creators of the deadly Seal Team covert operations squads. Richard was a former frogman and UDT member. He was also a wild, drinking, swearing, fighting guy whose outrageous courage and antics led him from a man with little education, to a top official in the US Navy Seals. On the way he broke the rules, rankled officers, and pushed for the best treatment and gear he could get for his men. By necessity these man lived hard and fought hard.<br /><br />In the end of his career he claims the navy went after him on a personal agenda to drive him out on drummed up criminal charges, jealous officers and so forth. It may be true, and it may also be that the exact skills and temperament that made him so effective against the enemy were a detriment when dealing with the whitewashed pencil pushers at the pentagon. It is tough to be a stone cold killer in peacetime and just turn that aggression on and off.<br /><br />To hear another persons opinion on what happened to Marcinko, read \\"Brave Men Dark Waters\\" also sold at Amazon.com.  It's author, Orr Kelly, says he was in the Seals with Marcinko and as part of his own book tells his version of Marcinko as an out of control egotist, a real rogue warrior. Read these and other books, and you be the judge. Regardless, I could not put this book from Marcinko down, very exciting.	2003-02-01

This is a great book, very entertaining, and even in my own pile of books on Disney, it stands out as being the only book that focuses strictly on their live action subject. The author breaks down each film he covers, listing title, cast and crew, synopsis, and a review (he does a great job at this). He includes behind the scenes information and comments from original participants I have never seen published anywhere else. The only thing is is lacking is it has very few pictures, and and it needs some more interviews with the principle screenwriters, actors, directors, and such. While it does not cover all the live films, overall it is very comprehensive considering the library of live action films from Disney is much bigger than most people realize. It is also currently the BEST and most COMPLETE book on this specific subject. I am grateful at having found this book, and look forward to any future releases from the author or an expanded version of this book.<br /><br />If you want more books to consider on the subject of live Disney films, I reccommend the following books for sale at Amazon: \\"The Wonderful World of Disney Television\\" by Bill Cotter; \\"The Disney Films\\" by Leonard Maltin; \\"The Disney Studio Story\\" by Richard Hollis and Brian Sibley; \\"The Wonderful World of Disney Animals\\" by Disney's chief movie animal trainer William Koehler; \\"Walt, Backstage Adventures with Walt Disney\\" by Charles Shows; \\"One of Walt's Boys\\" by Harry Tytle.	2003-02-01

It is written like a diary in that it is very complete and detailed. He managed that by taking notes of his experiance and sending them home. The result is a very clear picture of his experiance, frustrations, danger, victories, etc. He shows us the little details of daily life that are missing from most Viet Nam biographies.

I have quite a few cookbooks, and even more camping books. I would rate this as one of the better books I have read about cooking in the woods. The instructions are easy to follow and the recipes are delicious. There are about 200 tasty recipes total, and he uses camp stoves, dutch ovens, reflector ovens, and the fire itself. The book has advice on pans and what to pack. He shows you how to cook the meals for big groups and small alike. And there are plenty of fun recipes for kids and scouts in here as well. He shows you how to cook in foil to cut down on dishes and pans, and other timesavers.<br />He also shows you differnet methods to build fires, and how to make a few home-made grills and stoves economically.<br />If you only buy one camp cook book, this would be a good choice.<br />If you buy this title buy the one with the 2nd edition marker on it, it is much improved.	2003-02-01

The books in chronological order are 1)Currahee! 2) The Road to Arnhem 3) Seven Roads to Hell 4) Beyond the Rhime.<br /><br />For those who call WWII, the last \\"good war\\", this is a wake up. This war was just as full of horror and nightmare as any conflict, and the men treated as poorty. We get a view of the daily misery of the troops between the episodes of their bravery driven by the urge to kill or be killed.<br /><br />The author was a member of the Screaming Eagles 101st division, who was rushed to the participate in the Normandy invasion in order to hold Bastogne, where 7 roads converged. He who held Bastogne controlled the speed of access to the country and Bastogne was critical to the Battle of the Bulge.<br /><br />The division had not been able to receive the usual rest and resupply that comes after the big battle they had just returned from, when they were rushed into this fight and left there alone and outnumbered. They had little blankets, cold weather clothing, weapons, ammunition, heavy mechanized armour, medicical support, air support, or anything else they needed in order to do their job. This was not only due to poor planning, incompetence by commanders, confusing and conflicting orders, but even due to theft by other units of their precious goods. It is a miracle that they held out.<br /><br />They won and lost their positions many times, as the US troops frantically held onto the positions that would help keep other troops alive. This book is the most graphic and honest  description of being an active fighting soldier in WWII I have read and left a deep impression on me. It is a great read, and I could not put it down. The authors style, language and pacing are very good, top notch!	2003-02-01

The illustrations are charming and full of detail, and Matthew really saves the day from the cattle rustlers. He is a smart young hero, and the story helps you learn the names of cowboy gear such as chaps, bridle, spurs, etc. which is a really nice touch by the author. I also enjoyed the little desert creatures that seemed to follow Matthew around.<br /><br />The story of cows being re-branded has been done before, but of course that does not mean the author borrowed, it is just the same idea.  In the Donald Duck story from October 1948 \\"Sheriff of Bullet Valley\\" written and illustrated by the great Carl Barks, the rustlers re-branded the cattle over the existing mark.<br />It is still a fun book, and well worth the very affordable price here at Amazon.com.

It is charming, lyrical, and full of whimsey... yet it is an adventure first and foremost. Blaycock has a writing style that makes the words sound delicious in your mind, as each carefully chosen word fits together like a song.  He is also at his humerous best here, and will have you chuckling along. That is when your mouth is not watering for the food that he describes here as an intregal part of the adventure.  He makes the character  a part of you by making it very real and not sparing the details that somehow make you experiance the book with all of your  senses.  That is if you like the sound smell and feel of warm crackly fires on cold nights, hand ground coffee roasted on the fire, cheese from the Master Cheeser, dark nutty beer, thick dark fresh bread, reading books for hours and hours, and the scent of pipe tobacco as much as this character does.<br />The sequel is called \\"The Dissapearing Dwarf\\" but I saw it listed with a typo at this site as \\"The Dissapearg Dwarf\\".	2002-11-26

He is an islander living a simple exhistance, when his fishermanfather is killed by a shark. After that he is afraid of the sea and deemed useless by the villagers that live off the sea. He gets lost on a deserted island and must learn to fend for himself. The villagers all assume that this clumsy boy could not make it one day on his own, but he does very well indeed. His Robinson Crusoe-like adventure is one that folks like us could not survive, since he was more prepared than we could ever hope to be since his people lived off the land and sea already.  By the way, in 1972 the Walt Disney studio made a very very nice live action version of this for their weekly tv show and you can do a search for the vhs version and get a used copy here at Amazon.	2002-11-20

I have most of the booksI had when I was a kid, (of course I wish I had the few I lost) and I still buy them and read them and save them for my son.  He will be enjoying Dads extensive library some day.  This book is one of 3 current books from this author , none of them having anthing to do with the other so they are not a series.<br /><br />This was totally different than \\"Secret of Platform 13\\" and is nmot the samecharacters or location.  This story has a bit of romance and might appeal more to girls than boys, but if boys will stick it out they will enjoy the overall book.  Great bits about some fumbling old witches that can't seem to get things right, a young adult white witch that can't help being good even if the other withces dislike her for it, and a dark wizard who really is not a bad guy after all.  And his servants are really nice guys, you will wish you could have them as friends yourself.  The young witch rescues a boy from an orphanage and they becoem fast friends.  The book has a great ending, very satisfying.<br /><br />The writer is fun and humerous, and chooses words that make the story crackle and seem to play out in front of your eyes.  Some  scary stuff, but nothing to give you nightmares.  I read the story in a few hours straight sine I could not put it down.  I can't wait until I read the \\"Island of Aunts\\".	2002-05-28

Mr. Paulsen declares in the back of this book that this is the 4th and last in the series that begin with Hatchet, then The River, then Brians Winter, and now Brians Return.  The writer also explains how the comparisons in his own life lead him to write this book.  The Brian books are very good, and this one is no exeption, except that it is much too short.  That is common with this writer though, his books are short but packed with fast paced adventure, the beautiful outdoors, and appealing characters.<br />It seems almost like the writer intended to return to the series for the purpose of finding closure for Brian.  Some readers do not feel that closure is achieved though. We do know that Brian does not want to leave the woods ever again.	2002-05-28

I don't buy books that lean on those cheap tricks to tell their story.  A good writer can build suspense and action and adventure without devoting 10 panels straight of fighting. I was desensitized to that stuff I saw so much of it in movies and books for awhile, and I am happier having trimmed it out of my life to a great extent.  Now I seek items like this book that can tell a great story without grossing me out.<br /> Having said that this book is good clean adventure.  It goes to a great locale in Scotalnd, and the artist does a fine job of giving you some flavor of the region.  He does great with the accents too.  Now Tintin gets shot, but it is a minor scene without blood, like the old west shows.  This is a most enjoyable adventure.<br />Now at times the dialog goes from full and interesting to too simple (jarringly so) as if the writer had worked on it on different timeperiods, and sometimes does not seem fluid.  But that makes me wonder how much is just lost in the translation from the original French language. TinTin races or maybe rushes from one mini-adventure into the next at a breathtaking pace that does not always allow for the characters motivations to be explained and so some stereotyping does occur.  The thought ballons of the dog are not neccesary and cheapen the story, to my view.<br />Even with these minor complaints this is a fun book.  Reading it maeks you feel as if you have stumbled onto secret treasure since these books are notnpart of the American mainstream. The art is great, and the locales, even the costumes are obviously researched with a very period sense.  The castle is very well drawn and the draftsmanship of buildings, vehicles, and landscapes are superb.  This softcover edition has great paper, strong cover material, good binding, and very nice color job in inking.<br />While I think that the story development/plotlines and dialog work of comic book artist/writer Carl Barks is superior, I really enjoyed this book.<br />I understand that of the 20 plus Tintin books, there are some real jewels.  This book was enough to hook my interest.I look forward to reading the rest.<br />While I think that the story development/plotlines and dialog work of comic book artist/writer Carl Barks is superior, I really enjoyed this book.  <br />I understand that of the 20 plus Tintin books, there are some real jewels.

Francis is on his own, having learned so many survival skills from Mr. Grimes in the previous book.  Once again he is forced to have his posessions (horse, rifle, clothes) taken from him by force. But the outcome is different this time, since Francis is much wiser even if he is 14.  He is able to take care of himself just as well as any adult.  Francis helps some kids, hunts buffalo, meets with Indians, and other frontier activity.  The mule in this book steals the show by the way.<br /><br />The only bad thing about this book is it is short.  I read it in about an hour, and it is half the size of the first book.  Don't get me wrong though, I sped through the book because you can't wait to turn the page and see what happens next.  Mr. Grimes is not in this story.  I can't wait to read the next book.  I strongly reccommend reading the book that comes first in the series before reading this, the second one.	2002-05-07

Set in the ranching country but in modern times, it gives you such a feel for the isolation and beauty of the sheepherders life.  This was a subject I have always been curious about, and I look forward to reading other books about the subject.

He trys to get in any way he can, so he can show them his great acrobatic tricks. He finally balances on his nose when the train goes by to get their attention. The book is a sweet story with nice illustrations.<br /><br />According to Bill Peets autobiography, this book was his favorite because it reflected his own past .  The story of Chester the pigs journey to join the circus is similar to Peet's own journey as a young man to try to get work for Disney studios as an animator in his younger days. Peet did in fact become a successful animator and storymand for Disney. Roscoe the master showman in the story, is in reality Bill's old boss Walt Disney.  Walt was respected by Peet, even if they had their differences.  If you like Bill Peets books, be sure to read his autobiography, and this book.	2002-04-10

They each have big moveable sections which are supposed to be fun for kids to rearrange their play structure. It is a good concept but these pieces are big and a kid could get injured very easily by dropping one on themselves or another child.  Contrary to the books description, this does NOT include plans on building a climbing net or a climbing rope (which was the main reason I bought it in the first place).<br /><br />The first third of its limited pages tells you \\"why\\" you should build a play structure.  You probably have a reason why you want to build or you would not be trying to read a book on it.  What we want to know is \\"how\\" to build one. Thankfully I came back to Amazon and found out there are much better books on the subject like the David Stiles books.  Now he knows how to build imaginative play structures, play houses, and tree houses.  The book on this page mentions in the beginning how great treehouses are, but has no instructions how to build one in the entire book. If you are in doubt borrow it from the library before buying, otherwise I do not reccommend.	2002-03-20

It is a long book with tons of tips and details, not just someone elses drawings to copy.  Shows you haw to create movement and many other animators tips for the aspiring young animator.  Both my son and I love taking turns with this book. This is one of the nicest quality books of all the Walter Foster books, it has tons of stuff from Warner Brothers including rare background art. The book is bigger, longer than the others. Also it has higher quality paper and binding than the other titles in the series. Has sections on adding color, mood and affect in backgrounds, and a lot of animator info such as walk cycle, running cycle, storyboards, voice recording, color palletes for each character, model sheets, shortcuts and more. So it is much more a How to Animate book, that the How to Draw books I usually get from this company. The book is getting rare sine it has been out of print for 10 years.	2002-03-11

I own all of the Emberly books. They are fun for adults and kids alike. You are never too old or young to learn to draw. This book will make you the most hip doodler in school or at work. Ed makes it really easy!<br />This book is from a series of 4 books from Emberly are the easiest books on drawing there are, period. Anyone young or old can learn to draw some great critters and vehicles from these books. ANYONE! All of his Big Color books are great, (They are a series, each named after a color). This one is famous for the easy way it shows you how to draw step by step a great big green dragon, but it is simple when you do it his way. This book includes a number of fun ideas including Frankenstein, sailboat and trees. He even shows you how to make yours unique rather than a copy of his drawings. You can be the doodle hero of your classroom or office after using this book. He does it simply using very simple steps, lines, and basic shapes to start you off. My favorite in the series would be the Purple Book, but they are all good.<br />If you want to move up from here and learn the terminology of what you are doing, and really become an accomplished artist, the next step after these are the terrific books by \\"Jack Hamm\\". If you just want to have some fun, get this book!	2002-03-11

I use this to conduct art classes in cub scouts. I always enjoyed making very tiny drawings in the borders of my notebooks at school, and later as an adult I find myself still doodling during meetings.  This book is for those of us who love to doodle. It shows you how to make the coolest little drawings of everything!  There are hundreds of people, buildings, vehicles, boats, and animals to draw.  And for learning how to draw, there is no better place to start than Ed Emberly!  In addition to this book he has the best series of books for learning to draw called \\"Ed Emberl's Big Green Drawing Book\\" and he has orange, red, and purple too. He also has the books on specialized items like trains, or animals, but the big books pretty much cover it all along with this one. A perfect set of books for the young artist.<br /><br />(When these books have been learned, and your artist is thinking of improving their skills they can try Mark Kistler's book next, then move on to books by Jack Hamm if they want to become a real artist someday.)<br /><br />As an adult, I still love this book.  I love it more now that it makes my son so happy that he can draw such neat things as castles, with dragons and knights in 2 minutes! A 5 year old or younger can easily draw many of the items in this book, as well as an doodle fan of any age. I give this my highest reccommendation!	2002-03-11

They show how to take your basic skills and make some neat stuff. But this book is basically 1 page to a cartoon star, and about 6 drawings on the page to get a completed look. For some simple ones it works but on others it gets a little tricky. No text instructions here, just the drawings which you are just copying. If you want to LEARN how to draw and get the basic skills first whether you are kid or an adult, the books by Jack Hamm and Ed Emberly are the best place to start. They can make anyone an artist.  Then come back to books like Ames.	2002-03-11

Amazon often posts reviews for books with the same title and author at different pages for different release years, where there can be changes in releases. This book is no exception. For example there is a fairly recent printing Army survival book with the same FM number that was republished by a major bookseller and edited for \\"civilian use\\". It is a really nice version that includes color photos and other changes, but more on that in a minute. The traditional Army Survival manual available is from the 1970's (not whatever current manual is in use as those are usually classified) and concentrates on the straightforward survival material you need to know. It is written in very accessible easy to understand language, and you do not need to be an expert in order to use this information. The material includes chapters on: Navigation and compass use; Health & Hygiene in the outdoors to prevent sickness, including first aid; Hazards in the wild to watch out for;<br />Foods and where to find them including harvesting and identifying native plants and vegetables; How to fish and tons of unusual different ways to catch them with local materials that actually work; other food from fresh water sources; Trapping mammals, rodents, reptiles, insects, catching birds, and more including how to dress and prepare these; Cooking, preserving food in the wild; methods of fire making including without matches or lighter.<br /><br />One of the most important chapters tells you how to find the most important element you need to survive. Water from Plants, digging for water, purifying found water, and building a solar water still. Other chapters include Climate and Weather, Travel, finding or building Shelter, Clothing, Health, Survival at Sea, Poisonous Snakes, signaling for help, what to do if you are lost, and much more ...<br /><br />An extremely useful book for the camper to keep in their supplies. One very nice treat... the recent bookstore reprint version differs from the 1970's surplus military version in that it offers color photos of the plants (original military version was black and white), and it is very comprehensive. While there are books available on edible and poisonous plants that are more specialized, the material here is very adequate for inclusion in this manual. All in all, one of the best books on the survival subject, well rounded and very detailed. I have a library of books on camping and camping emergencies. While one reviewer thought this book had too much info and wanted a simpler book, I would say that if you had it with you in an emergency you would be glad of its many topics. You may even want to keep a copy in the trunk of your car with your roadside tools, since you never know when you might need some help making a fire or finding water.<br /><br />Another change in the bookstore \\"civilian version\\" was the elimination of the chapters on escape and evasion that you will find in some of the 1970's copies. Again if you are buying used, be sure to query the seller which version they have. I actually have both versions and was able to compare them to review the changes. Either way, the basics on shelter, water, fire, etc are unchanged and can be very useful in the trunk of your car for emergencies. One reviewer pointed out that the manual is available for free by download, which is OK you just want to read it, that is up to you. But I think a paper copy in your emergency disaster box or in your car trunk may prove very useful when you need it. There are lots of military based survival books out there, like the pocket sized Aircrew Survival book, and they are all quite useful.per to keep in their supplies.

He has written other books on the very straitforward task of training animals, but this book is strictly a film by film list of his challenges and humerous adventures at Disney. If you ever want to know how they staged the animal race in \\"Swiss Family Robinson\\", or got the animals to interact in \\"Incredible Journey\\", or the comedies like \\"The Ugly Dachsund\\", this is the book for you.

Disney and the Creation of an EntertainmentEmpire	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Learn about the other half of the Disney team	This is a story about the half of the Disney empire that most people are not familiar with, Walt's brother Roy Disney.  And it is about Walt the creative dynamo as well, in fact sharing more details about Walt's personal life than most biographies devoted soley to him.  But don't get me wrong it is a book about Roy most of all.  These 2 brothers were very close and like all family disagreed in business at times, but they were fiercely loyal to each other always.  Each understood the others gifts and talents and they shared the load like no other team ever has.  Roy was the administrative half of Disney Studio's and Walt was in charge of the Production half.  You really get a feel for what the studio set up was like in this book.  It includes never before published photos and actual letters of correspondace from Roy that is very touching.  Roy was as unselfish a man that has ever been known, and like Walt was not dazzled by money other than its usefulness in business.  He had simple tastes and was first and foremost a family man.  You really get a feel for their times in this book and I highly reccommend it, whether you are interested in Disney, animation,televison production, theme park development, the business and administrative side of a studio,  or you just appreciate a good biography of a special person.  They broke the mold with Roy Disney.	2001-05-03

They do not candycoat him either, and the book is very fair.  First released in 1991, this book has a few really nice stories and interviews that were new to me.  It also has some of the best photos of any of the bios out there, in small b/w spread throughout the book.  The photos could be bigger though and the only big color photos were animation art rather than the other great photos that are in the book of Walt at home, play, & work.  For someone that has to have every book on Walt this should be in your library.<br /><br />If you are a diehard Disney history buff who wants a longer read after this book, then try the Bob Thomas book \\"Walt Disney an American Original\\" next or the Thomas book on Walts brother Roy Disney called \\"Building a Company\\", I could not put it down.	2001-05-03

The art is great but since the story mostly involves 2 iguanas lazing around and talking, there really was not a chance for illustrator Mark Teague to apply his wonderful upbeat inventive artwork. But if you want grand fun, check out other books that are illustrated by the illustrator of this book. He even writes some of his books too. Try, \\"The Secret Shortcut\\", \\"The Lost and Found\\", a recent great book \\"One Halloween Night\\", \\"Pigsty\\" (great at convincing anyone they should have a clean room), \\"No Moon, No Milk\\", \\"What I Did On My Summer Vacation\\", and \\"The Baby Tamer\\".

The Studio called to tell him that 700 army troops had set up camp at the Walt Disney studio campus, in order to protect the nearby airfield.  The long war hurt the Disney company many way, including the loss of key staff to the armed forces, reduction in commercial output and attendance, and cuts in overseas theatrical releases of their films.  Despite these issues that could have caused resentment of the wars interference in Disney growth and success, the company dove in to do their part to support the war effort.<br /><br />Whether it was in producing great war time comedy animated shorts such as \\"Der Fuhreres Face\\" to keep up the public morale; or educational films to teach soldiers how to operate a certain weapon or avoid disease; or deeply researched theory films like \\"Victory Through Airpower\\"; or animated shorts that promoted war bonds... the studio worked overtime to do their part.<br /><br />But one of the most personal efforts they produced, free of charge, was the design of original artistic logos for the troops. These were used on individual planes, tanks, and ships. They also helped draft designs for organized armoured units, air wings and squadrons, infantry units and others.<br /><br />This book chronicles the war effort by the studio, the tremendous cost the war had on the studio and setback on their growth as they suffered along with the rest of America. The beautiful color photos reproduce the actual designs in page after page of color photos. A wonderful book for the Disneyphile, OR for those that are interested in unit design artwork from planes, etc. from WWII.<br /><br />If you want to see the actual logos they made, the book \\"Disney Dons Dogtags: The Best of Disney Military Insignia from World War II\\" focuses on that aspect of the Disney war effort and features more of the actual logos than any other.<br /><br />I highly reccomend and give 5 stars.	2001-04-23
