Not that this book lacks for the ususal King suspense and gore.     Reunited, the gunslingers take us to places unseen before.   Though the final installment isn't one of my favorites, it's still mandatory reading if you've been following the story.   My main fascination with the last three novels has been the question of Roland and Jake.   Would Roland betray Jake once more?   The answer is only implied, but like the final scene, the Crimson King and the mysterious Tower-- it's open to speculation.    I've really enjoyed this epic and it's interesting to see it evolve into something unexpected.  My sense is that some of these characters will show up in future King stories, though it seems to be the final story for Roland.       Long days and pleasant nights.	2005-07-29

The mechanics of this story are admirable, and it's one of the first things I liked about it.  Later, the characters drew my full respect and sympathy into the story.<br /><br />I've found some of the Today's Show books too dark for my taste, but the Time Traveler's Wife, although definitely not for kids was a very enjoyable read.	2005-02-26

I haven't eaten fast food in over a month after reading this book, but doubt the effect will linger much longer-the industry is simply to pervasive and that's part of the point.   Fast Food Nation is an eye-opening read, more bias than traditional non-fiction, and full of interesting, and unappetizing information.  The internal memos on essentially brainwashing their youngest customers in order to manipulate parents and grandparents, the shrewd business arrangements with suppliers and schools, the gory details of the meat industry are all too hard to forget.  Even the history of the major franchises is told in an interesting and engaging manner.       It's not exactly science but would be an interesting book for high school classes to study.	2005-02-14

With style and simplicity Garland writes on the nature of conscious and dreams without derailing the story.   After the momentum of the questions raised in Coma, the conclusion seems somewhat misplaced to me.   <br /> <br />(Grasping the ending takes the minimal effort of decoding the last sentences.

After a bizarre deathbed prediction of \\"five terrible days\\" for newborn Jimmy Tock, the story jumps immediately to Jimmy at twenty and the first of the ominous days.  Life Expectancy shows only the advent and drama of each of the days, but there's nothing sketchy about the oddball characters who seem to thrive on the unique pacing of this story.  Without foregoing suspense, Koontz has written a pretty good non-gory novel.<br /><br />While his other recent books have (sometimes infectively) explored philosophical angles or theological themes, this one's simply a good story.  Typically his villains are unrealistic, but these are far from Koontz worst in that area.	2005-02-14

Again Wilson has a truly unique concept - quarantine (for unknown reasons) at a research community observing alien life on a distant planet.   The story has many angles - cosmic justice, technological mysteries and limitations, personal dramas, and scientific ethics.   <br /> <br />Tensions rise during the months-long siege at Blind Lake which ends abruptly after much suspense.  I think the best parts of this story lie more in the middle of the tale than in its conclusion.  Not that the outcome is disappointing (in fact it's quite unpredictable) but it doesn't seem to be the focus.  Since many science fiction stories take the opposite approach, this one's a pleasant switch. <br /> <br />	2004-12-21

I enjoy his writing style (as always).  Most of the anecdotes he includes in the autobiographical section you've probably read before if you're a huge fan, but they're still interesting and do include some new material.   The surprise for me in this book was Stephen King's opinions of other writers... not what I would have expected.   (Many he adores, and a few he deplores.)   <br /> <br />King writes about his accident and injuries here realistically, in contrast to the fantastical way he uses the incident in the final Dark Tower book.  (On Writing may help put things in perspective for anyone who wonders if King is channeling mid-world as the last few novels in that series have implied.  It's a comforting switch, since the world of the gunslingers has become quite a disturbing place.) <br />	2004-12-21

While I really enjoyed the The Talisman, the first joint venture between Stephen King and Peter Straub, I found Black House tedious to read.   Mainly it's the writing style that detracts from this story. Containing second person passages throughout, it's unique, but not as readable you'd expect from King. <br /> <br />The elements of the tale are Dean-Koonish-gory: a child-eating killer plagues a small community, and a gifted detective is reluctant to take on the case until the strange events around him force him into it.  Ultimately the murders take on cosmic significance.   (For Dark Tower fans, Black House offers more insight into the Crimson King and workings of the multi-worlds than the first six books in the series.) <br /> <br />A well-educated gang of motorcyclists adds color to the story, along with a somewhat inept police force and a blind radio personality.   It's not a bad story (and would make a pretty good movie) but I can't think of another King story that took so long to finish.    <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-20

Neanderthal is an engaging and suspenseful story that would seem to make for a fascinating movie.  (It's loaded with dramatic and imaginative visuals.)  It takes an interesting premise, the existence of modern Neanderthals, and transcends the typical survival struggle with its own myths and a bit of philosophy.  The story is fast paced throughout with better than average characters for this type of thriller.  <br /> <br />Written in 1996, one drawback is Neanderthal's setting-- in the supposedly obscure and unknown mountains of Afghanistan.   As infamous as the country has become, Afghanistan, as a setting, is unfortunately a jarring distraction.    <br />	2004-10-20

The sixth Dark Tower book propels the story to a new level - one with a very blurred line between the story and reality.    The gunslingers move from Mid-World into New York in 1999 and Maine in 1977.    The New York group battles Mia who is attempting to turn over Susannah's baby to a group of vampires. As Mia and Susannah struggle for control of the body they share on multiple levels and in multiple realms, we learn much more about the women, the baby, the beams and Roland's world.   <br /> <br />The Maine group has to survive a brutal ambush and acquire a piece of land from Calvin Tower that harbors a precious rose.  While in Maine Roland and Eddie meet their creator (it seems), Stephen King, at the stage when he's only written, but not published, the first book in this series.  The meeting is masterful and the highlight of this book, but it seems Stephen King's character doesn't have the role to play in this world that we may have first expected.   In King's \\"journal\\" at the end of Song of Susannah he writes, \\"I can see now how, to a greater or lesser degree, every story I've ever written is about this story.\\"   (If that tantalizes you into reading the fifteen other King stories related to the Dark Tower series, there's a list in the front of the book of ones not to miss.)  <br /> <br />Although I prefer the more intact stories like Wizard and the Glass and Wolves of the Calla, the cliffhanger at the end of this book beats the rest of them for suspense and give plenty to ponder.    I can't wait for the next!   <br />     <br />	2004-08-17

Of course, this is not one of Stephen King's masterpieces; it is designed mainly to promote the Kingdom Hospital tv series.  (I would rather read the rest of the story than watch it, but only this journal has been published so far.)    Initially I found the Sally/Eleanor Druse character un-engaging, however midway through the story I became fully fascinated.   The story is one worth reading and seems to work on different levels:  the current hospital bureaucracy, the strange suicide attempts, an evil spirit, and lobotomies on children.   It ends abruptly and unresolved, but sets up the tv show nicely.	2004-07-16

(A weak novel from Stephen King beats many other authors best works, however I hold King to higher standards.) <br />The conflict between a battered wife and her sociopath husband seems somewhat Dean Koontzish or movieish to me and the characters lack the complexity of a Carrie, Jack Torrance or even the Trashcan Man.  The first half of the story contains all its best parts (And the drama and emotion in those chapters are exceptional!) after that it seems unnecessarily long.   Delores Claiborne and Gerald's Game share similar themes with Rose Madder, but contain better stories.  <br />King's descriptions are more than readable, of course, making the story move along at a nice pace as it draws you in and he even keeps you reading when there's little doubt as to how this book will end.  It's not a bad book, just not one of Stephen King's best.	2004-07-08

I enjoyed this Delaware story more than most of them, maybe because I'd quit reading them for a while.   With Robin and Spike out of the picture, and the added focus on Milo Sturgis' early years as a police officer, The Murder Book offers new insight to this series. <br />The mystery itself is engaging --- a violent unsolved case, one of Milo's first homicide investigations, comes back to haunt the detective via The Murder Book.  It all ends with a lot of drama and secrets revealed, just like a great book should.	2004-06-12

You'll hate your job a little less after reading &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; by Lauren Weisberger.  Thankfully, Weisberger avoids the gimmicks and clich?s that turn me off of this genre.   &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; is a blistering but entertaining view of fashion publishing.  Discovering Miranda Priestly, the world's worst boss, is reason enough to read this book.    By some miracle, the monstrous Miranda doesn't overshadow the rest of Devil's characters: Andrea our narrator, her friends outside of The Fashion Publishing Industry, Miranda's latest junior assistant, and a staff of--- not sure what you'd call them - terrified cronies all with a love-hate relationship with Miranda.<br />I'd love to see this make it to a film version and can't wait to read something else from this author.

While I always love John Grisham's style, I think The Last Juror contains one of his better plots.  The characters and setting of Floyd County, Mississippi in the 1970's are both fascinating and real.  More goes on in this small town than you would expect: murder, bribery, conspiracy, segregation, and real desegregation.

The Secret History is like a horrifically twisted &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; and it's the best book I've read all year.

Personally I like his unique style and I like his perspective.  This book, like his others, is a fast read.  It covers everything from the Pope to Jennifer Lopez.  However, a few of his opinions get too \\"pithy\\" in this one, sometimes they read like drive-by attacks which don't include the full background story on either side. <br />Bill offer advice--loads of it-- gathered from his rise in the television news industry and life in general.  He's got an interesting story, he fesses up to a number of professional errors and you'll have a finer appreciation of him \\"making it\\" at last when you reach the end of this book.    <br />Ironically O'Reilly, though he has at times been pretty critical of Dr. Phil, has written parts of \\"Whose Looking Out for You?\\" as if it's a self-help book.  I like them both but perhaps the two of them are just too much alike to get along. <br />Having read all of his books, I think \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\" had the most meat in it.  This one's a step below that but still smart, still enjoyable, enlightening and worthwhile.	2004-02-02

His longer stories seem to always lose momentum.  \\"Odd Thomas\\" though, is a fast read filled with quirky characters, a unique setting and some insights into Koontz's take on society, culture and writing if you're alert to them. <br />Odd Thomas is an interesting, likeable character, (similar to Chris Snow from Seize the Night and Fear Nothing but I like Oddie even better.)   Odd sees dead people, brings justice to their killers when he can and fries burgers for a living when he can't.   For a switch this time, the hero is a lot more interesting than the villains.   Odd's got a tender/tough girlfriend to deal with, a fatherly police chief to aid, dysfunctional parents to figure out and the spirit of Elvis lending an enigmatic hand. <br />The other highlights of this book are the unpredictable story, the insight into Thomas' family life which is effective but not overdone, and some of the bizarre qualities of the small town of Pico Mundo.   <br />I think there's another story in this Odd Thomas, but I'm glad Koontz didn't try to drag this one out.   It's a great read as is, better than most of his recent novels, and more like the classic Koontz.	2004-02-01

Stephen King's fans who don't read the Dark Tower series are really missing out.   The \\"Wolves of Calla\\" is an impressive, well-written, story that raises questions King has been giving us in other works and ties in one of his very first stories in a unique way.   <br />The suspense and drama of the books are fantastic, but I think it's the characters that really set this series apart.  In \\"Wolves of the Calla\\", each member of the ka-tet has agonizing personal choices to make and their decisions, sometimes flawed, sometimes heroic, make this series something beyond classification.  This isn't a drawn-out epic fantasy or a gimmicky tie in of other novels.   Like \\"Wizard and the Glass\\" this novel is memorable both in itself and in what is does for the series storyline.  <br />Jake is growing up.   The Gunslinger is growing a heart (has been for some time).  He's also losing some of his physical abilities, but he's a much more interesting character than when he started out.  Susannah's latest personality would defy belief if written by any other writer, but Stephen King handles her masterfully.    And Eddie the former junkie is now the one that's desperate to hold the group together.  The battle to project a town's children against seemingly unstoppable &quot;wolves&quot; is just one part of the story. <br />The stakes are raised at the conclusion of this installment by a new character with his own stunning background added to mix and Stephen King tantalizes us with the first real glimpse of how this serious might conclude.   I hate the spoilers, so that's all I'll say.  <br />Don't miss it.	2004-01-25

Koontz's other recent novels have streched my patience due to their weak stories, bland characters and overall poor editing but I don't have the same criticisms about The Face.  The Face is a return to form that very effectively covers some new territory. <br />The story spans just a few days before Christmas in modern California and is balanced with a genuine borderline character, neither saintly nor demonic, who gives this novel an extra dimension. <br />I enjoyed the unpredictable plot so I don't want to spoil it for anyone.

Blackwood Farm suffers from having far too much in some aspects and far too little in others.  What's lacking are the suspense, mystery and great storytelling of  \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" and \\"The Witching Hour\\".   What's over-indulgent are the many characters from other Anne Rice novels awkwardly thrust in.   (Even the most fascinating characters can become annoying when they water down the main story and force the author into convoluted explanations of their backgrounds.) Unless you're greatly impressed with the gimmick of piecing all the details together, Lestat and the Mayfairs detract from Blackwood Farm more than they contribute.    <br />Another problem is the narrator, Quinn, whose flowery dialog makes him seem out of place even in his own story, which is set in the modern world of email and AIDs.   The character and the setting just don't match up.    Neither do his actions.  Halfway through the novel he makes some extremely bizarre choices that really shattered my belief in the entire story.      <br />Set back a few decades, the story of Quinn and Goblin might have been a good one, but it seems to have been abandoned midway through in favor of cameo appearances by more famous Rice characters and an ending designed to set up another book.    Blackwood Farm reads like an unintended parody of Anne Rice's better novels.	2003-02-23
US	50910460	R289GACPC9BA0N	0066214122	245555180	Prey	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Great Suspense!	For two days, I could barely put this book down. This time Crichton's plot revolves around nano computers and an unemployed father of three, Jack, who believes his wife is having an affair. Jack's real problems begin the instant his infant daughter wakes up screaming in the night from a mysterious rash but in short order he's called upon to save the world from uncontrollable swarms of deadly nano computers. (Luckily Jack's an unemployed computer code writer, and it's his code on predator and prey behavior that the tiny computers are running on.) <BR> <BR>Prey reminds me both of The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park, with a great balance of story and science. The concepts in Prey are quite realistic and terrifying and the suspense in the last half of the book is incredible. (Plus, Michael Crichton was years ahead of his time with the misuse of cloning theme used in Jurassic Park, so I think that adds an element of credibility to his ideas.) <br />I admit that there are a couple of too convenient contrivances, and the ultimate outcome is somewhat sudden and movie-ish (Without a doubt there will be a movie version) but Prey remains a great story. I enjoyed it immensely and can't wait for Crichton's next!	2003-02-17

I hate to admit this but after finishing Ubik I have no idea what point Philip K. Dick was making with the conclusion of this story.  (Though I've since then learned that he himself considered it one of his most important works.)   <br />Ubik contains many very interesting developments and some tangents you know no one but Philip K. Dick would explore.   My favorites include the idea that death can be defeated entirely and society may someday spin the pay-per-view mentality ridiculously out of control.  Written in 1969, Ubik is just another example of Mr. Dick's advanced insight.  <br />There is suspense right up until the end, and the hope of finally understanding \\"what's really going on\\" is tantalizing; if only I understood the ending this would be one of my favorites.  <br />As always, reading any Philip K. Dick novel is truly an eye-opening and unique experience.  If you like them hilarious and bizarre, you'll enjoy reading Ubik much more than once.	2003-01-30
US	50910460	R2KHM7L4E8WTS6	0679752986	865862753	A Maze of Death	Books	5	5	5	N	N	This one's good! Short but with amazing insight!	Realistic characters (all human this time), genuine suspense, a strange and oddly familiar view of religion and a really well handled twist at the end - for those reasons A Maze of Death is one of my favorite Philip K. Dick novels. It's a short book, but packs in a lot of insight about perceptions, the shifting nature of reality (of course), human interactions, paranoia and hopeless cases. I notice that the tone here is more dismal than Philip K. Dick usually offers, but (as always with his stories) reading it is an eye-opening and memorable experience. <br />While many authors have expanded on themes in this story, written in 1970, I don't think that anyone's improved on his presentation of them. Read it with your mind open to all possibilities.	2003-01-30
US	50910460	R12BGBC8NUG3MO	0812545249	536696611	The Chronoliths	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Smart and Original Speculative Fiction	I think Robert Charles Wilson is one of the most under-recognized writers in science fiction and that this is one of his best novels. Set in the not-too-distant future, this story hits very close to home. Wilson's writing makes the unfathomable appearance of magnificent monuments from the future seem thoroughly plausible. <br />The chronoliths reveal most (but not all) of their secrets within the framework of an engaging mystery with characters that are interesting and well defined. The narrator, Scott, has a strong, likeable presence throughout and gives the story a unique insight. I wish more writers would attempt to be as original and handle such challenging material. <br />Some of the most compelling questions raised in this novel are how 21st century civilizations would accept their certain defeat and what the complex relationships are between cause and effect. <br />The Chronoliths focuses much more on the political, sociological, and psychological ramifications of future technology than strictly science, making it seem more like classical science fiction than most current sci-fi novels. (In my own opinion it's a very welcomed switch.)	2003-01-29

The characters are fascinating, the human element of the story truly inspiring, the conclusion radical and eye-opening and it's written on a level anyone can understand. <br />Sagan's writing conceptualizes science without sacrificing an enjoyable story. Open minded readers will appreciate the symbolism and irony absent in the film version as skeptics becomes believers and the tables turn on the debate between science and religion. <br />You won't be disappointed. The ending in &quot;Contact&quot; is the most surprising and satisfying that I've ever read. It really gets you thinking about the universe, it's origin and our place in it.	2003-01-27

Worlds of Wonder starts out like a lot of other books of this type, but after the first few chapters you'll find some really useful and specific advice.  My favorite sections are those on writing in E-prime (shunning the passive verb &quot;to be&quot;), writing in the discomfort zone, making critical distinctions and creating powerful paragraphs.  Gerrod has two long chapters on fantasy and alien world building which I found useful even though I'm not a fan of fantasy worlds.   <br />I like Gerrold's style.  It's easy to follow and entertaining.   Yes, it seems self indulgent when he uses his own examples in every chapter but he's also a big fan of classic science fiction and uses Robert Heinlein, Theodore Sturgeon and others for balance. <br />This is a really superb book.  Writers outside of science fiction could benefit from the advice, but I'm glad to see it focusing on science fiction.  <br />Gerrold offers writers a great deal of insight and enthusiam.  My favorite line comes near the end, &quot;If you haven't written a million words, it's all practice.&quot;	2002-11-17

Don't hold out for the film version-- this story one will never be made into one, though it's one of Philip K. Dick's most interesting and bizarre novels. <br />The story begins on a freedom-challenged earth of the future and travels to a distant planet where an oddly limited godlike being is on a mission to resurrect a mythological city. Between the variety of aliens, the psychics and their book of sometimes misleading predictions, the (supposedly) living dead, and the ambiguous \\"god\\" and his evil counterpart, this is more a religious allegory story than science fiction or fantasy (as Dick's work is sometimes mislabeled) and it raises a lot of questions. <br />Philip K. Dick's symbolic story veers miles away from the comfortable good versus evil and faith versus fear struggles other authors offer. (Remember this is the guy who for years received messages from God and/or aliens through a pink beam of light.) There's no tidy ending here, but as always it's the ideas and their implications that are the heart of Philip K. Dick's novels. Those will remain with your long after the story is over.	2002-10-18

Yes, these characters and stories stay with you long after the book is finished, but that's that not necessarily a good thing, particularly his story about an abusive homosexual relationship between teenage boys. There are literary merits to this collection--fascinating characters, unique and memorable stories and a exciting, creative style, however those are all overshadowed by the graphic and disturbing nature of at least one of his stories. That's something I never expected to find in a new writer's first collection of short stories (The publicity and dust jacket give no indication of it.) or in a book promoted by a national morning television show.

Dick!	Reading this book is like sitting down to a one-on-one conversation with Philip K. Dick. His unique and surprisingly upbeat personality shines though more here than in any biography. Despite personal trials and delusions Philip K. Dick retained a sense of humor and it's fascinating to hear that come through in his own words. I appreciate the fragmented sentences and \\"and um's\\" left intact because they truly convey the atmosphere of being in a room listing to Philip K. Dick.  One of the most interesting things about reading this book is seeing Philip K. Dick's momentum and thought progression as he plots out a story idea (tragically one that he never had time to finish.) His interpretation of the well-known interferences in his life from either extraterrestrial or divine sources is fascinating but somewhat brief, it seems not to overshadow his existence, but merely become another accepted aspect of it.   This book brings this sci-fi legend into human terms.  For those interested in Philip K. Dick's personality this book is probably the most authentic and enlightening available.	2002-07-27

Again, Koontz has too many contrived situations (especially at the conclusion) the characters are unrealistic, and the dialog unnatural. <br />The extraterrestrial elements of this story are overshadowed by the psychopathic ones and the evil stepfather is one of Koontz's least original killers.  This book might have been better in a shorter version and could have been much improved by editing out the attempts at clever description that quickly become annoying. (The dog is called \\"furry companion\\" and everything other than dog through most of the book.)  There are too many characters and too many random tangents that come together even less effectively here than in \\"From The Corner Of His Eye.\\"  <br />It bothered me that little resourceful Lelilani overlooks a quite simple avenue of escape -- leave the license plate number in the restaurant bathroom.

It's actually better than most other books on writing out there today.  Read it with your highlighter to capture some really helpful and inspiring advice.   This is one you'll want to own.	2002-07-25
US	50910460	R2PT7T29YH393I	0451191153	594264062	The Fountainhead	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Fascinating insight into American society - a classic	Ayn Rand's fascinating and complex characters and her insight into American society are what make \\"The Fountainhead\\" such a powerful classic.   Though it contains some out-dated themes, the timeless story of one man's vision and integrity in the face of impossible obstacles is still profound and enjoyable over a half a century after it was written.     <br />Ayn Rand's descriptions are mesmerizing but she is never much of a romantic. The love story angle is weaker here than in \\"Atlas Shrugged\\".   While Dominique may seem unrealistic and difficult to identify, the story's main character, the unbendable, unbreakable Howard Roark, will always remain one of the most memorable in American literature. <br />There is an interesting side note about this novel-- Rand's inspiration for Roark, Frank Lloyd Wright, refused to ever meet the famous author despite several attempts on her part, a typically Howard Roark thing to do.	2002-07-25

Anne Rice is a unique, imaginative and fantastic writer and The Witching Hour is her best novel.  The visual descriptions, fascinating characters and rich history will obsess (and disturb) you long after you finish the book.   Her later books in this series fall short in comparision, but this one is truly a masterpiece.	2002-07-25

If not yet a fan, you'll probably find it interesting and entertaining.  &quot;The O'Reilly Factor: The Good The Bad and the Completely Ridiculous.&quot; surpasses this one on the content scale.	2002-07-25

Before and after the birth, almost every conceivable question is addressed.  You could buy ten other pregnancy books and still not cover everything in this one.	2002-07-25

Atlas Shrugged lives up to it's reputation as one of the greatest books of all time.  It's long, but well worth it. The story of man overcoming immense and realistic obstacles is intriguing, the characters fascinating and the writing exceptional.  Ayn Rand's famous philosophy often overshadows the literary merits of this book.  It's not just for Objectivists but anyone who appreciates great writing.	2002-07-25

It's a wild, weird, quick read that is a great introduction to Philip K. Dick for someone who wants to jump into the fanaticism headfirst. Those not quite ready for complete immersion in the reality shattering world of Philip K. Dick should look at \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" or \\"Time Out Of Joint\\" and then read \\"Clans\\", but don't skip this one. It's a real joy to read. Philip K. Dick's death is our loss!	2002-07-25

In each of her stories the depression era south is vividly depicted in a unique, concise and impactful style.  Each character is uniquely and realistically flawed and the scenerios are almost without exception tragic, and still reading her words is a truly delightful experience. For anyone interested in writing fiction these short stories are great inspiration.	2002-07-25

Here the philosophical angles supercede the scientific ones, which is a welcome switch from most current science fiction and a great treat for fans of classic sci-fi.	2002-07-25
US	50910460	R3IDXIJO8ZDMFH	0671004107	860650224	Contact	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Very realistic science fiction	The performances are excellent and the scenes memorable. Though  the filmed version lacks the key points in Sagan's novel,  Contact is one of the most realistic science fiction films ever produced with many real newscasters (almost too many, at times)lending their hands.  Aside from its special effects and mysteries revealed, Contact presents a very believable story of<BR>worldwide reactions to the discovery of life beyond.  <br />I strongly recommend the novel to anyone interested in this topic.   Reading the book is well worth the time.	2002-07-25

Even though it's fairly short, this book contains many situations and themes left out of the film version. Some of the most fascinating aspects of the novel are the future civilization's politics, religion, and standards of society. Many unexpected things happen and the outcome is a real surprise (the hunt for the androids seems to be a minor sub-plot. The main issues are much more intriguing.)  This is one of Philip K. Dick's most interesting and coherent novels.	2002-04-29

Some of my ojections are the extended time frame and number of characters, all of which are either too evil or good to seem real, and tragedies that seem contrived only to maximize emotion.	2002-04-29

The premise is very frightening. A little bird spends the entire book searching for his mother and comes face to face with a pretty scary \\"snort\\". He does end up reunited with his mom in the end, but the main storyline plants the seeds for plenty of nightmares and anxiety. There are many better children's books out there.	2001-11-29
