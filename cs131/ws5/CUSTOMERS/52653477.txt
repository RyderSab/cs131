If you want a book that teaches you how to be a part of the pack, have dogs that love and respect you, and have impecably behaved dogs this is a great book.  We have THREE large dogs, all raised (in general) under similar principles.  The book teaching that &quot;training&quot; a dog is not 30 min at the park 3 times a week, but how we interact with them on a day to day basis.  This includes being consistant at all times and INCLUDING the dogs as part of the family (NOT just tossed in a kennel in the back yard).  Because they are well behaved, our dogs can do with us anywhere, lay down and stay outside a bookstore, hike in the woods without splitting and be wonderful companions to be around. We are able to have people over to the house who are afraid of dogs (since the dogs will LISTEN and go lay down, not jump on people) and they really are part of the family.  Yes, the &quot;roll over&quot; can definately be abused and should only be used for MAJOR disiplinary actions.  Since we have three dogs, we get to watch &quot;pack&quot; behavior on a regular basis.  I challenge someone who says natural dog behavior does not include &quot;roll over&quot; to watch a group of dogs at liberty.  New dogs, young dogs and dogs that step out of line end up with a mouth at their neck.  The bottom line is there are certain behaviors that can lead to problems that are dangerous for people but more importantly the dog.  Somehow they HAVE to learn that behaviors like biting or raising a lip are NEVER the answer.	2004-01-10
US	52653477	R2WBR0T0MMH29N	0936184388	360661070	The Best Recipe	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Great for cooking and learning	This is not your average cook book.  Each &quot;recipe&quot; starts off with an explaination of what the authors were looking for from a standard recipe (like, cooking a quiche for example).  Then they give a couple of base recipes for that item, then off to some modifications.  It also explains what to do to get the best results (how to add ingredients, what temp is best etc) and why.  Not only will the food taste great, but you will learn WHY to cook a certain way and HOW to start making up recipes of your own if you want.  Great book, all of the pages of ours are starting to get sticky from use!  Definately worthwhile and a great gift for cooks.	2003-08-13

Beautifully told and deserves to be reread and reread.  The story talks of race, of strife, but mostly of life and the little things that happen (and big things) and change how we see the world.  Really is one of those books that everyone should read at some point in their life.	2003-08-13

However, it is enjoyable and more inventive.  The use of different voices is surprisingly easy to follow and gives the story multiple perspectives.  The first part of the book is slow, painful, and a bit dogmatic.  The father's character is so over the top, he is hard to take.  But HANG ON, the second half picks up and the characters become more real.	2003-08-13

Similar format to the Best Recipe book in the many tests were done for the best recipe.  Included are not only recipes, but ideas for modifications, how to turn over a bird that is cooking, and what flavors go well together.  This was a gift to my husband and I - we have used it a great deal find it helpful for everything from ideas to practical questions.  A great gift for cooks.	2003-08-13

His view of life (esp in regard to the main female character) was SO offensive and sexist, I threw the book across the room several times.  I wish I had never read it so I did not know how far his views on women and there place went.  I guess according to him the largest sin of a women is to be independent and get a job.

Everyone that I have recommended this book to has enojoyed it and found it useful.  Covers concepts making them easy to understand without \\"dumbing down\\" the scientific background.  I have one copy at home and one in the lab to loan out.  A must have for any teaching laboratory, especially if you have people with non-molecular biology backgrounds (our lab does applied genetic work and has people with ecology and conservation biology backgrounds starting conservation genetics/population genetics projects).  Was a great review for me at the start of graduate school and a fun read.	1998-10-04

The underlying plot of love, adultery and quests in the dessert called to my heart and I longed to read the &quot;real story&quot;. <br />What I found was the movie represented the book - for once- at its downfall.  In order to have a &quot;vilian&quot; as the main character, the reader must connent with him.  I did not.  I wanted to, I wanted to see one redeaming quality revealed.  I searched a searched to be only dissapointed.<br /> The images are beautiful, the writing poetic and inticing.  One can smell dry air and taist the sand in one's teeth.  But the characters are 2-dimentional, emotionally flat and did not &quot;captive the soul&quot;.  This is not a book that kept me awake at night, mulling over details.<br />I recommend The English Patient overall, it is worth the read.  Don't expect to gain intimacy with the characters.	1998-06-16

I read Midnight with little expectation, but I was  sucked in after two pages.  I laughed aloud and annoyed the family, even the tragedy of the novel is told with a good dose of humor.  However, if you are easily offened, this is not the book for you (sex, murder and night clubs included)!  Great read for a rainy vacation week and those of us with a sense of humor that is a little off.  One of my new favs!	1998-06-15

If you liked James Joyce (which I do NOT), you will love this book.  <br />My overriding problem was the chopy writing style considered sophisticated and &quot;cool&quot; by up and coming writers.  As a reader, I find it distracting and anoying.  <br />Once I got past the stylistic white-caps, I found the book to be educational and enjoyable.  I recommend this book, especially to the older audience (there is adult material).  I hope you laugh, and cry, with Frank and his family.	1998-06-15
