Pearson we knew and  <br />loved.  A Short History of a Small Place featured Louis Benfield, <br />and the writing was narrative and rambled--no fast-food here, you  <br />had to take the sentences slowly and lovingly--brilliant small- <br />town dialogue.  The Benfield-less Blue Ridge had some parts that <br /> took place in New York, and which lacked the charm and delight  <br />of the parts involving small-town life.  Glad News is mostly New <br /> York:the writing is good, but not great, Louis Benfield is now <br /> grown up, sentences are more compact, less rambling. <br /> <br />The novel reminded me, strangely, of a non-fiction book \\"The <br />Last Serious Thing\\" about a summer of watching bullfighting in <br />Spain.  One of the matadors was aging, and no longer very  <br />enjoyable to watch--EXCEPT!--that perhaps once every 50 or 100 <br />fights he would have a bull he would like, and you would then <br />see real brilliance and a breathtaking performance.  So the <br />afficionados would endure poor perormance after poor performance <br />in the hope of seeing the old unforgettable form.  In Glad News <br />the writing is good, but not memorable (as with Short History) <br />until suddenly you see a flash of the old brilliance, a stunning <br />series of passes, a breathtaking faena, to use the bullfight <br />analogy. When you read these, you want to leap out of your seat, <br />scream OLE!! with tears running down your face, so to speak. <br />\\"Not much trace of the wide world had actually penetrated Neely. <br />We had an altogether deplorable Chinese restaurant on the bypass <br />where they tried to compensate with cornstarch for what they <br />lacked in cooking skill, and there was a sort of a taco shack <br />out near the public pool which got by on corrupted adaptations <br />like pulled-pork enchiladas, dirty chowchow, and refried black- <br />eyed peas.\\"  It's passages such as this which make Glad Newsa <br />fine novel. <br /> <br />The ending is downbeat.  I realize that not all of life is like <br />Short History, and in real life there must be the downbeat  <br />parts--but a lot of the enjoyment in the Pearson novels is to <br />read slowly, savor the writing, let it roll around on your  <br />tongue, and escape into a world that helps you forget the  <br />downbeat side of real life for a while.  Still--the book is <br />enjoyable to read, and there are the raisins in the pudding <br />to nibble on, so to speak.	2005-10-03

If you enjoyed Christopher Moore's Coyote Blue, you should also  <br />enjoy Anansi Boys.  Both books are lighthearted and whimsical, and <br />both center on a trickster god--one of many gods:  a spider god in <br />Gaiman, and a coyote god in Moore.  Gaiman's American Gods is a <br />much darker novel.  This is a milieu where humans and gods <br />interact--not an all-powerful God of the Bible, but less  <br />powerful and more personal gods who you might go to lunch with, <br />or who might have you for lunch.  In this milieu you might bump into  <br />Hopi, Navajo, Norse, etc gods. <br /> <br />In Anansi Boys the hero, Fat Charlie Nancy, learns that his  <br />father Anansi was the spider god, and that his brother (who he <br />never knew he had) inherited some of their father's powers. <br />As with Coyote Blue, this god enjoys a good joke, although <br />Coyote's tastes tended to be more prurient.  In both novels, <br />hanging out with a god presents some problems, and this is what <br />makes both novels particularly enjoyable.   <br /> <br />As with Coyote Blue, Anansi Boys is--to be blunt--a lot of fun. <br />As with Coyote Blue, after about 30-40 pages, you know that you <br />are going to hang onto the book and enjoy reading it again in <br />a year or so.	2005-09-26

Yet, paradoxically, the British won the battle that  month.  Bloody April goes into depth on the characteristics  of the aircraft, the training, the prelude to April and the  aftermath:  there are innumerable quotes from diaries,  letters home, and other accounts that help show the attitudes  and the stress.    The romantic view of the war in the air in W.W. I is usually  that of single-seat fighters in combat with each other.  The  reality is that for the RFC in the Arras sector, only a third  of the aircraft were single-seaters:  the rest were all two-  seaters, although some of these had to be employed as fighters  at times.  The primary mission of the RFC was to help with  photo reconnaissance (thousands of photographs had to be taken  each day) and artillery spotting (using wireless transmitters  to help artillery zero in on targets).  The primary role of the  fighters was to escort the photo recon and artillery spotting  aircraft and to screen them by offensive patrols.  Trench-  strafing, anti-balloon attacks, and bombing were of secondary  importance, as was the need to prevent photo recon and artillery  spotting by the Germans.    The German fighters were far superior to almost all of the  British two-seaters, and were superior to most of the British  fighters, but the Germans had only half as many aircraft in  the sector as the British, and so they usually played a   defensive role.  The British accepted very heavy losses in  exchange for getting the photographs and the artillery  spotting done.  There are quotes about how a squadron with  32 planes lost 35 pilots during April--replacement pilots   would survive only a few days.  Flying a BE2 with only 10 hours'  flying experience against veteran German pilots whose planes  were twice as fast and had twice the firepower was not  conducive to lasting very long.      Bloody April never gets bogged down in small details--it gives  a first-class flavor to what things were really like, and it   helps dispell the romantic myths.  It's a fine book.    addendum:  august, 2007.  Aces Falling by Peter Hart (available Amazon UK  august, USA October?) carries the air war through 1918--it's a good sequel  to Bloody April.	2005-07-04
US	52519625	R32Y7ONNDD4PK	0345461347	258301458	To the Last Man: A Novel of the First World War	Books	2	11	27	N	N	pedestrian	I had some good hopes for this novel of WW I.  The book's cover  <br />art and title implied an emphasis on trench warfare, but the  <br />trench warfare in the novel is minimal at best.  The book centers  <br />on four people:  pilots Lufberry and Richthofen, General  <br />Pershing, and US Marine private Roscoe Temple.  The parts about  <br />Lufberry and Richthofen are passable, but not memorable.  The  <br />parts dealing with Pershing and the politics were the most  <br />interesting and original, and the parts about Roscoe Temple were  <br />the least interesting.   <br /> <br />The essence of land warfare in WW I was the war in the trenches <br />where lines were very static and gains were measured in yards <br />rather than hundreds of miles of even miles.  In the Western <br />Front, fluidity and mobility were seen only at the start and end <br />of the war, when gains were sometimes substantial.  On most of <br />the other fronts, such as Italy and Gallipoli, trench warfare <br />was also the norm.  In the air and at sea, and on land in some <br />locations such as East Africa, there was much greater movement <br />and fluidity.  Roscoe Temple is the novel's vehicle (so to <br />speak) for WW I land warfare.  The battles fought by American <br />forces in 1918 were far from characteristic of the static trench <br />warfare that epitomized the Western Front from late 1914 to <br />early 1918--those battles had much greater movement and gains. <br />As I read the parts about Temple my thought was that with very <br />minimal changes, the battle scenes could have been the US Civil <br />War, the Boer War, WW II, Korea, etc.  There is no sense of the <br />almost surrealistically grim life of trench warfare. <br /> <br />For most readers, mobility is much more exciting than the  <br />terrible trench warfare where in some battles hundreds of <br />thousands of lives might be lost for a gain of 200 yards.  Air <br />warfare is exciting, if you are reading aboutfighter pilots <br />and are oblivious to the fact that the British lost many more <br />pilots in training accidents than in combat. <br /> <br />It may be argued that the book is about Americans (if you ignore <br />Richthofen and that Lufberry was much more French than American) <br />and hence the emphasis should be on the battles fought by <br />American forces.  But just as Lufberry was not part of the <br />American forces through most of his war, it would have been <br />easy to have an Anglo-American (or French-American) fighting in <br />the trenches in 1916. <br /> <br />Some suggested alternatives for WW I: <br />Leadership:  CS Forester's The General <br />Trench Warfare:  Sassoon's Memoirs of an Infantry Officer,  <br />  Cobb's paths of Glory, Frederic Manning's Her Privates We, Ford <br />  Madox Ford's Parade's end, Barbusse's Under Fire, and Pat  <br />  Barker's Regeneration Trilogy. <br />Air War:  Derek Robinson's Goshawk Squadron (and his other 2 <br />  WW I novels). <br />Naval War:  for something different, try John Biggin's A Sailor <br />  of Austria about life in Austrian submarines.	2005-06-07
US	52519625	R3EN3CUVCK1VK	0670034312	757867340	Three Day Road	Books	5	13	17	N	N	fine world war I fiction	Actually, I'd prefer 4 1/2 stars here:  this isn't quite at the <br />level of the great World War I fiction/memoirs.  The novel centers <br /> on two young men--Native Americans from Ontario near <br />Hudson's Bay, and their experiences in trench warfare operating <br />primarily as snipers.  There is also a lot in the book about their  <br />background trapping and hunting, which helps them as  <br />snipers, even though being Native Americans means that they are  <br />also often treated as second-class citizens in the army.  The <br />novel does a good job of capturing the essence and flavor of  <br />trench warfare, but having them operate mainly as snipers gives  <br />them an independence of action that is popular in fiction <br />(it lets the heroes determine the course of action, rather than <br />just being acted upon) but was certainly not usual in WW I. <br />The book also shows the almost inevitable slow disintegration <br />that occurred in the trenches, so that by the end, one of the <br />young men is scalping the enemy, and perhaps even eating some <br />body parts.  Not a pretty picture!  But the trenches were not a <br />place for romantic fiction for the younger set. <br /> <br />The great WW I classics of trench warfare include works by <br />Siegfried Sassoon, Humphrey Cobb, Frederic Manning, Ford Maddox <br />Ford,,and Henri Barbusse [Under Fire is still almost too strong, <br />even after 90 years].  Pat Barker's superb trilogy ranks with <br />those works.  With all of them, one gets almost a surrealistic <br />or science-fiction sense:  life in the trenches seems as alien <br />as living on Neptune.  Three Day Road doesn't quite convey that <br />strange feeling, which might bring it to a full 5 stars, but it <br />is still a fine novel. <br />	2005-06-01
US	52519625	RNAPA6KVDX9OU	1420813684	584723148	The Maelstrom	Books	2	1	1	N	N	a caver's thoughts...	This novel is reminiscent of the recent novel \\"Labyrinth\\" (which  <br />also centers around a Kentucky cave).  Both novels feature huge <br />caves, murdering criminals, and alien rocks or life.  Maelstrom <br />is a 2000-foot deep 10-mile (?) long cave with a vast 600-foot  <br />entrance pit.  The cave harbors a silicon-based bone-dissolving  <br />bacteria-like lifeform which likes crawling up people's legs and <br />arms, and the cave also harbors an insane murderer who seems <br />to be able to ascend and descend the entrance ropes without <br />anyone ever noticing (note:  a 600-foot rappel might take  <br />15 minutes, and an ascent 30-60 minutes, and it's kind of <br />difficult to conceal yourself on the rope!). <br /> <br />The hero, Alan Manning, has had two friends die in the cave, so <br />has not been back in many years.  Those two deaths were the <br />result of what for a caver would be incredibly risky and bone- <br />headed caving practices, and it boggles the mind how Manning <br />himself managed to survive into middle age.  The climactic trip <br />back into the cave with Manning, Susan Brighton (a biologist who <br />is there to check on the alien lifeform) and others is triggered <br />by a caving expedition by 4 college students who rent some ropes, <br />lights, etc, and who lack maps, common sense, and much caving <br />experience. They somehow descend the pit on 4 150-foot long ropes <br />knotted together and reach about 1500 feet deep and 3 miles in, <br />also managing to descend a 150-foot pit without using ropes or <br />vertical equipment.  While exploring a 3-dimensional maze their <br />batteries start fading, and each picked up 2 replacement AA cells <br />at a boondocks convenience store--not having worried about shelf <br />life, so these batteries fade very quickly as well.  The backup <br />light for the group of 4 is one candle and a book of matches. <br />How they intended to cover the 3 miles and 900 vertical feet back <br/>to the entrance pit is unclear, as is how they intended to get <br />back up the 150-foot pit in the dark.  As someone who regularly <br />carries about 120 hours' of light [led lights are a wonderful <br />thing!!] even into a 200-foot long 10-foot deep cave, I would <br />never want to do any caving with ANY of the people in the book,  <br />Manning included. <br /> <br />After numerous murders by the madman there is what I think is <br />meant to be a happy ending--the people on the surface who have <br />been getting their bones dissolved by the alien lifeform can be <br />cured--although it isn't at all clear what this cure is or how <br />it was discovered. <br /> <br />This will join Labyrinth on one of my shelves.  There is too much <br />here that doesn't seem sensible--much like the Friday the 13th <br />characters running off to skinny-dip in the lake at night after <br />numerous freinds have been brutally murdered.  Exploring caves <br />can be very exciting--and exciting and safe at the same time. <br />You do not need murderers and aliens to make a cave book  <br />interesting and dramatic.  For non-fiction, \\"The Longest Cave\\" <br />about the exploration and connections in the Mammoth-Flint Ridge <br />System and \\"Subterranean Climbers\\" about the exploration of the <br />Dent de Crolles in France are classics.  For fiction, \\"Under <br />Plowman's Floor\\" about a caver's 40 years or so in a large cave <br />in Kentucky (based on Mammoth-Flint Ridge) is excellent. <br />Finally, a cave with a 600-foot entrance pit, 2000 feet deep and <br />10 (?) mile-long cave in Kentucky would attract a veritable mob <br />of cavers (rather than the very sporadic visits in the novel). <br />The 500-plus kilometers of the Mammoth Cave System has a vertical <br />extent of only about 400 feet.  So for the Maelstrom, you'd need <br />either a 2000-foot thick bed of limestone or some sharply dipping <br />limestone.  But I guess that having Maelstrom in France or the <br/>Ukraine would not be as popular or American audiences.	2005-05-18
US	52519625	R2EHLA38W1Z62I	1400063051	285413671	Sails on the Horizon: A Novel of the Napoleonic Wars	Books	4	46	49	N	N	well-written, but a few problems	This is a decent book if you enjoy naval fiction of the Napoleonic <br />era.  It is about the sudden rise from second lieutenant to  <br />commander in the career of Charles Edgemont and his subsequent  <br />initial adventures.  Edgemont is called up from the gun deck to take <br />command when the captain and first mate are killed in battle, and he <br />gets credit for the good results that really did not stem from any <br />action on his part.  Admiral Jervis promotes him to the rank of <br />commander and awards him captaincy of a 28-gun frigate.  There are <br />elements here that gave me considerable unease.  In most naval  <br />fiction, the usual idea is that the hero should captain a ship or <br />perhaps command a small fleet:  he should be the actor in charge, <br />and not simply a lower-ranking person who is part of action  <br />outside his control.  Curiously, war novels on land usually take  <br />the opposite approach--the hero is not a general or other high- <br />ranking officer [who are usually far behind the front lines].  So <br />what we have in the novel is a mechanism to elevate Edgemont to <br />independent command as quickly as possible.  My intuition would <br />suggest that under remarkable circumstances a 2nd lieutenant might <br />be promoted to commander, and a ship suitable for a commander <br />might be given to that person--say a 12-gun brig.  Captaincy of a <br />28-gun frigate was post-rank, not commander, I believe.  Even in <br />wartime there would be a long list of post-captains ashore looking <br />for a ship--especially a frigate, and many of most would have some <br />influence at the Admiralty. <br /> <br />Commander Edgemont has a number of small battles with the enemy, <br />and in particular with his nemesis the Santa Brigida, a 40-gun <br />frigate.  Edgemont seems remarkably skillful in his tactics for <br />someone who has never commanded a ship--this also leaves me a bit <br />uneasy.  There is an encounter withLieutenant Horatio Hornblower, <br />which I felt was getting much too cute. <br /> <br />The book is well-written, and the battle scenes are engaging.  It <br />would be nice for Edgemont to have a few character defects-- <br />O'Brien's Aubrey and Lambdin's Lewrie have defects--it helps make <br />them more human, and they also make mistakes. <br /> <br />Lord Cochrane was a real (nonfictional) naval hero of that time-- <br />his skills and exploits  have been used extensively by Forester, <br />O'Brien, Lambdin, and others, and in many ways serves as their <br />model.  Cochrane worked best with small independent commands--away <br />from the restrictions and politics of being one captain in a fleet <br />of, say, 15 men-of-war.  He was the model protagonist.  I wish I <br />could see more naval fiction where the hero was not in charge of <br />the action, not the protagonist.  The early Lambdin novels, with <br />Lewrie as a midshipman and lieutenant are the most enjoyable-- <br />and I'll be forever grateful for Lewrie's slow rise across many <br />novels to post-captain rank.  Edgemont at the start of the novel <br />is 25 years old, having been at sea since he was 13, as I recall. <br />I would very much have liked to see much more of those formative <br />years.  We have seen Alan Lewrie in his first days at sea learning <br />the ropes [literally!], making mistakes, changing from a wastrel <br />to an enjoyable and engaging character--we see how his skills and <br />abilities were formed.  There's not enough of that in most naval <br />fiction--and I would have enjoyed seeing it in this novel.	2005-04-25

Prior to that time <br />I had used Jensen & Barnes' Network Flow Programming (now long out <br />of print).  The code in Jensen & Barnes is in FORTRAN (not so fun <br />or useful for CS majors) and the intended audience seemed to be OR. <br />Ahuja's code is pascal pseudo-code for the most part, which usually <br />translates easily into the C language that most of our students  <br />use. <br /> <br />For CS students, there is excellent use of algorithm analysis <br />(big-O) throughout the book, and there are long discussions <br />about different approaches and algorithms and the complexity of <br />each.  There is a lot of mathematical notation, but my students <br />have never had to worry about PDEs and the like here.  Any good <br />advanced CS student (graduate or undergraduate) will find the <br />book very worthwhile.  In my course the students must implement <br />min-cost spanning trees, shortest paths, critical path/PERT <br />networks (not in Ahuja), max flow, and min-cost flow.  I would <br />also recommend (for CS majors) Tarjan's excellent (and <br />succinct) Data Structures and Network Algorithms.	2004-12-17

The Close Range stories gave a wonderful flavor to the<br /><br />rural areas of the state, the people, the land, the warm and the<br /><br />rough sides, both past and present.  Some of the stories were<br /><br />humorous, others were harrowing, some were a whimsical mix.  You'll<br /><br />find just the same mix (and a bit more) in Bad Dirt.  You start off<br /><br />with a 12-page story about Game & Fish Warden Creel Zmundzinski (who<br /><br />turns up again in a couple of more stories) that begins in a nice<br /><br />straightforward fashion, and then takes off into a kind of<br /><br />humorous Proulx-Stephen King joint venture (or perhaps<br /><br />Proulx-King-Carl Hiaassen).<br /><br />Several stories center on the residents and the 3 bars in the tiny<br /><br />town of Elk City:  I very much like reading another of Proulx'<br /><br />short stories when I feel that I already know the characters well<br /><br />(one of these is a kind of Proulx-Hiaassen mix involving rental<br /><br />alligators--it sounds bizarre, but the story works in a truly<br /><br />delightful way).<br /><br />The best of the stories is The Wamsutter Wolf, and runs about 35<br /><br />pages.  Buddy Millar lives in a $40/month rental housetrailer<br /><br />5 miles out from the center of a small boomtown (almost all<br /><br />trailers).  You don't get much for your $40 a month.  His only<br /><br />neighbors live close by in an even grungier trailer--a bully who<br /><br />beat him up in high school, his wife and passel of grungy young<br /><br />kids, one of whom is a 4-year-old alcoholic (his father believes<br /><br />that learning to drink young avoids the problems that come with<br /><br />learning later).  This is a horrifying and harrowing story--<br /><br />stronger than anything I remember in Close Range.  It's very<br /><br />tough, utterly realistic, and it left me wanting to see it<br /><br />expanded to about 300 pages as a novel.<br /><br />Annie Proulx and William Gay (I Hate To See The Evening Sun Go<br /><br />Down) are the two best short-story writers I've read in many<br /><br />years--and both write excellent novels as well.<br />Annie Proulx and William Gay (I Hate To See The Evening Sun Go <br />Down) are the two best short-story writers I've read in many <br />years--and both write excellent novels as well.	2004-11-26

Slogum House should not be missed--it's certainly on a par with<BR>Lonesome Dove.  It's realistic and uncompromising--but don't look<BR>for the sweep of Lonesome Dove, or the shootouts of most westerns.<BR>The novel is about the Slogum family of Nebraska in the late 1800's <BR>and up to the 1930's.  Gulla Slogum rules the ranch--she's greedy<BR>and unscrupulous--willing to prositute her daughters and encourage<BR>her sons to rob and kill in order to expand her small empire.  She<BR>keeps a map, and slowly over the years is able to add new pieces<BR>to the Slogum holdings.  The sheriff and judge are kept on the<BR>string with payoffs--both money and the sexual favors of two of<BR>the daughters. There are no traditional shootouts--the sons<BR>find things are much safer if they shoot someone in the back with<BR>a rifle from a distance--why take chances?  <br />The husband, Ruedy, is well-meaning, but weak.  The two youngest<BR>children, Libby and Ward, are decent people.  There are others<BR>over the years who come and go--such as Butch, Gulla's sadistic<BR>brother.  This is a portrayal of frontier life at it's best and<BR>it's worst--at a time when the indian fighting is past, and when<BR>we think that things are civilized.

There are also innumerable potboilers, and I'm not <BR>including here the naval side of the military.  Crofton's Fire is a<BR>decent, well-written novel that incorporates military action from<BR>the Little Bighorn to the Zulu War--quite a lot of military action<BR>but not a lot of the detail that helps distinguish the previously-<BR>mentioned novels. For me, an important question is always &quot;Do I <BR>want to reread this book?  If yes, 1 year later?  2 years?  Or <BR>do I take this book down to the local used-book dealer and sell<BR>it?&quot;  I also ask myself when I finish the book &quot;How much of what<BR>I've just read do I remember?&quot;  When I first read Fraser's<BR>Flashman, many years ago, I knew I wanted to reread it within a<BR>year, and I was annoyed that there was only this first book<br />available at that time.  With Cornwell's Sharpe books, I'm <BR>hanging on to the ones I have, and will eventually reread them--<BR>but I have not bought the most recent ones in the series.  I'll<BR>keep Crofton's Fire, and I'd like to see the next in what might<BR>be a series.<br />With the Flashman and Sharpe books, there is a lot of detail<BR>about the military actions--both authors expected to be writing<BR>a lot of novels in the series, so they did not feel a need to<BR>cover a large number of different battles in a single book. <BR>These books consequently give a good flavor for military life,<BR>weapons, strategy/tactics, etc.  We'll have to see where the<BR>Crofton series goes in this regard--I would have preferred more<BR>detail.<br />Crofton starts as a Lieutenant (graduated from West Point)--<BR>well-taught, well-trained, brave, a good fellow.  No adultery,<BR>an occasional drinking bout, no cheating at cards, etc. By<BR>contrast, Flashman'sfather buys him a commission to get him out<BR>of the house, and Flashman happily drinks, practices lechery<BR>wholeheartedly, cheats, toadies, avoids battles (unsuccessfully,<BR>usually winding up in the thick of the fighting)--not what you'd<BR>call a good fellow.

A Short History of a Small Place is his best<BR>work, and ranks among the greatest American fiction of the 20th<BR>century.  There are other great Southern writers such as Faulkner <BR>and Eudora Welty, but Pearson is the only one I know of who is able<BR>to capture the folksy gossip that takes place at the small-town<BR>general store.  His writing is whimsical and lyrical, and the turns<BR>of phrase will keep you smiling:  &quot;Kenny, his name was, and he sort<BR>of worked at a local muffler shop, a shabby unfranchised enterprise<BR>on the rise behind the Sinclair where they never stocked your<BR>muffler exactly but carried one they could make fit.  They knew<BR>inordinate need for mallets and main force, bent tailpipes with<BR>their knees...&quot;  Which sounds like many places I know, but I<BR>couldn't phrase it that well.<br />The novel is a narrative from Paul Tatum, who works as an<BR>accountant, helping people with taxes and the like.  He offers<BR>reflections about various townspeople he knows, their oddities<BR>and eccentricities.  These are small-town peculiarities, the kinds<BR>of things that you'd actually see in a small town--no axe murders<BR>and such that too many novelists seem to feel are essential to<BR>make a story interesting.<br />Pearson is always at his best in the southern small town.  In this<BR>novel Tatum visits Venice:  in Pearson's novel Blue Ridge, some<BR>of the story took place in New York.  Such visits to urban sites<BR>don't seem to work as well for Pearson--a bit like Michael Jordan<BR>trying his hand at baseball, although Pearson in an urban setting<BR>is vastly superior to Jordan on a baseball field.  The ending is<BR>rather downbeat:  Pearson has worked murders into several novels:<BR>Cry Me a River, Blue Ridge, and Off for the Sweet Hereafter, but<BR>it doesn't work quite as well here.  Still--Pearson is always<BR>worth reading, and it's a fine novel.	2003-09-27

As with Rats, or Len Deighton's<BR>Bomber, there is a good amount of technical detail--particularly<BR>regarding the T-34 and Tiger tanks--design strengths and flaws,<BR>what it's like to be in one, and this adds a lot to the novel.<BR>Too many war novels like to employ the device of having an evil<BR>antagonist--someone who relishes torturing prisoners, etc, and<BR>who gets his comeuppance in the end.

This is easily the best novel I've read about bicycle racing--<BR>it's relatively short, no murders, no love interest, just<BR>bicycle racing pure and simple.  It centers on a single minor<BR>1-day race in southern France, 150 kilometers in the mountains,<BR>and a racer (Krabbe) who is decent but not professional caliber.<BR>The novel is part stream-of-thought, part flashbacks to Krabbe's<BR>other 300+ races, part anecdotes about the great cyclists from<BR>the Tour de France and elsewhere.  If you want a baseball<BR>analogy, Krabbe would be playing in the low minor leagues, and<BR>describing the life there, and relating some tales about well-<BR>known major-leaguers--kind of a Ron Shelton [Bull Durham] of<BR>bicycle racing.  In the Tour de France, the police keep the roads<BR>clear for the racers:  in the Tour de Mont Aigoual, police are<BR>at intersections directing the racers, but you share the road<BR>with ordinary drivers.

A leader of the cotton farmers in the<BR>poorest area of Clarke County is killed, and the cotton farmers<BR>form a night rider group for retaliation against those they feel<BR>are their enemies--primarily townspeople.  But the night riders<BR>(who also operate in daylight here) also use their power to kill<BR>and terrorize any who do not support them and contribute to them.<BR>So what could have been seen as having some semblance of virtue<BR>(not much, but some) becomes more like the Black Hand or the<BR>Klan.<br />The novel centers mostly on the aging sheriff, Billy Waite, and<BR>to a slightly lesser extent on 16-year-old Macky Burke, who<BR>becomes one of the night riders, and also 3-4 other characters.<BR>Violence and killing are not uncommon here:  law and order seems<BR>to be a philosophy, but not a practice.  This is not a book for<BR>the squeamish, and if you like a novel with heroes doing noble<BR>and heroic deeds, look elsewhere.  Everyone has unpleasant flaws,<BR>to a greater or lesser extent, but that's really from a point of<BR>view over 100 years after the events.  If the sheriff watches<BR>someone get lynched, for example, it probably was neither <BR>shocking nor unusual back then.<br />The novel gives an excellent sense of time and place, but the<BR>writing is not as lyrical as, say, William Gay or Cormac <BR>McCarthy.  This is compensated for by the historical flavor,<BR>and it opens up to view a locale and a conflict that one might<BR>compare to the Johnson County War in Wyoming, or the battles<BR>in Harlan County in Kentucky.

Thomas Cromwell (the Vicar General of<BR>England) sends Matthew Shardlake to Scarnsea to investigate the<BR>murder of Cromwell's previous emissary  Shardlake, who is a <BR>hunchback, also must look into other murders as well at the<BR>monastery.<br />The primary interest here is in the historical period, and the<BR>view of political and religious matters.  Anne Boleyn's beheading<BR>occurred in 1536 on trumped-up charges of adultery, and Thomas<BR>More was beheaded in 1535 for refusing to acknowledge the<BR>religious primacy of Henry.  Many Catholic clergy went to the<BR>scaffold; others were racked until they renounced their faith in<BR>favor of Henry.  The novel presents a good glimpse of life in<BR>this time of transition.<br />As a mystery, this is not Agatha Christie; as a look at religious<BR>matters, this is not The Name of the Rose.  The characters do not<BR>have a richness of depth, and the overall writing is good, but <BR>not lyrical.  Read it as a good historical novel, not as a great<BR>novel.	2003-05-07

This novel centers on the<BR>first couple of years of the british bomber command.  Some of<BR>the characters from his other novels (e.g. the intelligence<BR>officer \\"Skull\\" Skeleton) appear here--a nice way of helping<BR>give continuity--Fighter Command (Piece of Cake), Bomber<BR>Command (this novel), North Africa (A Good Clean Show), etc.<BR>The novels pull no punches--terrible tactical theory, hugely<BR>inflated combat claims, etc--you learn a lot about little-known<BR>historical details, things that the military establishment <BR>would rather be forgotten.  These are not anti-war novels, but<BR>novels which often stess the dichotomy between the individual<BR>pilots and aircrew and the military bureaucrats who lay down<BR>policy.  The example that best springs to mind (Goshawk<BR>Squadron, air combat in WW I) is when Squadron Commander<BR>Woolley is told that headquarters deosn't want any more silk<BR>scarves issued (too expensive).  These scarves are needed<BR>because the pilots must continually turn their heads to look<BR>for enemy aircraft--no silk scarves means bad chafing and less<BR>head-turning and more danger.  Woolley puts a couple of bullets<BR>through the briefcase with the HQ demand.<br />Robinson's best novels are his WW I novels--5 stars, with <BR>Goshawk Squadron being the best.  The WW II novels are close--<BR>4 to 5 stars.  My star ratings are usually based on how often<BR>I would reread a novel--I reread Goshawk Squadron about once a<BR>year--similarly Piece of Cake.  4-star novels are not quite as<BR>rereadable.  There are a couple of 1-star books that I will<BR>reread once in a while, for amusement--these books really<BR>deserve much less than 1 star.  Some books I keep, some get sold<BR>to used bookdealers.  Derek Robinson's novels I keep--and often<BR>get a backup copy for my office.	2003-03-09

Having just finished Shuffle (after reading Triggerfish Twist),<BR>and now rereading Florida Roadkill, I can say that Dorsey is<BR>better than Hiaasen's weaker novels, but still is a ways from<BR>Hiaasen's best work (Tourist Season, Skin Tight). With Hiaasen's<BR>best work, the characters and events from each novel stick in<BR>mind for years.  With Hiaasen's second-tier work, the characters<BR>and events tend to blur together, so at this point I remember<BR>very little about what went on in, say, Sick Puppy.  Tim Dorsey's<BR>work comes closer to this latter situation:  I can remember some<BR>good bits and pieces, but there's a lot of blurring, even with<BR>Stingray Shuffle, which I just finished last night.  That doesn't<BR>bode well.<br />Like Hiaasen's work, Tim Dorsey's novels are entertaining. filled<BR>with a dark humor and scathing views of some of the less pleasant<BR>aspects of Florida.  Dorsey is primarily the Tampa area, in<BR>contrast to Hiaasen's Miami.  Both writers have very sharp<BR>and witty episodes with politicians, tourists, businesses that<BR>cater to tourists, the drug-trade side of the state, etc.<BR>Hiaasen's hero-types tend to be reluctant about killing:  <BR>Dorsey's Serge Storms (featured in all the novels so far) is an<BR>enthusiast, usually killing in bizarre ways--entertaining in<BR>small quantities, but not quite as appetizing when done several<BR>times in each book.  Dorsey is also fond (to the point of<BR>getting a bit tiresome at times) of having Serge Storms digress<BR>at length on  historical and cultural details and minutae.<BR>In Stingray Shuffle, he also has some other detail freaks<BR>expounding in the same fashion as Storms--which doesn't help the<BR>novel.<br />Still and all, it's an entertaining novel, worth reading.	2003-02-07

There are books<BR>on nature which are dry and distanced:  this is just the<BR>opposite.

Neither Thoreau nor Annie Dillard<BR>measured the rectal temperature of insects in the winter to<BR>help determine the mechanics of heat regulation.  Most of the<BR>mammals, birds, insects, and trees looked at by the author are<BR>his neighbors in the winter woods:  the love and enjoyment and<BR>the curiosity about his environment is very evident.  He wants<BR>to know what these creatures do to cope and survive the severe<BR>winters where he lives in Maine and Vermont.<BR>   <BR>Heinrich writes with great warmth and humor throughout the book.<BR>You'll follow his thoughts and discoveries about how the tiny<BR>golden-crowned kinglet survives the winter, when logic seems to<BR>say that it shouldn't even survive a single below-zero night.<BR>On sunny days, even when the temperature is well below freezing,<BR>several dozen honeybees may emerge from the hive and just a few<BR>seconds later will all be lying dead on the snow:  this is a <BR>sacrificial testing mechanism by the hive to ensure that when<BR>the first flowers open up that a head start can be obtained for<BR>foraging.  There are all kinds of fascinating things that you<BR>could never imagine going on.

So the <BR>words are all English, but the words often make no sense in the<BR>context.  Labyrinth has some of that flavor--you say \\"Huh?  Did I<BR>miss something?\\"<br />A rock with mysterious powers is brought back from the moon in<BR>1972.  In 2004, the villian, Dr Gregor, murders his professor and<BR>steals the rock.  In 2007 Gregor and some fellow prisoners escape<BR>from state prison in Kentucky.  \\"Huh?\\" Apparently Gregor only<BR>partially strangled his professor in Tennessee, popped the prof<BR>into the trunk of his car, drove to Kentucky, and finished <BR>killing him there, hid the rock in a cave in Kentucky, and was<BR>caught 2 weeks later, the body still in the trunk.  How do you <BR>tell at that point where the murder actually occurred?<br />Tom Burke, the world's greatest caver--\\"Huh?  There are <BR>rankings?  Maybe in 2004 the NSS News will publish annual <BR>rankings?\\"--and his daughter Cricket are about to start a <BR>through-trip of the world's longest cave--Labyrinth--which he<BR>discovered and mapped 380 miles in 5 years (another very large<BR>\\"Huh?\\" here--a 3-man team that surveys half a mile of cave has<BR>had a very good day surveying).  The 125-mile long through trip<BR>is so NASA can test the feasibility of mining on the moon--Huh?<BR>crawling through a cave at Earth gravity is the same as walking<BR>in a mine on the moon?  No attention is paid to the weather<BR>forecast--Huh?  Cavers going into extensive stream passage pay<BR>attention to weather forecasts or are short-lived--I have seen<BR>water shooting out of a 6x6 foot cave entrance (normally dry) as<BR>if from a fire hydrant.<br />Gregor and his gang, rather than go into an entrance close to the<BR>moon rock, go to an entrance some 40 miles away--carrying no<BR>caving gear at all (Huh?) and by coincidence, arrive at the<BR>entrance just as Tom Burke and his crew arrive--so the bad guys<BR>grab cave gear and take Tom and Cricket to help guide them<BR>through the cave to the rock--a trip which will take several <BR>days.  We then have scenes of going through the cave.  Meanwhile,<BR>Tom's wife Whitney is recruited by the police to guide the in<BR>the cave--she and Tom are the only ones able to find their way<BR>around (Huh?  Did Tom and Whitney do all the mapping and set up<BR>the resupply dumps all by themselves?).<br />Problems occur when a huge earthquake collapses various passages<BR>and cave entrances.  A gargantuan storm has occurred, causing<BR>flooding, and the lightning has caused the moon rock to trigger<BR>the earthquake (Huh?  This is the first thunderstorm in central<BR>Kentucky in 3 1/2 years?  Why no earlier earthquakes?).  A dam<BR>breaks near the cave causing further flooding and more problems<BR>for those in and out of the cave.  Eventually Gregor and the<BR>Burkes (Tom, Whitney,and Cricket) all get to the moon rock.<BR>Soon, the book ends.<br />I still don't see how carefully-planning prison-breakers would<BR>go to a remote cave entrance without cave gear--but I guess that<BR>such things are forgotten amongst the action that follows.<br />There is little in the way of good (4 or 5 stars) cave fiction--<BR>Under Plowman's Floor by Richard Watson is a 5-star novel about<BR>exploring caves in Kentucky--based on Watson's own experiences<BR>in the Mammoth Cave complex--no murders, no moon rocks.  Shibumi<BR>by Trevanian--not a cave novel--has some fine caving scenes.<BR>Nevada Barr has a 2 to 3 star mystery centered on a cave in the<BR>Carlsbad area.  On the bottom lies Dallas Down, which has the<BR>hero exploring caves in his cavemobile, and who thwarts the<BR>people who are trying to collapse Dallas into the giant cavern<BR>under the city.  There is plenty of excellent non-fiction:<BR>Watson & Brucker's The Longest Cave, about the exploration and<BR>connecting of the pieces of the Mammoth Cave system; Subterranean<BR>Climbers by Chevalier is also a classic.  Exploring caves can be<BR>enormously exciting--when you squeeze through a tight crawl into<BR>a huge chamber no human has been in previously, for example. You<BR>don't need fiction to make it exciting. Labyrinth would not have<BR>suffered if the cave was not the world's longest cave and if <BR>Burke was not the world's greatest caver--these are overworked<BR>devices, much like thrillers where the president's daughter is<BR>kidnapped--good fiction doesn't need such devices--the daughter<BR>of the vice-mayor of Wartburg does just fine if someone must be<BR>kidnapped in the plot.  Sullivan has a lot of the pieces--he <BR>calls cavers cavers and not spelunkers, for example, but there<BR>are too many times when you pause and say \\"Huh?\\"	2002-12-06

This is storytelling at its very best.<BR>If you have ever been in a small town and listened to the locals<BR>gossip at a sewing circle or on the porch of the general store,<BR>you'll understand the writing style.  It's rambling narrative,<BR>told by the young boy Louis Benfield.  One thread leads to <BR>another thread, which leads to a third thread:  eventually you<BR>return to the first thread and make some progress before going<BR>off again to another thread.  At the general store in your small<BR>town Fred will be talking about his sister Betsy:  well, Betsy's<BR>husband Will is one of the Smythville Jeeters, the ones whose<BR>father JimBob stole Joe Parker's prize hog.  So the locals will<BR>talk a bit about Joe Parker, and eventually we'll get back to<BR>Betsy.<br />This is most definitely NOT a book that you can read if you have<BR>a lot of distractions, are generally fidgety, etc.  You need time<BR>and patience--it's like the finest coffee or wine--you sip it<BR>rather than gulp it down.  I gave a copy to a colleague:  she<BR>started it 5 times and could never get through more than a few<BR>pages.  Then she had some time free of distractions, read the<BR>whole book, and loved it.  You have to listen to the sentences<BR>in your mind, just as you would listen to the locals at the<BR>general store.<br />Every small town has its characters:  those who are eccentric,<BR>those who are \\"peculiar\\" (there's a difference).  There is Miss<BR>Pettigrew, whose pet monkey Mr Britches climbs the flagpole in<BR>his coat and porkpie hat.  There are the three Epperson sisters<BR>who live together and dress identically, and who one day decide<BR>that they are triplets, and start circulating petitions to have<BR>people acknowledge their triplethood.  There are plenty of<BR>people who are not eccentric or peculiar, but who manage to<BR>do things which attract comment.  A young friend of Louis <BR>Benfield has a pet guinea pig named Artemus Gordon.  When <BR>Artemus Gordon gets sick, the boy's friends speculate on the <BR>cause:  one friend insists the guinea pig has gonorrhea, a <BR>disease he heard (vaguely) about from his older sister.  When<BR>Artemus Gordon dies, the boy wants to ensure that he goes to <BR>Heaven, so at an open-casket funeral (very common in the South)<BR>he quietly places the dead guinea pig in the coffin when nobody<BR>is looking.  The furry dead beast, nestled beside the dear<BR>departed, is soon discovered, causing quite a flurry.  The book<BR>is full of such stories.  You find yourself developing a real<BR>affection for Neely, North Carolina, and its people, and you<BR>feel that you know the town and people well.<br />A real treasure!	2002-07-22

A wonderfully entertaining book--part archaelogy, part detective<BR>novel-like, part art.  Lavishly illustrated (black-and-white with<BR>blue to highlight):  maps (showing locations where fragments<BR>and tablets, etc, were found, historical influences, such as<BR>Kush on Upper Egypt); hieroglyphs, symbols, etc; photographs;<BR>drawings, etc.  You can spend a lot of time just on these<BR>illustrations alone.<br />The book starts off with chapters on three deciphered (more or <BR>less) languages:  Egyptian hieroglyphs, Linear B, and Mayan<BR>glyphs, and describes how these languages were finally solved.<BR>Problems arise because some languages are based on logograms,<BR>where a symbol represents a word (e.g. \\"man\\"), some have symbols<BR>representing a syllable, and some have symbols representing<BR>just a letter--a part of a syllable--as in English. To make<BR>matters worse, some languages have mixtures of these types.<BR>It can be helpful for decipherers to have an idea of the<BR>spoken language--Linear B turned out to be a form of Greek,<BR>but the written symbols were not the familiar Greek letters.<BR>Bilingual stelae--such as the Rosetta Stone--are very helpful--<BR>if they can be found.<br />After showing how the three aforementioned languages were<BR>solved, the author then spends the second half of the book on<BR>8 languages which have not been deciphered, beyond, perhaps,<BR>a few words.  Some of these languages are \\"isolates\\" which<BR>have no other modern or ancient language which is similar--<BR>nobody speaks Etruscan, which died out in the first century B.C.<BR>(Basque is a modern-day isolate, bearing no relation to other<BR>languages).  One of the most interesting of these undeciphered<BR>languages is rongorongo, found on Easter Island, which is 2000<BR>miles from the nearest other human habitation (Pitcairn Island,<BR>of Bounty fame, is 1400 miles away).  It is suspected that the<BR>inhabitants of Easter Island came from Polynesia, and that<BR>rongorongo is a written form of Polynesian.  So with rongorongo<BR>and the other languages, the author leads you through clues,<BR>hypotheses, hopeful leads, false trails to show why each<BR>language is still undeciphered, even though bits and pieces<BR>may have been solved.<br />So we have, in essence, a detective novel that isn't fiction.<BR>No crime, no murder, but clues and curiosities and detectives.<BR>It's like reading about Turing, Bletchley Park, and the Enigma<BR>machine--but as the author notes, the German codes were<BR>\\"malicious\\"--designed to hinder decipherment--and these lost<BR>languages are not malicious, but pose very different kinds<BR>of problems for the would-be decipherer.	2002-07-20

It does an excellent job capturing the flavor of<BR>the time and place--Cape Cod in 1968.  The book works very well<BR>on a variety of levels: the relationship between an older woman<BR>and a younger man, politics and power structures, and life at a<BR>small-town newspaper.  Claire Malek leaves Washington and, by<BR>chance, winds up as a reporter for the Covenant, a twice-a-week<BR>paper in a town on the Cape.  She has a lot of learning, and a <BR>lot of unlearning to do about the job.  A twice-weekly small-town<BR>paper is not like the N.Y. Times or the USA Today, and the job<BR>of a reporter is very different.  You'll learn a great deal from<BR>this novel about the operation of such a paper, from the flatbed<BR>press to the manual typewriters, but there's no getting bogged<BR>down in the details.  The author's father and grandfather were<BR>editors of the Falmouth Enterprise (on Cape Cod) and his great-<BR>uncle was Henry Beetle Hough, Pulitzer-winning long-time editor<BR>of the Vineyard Gazette, so the author can describe life on<BR>such a newspaper with loving care.<br />The Covenant's editor has a son Lane who has just graduated from<BR>college, and who also works on the paper, and there is an<BR>attraction between Lane and Claire, which develops into a <BR>relationship.  I have read all too many books which would take<BR>this basic theme and exploit it in an unpleasant manner, but<BR>here things seem very natural and not labored.<br />The writing style is a joy.  As the book gently points out, <BR>as Claire learns, good reporters can tell a story succinctly<BR>and cleanly--they don't waste space, but neither do they<BR>abbreviate.  The writing style has this flavor--there is no<BR>sense of padding, no extraneous verbiage, things are told<BR>straightfowardly.  Too many novels--too many popular novels--<BR>are short stories padded into 300-page books.  John Grisham's<BR>novels seem tobe this way, whereas Scott Turow's books are not.<BR>The Last Summer has a fine, easy, unlabored flow to it, and you<BR>don't find paragraphs and pages that you wish had been left out.<br />There's an epilogue, which brings Claire and Lane back together<BR>after almost 30 years, and the epilogue provides an excellent<BR>counterpoint to the overrated Bridges of Madison County.  In<BR>Bridges, each of the lovers has no clue about what the other is<BR>doing over the following years--this never seemed believable--<BR>a top photographer/author who continues his work can be found,<BR>and the photographer can get the local paper, which would let<BR>him know some of what is going on with her life.  This is not<BR>always true--it can be hard to find a transient, for example.<BR>In Last Summer, Lane and Claire both stay in the newspaper<BR>business, and, realistically and believably, each has been<BR>able to follow the career and life of the other.<br />A fine read.	2002-07-10

I'd rate the first half or so 4 stars, the second half 2 stars.<BR>The first half does a good job of portraying the very thin<BR>veneer between the upper classes and the lower classes--the<BR>upper crust being, by and large, as corrupt as those who are<BR>in the condemned cells in Newgate Prison--but the upper class<BR>people very rarely are punished for the crimes that the lower<BR>classes are hanged or transported for.  The hero, Rider Sandman,<BR>mixes between the two classes well.<br />The second half of the book starts to wander:  there is less<BR>of historical/sociological interest as Sandman gathers his team<BR>to uncover the real murderer.  The climax--let me put that in<BR>quotes \\"climax\\" --is a last-minute, last-second race to get a<BR>reprieve for the wrongly accused man and rescue him from the<BR>gallows.  This last-minute race to save an innocent person from<BR>execution has been overworked to death in novels--it always seems<BR>that the reprieve is at the last second, rather than a day or a<BR>week before the execution--this has come to resemble the almost<BR>inevitable car chase in action movies--original variations of<BR>car chases are few and far between.  So the interest generated by<BR>the first half of the book is not sustained in the second half.	2002-06-11

This book brought to mind a Superman comic I read about 40 years<br />ago.  In the comic, the bad guy, for reasons obscure now, ran off<br />and hid with a penguin. Superman wants to catch the bad guy.  So<br />there follows a mind-boggling 3 panels in the comic:<br />1) In order to make the penguin's egg hatch quickly, Superman<br />  heats the egg with his x-ray vision, causing the egg to hatch<br />  in seconds rather than weeks.<br />2) The baby penguin is born fully-fledged and ready to fly, which<br />  is good because:<br />3) As Superman explains, babies (birds, or all creatures?) have<br />  an instinctual knowledge of where their mother is at all<br />  times, and so the baby penguin flies through the air (I kid<br />  you not) on a bee-line for its mother, followed closely behind<br />  by Superman.<br />End Times provides a similar plethora.  You will learn such<br />things as:<br />1) Russia's number-one enemy is Israel.  This is because there<br />  are tens of millions of Arabs in Russia (presumably in<br />  Uzbekistan, etc), all of whom hate Israel more than anything--<br />  why, because they're Arabs, of course.  This will result in<br />  Russia attacking Israel.  (was Malcolm X an Arab?)<br />2) Biblical prophesies indicate that when the Russians attack<br />  Israel, the weapons (here the authors very generously accept<br />  that the weapons being  bows and arrows and spears should be<br />  taken figuratively rather than literally) burn for 5 years.<br />  Burning for 5 years, unlike bows and spears, must be taken<br />  literally, and so to achieve this, Russian tanks, planes,<br />  artillery, etc, must be made almost entirely of wood.<br />3) For the first time ever, we are seeing earthquakes occurring<br />  on the same day.<br />And so on.  The level of writing is slightly higher than one sees<br />in the Left Behind series (I counted only 2 5-syllable words in<br />Left Behind: in-ves-ti-ga-tion, fun-da-men-tal-ism, and words of<br />4 syllables seemed to be carefully rationed to about one every<br />10 pages or so).  If you can pick and choose the passages in the<br />Bible that should be taken literally, and those which should be<br />taken figuratively, you can establish almost any kind of truth<br />you want.  There's a fine book \\"Who Wrote the Bible?\\" that I'd<br />recommend--a scholarly work, which makes for good reading.to about one every<BR>10 pages or so).

A number of well-known historical incidents<BR>(the Merkle Boner, the striking of of Bench who thought he was<BR>getting an intentional walk, etc) occur to characters in the<BR>book--perhaps interesting to readers unfamiliar with the game,<BR>but somewhat offensive to those who know the true contexts.<BR>I would much preferred not to see a pennant drive as the climax--<BR>too many sports novels/movies seem to think that a Super Bowl<BR>or a world Series being on the line makes things more <BR>interesting--the movie Bull Durham didn't need this device, and<BR>Semi-Tough had the Super Bowl as a rather minor incident. Perhaps<BR>significantly, there are only 17 players listed on the team,<BR>including what appears to be a 3-man starting rotation and two<BR>relievers, and only a few of these players are endowed with<BR>character. <BR>      The two best baseball novels are Robert Coover's<BR>Universal Baseball Association, and Roth's The Great American<BR>Novel.  In the former, J. Henry Waugh creates a fantasy league<BR>controlled by dice--and rules and is ruled by the game--the<BR>players are all given very distinct characters by Waugh.  In the<BR>latter, in 1943 the Ruppert Mundys of the Patriot League are<BR>displaced from their stadium (the war effort, you know) and<BR>play 154 road games.  This is a hilarious book, and you get to<BR>know all the misfits (such as Hothead Ptah, the wooden-legged<BR>catcher).  People who enjoy baseball will appreciate both these<BR>novels, and the characters have a real depth to them--you do not<BR>need pennant chases to make things interesting.  McAllister's<BR>golf novels can be reread with pleasure every couple of years,<BR>and Coover's and Roth's books can also be reread once a year--<BR>but I do not expect to be rereading the review book.	2002-05-16

Pearson	This follows the place and characters from Pearson's Blue Ridge.<BR>Wonderfully whimsical, full of fascinating small-town events and<BR>people. There's a mystery here, but that's just one thread--if<BR>you're looking for John Grisham or Mickey Spillane or Agatha<BR>Christie, this isn't for you.  No kidnapping of the president's<BR>daughter by terrorists or other national perils, but rather a<BR>missing child and small-town crimes such as pilfered fruit. This<BR>is a book that cannot be hurried through--if you've ever sat down<BR>with the locals at the small-town general store or sewing circle<BR>and listened to the tales and gossip for several hours, you'll<BR>have an appreciation for the writing style.  Unlike life in a <BR>city, you're known by your family and relatives by marriage and<BR>the like--one of the Smythville Jeeters whose daughter married<BR>the oldest Bynum boy from Wartburg, the one who drives the UPS <BR>truck.  So a thread will start up, and that will occasion some<BR>comments about so-and-so's family, and that leads into another<BR>thread of talk, and a further thread--eventually getting back to<BR>the first thread where some progress is made before wandering off<BR>again to other threads.  When you listen to the locals at the<BR>general store/sewing circle, they want to know where a person is<BR>from, who their cousins are, where they work, etc.  This could be<BR>insufferably boring, but the threads that Pearson follows in his<BR>books take you to a tapestry of foibles and eccentricities that<BR>are fascinating.  This is certainly the funniest new book I've<BR>read in a couple of years, and one I'm already looking forward to<BR>rereading, even though I just finished it two hours ago.	2002-01-14
US	52519625	RSCNIWPRQXPRC	0375412395	175070899	An Affair of Honor	Books	5	8	8	N	N	fine storytelling	A wonderful book, on a par with the work of Ferrol Sams and T.R.<BR>Pearson, set in Bourbonville, Tennessee (a fictionalized<BR>Lenoir City) 25 miles SW of Knoxville.  An excellent sense of<BR>place and time, the third book in a trilogy starting with The<BR>Coming of Rain (Bourbonville in 1885) and followed by After the<BR>War (Bourbonville 1917-1927 or so).  Affair of Honor takes place<BR>in the mid-1950s and after (saying when might give away some of<BR>the plot)--characters, children and grandchildren of characters<BR>from the other two novels appear here.  In many ways this is the<BR>richest and most tapestried of the three books.  As with the<BR>books of Ferrol Sams and T.R. Pearson, this is one you look<BR>forward to rereading a year from now.	2001-12-28
