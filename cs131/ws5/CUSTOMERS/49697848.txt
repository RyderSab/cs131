The protagonist, a film producer who initially thinks life can continue as normal, takes us step by step through the transition from sadness to resentment to anger to resistance against a brutal occupying force.<br /><br />Furst's real achievement in this novel is taking the mundane and the normal and weaving them into the difficult and violent world of war and occupation.  Everyday experiences like eating, drinking, earning a living, loving and talking are the primary daily behaviors around which the characters interact, but they are all intruded upon by the occupation.  This is what makes the book so \\"real.\\"<br /><br />Furst combines history, fiction, and the mysteries of espionage as well as anyone since Eric Ambler. He is always worth reading.	2004-12-02

Every once in a while he breaks away from his various detective formulas (there are now three patterns evolving with three different main characters) and writes something that tears at your heart, gets inside your head, and leaves with you with thoughts you had never had before.<br /><br />Double Play returns us to the segregated world of 1947 and Jackie Robinson's arrival as the first African American baseball player to join the then all white major leagues.  Parker captures the turmoil, tension, racism, and complexities of the time. There are twists I had never considered such as the threat to Black baseball of having all the good players join the major leagues (it destroyed what had been up until then a vibrant league).<br /><br />Parker has this wonderful ability to capture an insight in one sentence. Describing the son of a leading gangster, Parker writes he \\"is what happens when money and power combine with weakness and cruelty.\\"<br /><br />On a happier note he reminds us of Branch Rickey's rule that \\"luck is the residue of intention.\\"  Rickey, as the General Manager of the Dodgers who integrated baseball, comes through as a strong and committed person who thought he was both doing the right thing and the smart thing.<br /><br />Parker's portrait of Robinson as a man who understands how great the burden is that he is carrying and that the hopes of a generation of younger African Americans is riding on his shoulders is worth the entire book.<br /><br />This is a complex and wonderfully written book that captures far more than I have outlined.  I recommend it to anyone interested in being educated and entertained about an important moral moment while reading a fun novel to boot.	2004-11-18

The humanity of the characters (including a retired policeman from earlier novels who was a young man when Hillerman started writing, a young police man and woman who are falling for each other, and the people involved in the murder and the tragedy of their lives) is well expressed.  The result is a world and cast that you genuinely come to care about.<br /><br />The simplicity and the tragedy of the story as it finally unfolds will remind you that doing evil often has side effects and consequences unimaginable when the act is first contemplated.<br /><br />This is a fine novel.	2004-11-18

Even the U.N. demographers now agree that the population explosion will never reach the numbers they had once projected.<br /><br />The biggest reason for this dramatic decline was captured in an earlier book by Mr. Wattenberg, \\"The Birth Dearth.\\" Women are simply having fewer children and the result is that in some countries population is already starting to go down.<br /><br />As Mr. Wattenberg notes, in order to sustain the current population, the average woman would have to have 2.33 children. Falling below that average will result in a population decline. Today some 40 countries are already below the replacement rate and Mr. Wattenberg expects virtually every country to be below the replacement rate by the end of our lifetime.<br /><br />Fascinatingly, after all the focus on Chinese compulsory population control, it is not China that has had the most rapid change in birthrates among Asian countries. That honor goes to South Korea, where women now average only 1.17 children (even lower than Japan). China has dropped to 1.825 and is still declining.<br /><br />Mr. Wattenberg makes so many fascinating points in this thin book that it is impossible to cover them all in a review. However, a few deserve to be singled out.<br /><br />Europe is going to lose population dramatically by mid-century and therefore become significantly older. This will almost certainly entail a significant shift in power and in economic competitiveness away from an aging and shrinking European Union.<br /><br />Mexico is on the verge of dropping below the replacement rate; over the next generation this will almost certainly slow the rate of migration to the United States. Russia is facing a demographic crisis, with the shortest lifespan for males of any industrial country and a catastrophic decline in women willing to bear children.<br /><br />Mr. Wattenberg highlights the intellectual dishonesty of the Paul Ehrlich, left-wing environmentalists and their factual mistakes over the last generation. Mr. Ehrlich had predicted famines beginning in the 1970s. They simply haven't happened. The global warming projections all assumed a population of 11.5 billion. If the human race peaks at only 8.5 billion people - 3 billion fewer than predicted - and then starts a long-term decline, how that changes all those gloom-and-doom predictions.<br /><br />Mr. Wattenberg highlights the unique role of the United States as the one industrial country that will keep growing. American population growth is a combination of the highest birthrate of any industrial country (2.01 children per female) and our willingness to accept immigration. Mr. Wattenberg projects that the United States will continue to grow in economic and other forms of power, while Europe and Japan decline dramatically. Indeed, in the Wattenberg vision of the future, there are only three large nations by 2050: China, India and the United States.<br /><br />This is a book that should lead to very profound discussions, given its implications for pension programs in Europe and Japan, its implications for economic development throughout the world and its implications for environmental management and an honest assessment of the future.<br /><br />Finally, this book is a tribute to the continued, persistent willingness of Mr. Wattenberg to take facts as they are presented and follow them without an ideological or political agenda. Hopefully it will lead many policy-makers to think deeply about how much the future will differ from their current expectations and then to ask how those differences should change American and world policies.ssessment of the future. <br /> <br />Finally, this book is a tribute to the continued, persistent willingness of Mr. Wattenberg to take facts as they are presented and follow them without an ideological or political agenda.

His analogy of the differences between Los Angeles and Las Vegas as the differences between hope and desire (with hope being desirable and raw desire being potentially destructive) makes it obvious that Connelly is someone who reflects on life in a variety of different ways.  As does his analogy of the Los Angeles River's `narrows' - the normally dry concrete walls that occasionally flood with the full power of a western flashflood - as a parallel to the flood of evil that can sometimes threaten to drown us.<br /><br />In this novel, the ex-FBI agent, mass-murderer first encountered in \\"The Poet\\" has reappeared in a deliberate and systematic effort to trap his former prot&eacute;g&eacute; from his time as head of the serial murderer division of the FBI.<br /><br />The adeptness in which Connelly handles the complexities of weaving together people from two streams of his own work is a beauty to behold.  Page after page, you will find yourself drawn into situations you had never considered - bureaucratic infighting in law enforcement at its most normal and people caught up in the pressures of their jobs, their passions, and their humanity.	2004-09-30

From the opening, the action scenes are remarkable and non stop and Dirk Pitt continues to be one of the great James Bond-like adventures figures of our time.<br /><br />Cussler's use of the ocean and the history of ocean travel make his books unique among adventure stories.  He has also mastered the art of weaving a variety of themes into one compelling action-filled narrative. In this volume we go back and forth from the Vikings in the eleventh century to Jules Verne and the Nautilus in the 19th century to a giant cruise ship being sabotaged with thousands of lives at stake in 2003.<br /><br />All of this is tied into a giant corporate conspiracy which seems a little more plausible after Enron and other recent scandals. You will be kept guessing on at least three different fronts as Pitt and his team rush from problem to problem and from threat to threat.<br /><br />The action never stops; the entertainment never stops.	2004-09-22

It begins with the murder of Rinker's boyfriend in Mexico.  Being a member of the Mexican mafia, the man's family believes his death was simply a hit, but Rinker knows better - it was a botched attack on her.  She travels back home to the United States both out of a desire for revenge and to protect her own life.  Rinker knows not only that they will come after her again, but that if her boyfriend's Mexican mafia family realizes their son was killed during a hit on her, they'll come after her in retaliation.<br /><br />Her return to the United States does not go unnoticed by the FBI.  Davenport is called in to track her down, leading to a wonderful escape-suspense-pursuit story that keeps you turning the pages.<br /><br />I like Sandford's writing and I read everything he writes featuring Davenport.  For the uninitiated, Mortal Prey is a great place to begin reading in the `Prey' series.  And of course, fans of the earlier books will enjoy this one.	2004-09-10

By chronicling the history of constitutional interpretation, Kramer makes clear that the Founding Fathers decisively rejected judicial supremacy.<br /><br />He explains how Jeffersonians learned to distrust English judges when they represented the King's tyranny, and later learned to distrust district judges when the Federalists passed the Alien and Sedition Acts and locked up Jeffersonian activists.<br /><br />When the Federalists lost the election of 1800, they more than doubled the number of Federal circuit judges, appointing 18 Federalists during the lame-duck Congress of 1801. In response, Jefferson simply eliminated the 18 judgeships that the Federalists had created.<br /><br />Kramer makes the case that Marbury v. Madison, which established the principle of judicial review, must be read within the context of this presidential-legislative assault on the judiciary. Jefferson often repudiated the notion of judicial supremacy, claiming it would create \\"an oligarchy.\\" Kramer convincingly argues that Justice John Marshall was careful not to assert judicial supremacy in the 1803 decision so as to avoid a conflict with the president and the Congress he knew he could not win. But today, Kramer continues, law schools explicitly misread that event and use it to create lawyers who arrogate to themselves far more power than the Constitution provides.<br /><br />Kramer blames the recent rise of judicial supremacy theory on the Warren Court. He notes that the Warren Court judges actually signed an ad asserting judicial supremacy and profoundly misrepresented Marbury v. Madison.<br /><br />The book's strength is its combination of historic detail with Kramer's clear distinction between interpreting the meaning of the Constitution and interpreting the meaning of ordinary law. He makes clear that the Founding Fathers felt that it was the people who would decide the interpretation of the Constitution through their elected officials, not appointed lawyers through their decisions.<br /><br />Kramer notes that the Dred Scott decision, far from proving judicial supremacy, led to a Civil War in which the American people decisively repudiated the Court's position. He argues that FDR won the fight with the Supreme Court in 1937 because the judges shifted their opinions to avoid having the Court packed. And Kramer asserts it was the Warren Court which unilaterally ended this balance of power established in 1937 and sought to make the Supreme Court preeminent over the Legislative and Executive branches.<br /><br />Kramer's book provides ammunition for those tired of appointed lawyers on benches rewriting the Constitution.<br /><br />A president and Congress who represent the will of 91 percent of the people (the number who favor keeping \\"under God\\" in the Pledge of Allegiance) could eliminate those judges on the Ninth Circuit who were so out of touch with America that they ruled it unconstitutional.<br /><br />Furthermore, the Congress and the president can combine to block the courts from even considering cases on the Pledge, school prayer, marriage and other topics the American people overwhelmingly favor.<br /><br />Kramer has written a manual on how the American people can legitimately exercise their historic right to create what he calls popular constitutionalism.far more power than the Constitution provides.  <br /> <br />Kramer blames the recent rise of judicial supremacy theory on the Warren Court.

Throughout the story, one of Burdett's strengths is his ability to capture the intangibles of culture. Consider this insight:<br /><br />\\"In the beginning was the Word. But it was sung, not spoken. Prehistoric humans from Peking Man in the East to Cro Magnon in the West used the full range of the vocal scale to sing instructions for the hunt, sing guidance to their children, sing reverence to the gods that provided the mammoths. They would have despised the flat, dead speech of modern times for the tuneless whitterings of ghosts.....the oldest language in modern usage is also the most musical. With nine tones to condition meaning, Cantonese can present a challenge to a tin ear from the Bronx.\\" (p.283)<br /><br />Burdett uses Richard Hughes' formula of 'a borrowed place living on borrowed time' to explain the psychological challenge Hong Kong residents face during the last six million seconds before they return to Chinese control.<br /><br />The criminal activities of the People's Liberation Army, including their willingness to use violence and intimidation to create rigged enrichment for a small handful of Generals, are described in accurate details. Burdett even uses official United Nations reports to enhance the sense of realism. He also manages to weave through all this the issue of the Laogai--the prison/slave labor system by which 50,000,000 people live lives of enslavement in China, according to Burdett.<br /><br />Burdett's protagonist is a driven Chinese-Irish policeman seeking answers to the brutal deaths of two Chinese men and an American girl. The journey is worth the read. Indeed I am beginning to believe that anything John Burdett writes is worth reading.	2004-08-16

Opening in immediate postwar Berlin with the Gestapo strengthening its grip and the Jewish population steadily being herded toward the Holocaust, it carries the reader through the German invasion of Poland, the collapse of the Polish Army, and the invasion from the east by Stalin. Furst is able to paint a horrifying portrait of the brutality and seeming senselessness of Stalin's purges and the ruthlessness of the Gestapo's anti-foreigner forces but at the same time able to create compelling portraits of well meaning, likeable people trying to work out a chance for survival as the world closes in. Consider this passage:<br /><br /> &quot;Because now everything was different. Bloch had met a certain kind of man on the train to Prague but now he was not that man. He was instead that man who presses his face against the skin of a woman to inhale such fragrance as makes him want to cry out with joy. He was that man who spins between tenderness and raging lust like a helpless top, who wakes up on fire every morning, who spends his hours thinking of only one thing--yet how brilliantly he thinks of it!&quot;<br /><br /> A man who can write of personal love like that and still describe Stalin, Beira Yezhov, the Gestapo and the whole horror of the times is a man worth reading.<br /><br /> Anyone seeking to understand the horrors of Iraq, Syria, Libya, Iran, and North Korea should read Furst's books. In the end, the horror of one man or woman being destroyed and tortured by another within a state system of power is remarkably the same even if the reason is different. Furst clearly grasps this larger moral issue: \\"...Hitler wasn't mad, he was evil,\\" he writes. \\"And that was a notion educated people didn't like, it offended their sense of the rational world. Yet it was true. And just as true of his mirror image, Stalin.&quot;<br /><br /> This is the insight that made Churchill historic and Chamberlain impotent in dealing with evil. This is the insight that enabled Ronald Reagan to bring down the Soviet Union. And it is this kind of insight that makes Alan Furst worth reading.e writes. \\"And that was a notion educated people didn't like, it offended their sense of the rational world. Yet it was true.

His books are useful to stretch your mind and connect events and ideas that you would not automatically have put in the same category.<br /><br />In this volume from his Joint Task Force series, a group of Americans have spent the last few years building a settlement in Liberia and are trying to retire to a community that would help their ancestral land while allowing them to enjoy life when a group of Islamic fanatics begin taking over Liberia and killing all the Americans.  Among the retired Americans is an African American General with strong combat experience and his top sergeant.<br />Meanwhile, off the American coast, a Navy-Marine Joint Task Force is experimenting with a new generation of experimental unmanned fighter aircraft (think predators but much more agile) when it is assigned the immediate challenge of rescuing the Americans in Liberia before the marauding Islamists massacre them.  Additionally, the French have decided to intervene with a stronger Naval force and since no American aircraft carrier is in the area, think they will have the dominant force necessary to humiliate the Americans.<br /><br />The interspersing of Americans trying to survive in Liberia, fighter experimentation at the cutting edge, a tense standoff with an 'ally' and the Navy-Marine determination to save their fellow citizens makes for a consistently interesting read.<br /><br />Simply stated, Meadows will have you turning pages and thinking new thoughts.	2004-03-25

A wide range of personal relationships also allowed the authors to interview many of the key participants immediately following the battles.<br />The Iraq War captures the audacity and daring of General Franks' campaign plan and the persistent boldness with which it was executed.  Also emphasized is the fact that the component commanders truly understood Franks' intent and, when in doubt, took risks and kept pushing the envelope for more speed and more surprise.<br />There are no gigantic revelations in the authors' account of Operation Iraqi Freedom and their assessment of what worked and what didn't; however, they highlight some principles that every sophisticated American should reflect upon when thinking about our future national security policies.  Several of these principles are covered in the remainder of this review.<br />Murray and Scales signify the human element in war and the stunning mismatch in technology, training, experience, and professionalism between the coalition and the Iraqis.  But once the fighting shifted into the existing guerilla phase, most of those advantages lost much of their force.<br />An implicit contrast is drawn between the Marine Corps system of every member being a rifleman and every convoy being expected to protect itself and the very different Army model of inadequately trained non-combat soldiers being protected by combat forces.  It is clear from their outline of events that the Marine Corps progress through the inhabited areas was actually much more challengeable than the third division's drive through the desert.  This is not to minimize the extraordinary speed and drive of the Army's flanking maneuver, but it does raise an interesting question about examining more carefully the Marine Corps doctrine for urban warfare (and their practice of policing areas with the support of local people).<br />The authors report favorably on the subtle, intelligence-led British effort to capture Basra with minimum casualties to the Shia and the way in which this effort made policing the city much easier.  Americans could gain an education from the British in the art of policing potentially hostile people.<br />The largest intelligence failure of the war was our underestimation of the power of the Baathist secret police and the torture system they employed to force others to continue fighting against us.  This mistake was compounded by the fact that we didn't comprehend the bitterness that the Shia people had harbored toward us since 1991.  In that year, they rebelled at what they thought was President George H.W. Bush's suggestion and then 50,000 were slaughtered by Saddam's forces, while the U.S. did nothing.  In the early stages of the Iraq war, these people were restrained by a palpable fear that we would not persist, and they would not risk helping us until they were confident that our troops were there for the duration.<br />The role of the Syrians and other hostile forces is undeniably clear.  One example cited is &quot;the enemy was far more skilled ... Hornbuckle was later to learn that most of the attacking fedayeen were not Iraqis but Syrian jihadists who had made the trip to Baghdad specifically to kill Americans; out of the thirty POWs captured on Curly, twenty-eight were Syrians.&quot; (p. 215)<br />This and other references raise not only the question of why the Syrian dictatorship was allowing them to enter Iraq but also speculate where these enemies were being trained, since it their training was clearly superior to that of their Iraqi counterparts.<br />A succinct description of the second campaign requirements to rebuild a new system of safety, health, prosperity, and freedom are worth being read by every American:<br />&quot;Success in this new war will not be gauged by how many Republican Guard tanks are destroyed but by the less tangible and quantifiable measurement of people's acceptance of a new Iraqi leadership.

Niles and Dobson come through on both counts.<br /><br />At its premise, this book takes that the effort to kill Hitler in July 1944 succeeds but leads Himmler to take power and gamble on making peace with the Soviet Union.  His temptation for Stalin is knowledge of the vengeance weapons and the technology to make the Soviet Union potentially dominant against the Western Allies.<br /><br />That truce (and both sides know it is a truce not a peace) allows Germany to focus on defeating the Anglo-American armies.<br /><br />They then posit that Himmler would have relied on competent military leaders like Rommel, Guderian and Galland and amassed German military power more intelligently than Hitler allowed.<br /><br />The book evolves in a very engaging and satisfying way and I recommend it highly for anyone interested in how a military campaign could unfold and how strategic change could lead to different developments.	2004-02-27

I am totally captivated by Spenser but find myself growing more and more fond of the Jesse Stone novels.<br /><br />In this case, a couple that is entirely ruthless and gets their kicks from killing strangers has moved into Stone's small town. As police chief, Stone is faced with tracking down very smart people who have developed a method for identifying and killing people that does not require them to make any significant mistakes or leave any evidence.<br /><br />The couple begins to be fascinated with the idea of killing Stone; the plot thickens.<br /><br />In the middle of all this, Stone continues to long for his ex-wife and continues to date without the ability to commit.  He struggles with the amount of alcohol he uses to compensate for the emptiness he feels from living without his ex-wife.<br />Parker has written a number of times about the power of being committed so deeply to someone that you have no choice but to live it out (most powerfully in Love and Glory). Stone Cold takes a deep step into that territory and does it while spinning a very good mystery story.	2004-02-11

(In a sense that is what a lifetime of leadership training and experience is all about--creating leaders who can determine which hunches they have to follow and which they should avoid.)<br /><br />America can project a lot of power because countries like Turkey, Britain, Israel and individual people in many of other countries are willing to work with us. The morning this is not true, we will be a dramatically weaker and more vulnerable nation.<br /><br />As you read in the daily papers about the level of surprise in the 17 years that Iranians have been lying about their nuclear program or the revelation that Libya was much closer to building a nuclear bomb than experts had projected, you will find the Jericho Sanction reads a little more like daily events and a little less like fiction	2004-01-29

Where General Westmoreland and the senior Army favored large units sweeping across areas and hunting for large Vietcong forces, the Marines had developed a small unit action program, which was uniquely effective.<br /><br />\\"The Village\\" is about one squad of Marines in Binh Nghia village (actually a collection of villages numbering about 6,000 people.)  As Bing West notes, \\"This is the story of fifteen Marines who lived and fought for two years inside a Vietnamese village. There was shooting almost every night: from across the river a seasoned Viet Cong battalion attacked repeatedly.  In the village, the South Vietnamese farmers planted rice during the day and after dusk patrolled with the Marines....at the height of the Vietnam War a dozen U.S. Marines did live in the village and were generally accepted by 6,000 Vietnamese farmers.\\"<br />West was sent by the Marine Corps to study this process in 1966. He writes, this is \\"what war is like when you fight guerrillas, and of how Americans behaved when they volunteered to fight among the people. It was a bloody and intensely personal war.\\"  West went back to the village in 2002 and has a new closing chapter on the memories of Americans that remain despite a generation of Communist dictatorship.<br /><br />This book is a useful introduction to policing in third world settings and establishing security through small-unit, intensely local efforts that build knowledge of the community and a network of personal relationships.<br /><br />Anyone interested in better understanding how to win societal wars at the tactical level will find this a helpful book.al level will find this a helpful book.	2004-01-14

I had never read him before but found his writing so interesting that I am now looking for his other six novels.<br />In \\"Blood of Victory,\\" Furst creates an &eacute;migr&eacute; writer who has fled Stalin's Russia and is living in a Nazis occupied Paris. He is safe but oppressed.  It is 1940 and the German-Soviet Pact is still working. Occupied Paris is not a happy place.<br />We first encounter I.A. Serebin boarding a boat from Romania to Turkey and find one of the interesting realities in modern civilization; travel is essential.  For countries to operate people must travel and so even in a dictatorship, passage is possible if the right papers can be acquired. Ultimately, Serebin is convinced to help the British attempt to block the Danube, preventing German access to the Romanian oil that is key to their remaining both militarily and industrially functional.<br />Seeing the world from Istanbul, Bucharest, Paris and Belgrade shortly before the 1941 German attack is a new twist on the Second World War in the tradition of Eric Ambler and other spy chroniclers.<br />This is an intellectual's book (I hope I have not hurt its sales with that phrase) that carries you into a world of smart, reflective people living lives as refugees, intellectuals and activists trying to accomplish something.  It is your experience of their personalities and their interactions in interesting and exotic settings, not the James Bond style heroics, which carry the book.<br />It is worth reading for the portrait of the fight between the Iron Shirt fascist movement and the Romanian dictatorship and, in a very Ambler-like tradition, it has vivid believable scenes of street fighting and random civilian casualties that feel all too real.<br />\\"Blood of Victory\\" has proven Furst is worth getting to know and I have already found two more of his works for the near future	2003-12-29

Each founding father plays an essential role in our becoming an independent republic. Washington is the titan of moral authority on whose integrity our nation rests. Jefferson is the brilliant writer and theorist who helped create modern politics. Madison's systematic hard work created the system of legislative power and constitutional authority that protects our freedoms.  Hamilton's understanding of economics and social forces established the capitalist structure, which has made this the wealthiest society in history.<br />Yet in the deepest sense, these great men were pre-American. They belonged to an earlier, different era where most were landed gentry. Even Hamilton longed for the stability of monarchy.<br /><br />Only Franklin personified the striving, ambitious, rising system of individual achievement, hard work, thrift and optimism found at the heart of the American spirit. Only Franklin worked his way up in the worlds of business and organized political power in both colonial and national periods. Only Franklin was a world-renowned scientist, founder of corporations, inventor of devices and creator of the American mythos of the common man.<br /><br />Gordon Wood's &quot;The Radicalism of the American Revolution&quot; caught intellectually this sudden shift from the stable, serious gentry who dominated the founding to the wild, energetic, boisterous Jacksonians who came to define the American ethos.<br /><br />Franklin is the precursor to the Jacksonians.  He personified, literally lived, the American dream and then captured it in an amazingly self aware, fun to read autobiography, which may be the first great book of the American civilization.<br /><br />Isaacson has captured and portrayed Franklin in all his glory and complexity. This is a book worth giving any of your friends who would better understand America or any foreigner who wonders at our energy, our resilience, our confidence and our success.American civilization.<br /> <BR>Isaacson has captured and portrayed Franklin in all his glory and complexity.

I read one of Lee Child's books and was so struck with his character, Jack Reacher, and the lean, elegant style of Child's writing that I read all seven novels nonstop.<br />Since this is his newest novel, it might be the first one you find, but I believe you will enjoy the series more if you track down the first volume, &quot;Killing Floor,&quot; and then read each of the seven in succession.<br />In &quot;Persuader,&quot; Jack Reacher has the jolting discovery of evil nemesis Ouinn's existence, whom Reacher thought he had eliminated a decade ago.  To be ultimately rid of Quinn, Reacher faces a dual challenge -- penetrate an organized crime operation and aid the Federal government in the rescue of one of its agents.<br />Reacher's engaging narration is a combination of strategic thinking and forceful explosion, which is a brilliant juxtaposition.  Jack Reacher is a loner, without fear, and without surrender - and his intense drive will lead him to settle the score.<br />Tension, mayhem, and action are propelled throughout Child's novels.  This is definitely among the finest adventure fiction being written in America today.	2003-10-29

If you enjoy complex stories, captivating personalities, and a steady pace of action, Stuart Woods creates an exceptional read.  &quot;Dirty Work&quot; is also an unwitting case study into the peculiar mindset of modern liberalism.<br />Stone Barrington, the wealthy lawyer/ex-cop who is the protagonist of a number of Woods' recent novels, ends up hunting down a terrorist/assassin and ultimately decides to help her survive.  Barrington is angry that the British are trying to kill this assassin, although she has been killing and adopting their agents' identities.  The assassin is upset because the British have killed her parents.<br />Read the novel carefully and note how many innocent people die.  Then note that Barrington is upset about the assassin's imminent death but not about the deaths of all the people she has killed.  Through this view, you will catch the strange world of modern liberalism and how it rationalizes a selective morality that focuses only on the wrongs it wants to right.<br />&quot;Dirty Work&quot; is not only an intriguing novel but also a great study into the mindset of the modern left.	2003-10-08

The question becomes who is the one being chased?  Horvath and Cassidy persist on a fast and deliberate pace as they cross continents playing a deadly game of cat and mouse.<br />Thor's work is particularly credible because he uses real enemies of America, religious fanatics who want to destroy our way of life, which offers a refreshing change from focusing on the deranged American or Nazi businessman as cast by Hollywood and the cultural elite.

Ken Follett entered the world of the resistance in his last novel, Jackdaws, (which I reviewed favorably last year).  In that novel, the adventure occurred in occupied France and involved trained professionals with a very specific assignment.<br />Hornet Flight is equally satisfying but of a totally different and, in some ways, much more complex fabric.  The scene is occupied Denmark.  The primary viewpoint is from a high school student who is slowly drawn into the Nazi resistance without training or coordination by superiors.  The novel unfolds as part mystery, part adventure, part war story and, charmingly, part a coming-of-age story of a young man and woman who find each other.<br />This book also contains a haunting pattern of family feuds, a policeman gone sour because his family has been publicly humiliated and who sees a chance to use his authority to get even, and young people who want to get on with their lives but find the war overwhelming and forcing them into dangerous (and fatal in at least two cases) contact with a larger and more vicious world.<br />Follett ably presents the crisis Churchill faced with the improvement in German anti-bomber defenses at the very moment of the Soviet Union invasion, creating an opportunity for Britain to have a new ally.  The British were in a life and death struggle, the Danes had been defeated but still retained flashes of resistance, and the Nazis were at the peak of their self-assurance and arrogance.<br />This is a very nice novel, worth reading as a well-told story and as a reminder that at key crises, the actions of individuals and the courage of a few really do matter.	2003-04-09

In \\"Bird's-Eye View\\" he ensnares you in the life of Fritz Tullis, an up and coming history professor whose life is in disarray.<br />This disillusioned, even shattered, young man (maybe I identify as a former assistant history professor) buries himself in the Maryland swamps around his family home and between booze, marijuana and taking pictures of birds attempts to get his life back together.<br />Fritz discovers a whooping crane, the most famous endangered species in the United States, has shown up in his swamp among sandhill cranes and he comes back again and again to take pictures of this extraordinary bird.<br />While photographing the cranes he sees a mysterious airplane land on a private field across the waterway and on an impulse starts taking pictures.  He ends up photographing a murder.  Soon we learn that the airstrip is owned by an assistant secretary of state and the victim is an important foreign dignitary.<br />This is a well written, suspenseful and very human interest focused book that captures both the Chesapeake Bay area as well as the complex struggle 21st century men and women face trying to find companionship and continuity.<br />Suspenseful till the end, \\"Bird's-Eye View\\" is both a good read and thought provoking.	2003-02-22

The American tradition that we are informed by our past but defined by our future was never clearer than in the months of the Civil War's ending.<br />As he notes in the beginning of his book, most civil wars do not end with reconciliation and reunion but rather hostility and divisiveness. Northern Ireland, the Balkans and Lebanon are just three examples of conflicts in which bloodshed has borne bitterness and bitterness has led to more bloodshed.<br />Winik sets out to understand the reality that America's civil war ended very differently.<br />Building his theme around the events of April 1865, particularly the surrender of Lee and the assassination of Lincoln, Winik examines the uniquely American process of conquest and reconciliation proceeding side by side.<br />Winik carries the reader through a tour de force review of the first hundred years of American history, the personalities that dominated the Civil War and the patterns that resulted in reconciliation rather than permanent bitterness.<br />At the center of this story are the beliefs and actions of Lincoln, Lee and Grant.  In each case the leader chose forgiveness and the future over revenge and the past.<br />Winik explores how the bias toward building a new nation overcame even the anger and rage that followed Lincoln's assassination. He also shows how Lee was the true moral leader of the South through the decision of other military<br />leaders to follow Lee's example of orderly surrender and reconciliation rather than Jefferson Davis' call for guerrilla war and endless violence.  The military leaders of the Confederacy heeded Lee's wisdom and the path toward a more hostile, more bitter America, was averted.<br />Similarly, it was implementing Lincoln's directive that led Grant to a surrender of honor, dignity and compassion at Appomattox. Grant understood that if years of bloodshed were to be avoided Lee had to have enough dignity to be able to effectively lead and his men had to have enough resources to be hopeful.<br />Winik's perceptive understanding is captured in many memorable insights. Writes Winik: \\"In the end it is not brilliance but judgment that separates the great leaders from the routine.\\"  This is just one of the many themes Winik successfully articulates.  These themes are applicable to both past and current American leadership. For instance, those who would understand the difference between Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush might ponder the value of judgment over glibness.<br />How did America become the nation it is today and how did Americans become the people they are?  These are the questions Winik successfully examines in a book worth reading by those who seek to understand history and especially by those who seek to shape history.<br />I look forward to Winik's next book.bloodshed were to be avoided Lee had to have enough dignity to be able to effectively lead and his men had to have enough resources to be hopeful.<br />Winik's perceptive understanding is captured in many memorable insights.

The author is described as \\"a senior U.S. intelligence officer with nearly two decades of experience in national security issues related to Afghanistan and South Asia.\\" He was forced to publish the book anonymously because it is so different from the pre-September 11 analysis of his employing agency.<br />His own disgust with the American intelligence bureaucracy is evident in his acknowledgments when he cites Mark Helprin about men who \\"knowing very little or next to nothing, take pride in telling everyone else what to do.\\" He continues with praise for young civil servants \\"whose work ethic, intellectual honesty, and personal courage inspire awe and-if unleashed-are more than match for America's foes, foreign or domestic.  Too often, however, their work is stymied by senior officers of my own generation. Mostly men, these senior officers have made careers by keeping silent in the face of unfairness, avoiding risk, and refusing to make decisions . . . Fortunately, most of the Republic's younger civil servants recognize with Helprin that this behavior is `more than a pity, more than a disgrace, it is despicable'\\" (xiv).<br />The current strategy of focusing narrowly on Al Qaeda, Bin Laden, and body counts \\"is the road to disaster, for the positions and force bin Laden has presented are a far more lethal and varied threat than that posed by any of those we have labeled as `terrorists'  over the past quarter century. The strength of his personality and message is likely to lead to an enduring legacy that will long survive his departure from the scene\\" (xvii).<br />\\"The forces of bin Laden, then, are waging war on America in God's name; they have made it clear that their goal is not the tactical one of inflicting pain, but the strategic one of defeating the United States `in the same way in which the USSR suffered humiliation at the hands of the Afghan and Arab mujahedin in Afghanistan.' In the United States before the events of 11 September 2001, however, there was almost no recognition that bin Laden's war is well under way. The first step in countering the forces that bin Laden has established is to listen more patiently to what he said in the past and to understand the personal, historical, and geopolitical contexts in which he thought, spoke, and acted\\" (xviii).<br />Americans will find this book disturbing in part because the author uses American revolutionary war patriots' words to frame each chapter. His point is to drive home that the sincerity and intensity of our founding fathers can be matched by equal intensity and sincerity in Islam. He is arguing that the movement opposing us has a religious fervor, a systematic intensity, and a willingness to learn and use the advantages of a free society to defeat that very freedom.<br />This is a sobering view of a deeply religious movement with the passionate commitment of those who are doing God's bidding and a willingness to kill Americans by the millions if they can find the right mechanism with which to do it.<br />Anyone who reads this book will be deeply sobered by it and will reflect on how much bigger and longer our campaign to defeat the Reactionary Islamists will turn out to be.ed humiliation at the hands of the Afghan and Arab mujahedin in Afghanistan.'

Thus, while Woodward's books are in a gray zone between reporting and writing history, they are often worth reading.<br />Bush at War is a useful book for any citizen who is interested in how President George W. Bush operates, the manner in which he leads a team of strong men and women, and the ways in which that team, coordinated by National Security Adviser Condi Rice, interacts to produce and implement public policy.<br />Woodward's biggest weakness is the degree to which he interviews and writes as though a worldwide anti-terrorist campaign could be understood from a Washington-only perspective. General Tommy Franks and the Central Command in Tampa, Florida, played a much bigger role in liberating Afghanistan and helping create new alliances than is indicated in this book. General Franks' ability to lead 47 allies in Tampa (each with their own trailer and national flag in the largest coalition in history) is one of the marvels of the last year and gets virtually no Washington coverage.<br />Woodward's other failure is the classic liberal bias that a profoundly conservative President willing to stand up for America's interests has to be \\"educated\\" into more \\"sophisticated\\" (meaning liberal) internationalist views.<br />Nothing in the text of the book (which shows Bush as remarkably strong and clear and capable of managing a very strong team) would indicate that there is a struggle for the President's heart and mind with Powell representing the forces of light while Cheney and Rumsfeld somehow represent the forces of darkness. Yet that is the final editorial bias of the end of the book.<br />Despite these caveats this is a good book worthy of every citizen reading it to get a better understanding of the war we are in.heney and Rumsfeld somehow represent the forces of darkness.

Every one of his books is worth reading as a vivid, compelling story.<br />In Sleep No More he creates a story of the supernatural worthy of Stephen King. It is an eerie story of young love, death, a family, and threats almost beyond imagining. It is a murder mystery, a love story, and an account that at times seems to verge on insanity. At every page you will find yourself drawn deeper and deeper into the plot and more and more curious about how it will end.  The plotting for the last third of the book continues to build in intensity until you can't put it down until you finish.<br />I have to admit that I had no idea how the conflict would be resolved and found the conclusion very satisfying but the story very troubling. If the supernatural frightens you, this book may be too much. On the other hand if it intrigues you, then you should rush down to your bookstore and buy Sleep No More.  If you just like interesting personalities and fascinating stories, anything by Greg Iles is worth reading.  This book continues that high standard.	2002-12-13

You will also have a new appreciation of the gap between an embassy staff trying to understand the surface of a culture and the depth of experience and knowledge that is required to begin to truly understand another society.<br />In fact, this book is as useful in helping to understand Japan in 1941 as it is for trying to understand our current challenge in dealing with the reactionary Wahhabi sect of Islam, the system of terror based on religious belief, and the isolation of Hezballah, Hamas, and Al Qaeda from the West. The core principle that language is only the first of many cultural differences is the key to understanding the challenge facing any diplomat or intelligence agent trying to penetrate and predict a truly different society.<br />Martin Cruz Smith has created an American missionary's son who is as vivid and believable as any of the Russians in his Gorky Park series. Smith suggests that a young man who had grown up inside Japanese culture with Japanese playmates and fluency in the Japanese language would have a completely different understanding of the culture than the American embassy or missionaries who came as outsiders to change it rather than understand it.<br />Smith creates an almost Humphrey Bogart like character in an almost Casablanca scene but with distinctly Japanese differences. He tells the story of a culture that believes in seppuku (ceremonial suicide), a culture which saw everyone not Japanese as not quite human (and therefore saw the killing of hundreds of thousands of Chinese as an event not worth noticing), and a culture which felt its very life being suffocated by the huge presence of the Americans across the Pacific and their potential ability to strangle Japanese society by cutting off the flow of oil.  This is a culture very unlike Vichy, France and even more alien than the Gestapo and the Third Reich.<br />You will find the personalities, the plot, and the scenes believable, engaging, and intriguing.

Sunny is a divorced private eye who seems to want to get back with her ex. Holly is retired Army turned small town police chief who recently lost her fianc&eacute; on their wedding day but is still looking for an interesting and exciting man.<br />Both characters have good relationships with their fathers. Both seem pretty smart. Holly is more capable of taking care of herself but also seems to get in trouble against more vicious, more numerous, and better armed opponents.<br />The differences are as great as the similarities. Sunny works the Boston area. Holly is on Florida's east coast. Sunny is a loner who occasionally works with the local police usually through an ex-boyfriend. Holly has an entire (albeit small) department to manage, engages in professional police procedures and has the usual strained local police-Federal Bureau of Investigation tensions.<br />In this novel Stuart Woods does a very believable job of setting up a conspiracy to defraud millions that involves three killings, some real estate being auctioned by the federal government, and an insider who has decided the federal pension just won't be good enough.<br />From the time the first developer's body is discovered (page two) through the killing of a golfing-developer at the Doral golf course in Miami (page four), and until the final resolution of the case and the FBI's reassessment of its role, you will find each new twist unpredictable and each new personality worth getting to know.

At one level it is a romantic novel of a man who refuses to give up on life despite some brutally hard lessons (including watching his brother being beaten to death as a teenager by fascists in his Bulgarian village and being trained into the Soviet intelligence system at a time of tremendous brutality to ordinary humans).<br />Furst's specialty is the man or woman who is trying to find a way to have a decent breakfast, adequate clothing, and a warm dry room to live in and yet who finds the draw of other people irresistible and the overhanging violence of the era a permanent background against which life is lived. He is able both to make the personal important and yet also to acknowledge the powerful reality of tides that were shaping history and changing lives.<br />Furst is a romantic realist in the best sense of the Americans who fought the Second World War with ferocity and determination for the best of ideals. He is vividly aware that brutality exists and can destroy lives but is unwilling to allow that to crush his spirit or make him less human. The horror exists but it is not definitive as long as humans insist on hope and love.<br />This is a superb work and the kind history classes could use to help their students understand that behind all those facts were warm and passionate people who mattered both individually and in the larger sense of history.	2002-10-29

This conspiracy is discovered by accident when two lawyers, one representing the timber interests and the other representing the anti-timber environmentalists meet secretly for a pay off and have their half million hijacked. While chasing the robbers they discover the secret Japanese operation, and from that point on their lives are in danger.<br />The complexities of environmental-forestry emotions, the uses of the news media, the nature of the marijuana growing underworld of rural northern California, and the ruthlessness of people who make a living killing others all come together in a well told story.<br />It is a little hard for me to enjoy a story in which both the hero and heroine are lawyers, but David Dun got me to do it. His characters are real enough; their personalities seem true enough, and their actions are realistic enough that I grew to like them even though both had passed the bar.

It is the tale of a 14-year-old girl who disappears and is found dead and the complex unraveling of who killed her and why.<br />The mystery is made far more complex by having the defense lawyer be the former star prosecutor who left town when it turned out a man he had sent to the electric chair was innocent. His wife also left him for another man because he was ignoring her for work, and she was desperate to have children before she was too old.<br />The interaction between the prosecutor-turned-defense attorney and his former law enforcement colleagues turned opponents, combined with the steadily increasing complexity of a legal case that grows more interesting with each page will keep you glued to the book.<br />J.F. Freedman has a wonderful knack for writing dialogue and scenes that come alive and developing characters (both good and bad) that you really want to know about and understand. This is superb entertainment, and its commentary on today's teenagers and their neglectful parents will leave you thinking long after you have finished reading.	2002-10-10

I like it for three major reasons:<br />First, it gives us a human scale story of people trying to change history by specific actions.<br />Second, it reminds us that the Pope, President Reagan, and Prime Minister Thatcher showed real courage and real determination in taking on the evil empire of the Soviet Union.<br />Third, it may reach a younger generation who has grown up since the fall of the Soviet Union and for whom this is unknown ground (certainly their news media and their academic experience will have done nothing to teach them about an evil empire, a brave pope, or a heroic President and Prime Minister).<br />The story is straightforward. The Pope, the first Polish Pope in history, sends a letter to the Polish Communist dictatorship warning that if it continues to repress his people, he will step down as Pope and come home to suffer with them as their bishop-this from a man who had suffered under both Nazis and Communists before being elevated to Rome. Anyone who saw the Pope's recent pilgrimage home to Poland will appreciate his love of his home country and his people.<br />Andropov, the last decisive leader of the aging Soviet oligarchy decides that killing the Pope is the best way to deal with the threat. A young Soviet communications clerk cannot stand the crisis of conscience that the idea of killing the Pope creates for him and decides to defect. Then the race is on.<br />The story never slows, the people never cease to interest, and the sense of how history unfolded in this critical moment is powerful.<br />It is worth remembering: no Pope, no President Reagan, no Prime Minister Thatcher, no end to detente, no end to coexistence, no end to the Soviet Empire. This book is a nice reminder of that fact.	2002-10-03

In this novel a group of really bad people work overtime to kill an experienced Native American mountaineer and a female FBI agent. The combination of winter snowstorms, mountain adventures, and action scenes of real speed and complexity make for a very fast read.<br />Dun has a sense of survival in the winter in high mountains that makes the book worth reading just on those terms. His portrait of a very smart but urban FBI agent interacting with a Native American medical doctor who grew up in the area and really understands how to get around and how to survive is just a terrific story.<br />The bad guys are ruthless enough and serious enough that even with all the doctor's survival skills and the FBI training the duo faces very long odds in surviving. How they survive and then win will keep you turning the pages.<br />David Dun is off to a great start as an action writer. He has a quote from Clive Cussler on the cover, \\"escapist fiction of the first order,\\" and he may well prosper in acquiring new readers as Cussler has.	2002-09-10

This is the third of Clancy's military leadership books (the first two were with Chuck Horner and Fred Franks about the air and land campaigns in Iraq in 1991). They are a useful and very readable basic introduction to the American military as it has evolved over the last decade. In a few years, Clancy will have to start a new series on the ongoing transformation of defense and the military that will emerge from that process. For the moment, these books are invaluable as insightful reports on a generation of effort.<br />Stiner's reports on the early years of the terrorist wars (the mid 1980s when he was in the Middle East and Don Rumsfeld was the special Ambassador for President Reagan) and on the ambiguity and even opposition from Italy and Egypt to our efforts to capture terrorists gives you a better understanding of how we drifted into 9/11.<br />Stiner's explanation of the rise of Special Forces and the necessity for President Kennedy and Congress to impose the concept of Special Forces on the Army and then impose a Special Operations Command on the entire system is a powerful reminder that large military bureaucracies almost never reform themselves. It is a useful introduction to the fights currently underway to transform the military.<br />Stiner's frustrations with the regular military and especially the regular Army in trying to get the right use of Special Forces in Iraq and Kuwait in 1990-1991 and reflection on the extraordinary use of both CIA teams and SOF teams in Afghanistan are reminders of what modern enlightened military commanders can do when they stretch their thinking.<br />Finally, Stiner's account of the Special Forces' contribution to the survival of Kurds in northern Iraq is a vivid reminder of what we could be doing in Afghanistan and in Colombia if we were willing to design a sustainable, affordable fulfillment strategy the right way and use our specialists along the lines of their strengths.<br />As we continue to pursue Al Qaeda and confront anew our responsibilities around the world, this is a very useful book to reflect on what needs to be done.

I like Silva's earlier novels, but I did not like the level of violence described in the cover leaf. It sounded like a mindless adventure but not in the complex, intricate manner of Silva's earlier works.<br />I had underestimated Silva, or his publisher had misdescribed him. This is a delightful, deep tale of Swiss abuse of Nazi victims, a generation of Swiss cover-up to keep possession of the stolen goods, the Israeli effort to locate and track down the valuables from pre-World War II European Jews, and the level of violence some people will go to in order to keep what they have even if it was gained illicitly (or maybe even because it was gained illicitly).<br />Once you have entered the journey of the former Israeli agent turned art restorer and you have encountered the violence and mysteries which surround what should have been a simple trip to look at some art in need of repair, I think you will be as hooked as I was. The larger tale of what happened to Jewish and other goods during the Nazi era will also set you thinking and will put a human face to the stories several years ago of Swiss bank accounts and secrecy about the Second World War period.<br />This is a fascinating book and fully up to Silva's standards.	2002-08-05

When Frederick Forsyth writes about them, you will find yourself following every word and turning every page.<br />This is an absolutely remarkable collection of short stories running from the very realistic through the surprising to the supernatural.  His portrait of a saint in Sienna is brilliant and compelling, and the outcome of the story is stunning and memorable.  He provides a very satisfying explanation of who a murdered unknown person really is and how his identity affects the thugs who killed him.  The life of the only scout to survive Custer's last stand is told so grippingly that I could not stop from finishing it.<br />Forsyth simply has the wonderful knack for writing fiction so it seems real, personal, and meaningful. His writing carries you into a world of possibilities and will stretch your own thinking and enrich your understanding of life's possibilities.	2002-07-29

Kaplan begins his book with a glowing description of the River War and argues that those of us trying to deal with 21st century Afghanistan, Africa, Bosnia, etc., would do well to study the lessons in Churchill's report.<br />Churchill was a British officer who wrangled his way into Kitchener's campaign up the Nile through connections in high places and against Kitchener's wishes.  Kitchener was angry that a journalist-officer of Churchill's age (early 20s) would even presume to render judgment on the Generals and the government.<br />Churchill recounts the rise of the Mahdi, the defeat of Gordon at Khartoum, the decision of the government to retake the Sudan, and the careful preparations by Kitchener (in some ways a forerunner to Schwarzkopf's massing overwhelming force against Iraq in 1991).<br />There are a number of lessons in this book.  Churchill talks constantly of &quot;scientific warfare&quot; and the inability of the Mahdist forces to cope with it.  By &quot;scientific warfare&quot; he meant the telegraph, the railroad, the armored steamboat with cannon, the Maxim gun (an early machine gun), and the disciplined infantry squares.  It is helpful to be reminded that predators, B-2s, and Special Forces on horseback with laser designators are simply our generation's version of the \\"scientific war\\".<br />Churchill also points out how few British troops were engaged in the campaign.  The majority of the battalions were Egyptian and Sudanese with British officers.  Only a minority was British.  On the other hand, it was British communications, British logistics, British gunboats, and British firepower that made them dominant.  These were Egyptian and Sudanese troops officered by the British and trained to British standards, a lesson for Afghanistan and elsewhere.  In one expedition there were 1,300 men of whom only 7 were British.<br />This is a very useful book as we think about the complexities of the 21st century third world and its problems of poverty, violence, disorganization, and ruthless petty tyrants.we think about the complexities of the 21st century third world and its problems of poverty, violence, disorganization, and ruthless petty tyrants.	2002-07-22

Intelligence is a vital requirement for three objectives:  Knowing what your opponents are doing; deceiving your opponents about what you are doing; and using covert means to change or replace your opponents.<br />As Ambrose makes clear, Eisenhower was introduced to the world of intelligence by Winston Churchill and rapidly became fascinated with it.  His chief intelligence officer Kenneth Strong, a British General, kept him remarkably informed throughout the Second World War.  Ambrose argues, and he is almost certainly right, that only the combination of great intelligence about the Germans and the most successful deception plan in history made the invasion of France possible in 1944.  He also notes that deception had also been brilliantly used in 1943 to convince the Germans that the allies were going to invade Sardinia or Greece rather than Sicily.  The result was a reallocation of German forces to the wrong places, which weakened their forces in Sicily.<br />There are a lot of lessons in this book for our generation.  Eisenhower valued technology and took risks to develop it.  He knew how to undertake successful covert operations.  For anyone who would understand the uses of intelligence in the modern world, this is a useful book.	2002-07-18

He was named head of the United Nations Special Commission on Disarming Iraq.  Butler depicts the unwavering determination of the Iraqi government to acquire weapons of mass destruction.  He details the politics of Kofi Annan and the United Nations leadership as they tried to paper over Iraqi deceptions so as to achieve a diplomatic \\"victory\\" in the face of a startlingly different reality.  The ultimate triumph was handed to a very dangerous Saddam and a defeat to both the UN and the Clinton Administration.<br />Hitler's Mein Kampf explained Nazi Germany's future for those who would read it (as Churchill did).  Similarly, Butler brings his readers face to face with Hussein's twisted world.  He explains clearly what it is and why Saddam is working so hard to develop weapons of terrifying capability.<br />Butler illustrates a frightening Iraqi worldview captured best by Deputy Prime Minister Aziz who \\"had stated quite plainly that Iraq had used chemical weapons on Iran, that it maintained biological weapons, and that these were intended specifically for use against Israel.\\"  Aziz declares his government's vision of an Iraqi future \\"leading and defending\\" a united Arab world.  One that is \\"vigilant against the Persians in the Northwest and the Israelis in the Southwest\\".  In order to achieve this dominant role for Iraq \\"it had sought, obtained, used, and would use again in the future weapons of mass destruction.\\"<br />Butler asserts: \\"Iraq's main triumph was the removal of all disarmament inspections and the shutdown of all monitoring systems.\\"  Butler writes that many weapons were removed but \\"Saddam still satisfies the three criteria usually advanced in judging whether or not a crime was committed: motive, means, and opportunity.  He clearly continues to have the motive and means to threaten great danger, and now the opportunity for renewed weapons development, given the extended absence of international arms control in Iraq.\\"<br />Butler introduces Iraq in a chapter entitled \\"A Glimpse of Terror\\".  He recounts again and again the true character of Saddam's regime.  \\"Its brutal and tyrannical nature has been documented in detail for almost two decades.  The political currency of his regime is homicide, frequently threatened and often delivered, the callousness of the regime toward its own people--a quality we witnessed daily in our dealings with Iraq, something which gives the lie to Saddam's public protestations that his primary goal is to lift the awful burden of international sanctions from the backs of the Iraqi people.\\"  The truth is that he could get relief from sanctions, as Butler puts it, \\"at any time by giving up his weapons\\".  Saddam \\"has resolutely refused to do that, thus trading off the welfare of the Iraqi people.\\"  Butler is unequivocal in his indictment of his regime: \\"cruel, lying, intimidating, and determined to retain weapons of mass destruction--weapons capable of killing thousands, even millions at a single blow.\\"<br />Butler, who led his inspections team in Iraq, reveals in his findings on chemical weapons that \\"essentially Iraq made virtually all of the prohibited agents and used some of them both in and outside Iraq.  But VX was and is the most devastating of them.  It can be sprayed as a liquid or scattered into the atmosphere as an aerosol.  A missile warhead of the type Iraq has made and used can hold some 140 liters of VX,...enough of the chemical to kill up to 1 million people.  A single droplet on the skin constitutes a lethal dose.\\"  The UN has imposed a missile range limit on Iraq, \\"a limit Iraq is now breaching\\".  Iraq successfully protectedits secret chemical weapons program and \\"the overall size of Iraq's VX production remains unknown to this day.\\"<br />Butler draws an equally disturbing conclusion on biological weapons where he notes the \\"intelligence materials I had seen indicating that Iraq may have transferred some of its biological weapons equipment in shipping containers for safe storage in another country.\\"<br />Butler, who is pro-United Nations and pro-multilateralism, recount Iraq's propaganda efforts, the rise of a French-Chinese-Russian effort to lift the sanctions, the dishonesty of some of Kofi Annan's staff in trying to manipulate information, suppress reports of Iraqi behavior to help lift the sanctions.  Those who would reform the United Nations would do well to study Butler's account of internal maneuvering and manipulation.  It is an institution that should be taken seriously and should be made more transparent and more accountable.<br />Butler's logic is irrefutable, \\"weapons of mass destruction are fundamentally different from other threats to peace.  They cannot be the subject of politics as usual because of their capacity to destroy everything.\\"<br />We don't know exactly what is happening inside Iraq because \\"no one is watching Saddam Hussein.  You can be certain that he is not waiting idly for the UN to suddenly realize its fault.  He is building--building weapons, as are other rogue states...If a single missile loaded with nerve gas was to hit Tel Aviv, the world will never be the same.  If a single canister of VX was released into the New York City subway system, the world will never be the same.  If a single nuclear explosion hollowed out central London, the world will never be the same.\\"<br />The book opens and is concluded with this quote from Edmund Burke; \\"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing\\".

He currently has three different major characters (not counting one side journey into the life of Wyatt Earp) and Spenser is the longest-lived and most consistent of the three.  Jesse Stone is a former Los Angeles big city policeman turned small town police chief wrestling with alcoholism and loneliness.  Sunny Randall is a woman private investigator still in love with her ex husband but needing to be on her own to explore life.  They are both engaging but neither of them is Spenser.<br />For a generation Spenser has been wandering through Boston and the environs solving crimes, protecting the innocent, and sometimes just wandering.  Spenser, of course, is never really alone.  He is in love with Susan Silverman, a psychologist.  They have been together for 25 years as this story unfolds (which gives me a hint how long I have been hanging out with them).  Her dog is getting old and might someday soon have to be put away (a topic they discuss with more objectivity and less affection than I would like).<br />When things get difficult Spenser can call on Hawk, his African American sidekick and protector, for support.  There is always an undercurrent of Hawk being stronger and maybe even smarter but not as balanced as Spenser.<br />In Widow's Walk a very wealthy man has been killed and his wife is the obvious culprit.  Then her defense lawyer brings Spenser into the case and things begin to unravel.  I doubt if anyone who read the first four chapters could predict the ending.<br />Parker both keeps you absorbed with the story and comfortable with the usual characters and a few new suspects.<br />Someday someone will write an interesting book about the evolution of American society as seen through Spenser's lifetime.  This book is a good contribution to that experience.	2002-05-16

This is one of the finest studies of military bureaucracies rejecting change and protecting the old order that has ever been written.  Anyone who wants to know how big Rumsfeld's challenge is in trying to transform the Pentagon must read this book.<br />Johnson was a career soldier before going to RAND.  He has a deep sense of how military cultures operate.  His portrait of the cavalry wing rejecting modernity is humorous and tragic simultaneously.  It is a case study in how large bureaucracies protect themselves and their caste system from being threatened by new developments.<br />Equally, if not more fascinating, is his conclusion that the Air Corps was equally one sided in favoring its theory of big bombers.  While the cavalry drove out officers who believed the time of the horse was past, the Air Corps drove out officers who believed fighter planes were powerful opponents for bombers.  In some ways the Air Corps self-blindness was as dangerous as the cavalry's total identification with an obsolete past.  The refusal to recognize the vulnerability of the bomber meant that bomber crews in Europe would have the greatest risk of dying of any elements of the American military.<br />Johnson also reports on the tankers fixation with lighter, less powerful \\"fast tanks\\" rather than the heavier, more powerfully armed versions the Germans settled on.  The American fixation was on a fast tank that could break through and run amok behind enemy lines but was incapable of standing up to German tanks in one on one fights.  The result was a tank that led to many more American casualties than necessary.  Interestingly, all post World War II American tank designs have been based on the German model of heavy armor and heavy guns.<br />This is a very thoughtful book filled with quotes from sincere, serious professional military men who were dead wrong but determined to protect their views and to use their position in the hierarchy to get the job done.<br />It is a sobering story for anyone who would modernize a large, complex military bureaucracy.done.<br />It is a sobering story for anyone who would modernize a large, complex military bureaucracy.	2002-05-09

They are faster, more self-indulgent, involve more chaotic characters than Robert Parker, but I nonetheless find myself liking virtually everything Stuart Woods writes.<br />In this case Stone Barrington is asked to go to London for a client to convince the client's niece to leave a drug smuggler and return to America.  Stone is also asked to try to get the boy friend thrown in jail.<br />Once he gets to Britain he discovers the client does not have a niece, the young man is not a drug smuggler, the client is not rich but rather works for American intelligence, and the focus is not the girl but the young man who is trying to make a lot of money moving some very dangerous weapons into the middle east for a profit.<br />All this occurs as Stone moves from old girlfriend to new girlfriend back to old girlfriend meanwhile inspectors of Scotland Yard grow tired of bodies mysteriously showing up near him.<br />It is a fun tale that will keep you going and it ends in a way that ensures more adventures are to come.  I look forward to them.	2002-05-02

The public story has always been that Hess was insane and the allies kept him locked up in Spandau Prison in Berlin until he died in 1987.  However, Iles notes that the entire Hess mission has been wrapped in the deepest secrecy by the British and that keeping open an entire prison for one man suggests something was going on of present value and not merely historic in nature.<br />Iles proposes a few simple daring concepts:  First, there was a faction of the British upper class including the Duke of Windsor who saw Hitler as less dangerous than Stalin and wanted a peace settlement (this is certainly true and both Churchill and Roosevelt knew how totally unreliable the Duke of Windsor was).  He simply suggests that the scale of potential betrayal was so great that it was worth a great deal to the British to keep the involvement of Britons in the Hess mission concealed.<br />Next, Iles suggests that the real Hess had a double and it is the double who ended up spending his life in Spandau while Hess survived first in Latin America and then in South Africa.<br />Finally, Iles intimates that the real Hess used Nazi wealth and contacts to create a substantial fortune dedicated to revenge against Israel and a reassertion of Aryan supremacy using nuclear weapons.<br />The plot is complex and incredibly very fast paced.  The handful of people trying to stop the phoenix-like rise of a new threat is believable and their predicaments remain human and urgent.<br />All in all this is an interesting tale that raises a lot of questions about one of the few world war two secrets which is still buried behind officially closed files.	2002-04-25

Unfortunately for him, MacArthur's long time intelligence chief, General Willoughby, had assured MacArthur there would be no attack.  Rather than be embarrassed Willoughby destroys the report and drives the young Marine Captain into early retirement.<br />However, Willoughby's plan is blocked by two developments.  First, North Korea attacks South Korea on June 25 and no Marines are being retired.  Second, our Captain's friend and sponsor, General Pickering intervenes and carries the story to President Truman.<br />American lack of preparedness at the beginning of the Korean War is one of the bitter lessons every preparedness advocate (and I am one) points to in arguing for a strong peacetime America.  Our Army was untrained, unequipped, and undermanned.  The Marines were drastically undermanned.  Our equipment was inferior to the North Korean Russian-supplied equipment.  Our restrictions on the South Koreans did not stop the war (as every liberal hoped it would) they simply made it more tempting for North Korea to attack..<br />This book maintains a wonderful balance between MacArthur as an egocentric isolated and eccentric personality on the one hand and a military genius of the first order on the other.  The consistent rejection of his daring Inchon landing by every traditional senior officer is a good reminder as we look toward Iraq and elsewhere that when in doubt bureaucracies are boring, unimaginative and take the enormous risk of taking no risks at all..<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the art of decision-making at very senior levels and the nature of war when you let your country go unprepared.

If you are interested in the process of transformation or the development of technological change then this book should be on your short list.  It should be required reading at every senior military school and for anyone who is really interested in transforming the health system.<br />This slender volume is actually a series of lectures given between 1950 and 1966 at Cal Tech and was influenced by a 15 year process of dialogue in a regular monthly meeting on the subject of technology and society.  It reflects the insights and wisdom of a lifetime of thought about people and technology.<br />For those who care about transforming military institutions the chapters on Lieutenant Sims' reform of naval gunnery in 1900 and on the building of the best steam warship in the world in 1868 are marvels of bureaucracy confronting technology.<br />Consider just a few insights from Morison:<br />\\"It is possible, if one sets aside the long-run social benefits, to look upon invention as a hostile act--a dislocation of existing schemes, a way of disturbing the comfortable bourgeois routines and calculations, a means of discharging the restlessness with arrangements and standards that arbitrarily limit.\\"  (p.9)<br />When Sims reports remarkable success with a new system of gunnery he has learned from an innovative British officer ((Percy Scott) there are three stages of response from Washington:<br />\\"At first there was no response.  The reports were simply filed away and forgotten.  Some indeed, it was later discovered to Sims's delight, were half eaten away by cockroaches,<br />  \\"Second stage; It is never pleasant for any man's best work to be left unnoticed by superiors and it was an unpleasantness that Sims suffered extremely ill.<br />  \\"Besides altering his tone, he took another step to be sure his views would receive attention, He sent copies of his reports to other officers in the fleet.  Aware as a result that Sims's gunnery claims were being circulated and talked about, the men in Washington were then stirred to action.  \\"p29<br />The response was first that our ships were as good as the British so the problem was with the men and that meant the officers were not doing their job.  \\"most significant: continuous-aim fire was impossible.  Experiments had revealed that five men at work on the elevating gear of a six-inch gun could not produce the power necessary to compensate for a roll of five degrees in ten seconds.  These experiments and calculations demonstrated beyond peradventure or doubts that Scott's system of gunfire was not possible.\\"  p. 30, note this is about a system that was actually being used with amazingly more accurate results.  Sims' reform was not a theory it was an existing fact, which the Navy simply denied.<br />As Morison notes \\"Only one difficulty is discoverable in these arguments: they were wrong at important points.\\"<br />\\"In every way I find this second stage, the apparent resort to reason, the most entertaining and instructive in our investigation of the responses to innovation.\\"  p. 30<br />\\"Third stage: the rational period in the counterpoint between Sims and the Washington men was soon passed.  It was followed by the third stage, that of name calling.\\"  p.30<br />As things got worse Simms took the ultimate risk \\"he, a lieutenant, took the extraordinary step of writing the President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, to inform him of the remarkable record of Scoot's ships, of the inadequacy of our own gunnery routines and records, and of the refusal of the Navy Department to act.  Roosevelt, who always liked to respond to such appeals when he could, brought Sims back from China late in 1902 and installed him as Inspector of Target Practice, a post the naval officer held throughout the remaining six years of the Administration.  And when he left, after many spirited encounters we cannot here investigate, he was universally acclaimed as 'the man who taught us how to shoot.\\"  p.31<br />Morison concludes \\"the deadlock between those who sought change and those who sought to retain things as they were was broken only by an appeal to superior force, a force removed from and unidentified with the mores, conventions, devices of the society.  This seems to me a very important point; the naval society in 1900 broke down in its effort to accommodate itself to a new situation.  The appeal to Roosevelt is documentation for Mahan's great generalisation that no military service should or can undertake to reform itself.  It must seek assistance from outside. \\" p.38<br />Whatever field of change interests you this is a book well worth reading and thinking about.And when he left, after many spirited encounters we cannot here investigate, he was universally acclaimed as 'the man who taught us how to shoot.\\"   p.31<br />Morison concludes \\"the deadlock between those who sought change and those who sought to retain things as they were was broken only by an appeal to superior force, a force removed from and unidentified with the mores, conventions, devices of the society.

This is a superb first novel about a military coup in Saudi Arabia, a French oil company run by a megalomaniac woman determined to use the coup to seize control of Saudi oil away from the Americans and then use it to raise the price of oil and therefore her company's profits, an American CIA agent on the run and hiding in an Israeli Kibbutz and the efforts of Mossad and the American agent to sort everything out.<br />The novel starts with the very persuasive premise that the American rejection of the threat to the Shah was a major factor in his being replaced by Khomeini.  Topol asserts that Jimmy Carter's Washington analysts grossly underestimated how radical and how anti-American Khomeini was and therefore were far too willing to have the Shah fall.  Topol's bias is clearly that modernizing military are far preferable to reactionary religious dictatorship as a solution to a corrupt and decaying regime.<br />Topol then paints a very depressing (and largely accurate) portrait of a corrupt Saudi monarchy which maintains power through repression and which is not dramatically better than the Taliban in its treatment of women in public rights and legal rights.  No one who has been excusing the Saudis' behavior toward their own population and toward the United States and Israel will feel comfortable with this section of the book.<br />Topol postulates that the Saudi system hangs between a reactionary terrorist faction that is growing in strength as the public despairs of declining standards of living and rising repression and a military coup by American trained Saudis who are modernizers and democratizers and who loath both the current system of corruption and the reactionary religious terrorists.<br />This is both an enjoyable book and a useful book in suggesting new thoughts about a country that is important but may be on the edge of substantial change.<br />Watching a Saudi cleric smile and laugh as bin Laden reported gleefully on the killing of Americans and listening to that Saudi cleric reassure bin Laden that there were many supporters of anti-American terrorism in Saudi Arabia (\\"my mother's phone kept ringing all day with congratulations\\" was a direct quote from the Saudi visitor) is a useful prelude for reading this novel and thinking about its implications.g to that Saudi cleric reassure bin Laden that there were many supporters of anti-American terrorism in Saudi Arabia (\\"my mother's phone kept ringing all day with congratulations\\" was a direct quote from the Saudi visitor) is a useful prelude for reading this novel and thinking about its implications.	2002-04-05

His father is a revered local doctor who was once sued for malpractice many years ago by the most powerful politician-judge in town.  The son soon finds himself pulled into a 30 year-old murder of a young black worker and begins to realize that a seemingly killing from long ago has current meaning for the town, the power structure, and his own family.<br />Those who participated in that killing still have a very big stake in having the case remain unsolved.  They are prepared to kill to keep yesterday's secrets protected.  The very pressures to give up the case spur the novelist-prosecutor on.  At the same time, he is encouraged by the desperation of the dead man's widow and mother and the hopes of the black community that someone will care about justice.<br />The story is made more complex by a mayor's race in which the black candidate wants the case hushed up until after the election so it will not polarize the community and hurt his chances for election.  The business community wants it hushed up because they are about to close a deal for the opening of a German factory that will create jobs and wealth for Natchez.  The local newspaper is part of a chain and the owner's daughter has been sent to town to learn the trade so she can someday replace her father.  She sees Pulitzer prize written all over the case and so she has a real interest in covering the case with as much sensationalism as possible even if it makes her advertisers mad.  Finally, the FBI has some dirty linen tied up in the failure to solve the case a generation ago and does not want to be embarrassed since the new director of the FBI was the junior agent in the original case.<br />The pressures build, the unexpected develops, and personal life intertwines with history in a fascinating mixture of how life sometimes happens.	2002-03-21

The contract is for over six billion dollars.  The German government faced with rising unemployment was eager to keep the contract secret and in order to keep the money flowing.<br />A German spy of Iranian origin undercover at the facility is killed.  It becomes necessary to find a police detective who will investigate the murder without risking the jobs or exposing other potential negative complications that could affect Germany itself.<br />The novel is well told, will keep you wondering about the next event and the next complication.  It is also a salutary reminder that Saddam Hussein is real, does want nuclear weapons, and is actively trying to buy them and build them.  I personally interviewed the defector who had been the head of the Iraqi nuclear weapons program and who had 7,000 Iraqis working for him when he defected in 1994.  Recently the New York Times reported that a new defector had personally visited 20 sites in Iraq last year in which chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons of mass destruction were being worked on.<br />This novel should remind us that a very vicious dictatorship with a habit of torturing and killing its own people is eager to get the kind of weapons that could blackmail us or cause us enormous losses of life.  It is well worth reading.	2002-03-13

A retired FBI agent with a heart transplant is recruited by the woman whose sister's heart he now owns into investigating why his donor was killed.  The story illustrates a tension between the professional law enforcement community and outsiders, the tension between local and federal law enforcement, and the complexity of a crime that starts out in one direction and moves in several other directions.  The more you read the more you will keep reading to find out how it is solved.<br />The characters and their dilemmas are quite realistic.  You will find yourself rooting for the retired agent and his new friend against both law enforcement and the criminal.  The southern California scene falls into place and the process of hunting down bad people becomes totally engrossing.  Blood Work is a solid book for losing yourself in a first-rate mystery.	2002-03-08

What kind of book is so subversive and so threatening that it is worth publicly burning and banning?<br />Wei Hui is a young woman who had already authored four books before writing what may be an autobiographical tale of loneliness, confusion, and searching.  If an American woman had authored this book with it's descriptions of wild parties, music, and the restaurant scene with many young people energetically seeking excitement, it would be interesting but not surprising.  What makes this book so fascinating is not only that the Chinese dictatorship finds it threatening at a moral/ideological level but also that the world it portrays is clearly incompatible with a totalitarian regime.<br />If there is even one tenth as much artistic and personal freedom among the young in Beijing and Shanghai as this book portrays and if the freedom to travel within the country is as great as this book outlines (at one point our narrator decides at midday to leave Shanghai and fly to Beijing for a party that night and does so with no difficulties) then China has already decentralized and loosened the power of the secret police to a degree unthinkable in the Soviet Union at any point before its final three years.<br />The personal goals and anxieties of young people in this book are clearly compatible with the modern west.  The degree of interaction with foreigners is astounding and represents a breakdown of both censorship and control in ways that will reassure those who worry about China slipping back into totalitarianism.<br />Finally, her comments about women and life and her repudiation of some aspects of feminism will cause conflicting emotions for those who would like to identify her as a feminist heroine.  She acts outside traditional patterns yet with a remarkably traditional sense of what moves women.y traditional sense of what moves women.	2002-02-27

Kaplan is a talented reporter with a keen understanding of the depth of violence and chaos in much of the world (see his The Coming Anarchy). He has been in key parts of the turbulent third world and he understands the objective realities of millions of rootless young men with desperate futures. He describes vividly the path to a deep reversion to ethnic and religious fanaticism offered as a way of life that to many young men is more fulfilling than a life of poverty without a cause.<br />Kaplan argues correctly that the modern world is much like the ancient world. Humans are human and the problem of violence in and against society is as eternal as Cain and Abel. He skillfully carries us from Churchill's The River War (a study of the British role in the Sudan 1881-1898) a book Kaplan first bought in Khartoum in the mid-1980s. Kaplan understands that the roots of historic conflict run much deeper than today's story and he combines Churchill's personal sense of history with Churchill's role in history.<br />Kaplan carries us through the lessons of Thucydides, Sun T'zu, Livy, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Kant and a series of other scholars who have tried to cope with the challenge of violence and human society. He offers intelligent insights into America's role in the world, the inevitable nature of third world violence in the next half-century and the challenge of creating effective responses and sustainable strategies and institutions.<br />I highly recommend Kaplan's new book to anyone who is trying to understand what needs to be done to response to September 11. There are a number of references in this book to asymmetric power, fanaticism and the intelligent use of unsuspected force outside the rules of modern state warfare, which are prescient of what we are now living through.	2002-02-24

Search the web for the \\"Amber Room of Peter the Great\\" and you will discover an historic set of facts begging to be turned into a novel.  Peter the Great created a magnificent room of Amber.  It was priceless.  The Nazis stole it and it completely disappeared.<br />Jonathan Harris weaves all the historic facts, believable and interesting personalities, and a sound rapid plot into a story that will capture your interest.  A pro-democracy Russian vice President is trailing in the Presidential election against an authoritarian personality running as a communist.  A sudden patriotic coup like returning the fabulous treasure of the Amber Room to the Motherland might be just the event that would give the pro-democracy candidate the emotional edge for the last week of the campaign.<br />The Americans want to help the pro-democracy candidate and one small piece of the Amber Room has come on the market.  A secret agency is assigned the job of tracking down the room and getting it back to Russia before the election.  Others either have or want the room and the race is on.<br />This simple outline does not do justice to the personalities involved, their involvement with each other, and the growth in complexity, interest, and believability as the plot unfolds.  This is a very fine first novel and I look forward to Jonathan Harris' future works.	2002-02-21

All those who said we could never have imagined commercial airliners hitting large buildings had simply not been reading enough adventure fiction.  Tom Clancy had a Boeing 747 hit the Capitol in one of his novels.  Similarly, if at some future time we discover that someone really vicious has acquired a very advanced weapon system by bribing a disgruntled military member of a decaying system, we should not be surprised if we read Kilo Option.  Flannery assumes that a group has bribed a small crew who were supposed to scuttle a Russian submarine to fake the scuttling and instead sail the submarine to a rendezvous and sell it to some people with really dreadful ideas about how to use it.<br />Considering the number of countries in which salaries are low and often months or even years behind in payment.  Imagine the people who watch corrupt regimes and lose any faith in their leaders standing for anything.  Imagine the steady proliferation of advanced systems across the planet.  Then remember that the very sophisticated very expensive submarine monitoring system we built to track Soviet submarines during the cold war is now gradually disappearing as we focus on more immediate problems.  The result could easily be an intelligence gap into which some really unthinkable things could happen.<br />Kilo Option outlines one plausible scenario and how it is ultimately stopped by a very narrow margin.  It is worth reading and pondering.	2002-01-23

Kissinger understands that foreign policy has to be rooted in reality and must be consistently maintained if it is to be effective.  He is alert to the pressures which have been weakening the Atlantic Alliance, the need to accommodate European legitimate interests, the importance of Japan to America's future and the unique blend of idealism and realism which makes American foreign policy so complicated and makes our country so difficult for others to understand.<br />This is one of Kissinger's best books.  It is clear, written for the informed citizen who is not a specialist in foreign policy, and covers virtually every major issue facing America.  This is a book the Bush Administration can use for sophisticated planning and the interested citizen can use to better understand the context in which the daily news is made.	2002-01-18

His Stone Barrington character is one I will routinely buy as soon as it hits the shelf.  Like Robert Parker he has decided he needs a female character and in Orchid Beach he created a retired military policewoman turned small Florida town police chief Holly Barker.<br />She is a much more reasonable, much more middle-class person than Stone and the rhythm of the two novels which feature her are tighter, more directed and less personality dominated than the Barrington novels.<br />In this case, there is a tragic killing of her fianc&eacute; on the morning of their wedding day.  A simple brutal murder in a bank robbery turns into a much bigger case as anti-government extremists become the center of the plot and the FBI are called in.<br />Holly's father, a retired Army sergeant becomes the bait for the bad guys and infiltrates their operation.

Therefore, it will come as no surprise that I bought this new book as soon as it was in the bookstore or that I am recommending it.<br />It is interesting that Parker has now written enough different novels about his male private eye, Spenser (28 books), his female private eye, Randall, (2 novels) and his small town police chief, Stone (3 novels) that he has parallel series running simultaniously.  In addition he has written a diverse series of other novels.<br />In this episode Jesse Stone is wrestling with a broken marriage, a drinking problem, a number of other women who are interested in him, and a vicious killing.<br />As in all Parker novels you get his version of how life really works, a pretty good mystery story, a fascinating soap opera in which you sense more hope than pain and a continuing belief in the power of endurance to help people get through life.<br />Having read almost all of Parker's work I cannot tell how much of his core philosophy is autobiographical and reflects his own life, how much is an idealized version of what he believes to be true, and how much is what he believes his readers will pay to buy a book and read.  In any event he keeps me hooked and I will come back for the next Parker novel on any topic and with any central character he wants to write about.	2002-01-03

Pitt has all the sophisticated tests, physical abilities, raw courage and looks and charm, which is required for a heroic figure.  What keeps him from becoming a caricature is the fascinating vision of life at sea and the complexities of the ocean gives to any activity.<br />Cussler clearly can spin a good story and in this case he unveils a Nazi project to launch the fourth Reich (It is fascinating that there are far more novels about totally improbable Nazi revenge than there are about tragically real Islamic medieval terrorism and there are far more novels about bad Germans 56 years after the Second World War than there are about all too real current acts of terror against Israel and the West or for that matter the terrorists who seek to destabilize India, the Philippines, Indonesia, etc.).<br />Cussler brings to life the threat to the modern world and in an adventure, which is in many ways closer to science fiction than to traditional adventure fiction.  He creates a threat to humans everywhere and a Nazi plan to inundate the world with massive oceanic and climate changes and then provide very large Noah's arks which they will control so they will be the only effective survivors (anyone else who manages to survive they plan to wipe out during the aftermath).<br />While the story is wildly implausible Cussler builds it step by step so that you find yourself both fascinated by how it will turn out and totally rooting for the good guys led by Pitt to win.	2001-12-26

Hanson's argument about culture and warfare should be read with Hernando de Soto's The Mystery of Capitalism that argues that prosperity is also a function of culture and legality.  The two books on very different topics actually make the same point and create a new analytical framework for understanding why some countries develop and become prosperous and powerful and others do not.<br />Hanson makes the case that western military capabilities (currently on display in Afghanistan) are a function of culture going back to the rise of the Greek city-states.  He asserts that the combination of a polity in which the warriors vote on going to war in which they will serve (in effect the property owning voters were the heart of the Greek Phalanx so they were voting to put themselves at risk).  They needed to have a short campaign between the planting and harvest seasons since the warrior-farmers had to both sustain the economy and the battle creating a style of war which involved short direct shock actions (the Greek phalanx so brilliantly portrayed in Pressfield's the Gates of Fire).  This reliance on infantry combat by disciplined units in direct shock assault was compounded by the economics of Greek geography.  Faced with the reality that in small valleys surrounded by mountains you could produce ten infantrymen for every cavalrymen because horses are far more expensive than humans, the Greeks really emphasized the development of high technology (long spear, short stabbing sword, big shield, very tough helmet) infantry combat with extremely disciplined teams.<br />Finally, Hanson asserts that the rule of law in the Greek city-state guaranteed every soldier a status and legal rights and protection which created a sense of stability and commitment unlike any non-western culture.  It is the combination of voting and legality, which Hanson believes, combined to create such a powerful system of war.<br />Hanson argues that this style of war led to two major breakthroughs that have persisted in the west to this day.<br />First, the kind of courage required by a phalanx is a disciplined refusal to break.  It is the opposite of the heroic courage of traditional warrior societies.  In traditional warrior societies (including the Greeks of Homer's Iliad assaulting the Trojans with individual heroism in a pre-phalanx era) the warrior rushes forward individually to count coup (the native American model) or seize prisoners (the Aztec model) or simply kill enemies (the Gauls and Germans against the Romans).  In the Greek phalanx and the Roman legion which grew from it the primary courage is the discipline of standing fast with your fellow soldiers and refusing to break even when overwhelmingly outnumbered (thus the British at Rorke's Drift when outnumber 35 to one never thought of breaking ranks and the American soldiers in Mogadishu never dreamed of an every man for themselves approach even when outnumbered by more than 100 to one).<br />Second, the direct action model of warfare creates a ruthlessness, a directness, and a constant search for the decisive battle, which Hanson argues, is peculiarly western.  Thus in the second world war Marshall argued for the direct frontal assault on German occupied Europe as the correct search for the decisive battle.<br />Hanson asserts that other cultures emphasize deception, maneuver, indirect conflict, setting up symbolic fights but the western model is an overwhelming direct assault aimed at achieving decisive victory as quickly as possible and assuming that short term violence actually saves lives in the long run.<br />Hanson reasons that three other patterns have made the west increasingly dominant in warfare.  First, the Greek rational approach to scientific reasoning that emphasized facts and a constant search for better answers.  Second, the use of free markets and commercial activity to create production systems has simply out-produced and out-modernized competitors.  Hanson notes that there are virtually no cases of westerners importing non-western military technology but endless examples of non-westerners importing western technology.  Third, the pragmatic approach to problem solving from the Greek and Roman tradition means that when western militaries encounter new realities (the Aztecs, the military systems of the Japanese Navy, the Ottoman Navy) there was a speed of analysis and flexible experimentation that non-westerners could not match.<br />Hanson uses the battles of Salamis 480 B.C. (the Greeks defeat the Persians in a naval battle), Gaugemala 331 B.C. (Alexander's Greeks destroy the Persian Empire), Cannae 216 B.C. (the Romans are annihilated and respond by raising new armies to destroy Carthage), Poitiers 732 A.D. (French landed infantry defeats Muslim cavalry), Tenochtitlan 1520-1521 (a remarkably small number of Spanish conquer Mexico and destroy the Aztec empire), Lepanto 1571 (the Christian fleets destroy the Ottoman Navy and establish western naval supremacy in the Mediterranean), Rorke's Drift 1879 (a remarkably outnumbered British force defeats a Zulu Army), Midway 1942 ( in one improbable day the Americans destroy Japanese Carrier aviation and seize the initiative in the Pacific War), and Tet 1968 (despite stunningly false press coverage the American military decisively defeats the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese by developing better tactics and superior technology) in a magisterial sweep of military history to make his case.<br />This is a book any sophisticated student of war or any citizen concerned about the role of warfare in national survival would want to read.-modernized competitors.

It begins with the assertion&quot; Exactly fifty women were sent into France as secret agents by the Special Operations Executive during the Second World War.  Of those, thirty-six survived the war.  The other fourteen gave their lives.  This book is dedicated to all of them.&quot;<br />b<br />Follett starts with those facts and then builds a story around the best of the women agents being assigned the job of blowing up the most important telephone exchange connecting the German military between France and Germany and doing it during the week preceding the invasion at Normandy.  Follett communicates the sense that destroying this exchange will make the German response to invasion much slower and thus save lives and increase the chance that the greatest risk of the Second World War, the Normandy invasion, would succeed.  He then creates a German intelligence officer who is determined to roll up the resistance before the invasion can occur.<br />The contest between allies and Nazis builds to a level of tension that is palpable.  The risks people took to defeat Nazi Germany and secure safety were stunning.  The notion of people dropping into France again and again on secret missions with their lives at risk every minute comes through in this book with a force that grips the reader.  The sense of Nazi brutality and ruthlessness is captured in a very realistic sense of what Nazi occupied France was like.<br />Anyone who doubts that evil can exist and that decent people have to risk everything to defeat evil will have their doubts erased by this novel.  Follett has done it again.	2001-12-13

His power of language and imagination are amazing.  Every one of his novels is amazing (I have read 5 of the 6 he has written and I am reading the sixth now.).  Each novel has a totally different premise with totally different characters.  There is a bias toward the southern but the novels are worldwide in scope.  This one begins in Hong Kong and goes to New York before ending up in New Orleans with a side trip to the Cayman Islands.<br />Iles has a wonderful sense of life, mystery and history and how they blend together to form one tapestry.  He also has a wonderful gift to construct words that will keep you engrossed for the entire book.<br />In Dead Sleep a professional combat photographer sees pictures of dead women in an art exhibition in Hong Kong including a portrait of her twin sister who had been killed in New Orleans.  She is compelled to track down the artist and ends up ensnared in a pattern of serial killing with macabre overtones (like Robert Parker and Stuart Woods, Iles now has a female protagonist).  She inevitably ends up working with the FBI in a very strained relationship (it says something about the Bureau or about modern literary convention that you can only work with the FBI in a strained relationship).<br />I cannot recommend Iles books to highly and this certainly maintains the standard.	2001-12-06

Once again, Flannery develops a novel that is both convincing and compelling.<br />Imagine that Stalin had been convinced that it was vital that the atomic bomb project should be stopped or at a minimum that the United States believe the atomic bomb would not work and that they had recalled their best spy from Germany and refocused him to go to America and try to penetrate the Manhattan Project.  Imagine further that he was given cover through a young Russian woman who was recruited to act as his wife for the duration.  Then consider the possibility that a really good spy would work very hard to penetrate the project and to kill General Grove and science director Oppenheimer.<br />As a precaution, the spies were infiltrated from a captured German submarine and the hope was that if anything would be discovered it would be blamed on the Germans.  Groves, a very methodical man, sought to protect the project from this kind of security threat and brought in someone he did not quite trust but knew had a compulsion to hunt down every threat.<br />Flannery takes this skeletal structure and turns it into a very believable tale of patriotism, and heroism on both sides.  Ultimately he leaves you to contemplate the tragedies of lives broken by the demands of a global war and the beginning of a cold war.	2001-11-28

This is also a tour de force by a senior historian who brought a lifetime of study to bear on the middle ages and now uses the plague as a literary device to teach us a lot about the medieval world and how it has shaped our own.<br />The powerful role of law suits and the constant presence of lawyers and lawsuits is one of the real surprises to those of us who thought the plague of lawyers was a modern problem.  The upper class in the middle ages spent an enormous amount of energy contracting, suing and maneuvering in the legal system.  Family fortunes came and went depending on the cleverness of their legal strategies and the quality of their legal warriors.  Women often had far more powerful positions than we might have expected because they often had legal rights to income and land which made them central to the future of several families contesting for survival.<br />Just prior to the plague there had been a period of good weather (yes warming and cooling, drought and floods were climactic concerns in the middle ages fully as much as in the modern era).  The resulting population explosion had driven down the price of labor and led to substantial malnutrition while pushing people out to cultivate less and less fertile land.<br />The plague reversed those trends.  The great die offs (up to forty percent in some towns) created a labor shortage and shifted the balance of power as some wealthy families were wiped out and others were crippled.  The legal efforts to cope with change on this scale laid the basis for modern Anglo-Saxon property law.<br />Cantor argues that the plague was almost certainly not just bubonic plague.  He argues that it spread far too rapidly to have been carried by rats and to places that urban rats would not have reached in that short a time.  Furthermore he argues the death rate was far too great for bubonic plague alone.<br />Cantor points out that there was probably a second cause of death in an anthrax epidemic among cattle, which were then eaten by people.

The one is hard, alienated, and driven, the other is soft, complex and uncertain.  Yet, in the end the British Professor's determination to save his wife is an even more effective force than the German spy's desire to fulfil her mission.<br />The intricacies of both the American scene from Princeton to Los Alamos and the building of the bomb and the deprivation and determination of wartime Britain using German spies to send false messages back to Germany are both compelling.<br />Altman fits these pieces of the puzzle into a believable and fascinating story which will keep you going.  If you like spies, complexity, and fast paced adventure you will read this novel and look forward to Altman's next book as I do.	2001-11-07

Let me be clear. While Andrei Cherny is a liberal, he has written one of the most thoughtful books about public policy in the information age to be produced by anyone of any ideological background or from any partisan belief. Cherny does a stunning job of placing the progressive movement in the context of the rise of the industrial corporation and makes a profound case that the rise of information technology that moves from mass production to intense personalization and choice that will profoundly change the relationship between government and citizens.<br />At one level these are not new ideas. Alvin and Heidi Toffler explained the general principles in 1979 in The Third wave. What makes Cherny's contribution so impressive is the degree to which he embeds the technological changes of today in the parallel ideas and experiences of 100 years ago. Just as the rise of the industrial corporation created the systems and the structures that could be translated into professional bureaucracy and into systems such as the city manager form of government, so the development of the automatic teller machine, the self serve gas station, the internet based personal reservation system for airlines and the personally directed 401k all spell the rise of a personally directed citizen process that will transform the process of governance.<br />I disagree deeply with some of Cherny's ideas, but I am in awe of his ability to take big concepts and embed them in American political history in a manner which will give them context and meaning for any citizen who wishes to study them.<br />I unequivocally recommend this book to any citizen who wants to know how we can improve our country.	2001-11-01

Parker has spent virtually his entire career writing mysteries about Boston and New England.  In one break, years ago, he wrote Love and Glory, a heart wrenching novel about love, alcoholism, pain and endurance and one of the most moving novels I have ever read.  Now he has moved in a totally different direction.<br />Gunman's Rhapsody is a western and a love story.  The love story is a little stilted but still powerful.  The western is about one of the genuine historic moments in American history, Wyatt Earp and the Gunfight at the OK Corral.<br />This is a practical no nonsense purposeful Earp who cautiously but determinedly gets his own way.  It argues in essence that Wyatt fell for a woman who was living with Sheriff Behan and in stealing her he created a bitter enemy and the rest was history.<br />The tale is well told, interesting both as a look at the Earp Brothers and Doc Holliday and interesting as an imagining of what motivates men to kill and die in situations that on the surface seem irrational but under the surface go to the core of being human.<br />This is a different Robert Parker but he is still well worth reading.	2001-10-18

Assume the Chinese encourage their Pakistani friends to stir up trouble on India's western border.  Assume the Pakistani military produces a risk-taking leader who replaces the weak government, undertaking a high-risk campaign against India with strong backing from China.  Assume that at the peak of the Pakistani campaign, the Chinese launch an attack on India.  These circumstances set the stage for what follows.  As India's larger military weight wears out the Pakistanis and India pushes into Pakistan, the Pakistanis desperately decide to use nuclear weapons tactically on their own territory.  From then on, the situation spirals out of control.<br />The recent terrorist attacks on America make this novel slightly less likely because we are almost certainly going to see a stronger American military and a closer American relationship with Pakistan, which will have a stabilizing influence.<br />Nonetheless, as a harbinger of the dangers the world will face in the next generation and the potential for utilization of weapons of mass destruction, this is an especially believable and incredibly thought-provoking novel well worth reading.	2001-10-14

It recounts the extraordinary epic of ten thousand Greek mercenaries abandoned around eastern Iraq who fought and marched across modern Turkey against overwhelming odds and returned to Greece by way of the Black Sea.<br />This novel is a sound first novel, openly based on Xenophon's work, and a good introduction to the challenges faced by Xenophon both in the failing Greece in which Athens had been defeated by the Peloponnesian Wars and the economy and society were both battered and in the long ordeal of first service and then a march of extraordinary endurance.<br />For anyone interested in thinking about the ancient world, the degree to which cultures have clashed, and the process of survival this is a thought-provoking book.	2001-10-04

Roy Chapman Andrews was the real thing-a genuine explorer-adventurer who expanded the horizons of science and captured the public imagination.  His complexity can be found in his ability to live in a palace in Beijing surrounded by servants, gourmet food, and polo ponies, and then wander off into the Gobi for five months (carrying of course a gourmet cook, white tablecloths, and enough rifles to fend off bandits).<br />I love the American Museum of Natural History, and I grew up on stories of Chapman's great expeditions, the discovery of dinosaur eggs, and a host of other romantic-scientific tales (Beebe in the South Pacific looking for birds, Akeley in Africa, the list goes on).  This book covers an amazing range of realities.<br />Gallenkamp addresses an array of subjects, including the intricacies of Chinese and Mongolian politics in the 1920s and 1930s, the consequences of the breakdown of society in the form of rising banditry and rising corruption, the emerging anti-western sentiment as scientists became robbers of the nation's heritage, the drama of scientific research, the evolving history of evolution, and the intricacies of running a museum.  He also accurately depicts the nature of celebrity status in a peacetime western world seeking glamour through adventure (this being the age of Byrd flying to the North Pole, Lindberg flying the Atlantic, etc).<br />This book interestingly notes how science evolves and one generation's knowledge becomes another generation's discarded inaccuracies.  Andrews went to central Asia searching for the origins of man.  We now know those origins lie in Africa.  Andrews found a carnivorous dinosaur lying on some eggs that they thought belonged to a horned dinosaur and assumed it was eating them (thus, the dinosaur's name became \\"egg thief that loves ceratopsians\\").  Now we know that those eggs actually belonged to the Ovirapter and were being mothered, not eaten.  Many of Andrews' best discoveries are still on exhibit at the Museum in New York and well worth seeing.<br />Today, as Michael Novacek notes in his foreword, Mongolia and China are again open to exploration, and science is moving on.  The American Museum has annual expeditions into the Gobi and cooperates widely with Chinese and Mongolian scientists.  Ultimately, Gallenkamp's Dragon Hunter takes a major step in the restoration of Andrews' reputation as a serious contributor to modern science.er and were being mothered, not eaten.

General Clark commanded NATO during its first war, the war to push Serbia out of Kosovo. Clark candidly outlines the political complexities of an alliance, the gap between the view from Washington and the NATO headquarters in Washington, and the impact of the news media on both the military and diplomatic campaigns.<br />As we enter what will almost certainly be a long campaign against terrorism, a campaign that will involve allies, the news media and probably some significant military actions, there is a lot to be learned from Clark's description of the constantly evolving balance between the politicians, the military, the diplomats, and the news media. The anti-terrorist campaign will be longer and more complicated than the NATO intervention in Kosovo and that was so difficult it almost failed.<br />Clark describes a pattern of destructive dishonesty that permeated the Clinton Administration. Clark could never count on candor from Shelton (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs), Secretary of Defense Cohen, or President Clinton. Contrast that with the fact that we have every reason to believe President Bush, Vice President Cheney, Secretaries Powell, and Rumsfeld. This administration will prove far more reliable and far more honorable.<br />However Clark cautions that far beyond the weaknesses of the Clinton Administration there is a new complexity to coalition warfare in a 24-hour news media environment that will require new thinking and new systems to sustain effectiveness and ensure victory.	2001-09-19
US	49697848	R3V0HUUVAXZFQT	1891668080	533146020	Rora	Books	5	46	47	N	N	Stunningly Brilliant	This is a work of such stunning brilliance that it has sent me out to look for the rest of Huggins' writing.  He takes the few known facts about the battle between the Waldenses' and the Inquisition's determination to exterminate them and turns those facts into a novel of remarkable wisdom and insight.  The Waldenses were Protestants marked for extermination by the Inquisition in 1655.  Those Waldenses, unlucky enough to be living in relatively accessible country were massacred (about 6,000).  The last refuge was a mountain valley of enormous difficulty to attack with only three easily defended points of access.  About 150 men fought off 26,000 for weeks and cost the Piedmont Army about 12,000 casualties before being overrun.  Even when their valley was overrun the remaining men hid in the caves of the mountains and continued the war.<br />The extraordinary military leader of this campaign was a mountain man named Joshua Gianavel.  His wife and three daughters were burned at the stake when he refused to surrender (he and they would have been killed anyway if he had surrendered) and when he crossed the Alps to take his young son (the only surviving member of his family) to Geneva for safekeeping another 300 men volunteered to fight at his side.  Ultimately they defeated the Piedmont Army in a campaign of extraordinary brilliance.<br />Huggins captures the essence of leadership.  One follower observes: &quot;In such a situation a man makes a decision by what he has brought to the battle, by what he decided within himself long before the first blow was thrown.  Men do not become heroes in a war; they are heroes before a war.  War is only the place where their heroism is easily seen.&quot;  If you would care to understand how history can be made by stubborn idealism reinforced by courage and applied intelligence this is a book you must read.	2001-09-06

Now in Rise to Rebellion he tells deftly the story of the initial phase of the American Revolution. From the Boston Massacre and John Adams' decision to defend a British officer in court (a key step toward the rule of law which made the American Revolution so different from its French and Russian successors), to Benjamin Franklin's desperate and patient ten year effort to be an Englishman while representing the colonies in London to the quiet emergence of Washington as the disciplined force on which the revolution would succeed, Shaara creates a tour de force.<br />Anyone who would seek to understand the origins of the American Revolution and the precepts of political order, private property, individual liberty and the rule of law which made this the keystone for human freedom will find this a compelling book.Shaara captures with remarkable accuracy the process of how these revolutionaries placed themselves at enormous risk to create a new future. His portrait of how the Continental Congress moves slowly and with great agony toward independence is worth the entire book. His portrait of Franklin gradually becoming first disillusioned then embittered, then angry and finally defiant against the very Britain he had wanted to belong to is worth a dozen books.<br />I cannot recommend this book too strongly if you would like to understand how America came to be. I am looking forward to the promised second volume.	2001-08-30

It is simultaneously a sympathetic view of Osama bin Laden and the United States intelligence and antiterrorist efforts.  In Kirk McGarvey, the deputy director for operations Hagberg has created a believable hero with a believable family and very human frailties.  This book is a cross between Tom Clancy and Ian Fleming.  Assume that bin Laden acquires a tactical nuclear weapon that is easy to hide (they do exist, both we and the Russians have them, some of the Russian depots have been unpaid, and the system could leak.)<br />The plot involves bin Laden sympathizers in Central Asia that may have infiltrated the vulnerable Russian system.  Bin Laden wants to use this threat to achieve an American withdrawal from his homeland of Saudi Arabia.  The United States deciding it can take no chances launches a preemptive strike using Tomahawk cruise missiles to hit bin Laden's camp.  Nevertheless, the action neither kills him nor hurts the nuclear weapon.  Bin Laden then decides to use the weapon in the United States and specifically targets someone close to the President who is in a very public setting along with thousands of other people.  It will get you to think hard about the real dangers of terrorism and the challenge of creating a strong enough system to defeat it.  I am going to look for more novels by Hagberg.	2001-07-25

Then the billionaire puts you up on the yacht anchored at his mansion in Palm Beach and the chef on the yacht is a stunningly attractive woman who gets you to forget the widow you thought you had once been in love with.<br />It is cheerfully put together nonsense but if you like the Stone Barringotn series you will not be able to put this book down.  The portrait of Palm Beach is well done and the intricacies of greed, lust, and revenge blend together into a twisted tale that will keep your attention until the last page.	2001-07-12

Everyone who wants to understand the difference between Bosnia, Kosovo, Rwanda and America should read this book.<br />This is a breathtaking tour of how American weaves a pattern of achievement and opportunity and how various ethnic groups have responded and are responding to it.  The heart of Barone's thesis is that America has successfully integrated and assimilated people of different backgrounds, and that there are patterns to that assimilation that are working for 21st century new Americans just as they worked for the 19th and 20th century American immigrants.  Barone asserts that the modern elite's attitude toward group identity, opposition to middle class society, and assertion of racial grievances actually retards the process of assimilation.  He regards most bilingual education as a political spoils system for bilingual teachers, which actually hurts the very people it is designed to help.  He notes that patterns of intermarriage and upward mobility in income and education are creating assimilative patterns even as university elites seek to divide young Americans by race and teach them to focus on historic grievances rather than future opportunities.<br />It is impossible in a short review to do justice to the brilliance of Barone's writing, the depth of his research, or the clarity of his examples.  His parallels between Irish and African Americans, Italian and Latino immigrants and Jews and Asians are profound and extraordinarily thought provoking.	2001-07-05

This novel is about an American stationed in Antarctica.  There is a discovery of a device, which appears to be a spaceship.  Followed by an effort by the French and the British (but interestingly not the Russians or Chinese) to steal the device using elite military units with a take no prisoners, leave no witnesses model.  Killer whales and a unique species of elephant seal that kills both killer whales and humans complicate the events.  Combine all this with icebergs, stealth aircraft and you have an unending introduction to new ideas and new experiences.<br />The central figures include a heroic Marine force recon lieutenant (whose exploits make James Bond seem trivial), a young girl, and a seal.  This book has a number of factual errors that can be overlooked.  For instance, Marine helicopter carriers have naval Captains not Marines commanding them, and negotiations occur at the State Department not at the Capitol.  Many of the inventive solutions are impossible, but the pace, the inventiveness, and the cleverness keep you turning the pages.  I am looking forward to his next adventure of the mind and spirit and will buy it enthusiastically.	2001-06-28

It is a serious systematic look at military innovation between the first and second world wars and its ten chapters run the gamut from aircraft carriers to submarines to mechanized combined armed warfare (the Blitzkrieg) to the development of radar, the emergence of amphibious landing capability, and the evolution of strategic bombing campaigns.  There is a wide divergence of patterns both between topics and between countries. The British led in aircraft carrier development but made a series of organizational and technological choices that left them far behind the Japanese and the Americans. The British also led in the development of the tank but then rejected it as a mobile warfare system and were rapidly supplanted by the Germans who used the 1920s British tests as a basis for their development of Blitzkrieg. The submarine was rejected politically by everyone but was then developed effectively by the Americans and the Germans. The American torpedo failures are a maddening study in bureaucratic rejection of reality and a sober warning to the current peacetime Pentagon.<br />This book captures the complexity and the lessons of peacetime military innovation as well as any that has been written. It should be required reading for everyone who wants to work on the current problems of transforming the Pentagon.	2001-06-21

It suggests that there could be small groups of Neanderthals still surviving in Central Asia and that they could have characteristics different from ours. It notes that anthropologists have concluded that Neanderthal brains were actually larger rather than smaller than ours. It goes on to speculate that this could have been because they had ways of communicating which were dramatically different than our own and which had both positive and negative side effects in competing with Cro-Magnons (us) when we showed up.<br />The story is well told both as adventure and as scientific mystery and you will find yourself reflecting on cross-cultural relationships, strategies for survival, the nature of scientific investigations and the tragedy of life in new ways.	2001-06-14

During October 1950 in North Korea near the Chosin Reservoirs, twelve Chinese divisions surrounded the U.S. First Marine Division. The Chinese launched a surprise attack aimed at cutting off the First Division and then annihilating it. To the West, the Second Division of the U.S. Army fell apart under pressure from the Chinese. There was every reason to believe the Marines would be surrounded and massacred. They had only one tiny road running through mountains and narrow passes to carry them back to the sea over 70 miles away.<br />The survival of the Marines and their march to the sea is an epic tale of courage, discipline, and the power of esprit de corps in horrible weather against almost overwhelming odds. It was captured brilliantly in Pat Frank's Hold Back the Night a generation ago and now almost poetically in a new novel by a veteran of the campaign.<br />This book is made even more poignant by the post script, \\"I've been asked by several people who read this novel in pre-publication if the fictional Thomas Verrity was inspired by my rifle company commander in the Taebaek Mountains of North Korea, Captain John H. Chaffee of Rhode Island, who would later become Governor of his state, Secretary of the Navy and a United States senator. Yes, he was.\\"<br />There is a deep heart felt sense of truth in this novel and of the anguish of life when a free people have to lose their loved ones in combat because of grotesque failures of leadership. This is a Marine's novel. It is harsh and unrelenting in telling of MacArthur's overconfidence, isolation, and self-deception. It is painful for me as an Army brat to read some of its description of the breakdown of the Army that winter.<br />This book is also a sobering reminder that a weak, unprepared America pays in blood for its politicians' unwillingness to pursue strength as the only sure safeguard of peace and freedom. I highly recommend it.	2001-06-07

This is not quite the work of genius that Black Hawk Down was but this is a very engrossing and serious account of a manhunt that came to symbolize many of the challenges we face in the drug war. Pablo Escobar was the richest and most powerful cocaine dealer in the world. He acquired pretensions to enter politics and turn Colombia into a personal fiefdom. The United States government allied with the Colombian government in what became a multi-year campaign that was far harder and far more dangerous than any one would have believed when it began.<br />In the end Pablo was dead but the drug trade was as powerful and as profitable as ever. Its center of activity had moved from Medellin to Cali and the newer generation of drug lords had learned a lot from watching (and in fact participating in) the campaign against Pablo. In many ways the Cali cartel became the ally of the Colombian and American governments jointly seeking to get rid of Escobar.<br />This book raises serious questions about the nature of American involvement in the third world. When combined with Black Hawk Down you get a realistic pair of assessments of the limitations of American power and the nature of the grim realities we are trying to change in much of the third world.<br />This is a very helpful but sobering book for anyone interested in the drug war, in America's role in the world or in a recent skirmish with fascinating ramifications.	2001-05-30

Deaver communicates a deeper personal sense of Reagan than any other book I have read.  For any student history interested in how this remarkable man could carry the conservative movement to the White House, defeat the Soviet Empire, restart the American economy and rebuild faith in the American civic culture, this book is must reading.  Deaver was with Reagan for thirty years and has thought deeply about his leadership since then.  This book captures that analysis in remarkably few pages.<br />Let me just give you a few of the many insights Deaver outlines: &quot;If we Californians had a modicum of smarts, it was that we understood the secret to Reagan's success.  He won when people saw him and heard his message.  Personal persuasion, not political manipulation, was the secret of Reagan's magic.  To Sears, Ronald Reagan was just another political commodity.  To us, he was something special, someone we knew the American people would embrace if they got to know him,&quot; p.198-99.<br />&quot;It was during his tenure as GE spokesman that he learned it was best always to dine with his listeners.  Later in life Richard Nixon would advise Reagan that he should eat his dinner in solitude in his hotel room where he could rehearse one last time and relish the quiet time before facing the gritty masses.  This would not only provide the opportunity for singular uninterrupted dining, Nixon advised, but would also afford a triumphant entrance into the ballroom.  Reagan respectfully discarded the loner Nixon's counsel, preferring to always take his seat at the head table and dine at the same time as everybody else.  He did this not out of any populist impulses but out of a need to be in the same room as his audience so he could make a personal connection before he spoke.  \\" . . . He was always listening and learning.&quot; p.54.  This is a must read for students of leadership, government, politics and history.r students of leadership, government, politics and history.	2001-05-23

Trilobites are among the best fossils for children to get to know because they are very distinct (the tri lobed shells) and very different from anything currently living (the horseshoe crab on American Atlantic beaches is comparable in unique appearance and attracts children with similar fascination).<br />For those who want a better system of American science education, Fortey gives some powerful hints.  Consider his language: &quot;The fever of discovery was upon me.... I found a trilobite...the textbook came alive...this was my first discovery of the animals that would change my life (p.18).&quot;  He continues, \\"I knew, by some principle which I could not articulate, that the wider end was the head of the animal.  And of course upon the head there were the eyes.  Despite the unfamiliar conformation of the fossil I knew that eyes must always belong on heads.  So despite the exoticism of the fossil there was already a common bond between me and the trilobite - we both had our heads screwed on the right way.&quot;(p.19)<br />Again and again Fortey reminds us that scientists grow from discovery, mystery, romance, intrigue, while the memorization comes later.  He reminds us that there is an enormous amount we still do not know and in the process introduces us to a world we have never considered:  &quot;I want to invest the trilobite with all the glamour of the dinosaur and twice its endurance.  I want you to see the world through the eyes of trilobites, to help you make a journey back through hundreds of millions of years...this will be an unabashedly trilobite-centric view of the world,&quot;(p.19).<br />For anyone who wants to take a few hours to think different thoughts, to consider how brief our history has been and how successful other organisms have been, to contemplate the various catastrophic extinctions and their dramatic impact on life, to ask about life beyond the rush hour traffic and the monthly report, Fortey's work is a little gem of an introduction to a fascinating part of the world.  I highly recommend it.life, to ask about life beyond the rush hour traffic and the monthly report, Fortey's work is a little gem of an introduction to a fascinating part of the world.

In some ways it is as sickening as Hannibal.  In other ways it is so endlessly inventive and contains so many twists and turns that it is a truly gripping story.<br />The plot is direct.  The Germans release a serial killer with the assignment of killing FDR.  The FBI has relegated to a desk job their best tracker of criminals because he is too much of a loner and too violent for the modern FBI.  The race is on, and it is never dull.  Kelleher clearly has an amazing imagination, a good sense for writing very fast action fiction, and a deep understanding of the hideously pathological.  He combines them into a novel which I cannot recommend as pleasant reading (it is simply too gory and contains grotesque behavior by a serial killer who is clearly bizarre) but I can assure the artistry of the writing and the pace of the unexpected twists and turns makes it an absolutely fascinating way to spend some hours away from every day life.	2001-05-09

This is a Spenser novel, and like all good Spenser novels, it is a comforting friend with predictable patterns. Susan will be desirable, distinctive, and busy with her own career, but supportive of Spenser even in his more self-destructive aspects. Honor and stubbornness force Spenser to stick himself in harm's way and see what will happen. Susan prefers the risk of bodily harm with personal integrity to a person of greater caution and less commitment.  Hawk will be available to cover Spenser's back and help break the bad guys.<br />In this novel Parker combines the best of the Magnificent Seven, cleaning up a town. In making Steve McQueen proud, a Mexican American ally of Spenser's says to the bad guys, &quot;We deal in lead, friend\\"(278). With an almost perfect plot for the California detective novels of the thirties and forties, the complexity of characters and plot kept me happily pursuing the story with every page.<br />Having recently read a fair amount of Richard Feynman's efforts to explain quantum physics in lay terms, I beamed approvingly as Spenser opined, &quot;Afterlife is no less implausible than anything else. All explanations of existence are equally incredible.&quot; Faith in God is at least as plausible as faith in physics in explaining the behavior in the universe.<br />If you have already fallen in love with Spenser, Susan, and Hawk you will enjoy this new opportunity to extend the acquaintanceship. If you have never encountered them before this is a lively way to make a new literary friend.	2001-05-02

Ridley does a remarkable job of introducing you to how genes work, what their interactions seem to be, and the relationship between heredity and free choice.  He makes a compelling case that in the end our genetic code contains limits (humans can not fly on their own) and probabilities (how likely we are to get breast cancer or Alzheimer's) but there are so many specific individual choices that no two twins are identical.  If identical twins with identical genetic inheritances interact with their environment and their life experiences to become two substantially different people then imagine the range of differences between all of us.<br />There are so many thought-provoking sections of this book that it is hard to single out any one item.  Let me just note that the chapter which discusses mad cow disease and its human analogue, the laughing disease of New Guinea which was a major cause of death among the Fore Tribe.  Ridley's explanation of the role prisons play in causing these diseases is lucid and yet the science behind it is daunting.<br />For those who care about science education Ridley's approach to the mystery of knowledge explains a great deal about why the fact and memory based modern American approach to teaching science drives children away from the field.  Consider just this passage: &quot;The theme of this chapter is mystery.  A true scientist is bored by knowledge; it is the assault on ignorance that motivates him -- the mysteries that previous discoveries have revealed.  The forest is more interesting than the clearing.&quot;  We need a science education based on learning about the unknown rather than memorizing the known.  Ridley explains these principles again and again throughout the book.<br />If you care about the most important scientific revolution of the last twenty years this book is a very good starting point.	2001-04-18

The Prey series is essentially told from the standpoint of the police and the effort to get bad people before they do more bad things.  I found it such a satisfying series that I read all 12 of the Prey novels between Thanksgiving and February but only reviewed one of them out of respect for the reader's patience with my fixations.  The Kidd novels occur in a gray world of criminality with good intentions.  The cause is often noble but the characters are clearly outside society.<br />This novel, however, captures the challenges of an Internet based society and the potential for various elements to use the technology and undermine the system.  Much of America's software is now written overseas (especially in India).  Much of it could contain hidden material that would allow the original developer (or the person who paid or blackmailed them) to use and access data without anyone else knowing it.  There are interests including states who would pay very large sums for information gathered by American spy satellites.  The American intelligence agencies are losing a good bit of their edge as the knowledge base of the private sector (including hackers and outlaws) rises at a rapid rate.<br />I cannot help but like a novelist with the courage to write the following: \\"I got to know quite a few politicians.  They were a pretty lively bunch, no more or less corrupt than schoolteachers, newspaper reporters, cops, or doctors. Anyway, it didn't take much exposure to politics for me to realize that there are as many nuts on the left as there are on the right, and in the long run, the lefties are probably more dangerous.&quot;  Anyone with the courage to be that politically incorrect has my attention.<br />If you want to reflect on the American underground of people who function outside the law, the potential challenges of internet based crime and espionage and the potential of some systems creating real threats to our society this is a pretty good read.r society this is a pretty good read.	2001-04-11

Then he wrote Storm Warning, an extraordinarily good adventure novel. In total he has written 29 adventure books. Most have been pot-boilers (a nineteenth century term for light novels you read while waiting for the pot to boil).<br />Higgins developed a set of characters involved in counter espionage and trying to stop bad guys from succeeding. In the post cold war world he has found an increasing range of bad guys. Edge of Danger is worth reading as a reminder of several key realities of our time. There are many people with massive resources who may decide they dislike us for reasons of their own. They may have backgrounds that give them remarkable knowledge of and contacts in our society. A free society is remarkably open and vulnerable.<br />The details of this book are not believable but the overlying sense of vulnerability and threat are as real as the Taliban destroying priceless historic monuments and Osama bin Laden still holding press conferences eight years after the United States began trying to knock him out of the terrorist business. If you are looking for a quick read in a world of adventure and danger this will get your mind off whatever you have been worried about and remind you of the real threats the CIA and the FBI have to worry about. I look forward to Higgins' next work.	2001-03-21

You learn what their assumptions were, why they designed the military they did, what their strengths and weaknesses were and how those interacted in the campaigns that decided whether Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan would dominate the world. This remarkable work reflects years of thought on the topic by Murray and Millett.<br />They begin with this definitive description of the scale of the contest. &quot;World War II was the deadliest conflict in modern history. It continued World War I's slaughter of soldiers but then added direct attacks against civilians on a scale not seen in Europe since the 'Thirty Years' War three centuries earlier.&quot; (page vii)<br />Murray and Millett render judgment on some very interesting topics. They are vehement about the culpability of the senior British officers in refusing to promote armored specialists to command armored divisions and blame Alan Brooke and his colleagues for refusing to learn the lessons of the first years of the war and refusing to open their senior ranks to people who were capable of the speed and complexity of modern warfare but not part of the inner clique. Murray and Millett admire Eisenhower and Patton but are the harshest critics of Bradley that I have encountered.<br />The harshest condemnation comes for the German inability to believe their codes could be compromised or their intelligence service could be fooled. Murray and Millett note that the Soviet use of Maskirova (denial and deception) was consistently successful throughout the war once the fronts had been stabilized in December 1941. Again and again and yet again the Germans were surprised by Soviet offensives.<br />This is an impressive overview that any serious student of warfare should carefully read. For the interested citizen this is as good a one-volume introduction to the military side of the Second World War as you will find.as you will find.	2001-03-21

This novel was written in the middle of the Reagan Administration.  It captures the sense of intensity and fear that was at the heart of the Cold War. As I reread it (I first encountered it back in the 1980s) I was struck with how much of a period piece it is. Forbes accurately details the rivalry between the KGB and the British-American intelligence establishments. He flawlessly recalls the uneasy neutrality of Sweden and intimidated neutrality of Finland (all this long before Nokia became a worldwide brand). He brings us back to the Russian domination of the three Baltic States (Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) and the level of repression required to sustain it. You can feel the paranoia of the Russian senior political leadership and the brutality of their military-intelligence systems.<br />Cover Story keeps your attention throughout and has a powerfully surprising ending. If you still remain unsure about the President who knew an evil empire when he saw one, this book will convince you that we were very fortunate to have Reagan during those years. Forbes illustrates the alliance created by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and how that partnership changed the world. This book's very quaintness as a description of a world gone bye is a tribute to their lives and their remarkable achievement in winning the Cold War.	2001-03-21

The remarkable compilation of details by Ambrose brings to life a period and an epic adventure. Worthwhile alone as an unparallel introduction to the saga of the American West and Jefferson's role in making America an Empire of liberty. I found t his book so useful and so thought provoking that I hesitate to start in lest I quote a third of the book. Nonetheless, some observations should whet the appetite of anyone interested in the creation of modern America.<br />Native Americans played a decisive role in making the expedition possible. Without the help of Indians, and in particular the intervention of several women, the Lewis and Clark could not have survived the trip, they would not have lasted the two winters (both in camps being fed by Indians). They could not have found the trail across the Bitter Root Mountains between the two great water systems of the Missouri and the Columbia and they would have had no horses with which to carry their goods between the rivers. In short the expedition would have failed the first year if it had truly been going into an uninhabited wilderness.<br />Second, Jefferson was consistently driving America westward and was willing to manipulate and lie to do it. Modern liberals revere Jefferson as the most literary and intellectual of the Founding Fathers. Modern conservatives revere him as the advocate of limited government and limited taxation. Yet it was Jefferson who bought half a continent, misled the Congress about the purpose of the expedition to explore it and sent the Navy and the Marines to North Africa (from the shores of Tripoli was Jefferson's war) without Congressional authorization. He was a strong independent President with unlimited ambitions but a philosophy of limits that he simply ignored whenever it came into conflict with his goals of a vast America.<br />Finally, Republicans should note the cost to Federalists of rejecting the westward movement of America (Federalists opposed the purchase of Louisiana, opposed sending Lewis and Clark west and generally communicated to most Americans that they stood for an east coast tiny America). The country and the future rejected the Federalists and they ceased to exist as a party. Republicans are in no danger of ceasing to exist but their response to the tide of immigration is as vital and ultimately defining as the Federalists response to the West. Had Federalists embraced the West they would have remained a competitive party. If Republicans embrace the tide of new Americans they will be a new majority.<br />This is a book worth reading and thinking about. Ambrose is clearly one of our finest historians.the cost to Federalists of rejecting the westward movement of America (Federalists opposed the purchase of Louisiana, opposed sending Lewis and Clark west and generally communicated to most Americans that they stood for an east coast tiny America).

I strongly recommend you read that book first to get a general introduction to the amazingly different world of behavior below the level of about one hundred nanometers or 200 atoms. At that level the rules change profoundly. So much so that we do not seem to even understand quantum behavior but we do understand the effects of quantum behavior. That is, as Feynman described it in QED we can measure and predict with astonishing precision (accurate to the thickness of a hair measuring between two points one in New York and one in Los Angeles) what happens but we cannot explain why.<br />Gribbin seeks to create a deeper understanding of the principles of quantum behavior and the why of it. Gribbin explains elegantly why all this matters: &quot;the interactions of electrons with one another and with electromagnetic radiation determine almost everything about the world around us . . . All of chemistry is explained by quantum physics . . . biological life depends upon the behavior of complex molecules such as proteins and DNA, which is also chemistry and also depends ultimately on the quantum properties of electrons&quot;.<br />If you want to have a better understanding of the most powerful area of basic knowledge for the early 21st century you should read these three books and Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe. If after you get through it and it doesn't make sense then you are on the right track. You will, however, be closer to understanding quantum dynamics which will be as important for the first half of the 21st century as physics was in the 20th or electromagnetic theory and the internal combustion engine were for the second half of the 19th.<br />Gribbin does his best to make this subject both interesting and understandable and I recommend his two books to anyone willing to take the time to stop frequently to think about the amazing ideas they have encountered.deas they have encountered.	2001-03-21

The Kill Artist is told from the Israeli point of view but with a healthy dose of Palestinian interpretations of the last half-century. It is the story of an Israeli assassin who is lured out of retirement to kill a Palestinian who's own murders are legendary. The setting for this conflict pits two forms of organized state sponsored violence against one another.<br />The sense of mutual grievance and mutual willingness to kill for political and historic reasons is conveyed vividly.  In one passage, we gain insight into the motivation of the Palestinian character: \\"It came from growing up in the camps of Sidon.  His father had died when Tariq was young, and his older brother Mahmoud, was murdered by the Jews...He would think of his father--how he had died of a broken heart with the keys to the family home in the Upper Galilee still in his pocket.\\"(Page 43)<br />On the other side is the head of Israeli intelligence, a man in the Sharon tradition: \\"I believe we will be no more secure after a peace deal than before it. ... I believe the fire in the Palestinian heart will never be extinguished until the Jews are driven into the sea.  And I'll tell you one other thing ... I would much rather do battle with a sworn enemy than with an enemy who finds expediency in posing as a friend.\\"(Page 75)<br />The long-term challenge of peace in the region is vividly illustrated again by the intelligence chief:  \\"Everyone thinks now that peace is at hand there are no more threats to our survival. They don't understand that peace will only make the fanatics more desperate. They don't understand that we will need to spy on our new Arab friends just as hard as when they were openly committed to our destruction. A spy's work is never done.\\"(Page 76-77)<br />Silva deserves real credit for writing these prescient words and creating these characters when the Barak peace Prime Ministership was at its most optimistic and there was no sign on the horizon of the Camp David tragic overreach and the new wave of violence.<br />This novel is complex, compelling, and kept me enthralled to the point that I could not put the book down until had I finished it.

Whether they can truly find a road to peace or are trapped in the bitterness, fear and violence described in this novel will be a major issue in the next decade.

Its description of a high powered columnist setting up an innocent person on behalf of his high placed inside source certainly rings true with my experience of the less desirable parts of the Washington media.  And the description of a media firestorm engulfing an innocent and unprepared Air Force Colonel is realistic and a chilling reminder of the lynch mob mentality that occasionally gets under way.<br />Some parts of the conspiracy are too complicated and implausible, but the suspense is riveting and the action never stops throughout the novel. As an airplane or late night book to relax with it this book is a worthy addition in the Jack Higgins' tradition.	2001-01-31

Feynman was both a great physicist anda great communicator, but the subject is both important andperplexingly obscure. This book is based on the Alex G. MautnerMemorial Lectures given at UCLA.<br />Quantum behavior will matter to the21st century the way the steam engine mattered to the 18th and 19thcenturies, the way the internal combustion engine mattered to thefirst two-thirds of the twentieth century, and the way computers andtransistors have mattered to the last third of the twentieth. Tounderstand Quantum behavior you first have to understand themeasurements and scales involved. One billionth of a meter is a&quot;nanometer.&quot; It is how we measure things at the level ofmolecules and atoms. Quantum behavior is what starts happening innano-scale behavior below about 50 nanometers. The rules of physicssuddenly change at this level, and the way you and I were taught thatthe world works is suddenly replaced by very different rules.<br />AsFeynman said &quot;my main purpose in these lectures is to describe asaccurately as I can the strange theory of light and matter--morespecifically the interaction of light and electrons.&quot; Feynman isclear that the theory works in that it accurately predicts outcomes,but that we do not really understand what is happening or how thoseoutcomes are arrived at. In his words: &quot;What I am going to tellyou about is what we teach our physics students in the third or fourthyear of graduate school ... No, you're not going to be able tounderstand it. Why, then, am I going to bother you with all this? Whyare you going to sit here all this time, when you won't be able tounderstand what I am going to say? It is my task to convince you notto turn away because you don't understand it. You see, my physicsstudents don't understand it either. That is because I don'tunderstand it. Nobody does.&quot;<br />Feynman goes on to explain whyquantum behavior is so hard to accept: &quot;I'm going to describe toyou how Nature is--and if you don't like it, that's going to get inthe way of your understanding it.  It's a problem that physicists havelearned to deal with. They've learned to realize that whether theylike a theory or they don't like a theory is not the essentialquestion. Rather, it is whether or not the theory gives predictionsthat agree with experiment. It is not a question of whether a theoryis philosophically delightful or easy to understand, or perfectlyreasonable from the point of view of common sense. The theory ofquantum electrodynamics describes Nature as absurd from the point ofview of common sense. And it agrees fully with the experiment. So Ihope you can accept Nature as She is--absurd.&quot; Despite itsdifficulty and remarkable characteristics Feynman asserts that Quantumelectrodynamics is important to all of life. Consider: &quot;Most ofthe phenomena you are familiar with involve the interaction of lightand electrons--all of chemistry and biology for example. The onlyphenomena that are not covered by this theory are phenomena ofgravitation and nuclear phenomena; everything else is contained inthis theory.&quot;<br />&quot;The more you see how strangely Naturebehaves, the harder it is to make a model that explains how even thesimplest phenomena actually work&quot; is a Feynman observation thatgoes to the heart of our current situation. In traditional areas ofscience we are making rapid progress and some people think we are evenclose to the end of the scientific era or in a mature state. Yet inmany areas of science we are just beginning to understand thequestions and do not have a clue as to the answers. For example, 80%of the universe is dark matter and we currently know nothing aboutdark matter. Feynman's book is a good introduction to the frontiersthat beckon us to a great age of discovery in the 21stcentury.<br />Consider the possibility that at least at very tiny levelsa kind of time travel can occur. Here is the description of figure 63(p.96) &quot;the scattering of light involves a photon going into anelectron and a photon coming out--not necessarily in that order, asseen in example b. The example in c shows a strange but realpossibility; the electron emits a photon, rushes backwards in time toabsorb a photon, and then continues forward in time.&quot; Rememberthis is a great physicist lecturing a sophisticated general audienceabout the cutting edge of knowledge. There is much in this onedescription to think about. Feynman goes further on this topic:&quot;This phenomenon is general. Every particle in Nature has anamplitude to move backwards in time, and therefore has ananti-particle.&quot;<br />Feynman's argument is that quantum behavior istruly outside the Newtonian principles of classical physics andcontradicts our understanding of the world as we experience it at ourlarge, bulky level. &quot;Throughout these lectures I have delightedin showing you that the price of gaining such an accurate theory hasbeen the erosion of our common sense. We must accept some very bizarrebehavior...light traveling in paths other than a straight line,photons going faster or slower than the conventional speed of light,electrons going backwards in time...That we must do, in order toappreciate what Nature is really doing underneath nearly all thephenomena we see in the world.&quot;<br />This is a challenging but veryimportant book about a topic which will have enormous implications forour century but which remarkably few public minded citizens have paidany attention to.

He is a professor of Primate Psychology at Georgia Tech who has been the director of ZooAtlanta since 1984. He saved a zoo that was run by a city government and was on the verge of disaccreditation by transferring management responsibility to a  private association. This has allowed him to move the zoo from a poorly run, poorly managed institution that was not the best environment for its animals to one which has an amazing research focus, which has developed a world class gorilla, orangutan and Mandrill program, and allowed him to set his sights on bringing Pandas to Atlanta. In the process he was also a pioneer in privatizing government run zoos as ZooAtlanta has flourished as a privately run institution leased from the city.<br />Panda ethology is worth studying because it raises troubling questions about lessons we might need to learn about our own species. Consider the implications for overly bureaucratized education for humans while reading the following passages:<br />\\"Pandas receiving enrichment were much more active in the presence of the test stimuli, and in many cases stereotyped behavior was reduced or eliminated.  Enrichment was a strongly motivating condition in the lives of these animals... enrichment keeps pandas active.\\" (p.76)<br />\\"New social opportunities are often powerful motivators\\"(p.79) \\"Baby pandas do not show any signs of independence until the fourth month of life, and they may stay with their mothers into a second year.\\" Research has indicated that they stay \\"together two and a half years, about a year longer than most researchers thought was the norm\\".<br />Maple goes on to discuss a variety of lessons being learned about Panda behavior and many of them will stimulate you to think about challenges we face in understanding the best way to raise humans.<br />This book is also an excellent outline of the relationship between conservation in the wild and conservation in zoos and the degree to which both approaches are necessary if we are going to optimize biodiversity - especially for large vertebrates.

This remarkable campaign began with the British and French trying to cut off Axis iron ore supplies, which in winter came from Sweden through Norway to Germany, and ended with a decisive German victory. It is an amazing study of military incompetence on the part of Norway, Britain and France, and substantial competence on the part of the Germans.<br />The initial planning for the campaign by the British was astonishingly amateurish. The political leadership both micromanaged and failed to make major decisions simultaneously. Adding to the tension and complications were the French, desperate for the effort to take place because it would largely be the responsibility of the British.<br />With our perspective dominated by the stunning German defeat of France in May of 1940, it is hard for us to remember the earlier contemplations that year by the Allied military of campaigns in Sweden, Rumania and the Soviet Caucuses. There were serious advocates in France for attacking the Soviet Union to cut off German supplies. There seems to have been a blind faith at that time that the Allies would hold in Northeastern France and could focus on strangling the Germans.<br />This was a campaign in which the British resolutely refused to trust or listen to the Norwegians.  Their generals operated with tourist maps, and the communications were so bad that the unified commander was actually in London because no place in Norway could reliably communicate with any place else.<br />This is also a campaign in which the British Army commander was working under instructions that were directly opposite those given to the British naval commander. It is a great study in the need for unified command and a joint doctrine.<br />As a study in the follies of democracies in peacetime, the Norwegian failure to have any reliable defenses is a classic. The Germans were effective and professional but they were helped a lot by three allies who were amateurish, incompetent, and with deeply divided (and normally dishonest to one another) councils of war.professional but they were helped a lot by three allies who were amateurish, incompetent, and with deeply divided (and normally dishonest to one another) councils of war.	2001-01-10

I happened to run across this book while staying with a friend at Little St. Simon's Island  over Thanksgiving. It was one of those bibliophile moments when you are bored and perusing a bookcase of paperbacks. Suddenly I was enthralled. I like his characters so much that I have read four of his novels and am in the middle of two more in less than a month. I find I cannot put them down!<br />I actually cannot tell you precisely why I like these books so much, which may be the greatest testimonial I can give them as simply good reads.  Most of them are set in the Minneapolis area and the central characters are a homicide team that gets the toughest cases.  The central figure in the series is Lucas Davenport, a detective, then ultimately a vice-chief who made a good bit of money designing software games but is addicted to the dangers and complexities of solving difficult crimes and taking on violent criminals.<br />This particular novel involves the killing of a bank president in the middle of a merger. It has enough twists and turns to keep you turning the pages all night. The characters are believable and the plot is both engrossing and becomes very convincing as you get deeper into the characters' personalities, histories and motivation.<br />Sandford/Camp is to Minneapolis what Parker is to Boston and Archer was to Southern California. I highly recommend his works.	2000-12-29
US	49697848	RAGK7VN7KBMLZ	0875845851	889399178	The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail	Books	4	25	27	N	N	A Major Achievement	This is an extraordinary and important book that helps explain and put into perspective many of the changes our economy is going through.  It outlines clearly why successful firms find it easy to develop \\"sustaining\\" technologies and why they find it so extraordinarily difficult to develop the \\"disruptive\\" technologies that our economy and country need to continue moving forward and being successful.  The lessons Christensen develops apply to government as well as business and help explain why government-run systems in the areas of health, defense and education have lagged so far behind the private sector in developing breakthrough technologies.<br />The heart of Christensen's message is that \\"sustaining technologies\\" - improving upon something that you are already doing - are normally developed by firms that are already successful because they fit the existing markets' definition of value.  Thus an IBM, Intel, or U.S. Steel will naturally develop better ways of delivering the product they are already focused on. However the successful companies will almost never develop a \\"disruptive\\" technology - a radically new way of doing things, or a way of doing new things - precisely because they focus on their customers, and those customers almost never value a disruptive technology in its initial stages.<br />By definition, if your customers are structured to buy your product, they are not going to be immediately open to changing their structure to buy a new product.  They are going to be institutionally inclined to stay with their current structure and therefore your current product.<br />Thus a standard business plan would insist that the return on investment from a disruptive technology does not justify the time and effort necessary to make is successful. In short, it is not technological conservatism or bad management that inhibits the adoption of disruptive technologies by the dominant companies; it is precisely their intense and successful focus on their customers that leads them to rationally reject the future.<br />Christensen develops case after case in which we can see examples in history where the disruptive technology is developed by a new firm that actually has to go out and develop new markets for the product. Thus the large, successful steam shovel manufacturers were rationally not interested in a new innovation, hydraulic backhoes, because at their inception the backhoes could not do the mammoth jobs steam shovel customers needed (i.e. strip mining).  So the backhoe manufacturers, smaller start-up style companies, created their own market when they found that backhoes were invaluable if you had been digging ditches by hand for water pipes.  Over time the disruptive technologies are developed and become competitors to the lower end of the existing systems - smaller steam shovels that do smaller jobs could be taken out by a backhoe. Over more time the new technologies can displace the older ones.<br />Christensen develops a model for thinking about new technologies and for setting up small operations to develop them within a rational framework, while allowing the rest of the firm to focus on existing technologies.<br />In health, defense, education, and general government administration there are enormous gains to be made by studying Christensen's work and using his model.<br />For those who find the book useful, Christensen is putting his system on the Internet and has a consulting firm to help companies work on disruptive technologies.<br />This is a major work for anyone interested in how technologies emerge and how to develop them more rapidly and more profitably.that leads them to rationally reject the future.<br />Christensen develops case after case in which we can see examples in history where the disruptive technology is developed by a new firm that actually has to go out and develop new markets for the product.

If you have been looking for a Christmas gift for a friend who enjoys reading you can stop right here. Ambrose may be the best narrator of the American story in our generation, and this book will fit very nicely next to his studies of D-Day (D-Day June 6, 1944 : The Climactic Battle of World War II) and the Lewis and Clark Expedition (Undaunted Courage : Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West) as a brilliant description of a heroic tale.<br />Ambrose is particularly helpful because he blends together the technology that made the transcontinental railroad possible, the courageous visionaries who thought it through, the politics and lobbying that made it financially possible, The Irish and Chinese laborers who did the great bulk of the work, and the daring, high risk entrepreneurs who turned their dream of a nation united-by-rail into reality.<br />This book is also a useful reminder to its modern audience that much of American success has been a public-private partnership. In building the railroad, the Army played a key role in scouting the West and protecting the rail crews, and it profited from the railroad through dramatically lowered costs in time and money for moving forces and sustaining them. The government played the most critical role by providing finances and incentives. Without those public contributions the railroad could not have been built for at least another generation. Similarly, the government paid for another very important and related development at the time, the transcontinental telegraph.<br />On the other hand, the entrepreneurs at both the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific Railroads were vital in providing the drive, ingenuity and determination to get the railroads built. The same amount of money they contributed, if spent through a public bureaucracy, would not have gotten the railroad built. In fact, even a vastly greater amount of money spent through a public bureaucracy would not have built the railroad as rapidly as these entrepreneurs were able to build it.<br />Ambrose also makes clear that the railroad was an instrument of transformational change. Combined with the telegraph it dramatically shortened distances and lowered costs, which provides an interesting and useful context for many of the changes we are experiencing today because it revolutionized the lives of average people.<br />It took a nation to build a transcontinental country, but private individuals profited immensely in both time and money from the investment once it was made. The rise of the modern American economy and the creation of enormous industrial and agricultural wealth were both by-products of this remarkable achievement.<br />This is a book that reminds you of the intense optimism and spirit of practical achievement which have been at the heart of the American culture for the last three centuries. It will renew your understanding and appreciation of why this country attracts people from across the planet and then makes them glad they got here.d as rapidly as these entrepreneurs were able to build it.<br />Ambrose also makes clear that the railroad was an instrument of transformational change.

Parker has developed both a character worth knowing (along with her divorced but still friendly ex-husband, her dog, her slightly neurotic sister, and the rest of the extended family) and another plot worth reading about.<br />His specialty is just enough action to keep you moving while offering enough observations about life and people to keep you thinking.  In some ways Parker does for Boston what Lew Archer did for Southern California a generation ago.  If you like relaxing and learning Parker is your man and Perish twice is a nice addition to the genre.	2000-12-07

Schweizer explains why Clancy is more correct than all the news media and intellectual elites who scorned Reagan when he was in office and have ignored his achievements ever since.<br />Much of the news media and liberal academia would have you believe that Gorbachev was the hero who modernized the Soviet Union and liberated it from the past.  Schweizer outlines in detail the long strategic effort to defeat the Soviet Union through a multiplicity of specific strategies.  From delaying and minimizing the natural gas pipeline to western Europe, to working with the Saudis to bring down the price of oil (the number one source of hard currency for the Soviet Union), to actively working to cut off technology from reaching the Soviet Union, to launching an arms race of high technology systems that would bloc obsolesce the old systems and force the Soviets into an exhausting effort to keep up, to financing opposition forces in Afghanistan, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Central America.<br />Again and again Schweizer shows the methodical determined efforts of the Reagan team to undermine and roll back the Soviet Union.  Trying to describe the end of the Soviet Empire without Reagan is like trying to describe the South losing the Civil War without mentioning Lincoln and Grant.  This book should be read by every citizen interested in just how effective their country can be when it has a strategy and courageous disciplined leaders.	2000-11-30

In this novel Clancy brings alive two very major challenges to America's current role in the world.<br />First, Clancy outlines a believable coalition of anti-American nations united only by a desire to profit from our difficulties.  Second, he chillingly describes the horrors of a biological epidemic deliberately unleashed by someone who is driven by hatred.<br />It is worth enduring the too long and too frequent Jack Ryan speeches and maudlin introspection to get to the 80% of the book which outlines a world that could be and dangers that are all too real.  This is one of Clancy's more thought provoking novels.	2000-11-30

He captures the post-World War II environment and introduces you to Earl Swagger,  young Marine who returns home to do a new kind of duty.<br />In earlier works Hunter described Swagger's son as a Vietnam Marine who was a master sniper and his adventures both in uniform and out.

It is first a great social  history of improbable invention.  Take an English computer specialist  working at CERN (the European Nuclear Research Consortium in Switzerland)  who comes up with an idea for a worldwide system of easy communications  that merely means he has to invent the concept of the URI and URL system of  universal identifiers on a web of interconnected computers so that users  can find specific sites.  Then create a single protocol for www that  everyone on the planet will get used to including http as a protocol for  transferring information across a variety of systems, and do all of this on  a voluntary basis subsidized by a nuclear research facility that was  focused on vastly different questions.<br />This is the story of that stunning  achievement but would be worth reading for only its own insights into  technology and how societies evolve and how a determined creative and  patient individual can impact on that evolution.  However, this book is  much more.  It is second an introduction to a way of thinking about the web  as a truly interactive system that allows people on a worldwide basis to  work together.  Berners-Lee notes that his vision of the web is not merely  passive reading and passive accessing but the creation of a truly universal  ability for people to work together and create a mutually better and more  productive society by bringing people together as individuals on a  worldwide basis.  I found myself thinking much more about truly interactive  participatory ideas with the web and how would you manage that level of  creativity and group participation.  This is a very worthwhile and easy to  read story.	2000-09-07

J. Boyd is one of the scientists at the NASA-Ames laboratories.  He gave me his copy of this terrific book with the  recommendation that it was a good introduction to the principles behind  quantum mechanics.<br />The Ames laboratories in California is conducting  research into the fascinating world of nano-science.  The nano world may be  the most powerful new areas of understanding. &quot;Nano&quot; is the space  between one atom and about 400 atoms.  At this level quantum behavior  begins to replace the Newtonian (no relation) physics you and I are used  to.  The world &quot;nano&quot; means one-billionth and is usually used in  reference to a nanosecond (one billionth of a second) or a nanometer (one  billionth of a meter).  In this world of atoms and molecules, new tools and  new techniques are enabling scientists to create entirely new approaches to  manufacturing, computing and to health resulting in new and very powerful  capabilities. ...<br />To understand fully the future impact on  nano-science and it will be significant, I felt it imperative to try to  understand the basics of quantum mechanics. Greene is a very engaging young  physicist at Columbia University and he does a solid job of carrying you  into very complicated topics in understandable ways.  Nonetheless there are  places in the Elegant Universe where this book is best read about six pages  at a time with a few minutes for thinking through the ideas he has  explained. We are in an era of amazing change in our understanding of the  universe and this book is a very readable introduction to the science  behind those changes.	2000-08-31

It is particularly useful to read this book after Kaplan's  The Coming Anarchy (also reviewed).  Kaplan makes clear there will be a lot  more destruction of humanity that will require American leadership and the  use of force.  Daalder and O'Hanlon make clear that we have a lot to learn  if we are going to engage in campaigns like Kosovo.<br />Anyone who plans to  advise the next Administration would be well served by reading these two  books together and pondering their implications for improving American  decision making and coalition leadership skills in the context of  interventions in dangerous places.  The clearest points in this book are  Daalder and O'Hanlon's judgments that this was the right war, it was  ultimately a success, airpower had a powerful but limited influence and  without the threat of a land campaign and the Russian abandonment of  Milosevic.  In their view, airpower by itself would have failed, and that  the United States has to lead for these interventions to work and the  Clinton Administration consistently failed to lead the public, the Congress  or our allies and because of the Clinton's Administrations prior  vacillation on Saddam Hussein (loud threats, tiny attacks that ended  quickly without coercing Saddam).  The confused posturing of the Clinton  Administration actually increased the likelihood that force would have to  be used because Milosevic had no reason to believe they would actually  fight to the end. Once NATO had consolidated its position and the  Administration had launched the gamble of forceful coercion Daalder and  O'Hanlon give Clinton and the allies high marks for realizing that NATO had  to win or cease to be relevant and they stepped up to the challenge.  Their  critique of the Clinton Administration is decisive and thorough:  &quot;Having failed to make a public case for the use of force, the Clinton  administration opted for a minimalist strategy.  Its hope was that a bit of  bombing would work.  This was the military equivalent of the 'Hail Mary'  play in football.  Not only was this an irresponsible way to go to war, it  also was unnecessary.  A case for decisive military action-at a minimum, a  robust air campaign from the war's outset--could have been made.  The  American public would probably have supported such a strategy given its  disdain for Milosevic and memories of the Bosnian war.  The tragedy of this  case is that, in fearing the absence of public and congressional support,  the administration embarked on the use of force lacking both.  That is no  basis for taking the tremendous risks that the use of force necessarily  implies.&quot; (pages 224-225).

He is a very intelligent patriotic career Naval officer who showed as much courage in  the Pentagon as he did on the sea.  He saw the need for a new  information-age approach to national defense and he fought for it despite  enormous bureaucratic opposition.  When someone proposes a 50% (yes 50%)  reduction in procurement bureaucracy in the Pentagon (page 234) then you  can understand how many institutions and careers he is threatening.<br />This  book is a clear indictment both of the Clinton-Gore Administration's  approach to defense (under-funding and overusing the military thus  stretching it to exhaustion and near the breaking point in Owens' analysis)  and also a tough critique of the isolated service mentality and the  unnecessary duplication and waste which still dominates the defense system  despite a decade of talking about &quot;jointness&quot;.  If you care about  America's continued ability to lead in the world this is a book you will  want to read.  It is also a book you should call your Congressman and  Senators and ask them to read.  In fact it is a book both Gore and Bush  should comment on in the campaign.	2000-08-15

When  that book is written by someone who has reported from Afghanistan,  sub-Saharan Africa, Bosnia and Kossovo among other places it is a book  worth reading. When he raises profound questions about the assumptions of  both our conservative and liberal elites and paints vivid pictures of  dangers unimagined by a peaceful society sheltered by decades of safety  then it is a work worth thinking about long and hard.<br />I would recommend  this book to anyone interested in understanding the challenges we will face  in the next thirty years.	2000-05-03

This is also a very sobering novel for any American who assumes that our economic prosperity,  our international position of unchallenged leadership and the stability of  our political institutions are safe and unchallengeable.  Pressfield's  novel carries Athens from a position of stunning power and wealth just  before the beginning of the Peloponnesian War to its defeat and subjugation  to the Spartans after 29 years of conflict.<br />Athens was so powerful and so  wealthy that it could survive a plague that may have killed one-third of  its population (brought on probably by the need to crowd inside the city's  walls to avoid the Spartan Army) and it could fight off Sparta, most of  Greece and the Persians for decades.  Pressfield makes vivid the decay of  Athenian democracy into a bloodthirsty system of revenge and brutality that  helps us better understand our own founding fathers' fears of mob rule,  tyranny and direct democracy.  He uses the life of Alcibiades, a brilliant  general and politician whose victories were undermined by his enemies, as a  thread that holds together a generation of war and pain.<br />This is a  slightly demanding book to read but it will profoundly trouble anyone who  worries about the human propensity to repeat history rather than learn from  it.  There is much in this work for any American to think about.	2000-05-02

He brings the scientists logic and knowledge to answering the question, why do Eurasians  represent the most prosperous, powerful elements of mankind if there is no  genetic difference and indeed, as Diamond realizes, if there might actually  be stronger genetics in some parts of the world that did not develop as  rapidly.  His answer is a sweeping review of the rise of agriculture, the  nature of disease among large populations, the geographic range of  domesticatable large mammals (none in sub-Saharan Africa, only the llama in  the New World, none in Australia), and the ability of competitive large  populations (made possible by the east-west spread of agricultural and  cultural knowledge in Eurasia and blocked from moving north and south  through different climate zones in Africa and the New World) to both  develop more advanced technologies and to build resistance to communicable  diseases.  Humans outside Europe and Asia lacked the populations to acquire  enough communicable diseases to develop resistance to them, lacked the  agricultural knowledge to sustain large enough competitive populations to  develop technologies (something which was beginning to be overcome in the  New World but in isolated centers in the Andes and the Mexico-Central  American centers). This is a book whose reasoning will stretch your mind  and insights will lead you to knew thoughts.  It is definitely worth  reading.	2000-04-17

If you like Golf you will find this an intriguing book with a few mystical pages that may be confusing or  seem pointless but a lot of vivid almost lyric description of the people,  the game and the era.  It is a fun read but maybe especially so for  golfers.  It is totally different from his Greek novels and that may be a  tribute to the range of his writing skill.	2000-04-17

A wounded Greek prisoner of war explains to the Persians the nature of Spartan society and why the Greeks preferred to die fighting for their freedom rather than behave reasonably and accept the inevitability of the overwhelming Persian forces.  Pressfield's description of the values and psychology of Spartan society  is vivid and compelling.  His description of the physical intimacy and  brutality of man to man combat in a phalanx is unforgettably vivid.  A  brilliant book, anything by Pressfield is worth reading.	2000-04-13

He outlines thebitter and decisive British defeat by the Japanese in 1942, the slow, painful rebuilding of the British-Indian-African Army and its collaboration with the Chinese and Americans in a see-saw campaign against the Japanese in 1943, the decisive battle of Imphal in 1944 and the crushing victories of 1945.  In the mountainous and jungle terrain of the Burma-India theater Slim pioneered in the use of airpower for logistical support and the development of airbridges built around air fields.  In many ways this under-supported and often neglected theater fought the most modern campaign of the second world war.  Slim is a revealing and deliberate author-teacher who intended this book both as a report on a great campaign and as a series of lessons for future students of the art of war.  The opening hundred pages are a little slow and the place names are never easy but the book is well worth reading for anyone who would seek to understand leadership and victory in warfare.	2000-04-13

It is a very sobering and very realistic reminder of how  dangerous war can be, how easy it is to become overconfident with  disastrous results, and how different standards and experiences can be in  other countries. Anyone who would like to better understand the modern  world and the role of violence in our times would learn by reading this  book.  Every serious citizen of American survival should read it.	2000-04-13

It takes three fictional characters (a mother, her son, and a botanist) and uses their personalities and vantage points to develop a human size story within the saga of Texas  Independence.  It also deftly portrays both Mexican and Texan viewpoints  and emotions. A worthwhile novel for those interested in history as seen  through fiction.	2000-04-13
