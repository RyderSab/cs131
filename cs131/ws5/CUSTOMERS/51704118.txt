The romance was well-developed and Annabelle was a strong female character. The mystery of the sabotage was a nice sub-plot and there were no unneccessary characters bogging down the flow. I can't wait for the next book in the series. All in all a great read for a rainy day.	2005-09-25

When I read the back cover of New Rules in the store and people were staring at me while I snickered, I knew I had to own this book.  This book lampoons everyone and everything, from President Bush and the war in Iraq to TomKat, Paris Hilton and reality TV. Some of the funniest 'rules' include Panned Parenthood, Crude Awakening, Storm Frontin' and any reference to Classmates.com.<br />Bill Maher has his finger on the pulse of America and says what he wants and doesn't care who he pisses off.	2005-08-14

Most of the essays weave all three together, ending with a relavant recipe. I wish I had half her guts, I mean she travelled to Central America while an 18-year-old student at Vanderbilt University, embraced the people and food (and drink) of Bolivia and writes in retrospect \\"I didn't save any souls. I didn't change anybody's life but mine.\\" What more is there? She writes of the Rhinestone Cowgirls \\"To women, girlfriends aren't a luxury. They're a healthy necessity, like good skin or good hair...\\" Spot on. Her sixtieth birthday hike is inspirational, I hope I can be half as cool at that age.<br /><br />Insightful and funny, Ellerbee writes from the heart. And so it goes.	2005-08-14

I bought this guide well in advance of a recent family trip to the 'old country' (as my Nana called it) kind of as a joke - but I'm really glad I did. It has everything from packing tips (if you don't have enough room for souvenirs, mail your dirty laundry home - what a hoot!) to budgeting worksheets and maps included. We bought the Explorer pass as recommended and had a blast. We purchased more detailed maps there as well, but as far as planning the trip out, this book is the cats pajamas. I like how it is broken down by region, it makes it super easy to plan a day or two ahead. Before I take another trip like this, I'll check for a 'dummies' book.	2005-07-24

Black Rose continues the story of Harper House, its inhabitants (living and not) and In The Garden, where they all work. Roz is pretty much the focus of this book, she is just a great character, she is definitely strong in most respects and the scene at the country club with her ex was one of the highlights. Not all of the loose ends were tied up and I can't wait for Red Lily to be published.	2005-07-06

I felt connected with the characters right away, which is a big part of whether or not I even finish reading a book. I laughed and cried a little as I read about the adventures of the 'Beach Girls' - as they were and what they became. The use of flashbacks is a clever tool, the characters are closely intertwined. Young Nell is a spitfire and helps to bring it all together, with some help from the mysterious Stevie. I will definitely be checking out more from this author.	2005-07-06

It is a lot of information to digest, but I thought worth it. A lot of times I was laughing as I read because I remember a couple of years ago when everything at my employer was \\"5S\\" this, lean that - only they had it all wrong and management's interest fizzled after a couple of months. In the case of our plant manager, thirty years of manufacturing experience puts him at a disadvantage, especially with the concept of producing in small quantities and doing more version changes. I think management should definitely get with this program, because soon it will be what has to happen to be competitive.	2005-03-19

I spend at least one weekend a month on the road in search of good music and new friends or just following my favorite hockey team. This guide helped me learn how to have as much, if not more, fun on the journey as the destination, if I even have a specific one now. I keep this guide in my glovebox and it's always calling out to me \\"psst! Let's get out of here!\\"  Especially funny are the reasons to hit the road that run across the bottom of every page and the 'are you a road sister?' quiz. There are also seriously helpful hints like how to deal with common car problems and getting pulled over.<br /><br />I also recommend the Bad Girls rage-a-Day calendar for when it's time to return to reality. In the meantime, hit the road Jill!	2004-08-10

I liked mostly the fact that for once both of the main characters were in the Navy, not just the male lead.

I was not disappointed. Nia, a journalist, and Dan, a pro basketball coach, are very likeable and meet under interesting circumstances. While some of the references are dated, their romance is not. I like how they do not get along at first, they get to know each other, he helps her through a tragedy and chooses love before his career when a pushy boss gets in the way. There are few other characters and that is nice too, some books have way too many small characters introduced for no reason. All in all a great story	2004-06-29

I 'abandoned ship' on this book towards the end when there was an explosion on the aircraft carrier - the same thing happened in Macomber's 'Navy Wife' book.

I felt sorry for them, I was angry with them and relieved when young Michael woke up.

I read this one in a couple of hours (one of four that day on the beach) and was very happy with it. I was glad to see the addition of a bit of mystery to the ranch theme, with two of the main characters working in law enforcement. There are some shady characters, sabotage on the ranch and even murder. Young Christabel is one of the most liberated females Palmer has written. Although she's still virginal and niaive, she's quite sassy and that's most of what kept me reading. The ending seems rushed in this one, but I look forward to reading about lawman Cash and Tippy the movie star/model.	2004-06-27

The characters were engaging, the settings were vivid and the story was intense. There were lots of chances for Jack to leave, but he stuck by his ex-wife Rachel's side throughout her coma, meeting her new friends from her new life and caring for the teenage daughters who barely remembered him. One daughter is already coping with the loss of a beloved pet, the other is 'fifteen going on thirty'. Throughout, he finds himself remembering the good times with his ex-wife and decides to rededicate himself to his family, quitting his high-stress job that kept him away from them in the first place. I was moved to tears at several points, something a book rarely does for me. I highly recommend this book.	2004-06-21

I recieve the Far Side day-by-day calendar as a gift every year for Christmas and always found myself saving more and more of the days every year. I recently threw out my scrapbook of yellowing calendar pages and bought this wonderful collection. Wow, what a move up! After a tough day at work, on a rainy day or basically any other time is perfect to thumb through this deluxe collection. It is not a rush-to-production, strike-while the iron is hot collection. This set was well thought out, well-packaged and even better made than anything I have seen, deluxe is almost not enought to describe it.<br /><br />My favorite personal Far Side story is the day (about twelve years ago) I wore a shirt to high school with a reproduction of the &quot;Midvale School for the Gifted&quot; panel on it, with my alma matter's name substituted. I was ordered to turn the shirt inside out or go home. Duh, I took the day off! As I read the excerpts of letters included from people who haven't been blessed with a sense of humor, I keep expecting to see one from my high school principal!

Sure the book talks about Nashville's rich history and some of its landmarks, but the book is more about 'waking up' in a sense of opening your eyes to the business that is country music. The author talks about labels being swallowed up by other labels, the 'plastic cowboys' of the 1990s and how many new acts fail (versus becoming successful artists)in the little big town that is Nashville. I found it very interesting because I am a marketing major and there are a lot of facts and figures about what it actually costs to make and promote a record.<br /><br />The author talked with Jill King when she was doing sets for basically no money at Tootsie's and dreaming of a record deal. Now she has released &quot;Jillbilly&quot; - it would be interesting to have an epilogue with her. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a behind-the-scenes look at the music industry, but not so much if you want a tourist guide to Nashville.	2004-02-15

I think there were too many who were introduced for no real reason (like Cade's eccentric aunt). Tory's 'ability' seemed a bit unbelieveable at times, but her determination to make a name for herself in her hometown - where she didn't have any warm, fuzzy memories - made her a great lead anyway. And she found romance with Cade the older brother of her murdered childhood best friend. I thought I had the murderer figured out, but was proven wrong at the end.	2003-12-23

I found myself quickly pulled into this story by the 'whodunit' aspect, I thought twice I had the killer pegged and was wrong both times! The main characters Sarah Jane and &quot;Silk&quot; are interesting and their chemistry together is wonderful. Also interesting is Lorett, the woman who raised Sarah Jane after both her parents died, she brings a supernatural aspect to the story. The suspense in this story will keep you turning the pages and the ending is a shocker!! Dark Water was my first Sala book, but won't be my last.	2003-10-29

Plus the Nanny on topics like Men, Do I Know Kids or What?, Big Hair and Beauty, the Fine Men, the Fine Women, Ma, the British, herself, and more.

Delinsky uses a great mix of romance, drama and even a bit of comedy. The main characters had interesting careers (one a corporate CEO and the other a famous photographer) and a tragically intertwined past. I like how Marni stands up to her father when she realizes Brian is the thing she wants even more than her powerful job running the family business - which she was basically pushed into after the tragic death of her brother, in an accident that left Brian severely wounded. Love conquers all in this story and it brings a smile to my heart.	2003-09-08

It is very different, although the rest of the story is trademark Roberts - the characters start off on the wrong foot and spend much of the story fighting the inevitable.  The ending is a bit confusing, but the story is still interesting, romantic and (at times) comical and even sad.<br /><br />I borrowed this book, it was a quick read and cute.	2003-08-21

In this case model Hillary is bad-mouthing magazine magnate Bret Bardoff to the handsome stranger that has wandered into her photographer's studio, realizing too late that it is the 'man from the mountain' (as she calls him). Throughout the book she tries to keep the relationship purely professional, even though she wants more and he does too. There are a few obstacles and they both fight the pull, but the ending is very romantic.<br /><br />Find a comfy chair on a rainy day and get lost in this story.	2003-08-21

The settings are vivid and the characters highly enjoyable in this early Nora Roberts work featuing 'Jo' as the herione, a lion-trainer with an old-school  travelling circus. When the circus' owner dies, his big city lawyer son 'Keane' takes over. Of course Jo and Keane fight it at first, but the sparks fly. There are a couple of funny moments in the book, an incredibly sad moment involving Jo's favorite animal and a very tense scene in a cage.<BR><br />This book is a relatively quick read, good for a rainy day.

From how they came up with the process for making french fries to the dangerous slaughterhouses. While McDonalds is not the only corporation holding down and eliminating the 'little man' in the battle for the public's buck, it is certainly one of the worst offenders.<br /><br />Some of the figures are hard to slog through, but they paint a picture that too few people will see because most of America is busy handing over their hard-earned cash to the underpaid teenagers working the drive-through at their local fast food restaurant.	2003-08-09

Both of the female leads were career women, independent and successful, I found myself admiring Juliet especially. Their careers take unexpected turns when they meet the most exasperating men they will ever work with (and love). In the first story, Summer is hired by hotel mogul Blake Cochran to revamp the kitchen of one of his properties. The second story pairs globetrotting chef Carlo Franconi with straight-laced publicist Juliet Trent as they promote his latest book. Carlo is introduced in the first story as a friend of Summer.<br /><br />Both stories were extremely enjoyable and a cool glimpse into a world otherwise unknown to me. And food...always a great topic! Highly recommended!	2003-08-05

Many others have posted summaries of the plot, so I'll just give my personal opinion - some of the dialogue is hard to digest, but the characters are wonderfully developed and the settings are spectacular. You have to take the good with the bad and I think this book was mostly good, truly a must-read for Nora Roberts fans.	2003-08-02

All three stories are well-written and will pull you right in. The characters are charming, sassy and sometimes frustrating - totally human all of them. The romantic tension between the main characters is perfection. Nora Roberts writes about the lives of a concert pianist, a doctor, a bush pilot, a schoolteacher, a documentary producer and a Hollywood agent as if she has worn all of these hats herself, the stories flow well.<br /><br />I really cannot say a bad thing about this collection of stories.

More than once I found myself wanting to slap the heroines (even calling them that is a stretch) - all three are proper and meek to the point of frustration. The men are equally as frustrating, but to the other extreme - they are all male testo-pigs. But, to feel as strongly as I do about the characters, they must been well-written.

It starts off detailing the relationship of and Amanda and Gray, but after they are married, expands to include their close-knit neighborhood.  I started out disliking the young, pregnant widow Gretchen (as the other women characters did), but as they got to know her, so did I.

During a weeklong layoff earlier this month, I read a lot of books, but this one was easily one of my favorites. The first story, Local Hero, was kind of an emotional rollercoaster. I found myself smiling thinking of Hester, Rad and Mitch playing in the snow together in Central Park and a lump in my throat at the end (which I won't give away). Five star story<br /><br />Like other reviewers I found Dual Image a little harder to get into, but I am a lot like Ariel, so I just had to see what she was getting into! Booth is definitely a piece of work. The twist at the end of this story will knock you for a loop. Four stars.	2003-07-12

I don't know how she does it, but Rebecca Cole delights, amazes and inspires me again! Her third book contains arrangements from the whimsical to sassy and she breaks them down step-by-step, like a big floral arrangement cookbook. I have attempted the Checkerboard Flower Box (about half the size of the one in the book) and it lasted nearly two weeks, thanks to the wonderful conditioning tips. My other favorite section is the Welcoming Windows, about making the all important first impression. Throughout the book, Rebecca Cole shares personal stories from her childhood.<br /><br />Helen Norman's photographs are breathtaking - sharp and colorful - and there are a LOT of them.

If you aren't a fan, buy it anyway and it will make you a fan! He is hot!	2002-01-28

I bought this calendar because Jo Dee Messina does not have her own.  I guess one month is better than none.  I am a big fan of 'girl power', so I am glad to see Martina, Lee Ann Womack, the Chicks, and Ms. Yearwood!!!  For the guys, Tim and the super-fine Kenny Chesney represent!!  I wish Lonestar was not included tho - there would have been more room for Kenny!	2002-01-28

This calendar has 16 of the best pictures of Dale Earnhardt Jr. and his #8 Budweiser ride ever assembled!!  I am a fan of the personal pics of Jr., and wish there were more of him and fewer of the car!  This calendar has super sized boxes - a rarity in previous calendars I have bought, which have had tiny or no boxes at all.<br /><br />This item is a must-have for the Earnhardt Jr. fan!!	2002-01-28

I have always considered myself a fairly proficient eBay-er, but this book has helped me fine tune my habits.  It may not be as helpful to more experienced user, but is definitely great for the beginner to intermediate user.<br />This book breaks down buying and selling point by point, everything from how to find exactly what you are looking for to a bidding practice called 'sniping' (which I use A LOT!).  It also has lots of eBay's rules and is incredibly easy to read.  There is really not much more I can say about it than that.	2001-04-02

It is difficult to learn conversational Bosnian from this book, but I can pick out words.  I work with a dozen or so Bosnians and they have helped me with my pronunciation.  Bosnian-Croatian-Sebian languages are difficult to learn on your own.  This book is convenient, my copy is very beat up from carrying it around in my pocket forever.  It would be in your best interests to partner this book with a native speaker if available.	2000-09-24
