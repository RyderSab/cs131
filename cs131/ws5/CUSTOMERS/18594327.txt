I expected a light jaunt across Oz, some behind the scenes revelations, mainly I wanted to get the inside scoop on that Wicked Witch who caused Dorothy such vexation. <br /> <br />Turns out Wicked wasn't so wicked afterall. Just a misunderstood victim of circumstances: daughter of a promiscuous mom, disliked by her dad, and sadly...she's green. However, I never found out why.  <br /> <br />The poor tin man whom I've always pitied is a victim of domestic violence. That shouldn't have surprised me because in the origianl story,he did exhibit martyr characteristics.  <br /> <br />The book morphs from light and breezy to to dark, graphic, and sexually explicit in a blink of an eye. There's a scene where a man amazingly develops an extra set of genitalia to pleasure two women simultaneously. Now, I wasn't prepared for that.  <br />That scene is so disturbing it's practically satanic and I applaud the author for taking the risks he took. <br />  <br />My only disappointment was that Elphaba (that's the Wicked Witch's real name) wasn't quite wicked. Many of the supporting characters were far worse than she. <br /> <br />All in all, this is an amazing book. I couldn't put it down.	2005-09-18

When her husband, Leo announces that the pressure of domesticity is weighing him down and needs a six month \\"time-out\\" Julieanne pleads with him to reconsider. He doesn't. He takes off, with the empty promise of returning in six monts, to a commune far away from home. He doesn't even leave a forwarding address. <br /> <br />With the recently acquired status of single parent and breadwinner of three (two teens and a toddler) Julieanne is stressed beyond belief. That stress is followed by puzzling medical symptoms that are soon diagnosed as MS. <br /> <br />The reader goes along on the journey with this family guided by the voice of Julieanne and her mildly disabled teen son, Gabe. Gabe's voice will touch any mother's heart. He's been victimized by his peers due to his LD but the reader quickly learns that Gabe possesses depth and sensitivity and intelligence that would make any mother proud. When his mother becomes too ill to properly care for baby Aury, Gabe steps up to the plate without complaining.  <br /> <br />We don't get Julieanne's daughter Caroline's perspective through her own voice, but we're made aware that Caroline seems too self-absorbed to be affected by the unraveling of her family. Later, we learn that Caroline was simply using the only coping skills she could access during the most troubling and confusing time of her life. <br /> <br />Caroline concocts a plan for damage control: go to the commune and fetch the father who deserted them. Surely once he finds gets a first hand account of the terrible troubles at home, he'll come running back, shame-faced and begging for forgiveness. Dad, however, is none too happy to see his two offspring. He's already started another family with a younger woman. <br /> <br />Amazingly, this family bonds together and with the help of a familyfriend and new rich husband for Julieanne, there's a happily ever after for everyone. Even baby Aury. <br /> <br />A touching read, which Mitchard tied up nicely at the end.	2005-09-16

Getting therapy to help with her grief was never considered an option by her well-meaning but controlling father, leaving Trudy with unresolved grief issues. When she is robbed and molested at her father's liquor store where she works, Trudy represses her rage and again does not seek therapy. She believes that placing herself in a better working environment will provide the healing she so desperately needs. Additionally, she perceives working for a glamorous travel agency as her last hoorah before settling down with her dull fiance, James. <br /> <br />Her employment with Bon Voyage Travel agency, however, is the catalyst for her pent-up anger, resentment, and feelings of unworthiness to manifest into behaviors Trudy would have never believed herself capable of expressing.  <br /> <br />Ann Oliver, Trudy's boss, is an attractive, educated, self-assured, self-involved woman who is well-traveled and speaks two languages. Feeling dual emotions of envy and admiration toward Ann, Trudy allows the woman to continually disrespect her. <br /> <br />Ann is an enigma. Typically, insensitive, shallow, and demanding, she regards Trudy with indifference and often with disdain. On the other hand, she'll turn right around and extend warmth, sensitivity, and even sisterhood. Ann's many mood swings keep Trudy emotionally imbalanced and also resentful. <br /> <br />Trudy develops a love/hate relationship with Ann and slowly seeks revenge by running up Ann's credit while smiling in her face. She also starts taking on the woman's persona--changing her drab appearance and developing a fierce craving for the finer things in life. But it doesn't stop there. With access to Ann's credit card for work-related spending, Trudy begins to make personal purchases and her spending quicklysprials out of control.  <br /> <br />Phony ID in Ann's name provides Trudy with nearly unlimited credit and an addiction to spending. Trudy has become an identity thief who can't get a grip on the extravagant and often senseless spending she's doing in Ann's name. <br /> <br />Freddie, Trudy's best friend, warns Trudy of the dire consequences that may befall her, but she and boyfriend, LoBo go along for the free ride. <br /> <br />The surprise ending caught me off guard and I wouldn't dare give it away. <br /> <br />Mary Monroe has taken a current topic that is a thorn in the side of American society. However, she's made the identity thief a sympathetic character. Although Trudy's morals are a bit skewed, she considers herself an honest person and society would definitely view her as being trustworthy and harmless. In our minds, the identify thief looks sinister and exhibits unscrupulous behaviors...someone of dubious character whom one would never allow to run rampant with a company credit card. <br /> <br />Mary Monroe is an extraordinary writer and I'm a fan for life.	2005-09-15

These ex-spouses work together in solving crimes--mostly gory, brutal, unspeakable crimes. The latest is a young girl found buried, presumably, alive. There's a pipe protruding from her burial place which should have provided air, but an autopsy reveals that the young girl who happens to be a member of a religious cult did not suffocate but was killed by cyanide, which was poured down the breathing tube. <br /> <br />Further investigation reveals that the cult welcomes ex-cons who apparently haven't been rehabilitated. This book is not for the weak of heart. There are very graphic descriptions of murder victims. There is a subplot on domestic violence which is very revealing and it may be difficult for the reader to comprehend how a seemingly rational woman would allow herself to be continually victimized.  <br /> <br />The relationship between the Sara and Jeffrey remains unresolved, leaving room for at least a couple more books revolving around the strained relationship between this couple. <br /> <br />I enjoy Slaughter's writing style and her willingness to take the reader out of his/her comfort zone while she delivers blow after blow of gut wrenching horrors that humans--in this case--in the name of God--do unto each other.	2005-09-08

For me, Henry's ailment known as Chrono Displaced Person was really a metaphor for our lives. He travels back and forth through time never quite knowing where he'll end up and the time traveling tends to occur when he's feeling stressed. In our lives, often under stressful circumstances, we feel we've lost control. Like Henry, we do escape (usually in our minds and mostly to unpleasant periods in our lives). Also like Henry, we often gain insight from that mental wandering. Unlike Henry, however, most people don't have a Clare who has been there from the very beginning declaring from the rooftops that she'll be there until the very end.<br /><br />Niffenegger has written a masterpiece and I look forward to reading her next work of art.	2005-09-01

Sixty years earlier, following the path of Alma, the love of his life, Leo  fled war-torn Poland. He loses a book he authored called The History of Love in which the main female character is named Alma and he also loses Alma. Now, an elderly man in his eighties, Leo is alone and obsessed with his mortality. Feeling that his existence is inconsequential to the world around him, Leo refuses to be ignored and has developed some pretty creative ways albeit eccentric to declare that he is indeed still alive. <br /> <br />There are many twists and turns in this powerful story of survival of the human spirit. Seemingly disconnected subplots are brilliantly connected. The History of Love is not your typical page turner for every word in this beautifully written novel should be pondered, savored, and enjoyed. Kudos to Nicole Krauss.	2005-08-11

However, last year, I must admit I merely put up with The Lake House. I didn't love it but I easily forgave Patterson and understood his need to try something new.  <br /> <br />LIFEGUARD did not cut it with me.

I was not disappointed with Undead and Unappreciated. <br /> <br />I didn't read the previous novels in the Betsy Taylor series but I was still able to keep up with the life or should I say \\"unlife\\" of the ditzy progtagonist, Betsy the Vampire Queen.  <br /> <br />Oh, the perils of Betsy: she's running a night club and her vampire workers are on strike, she discovers she has a half sister (who's literally the devil's spawn) and sets out to find her, and she's hot for the King of the Vampires. <br /> <br />Nice formula. Witty and entertaining.	2005-08-11

Keri Whitmore, a single parent, is the owner of a successful upscale \\"second-hand\\" boutique.  Her teen-age daughter, Trina is not only beautiful, but smart-as-a-whip. She's been accepted to Brown University, but when she begins to exhibit signs of emotional instability and is hospitalized, she's unable to attend. Trina's bipolar diagnosis has derailed both her own as well as her mother's life.  <br /> <br />Clyde, Keri's ex-husband and Trina's father has always been there for Trina, however, he's in denial about her mental illness and believes Keri is being overly dramatic in her quest to seek treatment for their daughter. He refuses to believe there's anything wrong with his perfect daughter and assumes an advesarial role, thus Keri is forced to endure the emotional and physical abuse inflicted upon her by Trina alone. <br /> <br />When on medication, Trina is able to function. She's childlike and clearly not her usual self, but when she's not taking her meds, she's erratic, violent, and promiscuous among other awful behaviors. Keri wavers between being hopeful that Trina will go back to normal and being terrified that her child will go mad again. <br /> <br />Monitoring Trina is all-consuming and Keri's life is on hold. Embarrassed by Trina's diagnosis and behaviors, Keri has dropped her former friends--and has developed new relationships with people she's met in family group therapy sessions. <br /> <br />\\"I'm taking my meds\\" is Trina's mantra. However, this is rarely the case for very long and when she's not taking her meds, Trina is a danger to herself and others. <br /> <br />Throughout the ordeal, Keri compares her situation to slavery and this reader found these comparisons sad but wickedly humorous. <br /> <br />Bebe Moore Campbell has written a poignant and riveting story that I found hard to put down.	2005-08-08

Ellie thinks she has it all--a new husband with a close-knit family who embraces her, a baby on the way. Who could ask for more? It turns out that her mother-in-law is not the warm nurturing soul she pretended to be. In fact, after Ellie gives birth, mother-in-law has no more use for her and is downright rude in her exclusion of Ellie. <br /> <br />There were times when I wanted to shake Ellie for whining to her husband instead of standing up to \\"Mommy Dearest\\" herself.

But the pending union is fraught with complications. Her husband-to-be has an ex that won't go away and a daughter who could use some good old fashioned disciplining. Making matters worse, Sara's ex-husband is back on the scene and is determined to establish a relationship with their son--whom he'd never met. Hmmm. <br /> <br />Kate, a successful dermatologist is running around with a rich married man and is not only accepting of the role of mistress, but she's having a ball. For a while. <br /> <br />Berri, has traded her career for motherhood to twins and she's having a rough time of it being that her hormones are acting up and are all out of whack. <br /> <br />One would think that by middle-age, these women would have it together. But life doesn't work that way. Everything is cyclical and the same agonizing situations experienced during the teen years often return wearing a different disguise. <br /> <br />Using witty dialogue and comedic situations, the authors poke fun at serious life issues, urging the reader not to take life's ups and downs too seriously. Sometimes you just have to laugh at the never ending drama in your life. <br /> <br />Mine Are Spectacular is just that-- Spectacular!	2005-08-01

Although her attempts at getting a job are hilarious (she gets hired and fired as quick as lightening) it bothered me that she had actually gotten out of the bounty hunter business. Being a bounty hunter is her identity in this series; it's how I define her. So I gave a sigh of relief when she got hired by Ranger. However, her job description has changed from being in the field to desk duty. Meanwhile, her friend Lula moves up the ranks and acquires Stephanie's old job. But Lula can't seem to catch any crooks and when she calls on Stephanie to lend a hand, Stephanie ends up back in the trenches, hunting down scum bags who jump bail. <br /> <br />Eleven On Top is mostly a fun read, with all the quirky family members adding to the humor. But there are some annoying spots, such as the disrespectful way Stephanie treats Joe and the way she lusts after Ranger. We'll have to wait for book twelve to find out if she's going to put Joe out of his misery so she can get with the guy she really wants--Ranger. <br /> <br />	2005-07-31

One fateful night while in college, he tries to break up a brawl between students. A kid is left dead and everyone flees the scene except Matt. He's a stand-up guy, but unfortunately, his sense of honor and decency make him a handy target. He's convicted of murder and serves time in prison.<br /><br />He somehow survives prison life and once released he's given a new lease on life when his older attorney brother gets him a job as a paralegal at the law firm where he works. Matt meets and marries Olivia who discovers she's pregnant and life couldn't be better.<br /><br />But this is a Harlan Coben novel, so the reader is braced for bad things to start happening. As expected, at the height of Matt's happiness, his world begins to slowly and horribly collapse, causing the reader to join him and his wife as they try to salvage their lives while dodging bullets.<br /><br />The Innocent is an edge-of-your seat read that will keep you turning pages in the wee hours of the night.	2005-07-31

Mind you, in this glitzy tale, there are many sparkling characters. Against her father's wishes, Siena wants to follow in granddaddy Duke's footsteps and finds herself disinherited. Not to worry. She's a clever girl and beautiful to boot. Although stardom is not handed to her on a silver platter, it's pretty clear that Siena will get what she's after. <br /> <br />The book transports the reader behind the scenes of the entertainment industry, with a heavy dose of gossip that entices one to try to figure out which real-life stars are being portrayed in this fictionalized version of lifestyles of the rich and the famous.  <br /> <br />In her stellar debut novel, Tilly Bagshawe puts a different spin on a story I'm certain has been told a zillion times.

However, the plus side to that literary lapse in judgment is that I wasn't familiar with the characters in Something Blue and therefore had no reason to feel disappointed that the book was written from the point of view of bad girl Darcy.  <br /> <br />Quite frankly, I enjoyed Darcy's spunk and respected her decision to make peace with being a self-involved and shallow human being. Darcy's innumerable dastardly deeds kept me turning pages. But when she ends up pregnant and rejected by the father of the child as well as her former friends, Darcy has to hatch a new plan if she expects to continue to live the fabulous life. After licking her wounds, she high-tails it out of New York and is off to London to live with Ethan, a childhood friend who had the audacity to give her the brush off back in grade school. Gracing him with her indefinite presence in his apartment should give Ethan ample time to correct the error of his ways. <br /> <br />But Ethan isn't the push-over Darcy had expected him to be and he has no patience for her narcissistic tendencies. With Ethan's insistance that Darcy view life from a more mature perspective, she's forced to mend her ways as she prepares for motherhood. <br /> <br />This is one of the best chic lit books I've ever read. I plan to back track and pick up Something Borrowed ASAP.	2005-07-29

While most of us (real-life,unfictional characters) would ferverently pray for a miracle while trying  to put up a brave front,we'd ultimately have to walk the proverbial plank, face the unmelodic music, and wait for the ax to fall. Samanatha, however, did what we'd all like to do under similar circumstances... RUN! HEAD FOR THE HILLS! And that's the part that made the story unrealistic, but oh so funny.

Most likely, a parent would experience a myriad of emotions: fear, hurt, and anger. In My Sister's Keeper, the parents find hope in the knowledge that they can conceive a donor match for their terminally ill daughter, Kate. <br /> <br />Initially, it seemed the perfect solution. What parent wouldn't do whatever it takes to save their child's life? From the beginning of her life, Anna's (Kate's sibling and lifeline) sole purpose for existing is to keep Kate alive. Hearing Anna's perspective, I started to feel that the endless medical probing and prodding that she'd endured from birth was downright abusive. But on the other hand, I've never had to make such a decision so I tried to keep an open mind. <br />  <br />When Anna turns thirteen, she's expected to donate a kidney to her sister, an operation that is a great risk to both sisters. Anna rebels and gets an attorney. She wants to be medically emancipated from giving blood, bone marrow, and undergoing numerous surgeries.   <br /> <br />As the novel reached its conclusion, I had mixed emotions about practically everything in the book except my feelings regarding Sara, the mother of Kate, Anna, and older brother, Jesse. Sara seemed incapable of nurturing Anna and Jesse. Whenever Kate had a medical emergency, Sara became intolerant toward her other two children. Anna and Jesse's needs were not just an inconvenient annoyance (which is bad enough) but their needs were pereceived by Sara as \\"obscene.\\" Whew! That's pretty harsh. <br /> <br />Jodi Picoult took me on an emotional journey that I was completely unprepared for. And just when I thought I had come to a decision regarding my own view point regarding this sensitive subject matter, she left me speechless with something new to ponder.	2005-07-28

But anyhoo, here's my take on THE STARTER WIFE: <br /> <br />Gracie Pollock receives the absolutely horrendous news that her husband is leaving her for another woman. Her husband delivers this cruel revelation  over a cell phone. This untimely bomb is dropped just before he and Gracie's prenup agreement would have become invalid. How crude. I wanted to kick the cad myself. <br /> <br />Don't worry, in this fairy tale-type world, poor Gracie and four-year old child don't have to start heading for the \\"poor house.\\" They become housesitters for one of Gracie's benevolent rich friends and get to dwell in a fabulous abode--the type of  atmosphere suitable to her tastes. At least for a while. And during this time of introspection, Gracie realizes she needs to quickly snatch up another man of means. Problem is she has two choices, a charming nere-do-well or the rich (not so charming) friend of a friend. What's a poor girl to do? <br /> <br />There's lots of clever dialogue, waaaay too much name dropping. And then there's Gracie's obsession with growing older, which I found realistic. After all, at 41 years old, by Hollywood standards, Gracie's practically ready to be carted off to the glue factory. <br /> <br />All in all, I enjoyed this fun and fluffy read and may check out the previous two novels by this author.	2005-07-28

I must admit that I don't usually read historical fiction, but I kept either seeing and hearing about this book. Of course I had some general knowledge of King Henry VIII (and all the wife-killing) and I had a very vague sense of his second wife Anne Boleyn, but never would I have expected to become totally involved with characters from that time period. The main characters were so vivid and their personalities were so familiar, the novel could have easily taken place today. <br /> <br />The Boleyn siblings (Anne, Mary, and George) are brought to the king's court at an early age to help fatten the family purse. Mary, in her early teens, is encouraged to cozy up to the married king. She bears the king two children--a daughter and a son. One would think having a son would please a king--but sadly an illegitimate son cannot be heir to the throne. <br /> <br />While Mary's been handling the bedroom duties for the king, her sister, Anne has been plotting on her position. Cunning Anne not only finangles her way into Mary's spot, but using her superior feminine wiles, she also manages to overthrow the reigning queen. <br /> <br />Brother George \\"looses his head\\" over another man. <br /> <br />When Anne, now Queen Anne, can't deliver an heir to the throne...well, it's off with her head.  <br /> <br />Mary's story ends well, but with all that family dysfunction and mayhem going on in the castle (heads rolling at the king's whim) it's a miracle Mary was able to leave the castle physically and emotionally unscathed.  <br /> <br />This was a great historical read with some unexpected steamy sex, which added more spice to an already spicey tale.  <br />	2005-07-28

He uses a co-author in this fast-paced story of a female killer--a black widow. I prefer that he write alone (and if I had my druthers, he'd stick to Alex Cross and The Women's Murder club series) but I guess he needs a little support in churning out the vast number of books he has sitting on the book store shelves.

Thus, to find out how everything ties together, the reader has to buy the sequel.   <br /> <br />All in all, it was a pretty good read.	2005-07-12
