I picked up this book after hearing that it would soon be adapted into a film starring Aishwarya Rai (as Tilo) and Dylan McDermott (as Doug aka Raven).  <br /> <br />Having recently 'discovered' India and Ms. Rai in the delicious film \\"Bride and Prejudice\\" and having just returned from a trip to San Francisco, I became intrigued by the plot of this book: an immortal Indian woman, Tilo, has the power to manipulate spices in order to help others. She keeps a shop in Oakland, CA, and administers the spices to those who ask for help. She is faced with a dilemma, however, when she meets the mysterious American, Raven...should she stay true to her purpose and remain immortal or give up everything for the man she loves? <br /> <br />More than just a story of choices, sacrifice and love, several wonderful characters also populate this novel:  <br />- Haroun, the taxi driver who dreams of 'making it' big in America;  <br />- Geeta, the young woman who faces opposition and estrangement from her family when she falls in love with wrong man;  <br />- Geeta's grandfather, who at first opposes Geeta but later relents and tries to rebuild the relationships within his family;  <br />- Lalita who is trapped in a loveless marriage with her brute of a husband;  <br />- Jagjit, a promising young man who makes friends with the 'wrong crowd;' <br />- Hameeda, a single mother who secretly yearns for love; <br /> <br />..and, of course, there is Tilo - a young woman trapped in the body of an elderly woman who has the power to help those around her. Her fate becomes entwined with Raven, a young man with a secret past and who is the only person who sees Tilo for what she really is. <br /> <br />I breezed through this book and could hardly put it down. By the end I wished it would go on and on. Though the story does have a conclusion (and doesn't leave you hanging like other books), I just wanted Tilo's story to continue. Finishing it was like saying goodbye to an old friend. I applaud Ms. Divakaruni for creating such memorable and endearing characters and for effortlessly weaving fantasy and reality in one entertaining story.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to romantics everywhere and I'm looking forward to seeing the finished film. I am optimistic that the talented Aishwarya Rai and Dylan McDermott will do justice to Ms. Divakaruni's fabulous prose.	2005-04-23
US	52342342	R9YHCR2CCYGJ7	0966800508	639898632	The Weaver Takes a Wife	Books	5	7	7	N	N	An enchanting read!	I came across this book at my local library. Being a fan of books from the Regency and Victorian era - Jane Austen, Fanny Burney and Elizabeth Gaskell in particular - I loaned this book without any expectations.  <br /> <br />\\"The Weaver Takes a Wife\\" turned out to be a quick and enjoyable read. The literary world is littered with 'wannabe' regency authors who try too hard and often fall short. Many Jane Austen 'sequels', for instance, are disappointing and don't even come close to living up to the original. However, I found Sherri Cobb South to be a very effective author who has an excellent command of the language and customs of the period she is writing about.   <br /> <br />Mr. Ethan Brundy and Lady Helen Radney are interesting and believable characters and I was easily drawn into their world.  Their love story is unusual in that instead of the young lady doing everything in her power to attract the man, the tables are turned in that the young lady is repulsed by the man and he must do what he can to win her heart.  This man succeeds not because of his good looks, wit or money but because of his innate humility, patience and goodness. <br /> <br />I wish Sherri Cobb South would try her hand at writing Jane Austen sequels!  She has such a light, witty and clever style of writing that I have no doubt she would do justice to Ms. Austen's works. \\"The Weaver Takes a Wife\\" is an original work and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys Jane Austen-type stories and/or good regency/victorian romances.	2005-01-21

This is a great must-have for those who are planning to take their kids on a trip to England. Whether this is your first time or a repeat visit, this book is invaluable. <br /> <br />This excellent Cadogan Guidebook has chock full of up-to-date information on family-friendly sites.  This includes attraction descriptions, costs, hours of operation and tips on how to get there. There are also tips on whether sites have special amenities for babies/toddlers.  Each section (chapter) is divided according to geographic location - London, the southwest, south, Thames Valley, etc.  The authors also rate their favorite or highly recommended spots.  As a frequent visitor to the UK, I marvel at how much ground they cover.  Everything from gardens, historic buildings, palaces, castles, zoos, parks, amusement centers, beaches, kid-friendly restaurants and shopping areas are covered in great detail. <br /> <br />My only complaint with this book is that it is almost completely text - no pictures and few maps.  However, the book itself is almost 2 inches thick which really does show how much ground this book covers.    <br /> <br />This book is an excellent resource for what to see and do on your upcoming trip. If you're into visuals, then I recommend that you get this book and the Eyewitness Great Britain guide.  If you're planning to spend most of your time in London and only a couple of days in the countryside, then pick up the London version of this book instead.  However, if you're planning to spend a lot of time trekking around London and the English countryside, this and the Eyewitness Guide combined should put you on your way to planning and enjoying a fun-filled family trip to England.	2004-11-06

My little girl loves Strawberry Shortcake and we purchase just about every SS book that comes out. This book is one of her favorites. First of all, it introduces a new character to the Strawberryland universe - pretty brunette Blueberry Muffin. <br /> <br />Blueberry Muffin is new to the neighborhood and the kids are happy to welcome her, except for Ginger Snap. Ginger feels left out and becomes jealous when her friends pay more attention to Blueberry. With the help of Strawberry Shortcake and their friends, Ginger Snap begins to realize that having new friends doesn't mean you have to give up your old friends. <br /> <br />This is a nice story about friendship - creating new ones and keeping old ones.

I lived in London for 3  years and have visited Europe several times in the past decade and Rick Steves' books are always the first travel guides that I turn to in my travel planning.  If cost and time are a factor to you in your travels then Rick Steves' guides will prove indispensable. <br /> <br />I took his books with me on my travels to Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, France and Great Britain as well as on my return trips to these countries.  His tips on what to see and what to skip have proved invaluable.  Thanks to him, I discovered this lovely little day trip outfit called \\"Mad Max Tours\\" which my husband and I joined during a recent trip to Bath, England.  His tips on what is worth seeing in the British Museum and National Gallery saved us from `museum overload' on our subsequent trips to these fabulous and immense museums.  I used to walk mindlessly along the numerous rooms and exhibits in these museums, until, 3 hours later, I walk out like a zombie overwhelmed with what I saw. <br /> <br />I highly recommend Rick's city guide to London. This guide is budget-minded, time-conscious and makes a point of touching on every major sight in these cities.  It also includes walking tours, museum guides, shopping, accommodations, maps, recommended day trips and even kid-friendly attractions/activities. All of his guides include costs, location, subway/train stops, hours and descriptions (and his straightforward opinions) on each place.   <br /> <br />Shortcomings? Well, trust me, no travel guide is perfect.  Eyewitness, for instance, has wonderful colored pictures and loads of visuals but little practical information.  Fodors and Frommers have too much text and almost no pictures.  As for Rick, I used to gripe about his sparse selection of hotels in certain cities but he has now improved on these.  And as much as I love his books, I also do agree that if this is your first trip to the United Kingdom, then do yourself a favor and check out at least one other travel guide as well.  For instance, \\"Take the Kids: London\\" or Fodors' \\"Around London With Kids\\"  are great supplementary guides for those with families.  Frommers or Fodors guides are always worth the look for their comprehensive coverage. And if you're into visuals, then the Eyewitness Guides are a must have.  After all, Rick's guides are selective and - depending on your tastes and preferences - you might miss some activities or sights that are also well worth a look.  If antique shopping is your thing, for instance, then you would sadly miss out on the fabulous Bermondsey antique market in London which Rick doesn't mention in his books.  Or, that you might choose do ignore a daytrip to the lovely towns of Oxford or Brighton which Rick also doesn't mention. As much as Rick loves Cambridge, I insist that Oxford also has its many (unique) charms. And Brighton is a fabulous destination for families and beach/seaside loving travelers. <br /> <br />In short, Rick Steves' books are an indispensable and invaluable guide for budget-minded travelers everywhere.  His books are selective and well worth your time and money.  However, I do recommend that you don't limit yourself to only one travel guide as your  <br />Planning/travel companion.  Get Rick's book but also check out one more of the travel guides I list above for good measure.   <br /> <br />   <br />	2004-10-14
US	52342342	R6RQ6M8P11T7T	1589395972	237559353	Conviction: A Sequel to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice	Books	3	137	146	N	N	Sometimes interesting but at times incredibly dull.....	I had high hopes for \\"Conviction\\" after having read the earlier reviews of this book.  I love Jane Austen's novels and make every effort to read whatever 'sequel' it is that I could get my hands on. <br /> <br />\\"Conviction\\" heads off to a promising start. We are re-introduced to Georgiana Darcy, Mr. and Mrs. Darcy, Mr. and Mrs.  Bingley, Caroline Bingley and Kitty Bennet.  The story begins with Georgiana and her life after the marriage of her brother Fitzwilliam to Elizabeth Bennet.  We are introduced to her many suitors including the odious Mr. Davidson and the promising Major Talbot and Jacob Markwood.  Georgiana makes her choice early on the the story but starts having second thoughts when her bethroned leaves Derbyshire for Brighton and she gradually falls in love with someone else. <br /> <br />The story and the new characters are, for the most part, interesting.  Unfortunately, shortly after the introduction of Jacob Markwood (a vicar), the reader becomes encumbered by the author's decision to let her characters carry on about their 'religious calling' or abolitionist beliefs.  These 'rantings' sadly weigh the story down and are incredibly dull and boring.  It zaps the life out of the story! Jane Austen was obviously smart enough to avoid this mistake with her characters - even with clergymen like Mr. Collins and Edward Bertram. <br /> <br />Another shortcoming is in the author's use of language throughout the book. At times I wonder if Ms. Burris had done any research on the customs and traditions of the Regency Period. For example, the book is peppered with terms such as \\"girlish crush\\" and other modern slang. The British (then and now) do not use the word \\"crush.\\" It would have been more appropriate to use the term \\"girlish fancy\\" instead.  Also, anyone familiar with Jane Austen's work would know that only vulgar women (like \\"Emma's\\" Mrs. Elton) would address a man without using \\"Mr.\\" As such, a well-educated and accomplished young lady like Georgiana would never call her older brother \\"Darcy.\\"  Likewise, a vicar would never call Mr. Darcy (his employer and one who is far above him in station) \\"Darcy.\\"   <br /> <br />Fans of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" may be disappointed because characters like Jane and Charles Bingley, Elizabeth and Caroline Bingley are barely in the book.  They make 'cameo' appearances  but are almost completely absent for most of the story. Early on it becomes clear that Georgiana and one of her specific suitors are the center of the story. <br /> <br />In short, I truly wanted to like \\"Conviction.\\"  There were moments when I liked it but the dullness and predictability sometimes outweighed the good.  The tone is solemn and it lacks the humor and wit of Jane Austen's works.  The plot is rather thin and the resolution regarding Kitty's romantic potential was quickly patched up.  The author leads the reader to believe that a specific suitor is interested in Kitty, then at the last minute he changes his mind and she ends up with someone else (and a character who is barely mentioned in the book)!!  <br /> <br />I much preferred Julia Barrett's sequel centering on Georgiana called \\"Presumption.\\" It is a more coherent, interesting and better written book.  \\"Conviction\\" is, unfortunately, one of the many mediocre sequels to Jane Austen's works.  It had the potential and I truly wish that it had been better.	2004-08-15

There are not a lot of books out there on VA Beach or the Hampton Roads. Believe me, I've looked. Most travel guides concentrate on the state of Virginia as a whole and information on the Hampton Roads area is pretty sparse.<br />This is why I am thankful for this book.  &quot;The Insider's Guide to Virginia Beach&quot; is actually much more than just a travel guide to Virginia Beach.  It covers the entire Hampton Roads region including the cities of Norfolk, Chesapeake, Suffolk and Portsmouth as well as the Chesapeake Bay.  Topics covered include the area's overview and history, restaurants, accommodations, shopping, attractions (including kid-friendly activities), recreation, daytrips, real estate and neighborhoods, schools, healthcare and more. At over 300 pages, it is packed with useful information that you just won't find in your standard Virginia travel book.<br />I highly recommend this book to travelers who want to concentrate on the Hampton Roads/Virginia Beach area or those who are planning to relocate there.  I've shopped around for books on Virginia Beach and this really is your best bet.  If you are interested in visiting several areas in Virginia, then I would also recommend the &quot;Moon Handbooks: Virginia&quot; or &quot;The Virginia Handbook.&quot; However, if you plan to spend most of your time in the Virginia Beach area, then this book is a must have.	2004-07-11

I love the film &quot;Underworld&quot; and bought this book hoping to get more background information on the characters. The film warrants a sequel (and filming on &quot;Underworld 2&quot; starts Fall 2004) and even after several viewings of the dvd I always found new facts and tidbits that I hadn't caught before.<br />This is where the book comes in handy. Greg Cox does a fantastic job not only of bringing the film to life with his vivid descriptions, but he also does a great job of telling you what the characters are thinking and feeling. There is also more background info on the characters and the vampire and lycan culture that is not obvious or even mentioned in the film.  For instance, I didn't realize that the vampire culture has a certain hierarchy and that the character Erika is considered a mere servant. Kraven and Lucian's plans are also explained here while only alluded to in the film. Many of my questions were answered in this book and this is why I find this an indispensable companion to the movie/dvd.<br />If you are an &quot;Underworld&quot; fan, then this book is a must have. It is a quick and enjoyable read that will give you new insight on the characters and cultures of the movie.	2004-06-24

Like most books in the &quot;Idiot's Guide&quot; series, this guide to classical mythology is an excellent and comprehensive resource book for fans of Greek and Roman mythology.<br />There are several mythology reference books available in the market today but more serious and 'seasoned' fans and scholars will likely prefer THE COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO CLASSICAL MYTHOLOGY by Kevin Osborn.  We're not idiots, of course, but this book is meaty, entertaining and has more background information on the various gods/goddesses, heroes and stories. At over 350 pages, it has loads of information on various topics and stories in mythology.  For instance, an entire chapter is dedicated to the Trojan War and Achilles and Odysseus also have their own chapters. With other mythology books, you would be lucky to have a few pages dedicated to Achilles alone.<br />Fans who want more than classical mythology will want to explore MYTHOLOGY FOR DUMMIES by Christopher Blackwell.  This book also delves into the Arthurian legend, Norse myths, Beowulf, as well as world mythology in general (Chinese, Jewish, Hindu, etc).<br />These 2 books are all excellent. The choice lies on the readers' level of interests.  I would recommend the &quot;Complete Idiot's Guide&quot; to those who enjoy Roman and Greek mythology or those who want to learn more about the Trojan War, Perseus, Jason and the Argonauts, Zeus, Hercules and the many other fascinating gods/goddesses and heroes of classical mythology.	2004-05-24

At over 300 pages, it does a good job of covering the various myths around the world.<br />However, those who are interested mainly in classical mythology (e.g. Jupiter/Zeus, Juno/Hera, the Trojan War, Odysseus, Perseus, Hercules) will likely prefer THE COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO CLASSICAL MYTHOLOGY by Kevin Osborn.  This book gets more into the history and backgrounds of the Greek and Roman gods/goddesses and heroes/heroines.  For instance, an entire chapter is devoted to the Trojan War hero Achilles while the &quot;Dummies&quot; book only has a few paragraphs, at the most.<br />We're not idiots or dummies, of course, and these books are excellent reference guides to the world of mythology.  At over 350 pages, both books are meaty and informative, interesting and engrossing.  Your choice as a reader solely depends on where your interests lie.  <br />I would recommend the &quot;Dummies&quot; book to those who are interested in world mythology and the &quot;Idiot's Guide&quot; to those who strictly want Greek and Roman mythology.  I would also recommend Edith Hamilton's various mythology books.  Her books actually give a &quot;cliff's notes&quot; version of the various stories and tales - ranging from the Arthurian legends, to the Trojan War, to the Aeneid and beyond.	2004-05-03

This is - bar none - the best \\"The Return of the King\\" movie tie-in book in the market right now.  The others being  \\"The Return of the King Photo Guide\\" and \\"The Return of the King Visual Companion.,\\" that is.   Along with Brian Sibley's \\"The Making of the Movie Trilogy\\" (released in 2002) and the \\"Art of\\" series, this is one of those books that you will want to keep and refer to again and again.  It is one of the most amazingly detailed, visually rich and impressively researched books on the LOTR movie trilogy that you will likely come across.<br />I am a huge fan of \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"  \\"Huge\\" in the sense that I have read the books multiple times in the last several years, own the theatrical and extended versions of the films,  and have read Tolkien's other books - including \\"The Silmarillion\\" and \\"The Unfinished Tales.\\"  You may say I am more than your standard fan and that it takes a lot to impress me.  This book, however, impressed me.  What is commendable about this book is the amount of information it contains and the painstaking research that author Chris Smith has done to bring this book about.  He clearly has done his homework and not only researched \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" books but also collaborated closely with WETA (the special/visual effects wizards behind the movie trilogy), director Peter Jackson and crew.  There are references to \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"The Unfinished Tales,\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" (including the appendices) sprinkled throughout this book.  That, to me, is remarkable.<br />This fantastic book covers all of the notable warriors (good and bad), battles and skirmishes that took place throughout the trilogy as well as the respective armor, weapons, cultures, fighting styles and (where applicable) battle plans/strategies that we see in the films.  For the warriors, everyone from Aragorn, Boromir, Isildur, Theoden, Eomer, Denethor, Gandalf, Legolas, the hobbits and Gimli to the Easterlings, the Corsairs of Umbar, the Haradrim,Sauron, the Army of the Dead (yes!) and the various types of Orcs and Uruk-hai are featured in this book.  Their weapons and armor (weapon descriptions, names, pictures/drawings, and inscriptions, etc) are described in detail.  For instance, differences between the various orcs (berserker uruk-hai, Mordor orc, Moria orc, etc) and their specific roles and functions are shown.  The Rohirric and Gondorian cultures are explored - their emblems, flags, origins, weaponry, etc.  There is a battle plan for the Battle of the Second Age, Helms Deep and The Battle of Pelennor Fields also in this book.  Even the skirmish in the Mines of Moria is included.<br />In summary, even the most discerning Lord of the Rings fan will enjoy this book.  If you think you know everything about the books or films, there are bound to be a few facts or images in this book that will surprise you.  At 224 pages, this is a hefty book and each page is loaded with information.  It is not all text, however.  There are hundreds of beautiful illustrations and full-color pictures that really are a feast for those who are big on visuals.  I highly recommend it!	2003-11-06

I love it!!<br />I spend a lot (and I mean, A LOT) of time planning my vacations.  My planning includes scouring the web, reading tons of books and watching travel shows months ahead of my travel date.  I've browsed through many Disney World related books in my local bookstore but the Passporter is the one that impressed me the most.<br />If you are planning a vacation to Disney World, and particularly if you intend to spend most of your trip in the WDW property, I HIGHLY recommend this book.  It is packed with information on the hotels, restaurants, theme parks, special activities as well as travel tips and planning info for your trip. At least 3 pages are dedicated to each Disney resort and even more pages on each theme park (along with some great maps).  There is also a great rating system for each resort, theme park attraction and restaurant/eatery. My favorite feature (which I have not seen in other travel books) are the maps of each hotel resort which even shows where the pools, eateries, play areas and transportation location.<br />I initially bought 2 other Disney-related travel books but returned those and kept just this one.  Unless you're planning to spend a lot of time outside the Disney property, this really is the only book you will need. And for those who will be dividing their time between Disney and other Orlando theme parks, be sure to get this book and check out one of the following: &quot;The Unofficial Guide to Florida with Kids&quot; by Pam Brandon (if traveling with children) or &quot;The Everything Travel Guide to Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and Greater Orlando&quot; by Jason Rich.

I purchased this book while planning my family trip to Orlando.  I found it to be extremely helpful and is one of the few books available that covers Walt Disney World, Orlando and Seaworld at the same time.  This book is ideal for first time visitors to the Orlando area, repeat visitors who have not been to Orlando in awhile and/or those who want to do a good bit of planning before their trip.  <br />When my family first started planning our trip, we knew that there was no way for us to be able to see everything we wanted to in this visit.  We wanted to make the most of our travel dollars and visit only places that the whole family can enjoy.  This book was extremely useful in giving us information on accommodations, restaurants, parks and their must-see attractions.  For each ride/attraction/show within the major theme parks, for instance, the author provides a star rating system based on the individual's age (e.g. 2-4 years, 5-10 years, and so on, including  Senior Citizens) as well as information on the attraction itself.  There are also \\"Helpful Hints\\" sprinkled throughout the book as well as \\"Travel Tips,\\" \\"Hot Spots\\" and \\"Fast Facts.\\"  I found this extremely useful in helping us determine which theme parks would provide the optimum enjoyment for our family.<br />To give you an idea of how much this book covers, I have listed the chapters below:<br />1. Preparing for your Vacation<BR>2. Choosing your Accommodations<BR>3. Admission to the Disney Theme Parks<BR>4. Orlando-Area Dining<br />5. Introduction to the Magic Kingdom<BR>6. Exploring the Magic Kingdom<BR>7. Kid-Oriented Areas of the Magic Kingdom<BR>8. All About Epcot<BR>9. The Disney-MGM Studios<BR>10. Disney's Animal Kingdom<BR>11. Disney's Water Parks<BR>12. Disney Nightlife<BR>13. A High Seas Adventure (Disney Cruise Lines)<BR>14. The Universal Orlando Resort<BR>15. The Universal Studios Florida Theme Park<BR>16. Universal Escape's Islands of Adventure<BR>17. Universal City Walk<BR>18. SeaWorld and Discovery Cove<BR>19. Exploring Greater Orlando<BR>20. Planning Your Trip<br />In addition to this extensive list are maps, important phone numbers, an attraction selection worksheet and daily itinerary.  In short, I would have to say that this book gives a lot of bang for the buck.  It would recommend it to those with families who are planning to visit the Orlando area and plan to enjoy Walt Disney World as well as the other non-Disney theme parks.	2003-07-04

Don't be fooled by the back cover that states \\"the official children's photo guide to The Two Towers.\\"  This great book is full of amazing photos from the upcoming Lord of the Rings film to delight fans of all ages!<br />The book itself is set up in a narrative style, which goes through the general movie plot with accompanying pictures.  For instance, in the part where Merry and Pippin encounter the Ents, we are treated with a full-page picture of Treebeard (in all his glory!) holding Merry and Pippin.<br />The book has pictures of all the major (and minor) characters and locations in the film, including Theoden, Gollum, Faramir, Aragorn, Legolas, Frodo, Gandalf the White, the Warg Riders and Easterlings, as well as Osgiliath, Ithilien, Edoras, Helms Deep and Fangorn Forest.  <br />One word of caution, however:  This book goes through the general plot of the movie and also reveals where changes were made from the book.  So if you want SPOILERS, this is the book for you! However, if you want to remain spoiler-free (at least until the film arrives), then quickly browse through the book but do not read it!<br />Of the 4 movie tie-in books that were recently released (The Two Towers Visual Companion, Two Towers Creature Guide and The Making of the Movie Trilogy), this is the BEST in terms of Two Towers-related pictures.  The Visual Companion comes a close second.  If you want behind the scenes info, then pick up The Making of the Movie Trilogy as well.  The books go hand-in-hand with very little overlap in terms of content.	2002-11-07

What an incredible book!  At 192 pages, this fantastic work by Gary Russell is chock-full of pictures, sketches, drawings and paintings from the wonderful film The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Rings.  I have purchased all of the movie tie-in books available and this is by far my favorite.  If you are into visuals (and I am), I couldnt recommend this book enough.  The back of the book says contains 500 exclusive paintings and drawings from the spectacular film\\" and they weren't kidding!<br />The book is divided into 4 chapters - Locations, Costumes, Armory and Creatures.  The LOCATIONS chapter is by far the largest - with extensive coverage of Bag End and Hobbiton, Bree, Weathertop, Ford of Bruinen, Rivendell, Moria, Isengard, Lothlorien, the River Anduin, Mordor and Amon Hen.  One of my favorites is the sketch of the Bag End floor plan (with its pantries and cellars that we dont get to see in the film).  There are also sketches of the interior of the Green Dragon Inn (which we never saw on the film but which will hopefully make an appearance on the Special Extended Edition VHS/DVD to be released in November).  The COSTUMES chapter shows the various design sketches by Ngila Dickson and Sylvana Sacco.  All the main characters (from Frodo to Galadriel to Sauron - as well Gandalfs pipes!) are featured.  Costume designer Ngila Dickson also gives snippets on the influences of the costumes as well as the reasons why certain design themes were chosen (e.g. Boromirs Gondorian costume is drawn from Byzantine influences  and how Legolas costume  was the most difficult to design).  The ARMORY section shows all the various swords, daggers, insignias, shields, etc. carried by the characters.  Included are Frodos mithril shirt and the various armor as worn by Elendil, Elrond and GilGalad in the Prologue.  The final chapter, and not the least interesting, is the CREATURES section with its sketches, maquettes, paintings and screenshots of Orcs, Urukhai, the Cave Troll, the Ringwraiths, the Watcher of the Water and the spectacular Balrog.  One of the most interesting are the various versions of the Balrog (from more human-like to reptilian to the final version with wings).<br />Whats wonderful about this book is that it really gives you the essence of the monumental task of bringing the films to life.  So many talented individuals collaborated to breath life into  Professor Tolkiens Middle Earth.  Mind you, this book isnt all visuals:  each picture is accompanied by the description of the picture, the artist and background information on the picture (e.g. how it was used in the film, why it was rejected, Peter Jacksons ideas).  For instance, on his sketch of the Balrog, John Howe describes why he chose to give the Balrog wings (and Peter Jacksons response to it).  Alan Lee's beautiful paintings and drawings are also showcased in this book.<br />If you are a fan of the books and/or the film, are interested in art, or enjoy books with lots (and I mean loads) of wonderful visuals, then I couldnt recommend this book highly enough.  Im already looking forward to The Art of  The Two Towers and cant wait to see what Gary Russell has in store for us in the next couple of years!	2002-05-31
US	52342342	R1CPDQZKDLVOFC	0618154035	545294814	The Lord of the Rings Official Movie Guide	Books	5	15	15	N	Y	An absolute treat for Lord of the Rings fans!!	As a long time fan of Tolkien's magnificent novel and as one highly anticipating the upcoming Peter Jackson trilogy, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book.  And, I would have to say, I was not disappointed!  This amazing book offers an extensive and informative background to the making of the trilogy - with specific emphasis on the first film, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\" <br />Brian Sibley's book has 120 glossy pages and includes beautiful colored pictures that gives us behind-the-scenes glimpses as well as shots from the film itself.  The many topics covered include:  \\"From Book to Script\\" which covers the process of adapting the complex novel into a series of 3 films; \\"Speaking the Languages of Middle Earth\\" - incorporating Tolkien's different languages in the film; \\"From the Director's Chair\\" - Peter Jackson's perspective; \\"The One Ring\\" and \\"Of Wizard Beards and Elf Ears\\" - a look at the props and costumes; \\"A Workshop of the Fantastic\\" - WETA's special effects role; \\"Seeing Tolkien`s World\\" and \\"Fantasy to Reality\\" - artists Alan Lee and John Howe's significant contributions to the film visuals, characters and sets as well as the role of the art department; and, most significantly, \\"The Fellowship, Friends and Foes\\" - casting info and an introduction to the principal actors of the first film. <br />I do have to point out that Tolkien's notable creatures - such as the Balrog and Gollum - are not shown anywhere in the book.  I'm sure they were purposely (understandably) omitted to preserve the element of surprise for the first film.  It also appears that this book may just be the first of a series by Brian Sibley, primarily since it only covers topics relevant to the first film (for instance, pictures of Bernard Hill who plays \\"Theoden,\\" Miranda Otto who plays \\"Eowyn\\" and other actors and locations from the 2nd and 3rd books are absent in this book).  Though it is not explicitly mentioned, I would have to assume that there will be similar movie guides released in 2002 and 2003.<br />These points noted, I have to stress that this is a thoroughly enjoyable and informative book and I could not recommend it highly enough.  This is a book that any Lord of the Rings or film fan should be without!	2001-11-06

The item featured here is actually the Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring 2001-2002 Student Planner (Amazon title is incorrect but the ISBN matches).  This is a student planner that covers the period of August 2001 to September 2002 and uses high quality, glossy paper.  It is spiral-bound with a picture of the ring and red lightning-like flashes on the cover.<br />I am not a student but when I saw this student planner at a local bookstore I knew I had to have it. As a long time Tolkien and Lord of the Rings fan (and one who is very excited about the upcoming Peter Jackson film adaptation - and who isnt?), this is a must have.  This is the first LOTR film related merchandise to hit the shelves - the 2002 calendar and toys wont make their appearance until September - and it gives a fan like me a chance to finally get my hands on pictures (some not previously seen) from the upcoming film. One of my favorites is a photo of Aragorn kneeling in front of Frodo, hands on his chest and faithful sword Anduril on his side (perhaps a scene from Amon Hen?).  The picture is so clear that you can even see a small hole on Aragorns boots.  Another favorite is a photo of Frodo holding up the sword Sting to Bilbo in Rivendell (likely the scene where Bilbo gives Sting and the mithril mail to Frodo before he and the Fellowship leave for their quest). Gandalf, Saruman, Frodo, Gimli, Bilbo, Aragorn, the Orks, the Uruk Hai, Arwen and Galadriel have at least 2 pictures each.  Elrond, Pippin, Legolas, Boromir, cave trolls and some other menacing characters are also featured (though, surprisingly, none of Merry!). These are actual photos from the upcoming film and did I mention that you get 38 full page (8x5)photos in vivid color!    The rest of the student planner - for you legitimate students - features monthly calendars (the planner itself is weekly), a grade keeper, a list of  cool and useful web sites, weights and measures, conversions,  address and phone number list, birthdays and special occasions list and many more!!  <br />I highly recommend this item for any fan of LOTR or anyone who has even the slightest interest in the upcoming film trilogy!!	2001-08-04

I am a cynic when it comes to sequels or &quot;continuations&quot; of Jane Austens works but I found this version of &quot;Sanditon&quot; delightful!  &quot;Another Lady&quot; has done a superb job of continuing Ms. Austen's unfinished work and the language, characterization and plot line stay faithful to the original. <br />The story centers on Charlotte Heywood, a pretty country girl who is brought by Mr. and Mrs. Parker to their seaside town of Sanditon. Here she meets a wide variety of characters - from the noble but arrogant Lady Denham and her ward Clara Brereton; handsome and voluble Sir Edward Denham and his snobbish sister Esther; the heiress Ms. Lambe; the fashionable but superficial Beaufort sisters; and Mr. Parker's siblings Susan, Diana, Sidney and Arthur.  The handsome and charming Sidney also brings with him 2 equally eligible young men, Mr. Henry Brudenall and Mr. Reginald Caton (all but these 2 characters were Jane Austen's creations).  <br />Charlotte becomes attracted to Sidney but though Sidney is kind and attentive to her, beautiful and elegant Ms. Brereton also appears to have a share of his attentions.  But Ms. Brereton has a secret and Charlotte suspects that Sir Edward and Sidney may be involved.  In addition to Sidney, Sir Edward, Mr. Brudenall and Mr. Caton add romantic spice to the tale.  Rivalries and romantic complications ensue and the reader makes some interesting discoveries.  <br />Though Jane Austen passed away before completing this novel, &quot;Another Lady&quot; stays true to Ms. Austen's intentions and provides us  with an interesting climax and a happy, satisfying ending. Highly recommended!	2001-04-26

His books are always helpful, concise, not overloaded with unnecessary  info, very entertaining and filled with details such as hotel  rates/contacts, daytrips, ratings on sights, sample itineraries and many  more.  I'm bringing this book with me on my 3rd trip to the UK (and have  done so twice before).
