US	50671887	RXCWIIDPCBHJT	075820891X	136031735	Really Unusual Bad Boys	Books	3	4	4	N	Y	Almost Great	I wish I could give 3 1/2 stars! The first third of this book was fantastic, the middle dismal, and the ending nearly redeamed itself. <br /> <br />Bridefight- In MJD's tradition of sassy, talk & act first ask questions later women, she gives us Lois. She's just been forced off the police force and feels she has nothing left , so she contemplates suicide...only to wake up in the desert with a giant puma staring at her! She has somehow been transported to the SandLands, a fantasy realm where everyone are cat changlings. When in human form Lois's puma is the crown prince Damon. She quickly earns his interest as well as that of his father and 2 brothers. <br /> <br />Damon participates and wins the Bridefight, an event which happens every 3 years and allows the nobles their choice of bride. Ofcourse he picks our spunky heroine and eventually they live happily ever after. But now the younger princes need there mates as well... <br /> <br />Mating Season- Prince Maltese is wishing for his mate- and suddenly she drops from the sky! While Lois was from 2010, Anne is from 1945 and recently enlisted in the war effort. In a shortly contrived story she heads off the Sand Lands royal family from warring with a native race of unchangling brunettes who speak a strange language. Anne is conveniantly a language expert ( though why would the army have taught her spanish and manderin during WW2 when they would have taught her german & japanese?) Anyway, Maltese flips for her but I think the reader will find her pretty unlikable & annoying. <br /> <br />Groomfight- Lois was won in a bridefight and she feels its only right that the ladies of the realm get a chance to win prince Shakar. However before that can happen he is transported to a different world, one we think is Earth but turns out to be a simiallar planet in the future.Rica is this princes intended and is our first black heroine. She becomes pregnant with Shakar's baby and the two journey happily back to the SandLands to spread the good news...Only their just in time for the groomfight and Rica can't fully claim Shakar as her mate until she kicks all the other girls butts. Can she? Pregnant?	2005-09-23

This was a fairly good anthology though I found the newest authors story somewhat lacking and my usual beef with Mary Janice Davidson held true. While her stories are great, they are also ridiculously short! <br /> <br />The Bride Wore a .44- Maggie Shayne <br />Best known for her vampire series ( The Edge is fantastic!)Maggie gives us something right out of Alias. Our heroine is an amnesia victim after an explosion. She's about to wed a man she thinks is her long time fiance, but she's falling for her sexy wedding planner! The night before the wedding flashes of her former life as a spy start coming back and the ceremony is halted by a hail of bullets. Her wedding planner ( or is he her husband?!) and her fiance ( or is he the bad guy?!) are kidnapped and she straps on some Laura Croft like black leather and goes to save her perfect man. Which one is he again? <br /> <br />The Incredible Misadventures of Boo & the Boy Blunder- MJD <br />Very long title, very short story! Boo is a vampire slayer - the most prolific and heralded one of recent memory- who kills a vamp during his midnight munchies. He was chomping on a young male college student who realizes whats happening and immediately begins idolizing Boo. Much to her chagrin he tags along comparing her to Buffy & Batman. They go in search of her employer only to discover he himself is a vampire, though once a policeman and now an aspiring comedian. Eventually Boo can't help taking heer work (i.e. her employer) home with her and her sidekick comes along for the ride. <br /> <br />Warfem- Angela Knight <br />A story in the theme of her fantastic Jane's Warlord, this is set in the future with a part cyborg warrior heroine who is getting the crap kicked out of her. Just when she thinks she is done for, in walks the man that got away, fellow cyborg warrior Baird, to save the day. The two rehash old memories but he can't trust her for she's hiding secretsthat could get them all killed. Just when she's about to confess the bad guys strike. Can they save each other? And what's our heroine's little surprise? Knight is an author never to be missed! <br /> <br />Painkillers- Jacey Ford <br />Well a supermodel turned spy on the set of an exotic island photo shoot is our heroine. Now if I can believe the vampires and the cyborgs I should have been able to find this believable...but sadly it really didn't capture my imagination. I do have to say the doublecrossing despotic bad guy was well done...but should that really be the highlight? And the romance was WEAK. <br /> <br />The book didn't close with a bang but it was an enjoyable way to while away an afternoon. The big names do deliver.	2005-09-23

In her latest sci-fi romance she builds a believable Atlantis and a world full of mythical creatures that inhabit it. The dominant creatures in this lush land are the dragons, changlings that normally appear human but can change to their more reptillian self in an instant. King of the dragons is Darius. 300 years ago his family was slaughtered by travelers from the rest of the world and before he could even morn their loss he was installed as the Guardian of the Mist, forced to slaughter any who came through the portal into their world.  <br /> <br />Staggering haphazardly through the wilds of the rain forest is Grace, a twenty something looking for life...though she can't even find her brother.

If that means traveling to her world or fighting off a deadly menace of vampires, so be it.	2005-09-23

Mercenaries is a compilation of three related short stories that center around members of the mercenery starship Starrunner. The first story features Capt. Nathan August & his whirlwind love affair with  religious planet cult member, Trinity Yeager. Trin is willing to to do anything to get off the zealots colony - including taking the captain up on his drunken  bargain of passage in exchange for a night with both himself and Sebastion, his first officer, at the same time. <br /> <br />Quickly following is Sebastions story of falling head over heals for a dominant/submissive princess while the Starrunners merceneries are on a rescue mission.He's there bait, their spy to get into the palace. But can he handle being a submissive? Or does his captor really want to be captivated? <br /> <br />Lastly is the story of a female mercenery from Starrunner who made a cameo appearance in the first short story. During an interplanetary war where merceneries have been hired on both sides, Cassidy is embattled in a deadly dogfight against an opposing mercenery warrior. In a last ditch effort at survival she ditches onto a lonely planet only to be followed by her pursuer. When Rune sees that the impressive warrior is a woman he decides that in his culture - where women are scarce- she would make a perfect edition to his future gene pool. <br /> <br />All the stories had a spark & related well, but I just couldn't  buy the concept that all 3 couples were ready to push their different cultures aside & marry after just 24 hours - 3 weeks. Real life is a little more complicated. But if your just trying to escape from said real life, than I guess kick back and enjoy yourself!	2005-09-14

The dialogue of this novel was so beautiful I may force my husband to read it and learn a thing or two! <br /> <br />Cian Kelter is the oldest of our druid hotties yet. A genetic freak born in the 9th century & made laird at birth, he has all the possible magical abilities bred into  the Kelter line. Naively he invited another druid into the castle one night, an evil twisted man, and to sum up events Cian ended up stuck in an enchanted mirror perched on his enemies study wall for the past 1,133 years. And he'd have probably stayed there...if the magic that enabled a previous Kelter hotty to serve hadn't also triggered an unheard of string of events... <br /> <br />Passed through the black market and still trapped in his mirror, Cian has to hide out for 3 more weeks and his entrapment will end. He ends up in the round about possesion of Jessi St. James, an overworked anthropology graduate in Chicago. Convincing her to summon him from the mirror a few brief hours each day, Cian is able to slay the assasins the baddy sends after Jessi & himself only to find - with the hillarious help of his Kelter descendants- that Jessi is his soul mate. But winning his freedom may very well kill him & the love he feels... <br /> <br />The series in order: <br />Beyond the Highland Mist <br />To Tame a Highland Warrior <br />Kiss of the Highlander <br />The Dark Highlander <br />The Highlander's Touch <br />The Immortal Highlander <br /> <br />	2005-09-14

Somehow though it just couldn't sink it's teeth into me.Hopefully it will be a series though and win me completely over. <br /> <br />Rhys was a regency viscount in Britain two hundred years ago when he & his 2 brothers were transformed into vampires by a bloodthirsty, horny, evil vampiress.

Tony is, as we learned previously, a werewolf. Bitten by his mafia boss's girlfreind in an assasination gone bad, Tony is transforming even further. Now he is developing new and rare psychic powers. He catches freaky glimpses into the past of the people around him. Plus he can actually see the color of a magical aura around his fellow Sazi, or were creatures.<br /><br />Now we have a host of new characters for what is shaping into a great series.

US	50671887	R3K2WPS8LQBROO	1596321288	346578511	Hard Candy	Books	4	41	42	N	Y	Yummy!	Well who couldn't love anything that Angela Knight has written? Her shopping lists are probably erotic! That said these stories are a bit scandalous and not for everyone. All of them are about menage a tois involving 2 men and one lucky woman. However, it's not all about the woman! Two of the stories highly involve male/male sexual situations, so be prepared that you may not feel comfortable with them. <br /> <br />Hero Sandwich- Angela Knigh <br />A great story of a super stealthy camera toting ex-villainess and the two comic book type super hero's that she spies on. The brother duo decides to extract a little revenge and see just how far Paparazzi is willing to go for an exclusive. A very tasty treat with a happy ending! <br /> <br />Candy For Her Soul-Sheri Gilmore <br />One of Satan's demons has started his own little southern family and after years of disinterest he decides his son should get everything he wants. That includes the TWO loves of his life. Bad boy Nico has been in love with geeky Natalie since they were little kids...unfortunately he showed it by tormenting her and Natalie fell in love with his bestfriend David. But David always wanted to be more than friends...This is a great, very well written love story. This is a bit explicit in the mens relationship and the love scenes were a bit rushed but as an all-around story it was great and I'd love to read more from this author. <br /> <br />Fortune's Star-Morgan Hawke <br />The longest of the three offerings this is a futuristic, space thiller with characters who are genetically modified, psychic, or android/ghosts. It's well written with great love scenes and inventive but a bit confusing with the heroine having various tallents and wanting to be dominated but still wanting to be completely independant. That said it is still good and the whole book is worth the price!	2005-09-01

And I'm betting it's the start of a new series. In fact, I demand that it be! The secondary charcters were so charming and well written that you couldn't help falling in love with them. <br /> <br />Roman is your typical alpha male bored, rich, playboy vampire. But like all vampires who are worth their cravable books, Roman has hidden depths and secrets from his past that way heavily upon him.

Because of his original vows to God, Roman takes the burden of his fellow vampires damned soles personal.  <br /> <br />These days he is a brilliant scientist. He developed synthetic blood for the benefits of his species and human kind. And he's on the verge of a formula that will allow him to stay awake during daylight.However, thanks to two of his slightly bumblesome but extremely lovable vampire employees he now finds one of his fangs stuck in a sex toy.

But what little existance she has left is in jeopardy when one night at her dentistry practise the mafia decides to silence her for good. Lucky for her a sexy man carrying what looks like a wolf fang comes to carry her to safety.  <br /> <br />It's weird that he has a staff of Highlander security guards (were those really tartan covered coffins she saw them sleeping in?), a harem of woman in the parlor watching the DVN channel on the tv ( Digital Vampire Network - their joking right?), and the ability to have telepathic sex (yummy!) but whose complaning? <br /> <br />This book is a laughing rollercoaster of fun that will leave you craving more!

Her characters are interesting with lively dialogue, the love scenes are atleast warm if not roasting, and the storylines are more than inventive. However, The Dare didn't have the same edge of your seat breathlessness that the Challenge had. <br />  <br />Our main couple are both characters from the The Challenge. Zical, our hero, is a warrior on a planet with loads of psychic abilities who is a little lonely. Dora...well she was The Challenge's heroines bestfriend in the form of an AI super-planetcontrolling-computer. She was the thinking personality of the computer if you like. But she longs to be human and after setting scanners on Zical she decides to grow herself a body.Her transfer into that body and her adaption to the human race are the start of this couples tale.  <br /> <br />Dora's never able to fully leave her computer self behind and Zical screws up on a universal proportion when he almost gets an entire galaxy, himself, Dora, and his crew killed - several times. But after the couple rockets off into the depths of space, while still intiguing, the story really started to drag for me. That's not to say that it wasn't good, it was! There were just a lot of inconsistancies. I kept thinking the book would have to have a continuation but all of a sudden - after 356 long pages - everything was wrapped up tidily in a few paragraphs! <br /> <br />If you loved the Challenge and Ms. Kearney than it is worth reading the latest story. Just don't feel you need to rush out to get it.	2005-08-07

It starts off well but is a little light on being a seriouse paranormal book. It does cover some vamp culture and mixes in werewolves but don't delude yourself. While fun to read it is basically plentiful erotica for erotica's sake. There's nothing wrong with that...justdon't take this on a family vacation. There's a time and a place people even if our characters don't realize it!	2005-08-07

Fall Fury is the continuation of two other books Jaci Burton has written - A Storm For All Seasons : Summer Heat ( chronicalling the elementally magical Storm family ) and Devlin Dynasty ( werewolves). <br /> <br />This time Max Devlin, werewolf of Boston, is in search of a mate. He knows exactly who he wants: Shannon Storm, fiery daughter of New Orleans's Storm family. And since he's been sent to help them with their P. R. campaign extolling their new casino its time to make his move. They'll be working together every day in the sultry southern heat and fall hasn't gotten chilly yet... <br /> <br />Shannon can't believe her family thinks she needs help with public relations and she doesn't want anything to do with the northerner they've brought in. And if her mother and sister don't shut up about her \\"destiny\\" soon she may just have to conjure a storm to do it for them. And why does a wolf suddenly show up in her neighborhood stalking her?! <br /> <br />For those who loved the previose novels the love scenes in this book are few but far more explicit ( if possible) than previousely. Seriousely, even if you've been a romance reader for years, you are still going to blush over this one! The story is also better, I thought, in this book than the others. I only wish Ms. Burton would finallly get around to chilly Logan's story!	2005-08-07

What a dynamic book! I loved that the entire thing was narrated from the main character - a male perspective! I think this must be a first for a popular paranormal romance!  <br /> <br />As an introduction into the world of the Sazi - the were creatures on the fringe of existance- this book was explosive. Not only was the hero likable and interesting even though he contradicts most everything we are taught as good people, the heroine who initially looks like a train wreck is also great! <br /> <br />Tony Giodone is our anti-hero, a newly made werewolf in the mafia and an assasin. His newest client also becomes his girlfriend. Only she hired him to kill her! <br /> <br />Sue is a multi- MULTI-millionaires who is miserable! Her mother is killing her, literally! She is so clinging and conniving that Sue feels only death can provide her with some peace. <br /> <br />Tony initially is interested in his reaction to Sue and invites her to his lair. However he didn't realize the pull of he full moon was coming so soon...to everyones shock instead of snacking on Sue when Tony suddenly transforms, he finds that she is his true mate. Throw in some mafia grudges, a little whodoneit, a good deal of sexual sparking, and a lot of adrenaline and you have the makings of a great paranormal series!	2005-08-07

Dangeruese, our first starring role female Dark Hunter, learns this first hand when the two souless lovers fall for each other.

This is by far the best of Sherrilyn kenyon's books and the original Dark Hunter novel. It builds off of the prequil if you will of Julian's story in Fantasy Lover. If you want to avidly read this series than you need to start with this book to fully understand everything that follows. <br /> <br />Kyrian was screwed over big time in life by the one person he had given up his kingdom and his family for...his wife. Transformed into a Dark Hunter to seek a revenge he never took, Kyrian has been entrusted by the gods for the past 2 millenium to guard humanity. Only now he finds himself handcuffed to a psychic sex kitten, his bestfreind back from the dead, and a big baddy by the name of Desiderius who won't die and makes Kyrian relive his own execution by crusifiction. <br /> <br />Amanda is just your normal girl in a mixed up family when she's confused for her twin and knocked out.

I just finished Beyond the Pale and I want more! For anyone who loves the thrill of a good vamp or fantasy novel this one is a keeper. Part of the allure of this style of writing is fantastic characters who maybe don't fit into a stereotypical role. It makes them interesting! And there's no shortage of interesting characters in his book. <br /> <br />Daphne is our main character and we catch up with her doing the tediuose 20 year annual errand of getting a new drivers license with a new identity to hide the fact that she is actually a 450 year old vampire. However she finds that she's being followed by several groups: one of which catches her and forces her to join project Darkwing. <br /> <br />Project Darkwing is a new anti-terrorism group lead by the handler J and comprised of three newly recruited vampires: Daphne who speaks 13 languages and has a genius IQ, Benny- a wise-cracking southern belle from Branson who is an expert on jewels, and Cormac- the gay drama queen actor who lacks the ability to remain seriouse. <br /> <br />Their first assignment: Stopping a Russian weapons dealer drom selling a nuclear device to Al Quida and also from aquiring art full of dark mojo is complicated by the appearance of Darius della Chiesa, who has also been following Daphne. He thought she was a vampire but after seeing her with a tan he changes his tune. He and Daphne can't trust each other but as they work together to help the mission they quickly fall in love. <br /> <br />Ofcourse all's not well that ends well, since our anti-hero Mr. della Chiese is also a vampire slayer...hmm, how does Daphne explain that one to her mother? <br />	2005-06-22

And Unmasked is a decent read, but not as breathtaking as the other books. <br /> <br />Previouse hero Zain Masters little sister is in trouble on her first piloting mission for the family shipping company. Her troublr is space pirate Qaade Deter whose plundering her ship. Unknown to Torrie, our heroine, Qaade is stealing badly needed medical supplies for his secret ring of slave assitance. Think a futuristic underground railroad for slaves who have had their memories completely erased. Ofcourse when she catches up with him and unmasks him, the two work together to end the illegal slave trade in their sector. All together it is a little formulaic. There are really no twists. And unlike the other UN books which had great riddles and puzzles and adventure, this one is just muddling its way to the finish line of a romance. That's not to say that it won't entertain you. But it just isn't memorable.	2005-06-18

She blends humor and self-depricating yet take charge heroines with storylines that you usually won't want to put down. But I stand by an earlier critisism that her stories keep getting shorter & shorter. Our leading lady is a feisty blue haired mutant that can go invisable and phaze through solid objects. She uses these talents to supplement her income. But she steals from the wrong guy (although Mr. Right). He's a human, but largely machine for reasons frustratingly unexplained. Ofcourse in 53 pages they hit it off and he saves her from the bad guy in the big fanale. But why exactly is she working for a bad guy? At 53 pages it reeled you in then spit you back out entertained but slightly bereft. <br /> <br />Stranded - Angela Knight is becoming one of The big names if you want a take charge, pull you in fantasy with a side of kinky. In her extreme take on a reality show she gives plenty of Way Out There alpha male. I love her books but I definitely blushed when reading this one. <br /> <br />Light on her Toes - I'd never read Camille Anthony, whose story takes up most of this anthologies space. MY HELPFUL HINT: Flip to the alien vocab terms that follow after the story! (before you read the tale duh!)Without that the terminology is very distracting and hard to figure out what the heck the characters are talking about. It's an alien rendition of the somewhat typical warrior girl battles warrior boy for equal footing in a relationship. It notes a previous story of this author which may be handy to read first. <br /> <br />So, have fun reading - all together it's an entertaining book to pick up!	2005-06-03

Ok, I was a little torn about picking this book up from some of the reviews but it was surprisingly good. It sort of reaches out, grabs your interest, chains it up, & doesn't let you go till the last page when you want the next book now! <br /> <br />There was a cheesy article written about Dr. Alexandra Keller in Time that she was the fastest scalpel in the world. A plastic surgeon like her is exactly what Michael Cyprian needs. So, when he can't bribe her to work for him, he resorts to typical vampire practises and kidnaps her.  <br /> <br />Alex, who does a lot of free be work as she was an orphaned hard luck case herself once, disdained working for Michael whom she assumed was a pampered sagging millionaire. But the guy has no face! So she gives him his sight and face back. The surgery takes a lot out of him so he helps himself to a drink of the doc...But she survives and pioneers a whole new future for the Darkyn (vamps). <br /> <br />With creepy characters, a pawn of Alex's priest brother, deformed Darkyn, a BIG TWIST, our sassy main & supporting characters, and a sneek peak at our next hunky/tortured hero this book is a definite read & keep!	2005-06-03

If you are a particular fan of this author and her style I'm sure you'll enjoy it. But for anyone else, the author seems undeveloped. Had I not seen the plug on the front cover that says she's a USA Today bestselling author I would have thought this was her first book. The main charcters are barely developed at all. The most revealing thing we know about them is that Serena, the heroine, is a supposedly beautiful 36 year old virgin. Yeah... The secondary characters are more fleshed out and likeable but still the book comes over as corny and slapstickish. If you need a really, really light read because your waiting to get a route canal at the dentists then sure, have fun reading. But for everyone else it's really not worth picking up.	2005-05-19

If you loved Clue as a kid or just crave a hillarious and well written story, this is the book for you! The dialogue both internally and between characters was brilliantly written and the author gives beautifully lyrical description. <br /> <br />One of the main characters , Thomas Heyworth, has just died. He was a reclusive, odd, rich, mystery writer. Since he has no heirs to leave his millions and Mayhem Manor to he stages a treasure hunt to determine the winner. He pairs up people from his past into teams, stages clues, and sets a time limit. But a new twist is added since Thomas was murdered. Just before he died he knew who was going to make an attempt on his life and sends letters letting the contestants know that the murderer will be revealed by the winning contestants...and that one of the people in the room with them is the killer. <br /> <br />Team number one is Edmunds the butler ( who has a 26 year old secret) and the bumblingly mysterious psychic Madame Grovda who had an affair with Thomas long ago. Team 2 is Lorne, Thomas's secretary, and the reclusive poet Dabney James. However there's a darling twist to that team... <br /> <br />The final team is comprised of our hero and heroine. Evie Randall was Thomas's beloved ward who would do anything to catch his killer and keep her home. Max Galloway was Thomas's sulky stepson. They hated each other. But Max is also a cop that would like to see the killer captured. And if he can see as much of Evie's assets as well all the better! Only, someone is trying to kill her just as they did Thomas, for they belive that she may be his true heir. <br /> <br />Will the killer be revealed or will our charcters fall prey to the suspicions of one another and do each other...in? Read and find out! I'm not telling!	2005-05-16

Don't let Grandma read this book unless she has a good pacemaker! <br /> <br />If you read Master of the Night ( and I strongly suggest that you do before reading this book ) than you know that our hero King Llyr is king of the fairy's. Well, King of the Cachamwri fairies atleast. As it turns out Llyr has an evil brother who rules the Morven fairies. They've been cursed by their father's death bed wish to not outright kill the other. Though the evil brother, Ansgar,  has hired assasins over the last 1600 years who have killed 4 of Llyr's wives and all 10 of his children. <br /> <br />In another bid to closely ally himself with the Vampires and maga that also exist in this alternate Earth, and thus win himself a hardier bride, Llyr is seeking out some of the evil vamps from the last book. To that end he travels to Verdaville, South Carolina the territory of a very protective werewolf named Diana. She's Dire Kind a race also created by Merlin, just like the Magekind of Llyr's world. Dire Kind were created just in case the other magical creatures went bad so Diana is imperviouse to both the evil vamps & the fairies magic. This makes her an incredible asset to Llyr. Also she's conveniantly the city manager and reserve cop...plus you know she's in heat and Llyr's last mistriss got KO'ed so you can see where this is headed. <br /> <br />Warning! There are quite explisive sex scenes every chance Ms Knight (known to be a scintillatingly steamy author)could take. One wonders if Diane isn't actually a werebunny!But it works for this book. Not a brilliant read lke her Forever Kiss, but still very enjoyable. <br /> <br />	2005-05-12

Some of her bestfriends are werewolves & shapeshifters while vampire's are the greatest thing to ever come out of the closet (casket?) since theirs are the only thoughts her telepathy doesn't get bombarded by.

If that's not enough for her to cope with sexy Alcide is cranky and struggling through a pack dispute, Bill the Ex has a new floozy, Sherrif Eric is breathing down her neck (even if it does turn her on), she might be stalked by a tiger, someones getting staked by Merlotte's kitchen, & she' still trying to hide the death of Alcide's ex in her own kitchen.

Well, Ms. MacAlister is at again and she's given us a hot new entry in the life of Aisling Grey. This book is great, maybe a smidge less explosive than You Slay Me, the first book in the series, but still addictive. <br />   <br />Aisling is a Gaurdian, a person born to use magic to seal portals to Hell which are spread throughout the world. She's new to this, infact she only found out about the entirety of the \\"Otherworld\\" about a month ago and has decided to study up at a Guardian convention being held in Budapest. She figures she can kill two birds with one stone and agrees to courrier another antiquity for her uncle, just as in the previous book. <br />  <br /> Many roadblocks will stand in her way though and one of them will be her impossible to live with smolderingly sexy wyvern mate ( or dragon wanna be husband for those of you not in the know). Drake Vireo, leader of the green dragons, is sex in scales( but yummier in his human form) and Aisling can't help her attraction to him even though there are definite unresolved issues between them.  <br /> <br />  Also trying to muck up her field trip are thieves, the three othe dragon wyvern's, a bakers dozen naked & horny Incubi, the Otherworld heirarchy, her pet demon Jim in Newfie dog form nearly dying, several murders, that little business of the challenge with Drake in the previous book, & a partridge in a pear tree. (OK the last was an exageration, but there is a pigeon) <br /> <br />  [...]. I was thrilled to see that she plans atleast 6 more books to Aislings story. Yeah! HOWEVER, I am left steaming and nearly irate as I found out that there will be A YEAR BETWEEN RELEASE DATES! A YEAR! Come on!

Marcus is not the simpering Lestat kind of a vampire. He's more the bite first and ask questions later vamp. Werefoxes wander in to the story and lead to an encounter with another vamp which sets up Ms. Sizemore's next story well.

Likes fast cars, fast women, and killing the occasional bad guy be they human or Tribe vamp. <br />Mia Luchese - unknown age, apparently an enthusiastic virgin, indepedantly wealthy. Likes a little o positive herself & thinks she's bad enough to become a wannabe vampire hunter. <br />  Well it sounds exciting enough but this story fell a little flat. Colin can't even figure out on his own that the woman he's been in bed with was a virgin. I understand he's way young for a Vampire but come on! And Mia isn't a real hunter, & she's not a vampire, but she likes sucking blood and she can make Colin forget that she does it although she doesn't realize she's pshycic...yeah. <br />  The real positives in this book are the reintroduction of the \\"I Burn for You\\" characters, the new vamp lore, and a brand new character Laurant who will be Ms. Sizemore's next hero although she hasn't given the release date. He made this book worth reading. Also sexy Tony Crowe is back and let's hope he also gets a book! <br />  I was also disapointed that Marcus from her last novel wasn't included in this book considering that the Patron ( head evil guy) was his personnal nemesis.  <br />  Altogether this book is definitly worth reading and will be a great way to kill a Sunday afternoon, it won't be a permanent fixture by your pillow.	2005-04-12

A seductive, lazy Southern setting combined with the reallistic modern love & life problems of todays women make this story. Don't get me wrong it's not a sappy story you see Valerie Burtonelli in. It's edgy and witty with plenty of steam generated by the main characters Emma Jean and Johnny.  <br />  Because of a misplaced assumption in the local gossip grapevine, everyone in Joyful, GA assumes Emma Jean is a porn star whose just returned to there town after a long absense. It doesn't hurt that she left after an embarrassing nudity incident with the local bad boy heart throb. Blissfully unaware of the rumors, Emma Jean only ends up feeding the flames of embarrassment through her own behavior, especially when she's around Johnny Walker.And every time Johnny sees her he just wants to grab her and bite her in unmentionable places.  <br />  Combined with several who done it mysteries, a cast of sparky secondary characters, and an interesting new idea on how to eat pie this book is a definite winner. Look for the next book in this series in September!	2005-03-28

Ms. Liu writes with unbelievable seasoned grace for a debut authur. Our hero is a cursed 2,000 year old tiger shape-shifter/ warrior who ends up as the possesion of a heroine who is no ordinary girl herself. She belongs to a group reminiscent of the x-men. Great characters abound and it's obvious we'll be seeing an already anticipated sequal or two. In fact Ms. Liu will be releasing her next book in August, this one with a vampire theme. <br />   From the modern stunning setting of China to the more familiar character driven, action packed US scenes you won't be able to put the book down. The sparks between the main characters leave the pages steamy.	2005-03-24

The author has released a great tease of a short story and the idea of the jager-suchers is seductive. However... <br />    I like a heroine whose strong and realistic, not simpering and brainless. Yet the heroine in this book was a mouthy badass taken just a little too far. Granted she went through a nightmarishly tramatic experience, but she ends up a little to winey and...let's face it, psycho. She has absoilutly no sanctity for life when she has lost her own loved ones. She's kind of a female Van Dam, amusing for a few chapters but soon wearying. She's not interesting enough to be an Anita Blake. Our hero and his counterpart Will are also made to sound like the little women who stay at home. Why can't the man and woman be equal? Plus don't Jager -suchers chase anything else except wolfs?  <br />     <br />	2005-03-19

If you haven't read it yet, don't worry. This books just as good as a stand alone. In fact, it's better than it's predecessor. For those who have read Ecstasy this story picks up with Thrain, our last hero's buddy, tracking down his pal's long lost daughter. As he shows up to explain her heritage and ask her to meet her dad, wiping out his guilt of her having gone missing in the first place, our funny cosmic trouble makers show up in disguise to assure sparks start flying between our hero and his new lady.  <br />     The modern setting is perfect for the story line and the dialogue is very witty. Ms. Bangs is starting to sound more like Mary Janice Davidson or Katie McCallister for those of you who are fans. It's a lighthearted read but at 339 entertaining pages it's definitly worth the price. Hints at the next book in this series are also revealed with the unveiling of a new alpha vampire charcter. All said it's worth sinking your teeth into!	2005-03-18

Hamilton her light story about a sexy bayou man who turns into a 2\\" tall bull frog every morning was very entertaining. It's a light read but the characters are very solid, have great dialogue, and are just zany enough to keep us interested. The whodoneit is a good twist as well that I didn't see coming. Also while not explicit the love scenes between our main couple are pretty hot and the heroine lands a prince with this frog! My only gripe was that the ending felt rushed and I would have liked an epilogue.	2005-03-14

(The Gorgeous Series, Book 1)	Books	3	40	47	N	N	long wait for a short story	OK, I'm a huge MJD fan & have all of her books but I have to say I'm dissapointed in this latest release. Spanning only 194 pages, in large font, & with blank pages between every chapter it felt like she'd written a short anthology style story and the publisher needed to make a few bucks so they slapped some coming attractions in the back and an inflated price on the front. The story is still good beside the length however 3 of the main characters seem almost exact replicas of the 3 main characters in her Undead series. Instead of Betsy you have blonde slightly ditzy Caitlyn. Sinclair, Undead's dark brooding hero, is renamed Dmitri. And the black in control bestfriend is renamed Stacey instead of Jessica. Sure the dialogue is still extremely witty and funny, but we read MJD because she has fresh ideas and doesn't churn out rehashed, repetative driffle. Don't get me wrong I still have the next undead book safely tucked away for pre-order where it has lived for months. But I may wait and read the reviews on anything new she has coming up. Oh & BTW, the bit on the front cover about Manolo Blahnik's? (Hello, also very Betsy Undead!) It's just a teaser to get you to buy the book! No shoes were either mentioned nor harmed in the printing of this book.	2005-02-28

If you like to read Sherrilyn Kenyon, Julie Kenner, or Karen Marie Moning you're sure to get your moneys worth out of this book. While it's essentially a light, fluffy read it's still very touching and will have you laughing out loud! Even the divine have ther foibles and favorites. I hope Ms. McKnight plans this book as a first in an entertaing series.	2004-01-19
