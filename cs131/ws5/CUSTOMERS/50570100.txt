I was caught up in the story and didn't want to put it down. The hero was caught up in his own agenda, already set into motion, when he learned the president's daughter was in danger. He stepped in to help but still had to finish his dealings. This took away from the book for some but I thought it made a &quot;one step ahead of the killer&quot; fast paced read.	2001-07-28

I really enjoyed the first book, The Wild Child, but didn't find this book to be anything special.

She goes back in time hoping to change things. Her cousin Florence is such a nice devoted wife but shy of her wifely duties. Griffin is fond of her so they can't act on their love for each other behind her back but we have to read about their going without each other until she dies. I couldn't enjoy such a plot.

You follow them through solving the mystery of what happened to Dinah and why. Dinah watched over her friend when she was in a coma but after Dinah turns up missing, Faith recovers from the coma without her memories. Danger lurks. Faith starts believing she has a limited psychic connection to Dinah. She and Kane use her visions and Dinah's voice in her head to slowly uncover what happened to Dinah and why. The villian aspect was downplayed and the ending was a suprise twist for the two friends which made me think of The Sixth Sense. This book can be read on it's own without reading the first. Noah, a character used in each book, is more of a supporting friend to Kane instead of able to help solve this mystery with his psychic abilities.	2001-01-17

Ransom has an evil baron who murdered the heroine's father before her eyes years ago and now holds her captive until forcing her to do his bidding. Learning he's involved with a  clan traitor and had a child kidnapped, she bravely saves the boy at great  cost to herself. She and the boy reach the Highlands. As a sure way to  bring his warrior protector, she calls herself the bride of the Buchanan; a  daunting, fierce giant of a Laird whom all fear. She's like no other woman  he's met. She has to save her uncle from the evil baron by finding her  sister who has hidden safely in the Highlands thus far and outwit the  baron. Ramsey's and Bridget's story could have been given more time but a  great read. It stands on my keeper shelf.	2000-01-02

The hero hadn't been back since he'd left her years ago. He was afraid to consumate their love because he couldn't risk  loving/hurting her being a beserker. He now tries acting indifferent and I  think this &quot;courtship&quot; went on way too long in the book and would  rather have read more of his family of berserkers instead.	1999-12-09
