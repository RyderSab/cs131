Thinking itself is also a skill -- it is a skill that requires training.  This book is a beginner's grammar for that skill.<br /><br />With a professor from Stanford (James Adams) leading the way, this book is good for the student of thinking.  For the humans who are done thinking, or who have never started, this book will be reviewed as poor or useless.  As for the rest of us, this is fantastic stuff.<br /><br />One application I derive from this short text is something that might resonate with the internet community.  Recall any of the internet conversations/debates you have had/read where the discussion tanked into non-creative attacks. Usually someone with a new idea presents the idea, then the non-creative sharks move in and chew up everyone in the water.  Such sharks are conceptually blocked from having their own creativity (well, not always but many times).  And if we have been the shark, or have been chomped by a few, there is a benefit in the analysis in this book -- if nothing else, it brings awareness to what it means to attack creativity.<br /><br />The range of discourse, the field of applicability and the space of usefulness of this book is large; it applies to anyone who has to use the brain.  Ironically, it sheds light on the world that has been critiqued by the Dilbert cartoons.  Scott Adams could be brother to James, for the comic strip is an exploration of creativity road-blocks.  And, like many of the pointed haired bosses, those who most need this book may never benefit from it (even if they read it).	2005-07-10

Jane Jacobs, a Canadian, centers her discussion around a main thesis that a kind of doomsday scenario faces North America.  She bases her thesis on five pillars:<br /><br />1) Community structures are crumbling -- and this can be traced back to motor-industry-sponsored road systems which promote the loss of intimacy in neighborhoods, 2) Universities are really credentialing institutions and not places of higher education, 3) The loss of critical scientific thinking skills among the scientific, 4) The loss of self-regulating agencies among professional fields (loss of professional guilds), and 5) I forget what five was for.<br /><br />Her main thesis can be ignored while still benefiting from her discussion of the five pillars (that's how I read it).<br /><br />Jane comes off as a self-appointed prophetess, and that will detract some readers from her otherwise thought-provoking cultural insights. She seems to be the product of her own thinking (an older woman living alone in an apartment writing books). Despite that, there are some nuggets waiting for the forgiving reader.<br /><br />Her thesis is rooted in the cherished notion that world history is cyclical.  For her that means that past nations with some institutions like ours are indicators of our future.  They have historically gone the way of the Dark Age, therefore we are headed to a dark age.  All of this is to assume too much.  We are in un-chartered territory and the past may not be a cyclical indicator of the future.  With the unrivaled technology we have, it is hard to imagine that the past maps neatly to the future.  Granted, human nature of the past is a good indicator of human nature in the future, but one can't extrapolate from that and predict the movement of complex technological societies.<br /><br />This book can be read in one sitting; so even if you invest your time in reading it, you will not have invested a lot of it, and I suspect many will enjoy the discussion of the university system  -- along those lines, see the great book, \\"Class\\" by Fussell.lines, see the great book, \\"Class\\" by Fussell.	2005-05-31

The Precalc material can be covered rapidly and is well done.  I am quite happy about this front matter -- it is perfectly suited for getting the student ready for Calculus.  Even if a teacher does not intend to teach any Precalc material, there is a satisfaction in having it available when new-found deficiencies need to be remedied.  This is especially true at the high school level.<br /><br />Once into the Calculus chapters, Trigonometry is saved for after the Integral.  This helps the class to concentrate on the fundamentals of series, limits, derivatives and the integral.<br /><br />I don't know of a teacher's manual for this edition.  And, I have only found myself frustrated by one wrong answer in the back.  The problem sets offer plenty of opportunity to master the graphing calculator (a TI-83 is sufficient, though a TI-89 could be preferred).  Especially good are the questions that lead the students into understanding the concepts -- \\"Getting the Concept\\" is a constant theme throughout the exercises.  The problems are gradated, as one would expect, and the applications cover many fields (perhaps explaining why the book is so thick).<br /><br />No textbook will completely satisfy any teacher, but this one is useful as a base line for a whole year of study.  Being a first edition, it is well edited and has obviously been tested.  I have not found any serious weaknesses; I will certainly use it again.  The articles on the CD are hit-and-miss.  Some are far too technical for most students, but some are just right.  The proof and lead-up to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus are easy to follow and well explained -- the authors use the Mean Value Theorem (the Squeeze Theorem is not heavily developed in the book).<br /><br />Calculus is well established as an introductory course and its curriculum is predictable; keeping with that, this book does not seem to establish any revolutionary directions.  It has succeeded at being modern, easy to follow and pleasing to the eye and mind.  It could be used to satisfy the AP course requirements (AB), though I am not using it that way.  The same company teamed up with Ron Larson and published an AP text that has received great praise. I imagine there is some overlap between this book and that one.<br /><br />I have a large laundry list of what I would like to see in a textbook, but so does everyone else!  We simply use a good standard text, like this one, to direct the class while invigorating the subject with our own materials.<br /><br />At the end of the day: no complaints at all.

Of course, anyone arguing a political position is going to frame their point with the kinds of metaphor that advance their case:  That's Rhetoric!  In this book, Lackoff uncovers the rhetoric of the conservatives (of which I often find myself a supporter).<br /><br />What the progressives need to do (if they follow Lackoff's persuasive advise) is learn how to do what the Republicans have done: frame their positions in the positive.  As a case in point in failure, both sides of the 2004 election feel that the radical edge of the Democratic party did harm to their own cause.  The fringe failed to frame their points properly and so took a fall in the politics of rhetoric (and possibly took part of their party with them).  The movie on 911, the anti-Bush sentiment, etc., may have backfired because they were framed in angst and near-bitterness (and so failed to sell to large blocks of voters).<br /><br />Away from the fringe, John Kerry -- as has already been pointed out by other reviewers -- appears to have taken a few pages from this book.  Why did he then fail?  I can't answer that, but I will suggest that it is not sufficient to take a few pages from Lackoff. One must be more thoroughgoing than adopting a few rhetorical points (like arguing that we need \\"A stronger America\\" -- a phrase from Lackoff which some feel positively challenges Bush's war and defense doctrines).<br /><br />Rhetoric is important, but it must stand for positions. Ultimately, behind the rhetoric, there has to be some sort of action and solid position.  Lackoff comes off in this book as a man of consistent and strong conviction; those progressives who read his book won't make up for a lack of demonstrable intent with mere rhetoric, both are required.<br /><br />Because I am conservative, I feel compelled to offer a slight corrective to how I understand many reviewers take Lackoff (I think he might agree).  Conservative Rhetoric is not wrong in and of itself.  When a phrase such as \\"Pro-Life\\" is used, the impact of the phrase is purposeful, and the possible range of phrases not used is also purposeful.  Don't let this confuse you, however.  Such rhetoric stands for what is really believed.  Therefore, \\"Pro-Life\\" is not mere rhetoric.  It is a phrase that stands for what is felt to be the intent of the phrase.  Many conservative phrases that are used to frame debates are not used out of desperation to bolster illogical or losing points (of course the other side thinks they are illogical and losing).  They are used out of conviction.  So, for example, Bush probably does believe that terrorists are evil.  The use of the rhetoric of casting the military targets into the worst possible light is not simply rhetoric: it captures the essence of Bush's convictions.  Likewise, progressive rhetoric that flows from a reading of this book will hopefully capture the beliefs of the progressives.<br /><br />Lackoff suggests that progressives need to become better at framing the political discussions. Our country thrives on good rhetoric that argues persuasively for the positions of various sectors of thought.  However, the reader of Lackoff should not come away from this book as if it shows that conservative rhetoric is fiendish or dark.  The rhetoric of both sides is purposeful, and in both cases (at the best moments) should represent reality and firm convictions.  Therefore, it's not good enough to vote for the man who says we need a 'Stronger America'; we need actual policy behind that phrase that advances or seeks its essence.  Bush has an actual policy (one may disagree with it, but one knows what it is), and so his rhetoric appears to come from real convictions.  The progressives need good rhetoric that stands for specific and known policy positions.  I suggest to Lackoff that many of his liberal readers who adopt his book's premise (about framing debates to positively advance the cause) must not confuse that with conservatives having been successful at advancing secret ulterior motives.<br /><br />Furthermore, it is not enough to be good at rhetoric (as an end unto itself) -- that would be to misread Lackoff.  It may be the case that people honestly believe the reality behind the conservative rhetoric. Those who voted for conservatives in 2004 are not fools who bought the huckster's fake miracle cure (duped by clever rhetoric), but -- and I know it is hard to imagine -- many actually agreed with the policy codified by the rhetoric.<br /><br />Lackoff is easily one of the more stimulating authors I encounter (even when he makes me angry!).  His book is a rewarding read, even for those conservatives who will not agree with all his points.  I do think that some of Lackoff's more scientific work is blunted by his own presuppositions about the nature of man and the world, all of which comes out in this book.<br /><br />I will end this review (it's more like a reply) with a recent example where it appears that one Democrat is taking Lackoff to heart. After the last election Hillary Clinton came out in speeches using the name of \\"Jesus\\".  In some detail she spoke of Jesus as a liberal who cared for the needy.  She claimed that the Democratic Party  advances the ideals of Jesus-religion.  This is her positive framing of the religious question (cf. Lackoff).  Instead of chastising Republicans for their overt Evangelical ties, she is offering a Lackoff like positive answer.  And, in her rhetoric she is honest -- she really views Jesus as being like her and her party.  She has recast him into the mold of the compassionate liberal.  Her rhetoric matches belief, and this may help in the Southern red states where he still has a high approval rating.  However, if we ever take the time to find out what her convictions entail, some voters may be disappointed.  Does she accept or reject the Jesus of Mormonism? Does she align herself with the man on the cross in Mel Gibson's film?  Who is her Jesus?  Is she Unitarian in belief, or does she claim to have the Jesus of Orthodox Protestantism?  Does she believe that the man in 1st century Israel was god in flesh?  Does she want to follow all the Bible's theological teachings, or the abstracted moral codes?  Evangelicals might not buy what Hillary is offering; they are not religious only, but keep Jesus close to heart in a deep commitment to his identity.  Does she?  Is she using him in a bid for the presidency?  What is behind her positive framing?  She really believes what she says, but the reason for her rhetoric will be found-out if it does not match the dogma of those she seeks to win.<br /><br />Lackoff makes this kind of analysis possible, and encourages it in this book.t stands for specific and known policy positions.

US	51315014	R13WBRLPAU4T8H	0465037712	688146771	Where Mathematics Come From: How The Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics Into Being	Books	5	35	42	N	N	The endorsement of a high school Calculus teacher	I could imagine that the authors of this book might reply to an earlier review by explaining how Pi, which is 3.14159..., exists only in the human brain as the notion of a perfect circle.  It is the way the human brain describes what does not actually exist.  As far as I know, no circle has been found or created where if we were to measure it at the atomic level we would find the circumference divided by the width yielding an infinite series of digits that works out to our pi. Zooming in on the edge of a circle to get infinite precision would not work -- the granularity would give way to decreased edge perfection.  Creation is not as clean as the human's ideal circle.  And we can't clean up creation and create the perfect circle infinitely accurate down to the quark level.  What we can say is that circles -- from human observation -- are best codified in neural pathways by the notion of pi.  But pi does not actually exist (and it is only romantic faith that believes that it exists in some world -- a world no one has seen!).<br /><br />In \\"Where Mathematics Comes From\\", Lakoff and Nunez defend their thesis that the only kind of mathematics that humans can know are the kind that are known to human minds.  Human mathematics is embodied mathematics, and not necessarily representative of some absolute transcendent truth.  This non-Platonic way of looking at math should liberate the reader from what the authors call the \\"Romantic\\" version of math.<br /><br />Romantic math involves the mathematician casting his symbolic universe into the heavenly realm as if math were a religious expression of eternal norms -- norms that everyone is expected to observe on bended knee (as it were).  Such notions of math are not embodied, but transcendent and disembodied (existing outside of humanity).  The authors take this romantic view to task (I think rightly so).<br /><br />Cognitive science is one way they arrive at their counter philosophy.  And the study of the brain is how they ground mathematics in humanity, as to take it out of the theological realm.  In so doing, they work from at least three key ideas:<br /><br />1) Our life and our experiences (i.e. our bodily existence) shape our knowledge, our structures and our concepts.  We don't know transcendent mathematical truth -- we know the math that is knowable by the human brain, which is the embodied mind.  This idea that our knowledge conforms to the structure and makeup of our humanity is so basic to the thesis of the book -- and so simple a concept -- that it may be easy to miss its power.  This idea frees mathematics from a kind of religious absolutism that has created fear and awe of the subject.  Math is not a deity, nor is it the realm of the deity -- it is the domain of the human mind (which is not to deny a real deity, but only to locate math in the only place we know it to exist: in the human).  The authors provide convincing reasons why this is true, then they give convincing reasons why we need to get this right.  Getting it wrong has created a situation where math is feared (like a god). An earlier reviewer took issue with this point by stating that pi is pi no matter where one goes.  I hope I have illustrated from my opening paragraph how we may have miscalculated how essentially human pi really is (and remains).  Pi is *our* pi!  Even given this point, Lackoff and Nunez still affirm that math works predictably.  Our observations of the world of circles, no matter where we go, should predictably conform to our infinite number called pi (depending on the accuracy of the circle). But pi is still our number (and that's the point).  Experience tells us that circles approximate pi, so we are wise to have it as it is. But that does not mean pi is outside of us, or anything other than something the human brain came to via neural pathways. There is no necessity of postmodernism in so arguing, and the authors point this out.  This does not open the door to relativistic math.<br /><br />2)  Not all thoughts are conscious thoughts. This might help explain why we can speak so quickly while conforming to standard grammar (without thinking about conjugations, tense agreements, etc.).  We think at a level we don't consciously know about, yet thinking is more than what we know about.  That is, our brain is more complex than what is at the front of our mind.  Perhaps you recall a \\"eureka\\" moment that came suddenly, as if from regions below the conscious radar.<br /><br />3)  Metaphor is how we know things, and the mapping of one domain of thought to another domain (for the sake of understanding) is metaphor.  It is metaphor because of essential realities, and not mere simile. That is, metaphor is more than a device of literature -- it is a way of grasping, and it involves the transfer of ideas between realms; it works as the basis of conceptualization.  We know our subject in the abstract (if we really know it) by having some connections with domains of discourse already familiar to us.  We know by analogy but not merely because the analogy is handy, but because the analogy holds in a fundamental way.  For an exercise, imagine how Venn Diagrams correspond to the simple idea of containment -- perhaps transfer your understanding of the Venn Diagram back onto real pottery containers.  Now consider how we abstract Boolean logic beyond the pottery -- even beyond the metaphor of containment and Venn Diagrams -- into pure symbolic language.  After enough layers of abstraction are piled on, the original conceptual grid seems forgotten, and so gives the life-support to mystical notions of math (hence the Romance that the symbolic world of math is only accessible to the enlightened).  But math is not abstract; it starts from human experience!<br /><br />As soon as I started reading this book, I found many new and useful ways to communicate math to my students -- both in ways conceptually satisfying to them and honest to the math.<br /><br />One strategy often used to make math easier to students is to go over the history of the math under discussion.  But let's be honest, knowing the history of Euler is not going to automatically reveal the structure of his mind (a structure that made his math obvious to him).  This book takes us beyond the history of math ideas, to the structure of math ideas.  This book takes us to the concepts that make the ideas accessible to the student's human mind.  By knowing the elementary concepts behind e, for example, we can gain more mileage than knowing its historical circumstances.  And so the book ends with a case study of e, and this alone should help a teacher who needs to reach the human mind of the student.<br /><br />This is the math book that I have been looking for as a teacher.  It is the math book I have been looking for after having read Russell and his philosophy of math.  This book is the book I was looking for in order to understand how metaphor works in human history.  It has application well beyond math, and its application to math is beyond anything I normally encounter. I cannot give this book high enough rating..  <br /> <br />2)  Not all thoughts are conscious thoughts.

Zondervan's Greek NT has definitions for all words occurring 30 times or less.  They do not parse words, they only provide definitions.<br /><br />I wish this book was more like the Greek New Testament by W. Perschbacher, which is horribly mis-titled \\"Refresh your Greek\\".  The advantage of Perschbacher's book (which contains either the UBS or Nestle-Aland -- I can't recall) is that he provides a vocab list before each book and he parses verbs in the footnotes.  Furthermore, he lists words occurring 50 times or less in the footnotes.  The disadvantages to Perschbacher's edition are three:  1. He does not reduplicate entries within a book, so that he sends you back to a footnote on a previous page if the word was defined earlier (this only happens within books, not within the whole NT).  2. His volume is more expensive and 3. \\"Refresh Your Greek\\" is hardback and much thicker (partly due to the brief grammar in the back of the book -- which is a plus).	2004-09-14

In 1928 a local farmer discovered--stumbled upon--the site, and in the following years thousands of cuneiform (wedge writing) texts were unearthed by French archaeologists.  The languages of these cuneiform tablets is primarily  Akkadian, Sumerian and Ugaritic (the last being an unknown language before 1928). The tablets all date to a time before 1200 B.C. (the approximate date when Ugarit was conquered and destroyed).  The texts are &quot;diplomatic correspondence, legal records, remedies for horses' ailments, long lists of gods, offerings, supplies, and personnel, dictionaries of word equivalents in the various languages used in the city, and the oldest complete alphabet, with an order substantially the same as that of our own.&quot;<br />Dr. Coogan's book is a translation of fifteen tablets recovered from the library of the priest Ilimilku from Shubbani, who was the chief priest of Baal in the city's main temple complex.  The texts were commissioned under King Niqmaddu II (c. 1375-1345), and four stories from that commissioning are here translated and published by Dr. Coogan.<br />The first translated story is titled Aqhat, which is the story of a man, Danel, who wants a son.  After entreating the chief god El, Aqhat is born to Danel.  The story then traces Aqhat and his struggles with the gods, which ends in his death.<br />The second story is called The Healers, and is quite fragmentary and only takes up a page of translated text.<br />The third story is the story Kirta (Keret).  King Kirta is a sort of Job figure who entreats El for children and then receives a dream and instructions.  He follows the instructions of the dream and has children.  However, in the process of carrying out the instructions, he makes a vow to the goddess Asherah which he fails to keep.  Kirta is punished with disease, and the rest of the story is about his ability or inability to be a king (challenged, as he is, by his son).<br />The fourth and final story in Dr. Coogan's book is of the well known Baal cycle, which I will not summarize here.<br />Dr. Coogan provides introductory material to the whole book and to each chapter, and often has an eye to relating the Ugaritic stories to the Hebrew story.  For example, he shows the relation of El to Yahweh, providing ample scriptural references (following through with the OT references is quite enlightening).  Another profitable discussion is where he shows the connection of Mt. Zaphon (the abode of Baal) and the usage of Zaphon and mountain imagery in the Hebrew Scriptures.  I suggest that even further study on this matter should lead one to Dr. Meredith G. Kline's 1996 article which, in part, traces the usage of Mt. Zaphon in Isaiah: &quot;Har Magadon: The End of the Millennium&quot; Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society #39 (June 1996): pp 207-222.<br />Dr. Coogan writes from the perspective of the Harvard school of L. Stager, E. Bloch-Smith, etc., which is not intimidated by the minimalist schools, and therefore not afraid to locate the Hebrew ideas in the context of Canaan.  Thus, this short and accessible book is a handy guide for students of Israel and the Bible.king (challenged, as he is, by his son). <br />The fourth and final story in Dr. Coogan's book is of the well known Baal cycle, which I will not summarize here. <br />Dr. Coogan provides introductory material to the whole book and to each chapter, and often has an eye to relating the Ugaritic stories to the Hebrew story.

Do you read arduously and slowly?  Do you use simple words because you are afraid of mispronouncing the better word you are thinking of?  Do you forget peoples names easily?  Are you a poor speller?  Where you in remedial reading as a child?  Are you creative and do you think outside of the box?  All of these things may mean that Shaywitzs book is for you.<br />This book explains what dyslexia is, how to spot it in yourself and you children, and ways to help a child who has it.  Educators and parents would do well to read this book and have a working knowledge of the issues at stake; lifelong patterns of frustration and low self-esteem can be averted when a responsible educator can spot and understand dyslexia in a child.<br />Adults with dyslexia are not given solutions in the book, per se, but are directed to important resources.  For example, Thumbprint Mysteries are recommended for adults with dyslexia (books available on Amazon). In this respect, Overcoming Dyslexia differs from other books on the subject, such as \\"The Gift of Dyslexia\\" which provide exercises to assist the adult learner.<br />The first few chapters of the book demonstrate how dyslexia can be clinically diagnosed. Any of you who know or sense that you have dyslexia, know the frustration of having a disadvantage that can not be diagnosed.  Shaywitz points to solid scientific research (brain scans and MRIs) which illustrate the reality of dyslexia.<br />The epilogue will be quite encouraging to anyone who has dyslexia and who wants to read the testimonies of famous and brilliant people who have also suffered with it.  When I read this section, I felt like I was connecting with a secret society of friends who all shared the same feelings and setbacks I had lived with all my life.  That good and intelligent people can struggle with the same thing I fight with makes for a sight of hope.  Dyslexic thinkers can be quite creative as one part of their brain has been trained to compensate for the lack in another.<br />This book is a wonderful tool, I hope many will find it and use it.ght of hope.

James Breasted, Prof. at University of Chicago back when the university first started, rose from humble beginnings in small-town Illinois up to scholarly studies in Germany and then head of important exploration work in Egypt.<br />The hurdles James had to jump in order to gain his degree in Germany came at no small cost to himself or his family.  Then, in order to establish his American career, he had to fight even harder against peer-scholars and university bureaucracy, both of which made his professional life intolerable.  One can add to his uphill struggles the rampant apathy generated by his unknown field (the fruit of which at that time was yet un-tasted by the public or by the American academic humanity school).  After reading this biography, one is left wondering how in the world the American endeavor to participate in Egyptology ever made it off the ground.<br />While reading, one comes to feel the frustration of the underpaid scholar--too brilliant for the pigmies that surrounded him--who had to fight every obstacle that man or demon could throw his way.  Friends, charlatans, governments, competitors, treasure hunters, scholars, politics, university staff, and nature itself all sought to work ill for him; yet he prevailed and published works that are still standard to this day.  I am here thinking of his 5 volume &quot;Ancient Records of Egypt&quot; which systematically record and translate all the inscriptions he could find in Egypt (a work still unmatched)!  Interestingly, even this monumental accomplishment was sour to him, as he was betrayed in the funding to publish it, and then when it was published, the Univ. of Chicago changed the dedication page.  Originally dedicated to his dear dear father (who gave his very life to fund James' education at Yale and in Germany and so make the books possible), the University changed the dedication to name three strangers James knew not.  Furthermore, when they finally did publish his manuscript, the printers cut out his margins--filled as they were with additional and important scholarly notations.  The printers then disposed of these significant additions (a loss that sent him into depression).  This, however, is but one account of all the undermining works with which he had to cope.  It was with great pain and sorrow that James Breasted accomplished all that he did in his life.<br />The accounts of his expeditions are harrowing; his failures are painful, his successes are staggering, and his intellect is awe-inspiring.  His son has provided us rich treasure that only he--himself learned and well traveled with his dad--could show.<br />A delightful theme that plays through the book is the commentary on James' wife and Charles' mother; she was the Victorian clad camel cargo, volcano climber, rapids rider and emotionally needy woman. According to current prevailing and popular notions, James does not come across as the ideal husband or father in this biography--it is not long in the book before one starts to feel sad for his whole family.  Charles leaves us with the impression that James' busy mind often carried him mentally away to Egypt, making him unable to engage his family recreationally, even while present with them physically.<br />All in all, this book is a well told tale. Indiana Jones does not live up to real heroic efforts of James Breasted; Dr. Breasted's challenges were far more complex and challenging than any Hollywood has portrayed. Reality, in the case of James Henry Breasted, is more compelling than fiction!mes' education at Yale and in Germany and so make the books possible), the University changed the dedication to name three strangers James knew not.

US	51315014	R2BAHONYZIACB6	0801022010	249134724	The Gods of the Nations: Studies in Ancient Near Eastern National Theology (Evangelical Theological Society.)	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Yahweh in the context of the Ancient Near East	Dr. Block takes us on a tour of the Ancient Near East, comparing Israel and Yahweh to the neighboring gods and religions.<br />Using this book, one will be able to gain a working familiarity with some of the more common religious thought forms of the Bronze and Iron ages.  A major conclusion of his work is that Yahweh is distinct from all the other gods in that he cares for a people while all the other gods care only for their lands.  Yahweh is the electing God of love and mercy.<br />For gaining a better understanding of the Old Testament world, books such as this are indispensable.  Block is a master teacher who knows how to systematically present ancient texts and beliefs.  In the end he arrives at a profound restatement of Yahweh and His relation to Israel, resulting in a summary exposition of Ezekiel 8-11. In that text we discover how the Glory of Yahweh leaves the temple and heads east to leave Jerusalem and depart from Israel.  This movement is explained in the Babylonian context where gods often leave temples when they are dragged away by captors.  Yahweh, however, is unique in that his departure is voluntary and under his own power, for he is doing with the other gods can not and do not do.  My summary can not do justice, you really need to get the book and read all the details for yourself.<br />The book is divided into five basic chapters that can each be read in one sitting.  As a result, I found myself reading this book in less than a week -- and with little effort, which is good for me being that I am slowest of all readers. That is, I did not find myself spending all my free time reading, but the pages evaporated into the past as quickly as they appeared: the reading was over before I realized what hit me.<br />I have spent a good amount of time reading Ancient Near Eastern material, and I feel like this treaties has been the most pleasant and enjoyable.  One critique I would give, which is really a wish and not a critique, is that it would be nice if there were a chapter on the New Testament.  I would like to see Block develop his theme in relation to Jesus, who is the Lord of the New Exodus.  Jesus is the \\"Yahweh-Saves\\" Man, and it would be wonderful to see how Block would incorporate this into his overall scheme (in my mind, the idea is perfectly complimentary to Blocks present thesis, and Id like to read the good professors take on the matter).  Where Block does not develop the theme, I recommend reading \\"God Crucified\\" by Richard Bauckham (available on Amazon), or \\"The Challenge of Jesus\\" by N.T. Wright, esp. chapter 5, also available on Amazon.if there were a chapter on the New Testament.  I would like to see Block develop his theme in relation to Jesus, who is the Lord of the New Exodus.

This is the first point lost when we try to think of Moses in terms of his management skills.  Furthermore, Moses as a covenant head corresponds to Jesus as covenant head of a better covenant. Jesus intimates this sort of thing in Luke 24:27 where, \\"beginning with Moses\\" he told the disciples how all of the OT scriptures point to him.<br />The story of Moses is preparing us for Jesus, the One mediator who performs the true exodus (freeing his people from sin and death -- a power-set that is far more sinister than the Pharaoh!). The story of Moses is a part of the larger story of redemption; it is the story of God working out his salvation-will in the world in preparation for Jesus.  To think about Moses in terms of management leadership lessons is to do harm to the real story that is taking place -- the freeing of humanity from the death-sin existence initiated by our first covenant head, Adam (by the way, Paul in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 calls Jesus the last Adam!).<br />Just as Moses took the people through water (the Red sea) and into the desert, so Jesus passes through the water of baptism on his way to be tempted by Satan in the wilderness (Matt 4). Just as Moses and Israel were 40 years in the desert, so Jesus was 40 days in the desert.  Where Israel failed in their desert wilderness, Jesus succeeded (he overcame the temptations of the Devil).  Jesus is the faithful Israel, and does what Moses and the people of God under the Cloud could not do.  Moses himself was not permitted to enter the Promised Land because of his sin, whereas Jesus has entered the very presence of Yahweh because of his life of perfection (one might say that Jesus is the better Moses).<br />When we talk this way, we get closer to the idea of Moses than a book on \\"Moses as CEO\\" or \\"Moses as Model Leader.\\"  The real story of Moses suffers when its retelling is management focused.<br />I should mention, Moses did things that would discredit any leader of our day. He had Israel destroy the Midanites and take the women captive (see Numbers 31:1-18).  Worse, modernly speaking, he had Israel [do away with] all the women captives that the men of Israel slept with.  Not only that, he had Israel [do away with] all the male children of these killed women (yikes!) -- see Numbers 31:17.  Now, obviously there is something theological going on here that transcends leadership-management models.  If Moses is the greatest Manager of all time, then what should we do with managers who order the slaughter of used women and their children?<br />Obviously when we look at Moses as a management example, we risk skewing what is really happening in ancient Israel.  Moses does not fit the model of a moral leader as we would define it (cf. Numbers 31 again), and so this book is a distraction to the real story of the Bible.<br />If one wants leadership lessons, that's fine, but don't use Moses out of context to do it. If one wants lesson on Moses, that's fine too, but don't use modern management categories as an interpretive grid.  Let's leave Moses to the history of redemption and try to understand him on his own terms (standing as he is on the cosmic stage of salvation history). I don't think I am venturing too far when I say that Moses himself would have been perplexed by the modern mind that thinks of him in the small category of \\"Management.\\"<br />As you read Baron's book, keep this critique in mind.

To do so, I must begin with a review of near recent history, going back to a time when a large sector of Christianity responded to the Enlightenment with what is known as \\"Protestant Liberalism.\\"<br />The Enlightenment was a movement that, in part, argued that only the verifiable is true -- meaning that the Bible is invalid in some of its details, and in such cases non-relevant for the rational mind. For example, Enlightenment reason dictates that miracles are beyond the scope of reality, and so an accusation of impracticality and mythology is leveled against the Bible. Protestant Liberalism answered this charge by explaining away the non-rational elements of Scripture; relegating such to the sphere of faith (as opposed to historical fact).  My main point is that Protestant Liberalism was (and is) a movement with a goal to make the Bible relevant to the post-Enlightenment world.  Unfortunately, in its quest for a Christianity relevant to the rational mind, Protestant Liberalism continued to use the language of orthodox Christianity, hiding the fact that it was redefining the meaning behind the terms;  Protestant Liberalism kept the vernacular of Christianity and filled it up with new meaning.  So, for example, when a Protestant Liberal thinks of Christmas, despite her confessed belief in Jesus she is not accepting the idea of a historical virgin birth -- she instead is celebrating the shared feeling of faith among those who enjoy the idea of a Jesus (after all, virgins don't give birth, yet Christmas is still a wonderful holiday!).  Thus, not willing to give up Christmas, nor willing to accept the notion of miracles, Protestant Liberalism makes Jesus relevant to all comers, and one need not believe that he was actually virgin born to have a valid Christmas faith experience.  That's a sketch of Protestant Liberalism.<br />My point in this historical survey is that the current movement to make the Bible relevant is, at the core, no different than Protestant Liberalism.  Books like the one under review here use the words of Christianity, but for far different purposes than the original scriptures intended.  The goal of this book, like that of the writings of Protestant Liberals, is to make the Bible relevant (for coaching sports teams, for running businesses, for . . .) and so represents a repackaging of Liberalism.  To embrace the precepts of this book, one must buy into the notion that the Bible must be made relevant (with the unstated implication being \\"else the Bible is not so relevant\\").  Relevance is a thing unto itself, and is that which most appeals to the modern mind, especially in such areas as running a company,  coaching a soccer team, etc.  Just as Protestant Liberalism catered to the Enlightenment mind, so books like this cater to the 21st century Leadership-Relevance mind.<br />Over and against this book, and others like it, is the apostle Paul who assures us that the Bible is foolishness to those who are earthly minded (wise according to the world). The Bible does not work as a manual for leadership, and can not be so reduced.<br />It is based on this analysis that I can say that Lorin Woolfe has \\"Americanized\\" Christianity and fostered a different religion, one which unfortunately uses some of the words as orthodox Christianity.<br />And now I quote the Scriptures to demonstrate how the world of the Bible is not compatible with the Bible-as-leadership-model that Woolfe envisions.  In the following text from Psalm 137:9, the Psalmist is writing about the destruction of Babylon, and says this to them of their demise:<br />\\"Happy shall he be, that takes and dashes your little ones against the stones.\\"  KJV<br />I pick this text because it does not fit a modern leadership model -- for which leader among us would advocate satisfaction over the death of little ones?  This verse should illustrate how out-of-touch the modern leadership literature is when it tries to make the Bible \\"relevant.\\"  Dashing babies on stones is hardly relevant to any coaching or CEO model I would want to be a part of!  So what does Woolfe do when he comes across such modernly-distasteful texts?  He does what Protestant Liberalism has always done, he leaves them out of the discussion for the sake of the modern person who finds the text distasteful; he edits the Bible for the sake of reaching the modern need, a need which knows nothing of dashing little ones against stones.  My conclusion is that the Psalmist must have missed Woolfe's conference on how to be a good leader, else he never would have written such a horrific psalm.ittle ones?

To propel his discussion of celestial bodies, he uses the fuel of such stories as:<br /><br />* Einstein's theory of relativity as vindicated by an Eclipse<br />* Alexander's defeat of Darius the day after an eclipse in 331 BC.<br />* The bible's use of moon language, speaking of days where the moon will be darkened (some kind of eclipse?)<br /><br />With facts like this, Steel keeps us following a provocative discussion of the moon and its cycles.  The history lessons are interspersed with scientific facts so that after a while one doesn't know if he is reading a history book or a science novel.<br /><br />As the author points out, the Eclipse as a phenomena in the sky held special cultic meaning for the Ancient Near Eastern religions (esp. the Egyptians). But one is left wondering if Steel is accurate at all points of history.  For example, when arguing from the Bible about supposed eclipse accounts therein, he sees the story Abraham as alluding to one, \\"And when the sun was going down...great darkness fell upon him.\\"  Because he sees this text as an eclipse, he dates the time of Abraham to 9 May 1533 BC 6:30pm.  What is interesting in this is that there is an actual internet database maintained by NASA that allows the author (and us!) to track all eclipses for all time.  Indeed, there was an eclipse visible in Jerusalem in 1533, but does that mean that the text in question is talking about an eclipse? Steel may be misreading the biblical data, but it is only a small distraction from his great book.<br /><br />It should be noted, Steel's book is not only about the moon, but about all of the celestial bodies and man's reaction to their appearances (Mars, comets, famous meteor storms, etc.).<br /><br />This book is a good introduction for the novice about such things as \\"blue moons\\", \\"the diamond ring\\" affect, eclipses in general, the calendar and the moon, and other such relevant topics.<br /><br />I first heard of Duncan Steel when he was interviewed on NPR in June of 2002; the audio of that was once available on the internet.erviewed on NPR in June of 2002; the audio of that was once available on the internet.	2003-04-05

Did the water level rise from ancient times, submerging ancient cities three to four hundred feet below sea level (or even deeper)?<br /><br />I like to think of myself as a semi-astute reader, but no amount of words will make me believe such a grand hypothesis without photographs (after all, the camera is a simply technology for underwater investigators, so the evidence should be easy to produce!).  If there are ancient cities under the sea, then I want to see the ruins.  Hancock does not show us.  The few pictures he does show are murky and uncertain at best.  If I was going to write a book like this, I'd take a ton of pictures from multiple angles and prove that what I found was real.  Not so with Hancock.  I wonder why?  Oh, I know, it's because his theory is make-believe.<br />This book is long on words and short on the real kind of evidence that would prove his fantasy case.  In short, this book is a full-length tabloid.  I can think of some people who will think Hancock is a master, just like they believe the U.S. never landed on the moon. Buyer beware.	2003-04-04

This book hit the spot, and the examples saved me.<br />Chartrand uses applications from every field of interest (e.g. finance, Chemistry, Physics, games, social psychology, computers, etc.)  Who would have thought that while reading a math book that a friendly discussion of social psychology would pop-up?  Well, that's how Chartrand is able to keep us moving through the pages; he uses the common to reveal the mysteries of Graph Theory. Who doesn't know about the Tower of Hanoi or the Knight's Tour or the one-boat-fox-and-chickens problems? All of these classics make for ready connecting points, leading us into profound restatements of well-known problems.  Not much space is devoted to creating artificial problems for which we must be convinced need solving, and so the book is rather thin (a real bonus for those of us who don't want to spend a month in a math book).<br />Picking up the book after having read it so long ago, I was happy to find that the chapters are nearly autonomous and can be profitably read by themselves -- so keep it as a reference and jump in as the need arises, you'll be both entertained and mathematically illumined.<br />My only complaint is that the writing style is rather thick with mathematical lingo (seemingly) for the sake of being technically pithy.  I am not convinced that such is necessary for a good math book.	2003-04-04

This book is not full of chess notations and complex lines that need to played out on a board.  This book is better than that, for it teaches us from a sky-level view -- showing us how to look at the board in order to find and exploit imbalances.  This book is about chess vision, and after working through only a few of the chapters I saw improvements in my game.<br />As an example of what this book delivers, I now know how to think about knights vs. bishops (something before I had never considered).  The author demonstrates how when playing against someone with just knights that one goal is to exploit that imbalance by taking away all the advanced squares for those knights.  Simple! -- why didn't I think of that before?  The book is full of such advice, and the author arrives at his conclusions by taking us through the thoughts of actual armature players.<br />Each game is the author vs. amateur, and recorded for us is what the amateur was thinking between each major move (and then the experts analysis of those thoughts). This method of teaching makes for a truly useful chess book; I found myself thinking like the amateurs and then immediately being corrected by the master.  Wonderful book, I could not put it down (the only chess book I can say that of).	2003-04-04

Where the standard CS textbooks are most stale, Dewdney is the most provocative.  He illuminates the dark corners of abstract thought with practical puzzles and plain language.  This book is written in small bite size chapters that grow in complexity around multiple ideas, one being the idea of the state machine (if you don't know what a state machine is, don't fret, Dewdney is here to help).  For us programmers, he gives enough information to actually implement the algorithms and explore the universe he envisions.  I was able to take two of his pages and use it as a coding exercise that turned out to be quite enjoyable.<br />The appeal to Dwedney and his book stems from the fact that everything he writes is game-like or puzzle-oriented; while reading him one gets the feeling that an enlightened child is guiding the learned to a new level of thinking.  Dewdney takes Computer Science on an enjoyable walk through a park where he ends up teaching the discipline to rethink shortest paths and non-intersecting traversals.  What's more amazing about this book is that it is perfectly suited for a coffee table where the uninitiated could accidentally pick it up and join the conversation. That is, a degree in computer science is not a prerequisite to this fascinating read.  It is brain dessert.	2003-04-01

Egypt was briefly ruled from this location by Pharaoh Amenhotep IV (1352 - 1336 B.C. 18th Dynasty). Amenhotep, meaning &quot;Amon is satisfied&quot;, took on the name Akhenaton, &quot;he who is serviceable to Aton&quot;, when he exalted Aton by making the cult of the sun disc the primary religion of Egypt. Under Akenaton the capital city of Egypt was moved from Thebes to Akhetaton, &quot;the horizon of Aton.&quot;<br />This new capital city was later abandoned by Tutankhamen when Egypt returned to her old orthodoxy. Akhetaton was never re-occupied in any significant way, and in her ruins were found hundreds of administrative documents known as the Amarna tablets (the first batch found in 1887 by locals).  These cuneiform (wedge-writing) tablets are, primarily, communications from Asiatic kings to Egypt.<br />Moran has done a superb job in giving the English speaking world access to the Amarna letters.  To my knowledge, this book is the first single volume collection of these important letters in English! Moran is to be thanked.<br />Among other things, these letters are useful to the historian for studies of Canaan during the Israel conquest period.  For example, the letters are full of requests for help from Canaanite kings to Egypt concerning a mysterious people called the ha-BI-ru (Hebrews?).  Note: To assist us in reading these letters in terms of the ha-Bi-ru and their relationship to Israel, we have three informative articles by M. G. Kline published in the Westminster Theological Journal in issues 18, 19 and 20.  He concludes that the ha-Bi-ru are a &quot;scourge employed by Yahweh to chastise the Israelites for their failure to prosecute the mandate of conquest.&quot;<br />From Moran's work, other Biblical connections await the careful reader.  For example, in reading one of the letters, I came across the phrase referring to the realm of the &quot;Great King&quot; as existing &quot;from the rising of the Sun to its setting.&quot;  Which is an idea that shows up almost word for word in Malachi and one of the Psalms.  If I were industrious, I could work on the underlying languages to see if the connection is valid; at this point I should note that the Amarna letters are available on the internet in transliterated form -- produced by Shlomo Izre'el and located on the Tel Aviv University web site.  This simple example, however, should give one an idea of the potential of Moran's work for the non-specialist (of which I am one).<br />Outside of Biblical studies, the Amarna letters provide a rare glimpse of Egypt in her relations with vassals, allies and enemies.  The letters are not only informative, but even entertaining at times as we get to see kings wrangling over gift-wives and diplomatic miscues.<br />In the first section, Moran gives an introduction to the history of the letters and the site itself.  However, for a more readable introduction, see Pfeiffer's, Tell El Amarna and the Bible.<br />For the specialists, Moran has provided technical footnotes throughout; his translations are defended where needed. All in all, this book seems indispensable to anyone who would want to investigate the Amarna tablets (from the casual historian to the advanced linguist).&quot;from the rising of the Sun to its setting.&quot;  Which is an idea that shows up almost word for word in Malachi and one of the Psalms.

The second article is on Ebla and the Amorites. The third article, which seems oddly out of place, is on Ebla and a piece of database software that was written to help in evaluating the language. This article by Buccellati reads rather like a computer software manual and a requirements document. Worse, after reading the article, one is left wondering where to get their hands on the database (which, as far as I can tell, is not available -- 10 years later). After a little bit of searching, I did find that one of Bucellati's students, Joseph Pagan, has published a PhD which comes with a disk and an Ebla database. The database with Pagan's dissertation appears to contain a list of names found on the tablets.<br />Gary Rendsburg ends this collection with a study on a Hebrew cognate word related to a yellow bird.<br />The Ebla tablets will not be as helpful as they can be (for Biblical studies) until more scholars publish translations and articles.

Ebla is an ancient city of Syria dating to the Early Bronze age -- ~2400 B.C. In the 1970s an Italian excavation team discovered 7000 cuneiform tablets (busted into about 15000 pieces) in this ancient city. The Ebla tablets contain a new language, and are relevant to Biblical studies for their linguistic ties to Hebrew. Sadly, the publication of the Ebla tablets in translation (English translation) has been slow going -- instead of a book of translated tablets, we have these fine volumes at our disposal. This volume is a collection of technical essays (not all in English) on Ebla and the tablets. Some of the highlights of this book include an article on the gods of Canaan, a discussion of Northwest Semitic studies, and a paper by I. M.

The authors are interested in using the latest archaeological data to shed light on the Scriptures (see, for example, King's earlier commentary on Jeremiah).  It will take time for all of the information in this book to make it into popular biblical commentaries (it is cutting edge information, as the authors themselves are active archaeologists).  This book is a concentrated collection of journal quality insights written at a popular level.<br />Before I bought this book, I heard one of the co-authors (Dr. Stager of Harvard) lecture on his contribution to the book. He is a master investigator of the ancient near eastern ideas of temple and garden. Stager brilliantly communicates how Israel's Temple and Garden Story relate to (and are informed by) their original contexts.

Divorce is allowed only on the grounds of broken marriage vows [including lack of love, food, or proper material care], and the decisions to divorce can be made only by the injured party.  A believer should never break the marriage vows, and should try to forgive a repentant partner who has done so.  If divorce does happen, remarriage is permitted.  All this would be obvious to a 1st-century Jew, but the meaning of the text was obscured at a very early date due to ignorance about Jewish background after 70 C.E.  Modern Church practice can be easily adapted to this insight because our marriage services still preserve the four biblical grounds for divorce in the marriage vows.<br />  The Church should now be humble and admit that a great mistake has been made.  Too many generations of husbands and wives have been forced to remain with their abusing or neglectful partners and have not been allowed to divorce even after suffering repeated unfaithfulness.  The Church should not continue in a false teaching because Church tradition should not be regarded as superior to the teaching of Jesus and Paul\\" p.314<br />I should add that the author has a high view of Scripture, he is a scholar reading the text, and not a man trying to justify divorce.  Furthermore, this book is recommended reading in conservative seminaries, so one should not look at this as a liberal attempt to undermine marriage.  This book is Biblical (though none will agree with all of its interpretations) and accessible.	2003-03-01
US	51315014	R3S69WUKLWOFEN	0306435756	460106232	Approaches to Archaeological Ceramics	Books	4	7	7	N	Y	Chapter by chapter summary	Carla Sinopoli writes with a view to helping the reader \\"consider how ceramics are used to answer specific questions about the past\\" p70.  Though offering a thick treatment of statistical analysis as applied to ceramics (Chapter 3 and the appendix), she is not interested in ceramics for the sake of data analysis but for the building of an ethnoarchaeological picture of the past.  Ceramics are subservient to the task at hand, and as such, the books true strength is in Chapters 4-7 where S. applies the basic principles of Chapters 1-3 to actual field studies.<br />Chapters 1-3 introduce ceramics at their atomic level, starting from material preparation and following through to the completion of a piece of pottery.  As the whole book is grounded in the concrete of showing how ceramics answer specific questions, so S.'s discussion of how pottery is created is also practical.  As such, a high point of Chapter 2 is when S. takes us on a journey through an actual potter's workshop.  By using a model of analogy, she convincingly constructs what the ancient process of pottery making consisted of.  The potter's workshop is a case study from modern Kamalapuram, India.  Based on personal visits there, S. begins at the beginning of how the family passes along the knowledge of pottery making from generation to generation (much as one would expect of the tradesmen of the ANE). From there, she follows through with the actual labor of gathering the materials for making the clay, the task of shaping pottery (using various methods), primitive firing, and finally the trade, commerce and use of the finished pieces. She provides a layout of the workshop, the familial essence of the operation, and the craftsmanship that under girds it all.<br />Chapter 5 tackles the question of using ceramics to answer questions related to cultural uses of ceramics, along with the production and distribution thereof. Part of the problem of ascertaining ceramic usage from the archaeological find is that pottery is not normally found where it was last used, but has a life cycle of being used, being broken and then being deposited.  Therefore, when analyzing sherds, \\"discard behavior and deposition processes must be taken into account\\" p86.  Ceramic assemblages are formed based on complex human behavior.  For example, a piece of pottery created for cooking, once broken, may be employed in such unrelated areas as wall building. Destruction levels are particularly useful to the archaeologists, because it is when destruction comes that pottery is most likely to be left where it was last used. Finding how ceramics are distributed across a site will allow for determining usage patterns.  For doing this, it is important for the historian to obtain some accurate accounting of the frequency of different vessel types throughout the site.  The problem here is that \\"the frequencies of vessel types in an archaeological assemblage is not necessarily a direct reflection of their frequency of use at any one point in time\\" p86.  That is, one must be careful on any conclusions drawn simply from counting types.<br />The goal of Chapter 6 is to \\"consider how to examine social variation in ceramics using archaeological data\\" p124.  A method for attaining this goal is based on \\"the recognition of patterns: consistent association of ceramic classes, spatial clustering within sites, and so on\\" p124.  Ceramical differences among areas within a site, even micro differences in rims and vessel shape, may indicate social differences.  Giving meaning to pottery attributes is not a simple task, as the social function of style is not recorded in the pottery, but is only reflected in the pottery.  Analysis at this level requires a flow of information back and forth between pattern recognition and interpretation.  The process of understanding social meaning in variations should included 1) a theoretical grid by which to filter variability; 2) seeing patterns over the larger set of all data; 3) evaluating patterns over time and space; 4) as necessary, revisiting and updating the interpretive grid.<br />Social, economic and political conditions are all of a piece in complex societies.  Chapter 5 dealt more with the economics of ceramics, Chapter 6 with the social norms expressed in ceramics, and so Chapter 7 takes up the subject of politics and ceramics.  In this chapter, S. deals with the impact of centralized control and production of ceramics, giving three case studies that illustrate the politics of ceramics.  One pattern that emerges is that an increase in central control of a region means increased standardization among vessel forms and quality.  As a case study, S. takes up ceramic production in Oaxaca in Central Mexico.  Eleven periods from 1450 B.C. to A.D. 1520 are discussed, and it is shown how the increase and decrease of centralized political control in those periods is reflected in pottery.  The basic patter is that increased centralization means increased control over pottery production (central sites of production) and an increase in production scale with concomitant standardization of vessels, meaning a reduction in energy per vessel in production along with a decrease in decorative quality.  In contrast, political decentralization meant diversity in pottery with more energy to produce a vessel and more decorative quality.  In a centralized system, fine wares for the elite were the basis of competition among localized producers; the utilitarian products were standardized.<br />I hope this survey is helpful as you try to decide how to spend that all-to-limited book money!ting patterns over time and space; 4) as necessary, revisiting and updating the interpretive grid.<br />Social, economic and political conditions are all of a piece in complex societies.

The prayer of Jabez starts with an \\"if\\" in the original Hebrew and also in the Ancient Greek Old Testament.<br />Jabez was a man who, like Joshua and Sampson, enlarged Israel's holdings in Canaan by military conquest.  Such is the context of his vow-prayer, that God would multiply his territory.  That he was &quot;more honorable than his brothers&quot; is that he was a valiant warrior in the conquest of Canaan (like Joshua).  This \\"warrior\\" context of the word honorable is confirmed in 1 Chron 11:21,25 where men are more honorable due to their fierceness in battle.  For Jabez to be honorable meant that he was a valiant man of Holy War.<br />The vow has a decidedly Abrahamic context.  Abraham was promised Canaan, and now Jabez was obtaining the inheritance.  The word for \\"multiply\\" in the promise made to Abraham is the same word translated \\"enlarge\\" in 1 Chron.  That is, Jabez's vow has the land inheritance promised to Abraham in view.<br />Christians no longer inherit the land of Canaan through military conquest, but they inherit the blessing of Abraham through the Spirit (in fact, Paul in Galatians calls the Spirit the inheritance!).  Jesus has already enlarged the Abrahamic inheritance to its ultimate extent, and now we wait for it to be revealed in glory - when the heavenly realm is united with the Earth in the final new creation.  The land that Jabez wanted to conquer (the Abrahamic Promised Land) was a shadow of the heavenly kingdom that Jesus has already secured (the Real Inheritance which is not of the Law, but Spirit).<br />Thus, the prayer of the Christian is not for enlarged territory, as if Canaan was still our inheritance, but now we have a different prayer, namely:  \\"Come Lord Jesus, Come!\\"  We pray for Jesus to come and consummate that which he has already enlarged beyond measure.<br />The vow of Jabez has a context which the book by Wilkinson must account for if it is going to do justice to the Ancient Near Eastern Israelites who were under the Theocracy and land-conquest edicts.  Jabez was under the same theocracy, and his vow is packed with theocratic implications, especially given the literal Canaan that he helped to cleanse through battle (such battle that today would be condemned by the UN).<br />God granted Jabez his request. In 1 Chronicles 2:55 we find that he had a city named after him, indicating that an inheritance in Israel was his indeed.  To have a city in Israel under the Theocracy was to have a city in the very Kingdom of God.  Jabez was a mighty man of war, honored by God for his zeal in battle, and his place in the Kingdom of God was established.<br />This view of Jabez will be helpful as you read Wilkinson's book and try to determine for yourself if he is using the Old Testament wisely or out of context.r />The vow of Jabez has a context which the book by Wilkinson must account for if it is going to do justice to the Ancient Near Eastern Israelites who were under the Theocracy and land-conquest edicts.

This book gives a list of 5000 things everyone should know.  I have had more fun with this list than I ever imagined.  My friends and I enjoy taking a sample page from the list and seeing how many items we know.  This book is worth the list itself.  The first few chapters are on educational theory, and that is fun too.  If you like this book, you will like Steve Allen's book, &quot;Dumbth, the Lost Art of Thinking with 101 Ways to Better &amp; Improve Your Mind.&quot;  Steve has a similar conclusion as Hirsch, only he adds more humor.<br />Hirsch wrote a companion book to this one that explains all 5000 entries in the list.	2001-11-26

His sermons serve as mini-commentaries on Scripture.  He unfolds the Bible in ever surprising ways, and acts as a fine introduction into the works Meredith G. Kline.	2001-11-26
US	51315014	R3RQMSPZ7GJWMY	1579100694	589627718	The Structure of Biblical Authority	Books	5	32	35	N	Y	Unbelievably fresh insight into the Scriptures.	I read this book in 1999, and it was the best book I read that year.  Kline shows the covenant structure of the Mosaic books.  His contribution to the structure of cannon can not be ignored; the structure of the Torah can not be divorced from its content.<br />One quick insight I learned from this book:<br />The 10 Commandments were treaty documents. There were two tables because there were two copies, one for the Suzerain and one for the Vassal.  Each copy of the treaty document was stored where the two parties would meet, which was at the ark of the covenant.  Kline demonstrates that this is the pattern of the Ancient Near East.<br />Much more could be said about this book;  it's small, but it's packed from front to back.	2001-11-26

When I started studying Greek, I read two standard grammars, then this one.  I never went back to the other two, and I read this one three times.  It is so easy to read, and so unique in its approach, that I don't know why anyone would use any other.  Every college and seminary library I visit uses this grammar -- it is the new standard.  If you use this book, you will not have to memorize near so much as the other grammars require.  After taking eight hours of Greek at seminary, it was obvious to me that I did not know Greek at all, and so I turned to Mounce's book for help.  Mounce's approach is so revolutionary (using morphology), that my previous Greek knowledge had to be scrapped.  I had to start over with Greek, and I can't imagine a better way to learn than with this book.  This is the book to get if you want to learn Greek.	2001-11-26

This books should be standard reading for all ministers and serious bible students.  If you deal with the text of scripture, you will want to deal with Kline.  This book is short and packed.  It is simultaneously brilliant and small.  Kline is an expert in the ancient Near East, and this allows him to untangle heavenly imagery.  This book does not disappoint  Do not read it if you are not ready to be floored...	2001-11-19

Among other things, Vos teaches the differences between Systematic Theology and  Biblical Theology. If you don't know the differences, and you don't know  why they matter, then you will enjoy Vos.<br />In this book Vos raises the bar on what it means to be Reformed. Some disagree with Vos' use of difficult words -- this is a fair complaint, I suppose, but it should encourage us to become better readers, not to leave off reading a great book.  If you do little else in life, read Vos and you will have done much.	1999-08-26
