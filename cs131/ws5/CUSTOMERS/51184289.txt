It's painful when a woman likes a man and he doesn't return the feelings.  I think the authors realize this, and have produced a book that is is honest and surprisingly upbeat.<br /><br />But some day someone needs to write a book when it's the other way around. Sometimes a man likes a woman who doesn't return the favor.  Do we ever see any books about that subject?  (Hey!  Maybe I've got myself a new project!)<br /><br />I guess my biggest problem with the book is that it gives the impression that women think about nothing else but acquiring a husband.  When I was single I thought about marriage a lot, but I also was busy with my work and my many hobbies and interests.  There were lots of fish to fry and I was having a great time.<br /><br />In fact, there were some guys who probably thought I was not into THEM!	2005-05-20

Although I am female, as a child and a teenager I didn't cook much.  When I went to college, I cooked even less.  Then suddenly I was in a position where I was going to have to start cooking meals, and I didn't have a clue of what to do.<br /><br />I discovered this book, and I grabbed it!  Ir was made to order for someone like me.  The instructions were plain, easy to understand, and within two days I was preparing Rock Cornish Game Hen with garlic stuffing!  Not only did I appreciate the recipes, I also appreciated what I found out about cooking in general.<br /><br />I would even recommend the book for experienced cooks.  The recipes taste great and are easy to prepare.<br /><br />Bon apetit!	2004-12-18

But the central message is as true now as it was then.  The church can be a wonderful source of comfort, spiritual guidance and fellowship to Christians.  But unfortunately, there are churches -- some of them seemly \\"mainstream\\" -- that exercise too much authority in the lives of the people who attend them.<br /><br />Ronald Enroth gives a list of red flags to look out for to indicate an abusive church.  For me, one of them stands out strongly:  when a particular person in the church (often, but not always, the pastor) announces him/herself as the channel through which God is working and that obedience to that person is a sign of being truly submitted to God.  Some of them will even go as far as to say that if they are wrong, God can still use that for the ultimate good.<br /><br />Well -- technically, that could be right.  If you'll pardon a cliche, God can and does make lemonade out of lemons all the time.  But nowhere does the Bible teach that we are to deliberately subject our judment, spiritual discernment and independent thinking to another person.<br /><br />Since the book was written over 13 years ago, some of the groups Enroth describes may have changed -- but the warning is still there, and it is good for Christians to be aware that there are people who want to steal away the freedom that Jesus Christ can give.  He explains why this can happen and gives suggestions on how to either avoid it or get out of the abusive situation.<br /><br />This book is at its best when reviewed a lot.	2004-09-10

So I am going with the book, and plan to see the movie again some time.  Part of what attracted me to the book was the Chihuahuah on the cover -- I am the Original Dog Lover.<br /><br />I did not read this book \\"critically.\\"  I read it for fun, entertainment and escape and enjoyed it on all three counts. Elle, the main character, for all of her stylish blondeness, is actually easy to identify with.  Even with drop-dead good looks, money and sense of style, she has to deal with the breakup with her boyfriend (no amount of money can make that stop hurting) and challenges in law school, complicated by the fact that since she is attractive, blonde and a former Homecoming Queen, she has people questioning her seriousness and intelligence.<br /><br />The plot is good and kept me turning pages, even though I had seen the end of the movie and knew how it would turn out.  The \\"heavy\\" in the book -- Elle's former boyfriend, Warner -- gets his comeuppance and in all, it's a satisfying book to read.<br /><br />It also pointed out something a lot of people don't realize:  just because a girl is interested in styles, clothing and shopping, it doesn't mean that she's an airhead.<br /><br />I suppose Amanda Brown has a style of writing that could be classed as \\"better than some and weaker than others.\\"  For my part,I think she painted up a real and genuine personality with Elle. There may have been some weaknesses in the book, but to be honest, I wasn't looking for them.  I am neither a law student nor a lawyer, but I do have a busy and scattered-out schedule and sometimes I want to read something that is funny and relaxing.<br /><br />Read the book!  You'll enjoy it!	2004-08-30

I got hooked onto Dr. Manuel Smith's approach to assertiveness training over 27 years ago when I read his book WHEN I SAY NO I FEEL GUILTY.  And one day, many years later, I was browsing through the shelves of the library of a nearby small town and found this gem.  He had taken the assertiveness techniques and fashioned them for the use of children!<br /><br />The techniques came out the same, even though modified for children.  He wisely pointed out that unlike adults, who find commercial situations easiest to practice assertive techniques and \\"close\\" relationships the hardest, with children it is often the other way around -- because children's  \\"commercial\\" relationships usually involve adults (more of an authority relationship). So he suggests that children practice the assertive techniques on their peers first.<br /><br />Dr. Smith is very astute in his observation that teaching children to be \\"good children\\" (i.e., people pleasers) doesn't always help them become effective adults later on.  He encourages the teaching of the verbal techniques of assertion training when when the child reaches about severn years old.<br /><br />A side benefit of this book is for the adult who teaches his/her child these techniques. The adult learns them as well! Contrary to what many think about assertion, it is not \\"aggression,\\" even if the two words rhyme.  It is about teaching children to deal with problems as they really are and to not let someone else manipulate them by making them feel foolish, anxious, or ignorant.  It also helps the children to express what they really want without manipulating others themselves.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book, Dr. Smith reports on the success of the Irvine school system when they began to teach students these techniques through their PLUS and STAR system. The behavior of the students as well their grades improved as a result.<br /><br />The only down side to the book: it's out of print. I'd like to see it back on the shelves of bookstores, and I'd like to see other school districts do what the Irvine district did.<br /><br />I wish this book had been around when I was younger!the shelves of bookstores, and I'd like to see other school districts do what the Irvine district did. <br /> <br />I wish this book had been around when I was younger!	2004-08-10
US	51184289	R65KAEAK8OIT7	0970299605	267296222	2: When I Say No I Feel Guilty, Vol. II, for Managers and Executives	Books	5	9	9	N	Y	Useful and practical	Dr. Manuel J. Smith takes the assertive principles laid down in his national best-seller WHEN I SAY NO I FEEL GUILTY and applies them to the work and business world.  He shows conflicts from the viewpoint of both the employer and employee, from worker to manager alike.  It's not about bullying people to get our own way but rather about making your needs known and working through the problems that are bound to come up in any shop or office.<br /><br />I particularly like his definition of \\"manipulation:\\"  it is when people try to reduce our ability to be our own judge, especially by trying to make us feel guilty, anxious or ignorant.  He then gives some verbal techniques to help us handle ourselves while making our needs known.<br /><br />The value of this book goes far beyond the office or factory.  I read a lot of inspirational and self-help books, and this is one that I read over a lot of times to reinforce the principles.  Contrary to a popular misunderstanding of assertiveness, it does not have to make us meaner or more aggressive -- at times it can even make us nicer, since we don't have to resort to aggression and meanness to get what we want.<br /><br />Even if you haven't read WHEN I SAY NO I FEEL GUILTY, you will still finish this book knowing exactly what Dr. Smith is talking about.  As mentioned in another review on this page, a lot of the material in this book is covered in his (unfortunately) out of print book YES, I CAN SAY NO which aims at teaching assertive principles to children. So if you have that one, some of what is in this one would be a bit (but not completely) repititious.  However, this book is a valuable resource for how to act on the job, and I can't recommend it highly enough for us \\"grown kids.\\"	2004-08-10

I haven't checked the date when this book first came out, but I know it was over 25 years ago.  And yet, it is still up to date and just as helpful as when I read it the first time.<br /><br />Dr. Manuel Smith approaches assertiveness in a behavioral way, basing it on the Assertive Bill of Rights -- what each person can claim as his/her internal rights.  He lists ten of these.  Then he lists seven verbal techniques we can use to interact effectively with other people -- with special emphasis on dealing with people who try to get us to do things we don't want to do or to quit doing things we like to do.<br /><br />This is not a book about controlling other people -- it's about self control.  If we read it carefully and thoroughly process what it says, we also find that it has nothing to do with agression. It also doesn't \\"guarantee\\" that we'll always get what we want, but it does emphasize that we can often better the odds of either getting what we want or working out a compromise.  And Dr. Smith points out that using the assertive verbal techniques in a sarcastic way is counter productive.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find that it also helps deal with potential nasty social situations -- having your clothing, lifestyle or other personal matters insulted at parties (they're supposed to be FUN?)or other gatherings.  As a somewhat sensitive person, I wish I could have read this book as a teenager.<br /><br />But, it's never too late!	2004-08-08

When I was nine years old and in fourth grade (never mind how long ago that was) I found THE BOXCAR CHILDREN when the Bookmobile came to our school.  I checked it out and started reading it, and couldn't put it down.<br />About two weeks ago I decided to read it again.  I was still taken in and charmed by its ease of reading and its very well-written plot.<br />It's about four orphaned children who have to fend for themselves and they find and old boxcar in the woods and they use it for shelter and manage to survive -- surprisingly well.  The ending is happy, but for the young reader, the plot can keep them on edge until the story is over.<br />Some might criticize this book as being \\"dated,\\" but I have found that a good story will come through in spite of the chronological time in which it happenned.  For myself, I found it fun and refreshing to read.  Things STILL can turn out well.<br />I'll make a guess that parents who read this story to their children will enjoy it as much as the kids do!	2004-06-11

Each person goes into a sanctuary like building to spend time with &quot;The Listener.&quot;<br />I won't tell you who &quot;The Listener&quot; is.  You might guess, and you might not.  But one thing I can guarantee -- your life won't be the same after you read this book.  You can be Catholic, Protestant (with all the variations therein) or even a Hindu, Moslem or Jew, and be challenged by reading this book.<br />Through these 15 stories, Taylor Caldwell expresses more about the real essence of Christianity than all of the &quot;Doctrinal&quot; books I have read -- and as a PK (preacher's kid) I've read a lot of them.  This describes more than a &quot;religion.&quot;  It is a relationship with the real originator of Christianity.<br />We have a lot of garbage being promoted in the name of religion today -- and a lot of it is in the name of religion, and trying to be carried out politically.  It's easy to forget that Jesus Christ Himself was notoriously apolitical.  He was about REAL spirituality -- something that starts in the innermost part of a person and spreads outward.<br />The message of this beautiful book is as important today as it was when it was written.  The fact that circumstances and cultures have changed is irrelevant -- human nature hasn't changed at all.<br />Read this story.  It will be among the most worthwhile time you've spent.	2004-06-04

As often happens, these two temperamentally different people become friends.<br />I will not go through the entire story here; others already have, and besides -- I think the reader should do it for him/herself!  However, I think that its strength lies in the realistic portrayal of adolescent friendship in both the positive and negative sense.  At a time when female friendships are being dissected and examined, this book shows that male friendships are no walk in the park, either.<br />Many themes are dealt with here -- reaction to war, uncertainty about the future, the treatment of people perceived as &quot;weaker,&quot; but through the story runs the relationship of Gene and Finny.<br />This is a book that is studied a lot in high school, but is worth reading again as an adult.  We may wonder how much we have REALLY grown up!	2004-05-30

And now that Chalabi, (whom I suspected of being a phony right from the start) is in the political doghouse, this book -- written in 2003 -- is even more thought provoking.<br />Because of my predisposition to depression, I don't always follow the news as closely as I could.  However, I do listen and read it often, and from the news itself and comments I've heard from others, I had a stinky feeling that something was askew in the way this war had -- and still is -- been promoted. And reading WEAPONS OF MASS DECEPTION put names and specific events to something I suspected all along.<br />I leave it to the reader to actually read the book and come to his/her own conclusions.<br />I appreciated this book because it doesn't smack of partisan politics.  There is an objectivity about it that seems missing in a lot of other works like this one.  Some things that stood out for me were the following:<br />1.  The authors question the current administration's methods of promoting the war through advertising and opinion spinning and the use of &quot;evidence&quot; that was questionable at best and false at worst.<br />2.  The book avoided two extremes.  First of all, it avoided the conservatives' blind patriotism.  Second, it avoided the equally wrong view that some (not all) liberals take:  that of blaming the United States for every ill in the world.<br />3.  The book did not try to whitewash the Middle East and give the impression that we were picking on an innocent and sinless society.  It pointed out some very real wrongs that happen there, and it didn't try to whitewash Saddam Hussein, either.  Instead, I feel that the authors wanted us to see the problem for what it IS and not for what it ISN'T.<br />4.  It pointed out something that we all know has been going on for a long time -- that the United States, in its often misguided effort to protect democracy, frequently aligns itself with countries who have abysmal human rights records.<br />5.  The authors did not present this media deception as a strictly American phenomenon.  They looked with realistic eyes at other countries and other times of history to show that this happens in other places and eras, too -- even giving Alexander the Great as an example.<br />In my humble opinion, it's time for the United States to stop trying to police the world and to be its &quot;conscience,&quot; especially in light of the Iraqui prisoner abuse scandal.  I am an American citizen and am grateful for it, but I don't believe that we as a nation are any more &quot;righteous&quot; or &quot;unrighteous&quot; than any other country.  We're a country of human beings with all the human strengths and weaknesses.

It is basically a &quot;how to&quot; on living in the present moment, a practice which most of the world's religions would approve of.<br />I am not a student of either Hinduism or Bhuddism (although I do plan to read the Bhagvad Ghita this year) but I think that Tolle has been deeply affected by both approaches.  But he also has been influenced by A COURSE IN MIRACLES and by Christianity.  I feel that the strength of his work is that he has drawn some principles on which most of these religions would agree.  Although I'm not sure I see eye to eye with his overall view of God, there is a lot of good, practical wisdom on how to live in the now.<br />One of the frustrations of my childhood was that I was always told to &quot;trust&quot; and to &quot;believe&quot; but was never told HOW to do it.  Perhaps everyone needs to learn it for themselves -- but I found the ideas put forth by Eckhart Tolle to be very helpful.  And as a natural born worry wart, I've found that his book gave a lot of helpful ideas.<br />He cautions us not to put our identity in our minds -- thus trying to make the mind do for us what it was never intended to do.  He encourages to be &quot;silent watchers&quot; of the our thoughts and behavior, and to stop investing the mind with &quot;selfness.&quot;  He also encourages us to connect with our &quot;inner body&quot; and to use the body as another way to connect to the &quot;now.&quot;<br />This of course just scratches the surface of what Tolle teaches.  It is a valuable work that will help you improve your relationship to yourself and to others.	2004-05-25

But Gil Alexander-Moeggerle has done his critique, and I found that this book has answered some uneasy feelings I had for a long time -- especially after Dobson became so deeply entrenched into right wing politics.<br />I will not re-hash the book here. Previous reviews have shown the outline of the book, the topics covered, etc., as well as being able to look inside parts of the book here on Amazon.<br />However, I will share some problems I began having as I followed his ministry more.  When I first started reading Dobson's books, I appreciated his views on the development of children and some of his practical psychological wisdom.  However, my misgivings began to crystalize into two categories.<br />1.  Political involvement.  Now please understand -- I have no problem with Christians being involved in politics.  But I do have serious issues with the following:<br />  a.  Legislating so-called \\"Christian principles.\\"  As a religion, Christianity is to be accepted by individuals, not by imposing its principles into law by decree.  The Christian faith cannot be spread by imposing it onto others.<br />  b.  Although I am pro-family, pro-business and pro-life, I don't believe that the \\"conservative\\" camp exclusively owns these issues.<br />  c.  Furthermore, you don't have to be politically conservative to be a Christian.<br />  d.  I am a straight married woman, but I don't think I have a right to interfere in the lives of the gay community. I don't see them as messengers of evil, and I have no vendetta against them, either political or religious.<br />  d.  I get the impression that Dobson doesn't have a clue as to how the poor live and the challenges they face.<br />2.  His attitude towards women.  Many women see Dobson as their friend, but he clearly upholds a hierarchical view of the male as the \\"head.\\"  While this doesn't necessarily need to be a problem (though it often ends up that way) he also puts women into a \\"Catch 22\\" situation:<br />  a.  He wants women to make their homes and families the center of their lives.<br />  b.  But then, he has critiqued the fact that women don't seem to talk about topics from as broad a base as men do -- and has even had programs that impress on women that they need to have something in their lives besides home and family.  But he forgets that MANY women have made the home and family the center of their lives by listening to HIM.<br />I worked at a religious radio station for a while where Dobson's program was aired, and one time I had the poor judgment to express some of my problems with Dobson's ideas -- and I was treated like I had attacked God Himself!<br />I think that Dobson is trying to amass too much power (if it hasn't already happened) and is trying to speak for the Christian community as a whole.  Well, Dobson does not represent all Christians.<br />The best way to \\"Christianize\\" a country is for Christians to non-coercively share Jesus Christ with their family, friends, colleagues, etc., and let them accept Christ on their own.  If enough Christians will simply live their lives as Christ would have them live it and practice GENUINE Christian love (I  Corinthians 13) then I believe that more people will become Christians than through any kinds of laws made by any kind of government.le as the \\"head.\\"  While this doesn't necessarily need to be a problem (though it often ends up that way) he also puts women into a \\"Catch 22\\" situation:<br />    a.

Something wasn't right.  While I never read a lot of the matters in detail while they were going on, this book confirmed a lot of unease I was feeling.<br />I won't reiterate the issues raised by Paul Waldman - he writes them clearly and understandably.  But basically, the book deals with Bush's manipulation of the media, his building up of a \\"down home\\" type of persona, his \\"turn around of the meaning\\" explanations concerning tax cuts (Waldman makes use of Orwell's \\"doublespeak) as well as his \\"war on terrorism.\\"  Most thinking people, whether conservative or liberal will find a lot of food for thought.<br />Also fascinating was the insight that the Republican Party - a party begun under Abraham Lincoln Of The Emancipation Proclamation - has become more and more reactionary and \\"conservative\\" in the most negative sense - especially on social issues. In other words, the Republican party of today has turned into something I don't know any more.<br />This has all troubled me a lot.  For my entire adult voting life, I would probably be called an economic \\"conservative\\" - if, by that term, we refer to being pro private enterprise, opposing excessive government handouts, and taking the idea that it is business in general and people in particular who produce the wealth from which our taxes come.  From a social viewpoint, I may be more of a centrist, as I am also very concerned about the problems of the poor and the targets of racial and gender discrimination.  (Yes, I value \\"property rights,\\" which the conservatives favor greatly - but then, I also want my civil rights.)<br />My reason for not giving this book five stars is when it got into partisan politics and tried to show one party as being more interested in people than the other.  For sure, conservatives need to treat their workers fairly as well as guard against racial and gender discrimination.  Government regulations came about because many businesses treated their employees badly in the past; that's a matter of historical record.  Working people, racial minorities and women have not always fared well from policies advocated by conservatives.<br />Liberals, however, need to realize business and economic activity generate taxes.  Businesspeople, for sure, are not angels and yes, we do need some government regulation.  But Liberals must remember that government people are not angels, and we need accountability on both sides to restrain greed, which runs rampant in both business and government.<br />I recommend the book highly.as guard against racial and gender discrimination.

I agree that the American family is often fragmented, but each family must work out its own way, finding the 20% that applies to that particular family, and not in one die-cut, predetermined way.  &quot;Nonconformity&quot; is not my style, but I've made personal choices (such as waiting until late in life to marry) that don't always fit these predetermined ways to live, and my 20% may be different from the 20% of someone who has gone the &quot;traditional family&quot; route.  (A &quot;traditional family&quot; can be as abusive and stifling as it can be supporting and loving.)<br />I agree with the reviewer who said to read this book to look for the 20% that applies to you, and then ignore the other 80%.	2004-04-10

No matter how sick a loved one is, and no matter how much \\"logic\\" says that they are better off to be loosed from all that suffering, there is something in us that still doesn't want to see the person go. I also believe that we need to GIVE love as well as receive it.  And when Jazzy, a precious Yorkshire Terrier, appeared in Cindy's life it was somebody for her to love.  Not a replacement -- but a genuine and healthy outlet for love and affection.<br />It is impossible for any true dog lover not to identify with this story.  I was single when I got Macho, my Boston Terrier,  and as important as it was to have someone love me, it did as much good or more to have someone TO LOVE, and Macho was definitely that, just as Jazzy was for Cindy Adams.  And when Macho went to Doggy Heaven and I adopted Barbie (my Chihuahuah mix) I never expected that she would replace the dog I lost -- but it was an opportunity to love someone and to give.  And while I can't read Cindy Adams' mind, I'll bet that Jazzy filled the same place in her life.  It was wonderful to read about her love for this little animal and to know that many other people feel the same way.<br />I've not read anything \\"(yet) about Jazzy's passing -- I'll probably cry like a little kid when I do.  Cindy --if you're reading this, do consider getting yourself another dog!  It won't replace Jazzy, but as with him, it will be another very worthy outlet for love and affection.	2004-02-20

About two or three pages into the book, you will find yourself immersed in the story.  His opening description of Charleston, South Carolina is worth the price of the book -- usually long descriptions bore me, but this one was different -- I felt like I had actually been to Charleston after reading it.<br />This story is brutal in some of its details of living and learning in a military school.  I have a sneaky suspicion that they are right on target.  The hazing, the competitiveness and control and betrayal practiced by cadets on other cadets is uncomfortably like the control games seen outside of military schools.<br />I am neither male nor a graduate of a military school, but I have a feeling that Conroy's descriptions, given through the character of Will McClean, are accurate.  This book has the unmistakable stamp of someone who has &quot;been there and done that.&quot;<br />There are many plots and subplots -- a young woman whom Will meets, Will's relationship with &quot;The Bear&quot; (Colonel Bearineau)and Will's duty to watch out for Cadet Pearce, the first Afro-American cadet in the Institute's history.  And while there is a lot of grimness and harshness, Will stubbornly tries to keep his mind on the good as well as the bad, and he succeeds.<br />Whether or not the book has a &quot;good&quot; ending will depend on the reader's definition of what a &quot;good&quot; ending is.  It is triumphant and Will emerges a better person.	2004-01-25

It's been my observation that men are valued by what they DO.  This is something they can control.  If a man is shortchanged in looks or physique he can still make, do, and act and be a man.  And even a physically unattractive man can succeed in work and with women.<br />However, women are valued more by things they can't control -- like looks, shape, etc. Dieting and styles and makeup can help women look better, but still it is still not nearly as much in her control as initiative taking and &quot;doing&quot; is for men.  And to me, &quot;BEING&quot; is not as easily controlled as &quot;DOING.&quot;<br />I am not in favor of being a &quot;control freak.&quot;  But we may need to do a big redefinition of BEING.  Folks, BEING results in actions.  For me to BE who I am, I must be a writer, musician, teacher and thinker and artist.  And that is going to involve writing, teaching, thinking, drawing and painting.  Guess what!  Those are actions!  Oh, dear!  Did my estrogen level go down when I started to write this review?<br />I can't help thinking that this is more of the Mars/Venus stuff rehashed.<br />To me, the best way for a woman to treat her husband is with plain old fashioned GOOD MANNERS.  I try not to &quot;upstage&quot; him because that would be disrespectful and mean.  Do you know how I know that?  It's because I don't like it when anyone else -- male or female -- tries to upstage me.  It's mean.  It's impolite.  And it's egotistical.<br />On the other hand, if I can do something that he can't do, and he feels threatened by that, then I say that the relationship is not worth having.  If he &quot;has&quot; to have a higher IQ than I do, if he &quot;has&quot; to be the most capable person in the relationship, then it's phony, pure and simple.  And it would make me respect men and masculinity less.<br />Fortunately, I think most rational men would agree.<br />I would rather attract a man in the middle of doing something I enjoy doing and have him compliment me on THAT as opposed to my &quot;blue eyes&quot; or something else over which I have ixnay zilcho control.<br />By the way -- I am happily married to a man who thinks that this stereotyping stuff is silly.e on THAT as opposed to my &quot;blue eyes&quot; or something else over which I have ixnay zilcho control.<br />By the way -- I am happily married to a man who thinks that this stereotyping stuff is silly.	2004-01-23

You can go through it at your own pace and it's presented in an easy to understand way.  You can spend as much time as necessary with each page. You can finish reading it understanding the mechanics of memory a lot better, and even a surface practicing of the techniques will help a lot.<br />Of course, systematic practice will work even better.<br />Some of Lorayne's other books present more detailed information, but this one is a good, solid presentation of memory improvement and is maybe one of the easiest ones to begin to put into practice for immediate improvement.<br />It is especially good for people who have had no prior exposure to memory improvement and would like to have some practical advice that they can implement right away.<br />Try it!

Over all, I'm glad I read it.<br />It deals with the often sugar-coated agression of girls against each other.  It deals with the use of friendship as a weapon, silent treatment and rejection as nonviolent torture devices. The author deals with girls, but does make a point of saying that (a) boys sometimes do it and (b) not all girls behave this way.<br />I identified with a great deal of it.  I was ridiculed by the &quot;in crowd&quot; in junior high school and was too clueless and innocent to realize it.  After a while I found out, to my humiliation.  And although it took a while for the embarassment to go away I eventually got on with my life and even joined a club in high school that eventually helped me get into the college I went to and the pain was over -- or so I thought.<br />Wrong.  The memory lingered on.  And although I considered my life to be productive and useful I still cringed every time I remembered those days.  In fact, at times I still do.<br />Reading this book did me a lot of good, and I think it can benefit almost any woman (or man) who reads it.  These are just some of the reasons I liked the book:<br />1.  It showed me that I was not alone and that others have gone through this, too.  And while I wouldn't wish the experience on anyone, it was a comfort to know that others have felt the same way I have and that I am not the &quot;only one.&quot;<br />2.  It showed me that it wasn't always &quot;my fault&quot; when these things happened.  True, a lot of times girls make it plain through body language and nonverbal clues that they &quot;want&quot; to be friends, and this makes them a target for nasty behavior. However, that is still no excuse to mistreat someone.<br />3.  It showed me that it is ALL RIGHT to be hurt by a nasty remark covered over with the &quot;goo&quot; of &quot;I was just kidding.&quot;  This is especially nasty to do to sensitive people; it makes the victim feel like it was &quot;her fault&quot; that she feels the way she does.<br />4.  It also shows how easy it is for the &quot;oppressed to become the oppressor&quot; and later on inflict this on other girls.<br />5.  The author does show steps that can be taken to cope with the &quot;alternative aggression&quot; among girls, appealing to parents and teachers alike.  She also shows girls how they can take proactive control of their lives and see relationships as an option and not a mandate.  One of the greatest personal discoveries I made was that my best relationships are often a result of getting involved in something I enjoy doing rather than pursuing them for their own sake.<br />I think this book is worthwhile reading for both women and men alike.  I would not be surprised if men might identify with it more than they might think.  I have a private conviction that boys' and men's relationships with each other is &quot;just like it only different.&quot;  Reading A SEPARATE PEACE and THE LORDS OF DISCIPLINE show that their relationships are not easy, either -- but then, that would entail doing separate reviews.feel like it was &quot;her fault&quot; that she feels the way she does.<br />4.

In fact, I thought that if I only would be able to have one self-help book, it would be this one.<br />THE NEW PSYCHO CYBERNETICS has taken a good book and made it even better.  The masterful editing and adapting by Dan Kennedy is great.  It still is done in the voice of the original author, Dr. Maxwell Maltz, but it has up to date examples of people most of us know from this time in history, yet it still includes the examples Dr. Maltz wrote about in his original book.<br />The theme hasn't changed -- Dr. Maltz claimed that the human mind has a &quot;servo-mechanism&quot; which can help us accomplish what we desire, but we must let it do its work once the desire is &quot;fed into&quot; the mind.  He drew upon his knowledge of the then fledgling work of computers.  And now in the 21st century, computers have advanced in an unbelievable manner, and yet the principle behind which they work is still the same; the goal-striving mechanism which works towards its teleological end by negative feedback, correction, and positive feedback.<br />I have other self help books, but for me, this one is the basis on which all the others are carried out.<br />I can't recommend it highly enough.	2004-01-11

Jerry Stocking)delves into at great length,<br />The book is written in simple English and does not use a heavy vocabulary. However, I found myself going over some of the same paragraphs several times, not because it was hard to understand, but because it was so information and thought rich.<br />Central to understanding the book is knowing the distinctions between awareness and consciousness (they are not the same thing) and understanding the role the mind plays -- or, rather, does NOT play -- in enlightenment.<br />The fact that I didn't always agree with the author doesn't matter. He gives a perspective that this materialistic and achievement obsessed culture needs to hear.<br />I gave the book four stars instead of five for the following reasons:<br />1. There is a glossary in back that defines the terms that Jerry Stocking uses. He has just about re-defined some terms (like \\"doing\\" and \\"nothing\\") into new meanings not generally used by most other people. It might be a good idea to read the glossary first to have a better picture of where the author is coming from.<br />2. I saw a tendency to imply that if you don't believe X, then you assuredly believe in Y, which sounds to me like the logical fallacy of \\"False Dilemma,\\" or \\"Either-Or,\\" both of which make me nervous.<br />However, don't let that stop you from reading it. (Heck, I don't bat 1000 in logic myself!) This book is definitely worth your time and it could even change your life.	2003-10-27

I like to work logic puzzles and I love a good plot-filled mystery with lots of surprises, and this one had them in abundance.  And the city of Paris in general and the Louvre museum in particular are made to order for heart-pounding thrillers, and this book is no exception.  The symbolism is wildly fascinating,the characterizations are good, the pace is fast, and the twists and turns of the plot kept me on the edge of my seat.<br />However, I had two problems with the book -- or maybe I can say ONE objection with two aspects, and each objection cost it one star in my evaluation.<br />1.  There are a lot of historical &quot;facts&quot; given here that challenge the teachings of Orthodox Christianity (both Catholic and Protestant).  I won't go into detail about them here, but I'll say this:  I wish the author had given some good, solid sources so that we, the readers, could have checked on the sources ourselves.  One of the characters in the story states that many &quot;respected&quot; historian-scholars could corroborate the view about the &quot;real&quot; meaning of the Holy Grail and the &quot;real&quot; history of Christ.  I would have liked to know who they were.  I also would like to have known if the story's take on the life of Christ, the Knights Templar and the Holy Grail legend was an honest-to-goodness historical view or one invented by the author for the story's purpose.<br />2.  I also felt like the author was &quot;blaming&quot; Christianity for the bad treatment of women.  Maybe he wasn't, and I misunderstood him.  But I feel it is important to mention that the church did not invent the bad treatment of women.  This is important to know, because while the church(both Catholic and Protestant) has left a lot to be desired in its treatment of women, the view of women as inferiors (which is unBiblical, by the way) was in existence long before the church ever came into being.<br />Anyone who has studied Western Civilization and/or Far Eastern history will know that ancient cultures, many of whom had a plethora of female deities, still treated their women like dirt.  The ancient Greeks held women in contempt -- just read Aristotle, who lived before Christ. Ancient and not-so-ancient India and China have historically mopped up the floor with women, female deities in their culture notwithstanding.<br />I know what an extreme patriarchal mindset some churches have -- as a woman I have been on the receiving end of it.

Maybe it's in the genes; I don't know. I do know that in spite of a wonderfully spiritual upbringing (I've read the Bible all the way through at least five times) and reading many self-help books, I still have had a hard time trusting God or other people.  I couldn't understand why, and I didn't feel like I could blame my religion.<br />In fact, at one time I considered this Biblical quote: Mark 4:40 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? (Jesus speaking).  And I answered the passage myself, \\"I don't know?  How is it that I have no faith?\\"<br />Some time later I learned of the Sedona Method.  It is not a religious system as such, but basically it teaches you how to release FEELINGS.  I was intrigued by this, as it seemed like most of my struggles with faith were on the \\"feeling\\" level.  Even when my mind knew that things would be all right, I could't get my raging feelings and emotions to cooperate.  At the time I heard first of the Sedona Method it was on a set of ten cassette tapes.  I ordered a set, began listening to them and right away I started benefitting from them.<br />Then the book came out, and it incorporates the basic Sedona Method as well as some \\"advanced\\" ideas from two other sets of tapes put out by the same company.  I ordered the book the minute I saw it being offered on Amazon.com.  And all I can say is, WOW!<br />As with the tapes, this book gives you a step-by-step way to release feelings.  It is a \\"system\\" as opposed to a mechanistic \\"formula.\\"  It is written in a loving, supportive and empathetic way.  The Sedona Method is simple, but that doesn't keep it from being very profound.  And you don't have to have the audio tapes to understand the book. It is written very clearly and simply, but the ideas are very profound and I've had lots of times of reading a paragraph and just stopping -- and thinking -- and internalizing.<br />I am still learning.  I am worrying less than before -- and when I do worry, I am able to release it faster than before.

He then gives a system that anyone can use to work through problems.<br />It has helped me to face up to my nagging \\"inner critic\\" -- that nasty little voice in my imagination that loves to tell me about what a loser I am and how I'll never succeed.  In fact, I've found it helpful to actually write down the inner critic's accusation and write my assertive responses to them!<br />It might help to read WHEN I SAY NO I FEEL GUILTY first, but the book can also stand on its own.	2003-08-22

He accurately calls the American political parties the &quot;Demopublicans.&quot;  (I like the term &quot;Republicrat&quot;)  His views are definitely Libertarian.<br />Here's the reason I couldn't give the book 5 stars:  He states that he believes that when people know the true, right way to things, they will DO IT RIGHT.  Although I am not cynical about humanity in general, I still don't share this positive view.  I believe that there are people out there who jolly well know the right thing to do and they deliberately choose NOT to do it.  In fact, anybody who has ever raised children and/or taught in a classroom in a public school knows that.<br />However, if enough people begin doing the right thing, it will make a difference in society.

I wouldn't trade it for the world.  My family wasn't perfect, but there was a lot of love and affection along with good, thorough learning of the Bible and what It really means, and most important, emphasis on the God of the Scriptures.<br />And except for not going to school dances, we didn't live with a lot of &quot;do's and don'ts.&quot;  To be honest, we had so many fish to fry with our church and Youth For Christ (Campus Life) activities, that I didn't miss dancing at all.<br />But unfortunately many of the Christian organizations I was exposed to were a totally different story.  My father is an evangelist and we went to a lot of Bible Conferences as well many different churches and organizations, and there were times I thought I would never be able to keep up with the restrictions and artificial rules that some of these groups tried to promote as Biblical.<br />Donald Sloat, in his book THE DANGERS OF GROWING UP IN A CHRISTIAN HOME points this out accurately and well.  Most of the examples show rules to live by that are either unbiblical or carried to an extreme that the Bible never intended.  He is quick to show the extremes that people can go to, but he never once discredits real Christianity.<br />This book is guaranteed to make you think!	2003-08-09

He is concerned with living a life of integrity and adopting principles of self discipline, especially in the face of impulse and action.  His goal was to be just, self-disciplined, courageous and independent, and to live in the present.<br />The book is divided into sections and the paragraphs are numbered.

I write this as a female who once again fails to fit the stereotype.<br />In the words of Neuro-Linguistic Programing (NLP) sometimes we have to &quot;sort by difference.&quot;  Men and woman are different, to be sure.  And I think it behooves both men and women to realize this.<br />But in my humble opinion, this book leans more towards generalizing too much. And when I read generalizations, especially those written by educated people, I often fall into the trap of (a) expecting all members of each gender to act the same and (b) thinking that there is something wrong with me because I don't fit the stereotype and (c) feeling like I can't improve my performance on something -- like reading maps -- because genetically and hormonally, I'm not cut out to do it.<br />To be sure, the Peases use other examples besides &quot;men not listening&quot; and &quot;women not reading maps.&quot;  But I will stick to these two.<br />1.  Even if men &quot;naturally&quot; don't listen, they can learn to do so, and this process is not going to lower their testosterone level.  It's called GOOD MANNERS.  Men are fully capable of doing this.  It may take some practice, as all good skills do.  But it can be done.<br />2.  If women don't &quot;naturally&quot; read maps, they need to be taught how to do so.  There is nothing about estrogen levels that precludes a woman from learning how to read route numbers and to learn that the top of the page is North, the bottom is south, the left is West, and the right is East. And it won't make a woman any less than a woman if she is taught how to use a compass.  It can be done!<br />The Peases try to attempt the &quot;nature-nurture&quot; argument.  I don't know how they would respond to what I have to say here, but I think that there is something to it.  My father has a profession where he has to travel a lot, so I learned to read maps at a very early age.  He is also an artist, so I learned spatial concepts early on, too.  I was also exposed to domestic skills too (i.e., keeping house) and I didn't catch onto that very well!<br />Maybe a book like this can help men and women understand the difference in communication styles.  However, I've had just as much trouble understanding the communication styles of my female friends as I have my male ones.<br />Maybe if we all practice common courtesy, good manners, and good teaching principles, some of these &quot;general&quot; differences won't be as noticeable.

Is this why I didn't marry til I was 55?	Here we go again.  It's Mars and Venus again, but this time with unwillingness to listen by men and inability to read maps by women.  Just like it, only different!    I hate to say this, folks, but this female learned to read maps a long time ago.  And I have a father who listens very well.  Maybe the authors of this book would say we're \\"exceptions.\\"  I only know that there are a lot of exceptions out there!    My problem with this book isn't \\"politically incorrect\\" issues.  I just don't like stereotyping.    I'll tell you why I can read a map.  I learned how.  I stayed awake in my geography class and learned what north, south, east and west meant.  I learned what route numbers were.  I followed the routes, learned what the numbers meant, and found out that I could read it!  I liked to look at the globe, and found that when a country was positioned directly above another country it was to the NORTH!  (Gasp) I wonder if my estrogen count went down because of this.    I also learned spatial concepts.  Why?  I learned them!  I was taught them!  Although I'm American, I come from a long line of Dutch painters and learned three point perspective (adjusting three dimensions to a flat surface) and I learned all about volume in square feet, yards, miles -- and even cubic centimeters.  Uh, oh!  Another drop in estrogen?  I don't know, but I sure have had fun painting pictures.    And patents?  Well, how many women have had ideas that we haven't heard of?  We won't know -- because they haven't been mentioned!  However, many a policeman can thank a woman for inventing the bullet proof vest, many a fireman is grateful for fire excapes (invented by a female).  I have also heard that the laser printer was invented by a woman.    I have my some ideas to offer here:    1.  If women are less likely to mess around than men, it is because sex produces babies and the woman is the one who carries the baby around for nine months and gives birth to it.  Women simply have more personal consequences.  To me, it's odd that a man is more \\"polygamous\\" but will break out in white-heat anger if the woman in his life is interested in anyone else but him.    2.  If women can't read maps, parallel park or do mechanical things as well as men, teach them to do it, for crying out loud! That's probably how men learn to do it.  By the way, my best friend could parallel park like a pro, and she told me that it was because her driver ed teacher gave her an exact procedure for doing it right.    3.  If men like to give advice and not take it, tell them to grow up.    4.  If men don't listen, teach them how to do it.  If men don't \\"naturally\\" listen, and women don't \\"naturally read maps (or whatever other tasks each gender is't supposed to be able to do) it does not preclude their learning how.    5.  If a woman gets exasperated because her husband doesn't act like she does, or a man gets mad because his wife doesn't do things his way, then teach them that it is bad manners as well as harmful to try to make someone over.  This has nothing to do with gender dynamics and everything to do with plain old common courtesy.      I believe that gender generalizations can cause a lot of harm. For many years I didn't study logic and I stopped trying to better myself mathematically because I believed that I couldn't because I was female. Imagine my surprise when I aced a college logic test!    There has got to be a better way to deal with gender differences than arbitrarily telling people that they can or cannot do something well because of hormones.  Give me a break!	2003-08-06

When I started reading this book I was feeling a bit sick, and tired out from the pain medication I was taking.  This is the first Evanovich book I've read, so I wasn't sure what I was in for.<br />I laughed out loud two or three times within the first page.  The humor is natural, not at all contrived, and is a hilarious-but-true view of what it's like to be a young, single woman in an albeit unusual occupation.  It's impossible for me not to idetify with Stephanie Plum; she's smart but does not have an IQ of 210, she hassles with having to pay her bills, and while she likes dressing in a very feminine manner, she still carries tennis shoes in her shoulder bag should her &quot;strappy&quot; shoes fail her.<br />This book is a genuine mystery -- she's being stalked in New Jersey and it doesn't let up even in Las Vegas. It will keep you guessing as all good mysteries do.<br />Her female cohorts are equally hilarious --especially the rotund Lula, who is on a diet strangely (VERY strangely) resembling Dr. Atkins'plan, although I seriously doubt that Dr. Atkins would recognize it.<br />The humor is great, the story is page turning -- and even though it hasn't taken away my after-surgery pain, it has given me a lot of wonderful laughs.<br />In fact, if &quot;laughter is medicine,&quot; this one is a pharmacy!	2003-08-01

I wish I could have read this book about 30 years ago.<br />For my own part, I was raised in a loving Christian home, but I had to put up with a lot of &quot;do's&quot; and &quot;don'ts&quot; in my church, most of which were not anywhere to be found in the Bible (including the statement that a praying knee and a dancing foot never grow on the same leg).  My parents, however, were not controlling and we were a fairly happy family.  Our comittment to Jesus Christ bound us even closer together.<br />I went to Bible school and one of the courses I studied was enitled Biblical Interpretation.  It was an excellent course and well taught, and we learned the logical, common sense way to interpret the Bible.<br />However, I still managed to get involved in what I thought was a loving prayer group who later got caught up in the &quot;Discipleship&quot; controversey. I later was given the &quot;left foot of fellowship&quot; from the group when I made a remark that they interpreted as questioning their teachings.  (By the way, the &quot;left foot of fellowship&quot; means that I was unceremoniously booted out!)<br />If I had been able to have this book back then, I would have recovered from that bad experience much more quickly.  But I am glad that others are able to read it and recover from their traumatic experiences.<br />I am still 100% sold on the Christian faith, even though I'm not sold on some of the garbage that goes on in the name of Christianity.	2003-07-30

He suggests using a dish rack for temporary sorting of file folders.

We have to take care of ourselves before we can be of much use to anyone else. In order to give, I need to have something to give.  And Robert Ringer offers his advice on how to take care of yourself.<br />He deals with friends, financial matters and romance, to name a few.  He gives examples of his great triumphs, many of which he learned after his big time failures.  While he accepts no irresponsible excuses, he still writes with empathy -- he knows he has made mistakes, too.  And because he has risen above them, he has earned his right to advise his readers.<br />His humor and ability to coin phrases are unbelievable!  Many times I remind myself not to let the &quot;Pop off mess up man&quot; take over(read it and find out what that means).<br />My favorite section of the book is his chapter on building a strong, solid financial life.<br />Read it!

All I can say by way of summary that there are four parts:  Part One contains twenty three essays, Part Two contains sixteen, Part Three contains nine.  Part Four contains letters written by Lewis.<br />These essays deal with a lot of subjects written by C. S. Lewis, one of the most thorough and profound Christian writers that I have read.  This book has influenced me beyond my ability to describe it.  I've been a student of the Bible all of my life and of C. S. Lewis for more than 25 years -- and I can truthfully say that Lewis has helped me more than any other single Christian author, and I've read some good ones.<br />Of special interest to me were (and still are)Essay #13 on page 114 (Section one) Essay #1 on page 189 (Section 2) and Essay #3 on page 196 (also Section 2) which deal directly or indirectly with the subject of politics and religion.  I won't tell you what Lewis says about it -- I'd be happier if you'd read it for yourself.<br />Even the articles I didn't agree with (and there were very few of those) still were worth reading and gave me a lot to think about.<br />If you're a thinking person, this will be some of the best money you will spend on any Christian book -- except for the Bible itself.	2003-07-13

Does the title of this review seem confusing?  Well, let me explain.<br />I grew up in a culture that was \\"conservative\\" -- an ambiguous term, to be sure.  Some may still consider me conservative.  I don't like excessive deficit spending, I think the Federal Government has gotten too big, I'm pro private enterprise, I'm pro-family and hold to a myriad of other principles that many would consider \\"conservative.\\"<br />But I have not liked some of the directions I've seen the more extreme right taking lately.  I don't have all the facts and figures that both the liberal and conservative commentators have, so what I share here is impression which may or may not have to be corrected.  But my discomfort will show why I appreciated what Brock had to say.<br />Neither conservatives nor liberals have a corner on lying.  For so long I've listened to conservatives bewail the lies of the liberals, and they may very well be true.  But I have often wondered if the conservatives might be doing the same thing.  Brock's book was interesting for me because it addressed this question that had been nagging me for years.  I didn't see Brock trying to espouse any particular political view.  But I did see a writer who was trying to correct some wrongs that he felt were promoted by \\"The Right.\\"<br />He tries to give a balanced view of the Whitewater matter -- something I can't comment on because I don't have the information that he does.  He tries to give a balanced view of Hillary Clinton as well. He also tries to correct a lot of information he previously gave about Anita Hill.<br />I appreciated this book because:<br />1.  I am a Christian who is distressed at seeing the Religious Right grab the flag and the cross and try to promote their political agenda as being straight from God Himself.<br />2.  I am a straight, white married woman, but I don't like gay-bashing.  For that matter, I don't like the outright bashing of any people different from oneself.<br />3.  The ultra conservative right doesn't seem to be very concerned about the needs of the poor.  While I'm not in favor excessive government handouts, I do believe that we need to have a system that will be fair to everyone.<br />I think Brock's book needs to be read, even by people who think thy don't agree with him.  I'm not sure if I agree with everything he says, either.  But it brings a perspective that needs to be seen, if we are to be open minded and consider all sides to the issue.right doesn't seem to be very concerned about the needs of the poor.

This book shows the problems experienced by a young couple who were involved in the Shepherding Movement surfacing early 1970's in the Charismatic Movement (which was strongly influencing Evangelical Christianity).  Basically, there were four (later five) prominent Bible teachers who began to emphasize an obedience to human authority all out of proportion to what is actually taught in the Bible.<br />And this hit close to home.  Although my experience was different from the authors', I still could identify with it strongly.  In the early 1970's I was going through a difficult time in my life, and I received a great deal of spiritual and emotional support from the Charismatic Movement.<br />However, I began to notice a shift in the loving, caring prayer group I had been attending. They were showing disturbing authoritarian attitudes and sexism, emphasizing an obedience to human authority that seemed oppressive to me. It turned out my formerly loving prayer group was buying into this \\"Shepherding Movement.\\" Later on I questioned some of the ideas they were putting out, and I got emphatically shown the door!<br />Even though these Bible teachers are not teaching \\"Shepherding\\" any more, many lives have been hurt by this, and the book is well worth reading.  This kind of problem can happen again when people put obedience to human authority on the same par with obedience to God.<br />We need to be aware of this -- and most important, we need to study the Bible for ourselves to find out what it actually says.  There still are oppressive groups out there who operate in much the same way, even if the name is different.	2003-07-06

When I first saw this book by Cherry Boone O'Neil, the oldest Boone daughter, I was intrigued and wanted to read it.<br />Although I do not suffer from anorexia (in fact, I would like to lose a few pounds) my heart went out to Cherry Boone's plight.  She lived such a public life as the child of a very famous man, and felt like her life was being controlled.  Her description of the struggle with anorexia and the motivations behind it are heart-wrenching.<br />She also shows (helpfully or unhelpfully, depending on the reader) the challenges of growing up in an extremely strict home. The book does not flatter Pat Boone at all, although it does show him admitting that his own attitudes didn't help her problem.  Whether or not her anorexia came from her home life can't be proven or disproven in the book -- perhaps some people with anorexia didn't have the same problems she did.  I don't know.<br />However, it is good to know that she overcame the problem and is now helping others who have problems with anorexia.  And I am sure that it will help others who struggle with this baffling condition.	2003-06-02

True, many people (maybe a majority) will respond positively when you practice Dale Carnegie's plan, but there is a sizeable minority who will walk all over you regardless.<br />And a person who has self-image problems?

He also doesn't approve of aspects of the ministry and points those out, too.<br />I attended the Institute of Basic Youth Conflicts (as it was called back in the '70's) and each year it got more difficult to listen to.  Especially difficult for me was Bill Gothard's insisting on single adults living at home until they are married and getting parental approval for almost every decision made.<br />I love, honor and respect my parents . . . in fact, at my age (considerably over 21) I feel fortunate and blessed that I still have them both.  But I have made some decisions without consulting them and guess what!

The second time I reviewed what I did learn, appreciated them but found myself disagreeing with even more and feeling a bit more uneasy. The third time I had a lot more problems and fewer blessings. But so many of my friends were gung ho on Bill Gothard that it was hard to talk about where I disagreed with him.<br />Suffice it to say, after receiving other materials in the mail for the \\"alumni\\" (people who have been to his seminar) and purchasing some reading items, I was getting more and more troubled. Finally, I asked to have my name removed from the alumni list.<br />This book is a good critique on Bill Gothard's ministry.

I would strongly recommend reading it.<br />But I would like to know how the author kept his family housed and fed when he \\"quit\\" the culture.<br />I agree that there are many games we play that are not necessary and drain the living daylights out of us.  And unfortunately there are a lot of games we play that we are required to play and they also drain the living daylights -- and even the life -- out of us.<br />Perhaps we don't need to play \\"Thou Shalt Work\\" and other games.  But I am emmeshed in something called \\"Thou Shalt Eat Or Thou Shalt Die of Starvation\\" and \\"Thou Shalt House Thyself or Thou Shalt End Your Life Years Ahead Of Time.\\"<br />Maybe I'm being too pragmatic?  I guess I'm still addicted to being alive, silly me.	2002-11-03

A while back when I was in my 30's (never mind how long ago that was!) I was sick with the flu, and I found a copy of HEIDI, so I crawled into a nice warm bed and re-read the book -- as an adult.<br />What insight into human nature!  And as an adult I appreciated the dry, understated humor.  I also appreciated the spiritual insights -- that God will give us what we desire, but sometims uses circumstances we don't like to teach us truths that we couldn't learn otherwise.<br />When I was a girl I was often turned off by what was called \\"good reading,\\" but for some reason, I enjoyed Heidi and it never seemed sappy or corny.<br />Very much worth reading!	2002-09-15

If men are from Mars and women are from Venus, why does my birth certificate say &quot;Detroit?&quot;<br />I am a woman in my mid-50's and I am a person, not a stereotype. Some things I do may seem &quot;stereotypically&quot; feminine. I love babies, I think about relationships, and even though I am an adult, I like cute, cuddly, stuffed toys . . . especially dogs and teddy bears. And I have a two year old Chihuahuah mix puppydog whom I have lavishly spoiled.<br />But I don't always talk about what bothers me, and while I appreciate a person's caring, I value my privacy -- in other words, I have a cave as deep as any man's, and I don't talk about my problems until I am good and ready to. Did I also mention that I have a dragon at the mouth of my cave, too?<br />I care about my friends, but I don't always take an active interest in what they are doing because I am busy frying my own fish. Weddings bore the living daylights out of me -- unless, of course, as an organist, I can make some extra money playing for them. And as for being &quot;romantic. . . &quot; well, I am kind hearted and affectionate, but I've had several relationships with men go right down the drain because the one who has been unromantic was ME! At the moment I am contemplating getting married, but my idea of a perfect wedding is the Justice Of The Peace office with the secretary and maintenance man as witnesses!<br />Men and women are different; of course! It wouldn't be fun if they weren't. But I don't think the line is as sharply drawn as Dr. Gray says it is. I'll admit that when a smart cookie like Dr. Gray makes his statements, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that something is wrong with me. But when it comes to a choice between self-acceptance and Dr. Gray acceptance, I'll take my own, thank you.<br />I am wondering what kind of effect his book has had on men. Stereotypes are as unfair to men as to women.<br />If a man has a dragon by his cave, that's OK. However, he had better keep his dragon tamed, just as I have to keep mine tamed. The second that I get bitten by someone's dragon, I confront the owner. We adults need to keep our pets under control, don't we?ep his dragon tamed, just as I have to keep mine tamed.

I liked the book when I first started it, but bit by bit its value to me waned.  Like a previous reviewer, I also have suffered from depression, and it is not a picnic, believe me.  It's not even creative -- at least not for me.  I have learned how to &quot;release&quot; it instead of &quot;fight&quot; it, and perhaps Thomas Moore would approve of that.  But in our effort to embrace tough situations and learn from them, we need to guard against an &quot;I love hardships&quot; attitude.<br />If I feel bad or am in difficult circumstances, it is not good to beat myself up over it, and in this case, &quot;accepting&quot; bad situations can be a good thing.  We live in a world where bad situations are a fact of life.  We can ride them out and learn from them.  But we can also use our wonderful minds to improve our situations, and keep bad situations at bay as much as possible.  Their very painfulness can send us signals that a correction is called for.<br />Our minds and imaginations are given to us for a purpose.  Let's use them to make things better!	2001-11-07

I checked it out, and sat down in the library to read it. . . and I was afraid I'd get kicked out of the library for laughing so hard.  None of this humor is put on or contrived . . . it flows out of her thoughts and is genuine.<br /><br />**********************<br /><br />It is now ten years later.<br /><br />I still appreicate her unbelievable sense of humor.  I come from a family of punsters and jokesters -- one very significant gift I got from my mother when I was eight years old was a joke book.  The funny bone runs deep in both my parent's families, and as a matter of fact, I completed a humor writing course this past summer.  So her style of writing was right up my \\"enjoyment\\" alley and continues to be so.<br /><br />But I need to add something here.<br /><br />I first read this book in the '60's when racially, the emphasis was on discrimination against Afro-Americans, and with good reason.  It was the time of Rosa Parks, bus boycotts, and freedom riders. I dislike racism in all forms (another quality of my whole family) and while I was about three or four years too young to take part in these activities, I was wholeheartedly on their side as they struggled for their rights to attend the public Universities, attend the schools of their choice, and to just plain be treated with respect, dignity and equal privileges.<br /><br />Why am I saying this?  Because even when I read THE EGG AND I back then, I was put off by what seemed to me like a blanket judgment against Native Americans.  I especially didn't appreciate the chapter that dealt with coming a \\"long time since Hiawatha.\\" I didn't like that part even as a teenager and now that I am considerably older, I like it even less.<br /><br />I've tried to give her the benefit of the doubt.  She led a lonely life in a totally new enviornment for her and having to cope with a lifestyle she most likely wasn't cut out for.  To be honest, I think that a lot of her criticism of Native Americans was rooted in the sexism she saw on a regular basis. I'd like to think that had it not been for that, she might have been more gracious.<br /><br />Maybe.  Maybe not.  That's something I guess we'll never know.  But I must say that I still didn't care for her sweeping generalizations about Native Americans.  \\"Native American\\" covers many different cultures, languages and regions, and to me, it's wrong to paint any ethnic group (all of whom are made up of unique individuals) as all the same, especially when \\"the same\\" is a litany of negative qualities.I'd like to think that had it not been for that, she might have been more gracious.
