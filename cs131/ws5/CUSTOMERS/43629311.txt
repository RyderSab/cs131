Steel's writings have never failed to be entertaining, challenging, never failed to touch me emotionally, nor test my intelligence, until now. I agree with those who have stated they felt the book was written on a 5th grade level. The writing was way too simple for adult readers. DS did not put herself into this book. She had an ulterior motive for writing this selection.	2003-09-22

There was unfaithfulness, angry, doubt, depression, distrust and other emotions felt by one or both of the main characters. Jessie had a hard time at first but decided to move forward with her life. With the help of a friend's mother, (greatest &quot;psychotherapist&quot; I ever saw) Jessie was able to work through the pain and suffering and made her life what she wanted it to be. <br />Read the book.

It is so heartwarming to see three girls befriended as children and grow to womanhood still cherishing the friendship each has with the other. The story is an inspiration to many women struggling to make their way in life after a major setback. Margo shows strength, bravery and determination needed to succeed. Her friends, Kate and Ann, are there to offer support. Of course, there is a love story in the middle of all the crises.

They also have another person they are responsible for during the trip. The book tells of the events and trials the couple endures along the way. Ruth turns to God for her strength due to a strong faith she possesses. She does what she can to convince Mcall that God loves him and cares what happens to him. He has a hard time believing her because of his rearing by a woman that preached hell and damnation and not the love of God.

The co-star of the book is Jamie; a very independent determined individual of whom I had lots of respect. And then there was Beenie. I loved this character.

The author keeps repeating the same things over and over. I skimmed much of the book because I knew what it was going to say.<br />I agree with others who have written comments. DS just threw this book out to the public with little thought. It made the Best Seller's List simply on the author's name alone.

I could relate to Rennie Newton's character, as I'm sure anyone can who has experienced hurt and disappointment. Wick Threadgill is every woman's hero (and example of a man). He was wonderful. On the other hand there were others in the book that were simply put, creeps, for example: Ricky Roy Lozada. He had to be the devil's twin. He was as evil as a human can be. Read the book.

Honora makes a home for Sexton and herself.<br />The depression years hit hard and heavy. Sexton is forced to take a job at a mill in the town where the couple lives. The mill workers form a group to start a labor union, which is not all pleasing to Honora. She finds out what is going on in the town and with her husband through other people because Sexton does not tell her anything. <br />There are problems in Sexton and Honora's marriage that developed as a result of the times in which they were living and the activities of Sexton. Honora is tempted to stray outside the marriage and there are other forms of distrust that developed in the plot.<br />I gave the book a rating of only 3 because I cannot truthfully say I enjoyed the book. It was too slow to develop and I became bored waiting for something to happen. I would consider it a short story because the plot and characters do not ever become real to the reader.

I found myself getting so angry with Sarah for her actions and decisions she made which affected each family member so painfully.

The book takes a girl, Crystal Wyatt,(around 12 years old)from the time she is being reared on a ranch in Northern California all the way through her life until she is about 28 years of age. Her life takes several turns that include victories and defeats, disappointments and rewards. It shows her strength that makes it possible for her to &quot;bounce back&quot; when others would be defeated. <br />Crystal loves the land upon which she grew up. Her and her father made many memories during her childhood. He knew how much the land meant to her when it didn't mean that much to anyone else in the family. Crystal is rewarded for this in the end.<br />I will agree with other critics that DS repeated herself often and I got the message that Crystal was beautiful about half way through the book. It became redundant to keep saying how beautiful she was. I felt like the author was afraid the reader would forget how attractive her main character was. But, I still recommend the book to everyone.	2002-09-15

I think the author meant for this to be a type of short story. It was not a long story that had time to go into details about people and events. The reader had to use her/his imagination in some parts of the book. We were not told about the many nights Robert cried for his wife even when he was falling in love with Gwen. When a person looses a love one, he/she learns real early how to laugh on the outside while crying on the inside in order to go on with life. One does not stop loving a deceased person with whom they have shared their life even after another person comes into the picture. Life does have to go on if one wants to be happy. The reader has to fill in a lot of holes left by the author.<br />I did have a problem with the maid and the way she dressed. I could not fit her into the schema of things. Her character was almost too much to believe; a little too far out. I would like to have seen some other character in the maid's role.	2002-08-30

She is from a wealthy family and Temperance's father has died. He left an inheritance to Temperance but she is not able to lay hands on it. Her mother, Melanie O'Neal, has remarried and the new stepfather, Angus McCairn, has control over Temperance's money, as was customary in that era. Temperance has to leave New York and go to Scotland with her mother and Angus because that is where he is from. She very much wants to return to NY, so Angus makes a deal with Temperance. He has a nephew, James McCairn, who Angus wants to see married. He sends Temperance to James to play the part of his housekeeper but she is really trying to find him a bride.<br />I enjoyed the book very much. Although, it did border on the way a fairy tale would be told. It was difficult to grasp the dishonesty and stubbornness in both Temperance and James. I agree, too much time went by from the time Temperance leaves McCairn and the ending of the book. I like the way Temperance was forced to see herself the way she was when she arrived in McCairn. She was able to see how much she changed while she was living there. It showed great insight on the part of many of the characters.<br />Overall, I gave the book a 4 because I still felt it was a wonderful story. It was an easy read with a simple plot.	2002-08-04

Suspicion falls on Chief Hart when Gillian's mutilated body is found the next day. <br />Gillian's cocky boyfriend, Jem Hennings, has a vested interest in focusing police efforts on Hart, but Melina has her own reasons for thinking him wrong. Jem's connection with a charismatic preacher known as Brother Gabriel is at the heart of this mystery, in which Melina tracks Brother Gabriel to his lair and uncovers his diabolical plot while simultaneously revealing her own dark secret. The ending has some really good parts, including some sex scenes that are better than most of romantic thrillers of this sort. <br />This is definitely a book typical of Brown's writings.I recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery.	2002-07-10

Why wasn't he as committed to his orginial family as he was his second family?<br />Next, Adrian nearly drove me crazy by being so secretive to keep from having confrontations with different characters in the story. She was going to have to tell Bill she was pregnant sooner or later so why let their relationship grow knowing it may end? It did not make sense for her not to tell her mother about the baby sooner. She should have told those whom she worked with that Steven had left her. As it was, her co-workers thought she was having an affair. Did she not tell the co-workers she was pregnant because she thought they would never know? She took the \\"road of least resistance\\" too many times to suit me. There are many other questions I had while reading the book but you can read it for yourself. Many have loved the book.	2002-03-31

He sees so many others pass by him and go on into Heaven but not him. The Heavenly Council decides to send Sterling back to earth to prove himself worthy of entry into Heaven. The rest of the story is about the events that unfold as he helps more than one person with a really big problem. He finds out about the joy of making another person happy and not always striving to please oneself.<br />The book reminded me of the movies and TV shows we have seen;for example, &quot;Ghost&quot; with Patrick S.,&quot;Highway to Heaven&quot; with Michael L. and &quot;Touched By An Angle&quot;.

I highly recommend the book to anyone who likes to read a good love story with a little detective work within the plot. The author began the story with developing the characters and lives of the main character, Emily,her husband,Doug, and Emily's friends,Kay,John, and Celeste. Emily and her husband lost their son years before the story begins and their relationship has deteriorated to almost nothing. There are several stories going on within the book having to do with the different characters concerning one person's husband and other characters' children. Basically, the story is about the saddness and the happiness of this life. It is about a people dropping as far as they can go and then reveiling their strength to develop a new life and be happy.	2002-03-10

In my opinion, the story was boring, the characters were not well described and much of it was repitious without adding anything to the situation; for example, clocks chiming, doors slambing, baby crying. The same situation kept happening over and over without any variety to it.<br />This book is the 13th one I have read by the author. I loved all her other books but this one was a dud.	2002-02-26

But every family has its own trials and can relate to the strong bond in Jewel's family that makes it possible to indure the heartaches life can bring to a family.The marriage of Jewel and Leston is tested more than once. There commitment to their marriage vowels played a major part in them staying together until in their old age.<br />The book is very good.

I do not see where the author developes any of the characters to the point I feel like I really know them. The story is very shallow as far as knowing how characters really feel or behave;with the exception of the 100 year old &quot;Poppy&quot;. I saw a glimse of his character and could picture what he would look like. The story just rambles on and on about the events in a family's life but there is no climax to the story. Rebecca,a grandmother, is the main character. She is trying to find out why she has become the person she is. She is different from what she was as a young girl. She contacts an old friend and trys to rekindle a fire with him,she trys to talk with her mother but nothing ever happens in the story that brings out the climatic circumstance I kept waiting for.<BR>I suggest borrowing the book or checking it out at the library before deciding to purchase it.	2001-09-23

The characters and events protray the &quot;old&quot; south beginning with the slavery period up to the middle 1930's. Original picturers are displayed on the pages of the book, therefore, the reader does not have to imagine what the person looked like. The characters are developed in the story so it is easy for the reader to discover the strengths and weaknesses of each person. The events flowed from one to the other in a manner that makes it possible for the reader to see history unfold as the book is read.<BR>I enjoyed the book tremendeously. It took a little longer to read this book than usual because of the detail account of events and because their were many characters to follow.

Her parents have died leaving her with her grandparents.The farm is located in the mountains very isolated from other people. Icy suffers from(what we know now as)Tourette Syndrome. Because of her strange actions, she is eventually taken out of school and sent away to a state hospital. I believe Icy grew by the experiences she had while hospitalized. She also made friends she would not have had that helped her as she grew to be a woman.<BR>The story is sad when Icy is treated in cruel ways and mean things are said about her. But, I wanted to stand and cheer when she gained victory over the obstacles placed before her. She is a true inspiration.	2001-09-03

The family moves in with the husband's parents. The plan is for them to stay for a short while until they can get back on their feet, but the stay becomes indefinite. Disfunctional is not the word for both the family and the husband's parents. The whole story is about the way each person handles problems incorrectly. The wife is the most stable one in the house and even she has her difficulties in handling situations.Although, in the end she finds herself and makes a future for her and her children. I did not injoy reading the book. Life has its peaks and valleys. This story never brings life out of the valley. I would have enjoyed the book more if there had been some happy times once in a while. Don't read this book if you are going through a rough time or if you battle with depression. The events and the plot of the story will only add to your saddness.	2001-08-25

I felt Jane's pain concerning the two women who committed suicide;especially her college friend,Connie Bryan. The writer used discriptions that enabled me to visualize the assault on Connie and feel the horror of that evening.  The story drew such a vivid picture of the state of mind Betty Vance,Jane's patient,was in when Jane first saw her. The friendship and concern that was shown by Trixie and Fred for Betty was protrayed in such a way I felt I knew her personally. Not much time was spent on the rapists and their punishment. I would like to have seen more action on that part of the plot. Although, the story is as much about the &quot;baggage&quot; Jane was carring around with her that would keep her from making a good marriage. She would never be truly at piece with herself or the world around her until she delt with her pain. I love the way the writer exposed each of Jane's problems and how they were  resolved. The ghost were a bit hard to take because they were just fanasy to me. On the other hand, I saw the ghost as a tool for Jane to look inward into herself to discover why she was so angry and what she had to do to find happiness. I highly recommend the book. It was wonderful.	2001-08-20
