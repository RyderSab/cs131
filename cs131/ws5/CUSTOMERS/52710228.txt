I thought of it being one of the best books I actually read this year. The reason I was so addicted to this book I think is because of the Rona Leigh Mystery that was going on. This book was so good that it was impossible for me to put down. I was reading at least 3-5 hours a day and on weekends. For me it was a quick read. I highly recommend it to people who love mysteries. I am the kind of person who love books that leave me wanting more at the end of  the story and Love Her Madly was on of those books. I plan on reading alot more of the Poppy Rice Mysteries and also other books that this author have written because they seem to just interest me and catch my eye. Another suggestion that I would give to the author is that this would be a great movie that would hit the top charts. I would surely love to go see it.	2005-07-13

I think that instead of agreeing with the way that gangs are it really helps to show you all the bad things that are involved. I would really like to show this book to the friends that I have that \\"think\\" they are gang bangers or want to be.  He is letting you know that you wont be able to live your own life and that you will be stuck following behind another criminal and stuck doing the things that they do. \\"I hope and pray that other people who secretly live in pain because of sexual, mental, and physical abuse get professional help before they turn around and cause the same kind of lifelong pain and suffering on some one that love, who loves them.\\"(xiv). I really liked this book because of the incredibly interesting events that you don't really hear about every day, the point it is trying to make is positive and influential, and the fact that it is a real story trying to help you prevent the same mistakes. \\"The drive-by shooter hit one of Loca's two kids. I ran to him and cradled him in my arms but he was already dead\\"(2). I also like that he influences you to go to school and try to improve your education to get out and stay out of that life style. It gives really good advice that all of the people on the streets should listen to. I would recommend it because it really helps to get a really good point across that gangs aren't what they say they are and that they are really a lot worse than you think.	2005-07-13

Then after a while i was really into it and I found that it was completely different than I had expected.

The events that took place were interesting and frightening. It was also a story about friendship. The narrator's friends Lolo And Ignacio get captured into the revolution army and then he got them out of the army. &quot;You must get out of the army and become a school teacher like you had dreamed&quot;. Another example of friendship is when Uno is watching Lolo to make sure he does not run from the soldiers. &quot;Uno new without glancing at Lolo that he was thinking 3 men standing around us should I run or not run&quot;.	2004-07-20

As Christina and Terri are driving down the street Christina says, &quot; 'Hey, look at the hitchhiker, he's cute, looks like a killer.' Terri said, 'Christina--I don't like this.' 'What could happen?' &quot;Christina responds. Another, reason why I recommend this book, because it tells that you should never get in car with a stranger. At the beginning Terri tried to tell him it was a mistake. &quot;That's why I was so cruel to you when we first met, I was trying to warn that you got yourself into trouble with us.&quot;  In conclusion, if you like reading mystery books or a scary story for a sleepover I recommend that you read this book.	2004-07-19

It talks about first experiences in high school, the struggles with her classes and teachers, and includes her experiences on the bus. \\"The bus picks up students in groups of four or five. As they walk down the aisle, people who were in my middle-school lab partners or gym buddies glare at me. I close my eyes. This is what I've been dreading. As we leave the last stop, I am the only person sitting alone.\\" She met a new girl named Heather. \\"Another wounded zebra turns and smiles at me. She's packing at least five grand worth of orthodontia, but has great shoes. 'I'm Heather from Ohio', she says. 'I'm new here. Are you?' I don't answer.

Recommendation<br />  I recommend this book to someone who is 12 years and up because it is a true story about the Titanic. There is an another story about friends combined with the story of the Titanic to make the book a little more interesting. These two friends used to be enemies, but are now the best of friends. For example, when they were saved in the lifeboats and everyone was asked to stand up Pegeen shouted, \\"My friend can't stand,\\" Pegeen said to her friend \\"Barry O' Neil, we're to be saved you and I. Hold on now. Don't die on me, for you're all I'll have of Ireland in this new strange land.\\" Another reason I like this book is because of the courage of the few survivors. When they were trapped in the lower deck, they said,  \\"We can go?\\" somebody called. And somebody else said, \\"knock the gate down then.\\" Another voice called, \\"We shouldn't. We're supposed to stay here till they tell us.\\" \\"Don't talk that nonsense any more, man we're going.\\" So if you enjoy a true and realistic story, read SOS Titanic.	2004-07-19

Another reason would be that it was a very interesting story about survival.  For example, any mistake that Brian makes could cause disaster.  \\"Small mistakes could turn into disasters, funny little mistakes could snowball so that while you were still smiling at the humor you could find yourself looking at death\\".  Another example is when Brian tries to start a fire, but does not know what to use.  \\"Clearly there had to be something for the sparks to ignite, some kind of tinder or kindling-but what?\\"  In conclusion, if you are interested in survival and adventure, then read this book.	2004-07-19

Billy's mom died. \\"Ma died that day giving birth to my brother.\\" Billy's mom died because of the fire in which she was burned badly. This is why I recommend this book to older kids. I like this book because when people that are close to you pass away it shows how you can get on with your live. \\"I was invited to graduation, to play the piano.\\" This citation shows that people start to think that Billy is normal, and she can play the piano again.	2004-07-19

It is one of the best books I have ever read. Many books talk about the Americans, but this book focuses on the Japanese Americans who were put into concentration camps in the United States during World War II. \\"When I got off the train, the first thing I thought was they must have let us off at the wrong stop.\\" Ben had said that because he and his family had just got to Mirror Lake, but they did not know that they were being put into a prison. This is a very good book, and I encourage you to read it.	2004-07-19

This is a book that is funny ''I looked at Annie. She rolled her eyes. 'You are living proof that white people have no rhythm.\\" When Eddie writes his poem, he didn't know how to rhyme. One thing I did not like is that for a character in the story to get into the contest, he/she must write a poem to win the contest.\\" All you had to do to enter the contest was send in ten finkle box tops and an original poem about finkles.\\" Therefore this book was a good book. that I recommend to anybody but mostly teenagers.	2004-07-19

I enjoyed reading this book because it was a really good mystery. In one scene the windows in the parlor are banging back and forth without anyone touching them.  \\" STOP!\\" yelled Phoebe.

It also has many parts that are very unrealistic like when the alien said to Jack, '\\"Make this jump.\\"'<br />Then Jack said '\\"I can't it is to high up.\\" 'Then the alien said '\\"You can make it if you believe.\\"' So Jack jumps up 20 feet and makes it. Although this story has many non-fiction parts some aspects of it happen today. For example, the company that framed Jack kills three people in front of him. Then the company said, \\"If you do not do what we say we will tell the police that you killed those three people and you will go to jail for life.\\" These kinds of killings happen all the time. So if you like challenging sci-fi books, this is the book for you.	2004-07-19

If you like mysteries and like to be left hanging, this is definitely a book to read! I liked this book because of the weird things that happened. There are some things that leave you wondering. At one point in the book the old man says, \\"27 and 53\\" and you might think it doesn't have to do with anything, but it appears throughout the whole book. Mike's friend says to him, \\"What's wrong with you?\\" That leaves you hanging because by this point you're so into the book, you want to know what happened.  Even though it's not one of those really important parts but it's a mystery that the author throws in to keep you wondering. But in the end you finally find the answer to all the mystery's and the problems. That was why I liked this book because at first I was confused but in the end it all came together.	2004-07-19

If you would like to learn about the holocaust, its great because this book shows strength, courage and how to make it through the hard times.  I really liked this book because I really liked learning about what happened back then and what went on. Back then the Jewish police would go to peoples house to make sure they were home and they didn't escape. One night Riva and all her brothers are sleeping, and they hear a knock on their door, it's the Jewish police.\\" Riva and her brothers hold their breaths and wait.\\"  The police just wanted to make sure that they were in their house. The book also showed leadership because when Riva's Mother gets taken away, so Riva takes care of her two brothers. The Child Welfare department went to Rivas house to put them in all different homes, but when Riva heard that she was determined to make sure that did not happen. Riva was first thinking \\" Maybe they would be better off and find good homes, be happy .Is it wrong to want to hold our family together?\\" then she thought it over again and said to child welfare ' \\"A mother does not give up her children! A mother does not give up her children.\\"	2004-07-19

Another reason would be that is was a very interesting story about friendship. For example, Sam confronts Linc Solcum and tells him to stay away from her horse and that proving him self a cowboy isn't worth trying to hurt her horse.  \\"Stay away From Him, catching him wont prove you're a cowboy\\".  Another example is that Sam is so committed to protecting her horse she tells her grandmother that she will do anything t save him from Linc.  \\"Gram, I know that the Phantom Is Blackie.  I will do anything to keep Linc away From My Foal\\".  In conclusion if you like horse stories then this would be a good book for you.	2004-07-19

For example, when the pet employ asked her if Winn-Dixie was her pet, Opal said, \\"He's not a pet he's my best friend.\\" Also I recommend it to any one who loves dogs because Winn-Dixie is in many parts of the story. For example, when Winn-Dixie is in the store making a mess, the manager said that he was going to call the pound. Opal said to the manger,\\" Wait that's my dog. Don't call the pound.\\" She said to protect the dog from going to the pound. In conclusion, if you like a book about friendship and animals, this is the book to read.	2004-07-19

This book is funny and at the same time can draw you in with its seriousness.  When he is playing football no one wants to tackle him because they are scared of what his father might do.  \\"I can't explain it right now coach but you have to bench me\\" says Vince.  Yet the book can also be serious, like when Vince and his father are arguing about the problem with Jimmy and Ed  \\"You know who's ripping off Jimmy and Ed so they never got the money to pay you, you are.\\"  You can read this book at any time it is a book that you read for fun and to enjoy.	2004-07-14

In this book he is constantly moving. There is never a time where he is just sitting around.  He is always doing something with the dogs or working on the sled or the dogs and even on himself. \\"As the dogs and I move up the hill with such rage I had to stop and give the dog's some meat and repair the front left ski from hitting something hard and large\\".  He is also always getting injured and cut up. It is very common for him to fall off a sled going 30 miles per hour. If you like those kinds of topics, then I would highly recommend this as your next book.	2002-07-30

Series, Book 1)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	SURVIVAL TITANIC	I recommend this book to kids aged 10-15 because it's a book about history and about surviving a shipwreck. This book has good excitement and suspense, you don't know if Karolina or Gavin will make it alive. This book can help kids in a lot of different situations; such as a social studies test about when the TITANIC sank, also this could actually save kids lives if they are really on a sinking ship.  What if you loved your aunt so much that if a ship was about to sink that you could save your self-including your aunt. Karolina  and Gavin saved a lot of peoples lives by telling people to \\"get to a life boat immediately\\".  This book is a good thriller and I suggest you read it!	2002-07-30
US	52710228	RTLAEYCPY6AMP	0689826990	169528688	Hatchet	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A look inside Hatchet	I recommend this book to whoever likes survival and adventure books.  Another reason is that it has great suspense and action.  When the pilot had the heart attack, no one knew what was going to happen next.  When the narrator said, \\" The pilot stopped jerking, his legs contracted up into the seat and his eyes rolled back until the whites in his eyes were showing\\". This part of the book gave me the feeling that time just stopped because Brian is stuck with a dead pilot and is still in the air.  Brian doesn't know how to fly a plane but manages.  When Brian eats a raw turtle egg that he finds in the sand, this shows his fight to survive.  He is going to survive any way possible.  He has to do some brave things like pulling out porcupine quills out of his leg.  \\"He grasped one of the quills, held his breath, and jerked.\\"  That was brave because they were deep and the pain would so bad that someone could go into shock.  I think that the adventure that Brian has is very well put in the book.  Everything that happens to him and everything that he does is exciting in some way.  So if you want to read a book that has lots of adventure and action in it, this is the book for you.	2002-07-29

It's very exciting because you don't know if Will or Jess will find water or food. It has a lot of adventure because Will and Jess have to travel through sand storms, quick sand, and desert. When Will and Jess go through the sand storm they have to take shelter in an abandoned cave.  It's a very tight space and it's hard for them to breathe. They have to go without meat for days before they find a weak ox, which they then cook over an open fire. I like the characters in the book because they are very independent and different. Will shows his self-sufficiency when he tries to go ahead to look for the rest of his party in the valley.  In conclusion, if you like good adventure and great excitement, this is the book for you.	2002-07-29

Coach Fulton supported Chris during the season to overcome his problem.  \\"He ought to play to beat this thing.\\"  Here Mickey is telling coach Fulton that in order to overcome his problem, he should play basketball.  I learned that anything's possible if you at least try it.  In conclusion, if you enjoy the sport of basketball, you will enjoy this book.	2002-07-29

Recommendation<br /> I recommend this book for all advanced readers.  This book uses hard to understand words like mire. I thing this book is for all high school students that enjoy reading.  I think this book shouldn't be recommended for people 13 or lower. In this paragraph, it shows how hard this book is to read. \\"The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the privilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young minds and of Impressing them with one's own character and ideals, was very dear to me.\\" They also describe with great detail. \\"I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense, white fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction, and banked itself up like a wall on the side of us, low, but thick and well defined. The moon shown on it, and it looked like a giant ice field.\\" I have come to the conclusion that all high school students should read this challenging book.	2002-07-29

This book also explains the cruelties that people suffer with different cultures or religions.  People do not deserve to be exploited from something just because of their religion.  I think different cultures and different religions is what makes this world such an interesting place.  Human nature, being what it is, usually would mean that all people do not believe or practice the same things. \\"I am on the list.\\" This phrase was put in this book and I thought it was quite interesting because it was amazing how much power the Nazis really had over the Jews.  The Jews, on the other hand, hadn't any human rights whatsoever.  \\"Do not give up.\\" I think this was also interesting because if the Jewish people gave up then they would die for sure and they wouldn't live to even tell anyone their horrible story. Everyone has their own rights in this world and they should be able to display them and not be made fun of.  You should read this book and you will learn how cruel it is to discriminate against people just for their religion.  Everyone should be treated equally.	2002-07-25

It is a book for people about 12 and older because of adult situations, like mild violence. The ogre said,\\" how do you like to be cooked? Bloody? Medium?

For example, the book tell you how it can be controlled, in specific it said that people with Diabetes have to take insulin shots, they can drink alcohol, they have to have a diet. \\"Too many empty calories\\" her friend Terri said. My second reason is because the novel shows the relationship between friends. For example when Lacey and Katie fight and then they became best friend again. \\"I'm sorry, about our fight on the phone when you called me at the hospital. You were right about everything you said.\\" I also learn that we all have to accept our selves like we are and not try to be somebody else.

Anyone who enjoys reading mysteries will probably  enjoy reading a Nancy Drew novel.  This book from her series would be a good choice to read. \\"Hello is anyone in here Stephanie? Are you in here?\\" Nancy says this. In this scene Nancy goes to the star's house and gets blindfolded, and there are a lot of people talking. She can't tell who is talking. Even though the book is confusing at times, it is a great book.	2002-07-25

Mike and Tony spend all afternoon working on the dirt bike.

It shows how a teenage boy survives in the wilderness with a psychologist. This book is an adventure book. Before you read The River you should read the first two books. The first two books are Hatchet and Brian's Winter. In The River Brian goes back to the wilderness to teach Derek (psychologist) how to survive in the wilderness. Things go well until a lighting bolt hits Derek. He gets knocked out. One quote that Brian told Derek is, \\" I won't let you die.\\" At this point Brian is very scared because he doesn't want Derek to die. Derek is feeling that he can't save Derek. Even though he told Derek that he wouldn't let him die he still felt worried. One of my favorite quotes that Brian had said was \\" I can't give up\\". This is a good quote because Brian knows he can save Derek.	2002-07-25
US	52710228	R3PA325UOEH9PZ	0140369708	457962814	Game Plan	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Game Plan	I recommend this book to anyone that likes football. It is filled with friendship and excitement. For example, Marty almost broke his arm in the game and Beano would have to use Dave for quarterback. It also teaches you two lessons - always give someone another chance and always believe in yourself. Another example for friendship is between Beano and Mr. Custer. Mr. Custer taught Beano all the lessons in this novel. \\"I know you can coach this team Beano,\\" Mr. Custer said. It's also amazing how in the beginning Marty hated Beano and then in the end they became great friends. Marty said this in the locker room \\" Your no coach Beano,\\" in the beginning of the novel. In the end, after the game he said,\\" We couldn't of done it with out you Beano\\" It's just weird that one-day you hate someone then the next, your good friends with him or her. So in conclusion, if you are into football, friendship and excitement you'll love Game Plan.	2002-07-25

This book could show by giving people reasons how animals can live in peace in Red Wall Abbey and with no fighting.  You could learn from this book how did the young ones survive without eating or drinking anything and they survive. \\"Come one, spoilt baby, little Abbey pet, what are you going to do now, eh?\\"  Slagar made his friend keep on hitting the young ones. Slagars decides who shall live or who shall die. \\"Orlando my good friend, the explanation to it all is merely one simple word: Red wall.\\"  Matthias meant to come to Red Wall Abbey, and live peacefully with us and your troubles will go away.	2002-07-25

Cave-in (Pennsylvania, 1859)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The Book Caved In	I recommend this book to any one who likes to read and have a cliffhanger at the end of a chapter or two. Also, anyone who likes historical fiction would like this book.  One example is when the Coal mine collapsed in Pennsylvania in 1859. Also, I recommend this book to any one who used to work in the mines because it is very realistic.  The main character, Liam, said, \\"You should never light a match in a mine because the coal dust is very flammable.\\" Also, I recommend it for anyone who thinks that girls can't work in the mine, because they can do the same amount of work that the men do only they do it more efficiently.  Liam said \\"he saw a little bit of mischief in Rory's eyes.\\" Rory is a girl who subbed for Paddy, Liam's brother.  I learned that the mine could be a dangerous place to work, not because it could cave in, but rather that your boss might abuse you, such as hitting you with a broomstick.	2002-07-25

This book is a story of friendship and bravery. One of the brave things that Rose Rita did was when she started reading a spell book that would let out a monster, but she couldn't stop reading the book. For example, she was thinking, \\"What was it? A smart person could get out of the trap-if he took every step backwards! That was it! But what did that mean?\\" She was brave because she wouldn't let the monster out. One of the things that Grampa Drexel showed was his friendship. For example, when Rose Rita asked Grampa Drexel this \\"Can I ask you a big, big favor? Will you help Mrs. Zimmerman get her magic back?\\"  This was a sign of friendship because he helped get her magic back. This book should be recommended to anyone who likes mysteries and fantasy.	2002-07-25

The book is interesting because it shows how friendship is made and how friends help out other friends even in tough times. One example is when Kenny comes along and steals the ball from Ben. Mike gets very mad and punches Kenny. He says, \\"Don't take anything from Ben. For example, when they were going to sleep one of Ben's friends died of hunger. Ben was very sad, so he decided to write to his father. He wrote, \\" He missed him and that he wanted to go home.\\" This book is fiction.  It really happened. In conclusion, if you are interested in war, fighting, and sadness, then I recommend this book.	2002-07-25

This book is very good and I think that it would be better for the younger aged kids, around 8 years old and up. This book keeps you wanting to read on and see what happens next. When I was done reading Henry and Ribsy, I noticed that I was never bored while reading. This book is a very easy book to read and it never gets slow.  It's a fun book to read.  The New York Times  says, \\"Ribsy complicates life as only a loyal, bumbling, well-intentioned mutt can.  Few writers for children handle everyday comedy so realistically as Beverly Cleary.\\"  Another quote by the magazine Kirkus  says, \\"Henry's audience is in for more laughs. Another Cleary hit!\\" The magazine Booklist says, \\"Genuinely funny\\".  Those quotes describe the story very well and describe how the book Henry And Ribsy is a fun book to read.	2002-07-25
US	52710228	RGYLRV7Y2L3K6	0689826990	169528688	Hatchet	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Hatchet	I recommend this book to whoever likes survival and adventure books.  Another reason is that it has great suspense and action.  When the pilot had the heart attack, no one knew what was going to happen next.  When the narrator said, \\" The pilot stopped jerking, his legs contracted up into the seat and his eyes rolled back until the whites in his eyes were showing\\". This part of the book gave a suspense that time just stopped because Brian is stuck with a dead pilot and is still in the air.  Brian doesn't know how to fly a plane but manages.  When Brian eats a raw turtle egg that he finds in the sand, this shows his fight to survive.  He is going to survive any way possible.  He has to do some brave things like pulling out porcupine quills out of his leg.  \\"He grasped one of the quills, held his breath, and jerked.\\"  That was brave because they were deep and the pain would so bad that someone could go into shock.  I think that the adventure that Brian has is very well put in the book.  Everything that happens to him and everything that he does is exciting in some way.  So if you want to read a book that has lots of adventure and action in it this is the book for you.	2002-07-25

Well... this has happened to a kid named Andy Zadinski in the novel Wolfrider. Andy is convinced that the call is real, but there is one problem, no one in town believes him, not even his father. When he goes to tell the school counselor, she explains the story of the boy who cried wolf. Then when he goes to explain the phone call to his Dad, he said that someone was playing a joke on him. The police tell him the same thing. One other main reason Andy does not think death is not a joke is because his mother had just died recently, and Andy took her death pretty badly. Since no one believes Andy, he decides to go on an investigation of his own, but he soon finds out that he has got himself into something deeper that he had anticipated.<br /><br />In the book Wolfrider Andy shows us to believe what we want to and to never give up on what we believe in. In Wolfrider this theme runs throughout the story. Andy received a phone call that he believes is authentic, but no one will believe him. In the scene where Andy told his Dad about the phone call, the dad said, \\"Sounds like a sick joke.\\" Andy said, \\"I believed it.\\" In the example it shows that Andy believes the phone call is not a joke, but Andy receives the same response from everyone else he tries to let know about the phone call. So he decides to continue his investigation on his own. Soon he finds out that the phone call was false, but the killer has a plan to kill Nina. If Andy had never given up on his investigation he would not be able to protect Nina.<br />I recommend this book to middle-aged readers, between the ages of 12- 14. I recommend this book to this reading group because I feel that the book setting and plot are a little confusing for any one younger. Also, the way the book is written, a person would probably imagine blood and gore. I also believe that if a younger person reads this book he or she might get scared. For example, when Andy was in the middle of the phone call with Zeke, Zeke tells Andy that he has the body right in front of him.  \\"The man who said he was Zeke could see the body in front of him.\\" Also, I think that you need a good remembrance of details in the beginning of the book to the end of the book. In the phone call Zeke said Nina had a car. \\"She has a car. A red Ford. An Escort. I don't have a car.\\"  At the end of the book he had seen Nina and her red Ford Escort at the park. I really enjoyed reading this book. In conclusion if you like murder plus a mystery, this is the book for you.  Read this book.so believe that if a younger person reads this book he or she might get scared.

Pete does choose the football team which starts to change his whole live. \\" Good job Pete for joining the team and not using drugs or drinking \\".

It should have 2 stars though because in the beginning it needs to have more information about Peter and his life.  On how he has no other family, and how he had to give up his horse for his family.  Besides that the book was interesting. It had a lot of conflicts during the story.  It also had an ending that wasn't what I predicted before.
