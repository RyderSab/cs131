The 16-year-old narrator of Heart's Delight keeps replaying all the scenes from his relationship over and over in his head, even the scenes he wishes he could edit out. \\"This is no gushy, sentimental happy teenage love<BR>story. Or some trashy romantic B-movie,\\" he tells the reader. And, boy, is he right about that!<br />For anyone who's first experience with True Love didn't work out quite the way they expected, this is a heartwarming and at the same time chilling read. No wonder it's won so many awards in Europe!	2003-10-22

She is at the same time talking about getting her doctoral dissertation done in the area of communications. (Yet, ironically, I find her style a bit too unfocused and verbose at times.) It's an interesting perspective on straight people who become immersed in gay culture by developing a network of gay friends--and in this case, two straight people who become very comfortable in that context and become staunch allies behind gay civil rights issues, etc. What I dislike about the book is its tendency to &quot;drone&quot; at times (it is pretty much a diary after all), but what I like is that it offers many important insights from a straight perspective on friendships among gay and straight people. As a gay man whose circle of friends is largely straight, this particular topic has always interested in me. My own coming out experience actually drew me closer to my straight friends rather than straining the friendships (much to my surprise, actually), and I think that this book helps underscore how times have changed and how friendships, good frienships, can transcend sexual orientation. I think this book is well suited to a whole range of people, gay and straight, but I first read it to consider it as a gift to a straight friend, which I did end up giving. Sometimes I think it's helpful for straight people to get an open-minded but straight take on gayness and gay issues and friendship with gay people, and this book is an important contribution to this vein that I think began with &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; on TV. I encourage more writers to explore gay/straight friendships, but I laud this book as an important early contribution to this area.	2001-07-11

Coming out is one of the hardest things I  think any human being has to do--and there are a lot of emotional issues  tied up into it, one being this guilt or shame of existing.

This book will help you repair some of that damage  and find your true, whole self. I am so thankful to Drs.

Orland Outland's new &quot;Coming Out: A Handbook for  Men&quot; is an important follow-up, however: Orland offers much updated  information and covers topics out-of-scope for Signorile. (In his foreword,  Orland says this is an update to Alyson Publications' &quot;Coming Out  Right.&quot;) <br />The first half of the book is all about coming out per se:  his chapters have titles like &quot;Telling Yourself; Telling Others,&quot;  &quot;Your First Gay Social Experience,&quot; &quot;Getting Laid,&quot;  &quot;Going Out,&quot; etc. There is a lot of brutal honesty in the first  half, and a decided lack of nurturing--which may good or bad for you  depending on your personality. (I find it bad.) There is also a tendency to  resort to stereotypes, as though all gay men go out to bars, are confronted  with drug use, etc. It'd have been nice for some coverage that applied to  rural, Midwest, or Southern America--but Orland's generalizations based on  the urban West are adequate.<br />The second half is all about being out, i.e.  building a gay life full of self-esteem and self-security. Here his  chapters have titles like &quot;Gay Subcultures,&quot; &quot;Cops, [...]  Bashers, and Other Dangers,&quot; &quot;Getting Scammed,&quot;  &quot;Organizing Your Support System,&quot; etc. Here, too, it is a  brutally honest style but, as in the first half, full of essential  information. I found the &quot;Getting Scammed&quot; chapter particularly  valuable, as a matter of fact.<br />If Signorile's &quot;Outing Yourself&quot;  should be your first gay and lesbian book, let this one be your second or  third, but take it with a grain of salt--don't forget that you are your own  person and when Orland's advice seems to clash with your concepts of  yourself and your gayness, stick to your self concept.<br />Another book I  recommend for gays and lesbians starting the coming-out process:  &quot;Coming Out of Shame.&quot;	2000-07-02

One thing that happens to straight friends and relatives at someone's coming-out is that the gay person is out and the  family or friends go into the closet. This book explores how family and  friends deal with gayness and how they come out of their closets, too.  There is a briefest of brief introductions that summarizes the stories to  follow, and there is a fairly extensive resource guide in the back full of  addresses and organizations of every kind for information, support, and  advice. If you are a straight friend or family member of a gay person, this  is a great resource--although I think you might also profit from books such  as:<br />Coming Out of Shame--written for gay and lesbian people but for a  straight reader an important and valuable insight into gay and lesbian  people's feelings and emotional difficulties coming out<br />Stranger at the  Gate--if you have conflicted religious views, this autobiography is  invaluable<br />In the end, however, this is a great first step to coming to  understand and support the gay or lesbian person in your life.

What I  mean to say is, there are multiple forms of Christian theology, and each has its own approach to homosexuality. This is one approach. It happens to be a  bigoted one and no greater a breakthrough in theological writing than 19th  century defenders of slavery put together. If you believe literally in  Biblical disprobity of homosexuality as this author does, we must also hope  that you put your child to death for talking back to you, among a great  many other things the Bible advocates. I think most reasoned people and  most mainstream Christian denominations increasingly see that homsexuality  is a genetic state, not a behavior, no more immutable than your eye color.  If you find yourself in a struggle between your religion and your or  someone else's homosexuality, do not begin by reading this book: begin  first by changing churches to one of the countless that are gay-affirming  if not pro-gay.

Homosexuality  is a genetic and biological reality. It occurs cross-culturally throughout  history at about 10% of the population. It occurs naturally in every higher  animal species. It is immutable. If you are gay, skip this text and try  &quot;Coming Out of Shame&quot;--written by two real psychiatrists with  some sense of the scientific method (which, incidentally, was developed by  Descartes who used it to proove that God exists).

At times I was laughing out loud, atother times I was holding my breath aghast with what I wasreading. Overall it's creative and insightful, and unlike anything you've read before. It's divided into four sections: Appetizer, First Course, Second Course, Third Course, Dessert, and a Cigarette. Each is thematically a bit different.  Think of it less as a novel or book as a colleciton of essays. Essays discuss diffferent aspects of Bourdain's life: from drug addiction and first sexual/culinary experiences to his (self-)education in cooking, it's all there. One essay talks about the lingo cooks use, hilarious, another essay is about his trip to Tokyo to adapt a French menu to Japanese tastes and expectations. Another talks about his first experience eating an oyster--analogous to a first sexual experience, by all accounts. One thing that's a bit disturbing is his apparent tolerance of a great deal of homophobia and mysogyny that seems to be replete in the cooking world (of New York, at least). He kind of hems and haws about this, half defending it in a way, without accepting it necessarily. I find that kind of lukewarmness a bit troubling [. . .] But it *does* all make good reading. Always provocative and educational, its entertaining at every step. (Note to publisher: hire a copyeditor to eliminate all those typographical errors next time.)	2000-06-15

On an aside, Schlessinger's writing does seem to  be a bit out of synch with advice I've found in other resources, and upon  further investigation I discovered she isn't a psychologist at all but a  physiologist. That explains a lot really: this is a sensationalistic book  born of her sometimes-cruel radio persona, not a book born of a thoughtful  and well-informed background in self-help and psychology.

Typical drivvel from Laura Schlessinger  who is so out of touch it's painful. I can't imagine giving this book to a  child or reading it to a child. Skip it!	2000-05-12

This dictionary remains my favorite German dictionary. It is complete, contains loads of idiomatic expressions, it's  easy to read, it's vocabulary is up to date (including lots of software and  computer terminology). I recommend this dictionary whole-heartedly. Another  good choice is the Langenscheidt--but Langenscheidt is sometimes too  British, so the Collins is the best option for any American.	2000-05-11

The vocabulary and idioms are woefully inadequate for most everyday translation activities you might encounter. I recommend the Langenscheidt dictionaries or, better yet, the  Collins dictionaries instead--both are a much better value for the money.	2000-05-11

You really do get what you pay for: most students outgrow this dictionary within one  semester. It's main weakness is a lack of idiomatic expressions which most  modern dictionaries, even pocket dictionaries, contain. I recommend the  Collins Gem dictionary instead for a pocket-sized one and the Collins or  the Langenscheidt for normal desk-sized dictionaries. Stay clear of this  one.	2000-05-11

But the fitness information is pretty complete, if biased toward people who are already somewhat in shape.  If you already do a bit of exercise or working out (maybe you play Frisbee  once a week or you walk to work), this is a good starting point for you--if  you are totally not in shape at all, you probably need to wait six months  and then consider this program. The nutrition and hygiene/style sections  are a bit of an afterthought, so consider getting better resources for  those topics. If nothing else, enjoy browing through the photographs of all  kinds of men, hirsute or smooth, muscular or skinny, and become inspired to  improve who you are.	2000-04-28

When I began coming out, I ended up with two copies of this book--the first two people I came out to gave me copies of this book, and both were straight. If you are straight and someone gay comes out to you early on in  their coming-out process and you want to show them that you support  them--this is a great book to give. And if you are gay and want helpful,  level-headed advice about how and when to come out--this is a great book to  get before you begin. Some key things I hadn't realized in coming out that  this book touches on, for instance, is that the order you come out to your  straight friends matters. Who knew? It's chock full of little tidbits of  things you probably never thought about--and viewpoints on things you  probably have thought about. All in all, this should be the first title in  your gay or lesbian library. I can't tell you how much it helped me.	2000-04-28

Straight people may find the text particularly interesting in coming to understand why the  closet exists, how it has manifest itself, and why it is very, very bad.  Signorile has a lucid, provocative style--and each chapter is replete with  intriguing perspectives on how the closet and homosexuals have functioned  in Hollywood and the movies, New York and pop culture, and Washington and  politics. Last is a Gay Manifesto--a kind of challenge for gays and  straights alike to work together to destroy the closet for good. In the  end, this will probably become a canonized work of 20th-century gay and  lesbian writing. It does have a somewhat dated effect on readers today--the  urgency for social change that underpins Signorile's text seems overly  harsh for the '00s. Nonetheless, this is a must-read, absolutely.	2000-04-28

On the other hand, author Laura Schlessinger is a controversial figure. First, note that her PhD is in physiology, not in psychology or psychiatry, so the  &quot;Dr.&quot; that gets her so much attention for her radio show and for  her books (for adults and children alike) is a bit misleading: she really  isn't any more an expert in human behavior and human psychology than you  are. So I'm not sure why you should take her advice with any greater  seriousness than the advice from your friends--who actually know you,  anyway. So keep that in mind. We personally decided to get rid of our copy  of this book when we realized that Schlessinger is the subject of a huge  controversy whether or not she is a bigot. She also has many odd right-wing  viewpoints on the status and role of women in society. The first thing I'd  like my children to know is respect and understanding diversity in all its  forms--and I didn't want this book lying around for my children to call me  to task on some day.  But the first thing I want my children to know is  that I love them no matter what, and Laura Schlessinger doesn't represent  that fundamental message. So, while this is an OK self-help book, its  author represents something unseemly and we have decided that doesn't  belong in our house.	2000-04-25

On this one needs to read the Kinsey  Report and other medical reports on sexuality to better comprehend the  data. In short, 80% of human beings are bisexual to some degree. If you are  one of these people *and* you are religious *and* you wish to fight off  same-sex tendencies in your sexualities, this book may offer you some help.  HOWEVER, if you are actually in the 10% of human beings or so whose  sexuality is 100% gay, then there is absolutely nothing you can do about  it--this book nor any other reparative therapy can change that. God made  you that way, and your best bet is to address your religious convictions in  a gay-friendly atmosphere (which this text is not particularly). So buyer  beware: if you are truly 100% gay, you cannot change your orientation, and  this book will only make you more unhappy, not less.	2000-03-22

It's written in a kind of silted, academic style--but that's no matter. Understanding how gay and straight male friends relate to each other, both in good and bad ways, is a  topic you won't find treated much anywhere else. If you have a good friend  who's gay, or a good friend who's straight, you'll come to appreciate him  *much* *much* more from reading this. I think it makes a great gift, too,  after you come out to someone.	2000-03-13

A theory of pop culture, mass culture, and the (non-existant) distinction between &quot;high&quot; (read: litist) and &quot;low&quot; culture, postmodernism more than any other ism begs a volume of this sort. All the same, Ward's text is a not-so-superficial introduction to the philosophers whose ideas have lead to postmodern critical theory: starting with the structuralists (Saussure, Lvi-Strauss), pass through deconstructionists to poststructuralists...Ward treats Delleuze, Derrida, the Frankfurt School, Jencks, Foucault--and of course Madonna. This text is above no one, and don't resist buying just because it doesn't come in a thick hardcover tome with more italicized philosobabble. If you're interested in postmodernism, this is the place to start. Also suitable as an introductory undergraduate text. Terrific for party tricks as well.	1998-05-18
