Let me say off the bat I own the 2nd book in the Harrow trilogy and plan on reading it...And I'm going to buy Mr. Clegg's newest book when released.  BUT, Mischief was good, just not great.  There was some very interesting ideas he played with, but there wasn't a lot of resolution, and I wanted more.  What sort of power does Jim have?  What really happened at the end there?  I could go on with additional questions, but I will say that a number of scenes were very well done and had me turning the pages at a quick clip.  Overall - good, not great, but I'll keep with Mr. Clegg and his books.  Thanks!	2005-10-10

The Muse Asylum kept me enthralled from page one, as I learned more and more about the connection between the three Princeton grads and Horace Jacob Little.  Loved the \\"twist\\" towards the end, and it makes you think just who is sane and who is a bit crazy.  The story makes you question everything that was written, and I can see myself re-reading it again at some point to see if I can catch any clues Mr. Czuchlewski may have placed.  Very solid debut, and if I can write my first novel half as good, I'll be quite happy :)	2005-10-02
US	42131929	R13FI4K2XKACU8	1871592119	739209308	The Great God Pan (Creation Classics)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	LOVE this little book - wish it never ended!!	Wow, I read this on a plane ride and didn't want to put it down.  Machen did an amazing job of creating this atmosphere of terror and horror and dread and evil...without ever actually spilling blood and showing us what happened.  The way he described what transpired with Helen was awesome.  The way he led us along these different paths and then brought them all home so that everything made perfect sense was brilliant.  I would have loved more of a backstory and more details into Pan...but that's minor.  Can't say enough great things about this little book of \\"terror.\\"  Has something this short and this powerful been written in the last 20 or 30 or 40 years?  Great stuff!	2005-09-23

Mr. Leiber definitely knows how to create scenes of \\"atmosphere\\" and \\"dread.\\"  And I really enjoyed his descriptions of witchcraft and the paramentals.  Maybe it was the slighly abrupt endings, the quick way of wrapping things up that put me off...All I can say is that i've read scarier books.	2005-05-25
US	42131929	R106S672ZSAA0T	0689303173	400011174	The Dark is Rising (The Dark is Rising, Book 2)	Books	4	1	4	N	N	Could have gotten 5 stars...so close!!	I definitely enjoyed the story, especially the idea around the immortals and the dark...but I never once felt the boy was in any grave danger.  Either through the help of someone else, or timing or coincidence, he managed to escape and win.  There were a couple of creepy, dreadful moments that I enjoyed, and the writing was for the most part very vivid and descriptive.  While I understand this was written for kids, I think Ms. Cooper could have written a deeper story, which maybe she has done with the other novels in the story...I'll check em all out!!	2005-05-08
US	42131929	RWTR5RXLZ2QK5	051513175X	59736501	The Descent	Books	4	1	1	N	N	So close to being the ultimate horror/sci-fi/adventure epic!	This was definitely an amazing book to read - once I started I couldn't stop.  Loved the idea of another race of creatures living miles and miles beneath the earth's surface, and the possibility that they might have had a hand in many of mankind's \\"key moments\\"...Loved Ike and Ali and some incredibly intense moments in the dark with the hadals.  Loved the descriptions of the various creatures living miles below us and what life must be like.  I loved his creativity with certain historical reinterpretations and how the Hadals might have fit in.  The reason I don't give this 5 stars is that I felt like the author lost sight of what he set up in the first 100 pages or so.  It seems like he gave up on who/what Satan is and I would have liked to learn more about him, especially in the last 10 pages or so.  I also wanted to learn more about Isaac.  I would have also liked more Branch - he was kind of lost towards the end and didn't really serve any purpose, other than to possibly add something more to the \\"big twist\\" at the end.  Is he or isn't he alive????? <br />All in all, I highly recommend the book - the intense, dark, horror elements were better than most pure horror books I read. <br />Looking forward to seeking out more of Mr. Long's books.	2005-02-08
US	42131929	R29HCQYHT84DGR	0786014776	790921730	Bad Things	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Very creppy, atmospheric, tension filled horror novel!!	I very much enjoyed reading Bad Things.  Love the greenjacks idea, Robin's character, Dakota and the old house with all the secret tunnels.  My one negative is Rick's character - he was way too passive and it didn't seem realistic that it would take him so long to figure out he can truly see the Greenjacks.  And he was so depressive and down on himself.  I understand that the author really wanted us to feel bad for Rick's childhood and all the abuse he suffered...but at times it felt like overkill.  However, the overall story was great and I loved all the \\"little\\" happenings in and around the house that contributed to the overall sense of dread and creepiness.  I'm definitely going to pick up additional books from Tamara Thorne! <br />	2005-01-12
US	42131929	R6NAQ4TS34IFT	0061007226	257277061	The Exorcist	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Very enjoyable!!	I have to admit, this book didn't scare me as much as Hell House (Matheson) or Ghosts (Hynd), but I loved it nonetheless.  By far, the most enjoyable parts, if it's even possible to use that word, was the conversations between the demon and Father Karras.  I loved the way the demon tried to mess with his mind.  And the ending that involved Karras was brilliant.  All in all, a very very good horror novel.	2004-12-24

I definitely enjoyed reading the first Anita Black books, and have just purchased #2.  Many of the characters, including Jean Claude and the Rat King, are quite interesting and I hope to learn more about them in future novels.  I'm also curious to see what Jean Claude has done to Anita!  The one negative I have is that the book wasn't dark enough.  I wanted to be scared for Anita but it never happened.  Also, and I don't want to spoil anything...BUT the way it ended was a bit of a letdown.  I was expecting more of a battle.  The main baddie was a very cool character with very cool powers...Enjoyable nonetheless.	2004-12-01
US	42131929	RI92H0PWEHI2A	0671685635	207023183	Ghost Story	Books	3	2	5	N	N	Disappointed	After the years of hype and hearing about how awesome this book was, I hate to say it but I was very disappointed.  I was expecting an incredibly scary ghost story, and that's not what I got.  If you want to read a truly awesome ghost story novel, check out GHOSTS, by Noel Hynd.  Straub's book was enjoyable and I really liked the interlocking stories involving (without giving anything away) the initials A.M...but nothing ever scared me.  And there were times when his writing lost me and I was unable to imagine what he was writing about.  Ah well...	2004-11-05
US	42131929	R1N1LI57IV2SUV	0843951710	868359128	Possessions	Books	2	12	17	N	N	Just plain bad...	I give Mr. Moore one star for creating something from nothing (I'm working on my first horror novel, so I know how hard it is) and another star for convincing Leisure Books to publish this bad idea of a horror novel...Where to begin?  The 17 year old hero gets his ass kicked so many times in the course of three days that he should have been dead before the halfway point.  And then he wins the lottery and that's never mentioned again - why?  And those aliens/monsters that Mr. Moore seemed to have created from a bad Lovecraft story - the descriptions were horrible and I could never picture any of them.  And where exactly did they come from?  And why were they after the Western Key?  And why did Chris's mom have the key in the first place?  Nothing was explained.  The entire book was a series of fist fights/brawls.  That's all it was.  Bad, just plain bad.  Sorry.	2004-08-26

But I kept waiting for a big payoff regarding Dismas's \\"past life\\"...it never really happened.  All in all, Dismas is a very interesting character, especially knowing all of his disabilities and all he's gone through.  The book is a good, quick read and I'd recommend it...but I kept waiting for more!!	2004-08-08
US	42131929	R2UF0RT0HTN9HP	0525246460	533918267	Demon Night	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Very enjoyable, but could have been so much more!	I love JMS's Spider-man and Supreme Power and Rising Stars comic books, and I definitely enjoyed reading his first book.  However, I kept expecting a bigger payoff, a deeper story, and more engaging characters.  The \\"team\\" that battled the demons were interesting, but I felt that they were very \\"by the books.\\"  What really would have hooked me was more insight into the demons that were hell-bent on taking over the town.  Why exactly did they want this small little town in Maine?  Who exactly was the head demon?  And the ending was also a bit of a letdown. BUT, the novel had enough interesting ideas and cool fight scenes and dialogue that I'd definitely recommend it!  I'd love to see what JMS could do now with a dark horror novel, after years of honing his craft!!	2004-08-08
US	42131929	R3EWF3TX7CSZ99	1894815459	18177880	Sins of Blood and Stone	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Very enjoyable!!!	I would have liked to learn the backstory behind the demons, but otherwise this was a really entertaining book.  Took a little time to get going, but once it did, there was no stopping it!!  I loved how Mr. Urbancik described the Gargoyle's flights around NYC, and the battles that took place with the demons.  Most importantly I enjoyed the Gargoyle's character arc and his reasons for redemption.  I look forward to the author's next novel - I hope it's as engrossing as this one!!!	2004-03-27
US	42131929	R1LKVS5RMHBWP7	0385504209	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	3	1	2	N	N	It was just OK.	I was really expecting this book to rock the house.  I enjoyed Angels and Demons, and especially liked Robert Langdon.  While The Da Vinci Code has some cool ideas, I didn't care one iota.  Langdon became this incredibly passive and boring character with not much to do other than solve a puzzle with his brain whenever the story needed to move on.  There were way too many characters that I didn't care about.  Instead of spending time with Silas the not very scary Albino, I wanted more Langdon and Sophie.  And what's with the 2 page chapters?  I hope Mr. Brown's next book is a bit &quot;deeper&quot;, and more engaging.	2004-03-05
US	42131929	R3K56BMNOI5VJX	1889186325	874949187	Letters from Hades	Books	4	1	1	N	N	I want a sequel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	I really want to know what happens with my favorite damned/demon couple!!  This short novel is begging for a sequel.  Imaginative, gripping, lots of action, creative and a cast of characters that you want to learn more about.  Very interesting take on what Hell is really about.  I enjoyed reading about the different demons and their origins, the creation of the Angels and the possibility of who God really is and what Hell has been created for (or at least Oblivion).  There are definitely story threads that can be expanded upon for a great sequel.  Great book that I enjoyed reading from beginning to end.  Dylan scored big time and so did Mr. Thomas!	2004-02-13

I don't give out many 5 star ratings, but Odd Thomas had me hooked from page one, and more importantly, had me shocked by the last chapter - WOW, what an ending!!  Wish there was more Little Ozzie, but that's fine.  Loved Odd's &quot;voice&quot; - an incredibly memorable character who has to do the right thing, no matter what.  A couple very terrifying scenes, especially the part in Ozzie's house.  Makes me not want to see who's outside my house!  Great story, great characters, great ending -makes for a 5 star book!!  If you enjoyed reading this book, you should check out GHOSTS, by Noel Hynd.  Equally as gripping with a similar ending.	2004-01-31
US	42131929	R3JV3BVLX0YHJJ	0451206878	946670143	The Return	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Very disappointed - was expecting a lot more	I was really expecting to be completely scared.  Mr. Little has a great reputation for writing great horror stories, but this was not a great horror story.  Way too many characters I could care less about, way too many random events taking place that I could care less about, and a &quot;monster&quot; that wouldn't scare my daughter if she saw it.  There were so many bizarre, unexplained occurences that I kept expecting to be resolved and never did.  And the ending!?!?!?!?!?!?  What is up with that?  It was as if Mr. Little ran out of ideas and just gave up.  The best part of reading this novel is that I learned what not to do when writing my own tale of hororr/supernatural.  Thanks!	2004-01-14

HOWEVER, this was a relatively looonnnngggg book that could have easily been trimmed by 100 or so pages.  There were some very nice dark fantasy elements that gave this a bit of an edge over other fantasy I've read.  And I enjoyed Travis's journey (and that of Grace), but I would have liked to read more about Travis and his &quot;pals&quot;, not to mention a bit more action.  Travis came across as too wimpy throughout the entire novel.  Maybe book 2 shows him dealing a little better with his newfound powers.  Grace was a very interesting character, but it wasn't very plausible why she considered herself such a loner, such a social outcast.  Everyone she met was struck by her incredible beauty.  Seriously, how many gorgeous women are social outcasts?  All in all, a fun read, and at some point in the near future I'll have to check out the second book.	2004-01-14

Love this series and love the final book.  I just re-read it to prepare myself for the movie.  As much as I love the books, I'm so glad Peter Jackson veered from the book and beefed up the roles of Legolas, Gimli, in addition to the battle scenes.  Tolkien was one of the greatest creative minds of all time, but he didn't do a good job with the action, nor with Legolas and Gimli.  I do love how he wrote Aragorn, Gandalf, Frodo, Samwise and the other hobbits.  All in all, a great book and a great series (and an amazing set of movies!).  I wish Tolkien were still around to write more adventures.  I would have loved to know what happened to some of those guys and gals!!!	2003-12-20

I finished this book in a couple days - loved the concept of an eternal struggle between these two &quot;immortal&quot; races, but the book could have been so much better.  The best way to describe the writing is to call it simple.  Each chapter was very quick and the 4 main characters had no distinct differences to make me really care for one or the other.  There were some hints about the cop's background that I thought would come into play but didn't.  The construction worker guy was never really developed, and he was the most likeable of all of them.  And what happened to Blake?  He disappeared from the entire book!!!!!<BR>I'll probably purchase Nassise's next book, but I'm hoping it's a bit &quot;deeper&quot; than this one.<BR>All in all, a cool idea that could have been much better.	2003-11-25

I was expecting a nail biting, cliff hanging, edge of my seat read.  Instead, I figured out who the \\"bad person\\" was as soon as they were introduced.  And there was nothing scary about the book at all.  Sure, Holmes and Watson are very engaging characters and I enjoyed learning more about \\"the bad person\\" after all was said and done.  But, I just didn't find anything that special about the story.  Sorry!	2003-10-21

I was expecting a ton of &quot;scares&quot; but only really got a a small handful.  There was an amazingly intense scene involving a dog, and that one scene alone is worth a star!  But, the author spent way too much time talking about &quot;cooking and gardening&quot; that it took me out of the main storyline.  She brought up a number of very interesting ideas and concepts that I would have liked to see explored more, but...and the ending left me a tiny bit confused.  Overall, I would recommend the novel, but it could have been great, when it ended up being good!	2003-10-10

Another reviewer said that this book was missing something &quot;Simmons&quot; and I totally agree.  Song of Kali is a very quick and easy read, and overall it's quite enjoyable.  However, I was expecting something more from this award winner (and why is this book NOT a Horror winner but a Fantasy winner???).  I really enjoyed the ending, or at least the way Simmons ended it, since there isn't really an ending to this book (and I like that a lot!!).  Not your typical smiley face, happy, Hollywood type story, Song of Kali is a definitely gets under your skin...but I was expecting a bit more.  With that said, I'm about ready to start Carrion Comfort - can't wait!	2003-08-12

A creepy, scary, fear inducing, terror filled ride - Summer of Night is a great read for anyone who loves their horror!!!!  Simmons does a great job of introducing all the main characters and ratcheting up the suspense with each page.  I love the scenes where all the boys are hanging out together and acting just like &quot;boys enjoying the summer&quot;, but I was quite shocked and upset at the death of my favorite...<BR>Great novel - I just listened to Mr. Simmons speak and he's a very down to earth, funny &quot;superstar author!! and I bought Carrion Comfort and Song of Kali - all classics by Simmons that I can't wait to read!!	2003-07-25

I'm currently working on my own \\"horror\\" novel and if I can scare half as good as Noel Hynd has with Ghosts, I'll be a happy man.  A great novel - yes, the leads were a bit cliche - detective from small town falls in love with big name actress - but there were many moments in the story where I looked over my shoulder while reading on the couch late at night.  And I did not see the twist coming in the end.  I think Ghosts is the kind of book I'll read every couple of years.  Loved it!!!  Will definitely seek out more of Mr. Hynd's stories.	2003-05-30

I hate to say it...but Bradbury's writing style on this book was not for me.  There were passages I skipped and I felt that the ending was way too rushed.  I would have loved to learn more about the Illustrated Man and his crew - how did they get their powers?  Where did they come from?  The best part of novel was the library scene...otherwise, it was just OK for me.	2003-02-26

I have taken two stars off my rating because I felt the ending was very rushed.  I would have liked to know more about the Illustrated Man, aka Mr. Dark, who was the most fascinating character in the novel.  Also, I don't know if I liked Mr. Bradbury's style of writing for this novel - there were sections where I couldn't follow the imagery and wasn't connecting to what he was talking about.  Otherwise, a very enjoyable, fast paced, thriller/horror story from Mr. Bradbury.	2003-01-27

Loved it from beginning to end - I've read many vampire novels and this is definitely one of the best (right up there with my other favorite - The Keep).  A compelling story told in diary-1st person format that kept me turning pages as quickly as I could read them.  Love Vlad and would like to learn more about his past and how he actually became Dracul.  I will now buy the next book in the series!!!!	2003-01-07

Took me awhile to get around to Hell House, but once I started I couldn't put it down.  Had to finish as soon as possible because the book sucked me in from the very beginning.  I loved the description of Belasco - his teeth, his face, his house - this character rewrote the definition of evil.  The  great thing about Matheson's writing is that he holds back nothing.  No sunny Hollywood endings, which is how I like my horror.  The way he beat down the 4 main characters and the various \\"spooks\\" that took place within the house was brilliant.  If I could write a haunted house story half as good as Hell House I'd be a happy man!  I highly recommend this book!!!	2002-11-17

A very captivating and thrilling story that drew me in from the first beginning.  It was sad to see some of the characters go \\"bye-bye\\", especially one major character that probably didn't need to die...but again, this was a really riveting story that combined elements of sci-fi, action and straight up horror!!<BR>Those Pollards are a mixed up breed if you know what I mean :)<BR>Not for the squeamish!!!	2002-11-12

I now think about Satan, Lucifer, Lilith, Beelzebub, Mephistopheles (by far the best character in the book!) in a whole new light.  It's rare that a novel will actually change the way you feel about something that has been around forever, but that is what Brust has done with this story.  I now have to check out his other books to see if he'll seduce me with his stories the way he did with To Reign in Hell.<br />Lucifer turns around and says, \\"You're nuts.\\" - CLASSIC!	2002-10-16

I like how seemingly random bits of the story all come together to create a very satisfying ending.  The pace and feel of the novel made me think of Patrick McGrath novels and the character of Senta made me at time think of The Magus (one of the greatest books ever!!).  If you like psychological thrillers, stories about people who become involved in situations they had no right being a part of...this book is for you!!!	2002-08-26

I've now read Asylum, Spider, Dr. Haggards Disease and The Grotesque and I would definitely put this one in at #3, behind Asylum and Spider.<BR>This story got me thinking about how awful life would be if you were a vegetable and noone knew you were able to understand everything around you.  McGrath's narrators are always &quot;one sandwich short of a pincic&quot; and you have to think about what's really happening/happened vs. what the narrator said happened.  I enjoyed the story quite a bit, and still have many unanswered questions!	2002-07-22

The main problem for me was the over the top sex scenes.  Sometimes I felt like I was reading porn, and not a thriller/horror story.  I could have done without the graphic sex.  I also wanted to read more about the fairy world - how they came about, Jennet's story, etc...<BR>All in all, a good book that kept me entertained and interested!	2002-07-05
US	42131929	R28IWQSMEH7NP4	0345366239	16404674	The Eight	Books	4	0	0	N	N	I love this book!!!	I've read this book twice now, and have made my wife and best friend read it.  <BR>Ms. Neville created magic with this story - I loved how she put a twist on the lives of all these famous historical figures and wrote a female based \\"Indiana Jones\\".  I loved how none of the characters were who you thought they were, and I'm a fan of the supernatural, so without giving anything away, I very much enjoyed the chess set and the power it holds.  I also like the character of \\"Kat\\" and could easily see her on the big screeen searching through the desert and city streets looking for pieces of the chess service.<BR>An extremely entertaining and thrilling read!!!	2002-03-18
US	42131929	R1306OC763DM9P	0670836850	14546790	Dr Haggards Disease	Books	3	2	5	N	N	Good, but not one of his best...	While I enjoyed Dr. Haggard, it didn't compare to Asylum or Spider.  <BR>For me, the book ended up being about a poor loser who couldn't get over his brief love affair.  On some levels I can relate, but at some point you have to move on.  Dr. Haggard did not move on, and eventually moved even further out there (as you'll learn from reading this book).<BR>I love Mr. Mcgrath's writing and his novels and look forward to more of his work.	2002-02-07
US	42131929	RRHEJWU50UW3A	0425127931	942931748	The Damnation Game	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Captivating, gory, scary - yeah baby!!!!	I'm a big fan of Mr. Barker's (although sometimes I don't understand his images and dream sequences throughout his novels), and I ate this book up in one week (see the Razor-Eater for the pun).  Great characters and a great story that kept you involved from the very beginning - I loved The Last European!!<BR>I can't imagine how this would be turned into a movie - all the gore would have to be excised, but I'll go if it's done faithfully.  I'd like to see Mr. Barker return to his horror roots and write something like Damnation Game, but if not...I could always re-read this one in a couple years.	2002-01-16
US	42131929	RXNNLVBHHGW4R	031286504X	486151984	I Am Legend	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Too short!!!!!  Great story!!!!	WOW - I really wish Mr. Matheson had written a longer version of I Am Legend, because this was one of the best 160 pages I've ever read.  An extremely compelling story that I wanted to continue for another 100 pages (at least!!).  I loved the little twist he threw in concerning one of the characters, as well as how the novel ended.  Mr. Matheson had the guts to end the story in a way that many novelists would never dream of.  And as a nice bonus, I loved his shorter stories - violent, grotesque, engaging with Twilight Zone type endings.<br />I look forward to reading Hell House and other Matheson stories, and I hope and pray that Hollywood does I Am Legend justice when it comes again to the big screen.  Thanks for a great read!!	2001-12-26
US	42131929	RWMRAHG12CW06	0671027360	141370518	Angels & Demons	Books	4	4	5	N	N	What a roller-coaster ride!!!!!	I love the &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; books ONLY if they are well researched and based in some sort of reality.  Angels &amp; Demons is just that kind of book - WOW!!!  Hats off to Dan Brown for what seems like an incredible amount of research and time and planning, cause he's created an amazing non-stop thrill ride!<BR>I loved reading about all the secrets of the Vatican and how people like Galileo and Bernini played a part in the famous Illuminati!!  I now wish I had access to the Vatican libraries and secret vaults!!<BR>Lots of twists and turns, great action scenes and credible main characters made this book a joy to read.  Once I started I couldn't put it down.  Granted, some of the things that happen to our main character (drownings, non-parachute jumpings, buried alive, etc..) stretched the credibility line a bit, but it was all part of the fun and I loved it. I look forward to spending many more long nights with Mr. Brown and his well researched novels - THANKS!!!	2001-12-17
US	42131929	R17ZDE1WLKLT4J	0618002227	669379389	The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, Part 1)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	An incredibly rich and rewarding story!!!	To think that Tolkein created entire languages and histories and races (yes, he created the Hobbits) is just awesome and inspiring!!!  I just finished re-reading The Fellowship to get my mind ready for the movie, and I was very pleased.<br />The one problem I have with Tolkein's writing is that he uses too much detail when describing rivers, trees, hills, etc.. and I found myself skipping lines.  However, I just love Strider and Frodo and Gandalf and Elrond's council and the lands of Lorien and the battle in the Mines.<br />I highly recommend The Fellowship and I'm gearing up for the movie and book 2!!!!!!!	2001-11-28
US	42131929	R2ABM79EGDPLZ2	0812579259	606443502	The Keep	Books	4	3	3	N	N	The Keep is a definite KEEPER!!	A great book that I'd recommend to any fan of the horror genre (with a very tiny dash of fantasy thrown in for good measure!!).  I loved how Mr. Wilson created a truly original spin on the whole vampire legend and how the mysterious Glen character fit into it (I don't want to spoil \\"Molasar\\" for anyone who hasn't read the book yet, but expect some good twists!).  I'm always fascinated by credible and creative retellings of famous legends/myths/mysteries.<BR>My ony complaint is Magda - while I have no problem with her as a character, I had a problem with some of her dialogue.  Sometimes it bordered on cheesy, the way she would describe her love for Glenn, or the predicament she was in.<BR>Otherwise, this is a great book that I can see myself reading again a couple years down the road.  I thank the author for keeping me up late at night watching the shadows for an entire week!	2001-10-31
US	42131929	R7FR68MG4JTDB	0380806576	827347608	Veronica	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A great fantastical/magical read!!	Veronica reminded me of Neverwhere, the great Neil Gamain book that I absolutely love.  I really enjoyed Veronica - this book took me on a magical journey and showed me a NYC that I wish was real!!  I love the character of Veronica, Clement and Tashi!!!!<BR>My only problems with the book was that I would have liked some mre detail into all the twists and turns and magic that went on.  I felt at times that I would have loved some more understanding into how and why certain things took place.  However, this is definitely a great read and I'm on my way to buy Mr. Christopher's latest - A Trip to the Stars.	2001-10-01
US	42131929	R2YSKJ85V49ASR	0395177111	669379389	The Hobbit (or There and Back Again)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	The beginings of a masterpiece!!	In anticipation of The Fellowship of the Ring movie due out this December, I've decided to re-read Tolkien's classics, starting with The Hobbit.  This is a great and classic story about a quest.  It was great to see Bilbo's character evolve from beginning to end, as well as get introduced to all the great characters that populate Tolkien's world.  I loved Beorn and wished he was more integral to the whole story, but maybe he's in The Lord of the Rings (I've forgotten!).  My only gripe is Gandalf - I thought he was extremely underdeveloped and there was so much more we could have learned about him.  As a stand alone story, The Hobbit is a classic, but it just felt like Tolkien was going through the motions and saving his best work for his later novels...	2001-09-06
US	42131929	R2SY7S0EA8RQQR	0440351626	838354674	The Magus	Books	4	3	3	N	N	WOW - What a ride!!	I was not able to put The Magus down from the minute I started, and I think I may have to read it again sometime soon.  What an amazing ride John Fowles has created for us.  It's difficult to review this book without giving all the twists and turns away, but let's just say this psychological thriller has more twists and turns than a rollercoaster.  My only negative for this incredible story is the relationship between Nicholas and Alison.  I'm not convinced of Nicholas's love for her.  Anyway, I highly recommend reading this amazing thriller - a story that will make you think about your own life and those around you.  Who do you trust?  Who do you really love?  Who are you?  Read on...	2001-09-06
