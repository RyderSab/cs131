This is also a chance to bone up on our menu familiarity once we again get to visit. In the beginning of the book, Llamas explains some of the details of the Cuban Table. Next she identifies frequently used ingredients.<br /><br />Here's just a few of the dishes she tempts us with:<br /><br />* A couple of interesting and very simple soups: Avocado Soup made with chicken broth, mustard and lime juice. Her Green Plantain Soup similarly calls for beef broth, lime juice and cloves.<br /><br />* Jose's Ceviche uses king mackerel, onion, lime juice, olive oil and parsley.<br /><br />* Fish in Escabeche is olive oil, onion, garlic white wine, wine vinegar, spices and fresh tuna.<br /><br />* Glazed Sweet Potatoes is a combination of lime juice, brown sugar, cinnamon, butter and dry Cuban cooking wine.<br /><br />* Her Apple-Flavored Banana Ice Cream is a simple recipe calling for apple bananas, lime juice, 7-year-old rum, milk, sugar, light whipping cream and egg whites.<br /><br />* Black Boy in His Shirt is a rich cake made from cooking chocolate, butter, eggs, sugar, roasted peanuts and confectioners' sugar.<br /><br />A Taste of Cuba is a pretty little Cuban book, only 139 pages, but filled with the little country's unique appetizers, soups, main dishes, side dishes and sesserts. Generally, it is a good idea to own a lime tree, if you live in Cuba ...<br /><br /> © Marty Martindale, 2005, Largo FL<br /><br />mm@FoodSiteoftheDay.com	2005-04-05

They were subjective, believing they were objective, bringing off the snob appeal food critics are supposed to exhibit. David Edelstein describes them as the \\"satiny blonde Nina Griscom and helplessly dweebish Alan Richman.\\" The show was Dining Around, described as being a non-cooking show. It was also a fun show and a hook for me with the Food Channel evermore.<br /><br />Richman, eleven-time winner of the James Beard Foundation Award, has been the culinary critic for GQ since 1990. Before that he \\"dabbled in comestibles on the side and under a pseudonym, while writing about sports for the Boston Glove and the Montreal Star.\\" He lives in Mamaroneck, New York and commutes to Manhattan for most meals. He was also recently appointed Dean of Food Journalism of the French culinary Institute in Westchester County, New York.<br /><br />In the books, he posits Food Commandments, a set for Diners and another for Restaurants. The former includes helpful paragraphs on presenting one's credit after dessert, ignoring the waiter's \\"favorites,\\" passing on the omelet stations and more. His commandments for Restaurants include never send a patron to the bar, knocking off the fish boat routine and not being asking if everything is \\"OK?\\" He also offers his ten reasons \\"Why White Wine is Better than Red Wine,\\" not the least of which is \\"Ever notice that winos leave vacant lots strewn with broken bottles red wine?\\"<br /><br />Richman is a world-traveled eating man and acknowledges most everyone envies what he does. At the same time, he defends his expertise as a proven eater while possessing no knowledge of cooking. \\"I believe I know how to eat as well as any man alive,\\" he contends. To expand on this his MO includes behaviors which make him lie, steal, wander and drift usually in silence except for hearty chatter with waiters and busboys.<br /><br />For an example of his mastery at simplicity, we visit a baked potato eaten with is parents in Chicago at a restaurant named Tad's, near the stockyards. The year was early, the price of his steak dinner was $1.09:  \\"fatty steaks reeking with charred goodness. Baked potatoes as big as footballs ... such tubers were unavailable at the A & P ... the potatoes we eat at home were tiny and immaterial ... but the Tad's spud was buttery and vaguely nutty, a combination I don't recall encountering again, even on one of my trips to Idaho.\\"<br /><br />The book is a collection of Richman's stories as they appeared in GQ,  rife with Alan's \\"what to look for's.\\" It's a great out-of-context read, a great airport read, any chapter is entertaining.

In doing this, she has created the first chronological history of vanilla from prehistory paying attention to the growers who over time have patiently grown it.<br /><br />Readers will learn vanilla is a member of the orchid family, evolving more than 90 million years ago. She begins with the earliest Mexicans and Central Americans long before the Spaniards came to the Americas in 1519. Scattered throughout the text are interesting prints from vanilla history and a few recipes, one of which is for an early Mesoamerican drink, Atole Dulce de Vanilla. The simple recipe consists of ground corn flour, water, vanilla beans and honey.<br /><br />Later she tells a story of Creole ladies in Chiapas, southern Mexico who had their maids bring them steaming bowls of hot chocolate to help them endure the tedium of long masses and oratories. This enraged the clergy which led them to attend services in small chapels.<br /><br />Once vanilla was introduced in Europe and the Jewish people, a recipe for Pomteroon Mousse Pie evolved. The crust contained flour, orange rind, ground almonds, oil and orange juice. The filling was made from bittersweet chocolate, eggs, vanilla extract, egg whites and heavy cream. The recipe was printed from the Jewish Cookery from Boston to Baghdad couresty of Malvina W. Kiebman. Geographically, Madagascar, Indonesia and Tahiti also figure prominently in any history of vanilla.<br /><br />Rain dedicates interesting space to early U.S. vanilla brands with quaint prints of the early Watkins and Sauer's vanillas. Her Out of the Cupboard and onto the Table chapter gives much helpful information on the types of vanilla and the proper care of good vanilla.<br /><br />Her most cross-cultural recipe is Chipotle-Vanilla Salsa and Barbecue Sauce. It is a blend of chipotle chillis in adobo, garlic, cider vinegar, olive oil, honey, broth, vanilla extract and lime juice. She adds, \\"It's a marinade or glaze for slow-cooked pork, ribs, beef or grilled chicken ... also enlivens a pot of beans or gives a kick to tofu!\\"<br /><br />Ms. Rain's website is a synopsis of her book at [...] Find vanilla products to shop for, learn how she became Vanilla Queen, interesting topics under \\"Amazing Vanilla\\" and her \\"Culinary\\" section.

Wright<br /><br />Author of A Mediterranean Feast<br /><br />This is an important food book written by a distinguished research scholar, cook and food writer. Wright makes you feel as if you are on-location in the friendly sunny Med when he teaches you why the foods are available, then how the folks there make little snacks with the fresh foods. Wright gives intense scrutiny to all his projects, so much so he dedicated this 514-page book to his youngest son, \\"who wondered when we would again eat `big' food.\\"<br /><br />Here are some of the foods, recipes and color the book is chock full of:<br /><br />One of Wright's many indexes, \\"Cheesy Mouthfuls,\\" contains such muchies as Spanish Baked Cheese Marbles, Gruyere Half-Moons, his favorite, Saganaki and an item he calls Provolone and Mortadella Bombs. He feels Saganaki with a squirt of lemon and a glass of oouzo aside the Ionian Sea is pretty close to what a heaven must be.<br /><br />Under \\"Frittatas and Other Eggy Delights,\\" he borrows dishes from Andalusia, Cordoba, Tunisia and Egypt, noting there are only four countries where Frittatas are eaten: Italy, Spain, Algeria and Tunisia. One eye-catcher is Poached Eggs in Garlicky Yogurt.<br /><br />The \\"Saucy Little Dishes\\" parts are meant to open the appetite and satisfy the soul. These little dishes, little foods, are ever-popular and Wright keeps changing his mind about his favorite, probably most. Try Pork and Pine Nut Meatballs in Romesco Sauce, Carp Croquettes in Walnut Sauce in the style of the Greek Jews. How about Fresh Anchovy in Orange Sauce.<br /><br />Another section is \\"Stuffed Vegetables\\" ranging from zucchini flowers, olives, potatoes to even onions. The Imam (word for a Muslim prayer leader) Fainted is a stuffed eggplant dish, one of Turkeys' most famous mezes, for it is said the prayer leader fainted when he realized how good the dish was. Few recipes gain such lofty titles.<br /><br />In his \\"Filled Pastries, Puffs, Pies and Baked Turnovers\\" section Wright offers the recipe for Spicy Octopus Pie in a Red Wine Crust from the Port of Sete. He offers a care-filled lesson on cleaning an octopus you have caught yourself.<br /><br />\\"Pizzas, Calzones and Empanadas\\" is a sizeable section. His San Vito's Pizza, comes with its own history and calls for pork shoulder, tomato, Italian sausage, salami, cinnamon, cheeses, fennel seeds and oregano. Calzones and Empanadas are carefully described, all being breadish conveyors of tasty ingredients, baked in very hot ovens.<br /><br />His section entitled \\"Fried Tidbits,\\" brings you Fried Kibbe, Mediterranean-Style Fried Small Fish, Fried Stuffed Cabbage Bundles from Catalonia, French Fried Pumpkin with Green Sauce from Naples, Fried Stuffed Olives from Venice and mjuch more.<br /><br />Wright's \\"Seafood Salads and Platters\\" is probably crowned by the Venetian Seafood Antipasto - shrimp, mussels, cockles, little necks, oysters, baby octopus, tuna steak and cod fillets, bearly cooked and served drizzles with olive oil and squirted with fresh lemon.<br /><br />In closing the book would be incomplete without his recipes for assorted sauces and spice mixes. Find Wright's Allioli, Romesco Sauce, Harissa, Ras al-Hanut, Tabil and more. Doughs and batters are there, suggested menus, too. Wright wisely groups the food for certain groups, i.e. A Summer Grill Party with Arab Meze for 12, Passed Appetizers for a Cocktail Party made for 20 - he pulls together many diverse groups and occasions. Interesting.<br /><br />On the purely informal, local, U.S. level, my daughter, JoAnn, has a delightful little habit of walking by you and pressing a little cr&egrave;me brulee ramekin in your hand, one containing a little treat she has made up just for you.

Not surprising, her six pages of Contents runs longer than her remarkably concise History of Soup.<br /><br />Part I<br /><br />Soup Basics containing soup history, proverbs, reflections and some very complete directions and for soup stocks, including the history of and directions for portable Pocket Soup, soup sometimes known as Veal Glue or Cake Soup.<br /><br />In Soup Reflections, she cites an anecdote from Winston Churchill's soup humor:<br /><br />\\"Well, dinner would have been splendid if the wine had been as cold as the soup, the beef as rare as the service, the brandy as old as the fish and the maid as willing as the Dutchess.\\"<br /><br />Part II<br /><br />Soups of Passage celebrate worldwide cultural experiences from birth to marriage and finally, death.<br /><br />Part III<br /><br />Soups of Purpose from Losing Weight to Stimulating Appetite, Wooing a Lover to Treating Hangover.<br /><br />Part IV<br /><br />Soups of Piety and Ritual<br /><br />These take you through the entire calendar and to many civilizations from New Year's Day to year's end and Kwanzaa.<br /><br />Some recipes:<br /><br />On Birth from France: \\"Boiled Water\\" Garlic Soup. This is simply French bread, olive oil, water, 24 cloves of garlic, a couple of herbs and a garnished of Gruyere cheese. With a couple of exceptions, Soups To Celebrate and Recover From Giving Birth \\"are offered in small 'at home' portions, meant to be prepared quickly and served immediately,\\" Solley tells us.<br /><br />On Marriage from China: Red Bean and Lotus Seed Soup - even simpler, this ceremonial soup calls for water, red beans, lotus seeds, tangerine skin and brown sugar. Simple is good.<br /><br />On Marriage again, from France: Blandness has its virtue. Take water, many onions, a few potatoes, tapioca, an egg yolk, heavy cream and butter. This also sounds after a day of extreme stress.<br /><br />Upon death, from France: Combine French bread, chicken meat, carrots, chicken stock and ground saffron.<br /><br />In her Soups of Purpose section under To Lose Weight, she offers a few soup admonitions:<br /><br />Eat soup at the beginning of a meal. Makes you feel full early.<br /><br />Soup fools the body's calorie sensors. This is good.<br /><br />Soup as food is less voluminous.<br /><br />Soup is complicated to eat and takes more motor skills<br /><br />Another Soup of Purpose: To stimulate an appetite -- Avocadolucious Soup Combine chicken stock, heavy cream a chile pepper and garlic. Mix with pureed avocados, experiment with garnishes.<br /><br />Soups for wooing lovers: Aphrodisiac Almond Soup (for two):<br /><br />Combine hard-boiled egg yolks, almonds, raspberries, chicken stock, light cream and honey.

All the recipes in this book reflect my childhood. This is a very personal collection of  recipes and thoughts on cooking, all anchored by the flavors of southern Italy.\\" This is the opening statement in DeMane's introduction. This came as a surprise to your reviewer who found many recipes not usually associated with Italian cuisine. \\"I hope my love of southern Italian flavors and eating and cooking will rub off on you,\\" she ends.<br /><br />Glancing at the Contents, DeMane devotes 64 pages to lining out various techniques which set Italian cuisine apart from other foods. She pairs certain ingredients:  Fennel and Saffron, Pancetta and Salami, Pine Nuts and Raisins, Tomato Paste and Sun-Dried Tomatoes and more. These pairing are a tip-off of what's to come. In addition to the usual sections on Seafood, Soups and Pasta, she includes one on Savory Tarts, Pizza Neapolitan Style, also Calzone. After Desserts, she shares  special menus and her take on \\"My Favorite Southern Italian Wines.\\"<br /><br />Here are some of the recipes she includes in this complete book:<br /><br />Wheat Berries with Zucchini, Pine Nuts and Ricotta<br /><br />Plum Tomatoes Baked with Caprino, Rosemary and Black Olives (Caprino is the Italian word for goat cheese)<br /><br />Baked Eggs with Winter Tomato Sauce<br /><br />Coleslaw with Sicilian Flavors<br /><br />(these include pine nuts, raisins, peperoncino chili, sugar and nutmeg)<br /><br />Tuna Tatare Crostini with Capers and Avacado<br /><br />Mussels with Mascarpone, Green (shoots) Garlic and Spring Herbs<br /><br />Steak and Celery Salad with Capers and Romaine<br /><br />Duck Pizzaiola with Red Vermouth<br /><br />Pizza with Escarole, Fontina and Baked Eggs<br /><br />Chicken Soup with Pumpkin, Escarole and Marsala<br /><br />Dried Figs with Almonds and Chocolate<br /><br />The arrangement of recipes in menus at the end of the book are clearly foods expertly prepared for other fine Italian cooks.

It's also a very quick catchup if you have been totally out of the kitchen for the last decade or two. It's the Mediterranean scene, not the Asian scene, however. The book contains many recipes, great ones, too.<br />Author, Ari Weinzweig, no not Ari Zingerman, taught himself to be very food savvy, and he's graciously willing to share  his self-taught connoisseurship methods through this book.  Though a Chicago native, Ari went to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Michigan where he had to decide on a major and stumbled into the food business at a the lowest end. Finally he and a partner thought the Ann Arbor area could support another deli, for who doesn't hate to leave their college town!<br />Many think the original delicatessens were markets selling Jewish/Kosher foods, the loxes, earliest sour creams, delightful pickles and to-die-for hot pastrami. Not so. It seems Germans, not Eastern European Jews, opened New York's earliest deli. Actually, the dictionary definition of a deli is: \\"a small shop that sells high quality foods, such as types of cheese and cold cooked meat, which come from many countries.\\"<br />Naming the new Ann Arbor deli was a challenge for the new  partners. Ari knew \\"Weinzweig\\" would be difficult for customers to pronounce much less remember. After a fashion, they agreed on \\"Zingerman's\\" for their Jewish-sounding store name, vendor of Mediterranean delights. They laughed, because the name had, \\"Zing,\\" and they opened their new market in 1982.<br />When Weinzweig works to make you a greater discerning  connoisseur, he calms you with, \\"How to overcome your fear of the guy behind the counter.\\" Most of this means, \\"feel entitled to the sample you are offered,\\" or downright ask for one (else how will you ever learn?). Then he gets scientific and devotes sections to:<br />1. Introduce yourself to the new food (this can be done silently)<br />2. Look at it, describe its color (privately).<br />3. Smell it, \\"The nose knows what it's doing,\\" he claims.<br />4. Taste it. Move it around in your mouth, discover how it tastes differently in different part of your mouth. (think like a wine taster ... Legs? Woody? Bold?)<br />5. Next he admonishes, Afford the best\\",\\" (he's not paying).<br />Weinzweig winds up his connoisseur training with, \\"Go wild. Taste early, taste often, and above all, have fun!\\" He then gets serious and confesses, \\"I'm convinced that smaller quantities of better-tasting raw materials will buy you more satisfaction for the same, or even less, outlay.\\"<br />Ari devotes 23 pages to olive oils opening with a Greek proverb: \\"Without oil, without vinegar, how can we take a trip?\\" His quick olive history is a world adventure. Nut oils are also in, and he gives careful particulars for Pumpkin Seed Oil \\"Green Gold from the Austrian Alps.\\" His recipes for Tuscan Pecorino Salad with Pears and Provencal Mashed Potatoes  are only two of the recipes in this chapter.<br />When it comes to breads, Ari Weinzweig waxes almost romatically. Crusts are a big thing with him, and he's totally opposed to plastic bags for bread. He even lines out all the basics and fixin's for a fun bruschetta party. His defense of anchovies (two pages) is noble. He offers his Bread and Tomato Salad recipe. It calls for pine nuts, sea salt, Banyuls wine vinegar, toasted almonds, piquillo peppers and other delicious ingredients. Of the special vinegar from French Pyrenees, he states, \\"It's subtly sweet, softly spicy with a touch of almond, almost a whisper of dark chocolate and a hint of aged sherry.\\"<br />Ari's section on pasta is as entertaining as it is informative. He ponders your choices between dried pasta and fresh  pasta.All pasta shapes have a reason, and he helps you decide what you need for a particular dish. His visual glossary is handy, too. He explains pasta's cousin, polenta, and his recipes take the mystery out of it. No lesser cousin is risotto, or Spanish rices, and he detours a bit for Minnesota's  Ojibway wild, wild rice compared with latter-day paddy rice.<br />Cheeses run the gambit from parmigiano-regiano, cheddar, mountain, blue and goat cheeses. He looks at \\"Cows and Curds,\\" and the knotty area of aging. He explains Mountain cheeses as \\"... were created out of a common struggle to deal with the difficulty of life at high altitudes, ... huge snowfalls in Switzerland, Italy eastern and western France and Greece.\\" He expounds on their personality and character. He also answers that thorney question, \\"What makes blue cheese blue?\\" He defines many blues from many countries.<br />Ari's big on Prosciutto de Parma and Spanish Serrano Ham. Besides these and Salamis, he addresses salmon, both of  farmed and non-farmed origins. He defines Lox and smoked salmon, as well.<br />When it comes to seasonings, Zingerman's gets very basic: Pepper-milled pepper, sea salt and that very expensive stuff, Saffron. That's it. Ari makes Saffron read lore like an Italian fairy tale: \\"Seeing the Saffron harvest...\\" \\"Field of Dreams, From Bulb to Stigma, Culling the Crocus, At Home with the Strippers, Toasting\\" and finally, \\"Lunch With the Man Of Lamancha.\\"<br />Vanilla and chocolate get their due. The book includes a very interesting two-and one-half-page chocolate timeline and a section, \\"Turning Beans into Bars:  How Chocolate is Made.\\" Zingerman's Guide to Good Eating gives us much to digest.

Further, it was probably pale red, mushy and you liked the nearby enchilada better.<br />Tamales become gourmet, fusion cuisine in this book, and your ideas for more can be endless. Basically think of a tamale as a house in structure. It has its foundation, living rooms and finally the roof. With tamales the foundation is a corn husk wrapper  lined with masa dough, the living area is the filling and the roof a tantalizing sauce. Tamales can be vegetarian, seafood, poultry, any meat or desserts, depending on ingredients. Tamales, the lined corn husk wrapped around and filling and cooked over steam.<br />The masa base for the dough is large-kernel corn which looks like hominy. It is dried, cooked in limewater, drained, dried again and ground into flour. You can also purchase it, then proceed with one of the book's intriguing flavored masa dough recipes. Some variations include:<br />Roasted Corn Tamale Masa Dough<br />Wild Mushroom-Chipotle Tamale Massa Dough<br />Red Thai Curry Tamale Massa Dough<br />Habanero-Blackened Tomato Tamale Massa Dough<br />plus many more.<br />Just a few of the filling and sauce recipes are:<br />Wild Mushroom and White Truffle Tamales<br />Artichoke and Sun-Dried Tomato Tamales with Olive Oil and Saffron<br />Salmon Tamales with Red Pepper Masa and Mole Amarillo<br />Shrimp Tamales with Ranchero Sauce<br />Clam Tamales with Fennel and Chayote-Melon Salsa<br />Chicken Tamales with Mole Poblano<br />Duck Tamales with Pineapple and Chipotle<br />Bittersweet Chocolate Tamales with Anchos, Prunes and Raisins (one of several dessert tamales)<br />Apt headnotes identify newly-introduced ingredients and clarify each recipe's mission. Helpful, too, is the book's section, Basic Recipes, Sauces, and Techniques. In it they cover such steps as blackening tomatoes, tomatillos, chiles, and onions. It also goes into how to process chiles, toast herbs and spices and make delicious stocks.pes, Sauces, and Techniques.

It's a chance to learn more about the people these explorers encountered, how they dealt with hardships, get to take a look at their provisioning and read actual quotes from Lewis and Clark, themselves.<br />Perhaps Gunderson's chapter titles tell the most about her careful research:<br />Jefferson's Vision, Washington, D.C.<br />Lewis Receives Instructions and Buys Provisions<br />Anticipation and Preparation, Down the Ohio to Camp Dubois<br />High Spirits, Up the Missouri<br />Buffalo! Diplomacy with the Yankton and Teton Sioux<br />Sacagawea, Charbonneau and Jean Baptiste Join the Expedition<br />Another Beginning, the Upper Missouri & Great Falls<br />The Journey Hangs in the Balance, Over the Mountains<br />Wild Roots, Elk and a Whale, Ft.

A partial list of Philadelphia provisions spread the course from 32 tins, or 193 pounds of portable soup, assorted fish hooks, kettles, a corn mill, hatchets, a whetstone, gun powder and castile soap.<br />Thomas Jefferson, widely known for his food and agricultural expertise, not only wanted detailed maps and topographical reports about the Louisiana Purchase, he asked that the explorers extend every courtesy to people they met but to record how they grew crops, fishes and hunted. He asked them to observe their \\"food and domestic accommodations.\\"<br />\\"As they made their way west, the pair and their trailmates sampled everything from Indian corn and buffalo tongues to camas roots and dried salmon,\\" noted an author and filmmaker, Dayton Duncan. There is a good deal of information on Portable Soup or Pocket Soup, the fine at of making Hoe Cakes, building a special fire to cook a bear, making hominy with corn, lime and wood ashes and the making<br />of William Clark's Birthday Fruit Salad. Other crafts of the trail included Spoonbread, dishes like Roasted Buffalo, Turnip and Berry Ragout also  Pemikan made with Juneberries and buffalo berries. Other hearty meals were Hazelnut Cornmeal Pancakes, Roasted Parsnips with Pine Nuts and Fort Clatsop Salmon Chowder with fennel and sourdough biscuits.<br />Named the Official Cookbook for the National Council of Lewis & Clark Bicentennial, the author states, \\"History is as close as a bite of buffalo jerky or a taste of hominy.\\" This attractive, well-indexed book with deckle-edged pages, helpful maps and pleasing sketches, contains over 80 authentic recipes faithfully tested and re-created  for today's kitchens.

BOWL FOOD:<br />Comfort Food for People on the Move.<br />Published by Laurel Glen of San Diego<br />Basic in concept, bowl food has been around for hundred's of years, just now moving into North America. Many primitive people used half coconuts or gourds to hold their food. Although we have evolved to the use of flat plates, knives, spoons and forks, we should no longer think of bowls as necessary only with breakfast cereals, stews, and soups. Bowls are no longer the exclusive domain of Asian cultures.<br />People have shortened time in their lives these days. When making most bowl foods,complete all your chopping to bite-sized pieces before cooking. Separate into piles which cook in similar lengths of time. Cooking time for most recipes is brief. A lite, balanced meal in just one bowl, nestled into the palm of your hand makes for a cozy time at the computer or TV. Forget knives, formal tables with chairs -- maybe use a pair of chopsticks to keep your expertise alive.<br />It should be noted Bowl Food is an edited compilation of recipes, a collection from many food professionals. Each turn of almost 400 slick pages reveals a full-color picture of the finished bowl while opposite stands its easily understandable recipe. This is an excellent way to eat a lot of fresh, barely cooked veggies and maximize your nutritional intake.<br />Bowl Food's Contents include soups, salads, pasta dishes, rice, wok-stir fry, curries also one-pots. Some selections:<br />§ Spicy Squash and Coconut Soup rather crosses the Asian with the sturdy squash.<br />§ Pea and Arugula Soup is a lite, quickly-made health meal.<br />§ Shrimp, Potato and Corn Chowder smacks of New England.<br />§ Ramen Noodle Soup with Roast Pork and Greens, utilizes left-overs in simple, easy Asian dish.<br />§ Crab and Spinach Soba Noodle Salad is a delicately flavored salad simply made.<br />§ Pasta with Seared Shrimp  includes red chilies and capers.<br />§ Madras Beef Curry is simple and transforms skirt steak into a rich dish.<br />§ Chicken and Mushroom Pilaf blends mushrooms, almonds and yogurt.<br />§ Shrimp and Snow Pea Stir-Fry is light, tasty and quick to make.<br />§ Spicy Sausage Stew is but one of the \\"One Pots\\" dishes in Bowl Food.<br />§ Chicken and Asparagus Risotto marries distinct flavors into a well-balanced meal.<br />§ Tomato Bread Soup reminds us of Italy.<br />§ Caramelized Onion and Parsnip Soup smacks of root cellars of New England.<br />Review by Marty Martindaleo a rich dish.<BR>§ Chicken and Mushroom Pilaf blends mushrooms, almonds and yogurt.<BR>§ Shrimp and Snow Pea Stir-Fry is light, tasty and quick to make. <BR>§ Spicy Sausage Stew is but one of the \\"One Pots\\" dishes in Bowl Food.<BR>§ Chicken and Asparagus Risotto marries distinct flavors into a well-balanced meal. <BR>§ Tomato Bread Soup reminds us of Italy.<BR>§ Caramelized Onion and Parsnip Soup smacks of root cellars of New England.<br />Review by Marty Martindale	2003-02-21

The major conquerors were the English, the Spanish, the Dutch and the French. Each island's blend also represented the ethnic background of imported laborers to work their back-breaking sugar fields. These workers came from India, Asia and Africa and each brought their eating habits and usually some seeds for the future. Additionally, the  Amerindians, or original inhabitants, had simple fare which mixed in with the ways of conquering cultures and in-coming laborers. This three-way juncture created foods and ways available no other way. The book contains some recipes.<br /><br />  Fruits, often beautiful and exotic, grow abundantly on the islands, and the book goes into some detail about many of them.  A rum factory is usually found on many islands, for it is an important byproduct of sugar, so is the manufacture of a local beer. The many fruits lend to signature Rum Punches. Fruit shows up frequently in main dish recipes, as well.<br /><br />  In a land of islands, it stands to reason fish and seafood figure highly in the Caribbean region diet.  Herbs and spices grow abundantly too which causes the people to depend upon them for medicinal reasons and bush teas in addition to seasoning food. West Indies grown nutmeg, mace, ginger and garlic add to the flair of local cuisines. Chile peppers, coconut and island-grown spices dress up local foods, while basic beans, rice and tubers balance a rich diet.<br /><br />  Look up festivals and carnivals which are big in the islands, some named \\"Crop Over,\\" celebrating the completion of the sugar harvest.  Others are cook-offs and those associated with the Lenten season. A quick catch-up is the book's green inserts entitled, \\"Don't Miss,\\" which line out sights as well as foods to try. Some random samplings:<br /><br />Dutch:<br /><br />Curacao, Aruba, Bonnaire and Sint Maarten - Dutch cheeses, iguana soup, Indonesian and Papiamento cuisines.<br /><br />French:<br />Guadeloupe, Martinique and Haiti, French-influenced with wines from France, spicy Creole fish dishes, fresh baked goods. Hatian music is especially lilting.<br /><br />English:<br />Jamaica, ackee & salt fish, jerk pork with recipe<br />Barbados, its coo-coo and flying fish<br />Trinidad, roti, hot curries, callalloo soup, cou-cou (cuscous),<br />Nassau, conch<br /><br />Spanish:<br />Cuba, pizza, jamon (ham) chorizo sausage and onion<br />Puerto Rico, sofrito<br /><br />The Food Directory is broken down into upscale, pubs and mid-range, fast food/cheap eateries, street food and bars. Catchy island music is to be savored on each island  from Jamaica's Bob Marley to Trinidad's Mighty Sparrow.<br /><br />The book's  Fit and Healthy chapter discusses your health and what to look out for particularly if allergies, diabetic issues and diarrhea intervene.<br /><br />Just reading World Food Caribbean's \\"Eat your Words,\\" quick 30-page Culinary Dictionary will put the visitor way ahead of the Caribbean food game.

Who is Wildman?<br />A.  Good-natured, with a sense of humor, Steve Brill has been guiding foraging tours in and around New York since 1982. He enjoys telling the story of how he was arrested and handcuffed by undercover park rangers for eating a dandelion in Central Park, a food resource area he highly supports. He's lectured in  schools, for youth programs, museums, libraries and environmental groups for years. Brill is also a foraging and natural-cooking expert whose new cookbook teaches you to use nearly 150 of America's finest wild food plants to prepare tasty meals.<br />Brill does caution and wisely so:<br /> \\"It is the reader's responsibility to identify and use the information in this book sensibly.\\" He sums up the 29 pages of pre-foraging information with an admonishment to pay particular attention to correct identification of foods in the wild and recommends the additional use of his book, Identifying and Harvesting Edible and Medicinal Plants in Wild (and Not so Wild) Places.<br />A TRIP THROUGH THE BOOK<br />The Wild Vegetarian Cookbook starts by introducing wild and purchased natural foods and basic methods for preparing them. He gets into seasonings, tips on adapting natural ingredients to traditional cooking methods and explains how to harvest wild foods safely.<br />Next he goes into recipes for \\"unwild foods.\\" Tofu-based cheeses are basic to many of Brill's recipes, and he presents his recipes for Tofu Cream Cheese, Tofu Cottage Cheese, Tofu Sour Cream, and the like.

She bases her selections on how she feels they will become an enjoyable learning experience as well as a fond memory. Richard Gillette's splendid photography makes this a feast of photos, a collection to keep and share.<br />Allegra's book is filled with winemaking stories and local history. Each property, with its ancient and contemporary art, fills ivy-covered halls, Victorian landmarks and ambling chateaus. These are mixed amongst magnificent castles, an old California abbey and a Greco-Roman temple. Humble mission abodes and California plantation homes lend their appeal, as well.<br />Allegra devotes a separate chapter to each winery, with  a side bar telling access details, hours of operation, tasting times -- charges, if any -- types of wine offered and website information. She also indexes each winery as to region, town, visiting seasons and special attractions. In a section entitled, Triangle Tours, Allegra suggests three easily seen wineries during a single day's Napa Valley outing.<br />This Guide is as beautiful as it is helpful.  (end)	2001-05-08

With the  towns she has chosen for the book, she makes each seem a bit like a trip to  another land, and in some cases, it almost is.  This is not a guidebook in  the traditional sense with lots of restaurants, B &amp; B's emboldened in  most every paragraph. Instead, Hattes uses her gift to blend history with  the curious. This is not to say she neglects information on some of  Wisconsin's fascinating annual fairs, events, celebrations and their  origins. Each destination chapter ends with phone numbers for &quot;Places  to See, Eat and Stay.&quot; The book is well indexed.  Her opening chapter  concerns the town of Spring Green where Frank Lloyd Wright was a large  presence. She describes places a visitor would want to see and how he was  invited to get involved in each project. We gain a little insight into his  personal life, as well.  The rails and trails of Elroy and Reedsburg, also  Norman Rockwell territory, share another chapter. You'll learn Bicycling  magazine ranked this area's bike trails in the top three in the nation. One  of Rockwell's museums is in Reedsburg where all of his magazine covers from  Saturday Evening Post, Literary Digest, Country Gentlemen and Life magazine  covers are on display.  Hattes' Lake Geneva and Delavan chapter,  subtitled, Playboy Bunnies and Circus Capital, is a great glimpse into the  history of this resort area. In the following chapter, she captures the  flavor of Wisconsin's Road America area of Elkhart Lake and the history of  being pampered by plumbing at Kohler Co.'s so-carefully planned employee  community There's also a Celebration of Chocolate feast each year.  In her  chapter, Washington Island, Looms and a Stavkirke, Hattes tells of this  23-square-mile island of fields and forests which is the oldest Icelandic  settlement in the U.S. It's also home of the Sievers School of Fiber Arts  where 600 students come each summer to nurture their craft.  From the  drumbeats and moccasins of the Ojibwe Indians of Lac du Flambeau, Hattes  takes you to the lumber, iron ore and snow country of Hurley and Montreal,  Wisconsin. In Trempealeau County the Trempealeau Hotel still stands. This  Mississippi River town is the originator of walnut burgers.  In the  chapter, Maiden Rock, Stockholm and Prescott: River Country Sampler --  Birds, Art and Antiques, Hattes says of the guests at the Harrisburg Inn  B&amp;B, &quot;They awaken to the sound of train whistles and migrating,  trumpeting swans. In summer they breakfast on the porch watching the antics  of hummingbirds and pelicans while bald eagles and turkey vultures soar  overhead.&quot;  Hattes ends the book with her chapter, Madeline Island,  Bayfield and the Apostle Islands.  Here the reader can pretty well think a  week in Bayfield at the &quot;Carnegie Hall of Tent Shows,&quot; otherwise  known as the Lake Superior Big Top Chautauqua, might well be the be-all and  end-all escape from the workaday world. Wisconsin's senator Gaylord Nelson  tabbed the Apostle Islands, as &quot;emeralds scattered in a sapphire  sea.&quot;  Unlike most books for travelers, Country Towns of Wisconsin is  a good cover-to-cover read, even if you plan no visit to Wisconsin in the  near future. ###andic  settlement in the U.S. It's also home of the Sievers School of Fiber Arts  where 600 students come each summer to nurture their craft.
