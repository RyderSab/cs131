Some of the &quot;happy couples&quot; they mention have split-up, and several people have passed-on.<br />I wasn't aware this book existed until recently, and that is strange, considering I am a die-hard traditional country music fan.<br />However, sometimes it was annoying to read about Lorianne's talking about herself.  She tried to appear &quot;modest&quot; but was forever going on about compliments people bestowed upon her regarding her looks.  This isn't a book about her &quot;beauty&quot;--it's supposed to reveal insights about country music performers.  Charlie Chase came across as a much nicer person than Lorianne did.<br />This book was so-so.  I learned a few things I didn't know before, but for the most part, it was re-hashing facts I was already aware of.	2003-12-02

I happen to know who Beth is and have lived in the same town she does, for many years.  While her sister, the author of this book, makes it look like only a handful of busdrivers and fellow passengers are annoyed by Beth, it's really the other way around.  The majority of drivers and passengers do NOT like her.<br />Don't get me wrong--they sympathize with the fact that she is mentally retarded; however, that doesn't mean she's stupid.  She knows full-well what she is doing and saying, and it seems she loves to irk people by boasting and bragging that she \\"doesn't have to work\\" while all the rest of us are on our way to work when we hear this on the bus.  <br />Being a witness to what Beth does, daily, it bothers me that the readers of this book will think she is some type of \\"hero\\" or that she is well-loved.  Neither is true.  I've witnessed an elderly man send her blocks away to buy him a soda, just so she would MISS the bus they were both waiting for.  He didn't want to put up with her on the ride home.  If you're into fairy tales, I guess this is the book for you!	2003-08-21

I'm glad someone finally wrote an in-depth, interesting biography of one  of my favorite people.  This book was created out of research and  interviews with many, many people who knew Bill.  I didn't find that it  &quot;tarnished&quot; Bill's memory in any way.  It only portrayed him as a  human being that we could come to know through the written word.  I  &quot;knew&quot; Bill from seeing him at countless concerts in the '80s and  '90s, and although he didn't know me by name, he always went out-of-his-way  to be wonderfully kind to me.  I don't forget those things, and I miss him  terribly.  My biggest regret is that I didn't have the opportunity to know  him better, but through this book, it seems I do now.  Reading this  biography will only reinforce the fact that he was a great music legend,  but will also show the reader he was a human being, just like the rest of  us.  That is so important, because those &quot;stars&quot; are just like us  in many, many ways.	2000-08-03

From all I've heard and have been told, Landy \\"brainwashed\\" Brian at one point in his life, so who knows WHAT the truth is in this book?  I can figure pretty much of it out, as far as  facts about Brian's troubles and condition; however, Landy seems like a  character with a lot left to be desired.  I am so thankful that Brian  emerged triumphant through all of his problems, but I would rather give  that thanks to God than to Eugene Landy.  I guess when reading this book  the reader has the option to distinguish fact from fiction.  It isn't  always easy.  My review is quite vague, because I was left puzzled by what  REALLY happened during Brian's association with Landy.	2000-06-16

This book is an absolute must for anyone who is (or isn't) a fan of Tammy Wynette.  It was so riveting that I finished it the same day I received it.  It tells the story of Tammy's life--and extremely mysterious death,  focusing on the latter.  It also clears up some myths and misconceptions  that have built-up over the years.  One example is the  &quot;kidnapping&quot; which occured several years ago.  While the finger  of blame was pointed at certain individuals (and as a personal aside, I  never believed a particular individual was at fault, and that is confirmed  here) the REAL story about the kidnapping is shocking and will jolt you.  I  recommend this book to anybody and everybody.  There are still unanswered  questions about Tammy's death, but short of a confession, we may never know  the truth.	2000-05-03

I believe the author tries to &quot;talk&quot; and &quot;think&quot; like  Andy; yet, it comes across as juvenile, intelligence-insulting, and very  hard to follow.  I think he tries too hard to NOT follow a general writing  style, but he fails.

While Leamer may not have gotten all of his facts straight, I believe that the people who are offended by this book are only offended because they have to face the truth about their &quot;beloved&quot; &quot;new  country&quot; stars.  I wouldn't call many of these singers in this book  &quot;country&quot;, to begin with.  They &quot;used&quot; country as a  vehicle to get their foot in the proverbial door to establish themselves as  pop artists.  In the heydey of Cash, Jones, Jennings, Nelson, etc., these  people didn't hide their dirty laundry.  They aired it, and admitted their  wrongdoings.  These &quot;new country&quot; stars want to appear as angels.   As a very famous country singer said (and I may be paraphrasing here),  &quot;These younger stars don't live cleaner lives than the older ones  did--they just live their lives more secretly.&quot;  That is &quot;THE  TRUTH&quot;.	1999-12-20

Unlike the recent autobiography by Tom Carter, this is the book you want to read to get an in-depth, detailed look at the life of Merle Haggard.  It's funny, touching, interesting....all kinds of emotions rolled-into one  book.  The reading is easy, yet it doesn't gloss over the events in Merle's  life.  It is much more interesting and educational than the new book that  is out.  I highly recommend it.	1999-12-14

This was very in-depth and interesting; which I found this book totally opposite of.  There are parts of this book which you know are Merle's  words, and others, which are clearly Tom Carter's.  There, it's an  inconsistency.<br />Merle chooses to delete certain information which he  reveals in his first biography, so therefore, it really isn't a secret.   Also, some of the language used in this book is deplorable.  The point can  be well made with those words omitted.<br />Overall, I prefer his first book.   While that one only extended to a certain point of his life, it was  better-written and held the reader's interest much better.  This book  should've been written the same way, and picked-up where the other one left  off.  Instead, it rehashes old facts which we already know.	1999-12-13

I read Mary's book first, and the parts in the Diana Ross book pertaining to the  Supremes, almost all matched Mary's quotes, exactly.<br />I didn't feel like I  learned too much, and since this is an &quot;unauthorized&quot; biography,  I feel that one cannot tell what is true or untrue.  Of course, out of the  3 original Supremes, Diana was my LEAST favorite, so it doesn't upset me to  read anything negative.  After all, we are all human, and anyone who can't  have ANYTHING written about them, cannot be human!  At any rate, I was not  too satisfied with the information I received from this book in terms of  completeness.	1999-09-29

The old saying goes, &quot;If you are going to get involved with a musician, be prepared&quot;.  It's not a normal life and no musician ever pretended it was.  They have greater temptations and problems than someone  with a 9 to 5 job.  Priscilla knew what she was getting into, before she  got into it, so I have no sympathy for her.  Understanding musicians is the  key to a happy life with them.  Apparently, she was too selfish to care  about anyone else but Priscilla and how SHE could benefit.  Elvis was no  saint, but who among us is?  I think Priscilla's bubble was burst when she  found out that Elvis was a real human being!  How childish can you get?	1999-09-27

Those who mentioned the errors in grammar better check their own spellings of words, while they're at it.

Despite the ups and downs the Beach Boys had, I  still love them.  My only complaint about this book is that at times, it  delved too much into the business affairs of the band, which bored me to  death.

I have sympathy for much of what she  went through, but parts of this book were greatly exaggerated, to portray  her as a &quot;victim&quot;.
