I wanted to read this book since a long long time and I happened to pick it up at a sale just about now, so I decided why not, since it was anyway a slim book.  <br /> <br />What I did not realise was the impact this slim book would likely have on me and wow i still cannot believe this book. The central theme of this book is how four young orphans are freed from the daily living and enter or rather create a world of their own where everything is bizarre and not quie there at all.  <br /> <br />Julie - being the oldest is quite bossy and soon experiencing the pangs of growing up, her sexuality and the newly found role of not only a surrogate parent but also the knowing of what is to be done and how.  <br /> <br />Jack - the aloof and almost demented teenager who is silent and yet so aware of what happens...I thought this character to be the strangest and yet somewhere down the line very sane. <br /> <br />Sue - the recluse who is shut all day reading and writing in her diary...and finally Tom - the baby or the youngets amongst the four who needs all the attention in the world... <br /> <br />This book is totally mindblowing and makes you think a lot. A lot than you can imagine...I have not given any spoiler..read it to believe it... <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-12-04

I was in a big, big, terrible book slump when I set my eyes on this gem-of-a-book titled, \\"The Kite Runner\\" by Khaled Hosseini. After hearing so much about this book from fellow book groupies, I had to read it. And then began a journey of extraordinary reading that lasted for 3 complete magical days. Emotions - deep, sometimes dark, sometimes bright and sometimes painful - that's all is what this book is about.  <br /> <br />Redemption is a constant feature that runs through the book and only makes us realize that no matter what - we are humans. So is it ok for us to err and divine for another human, in all not-so-human capacity to forgive? Or does it only mean that guilt is the only all-pervading emotion and nothing can be done to overcome it?  <br /> <br />All these questions haunted me while reading this book and also when I finished it. Let's get to the simple storyline of this book: <br /> <br />The Plot: Set in Kabul, Afghanistan - this story is about two friends - Twelve year old Amir - who is born to a high-caste family and Eleven-year old Hassan, whose father works as a servant for Amir's Father. Both are friends and are bonded together till one fateful winter day - Amir betrays Hassan and their lives are changed forever. This is Afghanistan of the 70s and the caste system looms heavy. The turn of the events lead to Russians invading Afghanistan that force Amir and his father to flee to America. Amir's betrayal arises from the fact that Hassan gets more attention from this father. If I say more - it would be killing the plot - so I will not... <br /> <br />The Kite Runner is one of those books that will haunt you for a long long time after you've finished it and will not let go. It tugs at your heart strings and makes you cry, makes you smile, evokes anger in you and it makes you feel things you never were capable of feeling.  <br /> <br />I think everyone who will read The Kite Runner will find a part of themselves in it. A part - long forgotten and yet itremains. Like a shadow, only waiting to see the light. A must must read!! Marvellous is an understatement for this jewel.	2004-11-23

And this time round its better than the first book in the famous Botswana private eye Mma Ramotswe and her No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series. Set in Botswana, Africa, Mr. Smith weaves a simple yet extraordinary tale of simplicity, love, roots and a dash of mystery.  <br /> <br />The essence of Africa is beautifully captured in a simple 227-page read that ends even before you've begun to savor Africa's aromas and tastes. After reading the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and Tears of the Giraffe, I've had the yearning to drink the bush tea that is spoken about constantly in the book. I might want to add that you must read its predecessor before tears of the giraffe - as both the books are interlinked and entwined as the river is to the sea.  <br /> <br />Something about the plot now: We are treated to various mystery cases in the course of this book. An American mother wants to know what happened to her teenage son in the Kalahari Desert and why did he disappear from the face of this planet. A butcher wants information on his wife and her on goings with another man. There are more tales that give this book its beauty of language and the craft of writing.  <br /> <br />Mr. Smith takes us on a roller-coaster ride through Africa - its people, their beliefs, the simple life they still lead mingled with technology and new-found ideologies. Africa - in the heart of the world is an unusual place - full of brightness and brotherhood.  <br /> <br />We are introduced to Mma Makutsi (Mma Ramotswe's secretary) in a new avatar of a junior detective and her first case.  We are further lead to Mr. Maketoni - the fianc of Mma Ramotswe and the problem of the orphaned children he has to take care of. Will Mma Ramotswe take the children in?

It opens your heart and sets you free. It teaches you how to live and love your life - to the fullest and for what it is - to be appreciated by people you love, to stand through their test of time and be there for them when they need you.  <br /> <br />Mr. Wallace has created a masterpiece. Simple, sweet and so true - when we chose to relate it to our day-to-day lives. The question is: what is Big Fish all about? Its about a man saving a town from a giant, its about a man who buys an entire town, a man who cannot be at one place for long - a man who wanted the world and got it - the man is Edward Bloom - the hero of this tale. A novel of mythical proportions as the cover suggests and leaves you baffled at the end of it.  <br /> <br />William Bloom - his son, narrates the story and taking us through Edward's life as Edward is counting his last hours on his deathbed. In the process, we are treated to Edward's life - from when he was born to where he is now.  <br /> <br />This book makes you laugh like you've never laughed and makes you cry like you've never cried. At the center of the book, despite all the tall-tales and myths we are exposed to, the readers are taken to the world of William and Edward Bloom - their relationship, the words every son and father want to tell each other and yet somewhere down the line they cannot. A mother, however, says all that she wants. A son confides everything in a mother. What happens between a father and his son is way too ambiguous - as though they don't know one another and perhaps never will. Or may be they are too much a part of another - that they overlook the similarity they share. They forget to celebrate those similarities.  <br /> <br />Dreams and Death form a major part of this book as does living...with wit and least pathos...life to the fullest!!  <br />	2004-10-03

I kicked off the month of September by picking up Sheldon's new \\"Are You Afraid Of The Dark?\\" and hated it...A quick read no doubt but BORING!! Almost to the verge of being predictable and driving you bananas... <br /> <br />Well the plot is nothing to talk about, but since it is a review i will speak about it: Four people die in various parts of the world and their deaths are all connected to one organisation. The widows of the two men who died - meet in all coincidence, following a love-hate relationship, to uncover the truth of their husbands' deaths. I repeat : BORING!!  <br /> <br />The fact of the matter remains : It is a fast read - took me like 4 hours to zip, zam and zoom.

I just finished a marvellous book titled, \\"Interpreter Of Maladies\\" by Jhumpa Lahiri and its truly a world-class book. It's a collection of Nine Stories - each speaking of Isolation, Loneliness, Love - sometimes unrequited, Desparation and Above all - the feeling of being home. It was no surprise that Ms. Lahiri won a Pulitzer Prize in the year 2000 for this book and she deserved it to the hilt! <br />Let's try and look at each story from a bird-eye's view without giving away too much:<br />I started the book with the Second Story \\"When Mr. Pirzada Came To Dine\\" - This story as I would like to derive revolves around Mr. Pirzada who comes to dine and know this Indian Family living in Boston and how he develops this special relationship with a little girl - thereby trying to overcome the pangs of missing his family back in Bangladesh that was partitioned in the year 1971. This story is set in 1971 and I cried after finishing it. Absolutely Beautiful. <br />My favorite tale in the entire book is \\"Sexy\\" - the fifth one where a Mid-Atlantic Woman falls in love with an Indian man - who is married and what she goes through resulting in a dramatic end - again, I love the way Ms. Lahiri tells a tale - It is as though she was living that woman's life, thereby making me live it as well. <br />The title story \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" is about Mr. Kapasi - a tourist guide who is also adept at translating maladies for a doctor in the remote part of India. It is through his job of being a guide that he interacts with Mr and Mrs Das and their children - leading to an astonishing discovery - and above all his innocent love falling apart...<br />\\"Mrs. Sen\\" talks about Mrs. Sen and how America seems and feels like an alien land and no matter how hard she tries she cannot make herself a part of the entire tapestry. And all this is said or transpired between her and the boy Eliot, who she babysits.Excellently written!!<br />I will only say this much...To know more about the other stories...Read this book!!	2004-03-26

Charlotte's Web - the first time I laid my eyes on this book was on an old dusty bookshelf in an old long forgotten lane of Bombay and I did not intend picking it up - till the book called out to me and demanded to be read. It demanded that I pick it up and I did. <br />Having said that, I have no regrets reading this one - though meant for kids and pre-teens who said a twenty-three year old cannot discover the child in him? Reading Charlotte's Web was discovering the child in me. The child I thought had long disappeared from my life...<br />What is Charlotte's Web all about? To put it plainly...its only about a Spider and a Pig. Or is it? There is more to it. It is about Wilbur - a pig who is saved by Fern - a little girl living on the farm in Pennsylvania - with her parents and brother. Till one fine day Wilbur has to be kept at her uncle's farm - due to the obvious reason - Space Constraints. Everything is going fine - till Wilbur realizes that he will soon become meat on the Christmas Table.<br />Enter: Charlotte : The friendly neighbourhood Spider - who cares for Wilbur like no one else has ever...A true friend and how she saves him from his death...<br />What I liked about this story: The way it was written - the simplicity that evolves throughout the book...and all that it asks us to be is humane - which is so difficult for humans...Eventually Fern also gives up on Wilbur - here E.B.

US	45808803	R20MBSNM9GYMDH	0452283868	921712930	Sula (Oprah's Book Club)	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Its a 10-Star book!!	Sula was a re-read for me and it was awesome! It was like tasting your favorite ice-cream sundae all over again. Letting the familiar flavors and fragrances wash all over you while the taste sinks on your taste buds and remains there forever. Sula is like that sundae with loads of nuts and various toppings of regret, friendship, love, betrayal and above all redemption. What made this book even more better was the fact that all the loose ends that were left untied the last time I read it, were complete and made all sense to me this time round. <br />\\"Sula\\" is a world in itself. A world defined by loss and womanhood. A world that is not restricted to Bottom - it could be anywhere and could occur at anytime. This book spans between 1921-1965 taking readers to a journey in the lives of two girls, Sula Peace and Nel Wright as they become friends, share secrets and make their way into womanhood. What I liked about the book was its simplicity - yeah it was simple as would not be generally expected out of Morrison's' works. <br />This 174 page so-called novella shows readers what it is that friendship can sometimes do and sometimes cannot. Sula Peace is one character that is so enigmatic and rich - she leaves her hometown called Bottom (which has a funny yet moving significance in the book) only to return and add to the anger of the residents. Sula is a woman of a different sort. Growing up in a poor black mid-western town, she lives in a home where men often visit, but don't stay very long. Her grandmother and mother allow men to satisfy their respective sexual desires, but don't need them in their lives on a permanent basis.<br />Out of this environment, and through other events in her youth (including ten years in the outside world attending college and living in different parts of the country), Sula arrives back at home as an attractive woman who, like her mother and grandmother before her, \\"uses\\" a different man every night to satisfy inner urges but nothing else. There is no love for Sula. She has exercised her freedom and independence by becoming the ultimate \\"player\\", loving and leaving them all over town, married or not. She even loves and leaves her best friend's husband, destroying both marriage and friendship.<br />And with nary a care. Until one day when an older man, Ajax, comes calling. He is kind but not possessive. They are a perfect match. They enjoy each other's company, and they certainly enjoy their time together in bed, but they don't need each other. They are two free spirits who can love and stay with each other precisely because their partner could care less. That is, until Sula starts to care. When she sets the table for two, cleans house, makes the bed, and \\"expects\\" Ajax to show, well, that's the end of that.<br /> love, love, love,<BR> makes you do foolish things.<BR> sit alone by the phone,<BR> a phone that never rings.<BR> hoping to hear you say<BR> that you love me still,<BR> knowing, knowing, you never will.<br />Some pretty nasty things happen to and around Sula on the way to her adulthood of free and open choice. In freely bedding any man she chooses, she becomes hated. She is the town pariah. A witch. Evil incarnate. In fact, the whole town measures their worth, their piety in direct contrast to Sula's evil. She is their yardstick. When she dies, when the yardstick goes away, they have no feedback loop, and fall into evil chaos themselves. Toni Morrison presents a clear view that evil makes us virtuous by comparison. In Sula, the entire town finds virtue by hating Sula.<BR>Sula, was, until Ajax, the only woman in the town who could resist the standard operating procedure, the moral code: \\"You need a man\\". To achieve that level of freedom in her time, she had to become, in many respects, the epitome of evil. Sula has to make some awful choices or sacrifices to be the person she chooses to be, to live her life as she pleases. The young Sula mutilates her own finger with a knife to prove herself a worthy opponent. \\"If I can do that to myself, what you suppose I'll do to you?\\"<br />Sula has many layers - I feel that the book was written with much integrity and a lot of afterthought. Toni Morrison observes the racial issues with such strength and vigor that the portrayal of which in the book is breathtaking. We also meet characters from her earlier books such as Tar Baby and the Deweys - which do have their significance in the book - only that it is lost after a certain point. The central link though is a drunk lost war fellow called Shadrack who comes across very strongly celebrating \\"Suicide Day\\". Toni Morrison uses Sula to help the reader analyze the conditions that have created Afro-American life in America. The picture is not always appealing, but there are some clear issues available for deep empathy and discussion.	2003-12-12
US	45808803	R1UP8RV1CD3X5G	140003065X	366389334	A Fine Balance	Books	5	4	5	N	N	AWESOME IS NOT THE WORD!! WOULD NEED A BETTER TERM!!	Rohinton Mistry manages to bring forth the horror and devastation wreaked by the Emergency in all its vividness through 'A Fine Balance'. The novel is both a commentary on the political and social environment of the time as well as a beautiful tragedy. <br />The story is based in 1975 in an unidentified city near the sea in India, riddled with poverty and teeming with beggars. Mistry places four pivotal characters in this squalid city. Mrs. Dina Dalal, 40-ish, poor and widowed after only three years of marriage. Determined to remain financially independent and to avoid a second marriage, she takes in a boarder and two Hindu tailors to sew dresses for an export company. Maneck is the son of an old school friend of Dina's who has been sent to college because the family business is failing; and the two tailors are Ishvar and his nephew Om, who have left their village in an effort to escape the repressive caste system. <br />The novel revolves around the interactions between these four characters. Their dreams and ambitions and the trials that they must face in life in order to achieve these. For four months, these four characters become a family. Eating and sleeping together, sharing their dreams, meals and living space. Their relationships with each other transcend inter-caste problems and barriers of caste, religion and monetary status. The cramped apartment becomes a haven from the political and social turmoil of the time. The four face various unpleasant encounters and are repeatedly saved from these by a quaint character, the Beggarmaster. The backdrop of the novel through all this is the Emergency period and the callousness of Indira Gandhi's government. <br />After lulling us into a false sense of contentment and security, we are reminded of the turmoil in the outside world by sudden tragedy which envelopes the lives of these four characters. On a visit back home, Om and Ishvar are forcibly sterilized; Maneck, devastated by the murder of an activist classmate, goes abroad. Dina who is unaware of all this is suddenly left all alone. She has no inkling of what has happened to the tailors and does not know why they do not come back from the village. Her immediate reaction is that once again she has been let down by people she has placed her trust in. Dina and the tailors carry on with their lives through all this because they have learnt &quot;to maintain a fine balance between hope and despair''.<br />Mistry manages to relate the cruelty faced by innocents and untouchables when a &quot;State of Internal Emergency&quot; is declared. The characters are used to represent people from all walks of life in India. The tailors are representative of villagers. Dina Dalal, is living in urban India. The young boy is representative of the youth of India. Through their experiences we realize the implications of a repressive caste system, an intrusive and hostile government and other adversities that must have existed in the India of the seventies. <br />Mistry also manages to maintain a fine balance of his own. He blends bad luck with a dash of hope, egging us on - only to dash our expectations with a new set of conflicts and troubles. There is always a silver lining for his characters. He creates a masterpiece that is Dickensian in its sympathy for the poor while combining it with a celebration of the indomitable spirit of human desire and hope as well as the despair of unfulfilled dreams. The novel is a symphony of corruption, cruelty, hope, desire, kindness and despair.	2003-12-08

Its not that I hated Costello, but then again somewhere down the line Coetzee's mastery did not come through as it did for Disgrace. <br />Elizabeth Costello is less of a novel more of a manifesto. A manifesto of relationships - seen through an aging writer's eyes-with her son, his wife, the members of her fraternity, with her sister (who she has lost touch and meets only once after eons), with the person she admired as a child, with her mother and with the Almighty (if I may say that). <br />Elizabeth Costello is about many day-to-day questions whose answers we look for in our lives and still are. The book does not provide you with answers, but it does make a great read somewhere down the line. Sublime, funny and sharp - Coetzee is a genius! My bone of contention: I know this one could have been ten thousand times better!!	2003-11-23

I picked up Stardust by Neil Gaiman on November 1st 2003 and I completed today - the 6th of November 2003 and it was an amazing read. Light and fluffy in places, but then again I loved it to the word GO!!<br />What is it about? It's about finding your Heart's Desire and this is exactly what Tristan Thorn sets out to do when his lady love Victoria Forester asks him to get the falling star they see together one night. They all live in a place called The Wall - and beyond it is what is known as the Faerie land - no one ever speaks about it and is forbidden to go there as well. And this is where the star fell...<br />What I loved about this book is the simplicity in which Mr.Gaiman has expressed his ideas and thoughts. There are times when you want to fling a book across the table and never open it for its sheer complex language - but this one is far beyond that reaction. Its about witches, fairies, about spells, about thrones and the fight for the same, its about destinies and above all - realizing that life isn't always what it seems to be...<br />It was a heart-warming experience for me reading this one. Thanks Gaiman.	2003-11-06

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the fifth book in the series, therefore is Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts, thus his age being 15. The Order of the Phoenix is a fattening (not to mention intimidating) 870 pages, and is over a hundred pages longer than the Goblet of Fire, which was long in its own right. The Order of the Phoenix starts out once again with Harry living at the Dursley's home on Privet Drive, though something very unordinary happens to Harry while he's heading home with Dudley one hot evening. Harry and his cousin are attacked by two Dementors (the guards of the Wizard Prison Azkaban), and after Harry uses magic to defend him and his cousin from them, a letter is sent almost instantaneously that Harry has been recommended for Expulsion from Hogwarts and is to attend a hearing later that month at the Ministry of Magic.<br />Harry isn't expelled, but life going back to Hogwarts wasn't going to be any easier than it has been ever since his first year. In the ending events of the Goblet of Fire (minor spoilers for those who haven't read the fourth book), Lord Voldemort has returned to a physical form, and so an old anti-Voldemort group that had been disbanded when he lost all his power to Harry Potter when he was a baby, called the Order of the Phoenix, and was founded by none other than Albus Dumbledore. The Order is comprised of many familiar characters from Harry's past years at Hogwarts, such as Madeye Moody, Remus Lupin, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius Black, a real surprise Severus Snape (as much as you may think he's evil, he's certainly not), and of course Albus Dumbledore - while a couple new characters like Kingsley and Tonks are introduced to the series, which look to be some promising characters in future books.<br />Going back to Hogwarts wasn't going to be as much fun as Harry was hoping it would be, though, because even though Harry had been face to face with Lord Voldemort not more than 2 months ago, the Minister of Magic's CorneliusFudge would NOT believe that \\"He-who-must-not-be-named\\", and so the Daily Prophet was reporting non-stop at how Harry is just looking for fame, basically saying that he was LYING about Voldemort's return. <br />The Order of the Phoenix is filled with all sorts of problems like Cornelius Fudge trying to take Albus Dumbledore out as Headmaster of Hogwarts, a continued search of Sirius Black even though he is innocent of the crime he was committed of (and served for), and a new witchlike lady sent in from the ministry as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Dolores Umbridge. Aside from Harry having weird dreams where he feels like he is actually there (which of course are used to build up the ending of the book), the Ministry of Magic is trying to take over Hogwarts and Professor Umbridge was appointed High Inquisitor, and overall makes Harry's life (along with teachers and other students) a living hell.<br />The Order of the Phoenix does a great job at building up for THE best ending in any of the Harry Potter books yet, and I was more baffled about certain things in this than I was the first four books at all, almost twice as much. While many questions in the Order of the Phoenix were answered in an explanatory matter, many more questions also rose from the book, and so that gives the sense that the sixth book will have a great deal of explaining to do on things. Basically, the Order of the Phoenix builds up around to what ends up to be the best ending than in any of the other four books, and while keeping from giving any spoilers, I must say that the action and sense of urgency was a very fulfilling feeling.<br />The Order of the Phoenix had a lot of directions that it could have gone in, since the first 3 books were leading up to what would be the resurrection of Lord Voldemort, though it took the definite route at a much more darker feel, and ultimately to the final battle of Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort. Who knows though? As far as anyone knows (except for Rowlings of course), the seventh book could leave off before Harry and Voldemort even have a final bout, though sensing at how bad the tension between Voldemort and Harry was in the Order of the Phoenix, I doubt the series will leave off without their final duel.<br />Thankfully, most of the characters from the past 4 Harry Potter books appear once again in the Order of the Phoenix at one time or another, while some new ones were also introduced. Dumbledore is of course back, as well as Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Fred, George, Sirius Black, Lupin, Mad Eye Moody, Lord Voldemort, Cornelius Fudge, and all the other Professors, while new characters to the series include Dolores Umbridge (you know that old hag of a teacher almost everyone has had one time or another in their lifetime?) and various members of Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters (his followers). <br />I HIGHLY recommend reading through the first 4 books before starting this one. While each book is a \\"story\\" in its own entity, there is still a very strong connection between all of the books to where you can't just pick up and read in the middle and expect to understand anything. The books nature is also MUCH more dark as the previous books, and at certain points kind of matures into more adult themes, but it was kind of evident that that was where the series was going to have to start going. After all, Lord Voldemort isn't some cheese ball, he's a for sure killer and will stop at nothing to get to Harry.	2003-09-01

US	45808803	R1DWRQPGOJK48Z	0808514121	974134151	East of Eden (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)	Books	5	10	13	N	N	I will give it a 10/10	After a long long time I got to read something so fulfilling. Something that one can identify with instantly and it does not take much effort as well. The theme of Brother Vs. Brother is universal and appealing to all. Maybe because as children of Cain, we are all the same - A blend of Good and Bad. Wow!!<BR>East of Eden was heavy for me!!<br />Steinbeck is so good at descriptions - love the style of writing, the dry subtle humor- the very fact that he does not justify his character's actions - the struggle of mankind, the inner conflict,is so beautifully portrayed.<br />The Theme: Brother vs. Brother <br />The Plot:  Two Families in Salinas, California. The Trasks and the Hamiltons. Adam Trask who faces a life-long complex from his brother Charles Trask heads towards a new life - with his brand-new wife. The birth of his twins is a joyous moment only to result in a sad one - with Kathy (his wife) walking out on<BR>him. <br />He raises the kids with his manservant Lee - the ever symbolical of what is right - Chinese - who is a great human character in ages to come. <br />The twins - Aron and Cal are poles apart and the rest is as they say \\"History\\".<br />The Hamiltons are a different breed altogether. Nine children and Samuel Hamilton is a man who never feels the need to have more money.<br />I guess the Biblical influence is immense in the book - but obvious it had to be!!<br />Overall, a great great awesome read!!	2003-08-04
US	45808803	R2OG1CBX49IGCJ	0446670111	573126810	Einstein's Dreams	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Never read anything like this Before!!	I have always gone back to this book. Read and reread it and this time I was rereading it for the fifth time or so. It was recommended to me a long time ago, when I was in college, by my mother's friend and I cannot thank her enough for this. Every time I read this book, I feel something new with great fondness for the writing and the book's plot. There are very few books one can go back to again and again and this for me is one of them. It is about time and human beings in it, whether we like to be in it or not, we are right there, at the core of time and its existence.<br /><br />\\"Einstein's Dreams\\" as the title suggests is about Einstein and his dreams pertaining to time. The book is written in the form of his dreams - all about time and the different aspects and the overall nature of time and the role it plays in our lives. Time is the hero of this collection of dreams. The different ways in which it can evade into people's lives and change the way they are, the way they see the world and the way they see themselves. The dreamer of these dreams: But of course Einstein. The book is about Einstein's Theory of Relativity, but the way Lightman does it is beyond superlative. It is about his ideas and dreams and how he shares them with his friend Besso. That bond is also very well done in the book. The dreams are almost like fables - magical, surreal, almost something that makes the reader want to live in those different time spans, experience all of it. I for sure felt that way every time I read the book.<br /><br />The beauty of the book is that there is just going on and on continuous chapters on time and the people around it in Berne, Switzerland, where Einstein worked as a clerk while working on the theory of relativity. Lightman's language is lyrical and beautiful to no end. Lightman does not spoon feed his readers and neither is he too vague about what he wants to say. It is as clear and yet as complex. It is not a book about science alone. It is a book if I can say, mixed, both with the right amount of science and the right amount of emotion which is much needed. To use the barest of plots and no specific technique, Alan Lightman has created a marvel of a book - the one which constantly takes you by surprise and is a jaw-dropper for sure. I highly recommend this book and hope that you are as fascinated by it as I was.<br /><br />Here is a little something from the book for you:<br /><br />\\"Consider a world in which cause and effect are erratic,\\" writes Lightman. \\"Scientists turn reckless and mutter like gamblers who cannot stop betting.... In this world, artists are joyous.\\" In another dream, time slows with altitude, causing rich folks to build stilt homes on mountaintops, seeking eternal youth and scorning the swiftly aging poor folk below. Forgetting eventually how they got there and why they subsist on \\"all but the most gossamer food,\\" the higher-ups at length \\"become thin like the air, bony, old before their time.\\"	2003-08-04

There is only one true human - the Snowman as the Crakers have learnt to call him or rather know him. He is the one - the narrator who recounts the tale of Oryx and Crake - of friendship, betrayal, love and above all the need to play GOD. <br />Genetic Engineering has always fascinated mankind and it is on this premise that Atwood's latest offering begins. Jimmy alias Snowman is one of a kind. The only human alive - with everything destroyed - living to tell the story of his life. <br />Set in a future called Compounds - where the new-age beings reside with comforts galore - Jimmy recounts the past - of his parents, of creatures known as Pigoons and Wolvogs (again genetically engineered), of his only friend Crake and the love of his life Oryx and how everything came to an astounding end. <br />Atwood has done it again. I loved the book from the word go though there were way too many pieces of prose hanging in-between and somehow the storyline was blurred in bits and pieces. However, Ms. Atwood has managed to create a world that leaves Handmaid's Tale far far behind. <br />Read it.... Its awesome.	2003-08-04

Here's another good one I lapped for the month of<BR>June...This one is a feast for the Stomach and the<BR>Soul. <br />The product of a cross-cultural family obsessed with<BR>food, Weston Tito begins his story by saying he was a<BR>seed in his parents' kitchensplural in both cases.<BR>Weston's mother is Italian and works the successful<BR>catering business BuenAppeTito upstairs; downstairs,<BR>his father, who is fixated on cooking only indigenous<BR>foods &quot;Santa Fe style&quot; (they live in Kansas City),<BR>runs the Tsil Cafe, a restaurant as it is<BR>tear-inducingly spicy. Wes' crib and later his cot are<BR>literally in his mother's kitchen (in the cabinets,<BR>for a while), and she teaches him her &quot;vocabulary,&quot;<BR>the names of foods, by letting him taste them. His<BR>father refuses him entry into his own obsessive<BR>domain, almost a holy order, until he can claim to<BR>enjoy such un-childlike flavors as habanero and<BR>anchovy. After that, like a knight's apprentice, he is<BR>allowed to help slice and chop ingredients -- carry<BR>his own sword, in effect. <br />One of the points of contention between Wes'<BR>hot-blooded parents is the local restaurant critic, an<BR>old admirer of his mother's. Nevertheless, the critic,<BR>who acts first as a teeter-totter between the two<BR>adults, ultimately becomes a sort of bridge, giving<BR>Wes his first opportunity to critique -- to see the<BR>food of both parents objectively -- and start to<BR>develop his own concept of food. <br />Over the years, Wes absorbs a rich stew of influences<BR>and emotions from his mixed-ethnic family, along with<BR>the various Mexican employees of the cafe who serve as<BR>surrogate relatives and even a Native American<BR>graduate student who takes him foraging for cactus and<BR>cattails and invites him to a corn dance. Ultimately,<BR>he will even marry the critic's female successor. <br />So pervasive is food in this coming-of-age novel that<BR>the recipes become a reflection oflife's shifting<BR>flavors in Averill's kitchen novel. The almost<br />magic-realism intensity of the flavor descriptions and<BR>the author's habit of dropping in dictionary<BR>definitions of various terms such as &quot;turkey,&quot;<BR>&quot;mescal&quot; and &quot;maple&quot; re-emphasizes the native quality<BR>of the ingredients. The narrator's entire life is<BR>lived in the study, anecdotal and later academic, of<BR>foods; ultimately he will become a chef as well,<BR>melding his parents' Old World and New World cuisines<BR>into a One-World cuisine. <br />A great fascinating read!!	2003-06-02

For a long long time now, I'd been wanting to read<BR>this new book by one of my Favorite writers and when I<BR>did I was beyond elation...<br />Haruki Murakami is a genius. He is the master of<BR>telling a story and is the best in his genre -<BR>whatever that may be. The six stories in this gem of a<BR>book revolve around people's lives before and after<BR>the Earthquake that shook Kobe in 1995. <br />The Psychological shock and collective grief are<BR>beautifully depicted through Murakami's words and<BR>prose. An electronic salesman rethinks and knows<BR>himself after his wife disappears one day - and he has<BR>to deliver a package. A Giant frog visits a Bank<BR>employee seeking help to save the World. A man builds<BR>bonfires to live and relive his life over and over<BR>again. Such stories and more are what make this book a<BR>true genius. <br />I may be biased towards Murakami but he is the best!!<BR>These stories in the true sense portray everything<BR>that humans have to offer. From love to loneliness to<BR>jeaulosy to tragic. <br />&quot;Honey Pie&quot; is probably my favorite piece of the<BR>collection. &quot;There's at least one good thing to tell<BR>about even the most ordinary bear,&quot; Junpei tells the<BR>little girl who is listening to his tale of the two<BR>bears. This fairy tale and the main story are<BR>interwoven in such a way that we become the little<BR>child listening to the narrator as we read. Of all the<BR>pieces, it is the one that, I think, most perfectly<BR>captures the delicate balance in the relationship<BR>between the self and the world. As the author writes,<BR>it is &quot;about people who dream and wait for the night<BR>to end, who long for the light so they can hold the<BR>ones they love.&quot; <br />A great great read!!	2003-06-02
US	45808803	RDKODMS2TAWP	0060002093	122576315	Ignorance: A Novel	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Hmmmm...Nice...	Kundera's newest novel, Ignorance, follows themes similar to several of his other novels, with the concentration of this one on nostalgia, on what people believe they should be feeling at a given moment even when they are not, and on how the decisions we make at the \\"Age of Ignorance\\" (or in our late teens/early twenties) affect our lives when we come to know and understand ourselves better later in life. Intermixed with these themes is the story of Odysseus' travels in the Odyssey and how it parallels the Great Return home of each of the characters.    The story is about two Czech émigrés who left during the Communist era and are now returning to Czech for the first time since the Communist regime ended in 1989. During Irena's return, she realizes how people have come to accept her as an émigré who left instead of staying loyal to her country. As she meets with her old Czech friends, she realizes the terms of their acceptance. They want to know nothing about her life outside the country. They want to amputate it, as she puts it, and by doing so, make her the same as them. Josef, on the other hand, returns to visit his family and revisits an old diary of his childhood. He marvels at the character he once was with distaste - how could he have been that creature, who seems so different from who he is now? These two émigrés end up meeting by chance to continue an old romance that neither of them accurately remembers.    One of the main themes of the book is the terms and conditions by which people accept another as one of their own. They look for similarities, memories they can both reminisce together, even if they both share a different perception of what actually occurred. After all, no two people share the same memories, which fade with time. Often people don't even remember themselves for who they were, and reading old writings, they ask themselves how this writer could have possibly been them at one point. People change, but others don't see them for who they are now. Only who they once knew, or as Kundera puts it \\"a reality no longer is what it was when it was it cannot be reconstructed.\\"    I always walk away from a Kundera book thinking a little differently about life, and while many of the ideas in this book have been written about in greater detail in his other books, I still enjoyed it as a quick read/refresher.	2003-05-12

If any of you are planning to start reading Ayn Rand for the first time I would suggest start with this one as it is the most simplest and basic of the theory of individualism. For that<BR>matter if there would be a quartet of Ayn Rand it would go in this order: Anthem, We the Living, The Fountainhead and then Atlas Shrugged. <br />Anthem is a tale - a sci-fi if you can call it that - set in futuristic era - the so called dark ages where the only word that exists is &quot;we&quot; and nothing more than that. Where people are not allowed to think for themselves...There is a collectiveness govt at play where everything is all rolled into one collective<BR>pronoun.

My thought<br />process was simple: what could be possibly so exciting<br />about stars' famed people's lives that I could not<br />incorporate in mine? I was so wrong. I just realized<br />it.<br />The biography of Jim Morrison was handed down to me by<br />my very close friend and one time my partner. He told<br />me &quot;You must absolutely read this one&quot; and I did. If<br />not for the dispassionate kisses that transpired<br />between us, I thank him profusely for introducing me<br />to the life of one of the legends of rock and roll.<br />Who was Jim Morrison? A freaked out personality, a bad<br />dream, a bad childhood, an insane creature of the<br />night or just a plain normal human being. Who was he<br />and why was he that way? After reading the book, I<br />tried answering these questions but gave up. Gave up<br />to let Mr.Morrison be. This book deals with hiss life<br />and more. His poetry. His life. For most part it does<br />deal with Jim Morrison the way he was : A person. The<br />very rare smiles, the even more rare sensitivity, the<br />ideals, the philosophies - everything that made the<br />man a person.<br />The madness existing is explained beautifully.

I do not know what he does to me but everytime<BR>I read what he writes - its like a tidal wave lashing<BR>over me and I cannot help it. I love the feeling. I<BR>cherish it for a long long time. South o the Border<BR>begins with a 37-year old narrator Hajimme - the owner<BR>of an upswanky jaz bar in Japan talking about his life<BR>- from where it began to where it is. <br />A Japanese love story; indeed, a Japanese Casablanca:<BR>it doesn't sound too promising, does it? But ignore<BR>the blurb - they've got to get people to pick it up<BR>after all - and dip a toe into the world of Haruki<BR>Murakami. This is, perhaps, the perfect place to start<BR>for newcomers - no wells; no sheep; no slightly<BR>off-kilter worlds, just a simple, if morally complex<BR>story exquisitely told. It's the prose stye (insert<BR>here a discourse on the art of translation, but the<BR>voice is Murakami) which will seduce you, not the<BR>narrator - he is morally ambivalent, and not in a good<BR>way. In the hands of such an accomplished writer,<BR>however, one is easily drawn in to Hajime's world.<br />Hajime would like to be a good man, but he has<BR>impulses; impulses which cause him to damage those he<BR>loves. The simple tale revolves around his childhood<BR>sweetheart finding him and endangering everything he's<BR>worked for. So far, so predictable; but the way in<BR>which Murakami teases out Hajime's character, and<BR>faces up to the moral dilemmas without judging his<BR>motives - they are simply laid out for us to observe -<BR>produces a true feeling of uncertainty in the reader,<BR>and compels you through the story wishing that both<BR>outcomes were possible. A cunningly crafted tale,<BR>carried off with thoughtful aplomb, and the ideal<BR>jumping-off point for further exploration of this most<BR>intriguing of authors.	2003-02-02

Bought this book at a whim and did not wish to read it for a long long time, till I picked it up and then could not stop until I had reached the very last page. <br />Sijie's first novel or rather novella (considering it is only something like 184 pages long) begins with the Chinese Revolution headed by General Mao and the concept of &quot;re-education&quot; - as a result of which two teenagers are transported to an ancient village away from civilization. <br />No one being re-educated is permitted to read any books excepting the little book of sayings written by Chairman Mao. It is when, through a series of events, they obtain a book written by Balzac (the reading of which is now a crime) that suddenly the world of literature and of ideas abruptly opens to them. They are so hungry for more that all they can do is dream (and scheme) about getting other such books. They later meet the third primary character in this book, the very beautiful young seamstress, and, by relating to her the words of Balzac, produce in her too the desire for more such words and thoughts. She is as hungry for new stories and ideas as are the two boys. <br />Luo, now in love with the girl, wants to obtain more books for her, not only to please her but also to raise her up from her lack of education to become something other than the peasant girl she is (albeit a beautiful one). In that desire to &quot;re-educate&quot; the girl he loves resides their ultimate future. <br />This is a wonderful story about relationships and love, about the buoyancy of youthful souls thrown into the cold and potentially drowning waters of very trying circumstances, and, lastly, about the need for those things in our lives that stir our imaginations to life and so generate fresh desires and new dreams within us. It is the stirring of human imagination that ultimately changes the world.	2002-12-03

As the title perhaps suggests, Murakami's new novel tells in alternating chapters two stories that soon begin to speak to one another as the reader notices details of the one appearing transmogrified in the other - except that &quot;transmogrified&quot; isn't the right word because both stories are so bizarre. The first concerns an agent or &quot;calcutec&quot; for &quot;the System&quot; (ostensibly the good guys, part private corporation, part government agency) whose brain has been altered to allow him to &quot;shuffle&quot; and &quot;launder&quot; data to keep it out of the hands of the nefarious &quot;Semiotecs&quot; - a sort of mafia intent on stealing sensitive high-tech information. The problem for Murakami's nameless calcutec is that his engineered subconscious - the black box in which his shuffling takes place - is short-circuiting (Murakami's sci-fi or cyberpunk account of this is quite elaborate), and when &quot;meltdown&quot; is complete, his world, his conscious self, will disappear, leaving him trapped deep within his own subconscious. It is here, at &quot;the end of the world,&quot; that the second story occurs, a world of the narrator's own unconscious creation that takes the form of a walled town from which there is apparently no escape and in which unicorns siphon off the minds of inhabitants shorn of their shadows, both of which alterations leave them immortal but without emotion. In this apparent utopia, the narrator spends his time dreamreading -a lightning-rod or grounding activity performed by tracing the bits of mind stored in unicorn skulls as they are released by his touch in the ring of light rays - and contemplating, among many other things, the possibility and desirability of escape.<br />As the narrator remarks upon being told his fate, &quot;The Wizard of Oz had to be more plausible,&quot; yet plausibility is not this author's concern. Murakami, whose sensibility seems distinctly Western and whose works are awash in allusions to Western culture high and low, is an effortless postmodernist who in a recent Publishers Weekly interview cites Kurt Vonnegut and Richard Brautigan as important influences (&quot;The End of the World&quot; chapters recall nothing so much as Brautigan's In Watermelon Sugar, with traces of A.E. Van Yogt's &quot;The Enchanted Village,&quot; just as the parallel story recalls variously everything from Gravity's Rainbow to Get Smart). Likewise, Murakami revels simultaneously in sheer plot fabrication and technical experiment, on the one hand, and ideas, on the other. Like Vonnegut and Brautigan, Murakami's technical experiments succeed so unobtrusively that they are in danger of being missed, and his prose is similarly so readable, so seemingly simple and playfully colloquial (thanks here to Alfred Birnbaum), that it can easily be misread as flat and emotionless (witness Paul West's review in the New York Times Book Review). Yet as Murakami has explained in the above-mentioned interview, &quot;Most Japanese novelists are addicted to the beauty of the language. I'd like to change that ... Language is a kind of tool, an instrument to communicate.&quot;<br />And what does Murakami communicate? Among other things, a moving, emotionally understated meditation on mind and identity, on science and humanity, on dreams of utopia and the comforting familiarity and various satisfactions of our messy, flat, uncommon lives. Don't let Murakami's popularity or the current type put you off: do yourself a favor and read Hard-Boiled Wonderland; you won't be disappointed.	2002-09-20

I always believe that if you want to know an author's true works - then first discover stories written by the author. And this belief has carried me through the road of discovering some really good authors one of them being Ali Smith. <br />Cutting the hype of \\"Hotel World\\", \\"Free Love and other stories\\" - i think which was the first book of Ali Smith is a winner all the way. Abstraction is the highlight of the stories presented in this collection and they are all so thought provoking. <br />\\"Text for the Day\\" is one of my favourites - which tells about a woman named Melissa and her undying love for books and the printed word. Then there is \\"Free Love\\" - tracing the sexual awakening of a young girl on a trip to Amsterdam. \\"To the Cinema\\" - as the title suggests is all about love for the movies juxtaposing the dreariness of living. <br />This is not the end of it thankfully....there are more gems to chose from - there's \\"The Unthinkable happens to people everyday\\" about a famous tv host trying to rediscover life and its simple pleasures then journeying to \\"The World with Love\\" - which is rich in its prose. <br />What I loved about this collection was that the stories are not the usual run-of-the-mill short stories - they are here to stay and say something fascinating. They are worth a read all the time and a thousand times more!!	2002-09-20

I just finished one of the most amazing books I've<br />read this year. The Hero's Walk is undoubtedly one of<br />the finest books ever written in English by an Indian.<br />What makes this book so different and refreshing apart<br />from the plot is the treatment of the books and its<br />characters. The plot revolves around Sripathi Rao - a<br />simple man with simple needs in the town of Totapuram<br />nestled in the South of India - and in the Big House<br />we meet his wife Nirmala - the ever docile Indian Wife<br />- his horrendous mother Ammaya who in most respects<br />can be labelled a witch - his unmarried sister Putti -<br />who longs for the boy next door, and his son Arun - a<br />rebellion in the true sense of the word.<br />Amidst all this lies the past - of his daughter Maya<br />getting married to a foreigner and residing in<br />Vancouver - who has never seen her family for seven<br />years now. Her father has abolished her very name<br />being taken in the house - till she and her husband<br />Alan meet with an accident and Sripathi has to go to<br />Canada to claim his granddaughter Nandana.<br />With her parents no more, Nandana is lost and confused<br />in India and is trying to connect stuff to her past -<br />which is quite a task for a seven-year old.<br />The story revolves around the fact that simplicity is<br />the biggest act of heroism. Badami's style of writing<br />is dry, subtle and so so heartbreaking that it almost<br />had me on the verge of tears.<br />Though the authhor does remind you of R.K. Narayan at<br />various points in the book, she does have the finesse<br />to take you by surprise. A great read!	2002-07-27

The simple reason being : It is not shown in India where I hail from. I happened to pick this book by chance while browsing through my favorite local bookstore and I am glad I did pick this one!<br />What I like a lot about this book is that its not laced with any sweetness or sacchrine. It is as it is. True. Painful and yes bitter in most places. The characters are strong and yet so weak like all humans. The fact that it was nonfiction made me relate more clearly to the book and I was not biased while devouring it whole heartedly. <br />Candace Bushnell draws from what she has witnessed or sometimes may be overheard. The setting could not have been more perfect: Manhattan in all its glory and languish is but a cold city without any warmth. Sex as most of the book is centred around funnily enough is not of great significance in the book according to me. There are way too many other paramters like loneliness, unrequited love, survival and friendship on which the book truly stands. <br />A lot of negativity that this book generated was also one of the reasons why it became so famous and popular. But if someone would ask me what I found most amazing in this book: This book had the soul of a lost city. Of a city that could only cause grief!<br />Nevertheless, a great read on a rainy afternoon!	2002-07-18

I read this book for the first time when I was 15 and well - a teeny bopper would be taken away by this book and I was. I have read it over and over again and cried like crazy - laughed like a maniac and gone hysterical reading this love tale. <br />It's not the language of the book - but its simplicity that I believe has earned it so many fans throughout the world. After all love does speak the universal language - of warmth, of caring, of being in the moment in the arms of the beloved till its gone and all remains is memories - moondust...<br />Its one book I keep close to my bed.

I had read &quot;Written on the Body&quot; before by Ms. Winterson, but this one changed the way I looked at love. It taught me so much more. Made me a mature person at the end of 13 readings and I wish it would go on and on...<br />Henri and Villanelle are two different people dreaming of two different destinies..Love is non-existing and yet it is somewhere there buried deep in the waters of magical Venice where most part of the story is set. Henri loves Bonaparte and Villanelle - she has her heart given to a mysterious lady. This is not the only place in the book where love and its complexities play havoc..There are more focal points but what I liked immensely about this book was the simplicity with which it was written...<br />The reason why I cried because I know unrequited love and this book speaks of it - its language is that of lost love, of a love so distant and cold that its impossible to touch it, ,to feel it, to provide warmth in the cold, lonely nights. <br />There is a sentence in the book which I love a lot..actually there are two: &quot;Could a woman love a woman for more than a night?&quot; and &quot;There is no love when you get up next to a person by chance&quot;...Sentences like these and many more make this book one delicious course..Read it and be dazzled!!	2002-06-30

I just finished one of the most amazing book of the century gone by. I do not know why people always associate Anais Nin and her works to Erotica when there is so much more to it. Yes she did write a whole lotta sensous reading material but then again she was only portraying the truth, wasn't she? <br />A Spy in the House of Love is all about a woman named Sabina and her life as she flows or rather drifts from one lustful experience to another. She lies, she deceives, she puts on an act only never to find solace in places where she looks for the most - in the arms of strangers but her own husband Alan. <br />My feelings ranged like tidal waves while devouring this book. I felt like a thief hiding a secret and at the same time felt so connected with my emotions and responses to what my body demanded. <br />Sabina as a character is so quite that sometimes her silence speaks volumes. The way she moves, the way Ms. Nin breathes life into her is absolutely a piece of art. Rising from the ashes and yet unforgiven. A true to life caricature of what desires can do and their power on our mortal lives.	2002-06-06

Margaret Mitchell called Savannah, Georgia \\"that gently mannered city by the sea\\" and indeed, with Spanish moss hanging from the huge oak trees and the pale shine of the moon reflecting off the pillars of Savannah's stately mansions, the imagination can conjure up an idyllic setting where the clop of hooves on the cobblestone streets echo in one's mind and sweat from the glass of a tasty mint julep leaves a ring on the tabletop.<br />\\"You mustn't be taken in by the moonlight and magnolias.  There's more to Savannah than that.  Things can get very murky,\\" says Jim Williams.<br />If anyone would know, it's Williams.  He stands at the center of John Berendt's hugely entertaining account of a city, a murder trial, and the social machinations --- high and low --- that mesh on the fringes of the politely hushed and multi-layered Savannah society.<br />An antiques dealer whose parties became the talk of all Savannah, Williams one day finds himself in a lot of trouble...he's charged with the murder of a young gigolo, Danny Hansford.  A part-time employee and house guest of Williams, Hansford had a reputation for his violent temper and his sexual proclivity to service both men and women.  Williams claims self-defense and a trial ensues.<br />Through a complicated mix of legal maneuvers, Williams is tried four separate times for Hansford's murder, the only man to have achieved that distinction in the Georgia criminal justice system.<br />As compelling as the murder story and the resulting trial are to Berendt's tale, it's the magnificent portrayal of the history of Savannah and the cast of quirky characters that people the city that make MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL so successful.<br />Besides Williams, we meet Joe Odom, a former lawyer, tour-guide, and piano player, whose charm and talent are only outweighed by his audacious behavior.<br />Luther Driggers keeps the city on edge.  An inventor who failed to get rich after discovering the pesticide and process that led to the flea collar, he now walks the streets with a bevy of flies attached to his person by threads, carrying a vial of poison that he threatens to dump in Savannah's water supply.<br />Lady Chablis, a drag queen and performer who takes a shine to Berendt, provides some of the more hilarious moments in the book.  And then there's Minerva, a voodoo high-priestess whom Williams hires to ease his guilt by calming the ghost of the murdered Danny Hansford and to bring what luck she can to his side during his legal troubles.<br />Yes, this is a book about a murder, but it's so much more.  We can thank Berendt for taking the scenic route through Savannah in the telling.  The historical facts, the anecdotes about the rich and eccentric citizens of the city, and the compelling story of the forces --- both dark and light --- that come together in MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL add up to one wickedly funny, wholly evocative romp of a read.that led to the flea collar, he now walks the streets with a bevy of flies attached to his person by threads, carrying a vial of poison that he threatens to dump in Savannah's water supply. <br />Lady Chablis, a drag queen and performer who takes a shine to Berendt, provides some of the more hilarious moments in the book.

What I liked about the book<BR>was its simplicity - yeah it was simple as would not<BR>be generally expected out of Morrisons' works. <br />This 174 page so-called novella shows readers what it<BR>is that friendship can sometimes do and sometimes<BR>cannot. Sula Peace is one character that is so<BR>enigmatic and rich - she leaves her hometown called<BR>Bottom ( which has a funny yet moving significance in<BR>the book ) only to return and add to the anger of the<BR>residents. <br />Sula has many layers - I feel that the book was<BR>written with much integrity and a lot of afterthought.<BR>Toni Morrison observes the racial issues with such<BR>strength and vigor that the portrayal of which in the<BR>book is breathtaking. We also meet characters from her<BR>earlier books such as Tar Baby and the Deweys - which<BR>do have their significance in the book - only that it<BR>is lost after a certain point. The central link though<BR>is a drunk lost war fellow called Shadrack who comes<BR>across very strongly celebrating \\"Suicide Day\\". <br />I will not say more. The idea is to go pick this book<BR>and believe you me - its not going to be<BR>disappointing!	2002-05-27

The Night Listener, recommended strongly to me by my friends Dena and Soky is a masterpiece. Maupin's a literary genius. Though for a long time now, I had \\"Tales of the City\\" lying on my TBR, I never picked it up. I'm glad I started Maupin with The Night Listener. A semi-autobiographical novel written with so much emotion and love, its unbelievable. I have drowned myself in tears of joy and sadness. <br />The Night Listener is a different book. And when I say that, I mean it 110%. The protagonist Gabriel Noone is a gay storyteller. He has written many novels based in San Francisco and serialised by him on AIR. His long-time partner Jess has drifted away as he has got AIDS. And one fine day he gets hold of a manuscript written by a thirteen year-old Pete Lomax who is tested positive for AIDS and tells a long dak history of child abuse. Pete and Gabriel start conversing over the telephone. Pete is an ardent fan of Gabriel's works and radio shows. Through Pete, Gabriel learns to face his own demons and where he stands in the scheme of things. He learns to live and finally love. <br />That's not it. There are so many surprise elements. You must read the book to find that out. The Night Listener healed me... Rarely comes a book that can manage to touch you so deep. Night Listener is one of them. The book is an event in my life.

I finished \\"She's Come Undone\\" with a whole lot of tears surging in between laughs and girlish giggles. And while I was doing this, I let go so much of my emotional baggage. It's aamazing how a book like this can make you do that. <br />Dolores Price is more than a book character to me. It's like I see her everyday in a child who's marriage is on the rocks,  in the whales when I watch National Geographic, in the Grandmother who cannot express her feelings, in the man who rapes kids, in the face of almost every stranger I meet - I can see Dolores and what she stands for. <br />She's Come Undone is more than a growing up saga. It's about dealing with one's emotions deep within and the range of risks one is willing to take from there. A journey clouded by many fears - all deep buried in a little girl's heart called Dolores -with the television and Chucky Cheese as soul companions. And on the other hand the strength Dolores derives from the weak men in her life - right from her father to the man she thought she loved. <br />Wally Lamb writes with a smoothness and connection so rare these days in authors. He has the skill of making things so funny and yet so heartbreaking. He gives us the real thing, without frills. One can relate to what Dolores goes through as easily as one could relate to say, To Kill A Mockingbird. <br />A sensitive issue with most of us is being Overweight which is dealt with in such a sensitive manner in this book. Its like Dolores finally cuts all strings attached to her once she reduces and decides to come undone...<br />...Reading this book was no rollercoaster experience. It was so real that I loved it. This book made me see what we all are made of - probably a little bit of loneliness, some pain, some hurt, redemption, some love and most of all - Self Respect! A true masterpiece.	2002-02-25

After reading Girl in Hyacinth Blue, Tulip Fever was the icing on the cake of historical fiction and art as the theme. <br />The Players:<br />Cornelius: The wealthy old merchant in Amsterdam. <BR>Sophia: His young wife wanting more than wealt and riches. <BR>Jan: The young painter hired by Cornelius to paint the couple and immortalize them. <BR>Maria: The maid of the family with secrets' of her own.

As sinful as ever. <br />So these are the characters and the story takes place in 17th century Amsterdam, where tulips are a madness, where love is sometimes adulterous, where there is a yearning for a child, where there is betrayal, crimes of passion, blackmail, gamble, dreams, and no conscience. <br />This book kept me awake as I flipped the pages that revealed the genius of Ms. Moggach. With every chapter and every character introduced, Ms Moggach provides the readers with a tapestry so magnificient and amazing - that sometimes the locale just fades into background. <br />The tulips hog the limelight for most part of the tale with the players and the description is beautiful. Before you know it, you wish that this story would not end. A must read for all those who like literary page turners!	2002-02-23

But I know I will never read a book like &quot;What We Keep&quot; by Elizabeth Berg this year. I picked this book up on the 7th of February and finished it on the 13th. This book has been with me for a week and will remain for a long time in my memory. The book is about mothers and daughters. I know it's cliched. Many things have been written on this topic but this book is different. It bares its soul to the readers. <br />The narrator Ginny Young at forty-seven is out to meet her mother after thirty-five years on a call from her sister Sharla. While travelling on the air plane she narrates the past. The little incidents. The midnight escapades with Sharla and all the complexities of an eleven-year old and her older sister. While reading this book, there were many a times that I cried uncontrollably and now when I ask myself  why: I know that the book made me contemplate the relationship I share with my mother and all those times we have been close and in many ways apart. <br />I cannot resist but include these beautiful lines from the book as excerpts:<br />&quot;I suppose what I now believe is that we owe our mothers and our daughters the truth, and the truth is that my mother was forgiven in the way she was not forgotten.&quot;<br />What we Keep made me think of really what we do keep - memories, anger, frustration, childhood, sisterhood, joy, sadness and more than anything else no matter what the ties with a mother - the ability to forgive and forget, the ability to love again no matter what. <br />I would recommend this book to anyone. Everyone must read it.	2002-02-13

From a father's misgivings to Vermeer's Daughter's Passions and so much more defines this 242 page, according to me masterpiece. <br />It could have been any painter, any artist - because Ms. Vreeland's style is so unique and new that she could have given  words to any painting. Any picture that speaks a thousand words, that touches the lives of so many, is sometimes so isolated and unappreciated. The girl in the picture, as the story progresses represents beautiful things for different people. It portrays poignancy heightened by the mysteries of giving and losing. Only in the end to seek the truth- beauty for what it really is!	2002-02-09
US	45808803	R1KCPWS83UYIHV	1860462588	22806037	Silk	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Poetic and Beautiful!	Love beyond measure. Unrequited love beyond measure too? Is this what life is all about? Such were my thoughts after I finished reading &quot;Silk&quot;. Smooth and sheen as the fabric, this book touched me on different levels. Apart from taking me to diferent places, this book transported me to being aware of my feelings and emotions. <br />There are few books that manage to touch your heartstrings and this was one of them for me. It was not in as much as Joncour's journey and him meeting Hara Kei's concubine that touched me, it was more the wife back home ,Helene, and her perspective that  enthralled me. The love she had for her husband. The passion that she could never receive. Also then the meandering thought: Can boundaries separate love? Can borders and distances actually make you forget someone? And the answer was a resounding No! <br />Baricco's prose avoids conveying a sense of unadulterated realism as it forays in and out of the open-ended dimension of surreal sensuality and romanticism. Joncour too, is caught in this inescapable web, as he finds himself becoming obsessed with the girl who utters nary a word to him throughout the entire story. Like a true romantic, Joncour believes that language is superfluous when it comes to expressing emotions as he philosophizes, &quot;sometimes life shows you a side of itself which leaves you with nothing more to say.&quot; <br />Silk is a literary microcosm of how the West has understood the Orient in all of its exotic majesty and mystery. By stepping back from the enchanting image of Baricco's unfathomable girl, we are better able to see for ourselves that the Orient as a whole escapes precise definition. And rightly so. For once a culture, possessed of the traits and complexities that are unique to itself, is portrayed with certitude by another, it is divested of its birthright to exist on its own terms and of its capacity to externalize the wonderful diversity of the collective human experience.	2002-02-06

No mystery writer living or dead can surpass Dame Agatha Chrstie's skill, eye-for-detail and magnanamous scope and appetitie for mystery. She weaves a juicy thriller like no other. Simple people get involved as in this book - where there is no Poirot, no Marple, no Tommy and Tuppence - just a bunch of people gathered at Salt Creek and then a murder occurs - in fact two...This is where the action starts or rather as the book says: Towards Zero is just the time of the murder. The murder has been planned way in advance. As usual, the plot moves at a rapid pace with lots of twists and turns and suggestive clues dropped here and there. Whodunit!! No one knows till the end! <br />Towards Zero is a great mystery to be cherished on a rainy afternoon with a cup of hot chocolate...Dame Christie does it again for me!!	2002-02-04

This was the first time I was venturing to read a Banville and thank god, I did decide to pick it up. A short novella - around 97 pages and riveting!<br />This book is a letter written by the narrator - who is nameless and has entered the Irish countryside to finish his book on Newton only to discover and re-discover his own denied passions and emotions. His cottage is situated in a place called Fern house where he encounters a strange lot of people - Edward, Charlotte, Edward's Sister Diana and her husband Tom, Ottilie - Charlotte's so-called niece and little Michael. As the narrator gets engrossed in their lives, he loses focus of the book, only to drown it. This is a classic juxtaposition of how Newton one fine day gave up on science and took to alchemy. <br />This book is one of a kind and when I say this, I really mean it. Banville conjures a mystery, a love story, a discovery sometimes and beauty of language so rare these days in most novels - and where else can one find such a combination and being told in 97 pages!! Wow!!	2002-01-29

I read it in 2001 and while reading this book, scenes played in my head for a long long time. This book is one of its kind - Evocative and Original, it speaks of so much on so many different platforms. It exudes charm, young love, yearning, innocence lost, and most of all what it takes to forgive someone. What change means for everyone in the story - From Charlotte who is raped and refuses to speak from there, for her brother who is fighting his own demons, for the man who runs the in-famous \\"House of Gentlemen\\" where men gather to get rid of excess baggage and guilt, where women come to find a tender touch and words no one shall speak to them, where a girl is trying too hard, her brother - a sex maniac and a soldier who wants to runaway.<br />This is a story of lives forgotten and sometimes shrouded in so much pain and anguish that one needs cructhes to fall back on to overcome problems. One needs an addiction like love. Like the warmth and honesty of a man which only a house can provide. A house with its own ghosts - a child, a boy, a girl and a father...Read this one!!	2002-01-24

This was the first time I was reading Ian McEwan and loved it, only because of the simple reason: He writes real well. The story centers around two so-called-lovers , Colin and Mary are vacationing in Venice ( We assume that the place is Venice as it is never once mentioned in the book, but the descriptions are good enough to reach that conclusion: Wonder why McEwan did not add the name of the place?)and suddenly bump into a couple - a rather strange couple - Robert and Caroline who seem to be quite odd and it is maybe this weirdness that attracts them to the couple. After this, I won't give away more..All I can say is that this 134 page book was an amazing read for me!! Truly enigmatic!!	2002-01-21

When I picked up this book, I knew nothing about The Book of Tobit and how did Parsis live and what were their origins or anything about them. I just had a couple of Parsi friends and yet I never bothered to ask them about their heritage, till I read Miss Garnet's Angel. <br />I do not know under which genre would this book fall in, but I do know that this book has a class of its own. The characterisation of Julia Garnet - reminds me of so many Muriel Spark characters - Miss Garnet was my companion while I was reading this book. The setting of course was amazing - venice! hmmm...the narrow bylanes in the water, shadows of Miss Garnet and her life, the friends she makes in Venice, the heart ache, the revelation, the search - all of this and more make the book so magnanamous - so rich in detailing - that one wants to stop at many places in the book and ask themselves: What would I do if I was in her place?<br />It's not only Harriet's Death that prompts and evokes feelings in Miss Garnet's heart. It runs deeper than that. There is more to be discovered - Go read this one!!	2002-01-19

I started reading this book a long time ago but then for reasons only known to time, I stopped in-between. I'm so glad I picked it up again and read it cover to cover as of now. <br />This book holds a lot of meanings in it for me. While on one hand there was the free-spirited, individualistic passion of Ingrid, there is also the underlined yearning for a family of Astrid. While there is the seeker, there is the leader as well. While there is passion, there is sadness. And so much more screams from this book. <br />Ingrid's madness and strive to be what she is over clouds Astrid's need to be and believe in what she wants to. Sometimes a mother-daughter relationship needs more than higher ground to survive on. It needs a bitter-sweet understanding of what transpires between a mother and daughter..when a daughter grows into a woman and needs her mother the most - when at times the mother is not around, seeking solace in things unknown and life just springs it self on you...<br />When Astrid needs her mother so desparately till there comes a stage when it becomes so difficult for her to accept her mother, the way she is.

I happened to read The Bell Jar for my book group discussion for the month of December and instantly fell in love with the book. More than anything else I think it was Esther and her descriptions that absolutely gripped me from the very first word. <br />While reading the book, many times I tried to question my own sanity and what I was going through and quite surprisingly this book I felt dealt with so many issues that we all go through some or the other time in our lives. Esther's struggle with issues and people around her gave me an inkling into what was I facing with people around me. It's not more of madness than being sane that made me love this book and what it stands for - probably suffocation, probably the need to get away so many times when we are unable to do so. The probability of meeting someone nice and sensitive which never really works that way. <br />Grappling with oneself and situations can be quite a thing to undertake. Most of the times, many of us choose to push things under the rug without paying attention to our thoughts and problems. Esther on the other hand chooses to look inside and find answers which probably is best summed up in the following lines from the book, <br />&quot;How did I know that someday--at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere--the bell jar, with it's stifling distortions, wouldn't descend again?&quot;<br />This quote becomes all the more poignant when one discovers that only a month after The Bell Jar, her first novel, was published, Sylvia Plath took her own life. One wonders if things would have been different had she lived today. All in all The Bell Jar is one of the books in my life, which I will never let go...	2002-01-07
US	45808803	R187ZQXKB002AJ	0679750533	347053634	The Elephant Vanishes: Stories	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	Me and Murakami	One of my favourite Japanese writers. There is no one else who can write about loneliness the way he does. Murakami's collection of stories is simply superb! I was struggling to find a good blip from this book, one that will give a proper sense of Murakami's style and material. It's a problem, because when I pick something out of context, it sounds plain and ordinary. If I pick something from his dream-like sequences it sounds kitschy. This would be messing with the impact of his stories, which aren't even close to being simple or over-cute... Profound is a better description fo Murakami's work, and mystic in an urban, understated kind of way. The Washington Post Book Review says (on the book cover) that Murakami &quot;takes big risks.&quot; and one can see why they might say that. My strong impression is that fully half of his stories are drawn from his dreams, and you know how wonky dreams can get. His work often takes a sudden shift, or it stops, without full resolution. But it's okay, dangling bits can add to the richness of a good story. The story titles are quite illustrative:<br />-The Wind-Up Bird and Tuesday's Women -Sleep -The Fall of The Roman Empire, The 1881 Indian Uprising, Hitler's Invasion of Poland, and The Realm of Raging Winds -The Little Green Monster -TV People -The Dancing Dwarf<br />Aside from these dream-like stories he's got more matter-of-fact ones (see more titles below). One of Marukami's strengths is that he can write a story almost as one tells one in conversation, starting with the bit that made you think of it in the first place, mentioning 'real life' asides and in the process including the reader in a subtle and complex experience.	2002-01-07

One of my favourite non-fiction reads. A terse and disturbing account of the author's life in the South where she is abused by her step father and eventually goes on to derive her strength from herself and knowing who she really is and what she stands for. <br />What I liked about this autobiography - if you can call it that is the plain candidcy that shines through the book. Ms Allison clearly states that her being a lesbian has nothing to do with the abuse she faced and its true. It's ridiculous how one tends to believe that one's sexuality preference is a result of something and not out of choice. <br />While reading this so-called non-fictional novella, I came to realise what it was like for me when i came out of the closet. I related to the book on so many levels because being gay in a country like India is so difficult - the atrocious remarks, the unwelcoming feeling in the family and apart from all this Dorothy Allison's book always comforted me in a weird way and I loved that comfort food!	2002-01-07

Coming from the Caribbean, though, has made it virtually impossible for Marquez to depart from reality, even with liberal use of his imagination. Marquez claims, \\" . . . nothing has ever occurred to me, nor have I been able to do anything, that is more awesome than reality itself. The most I've been able to do has been to alter that reality.\\" This seems an awesome claim after reading Chronicle of a Death Foretold, in which some episodes seem completely impossible. That impossible reality, however, is what, according to Marquez, gives Latin American writers the ability to create fantastic stories. The ambiguous Latin American setting of Chronicle of a Death Foretold is what gives Marquez the opportunity to use his imagination to create an altered version of his own magical reality.<br />The events that transpire in Chronicle of a Death Foretold hinge on the setting. Marquez is purposefully not very specific about the location or identity of the small Latin American town in which Santiago Nasar dies. He reveals that the population is small, which is very important to the plot progression. Marquez would not have been able to create the same story in the middle of a bustling city full of strangers; he needed a small intimate setting that would allow him to twist reality within reasonable bounds. One of the elements of the plot that best exhibits magical realism is the fact that everyone in the town knows Nasar is going to die without Nasar finding out until the last minute. It seems impossible for everyone to know someone is going to die without the future victim having any knowledge of his fate. Marquez has &quot;alter[ed] reality,\\" but made his alterations more plausible by his choice of setting. <br />First, Marquez presents the town as being very small and intimate. Consisting of many large and intermarried families, the town is filled with friends and family, who would spread news of Nasar's doom relatively quickly. There is also the shop in which the Vicario brothers sit to wait for Nasar. Since the town is small, it is reasonable that many of the town's residents would pass through the same store on their morning's rounds and see the two men. This makes it more plausible that everyone might hear a piece of gossip within a couple hours. <br />Marquez also chooses to make the residents of the town relatively poor and not disclose the exact era during which the events occur. Through these two choices of setting development, Marquez makes it possible to remove the presence of automobiles, save the one brought in by Bayardo San Román. This lack of automobiles explains why everyone in the town walks everywhere, and lends further credence to the fact that everyone knew Santiago Nasar was going to die. Marquez's choice of setting has allowed him to create a reality that seems impossible, yet somewhat plausible, all at the same time.<br />The choice of setting only makes more reasonable a story line that otherwise seems impossible. Marquez may have created a setting in which it is reasonable to believe that an entire town would know a man was going to die soon. Even Marquez, though, cannot offset the mystery as to how Nasar himself could not know his fate. In his essay, Marquez speaks of \\"Latin America's impossible reality,\\" so in the end perhaps it is enough to know that Chronicle of a Death Foretold is set in Latin America. There is nowhere else that such an impossible reality could be possible.	2002-01-05
US	45808803	R2D5V9T38E0PO9	1861590660	145813925	A Sin of Colour	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Absolutely Amazing!!	Sunetra Gupta's 'A Sin of Colour' took me some time to read. Not because it was a difficult read, but because I kept going back and forth to savor the words and language, something that very few books have made me do, for some time now. <br />'A Sin of Colour' is about the choices made by its two main protagonists, Debendranath Roy and his niece Niharika during two different time periods, when both are in their late youth. The book oscillates between Calcutta, rural Bengal, Oxford and the US, with most of the action occurring in Calcutta and Oxford. Both are the victims of unrequited love; this colors their lives profoundly, eventually leading them to their sins. Debendranath Roy with Reba, married to his brother, famous, an artiste, musician and actress and Niharika with Daniel Faraday, married, friend of Morgan and the last man to have seen Debendranath alive. <br />Sections of the book are named after different colors, starting with amethyst and progressing through indigo, azure, jade, saffron, ochre and ending with crimson. Multiple sins of color, all revolving around the one sin which forms the basis of the book; Debendranath's retirement from this world, his ultimate freedom from the clutches of relationships and demands that are foisted upon most of us by the very fact that we live in the society that we do, a retirement that starts when he is assumed drowned in the waters of a river in Oxford. The sin of wanting true freedom, away from all bindings, social or otherwise; the ability to do what you want, when you want, the way you want to. The sin of 'sanyas'.<br />The book keeps jumping back and forth in time, sketching the lives and times of three generations of the Roy family and the house of Mandalay. There is a lot of repetition, yet it does not affect the book's intent. So, though we know of Debendranath's love for Reba in the first ten pages or so and of Niharika and Daniel midway through the book, each repeated paragraph throughout the book unveils a new vignette, a new facet that further enhances our understanding of the relationships and keeps our interest alive. Almost like a Lego building block, to be built a little at a time, slowly and suspensefully. <br />Sunetra Gupta's use of words is brilliant. The words play with each other, falling and tumbling, in long, uneven sentences, describing people, events and thoughts with the same verve as a film scene capturing the delicate nuances between the protagonists using gestures and mood-lighting with a minimum of action. For example, &quot;The earnestness of their exchange is tinged with the candour of lovemaking, the desperate need to lay bare the soul before divesting the body of its wrappings, the need to delight in common goals and to rake out the differences of opinion before entering into a concourse where nothing of that sort is likely to matter, the need to establish faith and hope before progressing to love.&quot; Each character also evolves over time, a paint stroke at a time, such that even near the end of the book, there is still some new aspect that we delightfully discover. So Reba at the beginning of the book is &quot;a beautiful woman who decorated her rooms nicely, baked excellent cakes, played exceptionally well on the esraj, and could scorn a person's indelicacy of manner with the faintest tilt of her eyebrows.&quot; Towards the end, &quot;A formidable hush seemed to descend upon the forests of pine and cedar as she walked in stately silence through them with her daughter, and when upon the seashore she burst into song, the waves would foam in awe at her feet. She was still as aloof to strangers, but now she seemed more distracted than dismissive...&quot; <br />Gupta's sentence constructions are interesting. Long sentences, some going on for almost half a page, filled with adjectives, descriptions, double metaphors, meandering through different thought processes and coming to a halt only when she seems to have run out of breath. The narrative unfolds in the nature of a conversational story-telling, picking one thread and jumping back and forth into the past and future, sometimes taking off on tangents and then coming back to the present to start another thread which also unfolds similarly. The dialogues interestingly, are all without quotes, and just blend in as part of the general narrative. <br />This is a book that has to be savored, like the last few licks of a honey nut crunch ice-cream swirling through our mouths, making us want more and more. There are three earlier books of hers, just waiting to be read.	2002-01-05

This is one book I've read over and over again, to understand how it appears to other people. Whomsoever have I met consider it to be rude and strange at first. What this book means to me is unsurpassed literature. It depicts rough love- a love that is as wild as the moors of England. Wuthering Heights breeds initself a &quot;horror of darkness&quot;, we sometimes breathe in our lives. The love existing between Heathcliff- the most loved villians of all time and Catherine stands strong. This book is about a stranger entering a household where he is rejected, and during this course betrays the one solitary feling in his heart- not being his love for Catherine, but compassion. The other half of the story reaches a point where Heathcliff takes his sweet revenge. There are no answers to questions like: Should a character like Heathcliff exist or not? I do not know. This is a masterpiece in literature depicting love, innocence lost, friendship, forgiveness and above all acceptance. Unfortunately, this was the first and last book of Emily Bronte.

Mind Boggling	On a breezy Sunday afternoon, I happened to read \\"The Death Of Vishnu\\" by Manil Suri. I picked up this book with great trepidation. Also, on the personal front, who would like to read about a man dying? That's what I thought until I read this one. As the title goes, the narrative also comes directly to the point - that of Vishnu, an odd job man, laying dead on an apartment landing of Mumbai. This is where the crux of the story lies.<br />Here we meet the Pathaks and the Asranis, two arch rival neighbours; what's worse is that they share the same kitchen and each claims to be taking care of Vishnu better.<br />Then on the other hand there are the Jalals - the husband who doesn't believe in any religion and just wants to gain spiritualism the easy way; the son Salim who is madly in love with the Asranis' daughter Kavita (here comes the Hindu-Muslim divide).<br />Not to forget the Tanejas - Vinod Taneja whose wife's death has left him with so much grief that he just doesn't get out of his apartment anymore... <br />And what's surprising is that all these characters are intertwined with one. And the connecting factor: Vishnu! The story binds itself based on what others perceive Vishnu to be - his mother, the Pathaks, the Jalals, the Asranis, Padmini, Kavita, and others like the scavenger and the sweeper working in the apartment. There is a holistic perspective to the point that it infringes on who Vishnu really is and what he embodies for all the bystanders.<br />There is a singular thread running through the book - that of isolation on various levels. The Pathaks and Asranis share a kitchen, almost to the point of invading each other's privacy and yet are so distant and cold. Vishnu is dead and yet no one wants to claim him and take him to the nearest morgue. Her husband and son, seeking refuge in intellectualism and staunch belief, leave Mrs Jalal alone.<br />Vishnu in another realm altogether believes that he is God (or rather is made to believe that by Mr Jalal) - Vishnu, who had ten reincarnations. His love for... Padmini, his longing for Kavita, and his thoughts on living make the book one delicious course.<br />This book is not an easy read. There are layers and sub-layers to this course though. On the surface, things are quite simple and easy to understand, but what Mr Suri has created is something else. He has created what one might call \\"a quilt of emotions\\" - right from love to the isolation one feels in the metropolis to the bare human nature. In short, Manil Suri has created a Universe in an apartment of Bombay - a city so huge and yet so cold and distant. So uninviting.<br />The spiritualism as one would expect from this book is on many levels rather ambiguous and unclear. In the sense that while the author tries to portray the elements of reincarnation and giving up on worldly pleasures - like Mr Jalal often tries doing - it all is actually a mockery of the same. One of the redeeming features of the book is that it is not written from an outsider's perspective. It is carved by an Indian living in India and breathing the air, which was what Vishnu did. An ordinary man elevated to something extraordinary to satisfy the superstitions and religious notions of the upper notches of society. This is where the element of comedy throws itself in your face.<br />The prose is certainly clever; however, the ending is left hanging. Possibly the author expects the reader to decide that for himself. In many ways, this resembles a grand chorus from a huge and wonderful comic opera, with all the inhabitants of the building singing at once. And underneath all the voices wailing about their personal concerns is the insistent bass of Vishnu as he prepares to die. Dealing with the most basic aspects of religion, love, and human kindness in a city setting which challenges its inhabitants to the limit, Suri creates a warm, funny, and very human drama of a every man's search for meaning in life.<br />Suri writes with obvious affection about a Bombay perhaps already lost, evoking easily its moods and attitudes, its light and smells. One can almost feel the heavy evening sea breeze, taste the roasted peanuts sold in paper cones along the sea wall, or see the Maharaja looking down from the Air India hoarding. A Bombay that rings true with its Irani Cafe, cigarettewalla, and radiowalla. Manil Suri's sharp eye for detail and natural ability to create a strong sense of place and time define his considerable talent, and one can look forward with a certain assuredness to its maturing in his promised books on the other two Gods of the Hindu trinity, Brahma and Shiva.	2001-05-24

I never read Haruki Murakami earlier till i casually bumped onto it while checking out ...  and then when i read the other reviews and the storyline, i knew i had to pick this one up...<br />Many of my friends who read this book earlier called it a &quot;strange love story&quot;. However i wouldn't classify it as that. to me the book ran deeper on various platforms of love and other such relationships. This book has re-defined for me the meaning not just of love, but of the madness associated with it too. <br />Then I went on to discover what was the actual representation of this mysterious, yet in many ways a most delightful book and i got my answers so fast...It was the missing person Sumire's story...it was her lover's quest to find her out and what he got were not just fragments of her life but more...<br />A must read for anyone who has ever fallen in love!	2001-05-23
