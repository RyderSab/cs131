However, this falls more than flat when it comes to humor or wit.  I think the author was going more for the tortured romance aspect, but it just didn't work.  The characters were both immature and contrived.  Before I buy her next book, I will await more reviews from Amazon readers.	2004-07-10

Second, the Mother is a drunk who beats her kids.  The book tries to redeem her and explain the reasoning behind beating her kids, but I'm sorry, I've had a tough life, and I don't see how beating my kids would help.  Of course, I have other interest than dwelling on old boyfriends, my nails, etc....  <br />As I said, I had a horrible life when I was a child. I left home at 14 because of it.  However, I managed to work my way through college, get a great career, find a loving good husband and have terrific kids.  I have known great women who are Sidda's mother's age who have overcome great adversities in their lives and did not have to cope with bottle or belt.<br />I'm sorry, but the sympathy for these characters, which I know the author was trying to bring out, never emerged.  I just saw them as shallow people relying on others to find happiness.  Never once did this woman (Sidda's mother) stand up to anything with her own two feet.....	2004-02-15

The colors that we go with, the way you should line your eyes, etc....  I don't usually buy make-up books because they never seem to have my eye-type or face-type, this book was wonderful in that I could at least relate to most of it.  I also liked the fact that the author kept saying that beauty comes in various ways, and it is more attitude than commercial.  <br />I also like the way most of the women were made up very naturally.  I wish I could have this woman do my makeup for me everyday, or at least a nice makeover, but this book is as close as it will get for me, and I consider it an excellent investment.	2004-01-02

I am so tired of people trying to answer the question &quot;Why is there suffering?&quot;  I guess I am not tired of people asking, but I'm sick of the answer, &quot;because it is what they chose.&quot;  I think if you were to ask any person with cancer or with a CHILD with cancer, it would be appalling and downright insulting to suggest that it was &quot;something they decided before they were born to have.&quot;  &quot;There are no accidents&quot; is a comment that is so common now.  Major cop-out alert!!  Whatever happened to the phrase &quot;sh*t happens.&quot;  Our job is to find ways to make the ones that sh*t happened to a little more comfortable, and to try and not make it happen again to other people.  I keep reading these books, and I keep going back to my science books.  In this case, I think even the most hardened scientist/atheist would have a kinder view of those more unfortunate than most.  As for God saying that people are hiding cures and conspiracies, I don't think so!  If you pick up any basic science book, you would see how elusive and difficult it is to cure some diseases.  This book is definitely for the layman, or I should say &quot;stupid person.&quot; <br />By saying that a person choses to suffer, that is the biggest escapism for us who do not suffer.  It lays the blame of their suffering somewhere else but not on us.  This book is dangerous, because it lays the blame on the one that is suffering.  They thought, they chose, etc...  No people, the suffering of every individual is not something they chose, it is something that just &quot;happened&quot;.  It is our duty as a feeling human being to try to alleviate their suffering and try to find ways of it not happening again.  How we do this, is where freewill comes in.  Maybe this is why we are here on earth.  To alleviate the suffering of others.  Wow!  What a concept, maybe I should write a book.  I think I hear God now, oh, gotta go.  God wants a ham sandwich.  What's that God?  Oh, withno mayo or cheese, God is lactose intolerant...  That explains alot!	2004-01-02

Well, I have struggled to get through the first couple of chapters, and I feel as though I am reading a Doctor Suess book.  I think this was written in a time where science was not known to very many, therefore it was written to appease the layman.  I was hoping for a little more than, &quot;if you are bad, this happens, or if you commit suicide than this happens&quot;.  No matter what, people still equate the afterlife to what is known here on earth.  Well, sorry to say, but I think it would be alot broader than &quot;Trees being more green, people going fishing,  etc...&quot;  Sorry to bring this down, but I think we know more about our universe and other religions now to put this book back on the shelf.

Step by step through arriving at the airport, take-off, during flight and landing.  I am not sure if it is the subliminal messages or the soothing talking, but it has made me alot calmer with flying.  I also listen to the CD before and during the flight (except take-off and landing...you have to turn off everything electronic) but by then, I am calm enough to handle it.  I still have my Klonopin handy when I fly, but this CD has allowed me to fly without having to actually take it.  Thank-you Mr. Harrold.

I read it while on vacation at the beach.  It was a perfect read.  I loved Kwan, and I wish I had a sister like her.  Olivia her half sister was a pain in the rear.  The book had two stories in one, so the anticipation of seeing what happens in both stories was a new experience for me.  Such a wonderful look at the culture of Chinese-Americans in San Fransicso.  I come from a Asian/Caucasian background, and was laughing at many parts of the novel because Kwan sounded so much like my mother.  &quot;Bad Luck-Bad Health this or that&quot;  Thank-you Amy Tan for writing such a wonderful story.

Yes, maybe in 1988, this book would have been &quot;farfetched&quot;, but since so many people like paranormals,especially werewolves, I think that this book if published now would have been a best-seller.  It is a comedic ride into a man who is turned into a werewolf.  His father is a big game hunter, and his mother, well, she's a vampyre.  The whole book is a hoot and a treasure!

This is the story of a Werewolf named Alexander, and his &quot;attachment&quot; to a human female named Tessa.  It is more of a study of werewolf behavior than a novel of feelings and emotions.  <br />In her book, werewolves are extremely vain, and humans are all stupid.  Tessa, the human character, does not seem to do anything to negate this theory.  She is gullible and sickeningly sweet.  Alexander, the main character, is  pompous, arrogant, and shallow.  You never seem to &quot;feel&quot; anything for him but annoyance. <br />I got so sick of hearing how great werewolves are, and how low humans are.  It must have been repeated about a hundred times.  It nauseated me to the point were I would call it &quot;racist.&quot;<br />The end of the story is the only reason I would give this two stars.  It was a twist of an ending.  A twist which wasn't great enough to redeem reading the entire book, but just enough to make it worth buying second hand (very cheaply).	2003-03-16

The stories were a little wierd.  There was quite a bit of sex, but towards the end, it seemed tedious.  There really wasn't any point in the act.  Some of the stories were good.  I enjoyed the one about the Acorn, Leaf woman.  Mainly because of the Sidhe being in \\"our time\\" and known and descriminated against.  I also like the Vampire one (there was only one Vampire story), but it ended abruptly. There was one about a \\"bird man\\" it was very short but cute.  As for the book being \\"erotic\\", it didn't give me a rise.  The stories were either humiliating and mean (the one about incest), or you just couldn't feel for any of the characters in any of the stories.  If your a romance reader, or a lover of paranormal stories, save your money.  There just doesn't seem to be any substance in any of these stories to warrant a good read.  If you like off-the-wall stuff, then maybe this is for you.	2003-02-01

This is the one where the heroine... is not pretty (ugly is the word she uses and others in the book).  Excellent dialoge, very thought provoking.  You don't even know what this Vampire looks like until the end, but you still fall in love with him.  Go figure, who can write a story like that!  I've read many romance anthologies, but this is definitely a keeper.  The last story is so deep, not your normal romance short story.  It is gentle and kind.  He is also not your run of the mill \\"suck your blood vampire\\" no spoilers...gotta read it.  It is a terrific variation on a Vampire stereotype.  Grab it while you can.	2003-01-31

I kept wondering why, and I guess it was because the author became a little more wilder than I could take.  I could kind of relate to the first half of the book \\"mother-in-laws\\" \\"wierd kids\\", but since I never hitch-hiked (or wanted to) I just could not relate.  Also, I was never into the \\"drug-scene\\", so I could not relate to some of those stories also.  I never picked apples, so I couldn't get into that either.  I am not sure I will read anymore of his books.  I like his style, but I don't think that his later life really interest me.  I am a lover of potty-humor, but the last part of the book didn't even have that.  It was kind of depressing.  If anyone knows of any good \\"coming of age\\" humor books, please throw in some suggestions.  I really do read the \\"favorite lists\\".  So I hope whoever writes them, still keeps going.  I personally love the Jean Shepherd books, they are dated (no potty humor-depression era), but they are still funny.  I also love Malcolm in the Middle (TV show) for dysfunctional family humor.  I also think Margaret Cho is a funny comedian...some of her stuff is on DVD...I love her Mom.	2003-01-30

Therefore, I thought this book would delve into the stereotypical Irish lifestyle. You know, \\"Quiet Man\\" and such.   Not so, this could have taken place in New York anywhere.  Don't get me wrong, It was a very cute Romance, and the author's style is very funny.  I just thought that they would talk in funny accents and stuff.  I apologize for wanting this, but hey, I'm writing anonomously.  So those of you out there who love the Irish and Scottish romances, be forwarned.  She doesn't have a nice \\"cottage\\", there are no \\"running brooks\\" or \\"funny priests\\".  Gosh, I feel like an idiot, but when I read, I would like to totally escape.  I felt as though this book just took me next door.  I think the author needs to be a little more descriptive.  I can't even remember what her mother's house looks like, or any of the other places in the book.  Of course, this book started as a best-seller in Europe, so I guess they can do without stereotypes or descriptions, since they live there.  All in all, amusing from an emotional aspect, but definitely not what I was expecting.  I think I'll go back to my historical romances written by American authors.  They are much more escapist and romantic. I hate to be an idiot, thank goodness for the anonymous button.	2003-01-30

This is coming from a man who was given this book by a friend as a joke.  I can't believe the whiners that show up as her case studies!  The author makes men seem so shallow &quot;what man wouldn't appreciate a beautiful wife by his side&quot;.  What is that?!  As a man, I appreciate the woman who has stood by my side for 15 years.  I appreciate her laughter, her anger, her spirit, her drive, and of course her love.  I have been asked the age-old question many times &quot;Would you still love me when my looks fade?&quot;  My answer is from my heart and soul and it is always &quot;I will love you for who are, and what you will always mean to me.&quot;  These simple heartfelt words are what my father had said to my mother, and they were together till they died.  Marriage is not always perfect, but if you have someone who is as screwed up as the guys in this book, go out and find a real man.  There are alot of them out there looking for a good woman.  This book by no means, describes entire male population.  There are &quot;Men who Don't Leave&quot;, and &quot;Men who when they say I Do, mean it for the rest of their lives&quot;  Just avoid the whiners, and the losers.  Good Luck!  By the way, if you are one of those &quot;Men who Leave&quot;  Grow-up!  You are the only one who you can blame your unhappiness on.  Have the courage to stay and make it better!

Okay, here is another book that was given to me as a joke for my birthday!  What is with guys these days?  I went through my fortys and fiftys working two jobs to get my kids through college.  I knew my responsibilies, and when I leave this good earth, I will have the knowledge that I left behind my legacy of hard work and honesty with my children.  THAT is the grand prize at the end of the fair.  Did I ever have feelings of regret?  NOT ONCE!  Did I ever look at my wife of 30 years with doubt?  NOT ONCE!  Yes, women, there are good men out there that don't dwell on things that are selfish and basically frivolous.  Yes, there are men out there that will treat you like gold.  Don't look for the touchy feely guys.  They have way too much time on their hands.  Oh, and for the guys who read this book?  Grow up!  Do some good before you die.  Make the ones who love you and care for you happy.  Believe me, when you look down that road, every bit of kindness and respect you have shown others will be your guiding light, and it will bring you the ultimate peace at the days end.  Start by bringing your wife a flower, and telling her she is the most important thing in your life.  Next, hug your kids, and tell them to remember that hug for the rest of their lives.  Next, tell yourself that you are a man, and that you are happy and content.  If that doesn't work, go down to the VA hospital, and talk to some real men!  You think life is hard now?  Listen to what they went through, and be glad you are living the life you have.  You are the only one who can make yourself happy, and there is happiness wherever you look.  I always find mine in the smiling face of my granchild, and the loving smile of my wife.  If she doesn't feel like smiling?  Tickle the heck out of her!  Life is truly a joy especially when you know that you've done right by the ones who love you the most.	2001-08-02

He also goes into name-calling and general nastiness.    I just wished that he would not have said that most children who are picked on, are shy children.  In my experience, it is the children who are different in someway (race, religion, opinions, dress, hair color, braces etc..) that brings on the teasing.
