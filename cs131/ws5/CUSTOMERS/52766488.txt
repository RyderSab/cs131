This book is simply essential. It exposes many of the myths we've been led to believe about how food regulation occurs, and what nutritional advice is valued, and which is discarded. It's not a \\"conspiracy theory,\\" although one might start to form that impression after the first 50 or so pages, all on one's own. Food companies and lobbyists, lazy/venal academics, complaisant nutritionists and greedy marketers all get the sharp end of the knife in this excellent book. Marion Nestle is superbly qualified to write this book, and has put together an excellent case illustrating how food issues have been politicized for years, leading to our current epidemic of obesity and diet-related diseases.<br />If you ever wanted to know why USDA is so hopelessly weak about nutrition issues, or how the FDA had its teeth pulled, just dive in and find out. 'Fast Food Nation' is almost trivial in comparison. The chapters on the manipulations of soft drinks companies in the school system, and the activities of 'supplement' peddlers will really shock you.<br />Buy one for any friend of yours who has the slightest doubt about the truth of the following nutrition message: 'eat less,' and 'eat less non-nutritious junk' in particular. If you don't accept that message, you have been *brainwashed*, and this book will show you just how it happened.	2002-10-13

You won't read long stories about the bacchanalian excesses of the 'digerati' here, but you will get a sound explanation of how this absurd self-deluding mania started, grew and ended. His analysis of the role of various Wall Street analysts in fuelling the hype is brilliant. I hope some of them go to jail!<br />Caveat: The book is characterized by some laughable typos and not a few mistakes on technology subjects. Don't publishers employ proofreaders anymore?	2002-04-27

Much of it is hype, or half-digested research work proposing cures for every known disease or ailment, &quot;and all you have to do is ....&quot;<br />Gawande is a brilliant writer, but his main gig is as a resident surgeon. He explores many medical issues and ethical dilemmas in this book, illustrated throughout with real-life examples and case studies. You are certain to learn something from reading his collected essays, even if he sometimes raises more doubts in your mind about medical practice than you might care to enjoy.<br />All of these essays have appeared elsewhere, but that doesn't detract from their power as a carefully sequenced collection.

But this book really got my attention. Solomon isn't some armchair theorist, she is an Antarctic professional, and an expert on weather conditions there. Taking a close look at what happened to Scott's 1911-12 expedition, and contrasting it with his earlier journey (with Shackleton) plus Shackleton's 1908 attempt, and the rival Amundsen polar bid, she shakes out a lot of rumors, innuendos and plain nonsense about what Scott 'knew' versus what he 'ought to have known.'<br />Scott has always seemed a stiff-upper-lip bumbler to me, and to some extent he was, but what happened is not as simple as it appears. He made some educated guesses, and he also made some mistakes. Using motor sleds was a waste of time, considering the poor engine technology of the time. He allowed someone else to select some unsuitable Manchurian ponies. He didn't trust dogs, based on prior experiences. He didn't pay enough attention to suitable clothing and sleeping bags. But he did set up a workable logistical system for his polar attempt, that should have worked.<br />So what went wrong? The factors above, plus too great a level of fatigue for his team. Poor Bowers ended up walking 400 miles in snow, instead of skiing. They didn't know, as we do, what a menace dehydration at high altitudes would be. Scurvy was poorly understood, and they probably suffered marginally from this, too. And finally, they set out for the Pole a month too late, and got caught in an extremely cold spell that made sledding by manhauling almost impossible. Solomon proves every contention with solid data from the expedition's copious records and from modern survey work. In the end, Scott died -- with Wilson and Bowers keeping him company, in all probability -- because he contracted severe frostbite in -40 degree weather. The idea that he was trapped by a '10 day blizzard' just eleven miles short of a supply depot is disproved by Solomon: the katabatic winds don't blow from the south for more than two or three days, it now seems.<br />This is a well-written, highly documented piece of work, and is not in any sense an attempt to 'whitewash' Scott. Starting late, and hitting some extremely bad weather was all it took to kill him and his four brave companions.just eleven miles short of a supply depot is disproved by Solomon: the katabatic winds don't blow from the south for more than two or three days, it now seems.<br />This is a well-written, highly documented piece of work, and is not in any sense an attempt to 'whitewash' Scott.

We heard some vague details in the revised edition of &quot;How The Swans Came To The Lake,&quot; and David Chadwick skirted the issue in various ways in &quot;Crooked Cucumber,&quot; and left us a few clues. I guess if one had lived in SF during that period, some of it would have surfaced in the local papers too.<br />So now we have a comprehensive overview of the Zen Center's problems, what do we do?<br />We carry on practising, and remember than people are only human. But if you want to learn how even the best-intentioned organizations can run off the rails, for your own future benefit, this book has a lot to recommend it. The author is not a Buddhist, but he is attentive to the topic, and presents what appears to be a fair and balanced account.<br />It's not mere gossip -- which would be Wrong Speech and Wrong View -- but an attempt to clarify what has been a mystery for nearly two decades. It doesn't reflect badly on Sunryo Suzuki, or on Zen itself, that wrong choices were made, and that selfishness and commercialism came to spoil the Center. Materialism and lust are powerful undertones of American society, and we must be mindful of them. Here, you can read of many who were not.	2001-11-26

Blair knows his subject firsthand as a submariner, and has brought a huge amount of data to play in his account. It's the definitive work on U-boats, and the various campaigns waged with them.<br />Blair's contention is that the U-boats never stood much of a chance to win the war, even in the darkest days of the Atlantic convoys, and were greatly assisted by inept A/S efforts by the Allies. Technologically outmoded, and not updated quickly enough, the German U-boats weren't produced in sufficient volume to ever achieve 'critical mass.' And money and efforts spent on pointless Kriegsmarine surface ships -- think of the Bismark and Tirpitz -- detracted from what good the U-boats did the German cause. The sophisticated types produced in 1944 and 1945 were too late, and too few in number, to make any difference.<br />To his credit, Blair tells of much more than the Atlantic war, and anyone who wondered about the Mediterranean theater, the Norwegian Sea, and Far Eastern 'runs' will find it all here, in great detail.<br />If anything, I wish he'd made the books longer! Quite often you get only a vignette about rather interesting developments or incidents. But, we should be grateful for what we have. His book on US subs in the Pacific --written before these -- is also quite remarkable.	2001-11-26

It's full of surprises, and you get to feel the identities of all the characters, whether real or 'imaginary.' Maybe it takes a while for the central character, Shadow, to become real, but then, that's probably the idea.

The authors are extremely well-informed, and have mapped out the recent history of biological warfare developments in some depth, based on three years of careful research for the New York Times. The problem is, despite ample warning, the US government has not treated this topic with the seriousness it deserves, relegating it to the back seat in concerns over nuclear proliferation and conventional chemical warfare (which is a second-best alternative, as all experts have realized for some time). The bugs are out there: The Soviets made enough to kill everyone on earth several times over. The Iraqis have plenty, too, thanks to the inefficiency of the UNSCOM's work after the Gulf War. Some 'favorite' bugs like anthrax and the extracted botulinum toxin only kill those they hit. Others, like smallpox, Ebola or Marburg Fever, will make the predictive powers of Stephen King's &quot;The Stand&quot; seem uncanny. They're &quot;the gift that keeps on giving.&quot;<br />This book will give you a new respect for Bill Clinton, who was at least awake to the threat. And new contempt for the pork barrel politics of the USA, since much of the money (billions of dollars) allocated to counterterrorism -- and biological warfare in particular -- has been frittered away on technology that doesn't work, and the high-priced but fatuous work of 'beltway bandits.' There's not enough antibiotics, there aren't enough trained staff, and there are few (or no) doses of vaccines for the threats.<br />Read it and weep, is all I can say. If you can get a copy, that is. It's sold out everywhere I went, and I finally got one by bribing someone at Borders to give up his own copy &lt;g&gt;	2001-09-24

Williams digs deep and wide to find material about Anson's incredible journey. Some events of the voyage of his fleet seem scarcely credible in hindsight: the use of invalids as troops, the death toll from scurvy, the series of wrecks and rescues.<br />If you didn't already know from the title that Anson actually succeeded in capturing the fabled Manila galleon -- though not where or when he anticipated -- you'd never predict it from the chronicle of disasters that preceded.<br />Many of the survivors of Anson's voyage -- by which I mean officers, because the toll about the folk on lower decks was extraordinary -- went on to become prominent naval heroes in the later eighteenth century, and he himself never looked back from this success.	2001-03-10

But to me, Ubik is a far greater work, rivaled only by &quot;A Maze Of Death&quot;. It's an extraordinary, hallucinatory fugue on the meaning of life and death, and completely unforgettable.<br />One suspects that PKD was experimenting with LSD or other drugs, and feeling the first signs of his own mortality. I've read it about twenty times. It works as straight s-f, as a tribute to Dante's 'Inferno,' as social satire, and as a parable on the nature of entropy.<br />If any idiot tells you that sc-fi is not a valid literary genre, thrust this book in their hand. You'll never hear that nonsense from them again.<br />This book is profound, yet extraordinarily funny. Reading it is a truly Zen experience, one the years will never dim for me.

And he does manage to prove a number of his main points. There has been a long term antipathy on the part of the Church towards Jews. That's admitted by the Vatican itself. Carroll's search for the roots of this attitude is quite convincing, and with the title, he puts a good deal of the blame on Constantine and his iconography of the cross. Less convincing is his attempt to paint the Catholic Church as the originator of all anti-semitism, and a precursor to the Nazis. Sometimes, frankly, he just loses the thread of his argument in the attempt to prove nearly all Catholic leaders, at all times, to be in the service of evil.<br />But you should read it anyway, Catholic or not. It does provide a guide to a number of fresh currents in theology, and an alternative viewpoint. Read it before of after Gary Wills' &quot;Papal Sin.&quot; They cover a lot of the same ground in different ways. Wills, to his credit, at much shorter length.	2001-02-27

And Burleigh doesn't make life easy with an idiosyncratic writing style that occasionally has you grabbing for a dictionary.<br />But one must persist in the interests of enlightenment. This is *not* your average potboiler treatment of the topic. Burleigh revels in the obscure, and brings deep knowledge of the Weimar Republic and its failings to the table. It is not a retelling of Shirer, but a fundamentally new approach to the familiar story, emphasizing the way the Nazis infiltrated and influenced everyday life, through such institutions as trades unions and the churches. He spends a good deal of time on the roots of extermination politics, which started with the mentally ill and disabled. He's by no means weak on the Shoah, but he does restore some much-needed perspective to the subject, and shows -- to the extent possible -- how it came about. The final desperate days of the Nazis are captured perfectly. And his chapters on the German resistance cast an interesting new light on the origins and motivers of those rival interests.<br />Throughout, Burleigh ignores the usual cliched &quot;dates, battles and generals&quot; approach to the subject, and brings a new understanding to the resistible rise, and inevitable fall of this bizarre pseudo-religion. I don't think you have a *choice* about reading it, because it is going to alter a lot of popular viewpoints over the next few years.	2001-02-27

Fleming recaps a period of manic exploration mania in British history, starting with the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and extending into the 1840s, with the Franklin expedition and its various would-be rescuers. Some of these stories -- those about the Back, Parry, Ross, Franklin et al. Arctic voyages -- have been told many times before. Others, like Laing's journey to Timbuktu, or James Ross's discovery of the Antarctic mainland, have not. Don't let familiarity with the period, or with some parts of the story, keep you away from this book.<br />One of the main reasons to buy &quot;Barrow's Boys&quot; is Fleming's dry humor, and ability to deflate the Dudley Do-Right pretense of some of the key players. Barrow himself emerges as a rather dull bureaucratic non-entity, but the frenzy of exploration he unleashed is anything but dull.	2001-02-27

It's rather hammily illustrated, kind of like a 1950s school textbook, which was what caught my eye. But the real reason to get &quot;Tinkering With Eden&quot; is that it features some of the best nature writing from a new author in some time. Oh, Ms Todd is a stylist and tends to get a bit florid or gimmicky at times, but she keeps to the subject pretty well. And the subject is one that affects us all: the way in which the environment is subtly (or not so subtly) altered by 'alien' creatures, whose impact no one expects. Where those aliens are commonplace critters like starlings, pigeons and ladybugs, not GMOs fresh from the sorcerer's lab...<br />Todd doesn't belabor you with unsubtle analogies like I just did. And she tells her stories even-handedly. One or two I've read before in other accounts (the gypsy moth, the starling), but you'll be knocked out by the fresher yarns about the 'Hessian' fly, the mountain goats, and the first-ever 'bio' solution, fighting scale insects with imported ladybugs. Don't go expecting any happy endings, though...	2001-02-27

She uses a lot of local (Cape Hatteras) analogies and personal accounts, and there's this feeling in the back of your mind, &quot;hmm, is this going to be just another nature book, about sand dunes and sailing ships?&quot; But pretty soon, you're hooked. I've not read better descriptions of the major wind systems, or of the origins of hurricanes.

I must admit I opened this book with some doubts, expecting to struggle through an &quot;Eric von Daniken&quot; potboiler of implausible facts and theories. To his credit, Keys doesn't venture too far from the historically  proven facts -- such as they are, because this is a poorly documented era  -- in his quest to puzzle out just what did happen to set the cultural pot  boiling so frantically in the period 540-650CE.<br />Trouble is, the  historically verifiable facts are very thin on the ground. But if you've  never pondered what sent Byzantium on its steepest nosedive, why Islam took  over so much of the Middle East in so short a time, what prompted the  collapse of the Celts, why several Central and South America civilizations  foundered around this time, here's a theory worth considering, if  'coincidence' isn't good enough for you ... a huge volcanic eruption in  Indonesia, with a consequent climatic upheaval (drought, storms, plague,  etc.)<br />Like all determinist approaches to ancient history, the theory is  essentially unverifiable, but it's an entertaining book on the darkest of  the dark ages, nonetheless. I'm sure academics can find much to criticize,  but it seems well-researched, and is very clearly written.

Few writers have gotten as deeply into Japanese thinking, or spelled out  the issues involving the use of the atomic bomb with as much care and  insight.<br />A lot of folktales and after-the-event hypothesizing are  deflated in ths book, which makes extensive use of statistics and analysis  to prove the case that use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was  pretty much inevitable.<br />Like all great history writing, you find  yourself saying &quot;I didn't know that!&quot; at least three times a  chapter. The book turns up remarkable stories about aspects of the Okinawa  campaign, a planned kamikaze mission against the B-29 bases in the  Marianas, the detailed plans of the Japanese home islands' defense  strategy, the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, and what the Emperor really  thought, at various phases of the end game of WW2 in the Far  East.<br />Credibly, he doesn't pull any punches about just how brutal and  impersonal war had become by 1945.<br />On a personal note, this book really  rang bells for me. I count myself lucky to be alive, in that my father was  scheduled to join the RAF Lancaster bomber group that would have backed up  the planned invasion of Japan in 1945. As he has said, very often:  &quot;the chances of coming back were rather slim. If it wasn't for 'the  bomb' ending the war in such a rush, you might not be around.&quot; Now, I  truly believe it.	2000-03-10

Jardine writes extremely well, but I felt that the repetitions -- which she warns of --  give the possibly mistaken impression that this was put together from notes  for a series of lectures. Personally, I could have read a much longer book  on the topic. But maybe what we see here is an abridged version of what she  had in mind.<br />But, try it anyway. This was a fascinating period of  scientific history, largely because so much of what was discovered was  found by a combination of chance and luck, rather than any careful  methodology. It's remarkably good on the subject of the much  underappreciated Hooke, and reminds you that Halley was a remarkable  character, famous for more than just 'his comet.'<br />The science of the  period is presented with great clarity -- more so than the amateur  tinkerers themselves were able to do -- and provides some interesting  insights into such topics as the rather shabby origins of the Ashmolean  Museum, chronometers, the first diving bells, early microscopy, the design  of St. Paul's cathedral, the inspirations for Newton's great works on  celestial motion, not to mention the reckless self-medication practised in  the period.<br />Oddly, most of the illustrations appear in both  black-and-white and in color plates, an oddity that the publisher might  care to reconsider.	2000-03-10

Probably the most interesting history book since Schama's &quot;Citizens,&quot; and for the same reason: it tells you things you'd probably never otherwise have known, and provides  context for them.<br />While the Seven Years War has always figured front and  center in European minds, it's been overshadowed in the US. But, it was the  first real 'world war'. It built the British Empire, and sowed the seeds  for the downfall of the western part of it, a mere ten years later.  Anderson knits the complex events together with great skill, and follows  the stories of the many seedy, greedy and incompetent players (along with  the patriots and professionals) as they try to first turn back the tide of  the French, and then figure out a way to conquer Canada. The insights into  the Indian aspects of the war are remarkable. There's a lot of  &quot;battles and generals&quot; writing, but he does not neglect the  stories of ordinary soldiers and civilians.<br />A lot of famous folk don't  come across too well in Anderson's account. His penetrating comments on  Washington and Wolfe won't make him a lot of friends, but, so be  it.<br />You'll come away from this knowing far more about the true reasons  for the Revolution, which was almost an inevitable sequel to this conflict.  I'd recommend reading it in conjunction with Kevin Phillip's &quot;The  Cousins' War.&quot;	2000-03-02

It won't change your life. Some reviewers have picked up on minor fashion flaws (and there are some), but you should form your own opinion about the  novel's overall verisimilitude. As a former victim/employee of several vile  NYC publishing conglomerates (but not CondeNast, so neatly speared here), I  can attest to the accuracy of many of Heller's observations. For a first  novel, it's pretty good, and can be placed in the same bracket as Hornby or  Buckley, Jr. He's best at impaling the absurd pretensions of yuppies, but  his grasp of office politics is quite profound, too. I laughed out loud at  several recognizable management succession scenarios here, and his acerbic  observation (which I paraphrase) that, &quot;25% of the people in  publishing are British, and the rest wish they were.&quot; It's safe to say  there are few likable characters, including the narrator. Which sounds  pretty much like megapubworld as I recall it.	2000-03-02

First, the author completely avoids the usual &quot;generals and battles&quot; approach to the trio of wars: The English Civil War, The American Revolution and The American Civil War.  Instead, he painstakingly follows what he sees as the 'real story', the  religious affinities and social aspirations of the patchwork societies of  the time. And how the push-and-pull between groups that can loosely be  characterized as puritans and cavaliers sparked each of these internecine  conflicts. The detail and clarity of the analysis is remarkable, but then,  Phillips is a political demographer and thinker of great weight, who  usually confines himself to modern times. You'll never think about the  origins of the US, the misfortunes of the Irish, or current affairs in the  same way again. It deserves to be read in conjunction with Fred Anderson's  &quot;Cauldron Of War&quot;, which covers an element that Phillips doesn't  spend much time on, the Seven Year's War (French &amp; Indian War).  &quot;Cousins' War&quot; is a virtual hymn to the stunning rise and success  of the US and the UK, whose centripetal forces shaped the 20th Century. And  will continue to be important long into this one. Don't hesitate to buy it!	2000-02-25

What distinguishes this from the pack is her clear grasp of De Sade's thinking, and an amazing knack of  making a pastiche of his style. The parts told in his voice really do sound  like him. The fan-maker herself is a less well-defined character, but you  find yourself believing her feisty responses to the dullwitted  Revolutionary tribunal. All the prejudices, pretensions and illogicalities  of the French Revolution are paraded in this short, but remarkably  well-constructed book. The fan-maker, her lover and De Sade represent  freedom, while the parallels between the Revolution and the Inquisition's  behavior in Central America are clearly drawn, in splendidly gory fashion.  Not for the timid or puritanical, but you won't read a better-written  'historical' novel this year.	2000-01-27

Step by step he takes you through his investigations and interviews, seeking to  prove the link between the sudden appearance of HIV-1 and some  shabbily-constructed mass trials of a polio vaccine in the 1950s. In a  vanity contest with Sabin and Salk, the lesser-known Koprowski took various  experimental shortcuts that seem reckless in hindsight. It's amazing to see  the way Hooper cuts through the obfuscations and obstructions of the  science establishment, and sifts facts from the few living people  associated with the trials. With the casual racism of the day, these were  mostly conducted in the Congo, or on handicapped children or newborns at  prisons and hospitals in the US. A sneaking suspicion that 'Hooper may be  right' builds into almost total conviction that this theory bears intensive  investigation by the time you reach the halfway mark. Almost incredibly,  the records of these 'trials' -- I put them in quote marks because they  were not properly conducted, by any scientific standards of today, or of  the time -- are either incomplete, or 'missing.' The book reflects no  credit on the drug industry, doctors' codes of secrecy, or medical ethics.  Quite probably, if Hopper has it right -- and it seems he does -- some of  the living players ought to be facing a grand jury investigation, in view  of the millions who have suffered in the resulting plague of AIDS. It's the  science book of the year, unparalleled since Rhodes' &quot;Making Of The  Atomic Bomb.&quot;	2000-01-24

A tale of exploration, coupled with an unfolding tragedy caused by bureaucratic bungling in  Washington and military incompetence on a grand scale. It's everything the  book blurb says, it's a Hollywood movie that should be made, and you  shouldn't hesitate to buy it.	2000-01-13

I can't think of anyone more deserving of a good biography than Elvis Costello. The greatest 20th Century songwriter -- and I include Dylan, Gershwin, Porter, et al., in that comparison. Well, this  isn't what we've been waiting for, by a country mile. A thrown-together  collection of press clips, apocrypha and tired gossip, with absolutely no  analysis of his lyrics and songwriting in general. If you're going to read  a bio, try &quot;God's Comic&quot; instead. It's no great shakes either,  but this is the pits. Why the publisher didn't just sling the MS in the  trashcan, I don't know. Obviously done with no cooperation from the subject  or anyone who knows the first thing about his music. Save your money.	1999-11-03

Disregard the negative reviews in the press, and try it. Criticisms that Athens' work -- which he describes in painstaking detail -- is in any way 'trivial' or  'subjective' are thoroughly refuted. For those who have grown tired of  wishy-washy psychoanalytical thinking about violence and its origins, this  is a refreshing piece of work. He destroys a lot of urban legends on the  way, and even gives some clues about how we might think of stemming violent  behavior's worst excesses. Buy a copy for your local politicians!	1999-10-18

Or, at least he did in the UK. In the US, his work has had very little exposure. The bio is fair, and explains a lot of Potter's obsessions (they  all became material for his work, which is a deconstructionist's paradise).  A little repetitive in places, Carpenter gives us a non-hagiographical  overview of the guy behind the twisted visions.	1999-10-18

And you can't fault Rushdie's skill with words. The puns and allusions fly thick and fast. But he fails to make any  of the central characters anything more than cartoonish. Avatars, he'd say.  Add to that the problem that the plot wobbles from one improbable event to  another. It's hard to swallow the idea that two essentially boring  characters -- Ormus and Vina -- could produce the kind of world-shaking  music Rushdie credits them with. There's a sneering tone about real stars  like the Beatles and Elvis, which many may find annoying. But then, he's  always been anti-Western culture, perhaps as much as he has been tagged  anti-Moslem. Far too long, too.	1999-04-28

This would make a hell of a movie! The characters are real, the plot develops with amazing skill, and it's as raunchy and side-splittingly funny  as anything Irvine Walsh has done. The drunken debauchery and fun-crazed  attitude of the teenage heroines of this story will make your eyes pop.  Flaming zambucas and a large tray of tequila shots all round!	1999-04-28
