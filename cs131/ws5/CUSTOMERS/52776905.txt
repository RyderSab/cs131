I love the recipes and the style of the book.  I already have Gourmet cookbooks for Italian cuisine, that's not what I was looking for here.<br /><br />For those complaining about the many shots of Giada and not enough of the food - have you seen the show???? - there are tons of beauty shots of her on the show, absolutely useless shots of her beautifully cutting food, washing her hands, eating with her friends and family.  Why are you shocked to find similarly useless shots in the book???  Why is this cookbook all of a sudden supposed to be the end all, be all of Italian cuisine with a serious Grand Master style when the show and the author are nothing like that?<br /><br />I don't need to see what cooked spaghetti looks like, so I don't really care about the lack of photography of the finished dishes.<br /><br />I want to know how to cook easy Italian recipes, without a lot of drama and snobbery, I've found that in the show and now I've found that in the book.	2005-06-14

True, some of the recipes don't quite hit the mark to what I am used to, but this is a great start.<br />I especially liked that the recipes list the cities or regions where they were created, and even mentions the fusion in Chinese-Peruvian and Japanese-Peruvian cuisines.	2002-11-07

Needless to say, the &quot;samples&quot; she brought were devoured in minutes.<br />Following her careful, yet simple, instructions and tips, will make for wonderful cookies and brownies.  These are the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made, and I have tried several recipes, and the apricot/lemon bars were also a big hit.  I am going to make several of the recipes here for Easter sunday with the family, and I am confident that they will be well received.<br />Ms. Medrich's other cookbooks are on my wish list because her recipes are to me, the standard in dessert making.	2002-03-28

It's amazing how often we only see the bad and never the good in our lives, so this is an eye-opener.  Cleaning your work area not only betters your physical space but it's amazing how lighter you do feel when you are not thinking (subconsciously or otherwise) about the files and folders that are everywhere.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is feeling overwhelmed by life and work, and while not all the exercises were my cup of tea, at least try the ones that make sense to you.<br />That said, there were a few suggestions that were a little bizarre. For example, when a friend calls to complain, to tell them they have 2 minutes and then they have to come up with a solution to their problem.  I understand if this is someone who continuously calls to whine about their boring life, but I'm sorry, if a friend needs comfort, then they should get comfort, not a &quot;2-minute&quot; limit.  Also, the suggestion to change your call back time from one day to a week made me laugh out loud.  I'd be out of a job if I told people I would get back to them in a WEEK!  This is just not feasible and I sure don't want to do business with people who take a week to get back to me.<br />Overall, like I said, this is a good idea, but take it, like everything else, with a grain of salt.  This won't work 100% for everyone.  I've taken some ideas I liked and ignored what I know won't work for me.	2001-01-24

It's very well crafted, with believable characters, and a tight plot.<br />I found myself liking Kathryn, who definitely bears the mark of having spent all that time in prison when she was accused of killing her husband, and she has such a hard time when she returns to the town where they lived, and tries to prove someone else killed him.<br />Great book, and I look forward to the next one!	2000-11-15

If you don't want to hear about encouraging money to come your way or stuff that's a little spacey, then skip the first tape, and get down to the nuts and bolts.<br />What Suze says is pretty much, don't avoid looking at your finances.  Understand what your debt means, instead of avoiding thinking about it.  And look at the big picture.  She has some sound advice for organizing your financial life, and takes you through the process of purchasing a home, and more.<br />Since she's made most of the mistakes she warns about, Suze doesn't come off as totally snotty or superior, she's just going through some guidelines that make sense.  I have no idea how people could get into financial trouble by listening or reading this book.  It's not like Suze points to a certain stock and says, Buy It!	2000-11-13

Tess Monahan, who has never - ever - been sick in all her life, is suddenly sick, and the whole town of Marigold thinks she's pregnant.  She's not, really, but no matter what she says no one believes her, not even Will Darrow, whom Tess has had a crush on for years.<br />Will likes Tess as well, but just the thought of being pummeled by her five brothers keeps him away, and hey, Tess is like a sister to him, isn't she?  Not anymore.  Will struggles with his undeniable attraction to Tess, not to mention the thought of the mobster who has impregnated her (Tess made that up).<br />I liked both Will and Tess, and Tess's brothers.  The only sour note would be just how overbearing and annoying the people of Marigold are.  Sheesh!  They bring her maternity clothes, furniture, baby stuff, etc. and at some point Tess stops arguing she's not pregnant.  I wanted to slap half of them for not believing Tess.<br />All in all, however, the relationship between Will and Tess is sweet and charming, as is Will's discovery that his feelings for Tess are not exactly secret.	2000-11-13

I thought the Anita Blake series was damn good, but the Merry Gentry series looks to give it a run for its money!<br />Merry is actually Princess Meredith NicEssus, the black sheep of the Unseelie court because she is not full-blooded sidhe.  Her aunt is the Queen of Air and Darkness and her son is heir, with Meredith next in line.  After enduring duel after duel at court, Merry has decided to escape and has spent 3 years in Los Angeles as a detective, with her guard always up against her vile relatives.<br />Now, however, her cover is blown, and her aunt has sent her men to take Merry back home.  Who Merry can trust and who will kill her without a second thought is a very dangerous guessing game, and often, loyalties change in a second.<br />This is a very gory, very explicit book.  If multiple partners bug you, or sex without love bugs you, or if you're squeamish, it may not be for you.  If you like tender romance or action without too much gore, there are plenty of other books, but for me, this was one heck of a read.  It's powerful and filled with imagination.<br />The rules of the Unseelie Court can always be bent, usually to the Queen's benefit, but Merry is no fool, and I will certainly be awaiting the next installment in this fabulous series.	2000-11-03

There, a series of characters - likeable and unlikeable - are well defined and add motive and strength to the book.<br />Jonah and Allie are attracted to each other from the get-go, and when Allie is threatened she moves in with him, much to her father's chagrin.  She is also instrumental in bringing Jonah back to her family, something he has always refused, because he's always felt he is not good enough.<br />All in all, this is a very enjoyable book, and I have bought the rest of the Night books to enjoy.	2000-11-03

Of course, no one believes him, and his own boss thinks Tom is having hallucinations caused by his injury.  Following more sightings, Tom persists, and enlists the help of his niece and her boyfriend (a very sweet relationship) and of Dr. Kelly Bishop, the girl next door that once touched Tom's heart.<br />Now divorced, Kelly realizes that her feelings for Tom have never gone away, but it takes a lot to convince him that Kelly wants more than a good time.<br />The book switches from a buddy story in WWII Europe to the present, where Tom and Kelly have to find love again amidst the lethal danger posed by the terrorist.<br />I liked this book a lot, the history part of it, the secondary romance, and even though the Tom-Kelly relationship is not the strongest part of the book, it is well drawn and realistic.  Good job, Ms. Brockmann, I await The Defiant Hero.	2000-11-03

What a brilliant start to a series.<br />When we meet Anita Blake, she's already got a reputation as the Executioner, someone who legally kills vampires.  In the world ms. Hamilton has created, the undead have some legal rights in the US, and one can't just kill them at will.  Not surprisingly, most of them know of, and can't wait to get their hands on Anita Blake.<br />When the master Vampire of the city (a deceptively angelic-looking child) wants Anita to investigate vampire murders, Anita balks, but the master threatens and nearly kills Anita before Anita gives in and agrees.  Also embroiled in this is flirtatious Philip, who learns what happens when someone defies the master, and vampire Jean Claude, who keeps hitting on Anita, hoping she will become more than his human servant.<br />This is a brutal book, filled with violence and gore, and yet, with the innocence and hope that remains in Anita's soul.  Sure, she is tired of having to constantly watch her back, but she is no bitter, jaded woman.  She is funny, too clever for her own good sometimes, and always ready to battle evil no matter what the cost.<br />I loved this book and went out and bought Ms. Hamilton's backlist as soon as I finished it.	2000-10-20

See, Eliza has been an underachiever all her life, a &quot;student from whom great things should not be expected&quot; and when she suddenly starts winning spelling bees, she bumps her brother Aaron off from his Favorite Child pedestal.<br />Eliza's father, a cantor, suddenly gives his daughter permission to enter into his world (and his study) while ignoring the son he has favored all along.  This is a catalyst for Aaron as well, who begins to look for what is now missing in his life in other places.<br />The mother, meanwhile, is quite horrible, and her journey is also not one to be missed.  All in all, this book can be quite depressing at times, but it has hilarious moments, and the writing is very accessible.  Ms. Goldberg's debut novel is, hopefully, only a sign of even better things to come.	2000-09-22

Why not? She's got money and hey, she just wants one, okay?  So since she  conveniently works at a sperm bank, she has the deed done (and  conveniently, that that's when her hymen was broken, as she tells the hero  when he ASKS WHY AN ADULT WOMAN HAD NO HYMEN) when she chooses the sperm of  a cute Dr. Brad Darling.<br />Brad has baggage, and he's got to be one of the  most unliakable heroes I have met.  He's a doctor?  Well, like the reader  below says, he can't tell how far along Ali is.  Nor does he know that not  all women keep the sacred barrier into adulthood.<br />Their romance goes  along nicely until she does realize she is pregnant after they've made  love, but then, of course, she was already pregnant via his sperm from the  bank.  The moment a roadblock comes up, he simply shuts her off and doesn't  even let her talk.  Not that Ali is that nice, either, she just spouts off  some nasty remark and stalks off.<br />I hope that between Brad's future  earnings (which he is really pychopathic about) and Ali's money, they set  plenty aside for that kid's therapy sessions.	2000-09-07

Wow, this is the first MacNeill book and I am going back for the other  two!!!<br />Rachel Fuller is running away from some baaad guys, along with her  two children, and the only place she can go to is her mother's house.  When  she arrives early, however, she discovers a naked stranger in her  bed.<br />Sean MacNeill doesn't know what to make of the bossy, rude  schoolteacher and her 2 bratty kids, he only knows that he wants her.  Rachel is skeptical of Sean's motives - is he living off her mother? and it  gets worse when he reveals he is now unemployed.  Although he is  hardworking at his craft (carpentry) it seems to Rachel her mother is being  taken advantage of.<br />Sean does prove he is more than some irresponsible  jerk, and he realizes there is some threat looming over Rachel.  In fact,  her late husband owed a lot of money to the wrong people at the time of his  suicide, and Rachel is in constant fear for her life and that of her  family's.<br />Little by little, Sean begins to earn Rachel's trust and  convinces her that the attraction between them is nothing to be ashamed  off.  As their love grows, the bad guys put their plan into action and a  showdown between Rachel and them takes place.<br />Although Rachel comes off  as a little haughty and arrogant, as more layers of her life are revealed  it all makes sense.  Sean, meanwhile, is a bad boy of the best kind, highly  sensual and always making (or wearing) all sorts of suggestive  remarks.<br />This was an extremely well written book, I am sorry I have never  read anything by Ms. Kantra before, but that is, happily, something I can  remedy.  I highly recommend this book.	2000-09-05

Attorney Jill is instantly smitten with the man she sees outside her  office.  He seems to need legal assistance, but her boss refuses to take  the case.  Intrigued, Jill offers to help him, in exchange for a teeny  favor.<br />Morgan can't believe that the angel he saw at the law office is  willing to help him, let alone in exchange for posing as her fiance for a  week, at her sister's wedding.<br />The mutual lust is undeniable, Jill makes  it clear that she wants Morgan and while he feels the same way, he wants  more then the casual fling she is offering.  Jill doesn't know what her  real priorities are and rejects offhand anything having to do with her  family, although her view of them is somewhat askew.<br />Morgan recognizes  this and as the days go by and he sees Jill interact with her family, and  the babies in the family, he sees that he can't settle for the brief  affair.  When Jill is offered a promotion and has to relocate, Morgan  simply bows out of the scene, leaving Jill to decide what is truly  important to her.<br />I really liked this book, both Jill and Morgan were  likable characters, and the love scenes were steaaaa-my!	2000-09-05

I tried 2 and didn't really like them, but after Where  Dreams Begin, I am glad I persevered.<br />Lady Holly Taylor is a proper  lady of her time, and a widow who truly mourns the loss of her husband,  George.  This in itself was great, since usually we have the widow who has  never loved before, but Holly has, and when her heart is once again,  awakened, this time to Zachary Bronson, she is shocked and saddened that  she could betray George like that.<br />Zachary, meanwhile, can't forget the  lady he mistakenly kissed in a darkened room and works it out so that Holly  and her daughter Rose come to live with him, so they can teach him and his  nouveau rich family proper manners and protocol.<br />As Holly struggles to  maintain her distance from Zachary, she realizes that she is losing social  standing by her close and scandalous association with this upstart who was  once a fighter.  Nevertheless, as she begins to fall in love with him and  with his mother and sister, society doesn't matter to her anymore.<br />This  was such a richly drawn book that I am looking forward to reading what I am  told are Kleypas's even better books - Then Came You and Dreaming of You -  Holly and Zachary are two truly well drawn characters who make the reader  care for them.  Rose is neither a brat nor a &quot;precious&quot; child,  and Zachary's humble mother, unused to her new luxurious life, is really  heartwarming.  a secondary romance is written well enough to interest, but  not overshadow the main romance.<br />I loved this book and recommend it  wholeheartedly.	2000-08-29

An embarrassed Teddy puts up with it, but she  does become intrigued by Austin McBride, her very own cowboy and owner of  Fantasy for Hire.<br />Actually, Austin is tired of the whole fantasy thing  and wants to get his landscaping business going, but when Teddy calls him  to ask him to pose as her boyfriend, he agrees, having become intrigued by  this very proper woman.<br />Teddy needs a temporary boyfriend because her  boss is a major creep who keeps making unwanted advances, and here is the  only weakness in the plot - I felt that as smart as Teddy was, she didn't  have to resort to some fake boyfriend to put her boss off.<br />The love  scenes are plenty steamy and both Teddy and Austin are nice characters,  making this a standout in the Temptation line, which so often offers just  plain old boinking sessions with no substance.<br />I really liked this book  and will read others by this author.	2000-08-29

This was such an unexpected good read that I found myself reading in  planes, cars, anything to finish it and pass it along to a friend.<br />Caleb  Carpenter is the leader of the Brotherhood of Blood, a racist, bigoted  organization that seeks power for the white race.  Recently, it has been  suggested that for the BoB to be more attractive to families, Caleb himself  should form a family, and he is interviewing potential candidates from all  over the nation.<br />Rachel Grunwald, daughter of a white supremacist and now  SPEAR agent, is enlisted and sent to Caleb for a 30-day trail application.  If Caleb likes her, he will marry her, if not, Rachel can at least find out  about Simon, a mysterious arms dealer.  Rachel is instantly drawn to Caleb,  and it's difficult for her to see in the man she wants, the evil man she  has come to destroy.  Caleb, meanwhile, wants Rachel, but he's got deep  secrets that could potentially destroy everything.<br />Wow, after Sharon  Sala's first installment, I expected the 2nd book in the SPEAR series to be  a let down, but if anything, I liked this book better.  Rachel is smart,  brave, courageous, great at her job and vulnerable when it comes to Caleb.  Caleb, meanwhile, is darkly seductive and although we know he is the hero  of the book, there are times where he leaves no doubt as to who he is in  the Brotherhood.<br />Fabulous book, I can't want for either the next SPEAR  book or Ms. Brant's next book.	2000-08-14

Logan Montgomery wants to escape the  life his father wants for him, and his meddling grandmother somehow sees  Catherine as Logan's way out.<br />During a party, Logan and Catherine are  instantly attracted to each other, but Catherine keeps in mind that she is  here to serve people like Logan.  Logan's grandma, however, works it out by  locking them together and when they finally are able to get out, it is  raining infernally and Catherine must stay at Logan's house.<br />Little by  little Catherine discovers that Logan is his own person, not a  stereotypical, shallow rich guy, but just as she is falling in love with  him, grandma's original plan to derail Logan's father's plans for his son  works like a charm, and Catherine is left, hurt, humiliated, and  angry.<br />Like every Blaze book out there, this is a steamy story, lots of  sexual tension and hot love scenes.  I liked both hero and heroine,  although the &quot;I can make your dreams come true&quot; line sounds a  little condescending to me.  Catherine starts out being a little too  influenced by her hormones, and not listening to her brain, but in the end,  this is a good read that I can recommend.	2000-08-14

Lucy Tait  has had a crush on Blue since she was a freshman in high school and he  saved her from a bunch of jerks who were beating her because she'd made the  boys' team.<br />Now, police officer Lucy finds that her attraction to Blue  has not diminished and he is equally attracted to her, but when his  stepbrother is murdered and all the clues point to Blue, can Lucy keep her  duty and her love for Blue separate enough to help clear his name?<br />I  really liked this book, Blue is such a nice guy and he keeps trying to  convince Lucy that he no longer wants his old girlfriend, Jenny Lee,  although Lucy can't believe he'd pass up a beauty queen like Jenny to be  with her.  Lucy's schoolgirl crush and later devotion to the hero-like Blue  begins to diminish as she accepts the faults the real Blue has, and her  love deepens as well.<br />After Prince Joe, this is a great installment in  the TDD books, I highly recommend it.	2000-08-02

Daisy was dying of cancer and  Jake's last request was that she marry him.  As Crash deals with his grief,  Nell goes about making arrangements for the wedding, and does everything  she can to entice Crash.  jake and Daisy think they'd be good together, but  a lifetime of distancing himself from people makes Crash do his damnedest  to avoid Nell, although he wants her more than life itself.<br />When Daisy  dies, Crash and Nell, alone in their grief, turn to each other and share a  night together, but Crash makes sure that Nell understands there can be  nothing more between them.  A devastated Nell leaves, and it's only a year  later, when Crash is wanted for killing Jake, that she sees him again.  She  helps him escape and as much as he tries to resist her help, this is not  something he can deal with alone.<br />This is another exciting book in  Suzanne Brockmann's Navy SEAL series, and it didn't disappoint.  I was  saddened by Daisy's death, and happy when everything was revealed at the  end.  I highly recommend this book.	2000-07-31

Here we have the first installment (of twelve) for a new series dealing with SPEAR, a secret agency.  Alicia Corbin has been recruited by  Jonah, the enigmatic SPEAR chief, to bring back Easton Kirby, who now runs  a resort where weary SPEAR agents go get some R&amp;R.  Jonah is being  framed, and he believes it's someone inside SPEAR, so his only choice is to  go to former agent East, who wants nothing to do with the  assignment.<br />Alicia is a brilliant agent, a genius whose IQ is off the  scale, but she's not comfortable flirting or charming a man into doing  anything, so she is puzzled at her assignment.  How can she convince this  cold, distant man to help Jonah when he barely speaks to her?<br />In truth,  East and Alicia are mutually attracted from the beginning, although he is  angry when Alicia's true mission is revealed, but soon there is something  even more important that needs their skills and attention.  East's son Jeff  has been kidnapped, and the stakes have become even higher.<br />I really  enjoyed this book, Sharon has a way with creating true emotional  connections between her characters and this was no exception - I look  forward to other SPEAR books, especially the last one, which will also be  written by Sharon.	2000-07-31

I finally found a copy of Prince Joe and it didn't disappoint.  A European Crown Prince is targeted by terrorists and as he is the spitting image of Lt. Joe &quot;Cat&quot; Catalonotto, Joe is enlisted to pose as the Crown  Prince, and hopefully become the target so that the would-be assassins can  be caught.<br />Veronica St. John is Prince Tedric's media assistant, and it's  her job to transform the rough, New Jersey-accented Joe into Prince  material.  Although Veronica is strongly attracted to Joe, and viceversa,  each believes that their worlds are just too different for a relationship  to ever work.<br />As time goes by and the two are thrown together, Joe and  Veronica realize that the danger of their mission might mean that they  don't have a future together, even if they wished to.<br />This is a great  book, the characters are well drawn and we meet several of the men who have  their own stories told in the SEALs' later books.  Joe Cat and Veronica are  characters to cheer for.	2000-07-31

As the book begins, Chance heads home to Wyoming to bring a  file so important that he must hand deliver it to Zane.  It appears that a  terrorist, Crispin Hauer, has a daughter who works as a courier.  Determined to catch Hauer, Zane and Chance set the trap for the daughter,  hoping she will lead them to him.<br />Sonia &quot;Sunny&quot; Miller has  spent all her life running from her father.  Her mother died in the attempt  and all Sunny has is her sister, Margreta, and even that contact is  minimal, only a weekly phone call Margreta makes to Sunny's cell phone - if  the phone call is missed, the sisters must assume the other has been  captured or killed.<br />When Sunny's latest courier delivery goes awry, she  finds a rescuer in pilot Chance McCall, who offers to take her to her  destination when she is almost robbed.  In reality, it is all part of the  trap, including the near crash that lands Chance and Sunny in a remote  canyon, without possibility of escape.  Here, Chance hopes to seduce Sunny  into confiding in him, and once she has, he will signal Zane to  &quot;rescue&quot; them, and Sunny will not be the wiser until it is too  late.<br />Linda Howard does not disappoint. First of all, it's great visiting  the Mackenzies again, especially devilish Nick :D and the Diapered escape  artists.  But this is Chance's story, and in Sunny Miller, he has met his  perfect match.	2000-07-24

What I found was a well-drawn pair of leads, writing that never jarred me out of the storyline and research that was obviously extensive, but not annoyingly  in your face.<br />John McCandless was Keely Wilson's track coach in school  and although the attractions was there, they never acted on it, until Keely  suffers a devastating injury, potentially career-threatening.<br />Her  reaction to Mac's condition is brutal, her awkwardness around him  believable, but she does her best to reconcile the fact that she has to  work with him, with the attraction she feels now.<br />I highly recommend this  book and Ms. Robinson is definitely on my authors to watch list.	2000-07-18

This is a wonderfully written, emotionally satisfying book with characters I cared a lot about.<br />Caroline Grayson wants tbreed flowers, unfortunately, in 1800s England women are not taken seriously as scholars  and Caroline's efforts to attend university seem thwarted.<br />Just when she  has made up her mind to leave everything behind and go to school (under a  name that won't reveal she is a woman) her father determines she is to  marry.  Her first meeting with the Earl of Weymerth is not a promising one,  but after the wedding, Caroline begins to discover just what a wonderful  person her husband, Brent, really is.<br />She must still decide whether to  give up her dream or to leave Brent, whom she has fallen in love with, not  to mention little Rosalyn whom she loves as well.  Brent's past as a spy  also poses problems.<br />I absolutely loved this book.  Caroline and Brent  are wonderful lead characters and I hope you'll give them a try.	2000-07-13

Stephanie doesn't believe he did it, but until she figures  out what is really going on, Ranger is a hunted man.<br />Hot Six does not  disappoint, whatever your feelings about who was at the door may be.  Steph's got feelings for both Joe Morelli and Ranger, and now we have to  wait another year for the next installment in this priceless series.  The  irrepresible Grandma Mazur is here, as are Lula and Connie, the bunch of  schmucks Stephanie has to deal with as she goes about her business.  I love  these books!	2000-06-21

Dream Man - In Orlando, Florida, Marlie Keen leads a quiet life after a brutal attack by a serial killer left her without her psychic powers.  Now, however, a new killer brings all the horror back and Marlie, once again,  sees everything the killer does through his eyes.  Detective Dane Hollister  (yum) doesn't believe her at first, and he even thinks she may be involved,  since she can describe everything that happened in the killings.  His  attraction to Marlie, however, is undeniable, and as he moves in with her  for protection, their relationship steams up, but the killer is still out  there.<br />After the Night - Faith Devlin is one of the &quot;trashy  Devlins&quot; in the town of Prescott, far removed from the Gray Rouillard,  the golden boy whom she adores.  One night, Faith's mother runs off with  Gray's father and a furious Gray kicks the rest of the Devlins out of their  tiny shack.  Years later, Faith returns to Prescott, a self-made  businesswoman, and must fight both her strong attraction to Gray and the  mystery of what really happened that night.<br />If you like strong leads and  stamy stories, this book is for you.  Dream Man is probably my favorite  book by Linda Howard, and although Gray is a little obnoxious here and  there, he is a sweetie at heart.	2000-06-19

I was very skeptical when I began reading The Passion - but right away I was captivated by Boyd's characters and her prose.<br />Tessa LeGuerre is the young human who nearly succeeds in killing Alexander Devoncroix, the  werewolf she believes killed her father; instead of killing her in turn,  Alexander amuses himself by &quot;adopting&quot; her and teaching her his  ways.  However, the relationship goes far beyond what Alexander planned,  and Tessa's existence ends up changing the werewolves lives forever.<br />The  world of the loup-garous is a very credible one, despite just how fantastic  they are, their families are filled with backstabbing and jealousies, greed  and overwhelming passion.  If you've been looking for a superb paranormal  read, give The Passion a try.	2000-06-13

This is such a great book, the luscious kind that just completely sinks you into the story.<br />Avery Thorne, his sickly, asthmatic past behind him, finds that his uncle Horatio has died and left Mill House, Avery's  inheritance, to outspoken woman's rights champion Lily Bede.  If Lily can  run Mill House for five years and show a profit for it, the place is hers.   If not, it goes to Avery.<br />A disillusioned Avery travels the world for  most of those five years, and as Lily must get to him a quarterly  allowance, they begin corresponding, most of their letters filled with  barely filled insults, which amuse Avery's fellow adventurers and Lily's  friends in Mill House.<br />Avery eventually comes home, only to find that the  spinster he expected to find is a beautiful woman, who nonetheless, suffers  the shame of not being accepted in society because of her illegitimacy.   Their first meeting is filled with tension and eventually they give in to  the attraction they feel for each other, but Avery will not have Lily  without marriage, and Lily fears her rights as a mother would be gone if  she married Avery.<br />Connie Brockway writes wonderfully lush books that  don't go into purple prose territory - her characters (main or secondary)  are always fully drawn and interesting, and My Dearest Enemy was a delight  to read.	2000-06-12

All he did was drink and waste away, and that's  not attractive.  And all Christy did was lie over and over, and that was  most cruel.<br />The endless love scenes are more repetitive than anything and  all in all, not a book I enjoyed.	2000-05-26

Kevyn's voice in this book is so nice and not condescending, that half the fun was just reading his anecdotes.  The transformations he effects on people are amazing, just look at the pages with his sister Carla!<br />The  looks presented toward the end are just amazing, the people are mostly  unrecognizable, but the first part talks about make-up for you and me.  Do  you want to spotlight your eyes?  Try the Julia Roberts smoky look, I did  and amazed myself!<br />I also like that Kevyn doesn't use brand names or  specific shades, I can't afford $50 eyeshadow, so I have to work with what  I can, or with a shade that I prefer, and he allows for that.  It's all  about your choices and what you want to do.<br />And that teacher's note at  the end is so sweet....	2000-05-11

His adoptive father, Ray  Quinn, is in an accident and is dying.  Cameron races in time to say  good-bye and to face reality along with brothers Philip and Ethan:  there  is a fourth Quinn boy, Seth, another stray taken in by Ray, who now needs  the three very different men to work together.<br />Anna Spinelli is Seth's  caseworker, someone who has to make sure that his best interests and needs  are met.  Although a romance between a caseworker and the boy's brother,  Cameron, is a major conflict of interest and a no-no in real life, their  relationship is sizzling!<br />This book was a great set up for the next two  installments.

Because she's dressed plainly, no one believes Lady Katherine St. John when she protests her kidnapping, and subsequent delivery to the hands of Russian Prince Dimitri.<br />Dimitri sees something special in Katherine, but it doesn't stop  him from taking her from London and sailing to Russia.  When he discovers  the truth, Katherine has (conveniently) overheard the nasty Russian  Princess who's after Dimitri so she goes home, and leaves Dimitri to look  for her.<br />There are a lot of coincidences, and too-perfect timing, and one  of my least favorite plot devices:  the hero who leaves the heroine in the  hands of his evil family.  But all in all, this is one of the better  Lindsey books.	2000-05-02

There was no way this book could rival that one.<br />Poor unattractive  Lenchen, and independent girl Louise are a delight to get to know.  Alice,  the selfless spirit who dies the youngest is such a tragic story.  I  recommend this book.	2000-05-01

Rosalind, who  already carries the memory of a bland marriage, agrees to marry this man  she hardly knows even though he begins to sink, his health deteriorating in  front of her. Even though we know Stephen will not die (he's the hero!) it  is Putney's brilliant writing that has us biting our fingernails as we see  that the number of pages in the book are less and less.

She is surrounded by rose petals, and still hears the echo of a man's voice in her head, calling her Princess. A wedding dress and veil are there, as is a bottle of champagne. A stunning wedding set sparkles on her finger. There's only one  problem: Temple doesn't remember getting married. Has she married the  fianc&eacute; she just broke up with or is there something else going on?<br />As  Temple begins to cope with the aftermath of her &quot;wedding,&quot; she  finds that she has almost nothing to go on except the marriage license with  the name Michael St. Gerard, her new &quot;husband.&quot; It's a name she  has never heard before, but a note from the mysterious Michael directs  Temple to Mark Challis, an investigator who is as dark and enigmatic as St.  Gerard, if he even exists.<br />When she returns to work, Temple's supervisor  shows surprise that the honeymoon was apparently cut short, while her  friend Annette (who also recommends Mark's services) is in shock when  Temple tells her the entire story. There is more, however: Temple is  pregnant. As a survivor of the deadly virus that killed her parents in  Zaire years ago, she fears that the virus might have been recently awakened  in her, or that it may damage her unborn baby.<br />Mark Challis and Temple  are attracted to one another, although Temple doesn't know if trusting Mark  is a good idea. When one attack after another threaten Temple's life, Mark  takes over and whisks her away to a secluded island where he usually keeps  clients who are in danger. Her only links to the outside world at that  point, are Dr. Llewelyn, who shows up regularly for check ups, and the few  phone calls she is allowed to make.<br />What is actually going on involves a  web of lies that rivals the premise of The Truman Show.

Although I had heard raves about this book and knew of the level of suspense in the story, I wasn't prepared to be as engrossed as I was - for the first two-thirds of the  book, that is.<br />In the wealthy and exclusive San Francisco enclave of  Pacific Heights, Michael and Barbara Florio's fifteen-year marriage has  disintegrated into a vengeful, dysfunctional relationship. When a  suspicious fire ends the life of alcoholic, pill popping, child-smacking  Barbara, Michael takes his two adopted daughters, golden child Devon and  &quot;crazed&quot; pyromaniac Therese, and heads for Urbino, Italy, to hide  out, leaving the investigators to wonder who really set the fire, Michael  or Therese.<br />Thirteen years earlier, Rebecca Carey had given up Therese  for adoption. Now she is recovering in a modest, but well-run Nepalese  hospital after nearly dying in a mountain climbing accident. Upon reading  the article relating the death of Barbara Florio, whom she had met during  adoption proceedings, she, too, takes off for Urbino, where a long ago  conversation indicates to her that Michael might be hiding. Her plan to get  a job working for the family, none of whom know who she really is, is  successful, and Rebecca finds herself drawn to the sullen, sometimes  violent child who once was her own.<br />While Rebecca slowly begins to gain  Therese's trust, much to Michael and Devon's anger, she is appalled by  revelations that make her believe that Therese's only chance rests in being  separated from Michael and Devon. Unfortunately, Rebecca is also attracted  to the dark, dangerous man, and can only wonder what will happen when he  finds out she is Therese's biological mother. When the police catch up with  the fugitive family, Rebecca takes the opportunity and flees with her  daughter to Mexico, where Ryan Foster, Therese's natural father, works in a  hospital.<br />Michael Florio is brilliantly characterized, and it was here  that I found both the strength and the biggest problem with the story.  Michael is seductive, dangerous, a psychopath to be sure, and Rebecca's  surrender to him was only to be expected. In contrast, Ryan Foster is a  little too conveniently placed and timed; after thirteen years, he is only  too happy to open his arms and heart to both Rebecca and Therese, to do  anything for them when he receives the phone that will change his life. I  ended the book feeling that Rebecca would never really forget Michael, an  unfair ending to Ryan and Therese as well.<br />Rebecca, on the other hand,  was not as well drawn and Therese's opening up to her seemed to happen a  little too quickly, considering how many other people had tried to get  through to the girl.<br />While the latter part of The House of Many Rooms  didn't shine as bright as the first two-thirds, most of the story was  indeed thrilling and suspenseful.pital.<br />Michael Florio is brilliantly characterized, and it was here  that I found both the strength and the biggest problem with the story.

A mermaid sits perched in the distance, waving to passersby,and for a moment, she smiles at fisherman Augustino Suarez, who'ssitting in a bar along with some of the other men who work thesea. No, he hasn't had one drink too many - it's just a reluctant Kiki Figueroa doing her part so that her family's new restaurant, &quot;La Sirena,&quot; will be a success.<br />To ward off a group of men with less than honorable intentions, Tino steps in and makes a show of being Kiki's boyfriend. A grateful Kiki, trapped in her mermaid costume, plays along and is stunned by her response to Tino's kiss, and his gallantry later when he carries her to safety after it begins raining...The internal conflict ends with about one-third of the book left, so the rest is filled with the obligatory appearance by someone from the past and then a last-minute fishing mishap that threatens Tino's life. Sub-plots for filler are generally more annoying than this, but these characters made up for the padding. It was so refreshing to see characters who refused to let a potential Big Misunderstanding even happen, who actually talked to one another and who weren't coy with each other, that I forgave the plotting problems.<br />Kiki is a very no-nonsense heroine. She's a little put off by Tino's initial obnoxious behavior but quickly sees behind the façade. She realizes she can be hurt again by putting her feelings out there, but she also understands that Tino needs a little prodding. The concept of family is important to her, and she'll do anything to help out the new business, even putting on a silly costume.<br />Hardworking fisherman Tino might be a little hesitant to pledge his heart to Kiki, but she soon becomes the love of his life and he knows it. He is thoughtful and gentlemanly, rescuing Kiki at the beginning of the book and encouraging her to get over her fear of the sea without pushing her too far.<br />The description of Latino culture is vibrant here - neither so in-your-face that it becomes annoying nor thrown in as filler. Since a large part of the plot revolves around Kiki's family's restaurant, the descriptions of Puerto Rican food were appropriate and accurate. My only concern would be all the phrases in Spanish scattered throughout the book, some are pretty obvious to figure out, some less. If you can get past this hurdle, there is a nice story and delightful characters to meet in author Vasquez' latest offering, Sea Siren/La Sirena.omes annoying nor thrown in as filler.

The problem is that the Delaneys  are a very respected and proper family, and Christina's coronation is just  the latest of the rebellious acts with which she's bombarded the family  since childhood. Cole and Christina's brother, Jack, must find a way to  deal with the scandal but Chrissy defiantly continues serving her chili and  kissing men in view of everyone in town.<br />What Chrissy's mother,  Elizabeth, daughter of the Earl of Thornbury, has in mind this time is no  mere reprimand for her wayward daughter. She will ship Christina off to  England to live with her grandfather - she's sent Chrissy away before, mind  you - and hopefully it won't be the Chili Queen who comes back, but a  properly behaved lady instead. Since Cole has been enlisted to go to  England to find one of the spare copies of the Declaration of Independence  of Texas, he is given the role of Christina's guardian. To Cole, who has  recently begun looking at Christina as much more than the annoying little  &quot;sister&quot; he always thought her to be, this proves unbearable  news, but his devotion to Elizabeth means he would do as she bid no matter  what, much to Chrissy's chagrin.<br />In England, Chrissy goes back to her  flirting-with-every-pair-of-pants-in-sight habits, her outward  vivaciousness hiding how dejected and miserable she really is because she  can never be what her family wants her to be. Cole spends much of his time  glowering at Chrissy's new fianc&eacute;, Lord Welby, and looking for the  long-lost document. It is only after Cole proves that he loves Chrissy as  she is - with a very satisfactory confrontation with her mother - that  Chrissy's fear of not being accepted can be conquered, and after some  revelations and dangers dealing with the Declaration, can the pair can  finally be together.<br />Chrissy gets a bit extreme now and then, and goes  through some personality altering throughout the book. She is either  kissing people in the town square or she is ready to marry a nobleman and  be a proper English wife, and it was a little difficult to reconcile her  repeated explanations of why she can't marry Cole with all the lovemaking  going on. Also, the main conflict is solved for her rather than by any  action she takes. However, she is a passionate heroine, one who demands all  of the man she loves or she won't have him at all, and I did cheer at her  happy ending.<br />Cole Morgan is Christina's match in every way, a fact that  surprises the heck out of him. The son of an English gardener and his wife,  he was raised in Texas by Elizabeth and is deeply loyal to her and Jack -  to the extent that for most of the book, he is blinded to the way their  rigidity is stifling Christina. He loves the girl he grew up with - and not  like a brother anymore - and won't give up in convincing her that she  belongs with him.<br />I enjoyed Simmer All Night a lot. Ms. Dawson's next  book, Sizzle All Day, is Jack Delaney's story in Scotland where he is  hunting down the Declaration. I very much look forward to it, and also look  forward to seeing what Cole and Christina have been up to by then.of not being accepted can be conquered, and after some  revelations and dangers dealing with the Declaration, can the pair can  finally be together.<br />Chrissy gets a bit extreme now and then, and goes  through some personality altering throughout the book.

From the opening pages you have non-stop activity; I must admit, however, that in the end, I just wanted it to be over.<br />After enduring a lifetime of abuse, Cara Tarakanov sees an opportunity to escape her evil  father, better known as The Butcher, while he is trading on the Alaskan  coast. Instead of the freedom she craves, however, Cara is captured by an  Alaskan tribe and forced into slavery. During a potlatch (the Native  American term for feast or party), Cara faces an &quot;honorable&quot;  death at the hands of her owner, and despairing, realizes that death is  probably better than continued servitude and abuse. Before she can die,  however, a man steps in and claims her for himself.<br />Tall Dancer, a  half-Russian Tlingit warrior, is instantly taken with the courageous beauty  who is bravely facing death, although he knows better than to take on a  responsibility like Cara. He is on his way home to be married, and although  he and Cara eventually become lovers, he knows where his duty is and it  certainly isn't in the red-haired slave he already loves. When the two  arrive at his village, Tall Dancer explains that he will &quot;give&quot;  Cara to his mother, and that Cara will have to pretend to be a slave, but  that his mother will know to treat her better than that.<br />The author goes  waaaaay overboard with Kaskoe, Tall Dancer's odious, evil, petty, vengeful,  spiteful, childish, and hugely overweight bride - and believe me, I am  being very kind here. There isn't one redeeming quality to her and she is  clearly there for the reader to hate from the first moment. Continued  references to her &quot;flabby rump,&quot; how her dress strains across her  wide girth and how she is more than twice the width of her husband are  unnecessary and became nearly as annoying as Kaskoe herself.<br />Raven's  Bride is filled with action and conflict from the get-go, and never quite  lets up. A lot of research went into the writing of this book and the plot  itself is intriguing, not to mention the unusual setting; some more  characterization would have made this a much better story - I certainly  hope to find it in Ms. Fox's next book.ite  lets up.

Unfortunately, this was the least of my disappointments as far as this book was concerned.<br />Lovely Serena is a  gifted young woman about to be married. She has been hearing voices since  she was little and, although, she doesn't know it, her gift is one that  will prove valuable to the inhabitants of the planet Ulata. While Serena  prepares her future home and wonders if she will ever truly love Trenek,  her betrothed, Commander Darian Vondrak watches from afar, and prepares to  take Serena away from everything she has known.<br />How does Serena react? We  never really know. We know she is enchanted by Darian and wildly attracted  to him, we know she wonders about what will happen to her when the strange  people she can't communicate with take her away, but it's a year before we  hear Serena's thoughts and concerns about her family back home. In said  year she has joined the Sisterhood of Trezhellas, a group of women who have  the ability to communicate telepathically, but that, despite their advanced  capabilities, have remained stagnated in the past. To say that Trezhellas  distrust men would be a serious understatement. They are annoyingly  anti-men and remain cloistered in their sumptuous mansion, undergoing  training and waiting for the time they will be called to service. Serena is  far more gifted than any of the other sisters and she is asked to take part  in a mission that will take her farther than any Ulatan has ever  traveled.<br />As Serena struggles with her decision, we find out (via  flashback) that she and Darian gave in to their mutual attraction and slept  together often during the trip back to Ulata. Serena is not sure she wants  to see Darian again, since time in the Sisters' company has convinced her  that he merely used her as he has many before and undoubtedly will use many  in the future.<br />Darian is, of course, torn between the woman he has come  to love and his duties as Commander of the mission. Actually, he really  isn't, because considering how many times he carries her around the ship  and how many times Serena forgets protocol and refers to him as &quot;Dar-  (insert image of Serena blushing here) Commander Vondrak&quot; it's no  surprise the whole crew quickly figures out their relationship.<br />While  Darian remained a blurry - although hunky - figure, he was easily the one I  liked the best. He admits and pledges his love to Serena and never wavers,  and he must also swallow his pride when she ends up saving him twice. He  also realizes Serena is keeping a secret from him, and even though it could  mean the difference between going home and ending up like the crew in Star  Trek: Voyager, he never forces her to admit what she knows. I ended up  howling with laughter, though, when, after a bout of lovemaking, Darian  jumps off the bed and announces &quot;we've just fired a probe&quot; -  Somehow I doubt my reaction was what the author intended.<br />Serena,  however, went beyond annoyance for me. She is beyond lovely, beyond gifted,  she is The Heroine Who Can Do Anything. Never mind she has never piloted a  craft before, never mind she hates violence, never mind . . . well, just  never mind. She is also aware that there is something in her world that  could make all the difference to Darian, but she keeps it secret,  questioning his motives although she knows by now he is a decent man.  Furthermore, she has the habit of asking too many questions. In her mind.  Did Darian know about her secret? Had he guessed? Would he leave her  without saying goodbye? Were the zhetlas the same as the teldas in her  world? Had she become a Ulatan and forgotten her heritage? And on and on  and on, for a total of more than one hundred questions throughout the book.  I know because I counted them. Did I grow tired of this? Did I wish Icould  skip paragraphs with question marks? Was I glad when this book ended?<br />Add  to this the fact that the Great Evil Enemy never makes a worthy appearance  and well, just about every aspect of this story failed to engage me. No hot  love scenes as indicated by the cover, no substance despite a plot that was  promising, and villains that spent 99% of the book off-stage, so to speak.  I will continue on my quest to find entertaining fantasy and futuristic  romances, but Starlight, Starbright is one book I cannot recommend.I could  skip paragraphs with question marks?

Aside from her family's declining social and  financial status, Alicia must care for her mother, who has fallen prey to  dementia. It's up to Alicia to save the family once it is clear that the  debt of 20,000 guineas will send them to ruin.<br />Drake is not prepared for  the woman who offers him her virtue as payment for her brother's debt. He  demands marriage, not just sex, and not because of any tender feelings, but  because his bitter enemy - the father who won't acknowledge him - Lord  Hailstock, wants Alicia for his own. To Alicia, who wishes to marry neither  man but is instantly intrigued by Drake, the choice comes down to who will  be considerate of her mother. Because Hailstock insists that Lady Brockway  be kept out of their lives, Alicia chooses to marry Drake, as long as their  marriage is a chaste one. Drake, who has agreed to no such nonsense,  figures his bride will soon succumb to his considerable charms.<br />Drake's  motivations (or seeming lack of common sense) were a little too convenient  to the plot. Aside from forcing Hailstock to recognize him in the eyes of  the society he'll be a part of, Drake would &quot;raise his social  consequence&quot; if he marries Alicia. Oh, really? Alicia's family was  nearly ruined, even before the disastrous loss of 20,000 guineas, and  they've been selling off family possessions and Alicia's clothes that are  not suitable for any sort of Season. Add to this the well-known dementia of  the Dowager and you have, in Alicia, a girl that no one interested in  social climbing would marry. Drake is kind and generous to every pregnant  maid, orphan, brain-rattled former boxer, etc., that he meets - this felt a  little manipulative after a while.<br />While Alicia manages to convince  herself that she is marrying Drake to save the family, especially her  mother, she soon discovers that she is attracted to her charming husband.  Misplaced pride keeps her from her husband's bed, and her only recourse  when she finds herself about to surrender to Drake is to hurl insults at  him. She started off as a likable, capable heroine, but she is also ready  to believe the worst of him, even though he has been nothing but kind to  her family.<br />There were other problems with this book, the worst of which  was Gerald's painless cure from his gambling addiction, and his new career  as counselor, working in Drake's hall. Anyone, with any form of addiction,  will tell you that his recovery was just a little too swift to have any  degree of verisimilitude.ges to convince  herself that she is marrying Drake to save the family, especially her  mother, she soon discovers that she is attracted to her charming husband.

The past line, where we see Jamie and Claire playing every card they have in order to stop Bonnie Prince Charlie's doomed uprising against the English in 1745, and when those efforts fail, doing everything they can to ensure that he will  succeed. The present line is where we find out that Claire returned to her  own time when Jamie realized that his Sassenach was pregnant, and on the  eve of the Battle of Culloden, sent her forward home to a safer time, in a  raw, furiously heart-wrenching scene filled with love, tears, blood, and  sex.<br />After giving up the man she loved with all her heart and soul,  Claire couldn't bring herself to find out what his fate was at Culloden  Moor, despite the fact that Frank Randall, her first husband was, of all  things, a Jacobite scholar. It is only twenty years later, when Frank is  dead, that Claire is absolved of the promise she made to him - the promise  to both allow him to raise Jamie's daughter, Brianna, as his own, and to  tell her nothing of her true parentage. Frank was, by all accounts, a  devoted father, and Brianna, who worships his memory, stubbornly refuses to  believe her mother's fantastic tale of living with a Scottish Highlander in  the 1740s for three years.<br />Regardless, Claire decides that now is the  time to find the truth. Helping Claire in her quest is Roger Wakefield,  whom we met in Outlander as the five-year-old adopted son of the Reverend  Wakefield. Roger, who will play a very important role in this and the  following novels, walks a fine line between his scholarly fascination with  the fate of the men who were such an integral part of Claire's life, and  his attraction to Brianna Randall. In the end, it is his discovery of a  document (a real life document which, according to master-of-research  Gabaldon, was the one that finally gave the character of Jamie his last  name) and the information in it that close the book, paving the way for  Voyager, the next installment in the series.<br />Claire, resourceful as  ever, moves easily from the rough conditions on the road to the warmth of  Jamie's family life at Lallybroch, to the gilded royal court in  pre-Revolutionary France. She is filled with sensual delight when it comes  to Jamie In modern times, she finds joy in her tall, redheaded, stubborn,  Viking-boned daughter, and continues to mourn the loss of her gallant  Highlander.<br />Jamie is as intense and striking a charcter as you will find  in any novel. His love for Claire is so deep and strong that he finds death  a preferable fate to life without her, and resigns himself to dying  honorably at Culloden. Loyal, strong, intense in every emotion, Jamie  Fraser is the redheaded stuff of which dreams are made.<br />This is  definitely not a stand-alone book, and after reading Outlander, I couldn't  well just stop there.

Rumor has it she murdered her philandering husband to be with her lovers, among which Lord Delacourt is her favorite. Her late husband's brother would like nothing better than to take the  children away from Jonet, and enlists his nephew, Captain Cole Amherst, as  reluctant help. Cole arrives at Jonet's house to find a very different  woman from that shy bride he met a decade ago, and is furious when he  realizes his uncle has not explained the situation to Jonet - as far as she  knows, Cole is there to spy on her, and once he has proof of her  unsuitability as a mother, he will help take her children away.<br />The  mutual lust ignited at their first meeting smolders throughout this book,  but it must take a backseat to the danger that envelops Jonet and her  children. If Jonet seems excessive in protecting her children - believe me,  she isn't, and once Cole realizes that she is not the hysterical murderess  that his uncle (who is also the children's ward) claims she is, he, too,  becomes not only the children's steadfast protector, but Jonet's as  well.<br />Although the villain's identity is clear to the reader early on, it  is not obvious to Jonet, Cole, or anyone else in the Mercer household.  Danger lurks everywhere, the targets are many, and the author manages to  instill suspense until the very end, although the timing of the climactic  scene was a little too perfect and the outcome was never in doubt.<br />Jonet  started off arrogant, rude, nearly hysterical, and I spent much of the  first part of the book disliking her - until it became clear just how  justified she was in her feelings. If anything, she was too trusting in one  instance, which proves nearly fatal to her and her children. What I did not  understand was her reasoning for keeping a secret from Cole until the very  end. Once she realized how much she loved the man and how much he loved her  in return, it seemed unnecessary.<br />Cole was a delightful hero. He was  sweet and honorable, unwilling to be his uncle's pawn, persistent where  others might have told Jonet to go to hell, unwavering in his mission to  keep the family safe, and that rare hero who has to be seduced by the  heroine. Although his station in society (he is a second son and a soldier)  is lower than Jonet's, do we really doubt this will be resolved by the  end?<br />The secondary characters are well drawn. Jonet's children are  typical boys who pound the heck out of whomever gets in their way, yet, at  the same, we see the difference in their ages. The innocent, carefree  younger child is tempered by the slightly older brother who understands  more than he should.<br />There are some pacing problems, though, which make  the book flow unevenly. A simple conversation will get  &quot;interrupted&quot; by paragraph after paragraph describing the  characters' thoughts and what the situation is, so that when dialogue  resumed I had to go back and check what the last spoken line had been. I  like introspection, but here, it occasionally gets in the way.

Adrian Wolfe is a feared pirate who holds no love for either the Americans or the British. As he arrives in New Orleans, he spots a young woman running away from a group of ruffians and promptly saves her. He is instantly besotted with this beautiful, impetuous girl who wears boots  instead of satin slippers and demands a kiss in payment for rescuing her.  When they meet again, outside her home, the results are slightly  different.<br />Carly Kelsey is determined to find her father, Captain Richard  Kelsey. After hunting unsuccessfully for him, she determines that her only  course of action is to go to the lair of pirate Jean Lafitte (the real  historical figure who aided future president Andrew Jackson in defending  New Orleans against the British) and find out if he's holding her father  hostage. Meanwhile, she has met a man who is miles away from everything she  knows, certainly miles away from the pompous, arrogant Roland Crawford,  whom her aunt and uncle want her to marry.<br />Carly and Adrian's attraction  grows after they are thrown together due to another reckless move by Carly,  one which nearly gets her drowned. Considering that Carly is due to return  home and marry Roland, she gives no thought to the possibility of pregnancy  or to her reputation were it known she has been traveling with such a  disreputable man.<br />There are plenty of other problems as well. The  secondary characters add nothing but stereotypes and dialects that typify  their ethnicities, but add no richness to the story. The villain was also a  disappointment, and there was never a mystery about his real identity -  even with the twist that was thrown in.<br />Did I look forward to reading  this book? Yes! I so wanted to read a good pirate romance, so that I could  recommend it to people who usually snub this particular type of book.  Unfortunately, The Last Pirate is one of the best reasons ever to avoid the  pirate romance.	2000-04-27

A filthy and bedraggled Kathryn Gray tells Lucien Montaine, Marquess of Litchfield, that the reason she's stowed away in his coach is because she was kidnapped and has just escaped from the villains' clutches,  and could she please stay with him until her father comes to pick her  up?<br />Although Lucien agrees to let Kathryn stay at Castle Running, he  knows that the story isn't all true - and he's right. Actually, Lady  Kathryn Grayson was committed to St. Bartholomew's Hospital (to use the  word loosely) for the Insane, because her greedy uncle, the Earl of  Dunstan, wants to keep her from her inheritance. She figures that telling  Lucien the truth would be as good as having her uncle find out that she's  escaped from St. Bartholomew's, so she makes up the abduction story. By the  time Lucien's messenger goes to Milford Park, her parents' home, and  returns to tell Lucien what is really going on, Kathryn will have figured  out what to do and be far away from Lucien.<br />Lucien, about to be married  to shallow Allison Hartman, is furious when he finds out he's been lied to,  and even more so when a desperate Kathryn tricks him into compromising and  marrying her. Lucien's initial chill toward his new bride eventually gives  way to unrelenting mutual passion, but Kathryn wants more substance than  just the life of a society wife. Her main interest, healing the human body,  is one Lucien finds strange and inadequate for a marchioness - even more so  considering that it was this interest that got Kathryn locked up at St.  Bartholomew's - and proves to be the one area in their marriage where  neither will give in.<br />Kathryn's actions, while not honorable, are  completely understandable considering there are no choices left to her -  even after the marriage, she and Lucien are not safe due to a clause in the  documents of her inheritance. A sharp contrast to the nitwit heroine whose  brains turns to mush whenever her mate is near, Kathryn wants more out of  life than passion in Lucien's arms, and the choice she makes in her quest  for a life of substance is heartbreaking.<br />Life was going to be so  perfect for Lucien - he was going to marry the perfect non-intrusive wife,  beget the required heir and, in short, have little to alter his way of  life. Then Kathryn shows up and not only shoots those plans to smithereens  but makes him examine those new feelings that seem to bloom whenever she's  near. He is determined not to feel any affection for the wife who has  deceived him so brutally, but he cannot help the change she effects on him,  much to the amusement of his friend Jason Sinclair, the hero of Nothing But  Velvet.<br />The secondary characters also add to this story. There is  Lucien's aunt Winnie who pines for the love that could have been, and  Michael, the boy Kathryn insists be rescued from St. Bartholomew's. Even  Kathryn's uncle is genuinely menacing until the very end, his appearance  shattering any illusions of security that Kathryn - and the reader - might  feel. And of course, Jason and Velvet Sinclair appear as well, hoping that  Lucien and Kathryn's story will end as well as their own did.<br />I wasn't  too thrilled with the long separation between hero and heroine, or with the  fact that Kathryn keeps a secret from Lucien until they are reunited, but  otherwise I can gladly recommend the very engaging Silk and Steel.hose  brains turns to mush whenever her mate is near, Kathryn wants more out of  life than passion in Lucien's arms, and the choice she makes in her quest  for a life of substance is heartbreaking. <br />Life was going to be so  perfect for Lucien - he was going to marry the perfect non-intrusive wife,  beget the required heir and, in short, have little to alter his way of  life.

We catch a glimpse of two very different worlds as in the village of Enniskillen, in Northern Ireland a husband and wife, Kennet and Peg O'Faolain, are violently murdered by Protestant extremists, their eldest child, Aisling, left mute by the horror of the attack. Meanwhile,  Kathy O'Faolain's life is turned upside down when her husband, Pearse, a  professor of Irish History at Trinity College, decides to take over for his  murdered brother and support Sinn Fein's struggle against the British.<br />Before she knows it, Kathy's placid life ends abruptly and she's bidding  farewell to all her friends and, along with their young son Sean, leaves  the safety of Dublin behind. Furthermore, in the O'Faolain home in  Enniskillen she must endure her sister-in-law Erin's continued verbal  attacks because Kathy can't let go of her dreams for a normal life. As if  that were not enough, Kathy suffers a wrenching loss and watches as Pearse  becomes a stranger before her very eyes, dismissing her as spoiled and  justifying the means the IRA uses to fight back.<br />As Kathy searches for  some meaning in her life, she becomes involved in the opening of a teen  center, open to Catholics and Protestants alike, despite the danger that  accompanies such a proposition. Violence becomes a part of her daily life,  and every knock on the door and phone call can signify bad news for the  O'Faolains. Erin finds love with a fellow IRA member, but the idyllic  marriage they enter is cut short when they are both sent to prison; Erin's  brother Conor pays for loving a Protestant girl when they are shot by Jack  Robinson, the same man who murdered his older brother Kennet. Robinson's  hatred for the O'Faolains stems from the killing of his sweetheart long  ago, but there is a cruel twist to his story that has turned him into a  complete psychopath.<br />Through it all, Kathy begins to see the situation  through eyes that are shifting perspective - no longer can she be so  distant and preach &quot;let's all get along&quot; when she sees that there  is no quick and easy answer to the hatred that runs so deep. Two  frightening confrontations with Jack Robinson end in bloodshed, but it is  an attack on young Sean's schoolbus that forces Kathy to leave Enniskillen,  and later, Ireland itself. Pearse lets her go, but his own imprisonment and  the seeming futility of his struggle make him wonder if there aren't other  ways to help the cause.<br />Kathy O'Faolain is a wonderful character. She  truly gives it her all when it comes to making a new life for herself  alongside Pearse, and she is strong enough to realize that, although her  love for him never falters, Pearse is now a different man from the one she  married. Her decision to leave him is heartbreaking and leaves her nearly  emotionally empty, but it is the only course she can take.<br />To Kathy, the  change in Pearse is almost frightening as he begins to reveal hidden layers  that years of normalcy in Dublin have softened. The man who adopts his  sister Erin's rhetoric and disrupts the only life Kathy and Sean have known  pays for his convictions. The continued killings and the loss of his wife  and child, force him, in the end, to evaluate what is right and wrong for  him.<br />Hardly a few pages go by before someone is killed or imprisoned,  and Bellacera never glosses over any of it. The constant fear and detailed  atrocities of what it means to be caught up in the violence of the Troubles  are vividly etched on each page, and remain long after the final page is  read.nt and preach &quot;let's all get along&quot; when she sees that there  is no quick and easy answer to the hatred that runs so deep.

In The Gatecrasher we have one such anti-heroine, but thankfully, she is surrounded by some of the most interesting and likable characters I have met as of late.<br />Fleur  Daxeny crashes funerals in order to meet rich, vulnerable men, and take as  much as she can get from them before moving on. She's been doing this  successfully for a while and has her routine down pat. When we meet her,  she is in the process of getting ready for the new batch of funerals coming  her way, charging her stylish new black outfits to her unsuspecting,  soon-to-be-deserted, Greek lover.<br />Her target at Emily Valour's memorial  service is, of course, Emily's bereaved husband Richard, a rich man who  mourns the wife he's lost but at the same time realizes the he's never  really known her. What Richard has never had is a passionate soul mate, a  woman who can make each day come alive and instill in him the desire to  truly live. Fleur is determined to be all that and more.<br />Little by  little we see Fleur stealthily become an integral part of Richard's life.  Damn his club and his gossipy acquaintances, Richard thinks. For the first  time in his life he desires and is desired, although guilty thoughts of  Emily do pop up whenever he's tempted to make love to Fleur, who knows that  Richard must succumb physically in order to be completely hers.<br />Richard's children are, of course, dysfunctional. Young Antony lives in  shame of the birthmark that made him imperfect to his mother and his social  life is painfully awkward and nonexistent. Daughter Philippa is married to  the odious and greedy Lambert, the man Emily said would be the only one to  marry an such an undesirable package as she. Needless to say, Fleur soon  realizes that Emily was far from a kind person, be it in the capacity of  wife, mother, or sister, and is soon charming Richard, his children, and  Emily's own sister, the initially reticent Gillian.<br />It is never part of  Fleur's plan to linger so long at Richard's, but first the lack of sex, and  then the fact that he hasn't yet given her a Gold Card (Fleur's preferred  method of getting her hands on her target's money) serve to stall matters.  Finally, Fleur's daughter Zara arrives, creating all sorts of complications  with Antony as a triumphant Fleur, Gold Card finally in hand, gets ready to  leave and move on to her next victim.<br />Richard is the most likable of men  - a little clueless when it comes to his children, but he definitely means  well. His feelings where Fleur is concerned are pure and tender, and I  couldn't help but feel for him as Fleur became increasingly bored with him.<br />Much like Zara does when she finds herself up against her mother's  machinations, I found myself losing patience with Fleur, and honestly  wished that she'd gotten more of what she really deserved. The ending only  works if one believes that the selfish, vain, greedy Fleur of 99% of the  book has really changed.<br />The secondary characters, however, were  priceless. Philippa's pathetic marriage to Lambert is truly sad and real,  just as Antony's desire to belong is heartbreaking. Gillian, who at first  so hated Fleur, made me smile as she succumbs to Fleur's charm and wears  the blue scarf Fleur gives her - every single day.<br />This book will  probably not be for everyone. Fleur is cold, ruthless, and calculating as  she begins to ensnare Richard, who never has a clue about the captivating  woman he's met. But if you're in the mood for a sort of Absolutely Fabulous  storyline with a bit less comedy, then I recommend you try The Gatecrasher.Emily's own sister, the initially reticent Gillian. <br />It is never part of  Fleur's plan to linger so long at Richard's, but first the lack of sex, and  then the fact that he hasn't yet given her a Gold Card (Fleur's preferred  method of getting her hands on her target's money) serve to stall matters.

Chieftain Conn the Ever Truthful owes his glory to Fintan, a blind warrior who has the gift of making his spear hit its mark with unfailing accuracy. Imagine Conn's horror, then, when a druid announces that Fintan's unborn child will be responsible for Conn's destruction. Fintan and his beloved  wife, Grainne, cannot believe that the child they have waited for all their  lives could cause the demise of their leader. With no other choice, they  accept Conn's decree that the child should be sent to live in a convent.  Conn's plans for the baby girl are far darker than anyone could imagine -  let's just say that &quot;Ever Truthful&quot; is the least appropriate  nickname for this man.<br />Twenty years later, Caitlin of the Lilies leads a  peaceful life with the nuns of St. Mary's. Once a year, she travels to the  spot where she was left as a newborn and finds a perfect lily there, a sign  that whoever her family is, they are still watching over her. This time,  however, Caitlin finds not the flower she expects, but a warrior who tells  her he has come to the Abbey to fetch a wench by the name of Caitlin of the  Lilies. After many tears and much grief in being separated from the only  family she's known, Caitlin leaves with the man, and they begin the journey  toward Conn's lands.<br />Niall of the Seven Betrayals is appalled by the  menial task he has been given. By God, he's a warrior! What's he doing  playing messenger and fetching wenches for Conn? In reality, his task is a  grim one, but he only finds out after he's been thoroughly captivated by  Caitlin. His decision is to take Caitlin to his family home - where he  hasn't set foot in years - and where they are received by his mother and  his young sister, who'd like nothing better than to bash Niall's head  against a rock.<br />The attraction between Caitlin and Niall grows despite -  or maybe because of - the huge difference in their personalities. Their  first interaction sets the tone for how I saw them throughout the book:  Caitlin skips toward the sea she is seeing for the first time; Niall saves  her when she nearly drowns, and then gruffly pushing her away so he won't  reveal how attracted he is to her.<br />Lily Fair has its share of problematic  details. Caitlin can be precious and melodramatic at times, going from  heartbreaking grief to innocent delight in a nanosecond, and by the fifth  time I read about her &quot;lily fair&quot; skin, or some variation on that  theme, I wanted to scream &quot;Okay! The girl's white, I got it! &quot;<br />Niall, on the other hand, is a dark and tortured hero, but unwittingly  naïve, given Cates' treatment of Conn; it would have been much better had  Conn not been so obviously evil from the very beginning. Niall is also  confused - was his father a good man or not? Was Conn responsible for his  family's ruin or are his mother and sister lying? Unfortunately, the reader  figures out the answers much, much earlier than Niall does.<br />This book is  not for everyone, the writing is sometimes overtly lyrical and lush, and if  this is not your style, you might not have the patience to stick with it.  However, the story beneath the ornate gilt is an interesting one, and while  Lily Fair does not match the quality of Gather the Stars, it is a read that  will be sure to transport you to the pagan Ireland of long ago.roughout the book:  Caitlin skips toward the sea she is seeing for the first time; Niall saves  her when she nearly drowns, and then gruffly pushing her away so he won't  reveal how attracted he is to her.<br />Lily Fair has its share of problematic  details.

Little does  poor Joe know that Gabrielle thinks he's been stalking her and that he's  about to have the tables turned on him with a blast of hairspray to his  face and a knee to his groin, not to mention the derringer she has pointed  at his nose. After he manages to get the upper hand and arrests her for  assault and lays the charges of theft in front of her, Gabrielle's only  recourse is to let Joe pose as her boyfriend and let him work for her at  her store, Anomaly.<br />Much of Joe's time at Anomaly is spent doing  handiwork and searching for proof to incriminate Kevin Carter, Gabrielle's  business partner, whom he believes is the mastermind behind the theft; the  rest of his time is spent trying to ignore Gabrielle and the mutual lust  they feel. The lust is there, however, tempered by the knowledge that  involvement between an informant and a detective is a no-no, but there are  several deliciously heated encounters before Joe and Gabrielle finally  consummate the relationship.<br />It Must be Love is pure enjoyment, and more.  Although plot twists and turns are spare, and although we have meet these  characters before - the macho cop and the airy-fairy free spirit - they are  set apart by how Gibson treats them. Joe can be a little raw at times and  claims he's willing to marry some attractive Martha Stewart-type who can  keep his house and keep him fed, but we know better than that. We know he  is no ordinary jock-stud who'll leave the little woman to clear the table  after dinner, and we know that once Gabrielle gets under his skin, he will  reconcile his abstract &quot;dream wife&quot; to the reality of the woman  he can't live without.<br />Gabrielle, who could easily have been annoyingly  &quot;out there,&quot; becomes instead a likable woman who simply views the  world from a slightly different perspective. She values a person's soul  instead of their looks, trusts her instincts, and is baffled by her  attraction to this man, who is unlike every man she's ever dated, who can  send her to prison if she doesn't cooperate, and who becomes the subject of  several of her paintings (and that is all I will say on that  subject).<br />The secondary characters serve to better define Joe and  Gabrielle; Joe's sisters may be annoying and obviously desperate to see him  settled down, but they are sweetly eager to show him at his best when they  see the chemistry between the pair. Gabrielle's mother breezily predicts  the arrival of a dark, passionate lover in her life, but is there for her  daughter when Gabrielle's heart is broken and she realizes she loves  Joe.<br />Although not a keeper for me, I found It Must be Love very, very  enjoyable. If you have read and enjoyed Rachel Gibson's books before, you  know you're in for a good time, and if you haven't, I strongly encourage  you to pick up this latest offering.en annoyingly  &quot;out there,&quot; becomes instead a likable woman who simply views the  world from a slightly different perspective.

I am happy to say, however, that it is an engaging story of two people who have pretty much accepted the terms life has to offer, and who, with each other, find much, much more.<br />Lord  Benjamin Whitbury and Miss Katherine Oakes meet when she, dressed as a boy,  is preparing to bid farewell to her horse, Fallen Angel. It's not just her  prized pet, you see, it's the symbol of everything Katherine holds dear,  because she adores anything having to do with horses. In fact, The  Repository, as her brothers call her because of her ability to store and  recall all bits of information regarding horses, is quite skilled at  calling races. Her years of dressing as a boy and actually going to the  racetrack, however, are over, since she has blossomed into an undisguisable  young lady.<br />But disguised she is, as Benjamin can barely credit his eyes.  Instantly he knows, however, that he holds the upper hand in this meeting.  Katherine pleads with Benjamin to keep his mouth shut and in exchange, he  asks for a kiss. Keeping his options open, however, he tells her (after  they've kissed) that he will hold her to granting him a favor sometime in  the future. When the favor turns out to be a pretend, month-long  engagement, Katherine is bewildered.<br />In reality, Benjamin himself is  being blackmailed, by none other than Katherine's secret fianc&eacute;, Cyril  Cullman, or as he is best known in Society, the First Beau. Cyril, who up  until now has been helping Benjamin gain his entr&eacute;e back into Society,  threatens to withdraw that frail hope of ever being accepted again if  Benjamin doesn't take Katherine off his hands. When Katherine tells Cyril  that this is just a farce because her papa owes Benjamin money, Cyril  smoothly replies that he will wait for her.<br />Benjamin is forced to go  along with a ruse he helped create - although the brother of a Marquess, he  is hardly welcomed in Society and, determined to make his own way in the  world, finds rejection extended to a lack of employment offers. As he and  Katherine parade around their phony betrothal, they begin to see each other  beyond the ruse that they're forced to live. At the same time, they know  that their time is short, and the planned quarrel that will end it all is  just around the corner.<br />Benjamin Whitbury has got to be one of the most  honorable and stoic heroes I have met in a long time. Not only does he not  wish to take advantage of his brother's money, but also he lives with the  consequences of his actions every day. Each snub, each rejection,  represents only part of what he has lost because of what he did and he  chooses to make the best of it without oodles of angst to irritate the  reader.<br />Katherine, in the meantime, was a bit more recognizable - the  Regency miss who doesn't follow Society's rules. She is puzzled by the  false betrothal she must enter, and is unbelievably blind when it comes to  Cyril's machinations. Her determination to make a life for herself is  understandable, although she does seem a bit naïve in how she goes about  it, trusting the one person who is forcing her to live a deception, even if  we as readers know Benjamin is honorable.<br />Katherine and Benjamin find  themselves gently drawn to one another despite the First Beau's  manipulations and their fake spat is truly sad, which makes their happy  ending all the sweeter.

Her  profession of surgeon serves her well in this book and her decades of  loneliness in the 20th century, while remembering the love she shared with  Jamie, only strengthen that love when they rediscover each other and she  sees how very much he has changed. Claire clings to the chance of happiness  she knows she is lucky to have, even if it means leaving behind her beloved  daughter.<br />The scene where Claire shows Jamie photographs of his daughter  Brianna, taken at many stages in her life, is heartbreakingly tender with  the pain of what could have been. Claire and Jamie do not dwell on this,  but instead face each new challenge together. Old friends and nemeses are  back, each of them adding their own piece of the puzzle to this intricate  story, but Jamie and Claire are, again, the center of it all. We know them  now and we cheer for each victory and despair at each cruel twist of fate.<br />In the end, the theme of Voyager is one of tremulous hope. Hope, because  this is a new beginning for Claire and Jamie. After all their  misunderstandings and disagreements have been dealt with, they find  themselves on a new continent which represents their new chance at a life  together. Tremulous because, let's face it, this is a Gabaldon novel, and  we have not only Drums of Autumn after this installment, but two, or  perhaps three more books. In any case, Voyager is a well-crafted work, not  overwhelmed by the carefully detailed research that has gone into it, but  supported by it.hotographs of his daughter  Brianna, taken at many stages in her life, is heartbreakingly tender with  the pain of what could have been.

US	52776905	R1BHESS5KONB7Q	0451198875	204208254	The Barbarian Earl	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Great regency	The plot involving a bastard of a nobleman marrying a pristine noblewoman who eventually succumbs to his charms is not a new one, but when done well, as in The Barbarian Earl, you end up with engaging characters and a book that leaves a smile on your face.<br />Years ago, the Earl of Stratham  pursued a haughty young woman who would have absolutely nothing to do with  him. Decades later, the old, dying Earl has neither a legitimate heir nor a  way to gain revenge on that woman; in Liam Campbell he finds both.<br />The  only reason Liam finds himself at his father's bedside is the promise of  money to any of the old man's bastards who comes to see him in his  deathbed. Liam despises the Earl, but the offer presented to him is far too  tempting: Marry Lady Alexandra Hennings - the daughter of the woman who  spurned the Earl - and inherit not only the title and homestead of the  Strathams, but also the immense fortune the Earl has amassed. Liam, tired  of living hand to mouth, figures he has nothing to lose and while he feels  for the young woman forced to marry the bastard son of her mother's  despised suitor, he knows that Alexandra must marry according to her  father's wishes, so it might as well be he.<br />Their wedding day is a  complete disaster, but the next few days, as Liam vows not to go to his  wife's bed unless she invites him, serve for the couple to get to know each  other a bit better. By the time Alexandra decides she wants to claim her  marital rights, Liam's past intrudes and he must leave her to help an old  friend. Not only that, but Liam, despite his growing attraction and respect  for Alexandra, has never told her how their marriage really came to be.  When she finds out - after they've made love - that Liam married her to  claim the Stratham inheritance, she is devastated.<br />Both Liam and  Alexandra are likable, three-dimensional characters. Alex may have started  out as seemingly shrewish and snotty, but that's all she knows, and given  the constraints of Regency society, her reactions to Liam's strange  notions, such as wanting them to dine with the servants, are completely  understandable. She proves sturdier than the &quot;delicate&quot;  aristocrat she's been brought up to be, and in the end, she is, indeed,  Liam's match.<br />Liam starts off like many a rogue who despises everything  to do with the nobility. He doesn't care for its rules, and if he can shock  a nobleman or two, all the better. Alexandra, who is only a useful bridge  to an easier life in the beginning, ends up stealing his heart. When faced  with losing her, Liam honestly tries to correct the situation. Not only  that, but he welcomes the family he's never had, and the responsibility of  caring for his wife's little brother.<br />The subplot involving one of  Liam's half-siblings fits well with the rest of the book, it doesn't feel  tacked-on or like it was there merely to add pages, even though the  identity of the real villain is clear from the moment he appears. Fiona and  Adam, the hero and heroine from A Touch of Magic, also make an appearance.<br />After spending several enjoyable hours in Liam and Alexandra's company,  I will definitely be searching for Ms. Miller's previous books.the constraints of Regency society, her reactions to Liam's strange  notions, such as wanting them to dine with the servants, are completely  understandable.

Their grim task, as outlined in a letter Gabby  leaves behind for close friend Eleanor, is for Elly to go through Gabby's  papers, personal documents, unpublished manuscripts, etc., and deal with it  all. As Elly enlists the help of the other three women and they settle down  to fulfill their late friend's final request, they begin sharing parts of  their lives that have remained hidden through all their years of  friendship.<br />The four women are wonderfully human, non-cardboard  characters who deal with the little - and sometimes big - struggles of life  and find succor and support in one another.<br />We have Barbara Ann, the  midlist romance writer who seems to be the one on top of it all - happy  family, book after book hitting the shelves - and who is, in fact, about to  explode from frustration. While Barbara Ann simmers, Sable Tennet is  discovering life without make-up. This polished woman (think Danielle  Steel's career and Sable the Wrestler's looks) finds that she can live in  sweats and knit shorts, walk around barefoot and not lose face in front of  her friends. Meanwhile, mystery writer Beth finds her writing to be the  only refuge from her abusive pig of a husband, until the strength of the  other women begins to slowly seep through her. Last but not least,  intellectual Elly, the academic writer who hates children, is tired and  afraid of continuing her life as she has lived it for years - keeping  everyone at a distance.<br />As summer progresses, the women begin facing  their inner demons; Beth, the youngest and shyest of the four women, makes  a decision but keeps the reader guessing as to whether she will go back on  her word. For Sable, it's facing the ghosts, coming to terms with events  from nearly twenty years ago and setting free the girl she once was. While  Barbara Ann makes a drastic change in her life after she ends up in jail  because of her inconsiderate, slovenly family, no one expects dry spinster  Elly to change much, and in the end, her story is all the sweeter for it.  Gabby's house gets a little more cramped with the arrival of her mother,  Ceola, with eight husbands to her name and a knack for manipulating the  four women into catering to her every need. Four healthy women are not  enough to contend with Ceola's softly voiced demands and she ends up  staying, and becoming part and parcel of the group.<br />There is also work  to be done, however, and while contracts are drawn and manuscripts  resuscitated, a single masterpiece emerges: Gabby's own love story, told in  a book that will be fiction to everyone else, but to the friends, it will  provide the final chapter to the story they only knew bits and pieces of.<br />I liked this book - a lot. While the ending might seem rather tidy  considering how real each woman's set of problems was, it is not totally  unrealistic. Each of them has changed for the better, but has not lost what  made her unique in the process.

All Drake wants is to get his hands on his family home, which has been bestowed upon his brother Cedric, marry Cassandra because he must, and then abandon her as soon as he is able to. When Cassandra overhears this, she is understandably upset. Unfortunately, this was one of the extremely rare occasions when anything Cassandra does makes any sense.<br />To call Cassandra spirited would be a mistake - shrewish and irritating would be more like it. She slaps Drake more than once, yells and screams at him every chance she gets, disobeys him left and right, fights off clans in order to prove herself, and generally behaves like a two-year-old - she wants what she wants when she wants it. Not even her &quot;gift&quot; of receiving other people's feelings through touch did anything but make the scene of their wedding night thoroughly confusing.  Drake was little better - they get close, he rejects her; they kiss, he rejects her; they make love, he rejects her.... A grade of D-.<br />Jill Henry's Sara's Gift was a sweet, heartwarming story about love healing old wounds. Sara Mercer is a widow on her way to a job and, hopefully, a new life. She can't help herself, however, and makes a stop in Moose Creek to see the child she gave up for adoption four years earlier. Her stop is lengthened by a heavy snowstorm and, with the train passengers taking every available hotel room in town, she ends up staying in the same house as Mary, her daughter, and Mary's adoptive father, Sheriff Gabe Chapman.<br />The attraction between Sara and Gabe is palpable from the moment he helps her off the stranded train, and so is Sara's growing guilt at knowing she is deceiving both Gabe and his sister, who quickly enfold the lonely Sara into their family routine.<br />My main problem with the story is that we are told that neither Sara nor Gabe has ever loved like they do each other. Considering they were both married before and considering how little they really knew each other, this seemed a little too convenient and unrealistic, and so did Gabe's acceptance of the truth of Sara's identity.  I don't see why Gabe and Sara couldn't have loved their spouses and also found joy and love with each other. Mary was a little too grown-up for a four-year old, but all in all, this was a reasonably enjoyable story. A grade of C+.<br />Tracy Sumner's When All Through the Night was a wonderful finish to this anthology. When we meet Katherine Peters, she is absolutely through with Tanner Barkley. The cad had apparently been using her for a big undercover story for the newspaper, and when the story appeared, Katherine was left beyond humiliation at discovering that her first and only lover had been merely using her. Of course, this is not really how things really happened....<br />These were two likable people. Katherine is determined not to have her heart stomped on again, but her feelings toward Tanner are justified, considering that she doesn't know all the details. Tanner's efforts to gain back the love of his life are endearing and I found myself rooting for him. A grade of B, and I understand that this is the sequel to Ms. Sumner's Carolina Rose, which I definitely intend to read.<br />Christmas Kisses was worth reading for Tracey Sumner's story. Her story, along with Jill Henry's, went a long way toward removing the bad taste left in my mouth after reading Christine Cameron's contribution. Spending quality time with Sumner's characters will surely warm the reader and bring a little Christmas spirit.Sara nor Gabe has ever loved like they do each other.

One of my least favorite books ever is Kurland's Another Chance to Dream. While The More I See You doesn't match the poignancy and feeling of the former, it (thankfully) doesn't drown the reader in bleakness like the  latter, and I found it an enjoyable read, with lots of wit and tender  moments.<br />Jessica Blakely is a successful composer and musician who  yearns for the magic of love. At the moment, unfortunately, she is stuck in  England, wearing medieval clothes for a party at a castle, and accompanied  by a dull suitor who wants to be her knight in shining armor. Literally.  Wishing upon a star to find her a man who loves her, Jessica's walk around  the castle lands her in the 13th century, startling both her and the party  of men who want the &quot;fairie&quot; dead on the spot.<br />One of the men  is Richard de Galtres, a dark and brooding knight who saves Jessica from  the rest of the group. Despite Jessica's strange accent and speech, the men  end up believing that she is related to the King. They think she is  babbling incoherently because she hit her head when she fainted, so they  take her back to Burwyck-on-the-Sea, Richard's ancestral home. Once there,  Jessica and Richard begin to get on each other's nerves, and much to their  respective dismay, a mutual attraction begins to grow.<br />While Jessica  adjusts to life without 20th-century comforts, she begins to appreciate the  man hidden underneath Richard's gruff exterior; the discoveries she makes  about his past help put some of the pieces of the puzzle together, and she  finds herself yearning for a mere smile from him. For Richard, the  endlessly annoying woman who claims to be from another time becomes a  necessity to him, which he realizes when he nearly loses her to a traitor's  blade. As he tries desperately to close her wound with a red-hot knife, the  only way to take Jessica's mind off the pain is to distract her with the  betrothal ceremony. Although this results in the couple's being bound by  law, they are nonetheless unsure of the other's feelings.<br />There is a lot  of humor in this book. Jessica starts off unwilling to compromise on her  notions of modern behavior and can get a little too cutesy with her  American slang, but she means well, and in the end, she gets exactly what  she deserves: A man who adores her, even though he might not understand  everything about her.<br />Richard, could have been your typical, brooding,  tortured hero. Instead he is a likeable wounded soul - Kurland can write  those like few authors can - and he very slowly and very carefully begins  to accept that this is the woman who has conquered his heart.<br />Characters  from other Kurland books make their appearance here, one even meets his  demise, but if you've read Stardust of Yesterday, you know that everything  turns out well in the end - I only wish Richard and Jessica had known as  well.

As a wedding reception winds down at the ritzy Mark Hopkins hotel inSan Francisco, nineteen-year-old Daisy Parker loses her virginity toNick Coltrane, her former stepbrother. Unfortunately, the haze ofpleasure vanishes as Nick casually gets dressed and recants all the love words he fed Daisy, then takes off, leaving her hurt, humiliated, and disillusioned.<br />Nine years later, it all comes back to haunt her when Nick, now a famous San Francisco photographer, seeks Daisy's services as a security specialist. The former Oakland PD officer wants nothing to do with him, but since her security business is barely off the ground and she can't in good faith, leave Nick's safety up in the air, she reluctantly takes the assignment and moves in with him....<br />As Daisy struggles to keep Nick in one piece, she becomes part of his world, finding out that the man she's tried to forget for nearly a decade is not the womanizing monster she's made him out to be, while Nick gains more and more respect for the woman who keeps saving his life....<br />Daisy was a kick to get to know. She is strong and courageous, knows she's damn good at what she does, and lets Nick know it all the time.  At the same time, she is so vulnerable where he is concerned that I couldn't help but feel for her. Even when Nick is telling that he loves her (both in and out of bed this time), Daisy can't let herself dream that he means it and vows that he will not break her heart. Which, of course, is just what he does.<br />Daisy is not the only one who's tried to forget that night nine years ago. Nick, confident that he'd gotten Daisy out of his system, is bowled over by the cocky woman who fires his blood and can flip him over and send him flying across the room. He realizes he should have told her sooner the truth about Douglass and the photographs, and never mind goons or his work. His world really comes crashing down when Daisy leaves him.<br />The secondary characters, including Nick's sister Maureen and her husband, and Daisy's friends, add to the plot and become integral parts of the story. The only parts of the book where I had to invoke suspension of disbelief were whenever J. Fitzgerald Douglass appeared; he went just a little over the top in his mafia-boss impersonation, and the fact that a lot of circumstances had to align properly in order for the picture in question to be that explosive.<br />Otherwise, this book is pure Andersen, the chemistry between Nick and Daisy is red-hot, the love scenes even more so, and the language a little raw. Suffice it to say that when Nick and Daisy make comments regarding &quot;the thinker&quot; and &quot;the Big Guy&quot; they're not exactly referring to another person in the book. So far, I have liked all of Susan Andersen's books and this was no exception.  And it's set in San Francisco - what more could you ask for?
