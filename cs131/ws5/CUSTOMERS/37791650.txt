Happily, this turned out to be true. <br /> <br />Of course, it doesn't hurt that the story in question here is part two of a cliffhanger.  Picking up where The Seven Crystal Balls left off, it chronicles Tintin and Haddock's trip to Peru, where they believe they may find the missing Professor Calculus.  Along the way, they team up with a boy orange-seller, Zorrino, who assists them on their quest.  The perils come fast and furious in this one, and around every corner - one of the hallmarks of the best Tintin stories.  As an added bonus, there is an entertaining sub-plot involving the animosity between Haddock and various llamas.  Then there is the extraordinary resolution, so highly improbable it truly is impossible, but the logic of which is completely satisfying.  It resolves not only the entanglements new to this story but also the conflicts that have been plaguing our heroes and others abroad since the last book.   <br /> <br />The best thing about Prisoners of the Sun - as is the case with most of the Tintin sagas - is the indomitable friendship between the characters.  It may seem a basic element (and indeed overlookable at times), but without it there would have been no Tintin, and there would have been no stories.  At least, not in any recognizable form.	2005-09-14

The mystery begins at a variety show which Tintin and the Captain attend that evening.  One of the performers, a clairvoyante, is suddenly seized with a vision that an audience member's husband is in great danger.  Shortly afterwards, it is announced that the woman's husband has indeed been taken seriously ill. <br /> <br />The woman's husband, as it happens, was one of seven explorers recently returned from a voyage to South America to study the Incan mummy, Rascar Capac.  As the story unfolds, the six other explorers - including Professor Calculus' ebullient friend, Professor Tarragon - are also rendered comatose by what appears to be the curse of the mummy.   (\\"This will lead to trouble,\\" a stranger prophetically warns Tintin at the beginning of the book, as they are travelling on a train and Tintin is reading about the explorers'  expedition.  \\"You see if it doesn't!\\") <br /> <br />The plot thickens even further, however, when Calculus, taking a stroll around Professor Tarragon's house, discovers a striking gold bracelet, puts it on (remarking on how nicely it goes with his coat), and then mysteriously disappears.  It is up to Tintin and the Captain to find him -- but the mystery is left up in the air until the next Tintin volume, Prisoners of the Sun. <br /> <br />One final note: Also vitally important to this story is the return of Tintin's old friend General Alcazar, now performing as a music-hall knife thrower under the pseudonym Ramon Zarate.  His knife-throwing partner, Chiquito, proves to be a prominent character in this mystery.	2005-08-17

In this tale Tintin and company set out upon the sea to find the buried treasure introduced in the previous story.  Along the way we are introduced to a few of the most integral Tintin elements: Captain Haddock's family estate, Marlinspike (originally Moulinsart), where the characters will live for the remainder of the series; the deaf, absentminded, and wonderful Professor Calculus (Professor Tournesol, or Sunflower, in the original version); and plenty of antics from the Thom(p)son twins along the way.    The ending of Red Rackham's Treasure is perfect and truly puts the series in motion, setting the stage for some of the most wonderful Tintin adventures of all.  If not for this one, they might never have been!	2005-05-30

Reading through Lauren Myracle's TTYL, it's easy to label it as a literary travesty.  The instant messaging format is awkward and often frustrating to read; the reliance on gratuitous grossness is often oppressive.  On the other hand, the story has its good points, too.  Not many outweigh the bad, but some are notable.  First of all, it truly does portray middle- and/or early high-school stuff to a tee (the only exception to this being that IM punctuation is typically WORSE).  Second, all three of the girls' stories are entirely believable, and one is truly compelling.   <br /> <br />A brief summary of their stories: Angela (screen name SnowAngel) is a hyper, boy-crazy soul whose reckless crushes consistently leave her crushed.  Madigan (a.k.a. mad maddie) is the \\"tough one\\" who ends up making a huge mistake and paying dearly for it.  It is the story of good-girl Zoe (a.k.a. zoegirl) that is the most gripping one.  Her exceedingly creepy teacher, referred to only as Mr. H., is putting the moves on her.  Zoe is the most innocent of the trio and is all but oblivious to Mr. H's intentions until it just might be too late.  It is at this point that the friendship between Maddie, Angela, and Zoe comes to the fore - and proves that it is the saving grace of this story.	2005-05-27

The Secret of the Unicorn - La Mystere de La Licorne, or the Mystery of the Unicorn, in the original French - is the eleventh installment in the Tintin series.  It was also evidently the personal favorite of author Herge.   <br /> <br />Like many other Tintin adventures, it spins out of something as seemingly innocuous as can be: Tintin goes to a street fair, sees a model of a ship that he likes, and decides to buy it.  Almost instantly two mystery men are hot on his heels as he leaves the place, offering him exorbitant amounts of money.  He manages to lose them before he gets back to the flat, but needless to say, this is not the last we've seen of these two in The Secret of the Unicorn.   <br /> <br />It later turns out that the ship is a small replica of a real vessel, the Unicorn, that was commanded by none other than Sir Francis Haddock, ancestor of the Captain and possible originator of such Haddockisms as \\"thundering typhoons,\\" etc.  It also comes to light that hidden in the model are parchment scrolls indicating something important about the original ship, which sank ages ago.  But by the time Tintin finds this out, his ship has mysteriously disappeared...! <br /> <br />The Secret of the Unicorn as it was originally published in the magazine Le Petit Vingtieme was far too long to be contained in one book; it spills over into a sequel, Red Rackham's Treasure, in which Tintin and friends take the sea to find the sunken Unicorn - but that will have to wait for another review! <br /> <br />(Incidentally, to anyone who wonders, the scale on which I am rating these books is one to five for Tintin, not one to five for everything else.  In other words, it starts with great and goes on up from there.  Three stars = no slouch.)	2005-05-18

The Shooting Star - L'etoile mysterieuse, or The Mysterious Star, in the original French version - is the tenth story in the Adventures of Tintin series.  It is also the second featuring the colourful Captain Haddock, always a welcome and comic addition to the otherwise tense (but still wonderful) tales. <br /> <br />In this adventure, a mysterious shooting star and an unexplained heat wave are rumoured to signal the end of the world -- that is, until eccentric Professor Decimus Phostle proves otherwise.  Phostle (perhaps a predecessor of Professor Calculus?) determines that these oddities are in fact caused by the emergence of a new element, which he names phostlite after himself.  The adventure itself revolves around the professor's - and Tintin's, of course - quest for a lump of the material itself.  Of course, the perfunctory bad guys are determined to get there first. <br /> <br />Comedy is lent, as always, by the aforementioned Captain Haddock, who moonlights in this book as the unlikely president of the Society of Sober Sailors (or S.S.S.) and by Tintin's plucky dog Snowy.  The Shooting Star is followed by an adventure in two parts, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure.	2005-04-29

So begins the story of King Ottokar's Sceptre, the eighth story in the Adventures of Tintin series.  One would think if one were Tintin, one would know better than to endeavor to return a lost briefcase to its owner.  Although then, of course, there wouldn't be any story. <br /> <br />The briefcase belongs to Professor Alembick, a sigillographist (defined in the story as a collector and admirer of wax seals - I have yet to discover whether or not this is a real word).  Of course, the quintessential slew of dastardly figures are immediately out to get Tintin.  The eccentric sigillographist himself seems safe enough ... or IS he? ... <br /> <br />Eventually this adventure leads Tintin and Snowy into Syldavia (ruled by the titular king), a fictional country which was to play a prominent role in a number of later adventures.  There their mission - frought with the perfunctory peril at every turn, of course - is to return the monarch's missing sceptre to him.  This story is notable in that it introduces the great character of Bianca Castafiore, the world-famous opera diva who only sings one song.   <br /> <br />The next few stories also introduce major players, and it is then that the series truly finds itself In The Zone -- perhaps not an expression Herge would have used (assuming it has a French equivalent), but personally I like to think he might have.	2005-04-22

It wouldn't exactly seem the obvious thing to set off an entire Tintin adventure, but then its predecessor, King Ottokar's Sceptre, began with a misplaced briefcase. <br /> <br />The Crab with the Golden Claws may not be the most wonderful of all Herge's Tintin stories, but it is definitely one of the most memorable.  This is due in no small part to the introduction of the series' most colorful character, Captain Haddock.  He enters the tale at the weakest we ever see him - a miserably drunken wretch upon whom Tintin accidentally stumbles while stowing away on the ship Karaboudjan. <br /> <br />Whether or not Herge intended Haddock to become a regular character, I don't know, but it is obvious almost from his first panel that he had the makings of one.  The epithet-spewing captain was a necessary force in the stories, necessary for balancing Tintin and then necessary for balancing Professor Calculus when he came into the series ... and then there are the stories with Bianca Castafiore ... the list goes on! <br /> <br />The aforementioned crab tin is notable in that it is one of a veritable arsenal of them being used to store opium by the nefarious first mate of Captain Haddock's ship.  The Crab with the Golden Claws is a gripping and entertaining story, complete with a desert scene that truly makes you feel thirsty.  Oh, yes, and Tintin gets drunk.	2005-04-22

It differs greatly in appearance from its immediate predecessor, The Broken Ear, bearing much more of a resemblance to the later tales.  This is due to Herge's redoing the artwork and story long after its original incarnation (as a serial in the French children's magazine, Le Petit Vingtieme). <br /> <br />The story is frought with peril as is the case with the vast majority of Tintin adventures, but in this case it is not as interesting as the beautiful artwork (particularly in the case of the island scenes themselves - breathtaking! Look at the detail in those rocks).  The Black Island is also noteworthy in that it introduces the character of the villainous Doctor Muller, who appears again in two later stories, The Land of Black Gold (under the alias Professor Smith) and The Red Sea Sharks (there calling himself Mull Pasha, but playing a smaller role). <br /> <br />The Black Island occurs chronologically several tales before the entrance into the series of several of the most important characters (Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus, Bianca Castafiore, etc.), so we encounter here a much smaller cast: Tintin, Snowy, and the Thompson twins are the only prominent characters. <br /> <br />L'ile Noire (its title in French, of course) is a beautifully composed book which is a must-have for any Tintin fan and worth at least one read-through by everyone else.	2005-04-21

It is also the first of the Tintin stories set in fictional Hispanic land San Theodoros, which (along with some of its natives) is to play a much greater role in later tales.  The \\"broken ear\\" in the title refers to that of the Arumbaya Fetish, a small tribal statue whose theft from a museum is what begins the story. <br /> <br />In my mind, The Broken Ear is also the last Tintin story that is fully representative, in both its drawing style and plotline, of the early adventures.  Looking at the art in The Broken Ear, one notices it bears a most striking resemblance to its immediate predecessors, notably The Blue Lotus and Cigars of the Pharaoh, whereas The Black Island - which immediately follows The Broken Ear - has a much greater similarity to the late adventures.  Of course this is due to the subsequent revision (and revision and revision, in some cases) of those stories - but it's still curious to note. <br /> <br />To sum up, The Broken Ear has all the right ingredients: humor, suspense, intrigue, peril (and plenty of it!).  To top it off, it features an ending in which the bad guys get what they deserve.  Nothing could ever be lovelier. <br /> <br />(The \\"grrrrreat grrrrreedy-guts!\\" of the headline refers to a line often uttered in The Broken Ear by a parrot, who plays a crucial role in this story.) <br /> <br />	2005-04-21

Picking up where its predecessor Cigars of the Pharaoh left off, The Blue Lotus (the fifth installment in the Adventures of Tintin series) chronicles boy reporter Tintin's adventures in Shanghai.  It is notable for many reasons, particularly in that it introduces the character of Tintin's Chinese friend, Chang Chong-Chen, who is to figure prominently in an installment of the series much later on. <br /> <br />Masterfully drawn and beautifully suspenseful as always, The Blue Lotus is arguably the most chilling of the Tintin stories.  He and Snowy seem to be in more peril here than in any other story with the possible exception of Tintin in America (the threat of their heads being chopped off rears its, uh, head more than once).  Possibly not a bedtime story, this one, but it's a fantastic read. <br /> <br />There are two more notable things unique to this story.  First of all, readers will most likely notice that Herge re-drew the first few pages (most likely to jive with the ending of Cigars of the Pharaoh, which had also been redone), and that Tintin undergoes a conspicuous metamorphosis from his later-edition, cuter self into an earlier, rounder-headed, pinprick-eyed version.  Second, this story features Thomson and Thompson in Shanghai what they believe to be local street wear, and if for no other reason, one should peruse The Blue Lotus just for those few panels! <br />	2005-04-20

If you are a political correctitude sort of person, you will likely find Tintin in America to be lacking in that area as well, but it is important to remember that it is a story steeped in its time, and more importantly, fictional. <br /> <br />What Tintin in America lacks in the indefinable quality some of the later adventures possess (The Calculus Affair, The Castafiore Emerald, and Flight 714, to name a few), it makes up in its suspense factor.  Danger looms around every corner in this story (Gangsters! Indians! A meat-canning factory!), and it doesn't matter how many times you've read it before -- you will still need to get through the entire story each time you read it! <br /> <br />To sum up: Somewhat awkwardly composed, and rife with stereotypes that seem ridiculous nowadays, Tintin in America is nevertheless a compelling and fun read.  It is, after all, a Tintin book.	2005-04-20

Besides possessing the perfunctory Tintin suspense and drama, this story marks the debut of the Thompson twins (les Duponts in the original French) and the nefarious Rastapopoulos, billionaire, movie tycoon, and ... well, y'know, general evildoer guy. <br /> <br />Unique to this adventure is Dr. Sophocles Sarcophagus, the somewhat sanity-deficient Egyptologist whom Tintin encounters on a ship at the beginning of this story.  This character is a textbook example of Herge's wonderful background characters, who proliferate in nearly every Tintin tale (the most notable exception being Tintin in Tibet, but I digress).  A wonderfully memorable scene in Cigars of the Pharaoh is that in which Tintin learns to converse with elephants.  The ending is something of a cliffhanger, causing the suitably hooked reader to experience an almost maniacal need to get his/her hands on The Blue Lotus! <br /> <br />A final comment: it is interesting to note that in redoing this story long after the completion of its original version, Herge has included a reference on page 1 to Marlinspike (Captain Haddock's family estate; Haddock and the house did not appear in the series until the later adventures The Crab With The Golden Claws and Red Rackham's Treasure).  It's unlikely that Herge neglected to realize the continuity problem, but is this simply an indication of his having a bit of fun? Who knows?  It's curious, anyway!  <br /> <br />	2005-04-20

She is the master of the absurd, quasi-fairy-tale young adult novel.  The Princess Diaries (by which I mean its sequels, too) are absolutely fantastic; ditto All-American Girl.  So naturally I had very high hopes for Teen Idol.  Surprisingly, however, I didn't find it nearly as satisfying a read.    The plot revolves around high school junior Jenny Greenley, \\"everybody's best friend,\\" who is so good at keeping secrets that she has been appointed the school's undercover advice columnist.  So when Luke Striker, Hollywood teenybopper heartthrob, comes to Jenny's small town school to research a role (undercover stuff, again), naturally it's Jenny the faculty calls upon to be Striker's chaperone.  Wackiness, of course, ensues.    Although the story is perfectly entertaining (especially the scenes dealing with Jenny's choir director, Mr. Hall, \\"who used to be on Broadway, but now taught a high-school choir in southern Indiana\\"), I thought there were a lot of areas where it fell short.  The characters didn't seem three-dimensional; they seemed more like names than people.  There was no immediate sense of personality such as is found in Ms. Cabot's other books.  The ending was a good one for the story, but I hadn't found myself rooting for anyone in particular, so really it was neither here nor there.    On the plus side, the writing is funny as always, and the lessons learned here are worth learning if one needs to learn them.  Jenny's transformation of an underling classmate and their subsequent friendship is a touching subplot.  But if you're looking for an absolutely wonderful young adult read, go straight to The Princess Diaries, or All-American Girl.  Ms. Cabot has a lot going for her.	2005-03-17

I thought it was just another nondescript young adult book with nothing about it to set it apart from any other.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised.  It is a fun and engrossing read. <br /> <br />Author Ann Brashares tells the story from four alternating points of view.  Unlike the majority of young adult novels, this one is told in third person, but it is the sort of third-person narrative that makes the reader think it's written in first-person (which I mean as a compliment in this case; it showcases each girl's personality beautifully).  The stories all take place over the course of the same summer and revolve around best-buds Lena, Bridget, Carmen and Tibby.  Lena, the introverted beauty of the group, goes to Greece with her sister to visit relatives, and tries to resist falling in love.  Carmen (\\"the one with the temper\\") goes to South Carolina to visit her father and finds - much to her surprise - she's about to gain a stepfamily.  Bridget, the athlete, falls in love/lust with a hot counselor at summer camp, and Tibby, the rebel, finds an unexpected friendship while working in minimum-wage drugstore hell. <br /> <br />Though at times the characters seem as though they're going to be two-dimensional (the pretty girl! the sporty girl!) they remain 3-D throughout, never crossing the border into caricature.  All four stories are captivating, though I personally found Tibby's and Bridget's to be the most interesting.  Evidently there are two sequels to The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, and I can't wait to read them.	2005-03-17

This is partially due to Remy, its hard-edged, (seemingly) cold protagonist (unusual for Sarah Dessen!); partially due to the utterly loveable character of Dexter; and partially due to many, many other factors.  Most of all it's  just due to the fact that it's a damn good book. <br /> <br />Every single one of This Lullaby's characters is interesting and multi-dimensional, even the most peripheral of players.  Although the story is a decidedly dramatic one, humor runs more rampant here than in any other Dessen novel, particularly in the subplots involving Remy's endearing ex-stoner brother, Chris, and his \\"self-improvement guru\\" girlfriend, Jennifer Anne. <br /> <br />This Lullaby is notable for me personally for being the only book I have ever bought without reading it first.  I had no idea what it was I was purchasing (well, okay, I'd read a couple of the author's other books and liked them, but you just never know).  Fortunately, it's turned out to be one of my two favorite books of all time (alongside The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy; go figure).   <br /> <br />All of Ms. Dessen's books are fun to read (particularly her first book, That Summer), but This Lullaby stands unique.	2005-01-16

With those first few words you are instantly pulled into the chaotic world of Dessen's gangly fifteen-year-old protagonist, Haven, whose summer revolves around two weddings: her father's, to the pulchritudinous local weather girl; and her sister Ashley's, to reliable-but-dull Lewis Warsher.  The former wedding is something Haven is struggling to come to terms with.  The latter she is flat-out dreading.  Add to this the fact that her recently divorced mother's life is seemingly being taken over by her new bosom buddy, Lydia; and on top of it all Haven has to work a thoroughly hateable job at a children's shoe store. <br /> <br />Enter (or rather re-enter) Sumner Lee.  Sumner is an ex-boyfriend of Ashley's whom Haven has clearly always idolized.  It's not too hard to see why - he is a loveably idiosyncratic, wonderfully written character.  Haven always associates him with a beloved summer several years past (hence the title) when he accompanied her then-undivorced family on a trip to Virginia Beach, and when he re-enters her life this year, on a break from college, she naturally sees it as a sign.  She wonders if there is some way she can get Sumner back together with Ashley, certain that as long as he is around everything will be all right. <br /> <br />I don't want to give away too much more of the plot, because this one simply must be read.  It is well worth purchasing sight unseen, because once the reader gets into it they will never want to put it down.  In my opinion this is possibly the best of Dessen's six novels (I say \\"possibly\\" because 2002's \\"This Lullaby\\" certainly gives it a good run for the money).  That Summer is endearing, charming, moving, sad, and funny all at once -- no mean feat. <br /> <br />	2005-01-16

Patty Dann's novel did not disappoint, to say the least.  It is one of the most gripping and involving novels I've read.  The voice of the narrator, fourteen-year-old Charlotte, is consistently funny and moving - sometimes both at once. <br /> <br />The supporting characters - most notably that of Charlotte's unforgettable mother, Mrs. Flax (she even refers to her as such, thus never allowing the reader to forget the distance between them) - are extremely well developed as well, and readers will be able to vividly see each character as though they know them personally.  The ending is just right too - not too light and not too melodramatic, though it easily could have swung to the latter.  Well done, Ms. Dann! <br /> <br />As far as how the book compares to the movie: the film is a bit of a lighter romp, and nothing is quite as fleshed out as in this book (remarkable, really, since the book isn't even 150 pages, but I'm digressing here).  In short, the film may be more \\"fun\\" at times, but the book has just as much going for it if not more.  If you're looking for a good and memorable read, Patty Dann's \\"Mermaids\\" is the ticket.	2004-11-26

It is one of the most captivating, engrossing books I've read - and a young adult novel, no less.   <br /> <br />On the surface, nothing about the story looks to have any particular distinction from the hordes of other YA novels out there - the quiet, \\"boring\\" girl is the central character; her popular, interesting best friend is the main supporting character; the former's parents don't understand her; she has a crush on a rebel-without-a-cause-type, etc., etc.  Add a teen pregnancy and token tertiary cheerleader characters to boot.   <br /> <br />Yet there is something different about this story, and I've been trying for some time to put my finger on what it is.  I think it lies in the voice that narrates it.  Halley, despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that she is not especially unusual, is immediately sympathetic.  Readers are going to want to know what happens to her, and to her friend Scarlett, and everyone else in the story.   <br /> <br />As with all the Dessen books I've read, there is a well-developed cast of supporting characters - one of the most notable being Halley's mother, Julie, a child psychologist who doesn't know how to deal with her own daughter.  The story of their bond and how it metamorphoses over time is one of the most interesting secondary themes in this story, as is that of the relationship between Halley and her aforementioned love interest, Macon Faulkner. <br /> <br />As the story continues and readers find themselves pulled in (and they will!), one finds oneself wishing more and more - although perhaps subconsciously - that they had Halley for a best friend.	2004-11-25

Megan McCafferty's \\"Second Helpings,\\" the latter half of the Jessica Darling duology (is that a word?), gripped me in an unexpected way.  I got the book out of the library in order to see what Macmillan was publishing and upon cracking it open was less than enthralled - typical YA fare, I thought.  High school hierarchy, boyfriend troubles, and a rich variety of sexual practices.  As McCafferty's heroine might say, whoop-freakin'-de-doo. <br /> <br />But the bizarre thing was, I found myself oddly engrossed by the sarcastic voice telling the story.  It was so annoying it was transfixing.  Before long I had read the whole book and still find myself dipping into it again and again (as of this writing, I have to return it in five days).  Though the stuff the tale is made of is irritatingly familiar and occasionally stupid, the way Jessica narrates the story is believable and usually intelligent - and this is the book's greatest strength. <br />	2004-10-14
US	37791650	R8I7LSNA5KWX8	0375705198	314955975	Amy and Isabelle: A novel	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Many thoughts	Elizabeth Strout's novel \\"Amy and Isabelle\\" is beguilingly complicated, or complicatedly beguiling - I'm not sure which.  Either way, it's gripping stuff.  Taking place one summer in Maine, the story revolves around the relationship between fifteen-year-old Amy Goodrow and her repressed mother, Isabelle, who is hiding a secret.  Given the course of the story, said secret will more than likely become manifest well before Strout actually states it outright.  (Though more than likely you will want to read the whole thing through anyway.) <br /> <br />Without a doubt the book's greatest asset is the strength of the characters.  Everybody, even the most peripheral of players, is three-dimensional.  Although of course Isabelle and Amy are the primary focus of the tale, there are a few  secondary characters who figure almost as prominently - most notably Mr. Robertson, the slimy math teacher with whom Amy becomes inappropriately involved; Stacy Burrows, Amy's troubled friend who becomes pregnant; and Avery Clark, Isabelle's boss, with whom she is secretly besotted.  All of these characters and numerous others are multi-faceted and often riveting. <br /> <br />The book's greatest weakness is in its lack of humor.  This may seem a rather preposterous comment given its decidedly unhumorous subject matter, but I mean it in a very subtle sense.  Very often the tone of the story is intensely harrowing and maudlin, and one might well find oneself wondering if Strout could have found anyplace where it was possible to lighten things.  She is obviously not without humor.  (Take for example one scene early in the book, when Amy is angry at Mr. Robertson and writes something nasty but undisclosed about him on the wall of the school restroom.  The ending sentence of this paragraph made me snicker out loud.) There are more than one of these instances, but they are too few and too brief - in my opinion, at any rate. <br /> <br />Overall, I found this a gripping story with a lot going forit, but not necessarily one I would put myself through more than once or twice.  Perhaps this in itself is a testament to Strout's abilities as a writer - she really makes you go through everything the characters are going through right along with them. <br /> <br />	2004-10-13

Although its plot mainly revolves around Princess Mia's aching desire to go to the prom (though boyfriend Michael thinks proms are lame), there are several memorable subplots as well, several of them hilarious.  The hideously wonderful (or wonderfully hideous, perhaps) Grandmere is back, of course, as are all the rest of the Princess Diaries supporting cast readers know and love -- for example, Mia's best friend, Lilly Moscovitz, wreaking havoc with her TV show and her intelligence as usual.  (Later, she finds herself in the midst of romantic turmoil thanks to her indiscretions with a hot busboy.)<br />Near the end of the book, the long-awaited birth of Mia's baby brother or sister (I'm not saying which.  You'll have to read it!) finally occurs.  Earlier in the book, so does Mia's fifteenth birthday - a momentous event in her life, particularly because she comes away from it with a cell phone.  A highlight of the book, as always, are the funny and just-slightly-sarcastic lists Mia occasionally makes (this time of Lifetime movies with unrealistically heroic protagonists).<br />One would think that after four (and a half) Princess Diaries installments, this series would start to get stale, but it never does.	2004-05-12

From the first page, you are intrigued by its protagonist and supporting cast, and you want to read on and on to know what's going to become of them - preferably all in one sitting.<br />The story's protagonist and narrator is Tilden, an intelligent and insightful girl.  Upon first reading the book I missed Tilden's age at first and was sure we were hearing the narration of a seventeen (or so) year old - or even an adult in a flashback, perhaps - but the more I read, the more references I saw to the fact that she was much younger (i.e. the fact that all the girls in her class have to watch a movie about menstruation, etc.).  Tilden and her younger (by a year) sister, Elizabeth - also a memorable character - are two of the four main characters in the book.  The others are their mother, Frances (a.k.a. \\"Mama\\"), and her new boyfriend and eventual husband, Nick, to whose home she moves the girls at the beginning of the story.<br />The well-written story is often wrenchingly painful and even a bit disturbing to read, as it deals not only with the girls' mother's battle with cancer but also with other unhappy issues (i.e. preteen sex; a predatory uncle) throughout.  Still, it is such a gripping story that it makes reading it all worthwhile.	2004-05-09

It chronicles the turbulent adolescence of the idiosyncratic Adrian through the time he turns fifteen.  There are highlights consistently throughout the story, such as his submissions of poetry to the BBC (and the letters he consequently receives in return), his romance with the memorable Pandora Braithwaite, and his occasional references to a magazine called &quot;Big &amp; Bouncy&quot; which he keeps hidden under his mattress.<br />Author Sue Townsend's writing is entertaining and funny throughout, and this book is a welcome change from the plethora of &quot;teen diaries&quot; that seem to dominate every library and bookstore's young adult section.	2004-05-08

Only just last month did I finally read it!<br />Lisa, Bright and Dark is a well-written and thoroughly gripping read.  It chronicles the story of sixteen-year-old high schooler Lisa Schilling's descent into mental illness.  Although Lisa's mother and father and teachers are inclined to ignore her, her trio of girlfriends recognize that something is wrong with her and decide to help her out.  After learning everything they can about schizophrenia and other various mental disorders, the girls meet with Lisa for a series of amateur psychiatric sessions.  Although of course they cannot give her all the help she needs, their determination to save her is touching and will likely make the reader wish he/she had those same friends.<br />Set in the sixties (and originally published in 1969), the tale is narrated by Betsy Goodman, the most reserved and sideline-sitting of the three girls.  This was, in my opinion, an interesting and well made choice on author John Neufeld's part, for as a result we get to learn things about the character of Betsy that we would not have been able to know otherwise.  I have seen some reviews of this book where the reviewer complains that it seems antiquated (i.e. the girls' use of the word \\"groovy,\\" Betsy's lusting after Paul Newman, etc.).  I personally didn't find this bothersome at all.  Instead I thought it had the effect of making the book seem like a period piece, not unlike the movie \\"Mermaids\\" - and also like that movie, the majority of its qualities are indisputably timeless.	2004-05-07

Each revolves around a long-concealed secret, and most are entertaining, though the overall tone of the book does tend to lean toward the morbid - or at least unpleasant.<br />The book was edited by author Lisa Rowe Frautino, who also penned its well-written but sometimes very disturbing story, \\"FRESh PAINt\\".  A couple other stories of note are \\"The Secret of Life, According to Aunt Gladys\\" by Bruce Coville (\\"Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher\\"), \\"I Will Not Think of Maine\\" by M.E. Kerr, and \\"Rice Pudding Days\\" by Susan Campbell Bartoletti.<br />To sum up: I personally am not a fan of unhappy stories, especially so many in one place, but this is still a high-quality book which makes for interesting and often mysterious reading.  Still, I would not recommend it to anyone under 14 or so -- for a younger person looking for a short story anthology, I would recommend \\"13: Thirteen stories that celebrate the agony and ecstasy of being thirteen\\" (which incidentally also features an entertaining story by the aforementioned Coville).	2004-05-05

Although some stories focus less on actually being thirteen than they do on simply revolving around a 13-year-old character, it doesn't matter - it's still a wholly entertaining read.  A few stories of note:<br />\\"What's The Worst That Could Happen\\" by Bruce Coville - a funny but mostly painful tale of embarrassment that is bound to make the reader squirm at least once or twice.<br />\\"Squid Girl\\" by Todd Strasser - a fascinating (and very funny) story about a girl who meets a boy while on vacation, told from an idiosyncratic second-person point of view.<br />\\"Noodle Soup for Nincompoops\\" by Ellen Wittlinger - the story of a shy sideline-sitter who is able to express herself for the first time in the kooky guise of an anonymous advice columnist for her school paper.<br />Other popular authors whose pieces are included in this compendium include Meg Cabot (\\"The Princess Diaries,\\" \\"All-American Girl,\\" etc.), Ann M. Martin (\\"The Baby-Sitters Club\\" series, etc.), and James Howe (\\"Bunnicula,\\" etc.) who also served as editor for this collection.  I personally think this book will be enjoyed by readers of all ages - those who have already been thirteen, those who are not thirteen yet, and those who are thirteen right now.	2004-04-04

The story is alternatingly told from the points of view of all five girls in the group, which was a wise decision on Ms. Koss's part as it allows us to develop a varying amounts of sympathy for all the characters, even the meanest ones.<br />One of the most sympathetic figures here is Maya Koptiev, who at at the outset of the story has been the most recent one to be ostracized from the group.  The ostracization of Maya (and others, as the tale progresses) is initiated by the clique's ringleader, Candace Newman.  Nasty, gutsy, charismatic, and possessing the power to make everyone around kowtow to her, Candace is altogether too believable a character - as is her ugly-acting sidekick, Darcy.  Yet at the same time, both girls' characters are three-dimensional.  You might want to hate them, but you can't.<br />Rounding out the group are weak-willed Brianna, who wants to remain friends with the excluded Maya but can't quite manage to wriggle out of Candace's proverbial clutches; and shy Renee, who dithers her way through sentences and worries about her father, the \\"jukebox man\\".  Also prevalent are supporting players Keloryn (Darcy's college-bound older sister) and Nicole (a redhead Candace adopts for what Brianna refers to as her \\"girl collection\\").<br />At 121 pages, \\"The Girls\\" is a short novel, but everything is there that needs to be.  It is an (unfortunately) accurate and very compelling story from beginning to end.	2004-03-07

Hardly any time was spent on this in the film, which in my opinion was rather disappointing (although the film did have Colin Firth).<br />You'll want to know what's going to happen with Bridget and everyone else, and you'll be surprised how difficult it is to put this book down!	2004-02-12

It is just as good as the first three books, if not better.  I hesitate to give away too much of the plot (it's best read for yourself) but I think I can let slip this much: the story takes place directly following book #3, Princess In Love. <br />Princess In Waiting is chock-full of the aforementioned Cabot humor - sarcastic and guaranteed to make you laugh out loud at least once or twice during the book.	2003-10-28

It is sad, touching, funny, moving, and sarcastic all at once (sometimes even in the same sentence).  It is almost impossible to believe that author Lori Gottlieb was only eleven when she wrote the diaries that make up the book.<br />Ms. Gottlieb's story chronicles the journey of her healthy pre-teen self as she falls deeper and deeper into the clutches of anorexia, eventually landing herself in the hospital.  Although of course only she herself brought on her eating disorder, one cannot help but surmise that those around her had a lot to do with it as well - it quickly becomes manifest that she was surrounded by a menagerie of extremely shallow and dysfunctional relatives and &quot;friends,&quot; not to mention the image-obsessed media.  (The influence of said menagerie is perhaps never more readily obvious than in Ms. Gottlieb's entry &quot;I wish...to be the thinnest eleven-year-old on the entire planet.  I mean, what are girls supposed to wish for, other than being thin?&quot;)<br />At some point during the first entry, Ms. Gottlieb comments on how the adults around her always describe her as &quot;unique,&quot; meaning it in a way that is not altogether complimentary.  When I say that this is a unique book written by a unique person, I mean it in the absolute highest regard.	2003-10-26

Although on first glance the books might look like any other teenage drivel (i.e. the \\"Love Stories\\" or anything with the words \\"Sweet Valley\\" on the cover), they are far from it.

Like all the others, it encompasses several different plots.  Although all the plots are believable and most are interesting, not all of the characters are likeable and some, like egocentric football player Jesse Jones, are downright loathsome.  (On a note not directly related to this book, one has to wonder why Melanie Andrews - easily the best, most multi-dimensional character in the series - has such an emotional investment in him for so long).  <br />Although all the books have the aforementioned cliffhanger endings, this one in particular has an ending that should leave the reader desperate to find out what happens next.	2003-10-02

Even the conversations are repeated, word for word.  <br />What I think would have been more interesting is a book told from the characters' points of view (and why not the guys, too?) that encompassed material not already covered in the series.  It might have been interesting, for example, to read a first-person account of what happened after the Clearwater Crossing series ended - Leah at Stanford, Melanie as a junior, etc.<br />On its own, \\"The Diaries\\" is a good book, but I would recommend just reading the first four books, because they are better.	2003-10-02

The story centers on twelve-year-old Shelby Graham, who takes a vacation every summer with her immediate family and her aunt, uncle and cousins at an Oregon beach cottage called Sea Haven. Although Shelby does deal with the aforementioned, oft-written-about adolescent issues, author Linda Crew has managed to chronicle her heroine's summer in such a way as to make the topics seem like unchartered ground.

I have been a fan of Herg&eacute;'s Adventures of Tintin since I was three years old, and \\"Tintin in Tibet\\" is without a doubt one of the four best.  It combines wonderful art and a touching story, plus the return of Tintin's friend Chang, whom we have not seen since the earlier story \\"The Blue Lotus\\".  (The other three best Tintin stories, in my opinion are \\"The Castafiore Emerald,\\" \\"The Calculus Affair\\" and \\"Flight 714\\".  I recommend you check them all out.) Enjoy.	2003-02-08

PRINCESS IN LOVE, the third book in the Princess Diaries series is, in my opinion, even better than the first two. I don't want to spoil any of it, but I guarantee that if you read it you will love it. The best part is that I thought the series was going to be a trilogy. I thought after this one it was over - and it turns out there's going to be a TPD #4! I can't wait. :-)	2003-01-25

Not so with this one! It is just as entertaining as the first. I hesitate to spoil it (it's best to read it for yourself) but I'll just say this: it is hilarious and touching all at once. And as soon as you're finished with it, you'll want to get Vol. 3 (\\"Princess In Love\\" - perhaps the best in the series) and see what happens to Princess Mia next.  I can't wait for Vol. 4!	2003-01-25
