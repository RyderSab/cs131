US	52872993	RB355TK023SYX	1894965108	29318946	The Lost Thing	Books	5	39	40	N	N	Simply wonderful	It is difficult to classify this superb book.  It is classified as a children's book, but it will have appeal to all ages.  To a certain extent it reminds me of the great works of art by Graeme Base and John Sceszka and Lane Smith, but again it is different.  The imagies are almost surreal - certainly reminiscent of Dali on an odd day.<br /><br />A simple tale, without a moral?  Perhaps so, perhaps not - I like to think it is a comment on all we have lost, and found, and let go again.<br /><br />The illustrations are magnificent, quirky and engaging, and you notice different things with each reading (or viewing?).  Our hero is a simple soul, the lost thing also simple and yet remarkably complex.  My favourite part is where our hero gives it something to eat once he has discovered what it likes, and the food he is offering it is christmas decorations!<br /><br />It is an absolutely delightful book.  Share it with your children, or your partner, or your best friend.  Or keep it for yourself.  It isn't a book that is easy to classify, but it is definitely a keeper.<br /><br />I recommend it highly.	2005-08-06

This is a fairly standard romance set in the \\"romantic\\" coal fields of Northern Wales.  The 3 main characters are linked either by blood  common passion, and this should make for a more interesting story, but alas, it is entirely predictible.<br /><br />What is of interest is that in my copy, Dot's father has a mistress called Edie, and thus she is called for at least two thirds of the book, when she is suddenly referred to as Blanche.  I had to re-read a few pages to ensure that she was indeed one and the same character.  Poor editing perhaps?  Either way, it doesn't make the book any more interesting.<br /><br />It is certainly an entertaining enough read for lovers of the genre, but if you're looking for a far more spectacular book on the life and times of the hardy and brave men who worked the mines, and the women who loved them, try \\"How Green Was My Valley\\" by Richard Llewellyn.	2005-04-18

From here there is a journey of emotions - first to return the photograph to its original owner, and secondly for the primary character to unravel some of the mystery of his father's past.<br /><br />A very interesting start to a novel, but somehow in attempting to make comment on a divided Germany and how people lived in the East and West, it misses a beat.  There are no strong observations one way or another, and even the family mystery is easily guessed.<br /><br />Overall I found this novel quite disappointing.  It could have been quite something, dealing as it does with a period of history that is barely touched by western novels, but it falls short.  It is neither a great mystery or a great historical novel, but it could have been both.	2005-04-03

And so I started this book with a great deal of anticipation.<br /><br />I was disappointed.  Sure it is an enjoyable read, in a rip-roaring \\"boy's own adventure\\" mould.  The character is well drawn, and I thought the flash backs where we learn of how he becomes a werewolf were very well done - in fact the story would have been much stronger had it delved more into the lives of his pack, because these characters are by far the most interesting.<br /><br />What I ultimately found disappointing was the engagement with the Nazis.  I found the bad guys somewhat trite (when I feel they always should be THE most interesting characters in a novel), and some of the action scenes so unexciting that I found myself skimming through the pages - never a good thing for an action novel.<br /><br />So, yes it was entertaining, and yes I enjoyed it, but...... Mr McCammon can do MUCH better, and has on nearly every other occasion.	2005-03-22
US	52872993	R30HPVQTXX9DJF	0755304047	621000408	Passion	Books	3	23	25	N	N	Interesting and sometimes compelling	This is a very good novel about the great poets of the Regency years - Byron, Shelley and Keats, and told from a very different perspective - that of the women from different walks of life and social standings, and who loved them.  Some are quite famous in their own right (we have \\"Frankenstein\\" thanks to Mary Shelley), some, like Lady Caroline Lamb were considered quite scandalous, others lived far less prominent lives.<br /><br />However, it is not a novel without flaws.  There is quite a bit of focus on Fanny Brawne, who loved Keats, and yet that great poet doesn't enter the picture till quite late in the novel, and only briefly.  Sometimes the novel can be seen as a little disjointed - some chapters chop and change between the characters and you have read some way before you realise who we are reading about.<br /><br />And yet there are times when it is a beautiful book, and you feel quite drawn into the loves and lives of these beautiful and ultimately doomed people.<br /><br />This is not a romantic novel by any stretch of the imagination, and indeed it seems there was very little romance in the loves of these great poets.  But they certainly had strong women, and it is these women, and how they coped with the places in history, that makes it a good read.<br /><br />As a spin off, it would be good to have a volume of poetry handy - I found that I wanted to look at Byron's \\"Childe Harold\\" on more than one occasion!	2005-01-25

There are no nasty shock tactics, no gruesome depictions of gore, and no hideous monsters waiting in dark corners.  There is just a magnificent modern and newly built house, which in its own quiet way wreaks havoc on the lives of its unfortunate 3 successive owners, and in turn, the peaceful and prosperous neighbourhood in which it is built.<br /><br />What is clever in this novel is the introduction of things that are happening in our society, including some quite horrific things, which are frequently and quietly ignored if not accepted.  This forms an eerie basis for the things that are to come.  The unnatural closeness of a father and his daughter; the spectre of the loss of a child and the resultant mental illness; the suggestion of domestic violence.  The author weaves these themes cleverly into the occupants of the house next door, and you just know that some further bad things are going to happen.<br /><br />At its best level this book is a psychological chiller.  The families involved clearly have issues and unfortunate lives - are the things that happen to them simply further misfortunes?  Are the caring neighbours who begin to recognise the growing menace that the house next door represents themselves slipping into paranoia and their own mental illness?  It is a very clever book - very clever indeed.<br /><br />This is a book that will stay with you for a long time.  I find myself considering its themes of quiet madness in leafy suburbia, intertwined with the great gothic themes of a haunted house, and I think that it is one of the best books I have read in ages, and one that I recommend highly.	2005-01-17

It looks at a time in history where there was still enormous class distinction, and among the \\"upper class\\" there was scandal galore.  And among the best of them was the Comte D'Orsay, handsome and witty Frenchman, who scandalised society with his wit, bisexuality and flagrant affiars with Lady Blessington, one of the beauties of her age.<br /><br />But this is not just a flippant story of a great scandal.  Amongst D'Orsay's comtemporaries were Byron, Beau Brummel, the Bourbon Kings of Europe, and the descendents of Napoleon.  These were interestng times, when Europe as a whole was deciding her fate.  There are enough interesting snippets of greater history to make this book worth reading.  But it is the letters and journals that make this book come alive.<br /><br />This is a time in history that I was not particularly familiar with, and to view it through the eyes of these flamboyant and wealthy characters, give it an interest and piquancy that nothing else could.	2004-12-29

The future world depicted in \\"The Second Angel\\" is one of the most finely detailed visions of what is to come that I have encountered in a novel of this type for some time.  The attention to detail is wonderful, and the explanation of climate change, the nature of the virus that has most of the world ostracised from the privaleged healthy people and the world they occupy, is very fine.  However, it is the story that is set in this detailed world that is sorely lacking.<br /><br />Our hero is driven by revenge against the company that has killed his wife and child, after he is percieved as a risk to the company's greater good.  This is always an excellent premise for a thriller such as this, but the characterisations are so poor, that we are barely aware that he has a family, and it requires a great stretch of faith to believe that he has such passions as to be aroused by this dreadful act.  Like so many novels with poor characterisations, it is the bad guy, the psychopathic head of security who is by far the most interesting character, and even then we get only a glimpse of what makes him tick.<br /><br />Finally the story itself gets very bogged down by the convoluted turns the story takes when he is breaking into the blood bank on the moon, and whereas this should have been exciting, it was most unsatisfactory, even tedious, and the ending itself was abrupt, almost as if the author had no idea how to end it.<br /><br />I have given this 2 stars as it is a novel that could have been truly great; however it seems that the author could not adequately populate the stunning world he had created.	2004-12-06

Salley Vickers' story of Mr Golightly's holiday is a gentle and clever book which allows us all to consider the nature of faith and how God may view the complicated every day lives that we all lead.  The characters are interesting (if a little pallid) in their routine kinds of lives; the village is believable, and if you don't know the key to the story you can have a bit of fun trying to work out who Mr Golightly is, what is his business, and why has he lost his only son (not really too difficult to work out).<br /><br />However, it is that very gentle cleverness that means that this book is somewhat slow at times, and in places I felt this rather hard going.  I also felt the ending somewhat contrived, almost as if Ms Vickers wasn't sure how to finish the book.<br /><br />It is certainly an entertaining read, and a good story, but I feel that it fell somewhat short of its potential.  I feel that Ms Vickers' undoubted writing talents are better portrayed in \\"Miss Garnet's Angel\\", which is a far superior book.	2004-10-14

And this is rich fodder for some really great story telling.  Of course the Magna Carta is discussed in context, and written in its entirety at the back of the book (the first time I have read it), but it is the story of how it came to be that is the real meat in this fabulous book.<br /><br />First we have the Plantagenets, and what a fascinating family they were.  John was on the throne in 1215, but his mother, father, and assorted siblings were among the most interesting people English history have to offer.  The entire family provided the greatest soap opera scripts ever written!<br /><br />Then we have the local aristocracy.  Driven by John's fickle nature (and who could blame him with such a family!) they were faithful, faithess, loyal and treacherous all, some all at once.<br /><br />And then we have the local times themselves.  There are chapters on the church, justice and how the everyday people lived their lives.  The aristocracy lived exceptionally well of course, perhaps better than we in the 21st century realise.<br /><br />All in all this is an absolutely fascinating snapshot of an interesting year in a turbulent time.  And it is even more interesting to speculate how events so long ago impact on the way we live our lives today.  This is a great book - entertaining, thoughtful and fascinating.  What more could you ask?	2004-10-06

I was given this book by a friend who could not believe that a book obsessive like me had read nothing by Elizabeth George.  I'm glad she did - I found it entertaining, and I have to confess that I didn't truly figure out who was the murderer until Ms George was ready to let me know.  I had my suspicions of course, but they were vague, and there were all those great red herrings thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />What I found most unsatisfying was that there were a number of behaviours of the murdered man that led to suspects aplenty, but in the end there was no explanation at all for some of his more bizarre behaviours.  There is a moment when his sister realises, but alas it is not shared with the reader.  This could have been a truly fantastic novel if all of these loose ends were resolved to everyone's satisfaction and understanding.<br /><br />Similarly the enticing subject of the German occupation and what it did to decent men and women is touched upon, but never really delved into. This could have given the novel a depth that it truly needed.<br /><br />Having said that, it kept me engrossed enough to finish, and I will certainly be trying others of this genre by Ms George.	2004-09-26

And this is surely scary enough, but it somehow misses out on the great promise that it isthe relationship between the young main characters.<br /><br />The story is intelligent enough, and in fact the entire concept of the scary show, in the field of horrors, in a quiet town is the stuff of truly great horror.  But this is more than that - it is a novel of friendship and the things that we can get ourselves into when we're not quite children, and not yet adults.<br /><br />Alas this really falls short.  If you want to read a novel which develops these friendships in a far superior manner, you cannot go by Stephen King's \\"It\\".  However, if you want a quick read, and a quick scare, then come visit the Travelling Vampire Show some time soon.	2004-08-19

I was disappointed.<br />Sure the book delivers all that it promises - fast paced action in the beautiful parts of the world, potentially evil terrorists (or playboys?), big terrorist attacks, sub plots and red herrings.  But somewhere along the way, I really began to find the book was quite hard going.  I think I just stopped being interested in, or caring about our hero Olivia.<br />It is certainly mildly entertaining, and as a smallish book it is a quick read, great for lying on a beach somewhere.  But I think it is also a great opportunity missed.  Perhaps it will translate better into a movie - this is a screenplay waiting in the wings.	2004-06-03

She is a very fine writer with excellent attention to detail and historical accuracy, as well the ability to make the characters come vividly alive.<br />This is of course a very fine and entertaining story. There is our heroine Katherine, with all of her trials and tribulations, and who finds herself unexpectedly thrust into a turbulent life with a turbulent royal family! It is interesting to note that through the children she had with John of Gaunt, she is a direct ancestress of all of ruling Kings and Queens of England from that time on (and a great many members of European royal families as well)! Katherine made her mark on history in many, many ways.<br />This is an utterly charming and beautiful book. I was about 12 when I first picked it up and was immediately enchanted by the writing, the adventure and the history, and return to it time and time again. The book is peppered with other interesting historical characters - for example Geoffrey Chaucer was married to Katherine's sister, and appears from time to time full of wit and stories.<br />So read it for yourself, and introduce it to a young lady in your life. You could not bestow a finer gift.	2004-05-22

She has had only one earlier visit there, and is not sure that she is terribly keen on the whole idea.<br />The entire book could be called &quot;The Trials and Tribulations of Sarah in a Foreign Land&quot; because this is essentially what it is.  Bored with her life and the absence of her man, who is frequently away covering assignments, Sarah investigates and embraces all sorts of different elements of Indian life and culture, sometimes seriously, and sometimes quite flippantly, but always with respect.<br />The outcome of this is usually very funny, and sometimes quite unbelievable.  I was given this book as a friend who knew of my desire to visit India (I have yet to do so) and at the beginning I was not sure I would ever go, by the middle I was quite entranced, and by the end I still would love to visit.<br />Sure this isn't a politically correct observation of another culture and the millions of people who live their lives in a country so completely different to our sanitised Western World, but it is entertaining, and it is certainly an eye-opener.	2004-05-10

For anyone interested in history - either of Europe on a grand scale or domestic life on a small scale, this is the book for you.

The story is simple enough - the main character prot (no capitalisations except for other planets!) claims to be from the planet K-Pax, but is he simply a mentally traumatised man called Robert?  This is a very clever book which has you thinking yes and no to both of these questions as you read along.<br />Another very clever plot devise is that the author writes in the first person, and refers to himself as the psychiatrist who is treating prot/Robert.  This is done with such skill and candour that you can almost get drawn into thinking that this is a true case study of a doctor who is relating the story of his most fascinating subject.  It is very, very clever.<br />Finally, it is also very uplifting.  Some of prot's observations and advice to his fellow psychiatric inmates changes their lives almost exclusively for the better - somewhat simplisticly sure, but hey, this is a novel for entertainment, and here it hits the mark very well.<br />I recommend it highly.	2004-03-14

And that critical gap is the entire story in itself.<br />This may seem a strange thing to say, as it is quite a hefty tome, but essentially very little happens in this book.  It is a love story indeed, but I feel that the elements of the main characters' love for each other are not well developed, and as other critics have observed seem to focus on their sex life.  I feel that given Henry's pre-disposition to disappear to other times, some of his adventures could have been a little more deeply explored, as could have Clare's interaction with friends and family as she waits for her unpredictable lover.  Particularly odd is how the very concepts of time travel are skimmed over - sometimes Henry meets his older/younger self; sometimes he remembers things/sometimes not, and there is never any real explanation for his sometimes bizarre and violent behaviour in some of his travels.<br />Perhaps the author wished to show the impact of this time travel on people struggling to maintain normal lives - alas this doesn't make for particularly thrilling reading.<br />Lastly, this is a really innovative book, and a brave attempt to cross the boundaries of romance and science fiction.  It is worth reading for these reasons, but I was disappointed.	2004-01-19
US	52872993	R34VSZW9MIUGXA	0440225108	7077895	The Plague Tales	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Had promise but misses something	This novel certainly has an interesting premise, comparing and linking the horrors of the medieval Black Death with the equally horrific prospect of the plague in the not too distant future.  But somehow I found that there was insiffient detail in each of the stories to really hold my attention.<br />The medieval story is by far the better tale, even though there are some small historical inaccuracies (for example, Alejandro our hero treats a patient early in the book with eucalyptus, which would be hard as this Australian plant didn't arrive in Europe until it was retrieved by explorers in the 1700s).  Alejandro is a character that we can identify with, a Spanish Jew who is fighting for his life and thirsting for knowledge.  But even so I felt that the characters who surrounded him were simply not well enough explored to allow us to really identify with the impact of the plague.  Geraldine Brooks manages this exceptionally well in her superb &quot;Year of Wonders&quot;.<br />As for the futuristic phase of the book, this is also interesting, but again there is insufficient character development to allow us to really sympathise with our far more modern hero Janie.  And there is really no real discussion of how a modern plague would impact on a society which is obsessed with keeping disease at bay.  In addition, the future is 2005, perhaps too soon for me to identify with this alternative future.  For the epitome of storytelling about the horrors of plague amongst modern times, you can't go past Stephen King's &quot;The Stand&quot;.<br />All in all its an entertaining read, and certainly Ms Benson is a talented writer, but I still feel something is missing.  Perhaps it was a little too ambitious.	2004-01-13

But the real richness of the book is in the fabulous characters that Sheri Holman gives us to sympathise with, get annoyed with, and ultimately feel some satisfaction with.<br />And they are great characters too.  There is poor Manda who finds herself in IVF hell.  There is Margaret, the somewhat eccentric cheese maker who clings to the old life and her somewhat prickly teenaged daughter Polly.  There is August the Jefferson devotee and his father the Pastor who somehow seems to be in the middle of all that drives the town and the people who live in it.  By the end of the book you feel as if you know these people quite well, and I find that it is this talent that makes me really enjoy a novel.<br />There have been some criticism of elements of this book, and it certainly isn't perfect, but it is a really lovely story, well written, and I am happy to recommend it.	2004-01-06

Descriptions of the times and early media interest are well done, but as the book progresses and the family sinks into tragedy, I feel the story loses some of its impact, and I struggled to finish the story.<br />This is not to say that the characters are unsympathetic, or that the reader cannot identify with their plight, but more that as they struggle to deal with their lives, interest in their lives begins to wane.<br />Sheri Holman's &quot;The Mammoth Cheese&quot; deals with a similar topic in modern times, but is by far the better book in my opinion.	2004-01-06

As well as the horror of the explosions, there were the bombs that did not detonate, and the brave men who literally risked their lives to defuse them.  This is their story.<br />It is a well written book, but has something of the British understatement in it - where the sheer horror of the deaths of these men is underplayed, and, in my opinion the celebration of their heroism is not made enough of.  There is one story of a man who waded through toxic mud seven times to defuse a bomb in a factory because dangerous gasses meant that he couldn't do it in one take.  He was awarded a medal for this, as were so many of his compatriates in similar circumstances, but somehow I felt that there was more to his story than what is listed here.  There are so many stories like this one - absolutely horrifying, really amazing brave stories, and whereas this is a touching and apt tribute, I think their tales need a book that shouts their stories from the roof tops.	2003-11-24

And of course I was aware that the Romanovs were quite a sprawling family, with lots of Grand Dukes and Duchesses, but I did not know a great deal about these individuals, who are all equally fascinating in their own right - and often even more so, as Nicholas and Alexandra enjoyed a quiet life.<br />The book commences with the assasination of Alexander II and the ascent to the throne of his son Alexander III.  From here we get to know of the young Nicki (later to be Tsar) and his other siblings, including Olga, who had a life of some hardship but did not complain until she died in her 80s.  The book covers the revoltion of course, but for those readers wanting to know more about that and the impact on the immediate royal family, I recommend Robert Massie's excellent \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\".  What I found of more interest was how the extended royal family fared, some being executed the Bolsheviks, some enduring amazing hardship and escapes, and others being saved by sheer luck.<br />The final part of the book deals with the remaining Romanovs in exile, and examines the interaction with the competing family groups and individuals who laid claim to the now empty throne.  These characters include Kyrill, who is the ancestor of George, the current claimant, and Dimitri, the ultimate playboy who had an affair with Coco Chanel and married an American heiress.<br />This book is a reminder of how revoltion and war can change the worlds of so many people, and how that change had spread and impacted through a Europe which was also in the throes of dramatic change.  We must remember that the Romanovs were descended from or connected by marriage to most of the other royal houses in Europe, and there were many political and dynastic implications of the fall of the Romanovs.    This is a fasinating story about fascinating people in a time when the world was turned upside down.	2003-10-23

James book that I have read and clearly I have been depriving myself of some very thrilling and cleverly constructed murder mysteries, which do more than keep the reader turning the pages.  This is a well constructed murder/mystery, with not just one death, but 4!  The book opens with the death of a young man training to be a priest in an isolated seminary on the rugged English coast.  Is it suicide?  Murder?<br />Despite a coroner's inquest, the super competent Inspector Dalgleish comes to investigate further, at the request of the man's father.  While there he beomes emborioled in the other deaths, only one of which is obviously murder, committed while he is staying at the seminary.  Are all of these deaths connected, and why would anyone want all of these people dead?<br />This is a really complex story, with nearly all of the characters having some reason to either hate the murdered man, or reason to implicate someone else.  I didn't guess who the murderer was until the author wanted me to, and I think that this is fantastic in really good murder mysteries (I hate working out who did it in too short a period of time).<br />The reason I have given this fine book 4 stars (well, really 4.5) is that I wasn't really convinced with the motive for the murder when it was finally solved.  I guess it was plausible, but nowhere as strong as I had expected.  As for the other deaths, well you'll have to read the book to work it out!  It is well worth reading, and I shall find more of Ms Jame's books to devour!	2003-10-20

Our heroine is appropriately fesity, the settings well drawn, and the other characters who populate her world are interesting and believable.  But what makes this story so different, and really quite entertaining, is that it is really a tale of suffering and redemption following the French Revolution, but in a different world and time.  Following this, everything that Eliste knows and holds to be true is swept away in fear and violence, and her struggle to survive in this changing world is the centrepiece of the book.<br />Eliste's world is not France of course, and the King and Queen are not Louis and Marie Antoinette, but they may as well be (though they have no children).  The strict formalities that surrounded the French Court are faithfully related here, and you come to believe in this society where the Exalted lived just as the aristocracy did in France.  Anyone who is familiar with the French Revolution will find this very clever - the reader can indulge in a game of &quot;find the characters&quot; - Marat for instance, who spent most of his time in a bath due to an unpleasant skin condition, is transformed into the beggar leader Fungus (who as the name suggests has an equally unpleasant skin condition).  Even the guillotine is transformed into something far more nasty - a machine called Kokette with enormous spikes and needs of its own!<br />Interspersed with all this is some magic, some terrible hardship (the author does not shirk from some rather graphic descriptions of hardship and deprivation), and of course love.  Eliste travels a rocky road from a spoilt young lady to a woman with rather formiddable skills and fortitude.<br />This is a different, clever and entertaining book.  It is quite long, but thankfully keeps your attention for the whole time.  I recommend it highly for people who enjoy a great story, fabulous writing and a complex plot.	2003-10-16

This story revolves around a true incident - Eleanor's frantic quest to raise an enormous ranson to secure the freedom of her favoured son Richard, but of course there are the little side stories that allow for the most fun, and this is where Justin comes in.  He is asked to travel to the border of Wales, and so solve the whereabouts of a portion of the ranson payment.  Along the way he encounters many characters who aren't what they seem, for good or bad, and of course solves the mystery.  Don't be fooled - this is an elegant and complex mystery, and one not easily figured out.<br />Along the way we encounter other characters that Penman fans will be familiar with from her other fantastic Welsh tales, butof course in a different time, and somewhat different place, and this makes the story all the more detailed.<br />If I have one very small criticism, it is that the book assumes that you have been with Justin since he first appeared in the equally fine \\"The Queen's Man\\", and that you are familiar with his life and loves, paternity and other lifetime issues.  I am, as would all devoted Sharon Penman fans, but for others who are new to her work through this book, it may be a little distracting.  Similarly however, as a fan I would probably find all the re-intoductions somewhat tedious, so I appreciate that this is a fine line when writing a story in a series.  But it is a very small criticism, and in no way detracts from the mastery of her writing, her meticulous attention to historical research and retelling, and the ability to spin a mighty good mystery.	2003-10-10

Samuel Johnson said &quot;There are few minds to which tyranny is not delightful&quot;, and when it comes to this amusing little book, how right he was.  Serious students of world domination may start with Machievelli's &quot;The Prince&quot;, the rest of us can have a laugh over this.<br />The chapters are an interesting tempters - they include &quot;Have You Got What it Takes?&quot;, which details the ideal personality of a leader; &quot;Career Paths to the Top&quot; which lists 10 jobs likely to lead to world domination (one is a parking inspector); &quot;Advanced World Rule&quot; which discusses among other things founding a faith and &quot;Posterity - Leaving Your Mark&quot; - the joy of large monuments and best selling memoirs.  There are enough real life tales here, told very tongue in cheek to make this quite an informative little book, but really it is just a very funny dig at the dictators and autocrats of the world.

I have always had a great fascination for the things that seem to define our lives in the Western world - those great style and cultural icons of our times.  And nothing seems to typify this, in a truly frivolous sense of course, more than Coca Cola.<br />This is detailed, meticulously researched and absolutely FASCINATING study of the history of Coke - not just who first made it and how it was first presented to a thirsty public (and no, it doesn't give you the formula), but how it has grown to become something that looms large in everyone's life, even if you're not a fan. More people drink Coca Cola in the world than coffee, but at this point I must confess that I don't drink Coke myself.<br />There are entertaining stories of how the product evolved from a syrup served at every soda bar (ever wondered about that cocaine rumour - its in the book!); how every soldier in WW2 had a coke at the front, even if they didn't have bullets and medical supplies; and how jealously Coke guard their market share and branding.  There are some really funny anecdotes from the Coke/Pepsi wars, especially when the formula was tinkered with to gain competitive advantage, and my favourite is the lady who berates a poor man stocking shelves with the &quot;new&quot; Coke, and when the man stacking Pepsi laughs, she berates him for his product as well.  This is an amusing study of our society and how this innocent fizzy brown drink has become one of the most universally recognised products of our times.<br />I remember I was reading this one night and my husband declared that he thought the whole book was nothing but an advertisement for Coca Cola.  I laughed, told him it was a very entertaining study of a product that is now literally everywhere in the world.  I then asked him to get me a Coke.	2003-09-18

The author purchased a small appartment in an old and relatively untouched partof Paris, and decided to research the history surroounding it.  Thus he embarks on a bit of an adventure to find out about the previous owners and the building's usage, and in doing so gives the reader a (relatively brief) overview of the area.<br />It really is a charming view of Paris and the joys of living in a city that has seen so much history, from the earliest times when the area was outside the old walled city, up to the revolution, the Nazi occupation and the terrorism that blights the world today.  The story is told in a charming and light hearted manner, and will appeal to those with a real interest in old Paris and all of its pleasures.<br />A small criticism - it could have been a bigger and more detailed book.  Obviously a city such as Paris has a fabulous and fascinating history that the house observed in its quiet way from its unobtrusive corner.  Perhaps there were no historical documents that tie it to these great events, but it was there nonetheless, and I feel that the book lacks a litle for these omissions.<br />Having said that, it is a charming book, and one which is well worth your time.	2003-09-16

This book is not as famous in Australia and I bought it on the strength of the reviews here on Amazon, but I must say that whereas the reviews do it justice in terms of how strong it is and well written it is, I was not prepared for the tears I cried at the end, and how much the story has effected me.  I find myself thinking of the central characters days after I have finished reading it.<br />I need not relate the plot, that has been done very well here, but it is all too easy to think of the things that we so willingly give up for an easy life.  Is this a prophetic book?  This is certainly an interesting point of discussion. My copy has a commentary by Ms Lowry at the back, and I noted with interest (through my tears) that the book is well read in Germany, where students read it in conjunction with stories of their own modern history, and I thought that this was a really telling observation.<br />I bought this book for my 12 year old daughter, but as she was half way through Harry Potter's fifth adventure, I thought I would read it first, and I'm pleased I did, as \\"The Giver\\" is a book that needs to be discussed and the reader almost de-briefed - it is such a powerful book.  So a message to all you parents out there - if your children have read or are going to read this book, you need to read it too, and give them the opportunity to discuss the themes and issues raised within.  This is not to suggest in any way that the book should be withheld from young readers - just that there will be value in your family to be able to discuss the characters and the future world in which they live.<br />It is a wonderful book - witty at times, and as I said, I cried at the end.  It is a truly powerful book that can make you laugh or cry, and this does both.  But anyone who dismisses this as a simple \\"young adult\\" novel is sadly mistaken.	2003-09-09

She vaguely realises this, but is never moved to do anything about it until her friend of many years dies, and she decides to spend time overseas.  Her destination of choice is Venice, and there the beauty and history of the place, and the different people she meets, touch her soul and makes her think and re-evaluate everything she has done with her life.  Cleverly interwoven with this is the story of Tobias, who is accompanied by an angel as he too ventures on a journey that will also change his life.<br />This all sounds very deep and meaningful, but it is a lovely, lyrical book, where the central character is charming in her self analysis, regrets and realisations of things lost, and we appreciate the small pleasures that she derives from a beautiful painting, a new lilac dress, and the discovery of new truths from her own research into the story of Tobias and the angel which has so fascinated her.  The other characters who populate her journey are equally enchanting, all of whom are not really who they appear to be, but all who help Miss Garnet appreciate what she has in life, as to a degree she does them as well.<br />If there is one small drawback with the book, it is that it immediately imbues the reader with a great desire to visit Venice, and to gaze upon paintings of angels.  But I'm sure I will get over this.  I will however, continue to remember this enchanting story, and I recommend it highly.  This is a first novel, and I trust that it is the beginning of a great career for a talented and insightful writer.	2003-09-02

And of course its not just a history of England that we are reading here, from time to time it was also a history of the known world - there were times when if England didn't own another country, they were coveting it, or were in some conflict with it.  And what fascinating people these royal people were.  They were of their times, they were shaped by the times, they were defeated by their times, and in being so helped shape the world that we see today.  They were competent, insane, brilliant, loyal, lecherous and obsessive.  This is a history of mankind - only far more visible!<br />Antonia Fraser is one of the finest historical writers today.  In this book she does not have the space or time to delve into the nitty gritty of the reigns of each monarch, but she does give a fascinating and insightful snap shot of their times.  This is a valuable reference book for any half serious library, as it deals not only with the people, but the times tthat they lived in.	2003-09-02

When we read this book, we come to understand the forces of the dynasty that created the man who would become the great Henry the Eighth, and the needs of his kingdom that drove his obsession to sire a son.<br />History has tended to relegate Henry's wives into some simplistic catergories - Catherine of Aragon as the dowdy hard done by cast-off; infamous Anne Boleyn as a woman who played for high stakes and lost; and sweet Jane Seymour, who gave Henry his son but sadly died.  Then there were the other three wives who somehow never seemed so fascinating, and as such have had much less of the limelight.  But never were there six more different women, and each has made their impact on history in a number of different ways.<br />Alsion Weir has written this book with such richness and attention to detail, that at times you forget that you are reading non-fiction and get swept away in the fervour that can come with a great novel.  But never has the imagination given an author such rich fodder as Henry and his love life, and his increasing desperation to sire more children as he got older.  The six women that graced his life so so long or for such a short period of time are well defined, and we come to care for all of them as the book progresses.  We come to understand their wishes and desires, and we feel sorrow for them as we see that frequently they were only pawns in the great dynastic chess game of the time.  And of course we catch a glimpse of the other Tudors - the deeply religious Mary, who was forever scarred by her mother's treatment; Edward who was manipulated by his mother's family, and finally Elizabeth, who grew up branded a bastard and for many years feared the retribution that may have followed her mother's fall from favour.<br />Not only is this a really great read, it is also a meticulously researched and presented reference book, one which will be treasured for many years to come.ured for many years to come.	2003-09-02

It had to be worth a try.  And what a gem it is - a detailed and historically accurate picture of life in 14th Century Norway, complete with a fesity herione, hulking men and the entire range of human emotions in all their glory.<br />The novel begins with our hero Kristin bathing in the love of her parents in living in the comfort of a wealthy home.  As she grows, she finds herself completely in love, and against the wishes of her parents and her betrothed (another far more suitable man) pursues and secures the man of her dreams.  But of course we must be careful what we wish for, and the novels take us through the trials and tribulations of life with someone you love, but are not necessarily suited to.<br />This is a rich and detailed novel, that is not always to read, but at time it was so powerful that it reduced me to tears.  You become completely involved in the character's lives, and in the end this gives you a real sense of satisfaction in your reading.<br />It certtainly is a different book, and one which is well worth your time.	2003-03-05

It is really a story of people, and their incredibly complex lives, and in that it loses its way a little.  The characters are only hinted at, whereas I like to know more about them, and their adventures drift into the fantastic, whilst attempting to stay grounded in the real world.<br />Somehow it doesn't get there.

There is a marvellous twist in the tale which I have to confess that I didn't see coming, and despite the real horrors of the story, left me satisfied and smiling at the end.<br />But this is not a perfect book - some of the other reviewers have mentioned the inaccuracies of the time and the geography, and how parts of some of the characters' adventures and activities are a little too pat.  All of this is true.  But we forgive all of that as we read the letters which demonstrate so well the dissolving of a lifetime's ties of friendship, and the infinitely clever revenge that is eventually had.<br />So, not a perfect book, but a very, very good one (4 and a half stars really), and one that I would recommend to anyone who is interested in history, clever writing, and who loves a story with a twist in the tale!	2002-11-27

It is not terribly long, and we are offered only a very brief snapshot into the lives of the characters around which the story evolves.  The main character is a widow who seeks a new life in a small coastal village in Ireland after her husband is tragically killed and finds a sort of guilty hard won happiness with her painting and her cat.  Her loneliness is broken occasionally by the visits of her distant son, and eventually she finds a different sort of happiness with the eccentric war hero who has bought the local abandoned railway station with a view to restoring it.<br />If this is a novel of anything however, it is how fleeting any happiness can be.  In the background of this seemingly innocent tale is the great Irish &quot;troubles&quot; - hints of the IRA and matters far from innocent.  It has all the ingredients for a rich and fascinating tale.<br />However, all of these ingredients do not really make for the wonderful tale that it could be - it falls a little far from the mark.  We do not get to know these pivotal characters very well - things are hinted at in their past but never elaborated on. There is some issue brewing in the background, and somehow this is only hinted at until the shocking conclusion - shocking in both what happens and how abruptly it finishes the book.  It is certainly well written, and has the promise of a far greater novel, but that is all it is - the promise of a great novel, and one that falls way short.	2002-10-01

There is weaves its spell over the police officers who work there, and this tale is told to the teenage son of one of these officers, now deceased.<br />This is a chilling book rather than terrifying.  Mr King takes great care to show how the car has woven its spell, but that the people involved still manage to have what passed for normal every day lives.  The wonderful part of this book is in the detail - you can really see the car which is not quite right, and you can imagine the world that it opens a door to.  The visitors that come from that world occasionally keep up the interest and the &quot;horror&quot; aspect.<br />But ultimately it is a tale of how we are all drawn to things that we know in our rational selves that we should leave well enough alone, and it is done very, very well.	2002-09-29

But Ms Gregory has a few of the facts a little muddled, and as history is always stranger than fiction, I do have to wonder why she chose to change anything about this fantastic story. For example, Ann was Mary's younger sister, not elder, and this may have put quite a different spin on their relationship. Mary's son Henry was her first born child, not second. And finally, there was absolutely no evidence that Ann ever committed incest with her brother George, and the book hints very heavily that this was indeed what happened.<br />I guess we can just pass this off as historical fiction, and Ms Gregory certainly does do this well, painting a vivid image of Ann as a young woman who gambled all and lost, and endangered her family in the process. But this was a well documented time in history, and whereas I am willing to give historical authors a lot of leeway with characterisation, I do like my facts to be right.<br />It is a ripping tale all right, and it is well written, but I still found myself disappointed with the liberties taken with the facts.	2002-09-09

It is based upon the true events of a small village which isolated itself with the outbreak of plague; it has finely drawn and believable characters; and the writing is of a style that you could almost imagine it was really written at the time (please don't let this latter point put you off - the writing is not in any way archaic, as is often the trend these days).<br />It is also however, profoundly sad, and I found myself weeping with the characters at their loss in an early part of the novel.  I always think that is is a powerful book that can make you laugh or cry.<br />The story of the people of this small village and their trials and tribulations in this terrible time is absolutely mesmerising.  We watch them cling to their faith in God, and then turn to earlier more earthy superstitions to help them deal with the wave of death that has struck so many of them down.  We also watch the development of the narrator from a simple village girl who thirsts for knowledge into the strong character she is by the end of the novel.<br />Some of the earlier reviewers have commented that the end seems a little pat, almost as if the author wanted to finish the book and be done with it.  I must admit that it doesn't finish the way I would have liked it to, but having said that, I truly do not believe that it in any way takes away from the mastery of the book.<br />It is a fascinating, well written and well researched book.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.	2002-08-29

I love the way that the characters develop and interact with each other, and in a truly well written family saga there is the added attraction of major world historical events to put their lives into perspective.  Alas, this book has very little of this.<br />The interesting characters are there, sure enough, but we learn almost nothing of them.  They have joys and terrible tragedies, and these are all glossed over as we march through the years.  There is no true development of the lives of the families - they are all entirely superficial.  Even when one of the main characters goes to war and becomes famous for his heroics, this is dealt with in one or two paragraphs.<br />The author certainly has talent, and I'm sure it will develop, but this is a very disappointing effort, and I struggled to finish it.  Even then I got the impression that she was in a hurry to finish the book.  There are far superior family sagas on the market.	2002-08-21

As an ardent fan of Ms Penman, I found myself disappointed with the characters in a time in history when the real players were as fascinating as any who have ever walked the earth.  Eleanor is my favourite historical character, and Henry and Thomas Becket were among the most powerful personalities of their times.  Alas, I feel that this book does not do them justice.  Henry is portrayed well enough, as the fesity and stubborn king, but Eleanor is relegated to child-producing wife, and almost nothing is mentioned of Becket, save to imply that he was perhaps losing his mind.<br />What is worse, is that by far the most interesting character in the book is fictional - Henry's uncle Ranulf.  Fair enough, you might say, this is a novel.  But I don't understand why Ms Penman places so much emphasis on a fictional character, when the real ones give her such rich material.<br />However, when all is said and done, this is a novel, and a well written one at that.  Therefore it was able to keep me engrossed enough to finish it in my usual rapid time.  But beware that this is a book which is clearly intended to have a sequel - we have yet to see any of the fireworks between Henry and Eleanor that marked the latter years of their marriage, and I hope that Ms Penman will let us see these characters in all their glory in the next book.<br />If you are not someone with a great interest and knowledge of the period, you will enjoy this as it is a ripping story full of interesting people.  If not, you may find that the book leaves the most fascinating people in history a little wanting, and in turn leaves you wanting a little more.	2002-08-05

I was at first sceptical, and I must confess it did not grab me within the first few chapters as I had hoped that it would.  The main character is a dwarf, the child of a mentally ill mother and a father disabled in World War 1, and whereas her life looked as if it would be interesting, if filled with angst, I was confident that this itself would not hold my attention for the whole of the book.<br />How wrong I was, becuase it is not Trudi's life that grabs you, it is the world she is living in - the horror of Germany between the wars.  It is difficult to find words to describe how that world changes, with the rise of Adolf Hitler, and the slow and deliberate persecution of the Jews, and the terror of ordinary citizens who barely dared to question what was hapening to their lives.  The story becomes shocking, unimaginable and utterly compelling.  I also think that it is something that everyone should read, and I like my friend, will recommend it to everyone.<br />It is not an easy story to read, and Trudi, the main character is spiky and independent - not always easy to identify with.  But is an important book because it also chronicles the life of everyday Germans who were caught up in unspeakable times, and it is with these characters that our sympathies lie.<br />I am pleased that I took my friend's recommendation.  Again, not an easy read, but a picture of history that cannot be ignored.  It is a truly compelling and magnificent novel.	2002-07-01

It starts with a great deal of promise - a wounded hero, an old house on a big wooded property, and something quite mysterious in his past.  Even the promise of fairies and all things good and bad seemed enticing.<br />And so it is - to an extent.  The story starts out promisingly enough, but I feel that what could have been an immensely powerful story loses its way with both the horror (which is the standard yucky stuff) and the unexpectedly explicit nature of the erotica.  If you are not aware of this be warned - it is quite graphic, including references to masturbation and lesbianism, and may not appeal to everyone. I also feel that Mr Herbert missed the opportunity to include more of the fairy folk in his woods - to explore their relationship with the land and their supernaural interaction with the characters and the setting.<br />Overall it is an interesting read, well written of course, and the story trips along at a fair pace.  I felt that the ending was somewhat hurried, as is often the case with novels such as this, almost as if the author was caught out and felt that he or she couldn't quite find a satisfactory ending.  It was an enjoyable read, certainly not James Herbert's best, but it is different enough to be interesting.	2002-04-04

It has all the ingredients of a life and friendships gone badly wrong, but it has many other interesting features that make it very worthy of the reader's attention.<br />The story begins in the first person, being told by the purchaser of a rare violin at auction.  He pays considerable money for it, but is thrilled to have it.  He in turn is visited by someone who was also interested in purchasing the violin, but missed the auction. This man relates to the buyer a story of a fascinating man that he had met - the owner of the violin, and how he was unsure at the end of their meeting that he had ever even existed!  In telling that story to the buyer, this man then relates the life tale of the violin owner as told to him, of his musical obsession and a great friendship gone badly wrong.  A life story, told to a story teller, who tells the narrator, who is in turn telling us, the reader.  It is a fascinating and very clever plot device.<br />The story itself is one of music obsession, of discipline and friendship, and woven through it is the underlying menace of the rise of the Third Reich and the horrors of Europe in the 1930s.  But it is the surprise ending, and the revelation of the identity of the purchser of the violin that had me most surprised.  I never saw it coming, and I do love to be surprised in a book!  It is certainly an abrupt ending, and of course it leaves many loose ends, but I think this adds to the impact of the final chapter.  It is a finely woven and written story, and it will stay with you for some time.<br />I recommend it highly.	2002-02-08

I should probably add that the movie follows the story faithfully and does it very well - it is one of my favourite movies.  But somehow the story is always a little better.<br />What is interesting about the story is there is more of a feeling of the sheer weight of time Andy spends in prison.  There is not one cheif warden or sadistic guard, there are several, who come and go as the years roll on.  The posters change of course, but the friendships that Andy forges remain.  And the spectacular ending - just as we imagine.<br />It is fortunate that this is a story that has translated so well to film - so often such things fall well short of the mark.  But it is well worth reading in its own right, and I recommend it highly.  If you cannot find the story by itself, it does appear in &quot;Different Seasons&quot; with 3 other equally good stories.	2002-01-22

That this can be achieved in the space of a short story is amazing - we have a very lttle time before we are faced with the shocking truth.<br />&quot;The Lottery&quot; is the finest short story of its genre, and stands alone as one of the greatest stories ever written.  Shirley Jackson is a master, and her novels &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; and &quot;We Have Always Lived in the Castle&quot; are also engrossing reads.  But &quot;The Lottery&quot;?

There is our heroine Katherine, with all of her trials and tribulations, and who finds herself unexpectedly thrust into a turbulent life with a turbulent royal family!  It is interesting to note that through the children she had with John of Gaunt, she is a direct ancestress of all of ruling Kings and Queens of England from that time on (and a great many members of European royal families as well)!  Katherine made her mark on history in many, many ways.<br />This is an utterly charming and beautiful book.  I was about 12 when I first picked it up and was immediately enchanted by the writing, the adventure and the history, and return to it time and time again.  The book is peppered with other interesting historical characters - for example Geoffrey Chaucer was married to Katherine's sister, and appears from time to time full of wit and stories.<br />So read it for yourself, and introduce it to a young lady in your life.

In many ways it is like the famous French gastronomic dictionaries with explanations of the foods that we eat and the seasonings and other basic ingredients, but it also has fabulous ways to use and appreciate these ingredients.  As Stephanie is one of Australia's most famous cooks, we are also privy to many of her secrets and favourites - really yummy things!<br />Best of all it is extremely readable - I mean sit comfortably and read it simply for the pleasure of the contents.  It explains why certain cuts of meats are the best, how herbs and spices grow and are used, different ways of working with fruits and vegetables - it is a spectacular scholarly and entertaining book.<br />As a collector of books I am also lured by the glamour of glossy cookbooks with their mouthwatering recipes and artful pictures.  This book has none of this, but it is smeared with chocolate and dappled with olive oil, lemon juice, flour and dried parsley.  Surely this is the best indication of a level of usage for any cookbook.  Track it down and buy it!	2002-01-09

This book reproduces these woodcuts faithfully, and the images are not diminished by the format of the book as is often the case.<br />These images are the stuff of nightmares - hell, torment, torture and death, and yet the images are so startlingly realistic as to be almost poignant in their representations.  Enjoyt the images for what they are - works of genius.

As well, we are treated to interesting insights into life in France in the aftermath of the Revolution - for example, who would have thought that an education was so hard to secure after the church was frowned upon, because it was the church that provided the bulk of the schools?<br />The heart and soul of this book is our hero Champollion, who was a child progidy, a professor at the age of 18, and always struggling with poverty and his thirst for knowledge.  This book cleverly details his struggle to unravel the mystery of heiroglyphics - what really becomes a true obsession for him, and how he was totally driven by his need to succeed.  Indeed his life was frequently difficult - somehow he usually managed to be on the wrong side of whatever was fashionable at the time.<br />So from this point of view - as a study of a fascinating, driven and obsessed man, this is a very good book.  If it has one flaw, and I guess its a major one - there is not enough detail of how he finally deciphered the heiroglyphics. We the reader are given only tastes of his true genius and persistence.  Maybe this is fair enough, maybe it is so complex that the subject deserves a whole book of its own - this is after all the story of Champollion, but there is an expectation of more, and it really doesn't deliver.<br />It still makes for a very entertaining read.  Champollion was a fascinating man, and he has a fascinating story.  Read this book for this reason, and enjoy it.	2002-01-07

The young girl Leilani, one of the central characters, is a truly spectacular creation, and her good friend Micky is equally interesting.  But it is the &quot;young motherless boy&quot; (to tell you more would be to give it away) and his adventures are really the heart of the book, and very entertaining it is too.<br />If I have one small criticism, it is that the evil monster in the book takes his time to show his hand.  He is a very good baddie, but I got a little impatient waiting for him to show itself in all his glory.  And when he finally got around to acting on it, I thought that he was a little incompetent (which of course was good for our heroes).<br />It is a good read, well paced and full of action, and all in all a good read.  It also makes some interesting and amusing comment on people who travel the country seeking signs of extra terrestrial activity, amd more serious comment on the extremes of bio-ethicism.<br />However it is not his best (try &quot;Strangers&quot; and &quot;Dark Rivers of the Heart&quot; for classic Koontz), but it is a satisfying read.	2001-12-30

I am very glad I did - it is the finest novel of the Indian sub-continent that I have encountered.<br />The lives of the main characters are certainly not easy, so I guess I must confess that there is a fair share of the aforementioned doom and gloom.  But our heroes are so well drawn, so fully rounded and so full of adventure and thirst for whatever life throws at them (and it throws plenty), that you get completely sucked into the complexities of their existences.<br />Rohinton Mistry is a fine, talented writer.

Just the fact that he was able to use his family's oral history to trace this wonderful story is an achievement most modern authors are unable to lay claim to.  And it is a fabulous story, rich in detail and for the first few generations after Kunta Kinte we really get to know the characters.<br />But it is the very fact that we know intimately only the first few generations that makes this fine work lack something.  There is a disproportionate amount of time focused on Kunta Kinte, and whereas this is important, as his is the most harrowing and heart rending story, I feel it takes a little too much of the book.  And towards then end, the characters get barely a mention.  I should imagine that Alex's father has a story which is equally worth telling, but the latter generations are glossed over.  I would really like to know more about these people too.<br />So it is a magnificent achievement, easy to read and riveting.  But it loses steam about half way through, and there is little flesh in the story towards the end.

Many of the other reviewers have criticised the novel for being too wordy, and Mr Manson is certainly infatuated with the English language, but I don't think this detracts too much from the work. The story becomes more and more predictable as it progresses, and again this has been a criticism, but I think it is more a deliberate plot device, slowly drawing the reader in. Whereas the ending is not a surprise by the time it arrives, it has a punch nonetheless.<br />If I have a criticism of the book, it is that I had some real issues in placing the story in any particular time. It almost reads as if it is set at the turn of the century, but it is clearly not. At one point I thought it was set in the 60s, but this does not add up when you consider how long the main character has been married.

And what a good bad guy he is - evil to the core but still sensitive, suave and polished - a true psychopath. And on the good people's side they are also interesting - we have the twin brothers who are obsessed with the evils of man and nature, the saintly mother who had been abused by her own father, the good natured pharmacist whose wife is afflicted with polio, the charismatic police detective who was once a priest.  They are all well drawn and believable, and the plot moves along at a fair pace.<br />If I have one small criticism, it is the ending.  It is as if Mr Koontz has had enough with all the unpleasantness that goes with a horror novel and slapped a sugar glaze on everything and everyone.  The fate of the bad guy is clever enough, but the rest is a little disappointing.  But after a ripper novel, this is a small criticism, and I do recommend it.	2001-10-03

It is historically accurate (inaccuracy is my pet peeve), the characters are well defined, and there is all the excitement of romance in the wilds of Scotland. Jamie is indeed a male character that we could all fall in love with. So it is with all these things that I write this review with some trepidation, well aware that I am suggesting that a book which is very dear to lots of people's hearts is less than wonderful.<br />Lets get started. Firstly, Ms Gabaldon uses a tried and tested plot device that never ceases to annoy me. Our heroine Claire, fesity and intelligent though she is, finds herself time and time again in life threatening situations, and lo and behold she is rescued by the gallant Jamie in the nick of time. This is exciting once, but it wears a bit thin after a while, and after a time we begin to wonder at Claire's stupidity. It also means that any suspense generated by our herione's situation is dulled by the fact that we know that the handsome hero will be there any moment.<br />Secondly, Ms Gabaldon seems determined to inflict all manner of injuries and tortures on our hero Jamie. Now Claire is a nurse - a healer, and I can understand what a powerful thing it is in a romance story for the heroine to nurse the handsome and ailing hero back to health and true love. But I really think it is done to death in this book (excuse the pun), and the final torture scenes are graphic in a way that is entirely unneccessary for this type of romance. Indeed by the time Jamie and Claire had recovered from this dreadful assault (as I knew they would) I was beginning to lose interest in their story. If I want horror I will read a horror story.<br />Alas I found by the end of the book that I was disinterested in their on-going story, and was pleased that the book could be read by itself. I must stress that I consider in many ways that this is a mighty good read, and it is certainly different to many of the bodice rippers that fill our bookshelves.

So it was bought down from the bookshelf, the dust blown off it, and we settled down for a read.  I had forgotten what a gem this book is.<br />The illustrations alone are worth the purchase price.  If you are interested in fine art, let alone book illustrations, you will apreciate this book.  The text is well written and amusing, with a great deal of attention to the smaller details of the small people's lives.  And let us not forget the less than nice faeries - the bad faeries who we think are best forgotten.  They also get a slice of the action.  It is sometimes pleasant to have that little shiver of frightening childhood memories.<br />It is a delightful book.  Its not strictly a children's book but you will be very fondly remembered by any child you present this to as a gift.  Its not strictly an adult book either, but hey, let's live a little!  Leave it on your coffee table and I guarantee everyone will pick it up.  Maybe it has its own little bit of magic.	2001-09-26
US	52872993	RQBYVFYFB8CT5	0316290238	741461517	The Collector (Back Bay Books)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Powerful, disturbing and compelling	This is a really unusual book which is so well written that you can identify with both the kidnapper - the frighteningly normal Clegg, and the object of his &quot;collection&quot; Miranda. The book starts with Clegg's obsession with collecting beautiful things, and moves through his day to day interaction with the woman he has abducted. The second half deals with Miranda coming to terms with what has happened to her, and her plans and desires to escape.<br />It is very well written, and you could amost imagine that there are two authors putting together the novel - one for each viewpoint. It is utterly compelling writing, and it is truly chilling. Clegg could be anyone you know for all of his well hidden psycopathic tendencies. What is worse is the thought that any of us could be Miranda. The story draws you further and further in and presents us with a vision of reality that is utterly terrifying, even though no-one would think to classify this as a horror novel. The ending will leave you breathless and shocked.<br />This book is definitely one of the classics of 20th Century fiction, and one which everyone should read.	2001-09-26

It is quite well written, and the characters are well defined, and there is the pleasures of childhood in the French countryside all nicely laid out before us. But it isn't long before the allure of the story gives way to its much darker nature.  There are the broader themes of the WW2 French resistance and German collaborators interwoven with the childhood memories, and how our heroine, now an elderly widow, strives to remain anonymous in a town that still despises her family because of its involvement in these matters so long ago.<br />It is this darkness that makes me give this book 3 stars when I might have rated it higher.  The idyllic childhood is nothing of the sort - the children are neglected by their ailing widowed mother, and they quickly become infatuated with the Germans and the thrills of being involved with them in what they think is harmless fun, but secretly know to be otherwise.  Our heroine is actually quite a spiteful and manipulative little girl, and although she interseperses her memories with pity for her mother, this doesn't take the edge off that spite.  And even though our heroine improves with age, the current day characters of her nephew and his wife take on that continuing unpleasant role.<br />The novel also takes its time getting to the truth that is the core of that darkness and the reason our heroine wishes to remain anonymous.  When I finally got there I was almost beyond caring about it, and I was frankly disappointed that I was able to work out what happened even before the event finally was revealed.  What should have been the most suspenseful part of the book fell way short of expectations.<br />So all in all this was a novel that had a fascinating and complex idea, dealing with issues that are still sensitive today.  However, it somehow misses the mark, and whereas it was an interesting and quite well written read, it left me feeling vaguely uncomfortable, and I'm not sure whether or not I enjoyed it.ling vaguely uncomfortable, and I'm not sure whether or not I enjoyed it.	2001-09-20
US	52872993	R1LYXFBHCOTGXW	0312961006	653774129	The Trickster	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Well constructed horror tale with a few flaws	If you like horror stories, you'll like this book.  It has enough hideous murders to make Stephen King cringe, and the story pays meticulous attention to the characters and their lives, in a picture perfect Canadian ski town.  I particularly liked the story mechanism which took the reader back to earlier in the century, when railroad workers unwittingly unleash the being that is the trickster.<br />However, there are a few flaws in the story, and they are quite serious ones.  First and foremost is the author's continuing message of childhood sexual abuse amongst native Canadian families.  If this is an important part of the plot, then so be it, but I think it is seriously overdone and takes away from some of the suspense, not to mention adding to the general distaste the reader may feel.  Sometimes a little subtlety goes a long way.<br />Secondly, our hero/prime suspect's son suspects that there is sonething wrong with his father, and this is manifested throughout the novel as fear, until almost the end when he completely turns his thoughts around.  Somehow any value that this plot device has had up to that time is lost at this point.<br />The ending is jumbled, but this appears to be standard fare with horror books that deal with the supernatural.  Perhaps authors have difficulties articulating the end of a horror they have worked so hard to create.<br />But criticisms aside, this is an interesting read, and it kept me appropriately engrossed for a few days.  The author is a talented writer, and I look forward to anything else she may write.	2001-09-17

Reincarnation is one of those topics that is likley to engender heated debate at any dinner party.  There are those who say they'd like to believe, and those that think that it is all a lot of nonsense.  Whatever your opinion on the topic, and you're bound to have one - very few people are indifferent - this is a truly fascinating and well researched introduction.<br />The topics range from Western people who have amazing experiences after hynosis to young Asian people who are adamant that they were someone different in a previous life.  Cynicism aside, this makes for a really good read, and in all honesty it is hard to argue the nonsense side when faced with this well written argument for belief.<br />Even if you continue to think it is all fiction, this is a very written look into a contraversial topic.  It not only looks at the expereinces of the individuals, but also the social contexts in which they live, and this adds to the interest.  It is well worth an addition to the library of anyone with the remotest of interest in the subject.	2001-09-11

I like the way she intersperses the story with letters, e-mails, medical and police reports and the like.  It all adds texture and interest to the story.  But then we are faced with the topic, and it is no simple murder mystery.  In this book she deals with all the horror of things that human beings can do to one another, and strong medicine it is too.  As such I have given the book 2 stars instead of 5 that I would have given for style and narration.<br />The subject matter is vile.  There is prejudice, bigotry, hatred and violence to both humans and animals in all of its ugly glory, and it sickened me.  I have read many books with equally graphic horrors without bother - perhaps it is a testament to Ms Wlaters' writing that it got to me so effectively.  The end of the book is utterly heart rending and shocking and stayed with me for days.<br />Well, you might say, it is a murder mystery.  Surely all such stories are ugly be definition?  Perhaps, but with this one Ms Walters has quite outdone herself, and despite all of her undoubted writing skills and ability to tell a tale, this is quite a difficult book to read and to feel comfortable with.	2001-09-11

Anyone interested in Egyptology or the Ottoman Empire will also be surprised by the little bits of interesting information that permeate the tale.<br />It is only a small book, but it is a big story.  At times the writing itself appears a little stilted, but the author does a good job with the topic nonetheless.  It is well worth reading.	2001-09-11
US	52872993	R26WCQRZ0RQBWK	0312254954	923817950	Delirium of the Brave	Books	2	4	8	N	N	Dreadfully disappointing	It is with interest that I picked up this book based on the glowing reviews here on Amazon.  I like novels of American history, and I am especially fond of generational sagas. However, I must confess that I was very disappointed, because even though the story holds a great deal of promise in terms of its plot and location, it is very badly written.<br />My chief gripe is the very poor character development.  The reader gets to know very little of any of the characters because the author has attempted to cram so much into their lives.  For example, one of our heroes loves a girl, loses girl, takes up with another, goes to war, suffers dreadful injuries, studies to become a priest, takes a break from this, miraculously recovers from injuries and finds girl again.  Any of these elements of his life is worthy of closer scrutiny, but they are all glossed over in the unseemly haste to make this a sprawling epic.<br />Even the bad guys get a rush job.  None of the elements of a truly evil character are really brought to the fore, and they are by far the most interesting people in this busy novel.<br />And to add insult to injury the ending was so predictable that I could have screamed.  After all I had only perservered with it to find out how it ended.  I could have given it 1 star for the writing, but I decided to give it 2 stars in order to acknowledge that it could have been a really magnificent novel.	2001-09-10

It has the same magic and attention to detail, but gives you a greater insight into the lives of these little busy creatures, with just the right amount of whimsy.<br />There is more focus on different tales from various parts of the world, and certainly more of the fabulous drawings.

It has magical characters, magnificent finely drawn illustrations, and presents an overall philosophy of life that we could all learn lessons from.  Please don't be fooled into thinking that it is just a children's book - it is a wonderful addition to any library.<br />It has a believable and detailed discussion of the food is are most loved by gnomes, how they raise their children, when they marry, where they live, what sorts of pets they have (cute mice in little baskets!) and how they tend to animals in the wild.  The section which shows a cut away of their house is worth the purchase price alone - the imagination and thought that has gone into this book is amazing.<br />So if you want a little whimsy in your library, or on your coffee table, this is the book for you.  If you want a book with magnificently detailed ilustrations, this is a book for you.  Overall I think it is a book for everyone who is young at heart, or who likes a little magic in their everyday lives.	2001-09-06

If you have seen the movie, which is equally delightful, you get the picture, though be warned, some of the characters and scenarios have changed a little on the big screen.<br />If you like chocolate, you will of course like this book.  The descriptions of Vianne's wares are just like standing in a chocolate shop and I suppose that these goodies are the real characters in the book.  It really does evoke the passion of chocolate, and how it can change a life, and even an entire community.<br />If I have a small criticism of the book, it is that it is a little predictable, but then again so is the taste of a good chocolate, and we never let that get in the way!

It is an art form driven by the culture of the artsists, and this book covers the traditional works of desert Australia, and also touches on more the more contemporary works of urban dwellers.  These works are vibrant and alive, and the illustrations do justice to the richness of the work.  The accompanying text is detailed and authoritative.<br />If you are interested in the art works of other cultures, or even art in its broadest sense, you will find many of the works presented in this volume to be quite different, even provocative.  Others are as spectacular as any landscape known to the Western world.<br />This is an excellent introduction to a complex topic, and a worthy addition to any library.	2001-08-23

It is the story of an elderly starving tiger, who decides to masquerade as a tiger skin rug in order to access the table scraps of the Maharaja's family, and therefore live a little longer.  In the process he saves the life of the Maharaja, and becomes a much loved member of the family.<br />It is an utterly delightful story.  The tiger is appropriately tatty and dejected, but after several night time munchings and days as a rug he becomes fatter and sleeker, and the family speculate endlessly on how the old rug seems to be improving with age.<br />The book is wonderfully illustrated, and just a joy to share with children who can all feel for the poor tiger.  It may well be my husband's favourite - it is also one of mine as well.	2001-08-23

And don't we all love to read letters!  Especially other people's - there is something mysterious and forbidden about it.  The letters are beautifully written, and really engross you with their richness and detail.<br />And it is a beautiful looking book too.

She is feisty, she is brave, and she lives through all the horrors you expect in a richly detailed historical drama of pioneering Americans.  And to make it all the more entertaining, it is her diary.  This is very appealing to all of those who like to see in the secret hearts of our characters - what better way but to read their diary?<br />The writing of the diary itself is masterful.  Sarah's literacy improves with the years, making the book easier to read.  And along the way she meets and at first scorns the man of her dreams, who is definintely one of the more romantic male characters of recent fiction.<br />Overall it is the most enjoyable book I have read in ages.

What I found was a well crafted and entertaining historical novel, and if I am none the wiser as to whether the story is truth or fiction, I am still well satisfied with the adventure and the characters.<br />It is a richly detailed story of medieval life, and a story of a strong young woman with formidable intellectual abilities, stifled by her womanhood in a male dominated world.  In an effort to gain the education she so badly wants, she takes on the persona of her slain brother, and rises through the church ranks to that of Pope.<br />It may be a fanciful story, and it may not be.

It is an interesting mixture of the main character's journal (which is by far the majority of the text) and the observations of the local people and staff on his estate.<br />It is certainly a fascinating and richly detailed account of what would be considered at any time chronic eccentricity bordering on madness - the endless underground tunnels and odd eating habits alone are enough to convince you of this, but what I feel is a small weakness of the novel is that there is simply not enough external observations of the Duke.  Those observations by the house-keeper and the footman etc are little gems of insight, but they are too few.<br />The prose itself is beautiful, and once again invokes the feeling of the time wonderfully.  It is a fine novel, well worth a read.	2001-07-04

Wat and his friends have all manner of exciting escapades as birds, as fish, and as combatants with witches, and in the background there is all the fanciful goings on of a very disorganised medieval castle.<br />There are many novels which deal with the Arthurian legend, some well, most tastefully, and some take themselves entirely too seriously.

Interspersed with the well crafted and written story of the lives of these two men we also have the pomp and formality of the British Court System.  This in itself makes the book one of the finest legal thrillers I have read.<br /><br />Ultimately such a story must have an ending.  And what an ending!  As they say, you read a book to get to the ending and you won't be disappointed.  It is a fabulous novel and one I highly recommend.	2001-06-27

How wrong I was!<br />It is a complex and detailed murder story, with some of the best drawn characters I have ever read in a book. It is quite unusual in that for, perhaps the first quarter of the book, you are never really sure of the relationships between the characters who are told in rememberance by our narrator, and who is the god-daughter of the chief character Constance. This is not a criticism, it is an interesting plot device which allows us to really get to know the characters before they are put into some other context - that of their relationships with the narrator and the fascinating Constance.<br />Constance herself is a total enigma, and around her swirl the cast of the novel and the horrendous death which took place in 1910, on a night when many were gathered to see Halley's comet. Was the death a terrible accident, or something more sinister?<br />It is absolutely engrossing, and sometimes shocking. It will keep you guessing about many things until the very end and you won't be able to put it down.	2001-06-27

And the feeling of the warmth of the South shines through as well.  But it is Fannie Flagg's use of the written word that pleased me as well, it is lyrical, and it touches the heart.<br />This is only a short novel, but it is so full of passion and humour that it is hard not to think of it as a big book.  It is delightful and I recommend it highly.	2001-06-27

If you enjoy Arthurian legends, and I certainly do, you will love these books.  However they are somewhat diffferent to books in this genre as they have Merlin as the central character, and it is a very human and fallible Merlin to boot.<br />Mary Stewart has shown some masterful skills with these novels.  It is rare to read a book about a character and still be aware all along that he or she is not really what it is all about.  The historical details are rich and finely painted, and Merlin himself is an entirely believable character - a loner, desperate for friends, and even more desperate to discover the identity of his father - tainted with the stain of bastardry as he is.<br />All in all they are, in my opinion, the best books of their type.	2001-06-27

Well this is true enough, the propsering part anyway, but the history is interwoven with a very modern story.  This is not a criticism as such, as it is an engaging story, but it is not what I expected at all.<br />It is in fact the story of today's McDonalds, told in flashback to our narrator's youth and the trials and tribulations that have made him and his family what they are today.  It is difficult reading in places - the family have not always had happy lives, but there is a quiet splendour in the telling of that story.<br />It is a good book - not a great book I fear, as the story rambles a little and there were times when I wondered where it was going.  But it is an interesting book as are most books which observe families, and the little bits of history thrown in embroider the story nicely.	2001-06-26

The other stories were neither here nor there really.<br />But I am pleased to report that they all have justified the purchase, and I have enjoyed them all.

However I think its real value is that it is an interesting and detailed reference book.<br />Have you ever read a horror novel that makes reference to some obscure demon up from the pits of Hell?  This book will tell you all about it.  Or some historical romance which makes reference to someone who spoke out against the church?  Again, you'll find them here.  As well as all manner of people who have spoken out against all manner of things throughout history and from all faiths and view points.<br />It was the title that made me pick it up in the first place, and I think the suggestion is that these are people/things who would populate the under-world.  Rather tongue in cheek I think, but eye catching just the same.<br />So if you are a serious reader and you like interesting reference books, pick up a copy of this.

It is not expensive, and I note there are some comments on the quality of the print, but this is a comic strip!  How often have you peered at your favourite comic in some tatty old newspaper?<br />The strips aren't in any particular order, but what I like about it is that you can pick it up and open it at any page for a few moments of delight.  All the characters are there, in all the situations you recognise them - Charlie Brown on the pitcher's mound, Snoopy on his kennel, Lucy as psychiatrist and so on.  Just what Peanuts is all about.<br />I think this is a great book to have lying around, and remember, it is a book of comic strips designed to entertain and amuse.	2001-06-21

I can never read it without dissolving into tears (it is quite therapeutic if you need a good cry), but it is not a &quot;mushy&quot; story as such.  It is profoundly moving, and you will not forget it in a hurry.<br />Everyone should read this beautiful story.

And aren't we grateful for it!  Susam Loomis does a lovely job of sharing the trials and tribulations of buying and renovating her home in France, and even her occasional cooking mishaps are enjoyable.<br />What I enjoy about this book is that Susan has a young child, and this offers a slightly different perspective to other books in this genre (Peter Mayle's &quot;A Year in Provence&quot; being the most memorable).  As well we have the usual recipes, all sounding delicious, and the day to day amsements and disasters that beset her, all adding up to an enchanting book.	2001-06-20

But this is a really great novel, which draws these apparently dissimilar threads together into a truly compulsive read.<br />Not only is our anti-hero quite fascinating in his own right, but we are given an insight into his life and history - the path that was made for him by virtue of his birth and the times in which he has lived.  In the present, we have the fascinating distractions of his caving, and of course his enemies - who make this a truly thrilling story.<br />It is a riveting book - a &quot;read it in one night to see what happens&quot; type of book.  It is Trevanian's best book by far.	2001-06-20

They are warm and gentle, like all good animal stories, and will appeal to anyone who loves cats or has any animal in their family who dominates their lives.<br />These are not spectacular, earth shattering stories, but if feel like curling up with a good book, this will fill that requirement well.

I like the way she intersperses the story with letters, e-mails, medical and police reports and the like.  It all adds texture and interest to the story.  But then we are faced with the choice of the topic, and this is no simple murder mystery.  In this book she deals with all the horror of things that human beings can do to one another, and strong medicine it is too.  As such, I have given this book 3 stars instead of 5 that I would normally have given for style and skill in narration.<br />The subject matter is vile.  There is prejudice, bigotry, hatred and violence in all of its ugly glory, and it sickened me.  I have read many books with equally graphic horrors without bother - perhaps it is a testament to Ms Walter's writing skills that it got to me so effectively.  The end of the book is utterly heart rending and shocking and stayed with me for days.<br />Well, you might say, it is a murder mystery.  Surely all such stories are ugly by definition?  Perhaps, but with this one Ms Walters has outdone herself, and despite her undoubted writing skills and ability to tell a tale, this is quite a difficult book to read and feel comfortable with.	2001-06-20

Her antics become so disastrous, that it is actually difficult to take it all in.  Just somewhere along the line, I needed her to have a break from all the havoc!<br />So whereas this is not what it seems, and it tries to hard to be funny, it may be appealing to readers who like a relatively fast paced book.  But it fell a little short for me.	2001-06-20
US	52872993	R3269BQMPIUHIU	0805064958	678676875	A Good House	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Really draws you in	This is a finely crafted novel about everyday people having everyday lives over a period of some 50 years.  The author looks at life, death, love, hate, injury and healing, and all in all does so in a simple prose that draws you in and makes you really care about what happens to the characters.<br />However, if I have one small criticism, it is that the book is simply not long enough to give all of the detail of the lives of the characters, and it is this which stops it from being a truly spectacular novel.  For instance we know that one of the children born will grow with some sort of physical or mental burden, but it is only hinted at until she is almost fully grown.  Perhaps this is what makes the book so tantalising - the prospect that more will be revealed later, but I found that there was often insufficient to whet the appetite.<br />But in the scope of the novel it is a small criticism, and it is well worth reading.	2001-06-19

It is finely written, and thought provoking, and has all the real flavour of biblical times and places.  But it is a novel of women, written by a woman, and in my opinion with the intention to be appealing to women.<br />I sought out the relevant passages in my Bible, and there they were, just the bare bones of the story as Dinah suggests at the beginning of her narrative.  But let me stress, this is the author's FICTIONAL fleshing out of that tale, and to all of those who may be looking for more, you will not find it.<br />What you will find is a riveting tale of women living and loving in difficult times, but coping with humour and wit and grace.  It is a very entertaining novel, and I recommend it.	2001-05-31

It is the story of immortality, and all the issues that will come with it.

Perhaps I just like completion at the end of my books, but this aside, it is a very good read.	2001-05-30

This in itself is surprising, seeing as how the author is NOT a 13 year old boy!<br />We follow Adrian through the trials and tribulations of his parents' marital conflicts, the angst of unrequited love and the heady pleasures of then attaining that love, and all the usual issues with being a boy in school with teenage acne.  A particularly funny scene is where the doctor assures Adrian that he is only suffering from acne, and that Lassa Fever is unlikely as he has not been to Africa recently.

It has the expected happy ending and is in all a satisfying read.<br />If I have one small criticism of the book, it is that on occasions you do wonder where the dialogue is all going.  And at times I became impatient for Renato to get on and do what he has to do in order to make the change to his and everyone's lives.  But this is a small criticism - it really is a very good book, and one I recommend.	2001-05-30

Steinbeck sure has a way with words!  The story itself is almost the stuff of soap operas - two brothers and a woman one of them marries, twin children abandoned by their mother (the aforementioned woman) who becomes a madam, and a wonderful Chinese character who is never quite what he seems.  But what a wonderful story it is!<br />The characters are very well drawn, and Cathy is one of the best evil characters to fill the pages of a novel in a long time.

He takes us across many continents and interviews many people, throwing in anecdotes about his life and interests.<br />However what stops me giving this book a 5 star rating is the fact that I feel that some of the topics are given superficial treatment (despite the lengths of the chapters), and there is too much emphasis on the author's own involvement.  Fair enough, you might say, it is his book about his experiences, but I feel it is these experiences which should take central stage.<br />This is however only a small criticism, and it is a VERY interesting book, about interesting people in interesting times.	2001-02-14

We have well drawn and defined characters, beautiful countryside and exotic locations, and the usual measure of heartache, angst and happiness.<br />However if I have a criticism, and it is a very small one, it is that there are occasions where the characters simply don't quite gel in their relationships with each other.  The grand passions presented fall just a little short of being as grand as they should be, and the novel is a little sadder because of it.

So I picked up this book with a great deal of anticipation.<br />I am pleased to say that this book is more than a worthy successor - if indeed successor is the right word.  Of course there is the carry over of some characters, but it is more of a sideways step than a straight out continuation.  It can genuinely hold its own if read without knowing &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot;.<br />It is a fine novel, well written and with an interesting and constantly moving plot.

I settled quickly into the tempo of the book, but was thoroughly disappointed with the details which pad out the story - the environment, the history of the times, the fine details of the characters.  This book is set in the scientific world of space exploration in the late 1950s, but it could be set anywhere, at any time.  The only real references to the background subject matter are the headers in italics at the beginnings of the chapters - the book is remarkably light on research - so unlike his other great books.<br />We follow the adventures of our hero who has lost his memory.  Unfortunately, he finds this out and sorts out his life with remarkably little trauma and ease.  He has a history of course, but even this colourful past is pat and unbelievable.<br />This is quite a weak story that kept me entertained enough to finish the book, but no more.

However it is peppered with enough interesting &quot;incidents&quot; from world history to make it worthy of a read even if you had no real interest in the subject matter.<br />It is reasonably technical, and may be considered &quot;heavy going&quot; by someome disinclined to tackle such a volume.  However it is still popular science, and takes a look at what are fundamentally interesting questions such as &quot;Why did some people develop steel weapons and others kept rock?&quot;, and the bits I find most interesting, &quot;Why did some societies have the really evil germs and others not?&quot;.<br />All in all it is easy enough to read to be of interest to almost anyone.

The birds gather and attack in more and more numbers as the story progresses, and the tale details the fear the family feels and the lengths they must go to to save their own lives.

This novel is all letters- letters exchanged between someone who is interested in old classic books, and someone who sells them.  What could be more dreary and dry I hear you asking yourself.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  What the story really chronicles is a story of a shared passion that becomes a friendship, and in reality an unspoken mutual admiration and eventually love over a 20 year period.<br />It is simply delightful, and the use of the letters as a way of telling the story means that it is different and innovative way of telling the story.  Enjoy!	2001-01-19
US	52872993	R2LJ6SD0CG8JYK	006092988X	892654736	A Tree Grows in Brooklyn	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Magnificent novel	There have been many memoirs of sad and deprived childhoods on the market lately (most notably &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; by Frank McCourt, which is very good), but this magnificent novel is far superior to any of them.  It is fiction, but it reads like a memoir and is told with an innocence that tugs at your heart.<br />We come to identify very closely with the characters and their deprivations, and rejoice when they do, and sorrow when they do.  It paints a picture of poverty in a city that had a booming economy that makes you feel guilty for having a comfortable home with plenty to eat.  And yet it does not intend to be a confronting novel - it is easy to read and is truly entertaining and heart warming.<br />It is one of the best books of its type, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.	2001-01-19
US	52872993	RU3ZCQCJNT9QI	0380730405	39495389	Rebecca	Books	5	2	2	N	N	One of my favourite books	This is an interesting book in many ways, but what makes it really different to many others is that we never, ever find out the name of our heroine, who narrates the tale, and the Rebecca who gives her name to the title is dead before the story begins.  Thus is the scene set for a fabulously dark and brooding mystery.<br />The characters are wonderful.  We have our nameless heroine, her distant husband Max, whom she loves to distraction, and the malevolent housekeeper Mrs Danvers, who was devoted to Rebecca, the dead but original lady of the house.  And the house itself, beautiful Manderley, with fabulous gardens and deep dark mysteries.<br />It really is a delicious read, good for a stormy night, and despite the tortured relationships and scenarios throughout the story it has a surprising but very satisfying ending.  It is a classic, and deservedly so.	2001-01-19
US	52872993	R1I9W6OBG47QAT	1558586113	328437470	Canterville Ghost, The	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Deliciously funny	Oscar Wilde was the master of witty and amusing stories, and this little novella is no different.  It tells the tale of the poor Canterville Ghost, whose very existence is made miserable by a family of Americans who not only do not believe in him (despite his best efforts at terrorising him), but who do unspeakable things like removing the eternal blood stain in the library.<br />The American family are really well drawn with the children being particularly successful in making the ghost miserable.  And the ghost himself - well, we find ourselves having some symapthy for him, and the end of the story is quite poignant.<br />It is a wonderful story for an older child, but also for an adult.  It is certainly one of my all time favourites.	2001-01-17

He is cute and furry, he has been rescued from certain death by his humans, and best of all he fights snakes in a land where they are an everyday part of life - and death.<br />This is not just a story for children.  The writing is sophisitcated enough to appeal to adults and is very funny in parts, and very touching in others.  But it is a great story to share with children - it touches on all the things we want for our kids - strong and loyal friends, a protective and supportive family, and the ability to know when its time to stand up for yourself, and take risks if you need to.<br />It is a really wonderful story (as are all of Mr Kipling's - to be fair) but this is quite a masterpiece.  Share it with a special child and enjoy it all the more.	2001-01-16

But what most people don't appreciate is what a fine novel this is - it is absolutely riveting, and we really become involved with the diverse set of characters in what is in reality only a few hours.<br />If you like a great read that will keep you turning the pages, and holding your breath, you'll love this.  It may be out of print but do look for a copy - it will be worth it.	2001-01-15

The other characters are introduced and we become interested in them as well. But somehow it just runs out of steam from there, and by the end I was simply pleased to be finished (I confess I did finish because I am one of those people who perservere unless a book is truly atrocious).<br />Overall I was very disappointed.  It is evident that Edding's still has the gift as the characters are well cast and interesting, but the battles are too long, and by the end I didn't care what happened to any of them.<br />Stick to his earlier, far superior works.	2001-01-15

It is a classic of the genre, and is still believable and interesing today.<br />The characters are well drawn, and the science is detailed and interesting.  I guess it is comparable to a good old fashioned disaster story, and it is this element that would make the story appealing even to those who don't care for science fiction.<br />Arthur C Clarke has always been a great writer, and this is a wonderful story.  It will keep you riveted until the very end.	2001-01-15

In fact I read it in one sitting - you know how this happens - I'll just see what happens in the next chapter and before you know it you've finished!<br />Michael Chrichton has done a believable job in painting sexual harrassment in the workplace, but with a bit of a twist.  It is very entertaining, and I recommend it highly.	2001-01-15

She is a woman who started her life with fire and promise, and who found herself in her kitchen talking to the walls.  Not because she is mad, but because her life is loveless, predicatable and dry. Until her friend takes her to Greece and her life changes, in many ways.<br />This is an absolutely delightful story.  We can all identify with Shirley and her need to have a life with a little more meaning, and we can all cheer her as she goes about getting it.  This is a poignant, sad and funny story, and it is a modern classic.	2001-01-15

The settings of England both during and after the war are well painted and realistic, and all in all the story really pulls you in and makes you care for the characters.<br />This is a lovely book to curl up with on a cold winter's night.  Reading Binchy books are like catching up with old friends!	2001-01-15

These are some of the best short stories in the world by the master of the genre.  The stories twist, they turn, they make you laugh and they make you gasp.  It is amazing how he can take stories of the usual and the normal and twist them into something very unusual and abnormal.<br />If you like your good literature in little bites, you cannot go past a great short story.

It has a snappy story line with a nicely complex plot, believable characters and a really good twisted ending (which I have to confess I had not anticipated).<br />This is one of those books which you pretty much end up reading at one sitting - you know the type, where you'll just read one more chapter before putting it down, and before you know it, you've finished.<br />A very enjoyable book, great for Mr Grisham's existing fans, and a good place to start for new ones.	2001-01-12

We are fortunate indeed that our history can be recorded in this way.<br />This is not the sort of book to leave on a shelf.  Leave it on a coffee table, on a sofa, or on a chair where it will be picked up and looked at with regularity.  It's not only educational - there are memories in there for all of us.  And being a Life book, they are the best pictures of all.	2001-01-11

It is an excellent scholarly overview of the lives and times in the period it covers, but as well it is a fascinating book for anyone who enjoys reading about times past.<br />Each chapter addresses an area that was of interest to women of the times, and remain of interest today - health, cooking etc, and they are so complete in addressing the issues that they read like small essays on their own.<br />This is a really enjoyable book, and not just for its scholarly value.	2001-01-11

Her trials and tribulations, erratic love life and great passion make this a tale that fairly races along and keeps the reader interested.<br />In addition, Ms Windsor has her historical details right as well - something that I always look for, and she paints the brightness of Reformation England with as much life and vigour as it must have had at the time.<br />If you want a great historical romance, here it is.  Unashamedly a book for a lazy weekend of indulgence!	2001-01-10

Andy Warhol was the ultimate party animal, and his observations of the people he partied with and the places he partied at are witty and insightful.<br />But hey the gossip is great!  Lots of people were uncomfortable when this was published, and with good cause.  It is really quite revealing!<br />If you are interested in the arts scene of the times this is a really revealing book.  If you like a good gossip this is for you.  Enjoy Mr Warhol's 15 minutes of fame!  He appeared to.	2001-01-10

I didn't really get what I was expecting.<br />To start with the actual reading of the book is fairly heavy going.  The style of the text, with its arbitrary puctuation, takes some getting used to.  Secondly, the story is almost unrelentingly bleak.  Fair enough it was a dark time in the world, but even the flashback memories fail to offer any enlightenment to the story.<br />And the ending!  Well, I shan't give that away, but it left me very let down.<br />All in all it is an interesting book.  The story is worth reading, and it is a fascinating time in history where men and women did amazing things just to survive.  But it is not a pleasant story, and reading it is hard work.	2001-01-10

It jumps all over the place and it is difficult to keep track of the narrative.  It took me almost half the book to become used to this style, and by then we get to the very best bits - Ludo's diary and Ludo's adventures in school, which are hugely entertaining.<br />The characters are interesting, as are their familiy histories and circumstances, but these are also deeply buried in the odd narrative.<br />If you perservere with this book, you will be rewarded with some real gems of humour and style.  But I must say that you have to wade through some very different and distracting writing to get to these gems.	2001-01-09

It starts with a murder, which remians unsolved for many years, and goes on to follow the lives of the characters on that fateful day.<br />And it is the characters which carry the story, though of course we all want to know who did it, and we do find out by the end.  But the story along the way is gripping and entertaining, with some real baddies, and a satisfying ending.	2001-01-08

In these stories there are great characters, great plots and great endings with a twist.<br />The beauty of these stories are that they are short enough to read in one sitting, but just long enough to leave you wanting more.	2001-01-05

Sure its a story about a horrible subject - a murder, and set in horrible surroundings - a prison, but like &quot;Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption&quot;, the characters and the story shine through.  And like the &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot;, the story has a wonderful ending.<br />This was very enjoyable when released as a 6 part serial - I waited for every book.  But this book deserves to be in hardcover in every dedicated reader's library.	2001-01-05

Along the way we meet many of its rulers and marvel at their cruelty and compassion, great leadership and debauchery.  Its a great story, one never dreamt of in fiction, and one well worth reading.	2001-01-05

Of all of David Edding's great fantasy works, The Belgariad stands out as the best.  It has by far the most interesting characters, and yet they are &quot;human&quot; enough for us to be able to dientify with them.  Garion's adventures and realtionships are exciting and interesting, and certainly are entertaining enough to make you want to read all of the books in the series.  The plots also have lots of twists and turns, but true enough the apparently loose ends all come together at the end - a sure sign of a well crafted tale.<br />If you can find these books as a set, then buy it.  If not purchase them all as individual books - they are certainly worth it.	2001-01-05

Confused by all those strings on &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;?  Then this is the book for you.<br />It looks at all of the Beatles songs, in chronological order, and gives you little bits of insight into the stories, the logic and the madness that went into their creation.  In a sense it is the history of the Beatles from the music's perspective, and fascinating it is too!<br />I guess this is a little intense for anyone with a passing interest in the Beatles or the music of the 60s, but for the rest of us, it is a wonderful reference book.	2001-01-05

Ms Penman does a wonderful job in animating them for the modern reader.<br />There are adventures aplenty, like Maud escaping from a castle in a snow storm wrapped in a white cloak, as well as all the richly embroidered details of every day life you expect from a great historical novel.<br />Ms Penman is a great writer, as she showed so well with &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot;, and this is a great book.	2001-01-05

I'm more of a history fan.  And I guess that's why Dune is so appealing - it is a very well crafted science fiction novel, but because of the concept of the family histories, the trade wars and other issues it has the feel of a historical saga as well.<br />In addition there are great characters, inhospitable deserts, evil bad guys and giant worms.  What more could a person want?  But all in all its a real saga - a great book and a great read.  Science fiction fans rejoice, and those who wouldn't normally consider such a book will also enjoy it.	2001-01-04

Just don't leave it lying where their furry companion can find it - it may just give them some ideas!

His life, which he yearns to be boring and normal, is a reader's delight, from his unorthodox conception to the trials and tribulations of his marriage.<br />But this book is not just about Garp, it is about finding the unusual in every day things, about rejoicing in sadness and about making the best of what you have.  It is a truly delightful book, and I rank it just as highly as I do Irving's other great masterpiece &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meaney&quot;.  I don't like all of Irving's books, but this is wonderful, and it should be on everyone's &quot;must read that someday&quot; list.	2001-01-04

This is a great reference book for those who want to check on the highlights of each President's term, but I found it somewhat lacking in details.

But I perservered because the subject matter interested me, and I was amply rewarded.  It is a novel which makes you count your every day blessings, and it is a novel which will make you look at things you take for granted in an entirely new light.<br />As the novel progresses you do come to identify with the characters and their trials and tribulations.  Some of the issues it addresses are shocking.  It is also very sad.  But it is a well crafted novel.<br />I feel that it loses some of its momentum in the final chapters after their &quot;escape&quot; from the Congo, but this is only a small criticism, and the novel is pulled together nicely by the last chapter.<br />This is a difficult novel to read at several levels, but this is also a very good novel, and well worth your time.	2000-11-29

The author states at the beginning of the book that he didn't wish to make up conversations and thoughts for the various ill fated men who people his book, and it is this cold and clinical distance that makes the book the riveting tale that is is.  But at the same time the thoughts and memories of the people who loved them are touching and sad, and it gives the book an additional depth that it would otherwise have lacked.<br />It is a very cleverly written book, on a topic that you wouldn't think would have universal appeal, but it is a book you should read nonetheless.  You won't forget it.	2000-11-13

I think it is a lovely opportunity for a little escapism,  in the warmth of an Italy that many of us will never have the good fortune  to experience.  So what if it is somewhat of a self oriented story that  makes little mention of the people?  It is a gentle and interesting story,  and I have enjoyed it thoroughly.	2000-09-19

It is  certainly entertaining enough in a gentle way, but only as an average  romance, and nothing else.  Even there it begins to flounder, as I found  myself unconvinced of the growing feelings between the characters, and  found the ending to be flat and quick, almost as if she had run out of  ideas.<br />If you are reading this review, please do not be put off - Pilcher  is one of my favourite authors and I would rate all of her other books 4 to  5 stars.

I first purchased this book nearly 20 years ago, and each time I re-read it I find new and fascinating things within.  There is no doubt that this  is a meticulously researched and crafted novel, and we all learn to  identify with the waif Ayla as she struggles to survive with her new  family.<br />However I must say that even though I have read and enjoyed all  the books in the series so far (one just has to know how Ayla is faring!),  this is by far THE strongest and best. The characterisations are strong,  and the trials and tribulations of the clan believable.  Please don't be  put off by the success of the series, this book is a gem which can more  than stand by itself.	2000-09-15

What is particularly appealing is the way each character  unfolds their story as their pilgrimage progresses, with each story very  different but equally as interesting.  The world of the future is painted  as vivid and believable, though I do agree with some other reviewers who  have commented that the author appears to be totally obsessed with John  Keats.<br />A final comment - don't bother reading Keats' poem  &quot;Hyeprion&quot; if you are not already familiar with it - it sheds  little light on the complexity of the novel.<br />Over all it is a rich,  detailed and enjoyable epic, great for escapism and one which I thoroughly  recommend.	2000-09-12

My great  passion is reading, not getting dirty in the garden, but she thought that I  would still share her enthusiasm.<br />To a certain extent I do, and it is  certainly full of warm and witty stories and anecdotes relating to the joys  of gardening.  But it is just that which has failed to hold my attention.  It is about gardening.<br />If you can find a copy for a gardening friend, or  if your greatest joy is planting, weeding and identifying obscure flowers,  you will adore this book.  If not you will still appreciate its warm  humour.<br />A nice book, which could be truly wonderful, depending on your  ties with the garden!	2000-09-12

However it evolves around a  shocking accident, and more than once I was reduced to tears. But many of  Pilcher's books have sadness in them - perhaps this is part of their charm.  If I have any criticism of the book, it is that it was surprisingly  predictable, and indeed all that I thought would happen did in due course.  However, this is a very small criticism, and I must say I enjoyed it  despite the sadness.  Pilcher's books can be read and reread again, and it  is just like having an old friend to visit.	2000-08-24

This is Wilde's best play, it is fast moving, has wonderful characters  (especially the women), and funnily enough is still a pretty accurate  observation of society.  Perhaps nothing ever really changes!  At the core  of the play is the name Earnest, and all that it means to the various  characters, and how their white lies and complicated lives catch up with  them.  And the lines - wonderful ones like &quot;I always carry my diary -  a lady should always have something scandalous to read on the train&quot;,  and &quot;if you are not too long, I shall wait for you forever!&quot;.  Be  assured, all works out well in the end, and all shall be revealed as to how  important it is to be Earnest.	2000-08-07

The Angel Xas is definitely the centre of the story,  but (and perhaps foolishly) I expected a gentler and more angelic  character.  So if you're looking for the standard story of beautiful angels  with wings that smell of snow, this is not for you.  That aside it is still  an engrossing and clever read, and I do recommend it.	2000-08-07

Having said this it is certainly an  entertaining book, and the sub plot of his obsession with hedges is  different, but all in all I think Larry is a guy we can all identify with,  and Ms Shields does a very good job of making us care what happens to him.	2000-07-11

It has all the usual grandeur of his other works, but maybe because it is a history of an area about which I  know so little, I find the story utterly mesmerising.<br />There are of course  elements of the story that we are familiar with, such as the horror of war,  but even with the grand historical elements that Mr Michener weaves so well  into his tales, I think it is the characters that hold the narrative  together.  And I think that this novel has the strongest and most  believable characters of all his works.<br />The story and the lineage of the  main characters flow wonderfully, and all in all, it is a very satisfying  book.	2000-05-05

It covers all the great eras and great works with beautiful plates, and the accompanying text is detailed enough to satisfy the most  curious reader.

This is not to say that it  skips over the subject matter - this is definitely not the case, but there  is not the detail needed for in depth scholarly analysis.<br />But as a  general reference book on a complex and fascinating topic, it is a gem.

All the  interesting things are there - Paul meeting John, the American tour, Apple,  break up etc, and fasinating it is.<br />If you like their music or damn them  as madness from the 60s, the fact remains that they were hugely influential  in areas ranging from pop music to advertising, and this book paints the  picture very well.	2000-03-23

Seduced by the rave reviews and awards that this book has gathered, it was with the anticipation of a great read that I began the story.  I am sorry to report that it is a difficult read and even though I perservered until  the end I am still unsure how our heroine fares.  The interspersing of  information about Australia's great trees is interesting enough, but not  enough for me to rate this book more highly.  I was very disappointed.	2000-03-17

The images and plates are wonderful, though I feel that the text drags a little and sometimes I  feel that Mr Hughes has lost some of his passion for commentary.  If you  would like a far more informative text about art, and American modern art  in particular, check out his earlier and far better work &quot;The Shock of  the New&quot;.	2000-03-16

The adventures of Ms Jones continue much as they did in the first book, with her usual trials and tribulations and quests for eternal love.  I consider myself a modern woman, and I laugh at Bridget, but the things  Helen Fielding writes are very easy to identify with.  Do yourself a favour  and read both of her books.  Everyone needs a little laughter in their  lives.	2000-02-29

The stories all have  common ties, and the ending is marvellous, even poignant.  A thoroughly  entertaining read, and a valued addition to my library.	1999-09-16

However, I find that this story also has a dark under current, which is a little different to  her other books. But as a slice of life in modern Ireland, with characters  you laugh and cry with, it is a fabulous read.  And best of all, this book  also gave me a good friend in another country - all the more reason to  cherish it.	1999-09-10

After a while, the adventrues of Sigtrygg in his efforts to secure his rights had me  completely enthralled.  Beneath the research and the meticulous attention  to detail there is still the old fashioned &quot;good guys against bad  guys&quot; story that we all know and love.<br />In addition there is the  sweep of drama, the dark forrest, the adventures on the high seas,  beautiful women, clashing swords and all manner of excitement.  It is a  great read, and it also has a most satisfying ending.<br />Well done Stuart,  but what next?	1999-08-18

The writing is good, but the characters have lost their way and the story  itself is thin and unsatisfying.

Studentsof history will appreciate it as it is almost (but not quite) likereading from the source documents, and it gives the characters really strong identities without romanticising them the way so many authors are tempted to.  Although it is out of print it is worth seeking a pre-loved copy.  You won't regret it.	1999-08-06

It details the horrors of war and the inhumane conditions POWs were forced to face, but it also is a carefully crafted tale of friendship, and how people can thrive in the most unlikely  places.  I disagree with the reviewer who thinks it is a depressing book -  it is a novel of the human spirit, with a dash of good old capitalism  thrown in for good measure.<br />Again, it is a wonderful book.

It is both graphic and  wittty, poignant and savage, and it leaves you wishing there was more to  the story than you are given.

Like all stories relating to the holocaust it  is disturbing and I found myself thinking of the story long after I  finished reading it.  But I also wanted more - I wanted to know more about  both of the major characters, and what drove them both.  I wanted more of  the history, horrifying and disturbing though it is.  I wanted to identify  with them both because what makes a truly great book is the ability to  absorb the reader into the story.  It is a very good book, but it just  falls short of being a great book.	1999-03-05

My young daughter is similarly interested, and this is a great book for someone &quot;starting  out&quot; with an interest in ancient times.  It looks at all of the famous  sites in archaeology, as well as the different eras.  In addition it looks  at themes as recent as the study of the industrial era, showing that  archaeology is not just ancient bones and bits of pottery.  For those who  want more detail it is probably a little sketchy, but for the average  household it is an excellent reference book.	1999-03-04

I have read it several times but somehow I have never made it through the last chapter without  tears in my eyes - but they are tears almost of relief and happiness for  the character Tom, who is healed as the book progresses.

It is a magnificent book, a true achievement, but I would caution anyone who  reads it to have a glossy book of the actual works on hand for reference.  Nothing more frustrating than not knowing what they all look like!

The spoonerisms in some tales are magnificent - some stories are real laugh out loud material.  But there is still a streak of  the dark and brooding Lennon, which occasionally cuts into the comic  genius, and makes you look at him in a different way.  This is a valuable  book for anyone who seeks to understand one of the great musical influences  of our time, and also one if you're looking for a good giggle!	1999-03-02

This is a fabulous rich and detailed novel, which keeps you guessing with its intricate family details and horrors.  I especially like the way the stories of the past witches are told through the records of the Talamasca.  I am not fond of the folllow up novels, and feel this can stand alone, but I urge anyone who loves reading to take this novel and lock themselves away somewhere quiet for a while!	1998-05-19

This was referred to me by a friend, and as a compulsive devourer of books I took it with good grace.  I read it while holidaying in South East Asia and loved every bit, as did my husband.  You will not be disappointed	1998-05-19
