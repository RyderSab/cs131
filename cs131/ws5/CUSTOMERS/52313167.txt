I am waiting for this book for a very long time. And at last we have the complete collection, burned in 2 disks. My question is,<br /><br />Since the editors determined to publish such a valuable collection, why the resolution of the image is so low? Why not make a really pleasant collection? I am a bit angry with that, since for those cartoons with small fonts, the texts are almost illegible. And the low resolution lost all the fine touch of the cartoonist. Alas.	2004-12-17

It moves me so much that Coetzee honestly record his struggle, love and desire and look into his heart, his self-contempt and self-esteem. Living a hopeless and routine life, at the same time our protagonist did not forget his poem, his dream of becoming a great poet in the obscure future. The whole book prevails an heartbreaking narcissistic atmosphere, but is sincere. The cordial sound makes this book moving and convincible, and we understand a melancholic soul in his adolescence.<br /><br />However, this book ends suddently and surprisingly, without any conclusion. At first sight I am surprised, but after some contemplation, I know it is DOOMED to be so. Because in the real life Coetzee, after the age of 24, begun studying in US, and then got a phd, then taught in a college, then wrote fictions, then became famous, then got many award, include the Nobel. So what Coetzee could do if he wanted to continue the story? He could not record faithfully since after that year his life was much more smooth and satisfying than before (at least he was studying literature rather than math or cs), on the other hand he even could not fabricate a struggling life since the fiction is almost a autobiography.<br /><br />So, readers should not anticipate any finale, good or bad, in this book. The prose is beautiful, elegant and like poetry. The story is sincere, the author is sincere, the atmosphere is then superb. And that worths.	2004-09-30

I don't care about Anna, even I feel sorry for her and I know she is the prima donna, and oh yes there is a lot of to say about her and about the society etc. What I really care is Levin, who, in my opinion, is the TRUE protagonist of this book.<br /><br />In a sense Tolstoy wrote himself in Levin, a man who was always struggling for identifying and appreciating himself, for seeking reconciliation between the (erudite, rotten and hypocritical) noble and (uneducated but sincere) ordinary people, for finding an appropriate and a correct position of himself, and for searching the meaning of life. The journey of Levin is the journey of Tolstoy, and I am happy that at last he got some answer and find the peace.<br /><br />Just think about this. At the same time Levin despised the high society but he himself benefited a lot from his identity as a member of it. Hmmm, for a man of conscience it cried for deep pondering. This was the starting point of the journey of Levin. He was the conscience of Russia, and hence we know Tolstoy was the conscience of Russia.<br /><br />The book is such a classic and such a thick book that I never dared to read it. I thank Oprah for her selection that urged me to finish this tome.	2004-08-30

Rushdie lectured the motto in this tome: the life story of anyone can be the result of the whole world, and the whole world can be nothing but triggered by or explicited on someone. This is a historic fiction with fantasy, and a great fiction in its own.<br />Rushdie is so ambitious that he tried to depict the history of India in a book, in a very gorgeous language and style, while simaltaneously ruthlessly burdening our poor good protagonist, Saleem, and his morbid family.<br />I am so dazzled by the ambition and the language of the book, and am deeply moved not only by the book itself but also Rushdie. I can feel the ardent love and eager struggle for India in Rushdie. It is definitely not for the faint-hearted. And I am so happy that I finally finished this book.

Yes, it is a point, but not the whole point. Even those emphasizing on the linear and unplausible plot do miss a point Atwood wants to say.<br />In a way this is not only a sociologist's fantasy or an ecologists's fear, but also a literator's tremble and an etymologist's lamment.<br />Fungible, pullulate, pistic, cerements, trull. Windlestraw, laryngeal, banshee, woad. I don't think there will be many readers who recognize all of these words without looking up the dictionary. If the disappearance of these words is natural, why not other words?<br />Only after that can we know Jimmy, a man of literature-oriented, doomed to be a useless junk in a science-is-the-supreme-criterion world.<br />This is the sorrow of Jimmy, and also the sorrow of Atwood.	2004-01-19

Believe me, all over the origami world are waiting for this book!<br />Origami nowadays has much much more than a recreation. After the serious and arduous study of experts, the theory of origami model design has long been established. In the eyes of expert, there is nothing which cannot be folded from a single sheet of paper, as Lang stated \\"Anything is possible in origami\\" in this book. However, so far there is no book about design models. Superfans (like me), and those who are not satisfied by only the models and diagrams, can only collect ideas from sparse and different websites, books and magazines(for example, taitadaen of Japan), and struggle on our own.<br />And now here is Lang's book. This book is for everyone who is interested in origami. If you are an expert, buy it. Read the philosophy, share the joy and follow the route of a real origami master. If you are a veteran folder, buy it. Learn how these wonderful models were designed, see why Lang's models are always among the best, absorb the technic and try to design your models. If you are a newbie, buy it. Fold the models inside and have joy.<br />Even you have nothing to do with origami, buy it owing to the COVER. The vivid frog and the incredible koi, with hundreds of scales and antennae, are both folded from a SINGLE paper without a cut.<br />(BTW, the figure 1.1, which demostrates 32 elephants, 2D/3D, from the side/front, of different folders, accidently misses the mischevous elephant of Jeremy, which is looked from the butt :) )<br /><br />Thank you, Dr. Lang!	2003-11-24

Both are trainer/leader/problem committe member of the national/IMO team for many years, and are really excellent and famous in the olympiad field.<br />Reader may ask that what this thin book will give in an age with numerous contest problems and with new training books appearing every year. The answer is &quot;the Insight&quot;. It is divided into 50 sections(topics), each section is a essay containing the analyzing several(3 to 6) related problems, usuall from easier to harder. These problems are carefully selected from the huge collection of problems in numerous mathematics magazines and contests.<br />This is the FIRST book in english to teach olympiad readers that how the problems are relating with each other, how a simple idea grows into a hard and beautiful problem, how to think in a higher point of view. However, the style of this book is rather relax and warm.<br />This is not a textbook nor a problem book, neither suitable for training owing to its form. It's for reading, appreciating, and for those teachers/students who have been familiar enough with the standard problems and tired of training sessions. If you want to know what a mathematical olympiad is, what a beautiful cute problem is, this book is for you.<br />This book is a pearl indeed.

US	52313167	RR76FG2FQLVCB	0716783169	6691219	Computer Algorithms	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Not bad.	To be fair, this book is not bad. Compared to the usually 1000+ pp. algorithms book, this one is neat and succint.  It offers a cleay structure demostrating the materials, focusing on the overall designing method. After the basic introduction and data structres, each one of the following chapters, namely titled as  Divide-&amp;-Conquer, Greedy, Dynamic, Search-Traversal, Backtracking, occupies one chapter in its own. These five chapters are the core part of the book.<br />After that, the authors turns to some deeper topics (FFT, NP, etc) and closing the book on the Pram, Mesh, Hypecube algorithm. This approach is different from the ordinary algorithm book.<br />I must say that the organization of the materials is very succint. It is at the same time the merit and the drawback. Indeed sometimes it is too succint to comprehend. The materials usually under the same chapter scatter among the chapters. for example, the various sorting algorithm. Readers should read the whole book to learn these technic.<br />Even the exercise lacks the easier ones to convince the students in learning. (regardless the exercises of the first section (to look up a dictionary for the meaning of &quot;algorithm&quot;, et al. ) The FIRST EXERCISE of the whole book is to DESIGN AN ALGORITHM ABOUT HORNER's RULE AND ANAYLYZE IT. It's gone too far and incredible. (No wonder some students dislike the book...)<br />BTW, I find myself appreciating the decent typeset and the pseudocode system used in this book.	2003-01-20

This is an excellent training source in combinatorics for mathematics olympiads and contests.<br />Problems in this book are divided into 2 sets, with each set containing 51 problems. Problems in the first set are introductory ones (hence, relatively easy), and that in the second set are advanced problems (And harder, much harder indeed in the last few problems). Problems are very well selected and carefully organized according to their difficulty and technic involved. They span from the very easy first some enumerative problems to the really hard IMO-level, even notorious National-MO problems. Moreover, problems are up-to-date hence it avoids well-known cliche problems. The book is published in the end of 2002, and in this book some of the 102 problems are selected from the IMO that year!<br />As a regular lecturer of Taiwan's IMO team, I highly recommend this problem book.	2003-01-13

To be fair, the story worths -- it tells a story about how one find himself and start a new life. Yes, a bit cliche, but it does contain good paragraphs and good characters, and in these parts Irving is a master.<br />But the jokes and black humor are always repeated and repeated and repeated and make you feel tired and disgusting and sometimes make you pity for Irving. Since line by line I can imagine clearly how Irving sneer at and contrive deliberately and satisfied with his words in front of his desk. I often wonder, why an excellent and natural author in the &quot;The cider house rules&quot; falls into such a self-contained bad-taste humor so deeply?<br />Anyway, I will still read former books of Irving (The world according to the Garp, etc), since they are wildly and widely acclaimed.

Such technic has been developed into a wildly splended state, for example, see books of Lewis Simon or Tokomo Fuse. However, in this book Montroll still insists on his long-time philosophy-- one single square paper, two hands, nothing else.<br />The best part of this book, in my opinion, is the 5 Plato polyhedras plus the 5 sunken Plato polyhedras, all folded by a single square paper. This is a succint approach, although not new. And the intrinsic beauty of these models explains everything. Other parts of this book are fair enough, for example, prisms and other models are relatively new compared to other polyhedra origami books.<br />Since every model is folded by one square, it seems that we can not hope to have some super-complex models. After all, the special symmetry structures of polyhedras do hinder the design of the folding-- in order to keep symmetry it will waste too much paper. So it is a pity for those super-hard-model-addicts.<br />BTW, I am happy that after so many years Montroll finally comes to Mathematics!	2002-04-18

This book is too short-- 3 parallel stories went simultaneously, and none was fully told. And This book is too long-- since we knew these three tories must related to each other and indeed was a story, the main stream went so slow that sometimes I lost my patience.<br />It's frustrating that after more than 300 pages I still could not catch the main theme of this novel. I believe this WAS the devise of Atwood, but still the feeling of uncertainty annoyed me. While after 500 pages I finally could depict what I thought the story was, or should be.<br />Then a SURPRISE! The truth was so amazing, some even were in the opposite to my prediction. So the whole novel has a new meaning  and deserved/needed a re-read, in the new light. Such reaction must have been controlled by Atwood, and she designed it really well.<br />In addition to the plot, the prose was so good that some passages read like poems. Some sentences were that special that I adore the imagination of Atwood.<br />The most disadvantage of this book, in my opinion, is the some-what one-dimension personality of the characters. Reenie was kind, Laura was passionate, Iris was dark, Richard is pale, Freddie is noisy, etc. It will be better if Atwood add some conflict essence to each of these characters.<br />Anyway it needs a patient reader, and is a good book indeed.

As a frequent lecturer of Taiwan IMO team, I have many many MO books. Most of the books available are well-written by professionals and excellent mathematicians. However, since IMO does really prevail in recent years, these authors could not be the participants themselves (^^). Furthermore, usually these books (except those are merely problems collections) contains a good proportion of &quot;harder&quot; and beautiful problems, and the easier and basic training problems are relatively few. It often get the beginners frustrate.<br />Now this maybe is the first book written by a member of former MO team, and now a training lecturer. (The author himself won the USAMO and IMO in 1974, and helped train several USA IMO teams, including the 1994 &quot;perfect score team&quot;). So here is the precious experience!

But no, this is not mere an travel writing. This book reflects the India, or the third worlds, in Naipaul's eyes. On the whole this reflection is a mixture of pity, wonder, alas, and disgust.<br />It is interesting to know the fact, as Naipaul stated in the book, that his ancestors came from India (And that's why he made this journey). And you will know all the pity, wonder, alas, and disgust mentioned above come from deeper feelings: confusion of identification, shame to accept one's root, struggle between despair and hope.

During this period so many things happend, some were controlled by themselves (their creation Escapist, their feats on the  Golden age of Empire Comic), but a lot of time they were only shaped, could not help but, and changed by the surrounding. The plot and the skill were quite excellent-- The whole 600+ pages just surrounded a word &quot;Escape&quot;. In a sense, owing to the war-time and their personalities, each charater in this book tried their own way to escape the reality. But in fact they could do nothing but were inevitably altered by the time and the era. The only &quot;charater&quot; who really escaped was the Golem, in the form of a box of sand (how ironic). The struggle and the helplessness of human, in my opinion, was the most memoriable part of this story.<br />And The story was so vivid-- In fact I browsed the searching-engine for many times during my reading session, in order to make sure if the statements in this book was real, or only fictitious. Both two main charaters were quite real and almost tangible. The image of Joe and Sam were very strong.<br />And Chabon's language was so extraordinary that the beautiful words and sentences and paragraphs poured toward me all through the book. In fact the language in this book maybe was the most beautiful one among many books I've read in recent years.<br />BTW, this book testifies the high standard of the Plitzer award. Highly recommended.	2001-09-10

This is the only origami book make you laugh to tears.<br />All models here are folded from a single square, no cut. The author emphasize this philosophy, and wrote a quite clear essay about it and encourge the folder-reader to become designer.<br />Followed are a lot of wonderful models. Besides the very excellent models &quot;Swiss knife&quot;, &quot;Nail clipper&quot;, etc, and extraordanary models: man swapper, man on the surf, eight interwine ring, eagle balanced on the tip of the mountain (both folded from dollar bill)  etc, there are many funny models:<br />An elephant from behind (so only butts and tail, and tip of nose), a walking man(when spread and flatten the whole paper, the creases become a labyrinth.) One I appreciated most is the &quot;Origami square&quot;, fold as followes: Take a Square paper, rotate and rotate and rotate and flip and rotate and rotate, then VOILA, the origami square completes. (I got angry and very happy at the same time when I read this). Moreover, a invisible duck, a car with tires replaced by 4 legs....<br />The author is so versatile and desperately funny, joyous atmosphere prevails the whole book. Highly recommended.	2001-07-06

I could picture their daily life, sensed their emotions, their struggles and understood their own ways when facing situations or difficulties of life. Each one thought and acted in a different logic according to their personalities, making this fiction very vivid. I could even felt the feature and the sound of Tanneke, Maria Thins, Catharina, Vermeer, Pieter, etc. And I want to slap Cornelia too.(In fact, at the end Griet slap her again, I was very happy and laugh out)<br />Unlike some books with deliberately contrived or hidden plots, Chevalier's were naturally put between pages, and her excellent writing skill was well and neatly placed here and there and gradually emerged before readers. Readers could comprehend and understand these skill, not to felt too contrived. For example, the eight-point-star square. At first it seemed unimportant, but when I read Griet standing on the center to choose a point, each point led to a different life, I was deeply moved. Just mention some another examples: the two slaps given to Cornelia (the welcome and good-bye to this family), the first sight of bloody finger of the butcher(and at last she become his wife); the pearl ring given back to Griet, combined with the debt Vermeer owed to them; the day when Agnes died followed by Fran's birth. Such designs and metaphors prevailed the whole book, making this book a joy to read.<br />Usually many books have good beginning and loose ends, But this book is different. At first it seemed a bit slow and cold, even a bit detached. But page after page readers would know that's because this book just followed the tone of the protagonist, Griet, maid and muse of Vermeer. It's tranquil but always affirmative. Gradually clues and scenes combined into a full bloom and it was quite wonderful.<br />This book is a pearl. Highly recommendend.ighly recommendend.	2001-04-04

A *well-known* detective childishly believed that after 20 years he can come back to Shanghai to save his missing parents in the specific house. After 20 years?!! And the most stromg weapon of the detective is his magnifying glass. A magnifying glass?!<br />I *GUESS* that Ishguro wants to make the cynic and pompous and paranoid part of Chris Banks gradually known by readers. But is it so? I doubt. The personality of Banks is unnatural and contrived and without any logic. Sometimes normal, sometimes childish, a lot of time getting paranoid. Even So, I still think Ishguro's skill far from mature to fulfill it.<br />Then, Ishguro has not enough ability to handle such a theme in such an enviroment. Set mainly before the WW2 in Shanghai, the stories indeed acrosses more than 50 years, and scenes sparsed in different places in Shanghei and England. On the whole this novel is a bad mixture of war, detective, crime, family, traitor, sex, gang, communists..., and trying to write everything results in nothing.)<br />The whole story is never, never persuative. The writing style shattered (on purpose), and without structure. Many scenes apparently deliberatly contrived. Yes, some sections worth read, for example the childhood live. But most of this book it is a waste of time.<br />Some scenes are quite ridiculous and make me laugh and very angry. Laugh at the author who simplified the scenes and human in Shanghei; Angry about myself why struggling to finish it.<br />Oh, what a amazing &quot;magnifying glass&quot;, what a welcomed Christopher Banks, how naturally the lieutnant followed him without hesitation. These plots exists only in comics. My last question, it is one of the shortlists of Booker?!	2001-03-20
US	52313167	R1CKEJYPYSAL9K	0060930861	901054422	Cloudsplitter: A Novel	Books	5	1	2	N	Y	Audacious, Ambitious tome for patient reader.	This book was so ambitious and audacious, ambitious on trying to rewrite the history of John Brown, audacious on trying to have the story recounted by the 3rd son, Owen Brown, of John Brown. Since we knew that Owen was a real person in history indeed, this book did offend Owen in a sense, by making Owen paradoxical, both cruel and sympathic, bold and coward.<br />The design of letting this book related by Owen, in my opinion, is both the best and the worst design. Best in the vivid descriptions of Brown family's life that when you really being drawed into it, you felt you WERE living with them at the same time, in the same place, breathing the same air, sharing the same event and mood. And worst, since we ALWAYS knew it was in fact not true, Owen's personality was not true, the result was that I could not help but being conscious how Banks made his Owen to be reasonable and natural in every scene and how to make Owen's sound plausible.<br />Banks himself stated in the preface that this book was a mere fiction. But even on the historical level this book had many errors, time rearranged, scene apparently contrived, etc. But let's forget all these, be regardless the doubt between the real history and the contrived Owen. Then this book was indeed a very good book.<br />The main theme was J.B, surely, his obsession, his paranoid about setting the black people free. But the struggle of the mind of Owen, namely the relation of father-son was another main topic Russel want to write. Since Russel treated both these 2 issues in much detail, this book became a huge tome. And both themes were quite convincible and successful. In my opinion the Father-son struggle was the most valuable part of this long epic. How a son lived under the shadow of the FatherGiant. (The meaning of the title &quot;Cloudsplitter&quot; did not reveal after some 400 pages, it is a name of the mountain, and in Indian it mean &quot;The Giant&quot;. At the same time it mean &quot;to split the cloud. So it is a triple pun. A good title indeed)<br />For any non-american reader like me, John Brown was but a unfamiliar name. I in fact knew nothing about John Brown and nothing about his historic position and his famous Haper ferry raid before reading this book. So in the beginning I faced some difficulties on following the story--The author had assumed that the readers already knew it. And as if Russel want to confirm this, then the life-sketch of Brown's was laid out suddently in the very early pages. This WAS a writing style, but I was afraid that for some readers (me included), the whole story became instantly boring. All I had to do thereafter was to verify page by page the ending I already knew. But It's my personal reading habit, this book was ok indeed.<br />This was my first book of Banks, so I highly wondered that, was the language in this book the constant style of Banks? I found that the long, scattered, full-of-common sentences in the  WHOLE book seemed to mimic John Brown's speaking tone -- It WAS still a writing style, but sometimes I just felt the page-after-page constant long sentences were annoying. And it was another reason why this book is so big.<br />Another, Banks tried very hard to explain the state of mind of Owen. And since we ALL know it is not real, Banks faced some difficulties too. For example, the Haper Ferry raid. In order to make Owen coldly observed their gangs being killed below, Banks must at first make Owen to be a cold-blood guy. So we had the The Epps story, the maid on the ship story, the fight in Boston story, etc. of Owen, to reinforce that. That did rationalized the cruelity of Owen. But this was still another reason to make the book so huge.<br />My only one complaint: why Owen could survive after the falling from the treetop? Even if he was uninjured and could mount on a wagon, the roads to their farm must had been blocked by so many troups. This part was too dramatic.  This book is a good and long journey for any amitious reader. Highly recommended.r. Highly recommended.	2001-03-02

For others, 3 stars.	I agree with Alan's review above, the title of this book is very misleading. When I first got this book I was quite disappointed that the designs here are not advanced. In fact, they are too easy to fold for advanced and experianced folders (for me they only ranked at too-easy to intermediate level). But just forget about it and then I find this book contains the richest practical origami models in a single book so far. These wonderful models are collected in the first half of the book. We can learn how to fold a purse, a clip holder, a booknote, a bookmarker, etc. In fact now my clipholder and bookmarker are folded as this book did by myself. In my opinion this part is this book's (true) merit. Models in the latter half are a bit trite and too easy. If you are interested on the practical usage of origami, this is a 5 star book. If not, this is only 3 stars. So take an average, 4 stars ^^	2001-02-05

His Step by Step origami is my first Lang book, and I am totally shocked. After all there are many wonderful book of Lang, each one climb unto a more higher stage. So I always doubt and wonder if Lang has his adolescent age in origami! And now this book is Lang's related simple work. According the publishing date (1992), This is STILL NOT an adolescent work, but it indeed contains easier models to fold. Some models are quite abstract, not as familiar Lang's style. It seems that Lang tried to make this book as easy as possible.<br />In fact this is a quite good origami textbook for true beginners and kids. It contains introduction of paper and notations then about 20 models, from 12 steps super easy and abstract grasshopper to complex(for some, intermediate) lion and gazelle.(Interesting enough, the gazelle use the base very like Montroll's dog's base). Although most models are simple, still there are some models both are abstract and beautiful, like ibex, gazelle and skate.	2001-02-05

Meanwhile Kathy happened to fell in love with deputy (married) Lester, and these 3 guys tried their own ways to get the possession of this house. Then numerous errors led to a total tragedy. Les accidently kindnapped the family, forced them to sold back the house. On their way for the sale Colonel's son, Esmail, errneously shot by other deputies; Furious colonel then (almost) strangled Kathy, then commited suicide with his wife. At last the whole Iranian family died, Kath and Les spend their rest life in jail.<br />I wept for the Iranian family, they were victims. I wept for their never-fulfilled American Dream. I felt both angry and compassionate toward the stupidity of Kathy. She is a good but foolish girl, and her bad reaction and foolish steps were half-forced by her fear of her family and her past. However I felt total angry about Lester. His reluctance for adimitting being defeated was the main reason of this tragedy.<br />Dubus's ability of depicting the inner state of every protagonist was superb. Every main charecter of this story ( Kathy, Colonel, Lester) was very vivid. I found myself sigh for every mistake they committed, but at the same time their wrong choices were inevitable, their action were comprehensible, according to their own past story, their own charecter and nature.<br />However, the pace of this book was not balanced. The first half too slow and the second too fast. The depicting style of the two parts of this book were differen. I wonder why Dubus insisted the story to be told only by Kathy and Colonel. Why not made Lez have his own voice during the second part? And the ending was quite suddent (just like cut in the middle) and a bit loose. The whole story ended without telling us the future of the house, the hearing, Kathy, Lez, Carol(Lez's wife), Kathy's family, etc.<br />But this book is a worth-read. Recommended.ook is a worth-read.

In this book, Ha Jin told us what was the real waiting&iexcl;XNeither Kong Lin's nor Manna's, But Shuyu's. As a silent and humble character, Shuyu was &iexcl;§naturally&iexcl;¨ forgotten by most readers. However, only patient readers could enjoy the ecstasy finding the surprising ending Ha Jin tried to tell us after the long read. At this point this book was very beautiful and successful &iexcl;V and sometimes a bit metaphorical, even philosophical --- hitting its climax, simultaneouly testing the readers and awarding those faithful. By design, we readers SHOULD wait patiently, waited for the ending. Impatient readers would never find the beauty and the true meaning of this story. In fact, since the pace of this book was so slow, the stories and scenerios during those 18 waiting years were repeated and predictable, I almost gave it up in the middle. But after I finished it, I was deeply moved and burst into tears. The book totally deserved it's reputation.<br />BTW, Why \\"18\\" years? Chinese, and only Chinese, knew that. It refered to an ancient folk tale of China. A woman (WANG BAU-CHUAN) waited for her husband (SHUE PING-KWEI), an officer, for \\"18\\" years in a shack, not knowing her husband had another lover in the army. This tale was so famous that almost every Chinese knew it. So we knew that Ha Jin tried to write a modern Wang-Shue tale. Each main character in the \\"Waiting\\" had its own corresponding character in the Wang-Shue story.<br />The only flaw in this book, in my opinion, was the chapter about Manna was raped. It read so cheap.	2000-11-02

In addition to beautiful or logical, It should be foldable-- after all, a dollar bill is so small. Montroll shows his readers here how versatile he is, and he is still a shining first-rate folder. How can he fold over 30 different animals in a tiny dollar bill. These vivid animals range from easy toucan, seahorse to intermediate tricertops, kangaroo to complex elephant, giraffe and camel.

I cried and laughed, laughed  and cried for this vivid epic. Set in a far obscure Congo village Kilango  about 40 years ago, this story read so vivid and true. I wept for all six  protagonists, for their fate and adherence. Especially Adah and Leah.  Kingsolver's power of describing the inner conflict of gifted children was  incomparable. Every so-called gifted educationist should scrutnize the life  story and the way of thinking of Leah and Adah (although this twin were  mere fictional!)<br />  In my viewpoints the best part of this epic lay on  the first two-thirds. With weaving scenes, african aroma, gorgeous language  witty, and different viewpoints,those chapters shone with bright sparkle.  Almost every section made me gasp. While from their Exodus this splendid  sound seemed fade a little. The pace and rhythm was too fast. After all,to  tell 25 years of stories of 3 different women in less 100 pages was not a  easy task. Often I found myself forgot &quot;how old are Leah(or any other)  now&quot;,and I must calculate once more. That's because the previous  adolescent images of these girls stamped on the reader so deep and firm,  they were too vivid to grow up. And sometimes I feel a bit annoying there  were too much polictical preachment in these pages. But on the last 50  pages the splendid and gorgeous flame flamed again. The close sections were  very beautiful and moving.<br />  This is truly a remarkable fiction.  Wholeheartedly recommended.	2000-09-12

First it introduces and  explains the original problem, than talk about it's history, how it does  connect with other branches of math, what these branches is about, and what  the other mathematicians do on this conjecture, and at last the most  exciting: how these results all bringed together and then solve this  20-year-long famous conjecture in combinatorics. There are exercises after  every chapter. so this is NOT merely a history survey (as most books do).  Indeed it is a textbook and contains some very excellent introductions to  some branches(for example, plane partition). And I think this is THE  correct style to populating mathematics--- Do not afraid of formulas, just  show readers the signs, the terrible formulas, show them how and what  mathematicians study and think! Every student major in mathematics should  read it, and it surely is a must-have for reseachers in combinatorics.	2000-05-30

This is not a book for learing how to fold an animal or something (in fact it contains only very few pages of diagrams). This book is a gallery of the  most striking original origami models of recent years. If you were not  familiar with today's origami development, you must be shocked when looking  at pictures here. And you will never believe that almost every model here  are folded by a single paper. For connoiseurs,this book is a must. My only  complaint is that, this book should have more pages!  Although some  well-known masterpieces justicially appear here (Lang's cuckoo clock,  Montroll's chessboard, Issei's Horse,etc); in my opinion, many masterpieces  still cannot share even a page (Maekawa's Devil, Kirschenbaum's Fluffy,  Engel's Octopus, etc.) I hope the author will publish vol 2!	2000-05-15

From the very beginning to the last page ,authors us that we  can make a proof clear by write out directly the algorithm or just make a  apparent bijection. The book contains 4 chapters, the first 2 stress on  basic enumeration objects and posets, the last 2 on bijection and  involution. With authour's carefully-selected topic and examples, this book  is self-contained. this book shows us the splendid new concepts of  combinatorics. I must say that I'm very happy and shocked that ,in such a  few pages ,by using combinatorical method developed here we can EASILY  prove Cayley's theorem, Vandemonde determinent, Roger-Ramanujan's partition  formula. etc. The exercises are excellent too. Very many good seed ideas  waiting to be developed.	2000-05-03

However, the most important part, the DETAIL MAP OF EVERY REGION and CAREFULLY ORGANIZED WALKTHROUGH are very, very disappointing. Especially the survey map of  every region, it's so slipshod!  It uses only one hint to indicate a lot of  regions and many houses, so a player get nothing and he MUST continuously  play his trial-and-error game to find a special house. The survey maps are  so small that you recognize almost nothing. Besides, how can a player use  fast key? how to learn magic more fastly? How does a player know this item  will be useful, or totally useless so he can sell it out immediately? These  are the most crucial points a player wants to know in a RPG game.

I use it accompanying with DG's Brahms complete edition, and the result is very informative and I totally enjoy it. The greatest merit,and at the same time  the crucial flaw, of this book is that this is a collaboration. Yes, good  enough, we can find different perspectives and different writing styles and  different standard among these articles. But even in the same category  pages seem not being equally distributed. For example, there are 4.5  enthusiastic pages dedicated to op.43,four lieder, with every lied in  detail. But there are only 3 paragraphs for op.46, four lieder. (It seems  rather &quot;unfair&quot;,isn't it? for op.46 is no less distinct then the  former.)

Almost every learner in this field learns this subject via scattered papers and chapters in different books or journels. The  apprearence of this book is so welcome by learners and researchers that it  offers a excellent introduction of this powerful and relatively new field.  Flajolet and Sedgewick are the famous masters of this field, and this book  proves that again. The writing style is succinct, with instant exercise(s)  after every important concept and result. The pace of this book is very  natural and self-contained. The first half of this book deals with the  basic tools used for analysis of algorithm, from the recurrence, generating  function, to asymptotic approx. Then it discusses 2 most crucial subjects:  trees and permutations. The last 2 chapter turns to strings and words. I  found it very readble that there is a typical and core example in every  chapter. BTW, since I still haven't finished studying this book, but I must  say that Chapter 5 (Asymptotic) is among many textbooks the best  introduction to this hard topic so far.	2000-04-01

It is succint and neat, without too many pages and too much content, while every facet of elementary complex analysis theory gets a chapter or two in it. It deals with power series first, then analytic fuctions, then  singular pts and residue theorem, then conformal mapping. After these basic  topic, it gives some futher theme like harmonic function and Riemann  mapping theorem. And the last with some chapters, including a topic on  proving prime number theorem, in application of the previous theorem. The  pace of this book is very natural, the exercises adequate and  well-selected. And in my experience, via this book students usually can  handle the most some important topics and get a good structure feeling of  this course. Highly recommended.	2000-01-10

The only (and  probably the crucial) disappointments of this book are the following two: almost all models here are not created in one single  paper, and most are flat models.

And this new book is trying to make &quot;seamless back&quot;  animals. Models in his former book &quot;Origami sculpture&quot; are  excellent, despite almost of them are not seamless-backed. Now in this book  Montroll shows us how to fold legs, head and tail from the edges of a  paper, leaving the center to be the back. At the same time Montroll  continues to make creating models a nature and understandable process. This  is a different approach from other BASE-based folders. Besides, when  folding in wet, effects of models in this book are well. However, I think  this approach can be more mature, for some aethetic reason .	1999-12-19

We have some of the most beauitful  modeling here: A crab, a eagle in full-spread wing(with the feathers!), A  dog in the doghouse(single paper), A very vivid rabbit. And the folding  steps are full of wonder. The only disadvantage in this book is that for a  new folder the diagrams are very neat and succinct, usually Several steps  combined in one diagram.

Every model here needs a  lot (really a lot) patience and many-year folding experience. Or you MUST  fail in folding over half of them. There are lots of unexpected and new  technics, every model is in a neatly calculated mathematical proportion and  with the exactly right number in every part (eyes, legs, antennas, etc.) In  Facing such a book, I completely, deeply, adore the art of origami.	1999-11-20

It's a good idea to make the model come to live, but I'm afraid some  quintessential qualities of origami will be lost. A new and good try, but I  hope this isn't Lang's new style.
