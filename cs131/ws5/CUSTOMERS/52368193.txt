Franco was seeing &quot;Freiras Perversas&quot; in a century-old ex-opera house on vacation in Portugal ... in the cellar with some raincoat locals who clearly thought I was mad showing up there. Anyway. This book contains a lot of essential information on some filmmakers, most notably Franco and Rollin, whose work really is explored further than in all other books there are. But... the book tends to concentrate on directors rather than countries which makes sense as a lot of directors worked euro-wide. But then, you cant have everything. I found this book much more attractive than Mondo Macabro.	2001-11-30

Vachss did have the tendency to focus more on his message than on the action in his last burke novels and somehow we had read it all before. Now, Burke is presumed dead and has to reinvent himself, becoming more a character like &quot;The Shadow&quot;. We learn more about Burke´s past and get to meet in &quot;Seawulf&quot; fashion Lune, another charakter from his non-childhood.<br />Comparing this novel to the earlier Burkes I found that the series becomes more and more a &quot;Criminal Fantasy&quot;, less authentic, less real. More like James Bond, with total disregard to character motivation, logical settings and logical conclusions (eg. Burke is in hospital for months, fakes amnesia and is frequently visited by the police who tell him that they know who he is - and he never asks them to tell him something about himself; He visits Lune in a Reservation far off any road. The only access is a path he has to walk on for hours - getting there it´s ultra modern radar station with 30-40 people working there. I wonder how they are supplied and how this thing got there in the first place; It is never really explained how Lune solves the puzzle, he just does). This disregard for reality left me unsatisfied with reading the novel, because with putting the plot into fantasy land he propels the crimes commited also into &quot;un&quot;-reality, which is a shame as it contradicts the message of the books.	2001-11-09

Just a short comparison to make the point clear: MAFWW had over 250 maps, a short introduction to the course of war in each chapter and as main advantage unbiased information &quot;why&quot; things happened in WW1.<BR>This book now has less maps (about 150) for a much longer period, no written introduction, no &quot;before&quot;, &quot;why&quot;, &quot;and then..&quot; maps, so what you got is basically 10-20 maps for each section, providing you with nothing else but army movements etc. which would be ok, but then these are the kind of maps that you get with each introductonary book for each of the wars depicted. This atlas does not offer any explanatory information on what happened, so youll have to buy a companion book, if youre interested in a specific war and most likely this companion book would contain at least the same amount of maps. So there is no point in buying this book. Besides that, the paper quality is quite bad.	2001-11-09

Frenchman Sajer is forced into the Wehrmacht in 1942 and starts on supply routes on the eastern front. After the fall of Stalingrad the Wehrmacht withdraws from the Don and Sajer joins the Grosse Deutschland Division and becomes a hardened fighter on the eastern front, moving forwards, backwards and fowards again. Finally he flees Prussia on the frozen ice of the baltic sea only to find himself in an american POW.<br />The Execution: The writing is unbelievably gripping. A lot of people do believe that this is a novel, not an autobiography because Sajer is able to describe himself and his sourroundings in a way that draws the reader into his mind and actions. This is a big difference to a lot of autobiographical accounts on the war: You´re not detached, you´re with them. This makes for a frightening read and you´re not sure whether to fear and cheer for the Wehmacht or not. This is very unorthodox and I found it therefore to be very intense.<br />One Warning: Sajer does not ommit anything. And truly, fighting in Russia was hell and some of the scenes he describes are so unbelievably gruesome and beyond any humanity that one wonders if such things really happened.<br />Is it real? A lot of people have questioned whether Sajer is real or/and if he really has seen all he writes about. Question 1 can be answered positively: He is a well-known cartoonist in France, publishing Comic Books on WWII under the name of DIMITRI (check and order at www.amazon.fr). He never tried to hide, but never gave in depth interviews on the book (at least not in english). Has he seen it all? Hard question to answer, sometimes me too thought that he overdramatizes a lot, but I grew up in post-war Germany and spoke with a lot of eastfront fighters and can tell you that all of these things Sajer describes have happened like this frequently - not as an exception. <br />Essential reading for any human being.	2001-10-10

The maps themselves are in black&amp;white, but perfectly presented, with clear, sharp contrasts, so that its very easy to read them even if youre without military background.<BR>The book succeeds in being the ideal starting point for anyone being even remotely interested in WW1. <BR>Every map is accompanied by a short summary of whats going on, most of the times even in the maps themselves which makes the information very easy to consummate.<BR>The real value of the book lies in the fact that it presents the actions and campaigns and politics without judging them, without being biased in any sort of way, may it be the old good vs. bad stereotype or the modern pacifistic viewpoint: It just provides information and what you do with it is up to you.<BR>Highly recommended.	2001-09-18

Reading a Harry Bosch novel you´re surely in for delicate cases, interwoven plots and strange outcomes. Here, Connelly tries it too hard, wich makes a fine meta-reading, but can´t really succeed on the story-telling level.<br />The Plot:<br />L.A. most celebrated black lawyer is dead. Killed. Obviously by a police officer. L.A. is on the brink of another week of looting and crime. Bosch has to investigate together with his arch-enemy chastain. FBI takes charge, too  and so three teams set out to clear the case within a few hours before L.A. becomes inferno. Bosch´s lead is a good one, leading him to child abuse, blackmail, police crimes and so on. Three Head pop up when one is cut off.<br />The execution:<br />This has got to be the book with most sub-plots, surprise, table-turnings that Connelly has written so far. And, be sure, these things are his trademark. Somewhere in the book you find yourself sweating to keep track what´s going on. And so is the hero: Harry Bosch nearly stumbles through this book, but then, there´s nothing much left for him to do. <br />The Verdict:<br />A critic or wanna-be writer will surely admire this book for its complexity and skill, the normal reader will be somewhat bewildered at what´s going on all the time. But then, at least there is no sign of stretching the story too far, as Connelly usually does to get his pages full. This time, with all its contens, the book could, should have been longer since characterization is lead to a cardboard minimum. Nevertheless the strongest Harry Bosch Novel.	2001-03-28
US	52368193	R2OT8NDC99YX7C	0446609145	559013514	Void Moon	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Promising start, but can´t hold its pace	Nice book by Michael Connelly whose whole life seem to have taken place between L.A. and Las Vegas. The books starts of breathtakingly, the first part being a tour-de-force for any fan of &quot;the great bank robbery&quot;. After that, though the book deteriorates a little and Connelly starts stretching the story to get his pages full.<br />The Story:<br />Cassie Black your perfect professional robber, out on probation. Circumstances let her have take on the last, big thing, which eventually leeds her back to the place where she lost the big love of her life, finally putting her against those responsible for his death.<br />The execution:<br />The build-up and the robbery itself is described in perfect manner, but Connelly does the mistake of stopping the action in the middle, switching the point-of-view and leave the rest of the robbery unexplained until the end. The second part of the book concentrates on the hit-man sent out for her and how he finds out about her. Enjoyable piece of investigation, but not really suspenseful. The last part is the showdown with each chapter changing the point-of-view. Though we're in for some surprises - as is usual with Connelly - the narration cannot pick up the speed again.<br />The Verdict:<br />If you´re new to Connelly this is as pleasant an entry as it can get, since the book is very much outside of his usual universe and so you don´t miss any background knowledge. For hardened Connelly followers there is one rule &quot;There are no coincidents&quot; and once you´ve learned that one, the book becomes too predictable. Enjoyable.	2001-03-28

It starts out as an easy investigation but becomes very complicated in the end.<br />The Character:<br />McCaleb is no Bosch - and that is ok. Although not perfectly convincing, this is a nice change of character. McCaleb is older and physically disabled which makes his work less action-orientated.<br />The Execution:<br />Masterly plottet, this has to be the best story so far by Connelly, whose pulp-stories always entertain. The story concludes nicely, but then a look at your hands will show you that over 100 pages are still left and you should be prepared for a very clever surprise ending.<br />Sometimes the story drags along, a little bit less (or a subplot more) could not have harmed.<br />But all the Connelly-ingrediences are there: Cases-within a case, old cases which are told _em route_ but are worth getting their own book, characters from other books keep showing up and here and there a nice hint on which crime novels the author himself is currently reading.<br />The Verdict:<br />Plotwise his strongest book, McCaleb is a more casual character than Bosch, a bit too boring in the middle, but nevertheless a fine piece of fiction.	2001-03-13

In a series of tactical exercises though, HH  is able to make some impression with her downgraded ship, wich infuriates  the other side´s commander, so that she´s ordered to basilisk station, an  important but neglected outpost. Arriving there she finds out that the CO  on station is a former acadamy collegue who had sexually harrassed her and  whom she´d beaten up for this. As revenge, he takes his ship back to the  repair-docks and leaves her all the work - again something that she  possibly can´t cope with but does. Finally she´s facing an invasion plot  from an enemy republic. <br />The execution:<br />The story is fun, fast-paced  and not too sophisticated, so ít´s easy to read. But some crucial parts in  the story simply don´t work. <br />1. Before Fearless arrival, the Majestic  was alone, so I cannot see that it is &quot;impossible&quot; for the  Fearless to &quot;discharge her duties&quot;, as she´s now alone on  Basilisk station.<br />2. HH is never fully characterised, the people  themselves don´t act human - more like machines. Relationships are never  examined, and if, only on a professional basis. Human relationships do not  occur at all in this book.<br />3. None of HH`s maneuvres and tactics are more  than any capable officer would have done. In the end, she relies on luck  ... too much luck in my book.<br />The list could go on.<br />That said, if you  put logic aside and simply want to be entertained, it´s ok. Pure  holiday-stuff.	2000-07-31

The conclusion is that if a so many people think that this is  really a great book it is a very, very sad statement on the state of  children's education and culture not only in the U.K. but in the  industrialised countries worldwide.<br />If you read something like Winnie or  Alice or the Neverending Story, you wonder what is so special about Potter.  Yes, the story is funny and fast-paced and there is mystery enough in it to  make it successful. I can understand that. But I cannot understand people  saying that it is actually a GOOD BOOK. It is not. It fails in a lot of  aspects: Narration is sloppy, sometimes simply omitting story-lines in the  middle of the book and sometimes things are not explained at all. (Like how  did Harry get his cloak of invisibility back from the astronomer's tower?).  The style of writing is ok, but neither good nor competent (I once counted  10 times &quot;Harry said...&quot;, &quot;Harry looked ...&quot; etc. in  one paragraph.<br />The Verdict: Yeah, it's ok. You can buy it for yourself or  your children. It was ok for me too and I bought #2 too (which is boring  and I will not buy #3). I will give them to my nephew when he gets old  enough.<br />But it's really sad that people do not know any more what really  good children's literature is like.	2000-07-12

In large format, beautifully bound with a stylish grey-bordeaux dirt-cover, printed on heavy paper with 4 color-illustrations  and a lot of calligraphic work, it surely looks impressive (and much more  expensive than it actually is). I immediately ordered the others of the  GRANT Edition and they now hold a special place on my bookshelve.<br />2. It´s  pure. Here we have R.E. Howard. No Camp, Nyberg or other substandard  writers trying to make this &quot;their&quot; Conan. So this is far more  grim and dark than you would expect.<br />3. The story is great. One would  argue if it´s the best, but since it´s the only real novel, it cannot be  compared to the short stories. I had not read it before and I was very  moved to find such a treasure 20 years after my initial readings of the  barbarian.<br />4. I don´t know how many of these books are left, but since  they were published more than 10 years ago (I still received the 1st ed.) I  doubt that they will be available much longer.

But this is not a heroic  recount of that time, no pro-communist biased official praise. <br />Djilan,  who was arrested in the 50ies and 60ies for openly opposing  comunism/stalinism here gives an evenhanded account on how things were, not  sparing out the atrocities done by the partisans.<br />The book is easy to  read, but a little short on background information, so you´ll have to check  some facts, names, places yourself. <br />One of the best books on WWII I´ve  read.	2000-05-12

But unlike Hardy's (Aurum) Overlook Enc. of  Horror Films, where the authors actually have seen all the films, Weldon  here far too often puts together all of the propaganda material he  obviously possessed without having seen the movie. So the book reads more  like a collection of flyers and is not a help for anyone that wants to  check out if the film is worth the effort. Now-nearly 20 years later, a lot  of those rare gems are available through specialised distributors and its  Weldon's Book that started it all.

There is so much to explore and so much to see - I  still get excited about some strange little movie from a strange little  country I´ve not heard of before. <br />Films like the Shogun-Assassin-Series  or those of Coffin Joe would have been long forgotten if not this book had  brought them to a broader public.

(as in 1632)and again Flint shows considerable historical knowledge as the &quot;Mother of Demons&quot;, a human historian  tries to deduct the right decision for the tribes out of human history  (let´s talk about Hegel, then). <br />The Concept as such is interesting.  BUT....<br />Flint`s self-confidence in historic matters and his eagerness to  communicate historic facts and lines to the average sf-reader cannot  satisfy anyone seriously interested in History. It all becomes cliche.  (Though, if you are the average sf-reader without historic interest, add  one star). Example: He relates both to the Nazis and Steuben (one negative  and one positive) but fails to point out that they both emerged from the  same prussian militarism. You can´t have one without the other. (Americans  will hate me for this, I know)<br />Although the story itself is interesting,  the style of writing is sketchy and for my taste, Flint should have stuck  to one perspective (either human of gukuy). The Gukuy part is much more  interesting though.<br />Characterization of the humans is weak.<br />Please  remember the title: As a sf-novel, it´s good, as philosophical essay, it´s  ridicolous.	2000-04-25

Cook was new to me and a welcome addition to my list of &quot;authors I can buy a book from now and then&quot;. The short, hard style of writing provides a welcome change from the long,  page-consuming descriptions given by other authors (e.g. Goodkind). To me,  the situation reminded me very much of the 30years war, but reading other  reviews, the author succeeded obviously in describing mercenaries in every  major war. What I liked the most about this book was the honesty about the  trade of war and that the protagonist does not know more (and thus reader  does not know more) than he actually can know. So things are confused  sometimes, cannot be explained fully and turn out differently than  expected. Customers that liked this book should read:<br />1. Battlecry by  Leon Uris<br />2. The Naked and the Dead by Norman Mailer<br />3. Simplicissimus  by Grimmelshausen<br />4. A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin<br />I´m  looking forward to reading part II.	2000-04-11

Cant do more than fully agree to the review of Harriet here.  Treloar becomes uninteresting since he is not personally involved, his character is not as eleborate as in the other two splendid novels. As with SPQR, the series started of very promising. But Roberts seems to be losing interest  after 2 books....	2000-04-03

The jews just simply werent their scapegoat. And having  read the original papers of the correspondence between &quot;Bulgaria i  Tretiat Reich (Bulgaria and the Third Reich)&quot; that were published in  two extensive volumes in Bulgaria 1992 I have to say the author has not  done his homework. And having read one readers reaction thinking that this  book justifies Goldhagens thesis - I have to say its a dangerous piece of  biased writing too. Maybe the Germans are our scapegoats now.	2000-03-28

However I have to say that this can only be considered a &quot;good&quot; book by someone who has  not read any good book in his life. Sorry. The writing is uneven, with some  mediocre but entertaining 200 pages of introduction, 400 pages of american  fantasy soap-opera hugging and talking, 150 pages of unnecessary, nasty and  de-sade-like kinky violence nad about 100 Pages of a very unsatisfying end.  The quality of writing is very uneven. The strongest part (sic!) is the  torturing of Richard and this gives us some insight on the author. The  whole concept behind this book is as amateurish as it´s map and it´s shows  the first-timer Goodkind is very obviously.<br />What really angered me  sometimes was the very little insight Goodkind has in people. His  characters never act like anyone would in real life. No, Mr. Goodkind, in  war-torn countries, people don´t hug at any given opportunity, they don´t  pad on each other´s shoulder, and when they´re hungry, they eat ALL of an  apple. Maybe this is a difference between someone like Tolkien (who lived  through WWII) and a limited-gifted author, living in a country that for 5  generations always fought its wars on foreign soil. Read George RR Martin´s  Song of Fire and Ice instead.	2000-03-27
US	52368193	R2SJU3YGAEZMT6	0893661503	224387703	The Armageddon Rag	Books	4	24	31	N	N	A classic.	By now, this has to be a classic in the fantasy/horror field. I remember picking it up in as price-reduced overstock, simply for the astonishing artwork (the german edition) and that title. I have to say, that I´m still  very thankful for that occasion. Not only has Mr. Martin delivered the best  Werewolf-Novellla of all time (Skintrade) but the Song of Fire and Ice  Series, that had reignited my interest in Fantasy after 15 years.<br />Thank  you Mr. Martin.<br />I want a hardcover-reprint of this book. Now.	2000-03-27

I wish JMR would take some more time for his series. They all start very impressively (SPQR, CINGULUM, TRELOAR) in the first 2 or 3  books and then he seems to loose interest. SPQR VIII and IX actually lack  the humor and warmth of the series beginning and read more like written to  fullfil a contract. Sad so. I hope though, that interest stays high and  that he will return to better form with books X to XX or so... (for more  info about the german series look into amazon.de)	2000-01-28

Seldom I have read a crime novel with so much human warmth and understanding. I could fully identify with Gabe. Much better than the SPQR-series (which is not bad at all) and a  quantum leap from Conan or other &quot;I have to feed some mouths&quot; -  works in the fantasy field.	1999-10-21

It does not only include some nearly perfect horror-stories but some odd Kane-pieces and a  lot of information about the author and his life. The two recollections  (one by Peter Straub) about the man himself show us that Wagner lived his  stories. So he belongs there: With Howard, Poe and Lovecraft. I hope this  never gets out of print.	1999-09-23
