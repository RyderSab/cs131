That's at the heart of Jan Coleman's message in Unshakeable, a fun, easy read, despite its challenging topic. I loved her remark at the end of the book: \\"There is always a way back to God. His unending love is the inner circle of safety. He doesn't care where we've been or what we've done, only where we are heading now.\\" Jan gently leads us to that point where we can nod our heads and then walk in the same direction--toward Christ. I recommend this highly.	2005-04-25

For those who are &quot;gutting it out&quot; in their marriages, she offers help and hope, and even the best marriages could be improved by reading her book.  Some of what she teaches that impacted me include the following:<br />* FAIRNESS: &quot;Most of us live under the illusion that life is fair--or at least should be.  The illusion that marriage is fifty-fifty. I shouldn't have to give more than I get.  This kind of wishful thinking will always keep us stuck in immaturity or resentment.  Or both.&quot; <BR>  <BR>* CHOICES: &quot;Our choices reveal what we love the most, what we fear, what is of ultimate value to us, and what we think we need in life--in other words, our choices expose the dominant desires of our heart.&quot;<br />* TRAINING: &quot;God never tells us to try to be spiritual, he tells us to train. ... Do you want to be more like Jesus? Stop trying and start training.&quot;<BR>  <BR>* KINDNESS: &quot;Beng kind and gracious doesn't mean you ignore the wrongdoing or pretend it didn't happen.&quot;<br />I highly recommend this book.  Even if you're not even married, you'll find it helps you grow in personal relationships.	2001-10-27
