Just what he did at the ranch day by day, season by season.  Hard to explain why, but it's fascinating.  Especially after coming home from an office job.  There is a lot about the people he works with and a little about the history of the ranch and environs.  Great portraits of people and horses.  I would have liked a map... also photos of the trucks, machines, horses, fields, culverts he mentions.  If he had stayed on the ranch for another year, I would have been happy to keep reading.	2005-03-26

Read them to your kids and nieces and nephews.  The author eases the reader into an expanded vocabulary painlessly.  I have stopped reading many times to explain a new word, only to find that the text shows the meaning of the word in the next couple of lines.  We have read the books at campfires, in tents, at parks, over the phone and in motel rooms, listened to the tapes on long drives and on the way to school.  We have been through the whole series several times, out loud and on tape.  These books are so wonderful to share!  We are glad that we read the books several times before we saw the movies.  Our favorite book and movie is the Prisoner of Azkaban -- but don't read it first, read them in order.  We were not into anything like this before the Sorcerer's Stone.  What a wonderful gift J.K. Rowling has given us!  She deserves every penny of royalties.	2005-03-26

It was a wonderful experience.  Everyone in the U.S.A. should read these books at least once.  In order.  They should be included in American litereature survey courses with Mark Twain and Hemingway.  (My niece and I have never seen the TV show.  My wife read the books and then saw the show and loved it.)<br /><br />There are two parallel stories in these books.  One is the story of Laura growing up, becoming a teacher and getting married.  This is the kids' story, and it is excellent.<br /><br />The other is the story of Pa as seen through Laura's eyes.  This is the grown-ups' story.  Pa keeps the family moving in search of a better life.  He builds houses, clears forests, takes odd jobs, grows crops and shoots game.  He rises to every deadly challenge, including grasshoppers and the long winter.  With his fiddle and his stories he keeps his family's spirits up in dark times. We last see Pa giving away his \\"little half pint\\" in marriage. (I could not read that part aloud.  Wasn't tough enough.) We can't help but compare Laura's husband, a mere human, to her father, who never failed his family.  We as grown-ups can't help but compare our relatively easy lives to the hard scrabble lives of Ma and Pa.  Pa is this grown-up's hero.	2005-03-26

Before I read it, I knew it was fiction, but after I read it I was very surprised to be reminded of that.  Partly that is due to the spare style.

Highly recommended.  A joy to read.  A great plain-speaking, direct style.  Lots of dry humor.  Left me wishing I could spend more time with \\"Wild Ike.\\"  Overall, it is a bronc-buster's view of a slice a history - the arrival of cattle herds on a large South Dakota reservation, the heyday of the cattle business there, and finally the demise of free range ranching in that area and the arrival of the homesteader.  I was a little concerned that it would be the story of cowboy life 20 years after the end of the cowboy era.  But there are no pickup trucks or ATVs in this narrative, just cattle and horses, cowboys and Indians.  His profiles of dozens of horses (woven into the narrative) would be worthwhile even without the other stories.  (Here's a tip - there is a fold-out map on the last page.  I figured that out when I got to the last page, but you will be happy to have the map as you read.)	2005-03-13

A very conversational style.  The parts about Billy the Kid (a small portion of the book) seem a little out of place and forced, because they are not first person accounts, like the rest of the book.

In fact, I could not bring myself to open the book for a few weeks.  I looked at the photo section, saw one of Derek Fisher's 0.4 second shot, remembered all the hope that came surging back that night, the confidence that built when they beat the Spurs and the Wolves, and the hope every night that they could finally pull it together in Detroit.  Now, Shaq will soon return to L.A. with the Heat, so I opened the book.  It begins with the news that Gary and Karl signed with the Lakers, and all that promise, then continues with Kobe's legal troubles and, eventually, details all the injuries and personality conflicts.  But when the season ends and Phil leaves the Lakers, he feels like a burden has been lifted. And I do, too, now that I read the book.  It helps to make some sense of a complex team and a frustrating season -- and post-season.  Phil accepts that the NBA is a business and that it is run on business decisions.  I am glad he wrote the book.  Now that I finally read it, I feel that that season is behind me, too.	2004-12-22

The author keeps his narrative moving and provides a nice mix of the big picture and vivid snippets.  He generally lets the facts speak for themselves.  It's a story of regular guys accomplishing something spectacular in a horrible situation.  As a baby boomer, it is hard to imagine what WWII was like.  This book helps me begin to appreciate the \\"greatest generation.\\"  The narration is excellent.  The maps that come with the CDs are much too small.

And Jackson is a fascinating subject.  Remini never gets bogged down in military or political minutia.  He keeps the focus on Jackson, what Jackson wanted, what challenges he faced.  He notes what was different then, but does not harp on it.  The chapters are short, and each is a gem.  (Having already written the long version, it might have been easier to be disciplined and concise in the abridgement.)  I'm happy I read it. I learned a lot and spent several evenings enjoying this book.  (I was going to give it 4 stars, because I don't think I will read it again.  But if I do, it will be the long version, so I guess Rimini deserves a \\"high 5.\\")	2004-11-02

(South Pass is the only wagon-friendly route through the Rockies.)  The purpose of Stuart's trip was basically a management report on a private company's progress.  The trip was through largely uncharted territory, and dangers were encountered, but this is not a compelling read.  Here's the most frustrating part: John Jacob Astor, Stuart's boss, elected to keep secret the existence of South Pass.  So this critical piece of geographical info was not used until the Pass was re-discovered in 1823 by William Ashley, who publicized it, leading eventually to the Oregon Trail.  Astor never used his \\"trade secret.\\"  That makes Stuart's trip an interesting historical footnote, not the landmark discovery it could have been if Stuart and Astor had publicized the existence of South Pass.	2004-10-25

An easy, quick, fun read.  But plenty to think about.  Like The Course of Empire (Bernard DeVoto) this weaves together several \\"wanderer\\" stories with a thesis that makes sense.  In this case:  some people just gotta keep movin' and the Western U.S. is a good place to do it.  However, in our society there is a fine line between the nomadic life and self-destruction.  Each person has to find his or her own balance.  Some go over the line and stay there.    For me this helps explain what makes \\"wanderer\\" and explorer stories intriguing:  Undaunted Courage and the Lewis & Clark journals, mountain men stories (A Life Wild and Perilous - Utley; Rendezvous Reader - Maguire, Wild and Barclay; John Colter - Harris), stories of lone guys against the Alaska wilderness (One Man's Wilderness - Keith, Proenneke; Reading the River - Hildebrand; Reader's Companion to Alaska - Ryan, ed.), and RVing adventures (all of Sharlene Minshall's very fun books).  Also \\"on the road\\" stories like Blue Highways (William Least Heat Moon), Travels with Charlie (Steinbeck), Out West (Duncan) and One Year Off (Elliot Cohen, about traveling around the world with his wife and little kids).  And last, but not least, Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House series (read aloud to my niece -- Pa is my hero!).  They appeal to the nomad in us.  I found the author's personal story interesting and not distracting.  The ending is a very important part of the book, tying the personal story and the various vignettes together.    With that said, Mr. Grant does worry too much about being cool.  Maybe this reflects his Esquire magazine readership.  Or just his age.  There is much more to tell about RV nomads than he wants to tell.  When he says that full-time RVers are the dominant nomadic tribe in the U.S. now, he squirms and has a certified cool-guy scoff at the idea.  He can't talk about retirees without focusing on Viagra.  I hopethat at some point he will mellow and be able to explore the dominant nomadic tribe with a more sympathetic eye and ear.  But whatever he chooses to write next, I will look forward to reading it.	2004-05-18

(Nephew and neice to uncle:  &quot;No museums!&quot;) It suggested renting bicycles at the train station to ride to Giverny and told us on which days and at what times we could rent toy boats in the Jardin du Luxembourg -- two highlights of our trip.  It suggested getting the Carte Orange Metro pass and explained the airports so well that we had the courage to take the train into the city (which worked out very well).  The one restaurant suggestion we took from the guidebook (Le Bateau Lavoir in Montmarte) was very nice.  The maps were useful (but you still need a pocket map book) and the book is not too large or fat.  I liked the color pictures before the trip, and now that I open the book, I like them even more as a momento.  We also had the Frommers, Michelin and Eyewitness Paris books.  They were better as references.  The Lonely Planet guide was better to have at hand while we were out and about.

Like Stephen Ambrose, De Voto was a huge fan of L&amp;C.  The whole Course of Empire leads up to the L&amp;C expedition. It really helps to put the expedition in historical perspective.  More than that, it puts the early history of North America in persective, no small task.  Because De Voto cares about the explorers he describes, it's full of great stories.  (Writing in the early 1950s, he did not have to worry about being politically correct.  But the facts speak for themselves.)  A big book and worth the effort.

His sister paid the pilot's wife to bake him a birthday cake.  Did the siblings pay for all the pilot's trips?  Without all of those letters, he might not have been able to sustain his great attitude so long.  Also, what about those \\"mission girls\\"?  It's never resolved.  And how did he power his movie camera?  Another thing:  the prose is so spare for the first year, it's like haiku.  Then in the last few months the journal entries become more intermittent and much longer.  Was that Dick writing more?  If so, why?  Or Sam editing less?  I would like to see the original journals, too.  At least a few passages.  Also, I would like a much more detailed epilogue. How long did he stay in Iowa?  When did he first return?
