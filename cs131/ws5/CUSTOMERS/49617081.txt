Yet for all of Shanghai's sexuality, it is decidedly unsensual due to the determined twinge of commercial opportunity that sours every interaction.<br />In Shanghai, money is sexy and sex is financial, a phenomenon that dominates James Farrer's intriguingly accurate but densely academic study of the city's recent sexual revolution. The characters and scenarios presented in Opening Up: Youth Sex Culture and Market Reform in Shanghai will be entertainingly familiar to residents of Shanghai or any other major Chinese city. Observers who have paid more than passing attention to sex in the city will be gratified for this rigorous quantification of the subject, but they will also probably be frustrated at the dense and distracting academic dialectic attempts to fit Shanghai into some postmodern deconstructive box.<br />Farrer combs comprehensively through all strata of Shanghai society, from the \\"Low Corner\\" blue-collars and marginalized unemployed to the downtown \\"little white collars\\" to the middle-aged \\"old cabbage leaves.\\" These different classes and generations are dissected along with their respective mating rituals and the venues in which they are executed. There is a heavier focus on young white collar women, understandable given the author's perspective as an American married to one of them and his readership's likely greater exposure to and interest (prurient or otherwise) that group.<br />Opening Up is a compelling read for its descriptions and dissections, presented in a fondly familiar tone, but its pace slows when it switches into dense, formal \\"sexuality studies\\" mode. The dense dialectical discourses of Foucault have little off-campus appeal. Farrer has an annoying fondness for the concept of irony, finding it improbably under every leaf and stone of Shanghai's sexual dialogue. He even describes the novel Shanghai Baby, straitforwardly self-important to the point of farce, as ironic, while the only thing ironic about it is the seriousness with which Western readers treat it.<br />As such, Opening Up is best read in piecemeal. Start with the last chapter, \\"Play: Dance and Sex,\\" a hilarious catalogue of Shanghai's various night spots and their respective sexual mores. Then jump to chapter three, \\"Characters: Big and Small\\" for an itemization of archetypes and stereotypes, lest you confuse your \\"KTV misses,\\" \\"fishing girls\\" and \\"golden birds\\". Chapters four to eight are loosely grouped case studies that make for good leisurely perusing, and the densely theoretical introduction and first two chapters require either skimming or intensive plowing.<br />With its detailed documentation of Shanghai's sexual and romantic practices, narratives, expectations and limitations, much of which holds true for the rest of urban China, Opening Up is an interesting read for anyone interested in modern China and an indispensable blueprint for foreigners wishing to date Chinese.oncept of irony, finding it improbably under every leaf and stone of Shanghai's sexual dialogue.

US	49617081	RMN9LNX1VZLDR	0804104549	109006436	Riding the Iron Rooster	Books	4	11	13	N	N	A pleasant ramble through 1980s China	It has become a clich¨¦, but nonetheless true, to remark \\"how much China has changed\\", be it in the past year or month or decade.<br />Reading \\"Riding the Iron Rooster\\" in 2003 Shanghai highlights that truism while calling to mind another: \\"The more things change, the more they stay same.\\" Theroux's China of twenty years ago is an alien world, yet oddly, unsettlingly familiar.<br />Travelogues by definition focus on the details, at risk of missing the forest for the trees, but those details are valuable for illustrating changes in a society. Every single writer to address China in the 1980s made the tired observation of how the blue and gray Mao suit monotony gave way to a cacophony of color in the average Chinese wardrobe. Yet such minutiae, such as the currently popular extrapolation on the proliferation of cellphones and Starbucks and everything else, while not providing the substance of change, are the stylistic curlicues that can represent so much.<br />Theroux's appeal and success lies in his witty, vivid descriptions, and he continues the tradition in this particular tome. However, in the one other book of his I read, \\"The Great Railway Bazaar\\", he created a much better sensation of traveling, and captured the senses of place much more vibrantly. In \\"Iron Rooster\\", he visits so many different places that they all start to blend together, and he makes little effort to explore their differences. One suspects he was trying so hard to get his mind and pen around the whole of China and its changes and society and people that he forgot to stop and smell the chrysanthemums.<br />When he does give himself over to capturing scenes, the wry witticisms make the long slog though the long book worthwhile. Little gems like, \\"The girls even had to have a fancy brassiere, probably the most superfluous garment in China\\" make you wish he had spent more time on said chrysanthemums and less on \\"whither modern China\\". The book also gets bogged down by describing excessively the author's annoying encounters, such as the American tour group at the beginning and his government escort Mr. Fang.<br />Nonetheless, it makes for an intriguing social snapshot of the China that was, and provides an interesting benchmark against which to compare the present day. I wouldn't recommend it for someone who hasn't been to China; it would create false impressions and expectations, especially given how most western readers woefully fail to take into account datedness in regards to other countries. But if you've already been, it makes for an amusing and at times provocative blast to the past.e author's annoying encounters, such as the American tour group at the beginning and his government escort Mr. Fang. <br />Nonetheless, it makes for an intriguing social snapshot of the China that was, and provides an interesting benchmark against which to compare the present day.

It is also one of the most pleasurably readable \\"academic\\" books I've encountered. It takes the obviously sensational topic of prostitution in the \\"Wh*re of the Orient\\" and treats it with candor and humor, not stooping to either exploiting the sensationalism or stifling it under a heavy woolen blanket of academic deconstruction.<br />Hershatter - who enjoys a well-deserved reputation as one of the foremost social historians of Chinese women and of Shanghai - depicts and dissects the prostitutes and the moralists alike, and without condescending moralism. She explains and then adopts the more relaxed Eastern attitude towards the sex trade, which is important in understanding the deeper culture of the courtesan in late Qing and Republican China.<br />The western world is already familiar with Japan's Geisha culture, but China's equally rich courtesan tradion - perhaps because it early attacks by missionaries and abolition by the Communists, those stodgiest of prudes - has less to capture the world's imagination.<br />Shanghai's historical prostitution ran the gamut, from the rarified courtesans to the White Russians to taxi dancers to the cheap bang for the buck street-walking \\"Ye Ji\\" (\\"wild chicken\\"!), and Hershatter touches on them all in this exhaustive project, but her primary interest lies with the courtesans.<br />A young girl would be \\"apprenticed\\" (essentially sold, as with all apprenticeships of the era) to a brothel, where she would grow up learning the arts of hospitality while developing talents in singing, musical instruments, dance, poetry, and painting - the pretensions of China's traditional scholar class. Once prepubescent, she would break into society, and compete for admirers personal and public with her culture as much as her appearance. Her repute would determine the price of her virginity, but afterwards she was relatively free to select her patron-lovers, provided she was in enough demand to have a choice.<br />Hershatter documents how courtesans were the pop stars of early cosmopolitan Shanghai before the occurence of film and pop music, their lives and style dissected in the popular press, which is why the movie and music stars that came later were painted with an aura of disrespectability.<br />Dangerous Pleasures also follows the backlashes against commercial sexuality, culminating in the total eradication of Shanghai's sex trade in the 1950s under the Communists. The tale continues to (almost) present day, with the emergence of prostitution in the early 1990s at foreign-targetted hotels and discos like Galaxy.<br />In Shanghai now as in then, there is much prostitution but no precise prostitutes; instead of courtesans and taxi dancers and tour guides and Wild Chickens, we now have Golden Birds and Fishing Girls and Little Country Sisters and Barbershop Misses. Along with \\"Beyond the Neon Lights\\", a history of Shanghai's lane culture, \\"Dangerous Pleasures\\" illustrates how little has really changed in Shanghai over the past 100 years, which is what makes the city delightful.<br />Despite its heft and specificity, I highly recommend Dangerous Pleasures as first reading for Shanghai novices as well as for Old Hands. It is far more engaging and interesting and readable than the general histories on the market. Don't let its academic credentials phase you, I took this as train reading and couldn't put down.ded she was in enough demand to have a choice.<br />Hershatter documents how courtesans were the pop stars of early cosmopolitan Shanghai before the occurence of film and pop music, their lives and style dissected in the popular press, which is why the movie and music stars that came later were painted with an aura of disrespectability. <br />Dangerous Pleasures also follows the backlashes against commercial sexuality, culminating in the total eradication of Shanghai's sex trade in the 1950s under the Communists.

Unfortunately, Wei Hui misses the ironies and idiosyncrasies of this decidedly skanky scene and rather proceeds to fawningly gush and name-drop throughout. It's quite humorous to us here in Shanghai, as we all know every one of the bar and restaurant owners she repetitively refers to...<br />That does sum up, however, the culture that Wei Hui is depicting. Ignore the ads: this is NOT representative of China, NOT representative of Shanghai, NOT representative of the \\"new youth\\" and NOT representative of China's budding Bohemian crowd. The lifestyle it documents is unique to the anorexic, gaudily made-up gals who lurk in expatriate bars hoping to snare Caucasian sugar daddies who will provide them with visas, condos, cars and/or cash. They'll sleep with a rock musician or artist once in a while to prove that they're \\"alternative\\" and not just party girls.<br />Wei Hui does little to tone down the highly autobiographical nature of the book, which is the reason why it so lacks any sense of humor or perspective. She didn't even change the name of her foreign boyfriend from his real-life version.<br />The author tries to prove her literary credentials by dropping references to great modern Western writers throughout the book, both in the text and in really random quotes at the beginning of each chapter. She particularly uses and abuses Henry Miller and Milan Kundera, who were extremely popular among Shanghainese college students during Wei Hui's student days. She name-drops three different writers within the first five pages of the book, and one Kundera quote gets repeated three different times. Editorial oops. What's most galling, though, is her supposed adulation of Henry Miller, who so despised the sort of artifice which fills this book to gagging.<br />Much has been made in the Western press of how \\"Shanghai Baby\\" was a bestseller that got banned. Well, it was in the top 5 in Shanghai for a few weeks, but hardly registered as one of China's major successes in 2000. By the time it got banned, its sales and accompanying buzz had already dropped from any radars. It was banned not for its sexual or subversive content but rather because its main audience was teenybopper Shanghainese girls, whose parents complained in mass that the book was encouraging a perception that being going to sleazy bars and bopping middle-aged white men is cool.<br />Sad that such a shoddy novel got picked up for English translation and distribution when the much better and more significant literature that comes out of modern China never gets noticed.banned.

Take a trip, write about it with lots of descriptive curliques and viola! money in the bank.<br />Theroux has a sharp eye and a neutral without being self-effacing voice that makes for the best travel writing. He is a master of detail, meticulously recreating the sense of place and space. As a writer, he is superb. And yet...I also sympathize with the criticisms that he exploits a place, visiting only for the writing, dismissing the deeper truth and more complicated understanding for the lurid, the sensational, the scene and the steam.<br />In 'Railway Bazaar' at least, Theroux at least makes no pretentions of being anything more than the passing observer. They are snapshots, vignettes viewed through a train window and filtered through half a bottle of gin. It is personal, and pretends to be nothing more. It also serves as a reaffirming paean to the joys of alcohol and travel.<br />As a book, it has its stops and gos. Slow at the start, it picks up spead through Central Asia, finds its confident footing in South and Southeast Asia, and then flounders through Japan and Russia. At its best, it captures a time and place, such as Vietnam at the end of the war or bits of India. Perhaps I found those parts more coherent because I traveled similar roads some 30 years later, and found it interesting to compare how things have changed - and how they haven't. I suspect other readers will find similar experiences: it is a book for the already seasoned traveller, not the armchair enthusiast.	2002-12-12

Amid the conformity, an eccentric; amid the tradition, a progressive; amid the acquiescence, a rebel; amid the herd, an individual. The tide never has, and probably never will, turn, but it is nice to know that there will always be those willing to swim joyously against it.<br />Li Po, or Li Bai as he is called in standard Mandarin, is one of those rare such characters in Chinese history, and Simon Elegant brings him convincingly to life, a man of flesh and blood and spirit.<br />I know little of Li Bai; here in China he is much memorialized but less remembered, so the tales in &quot;Floating Life&quot; are as much as I know about the mythology beyond the repute of the poems. I'm sure Elegant did his research, though, and it makes for an engaging tale.<br />The device of the acolyte/narrator is awkward at times, and the breaks away from Li Bai's voice cause the book's progression to stumble, but it does allow the tale to be told in first person and without overly rigorous chronology. Li Bai's tales, told through his perspective, witty and insightful, are what make the book.<br />And the book does justice to Li Bai's poetry and ethic. Reading it, one gets lost in the quiet moment, as if downing a bowl of warm Huangjiu in a boat on the West Lake at dusk. Simple, sublime. Li Bai did many things, and is enshrined in the catacombs of history, but what matters is that he knew how to be happy, how to live in the moment.	2002-12-12
US	49617081	RUNNOVX0F0M2F	0887298192	905595665	Insight Compact Guide Shanghai	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Surprisingly accurate, informative, non-patronizing	I live in Shanghai, and usually write guidebooks, not read them. When I do, it's usually to wince at all the things the writers who came here for a mere month or so of research got wrong. Even those without glaring errors tend to be off by angle, such as raving about the rather dull Yu Gardens and failing to notice the incredible living history museum, Shanghai's Old City (aka Chinatown), that it is situated in. They only offer the stupidly obvious destinations, like the Bund, Huaihai Lu, and Nanjing Lu, to the neglect of fascinating, cultural history spots like Sichuan Lu and the Jewish Ghetto.<br />I was handed the compact guide as a reference for a project I was working on, and it pleasantly surprised me. Amazingly, I found nothing to criticize, nothing to wince at. I was impressed to discover in it city trivia that even I consider obscure, like the history of the Broadway Mansions as the old Foreign Correspondents Club.<br />But nicest of all is its refusal to patronize. Many guidebooks take the attitude, \\"You're a stupid Western tourist,doesn't speak any Chinese, so here's what to do!\\" So, if you pick them up having read anything - anything! - about Shanghai previously, you're likely to feel put off. The Compact Guide refreshingly presents the facts without too much condescending background but also without playing insider baseball. It's very accessible.<br />Only two quibbles: the maps are confusing, have a number of typos, don't have characters along with the pinyin, and are so small, listing so few streets, to be useless unless you already know where you are/where you're going (and then, why do you need a map?). Also, Shanghai changes so quickly that, being written three years ago, it is rather woefully out of date. Use its listings with caution.	2002-11-27

It could be subtitled: \\"Beyond the hype, the myths, the stereotypes and the cliches,\\" but Mr. Lu is an academic, and uses sound research to sell his books rather than sensationalism. Bravo for him, I say.<br />Shanghai history books - the sensationalist, badly researched ones, at least - tend to present an Old Shanghai of Gangsters, Bankers, Hookers, and Foreigners...oh my! Even the more thorough ones present mostly the wild advantures of those wacky expatriates, ignoring or neglecting the role and the life of the \\"laobaixing\\", the ordinary people of Shanghai.<br />\\"Beyond the Neon Lights\\" fills this very large gap amazingly well. It is dedicated to life in the lanes that were and are the arteries of the city, the source of its lifeblood, the petty urbanites. Lu explores the architecture of the Shikumen, the typical pre-1920s Shanghai lane dwelling, and explains how its system of sub-sub- and sub-letting fomented the complicated communities that emerged there. He also conveys how the social structures and cultural habits changed with the introduction of more modern lanes (with indoor plumbing, fewer households, etc) and the Art Deco highrises.<br />Every aspect of life in Shanghai was and often still is structured around the lane neighborhood. Although the new-style lanes are less contained, more open, and thus less of a microcosm, both vintages boast their own economy of scale. There is the old-style convenience store, the \\"tobacco and paper shop\\", at the entrance, plus a tailor, produce dealer, shoe-repairman, locksmith, pharacist...and more in the larger lanes. Other needs were serviced by the itineret peddlars, selling goods or repairing them or buying rubbish. The latter, Lu explains, were the main source of income for the housekeepers of the middle class.<br />The roving peddlers still ply their trade in Shanghai's remaining lanes; all that has changed are their regional backgrounds and some of their wares. But now, as then, they are distinguished by the ditties they sing to announce their arrival. I awake every morning to the tune of one of the three rice vendors who frequents my lane; he is followed by a series of seasonal fruit vendors, the chicken man, the beer man, and the used electronic buyers. About once a week the wicker chair repairman wanders by. The travelling cobbler skirts my street, since he has three permanent competitors on the block, but I see and hear him elsewhere. I rarely use their services, but I love hearing them: they make Shanghai Shanghai.<br />Lu also documents the migration patterns that configured the people who normally count themselves as Shanghainese. The relatively high-class ones came from Ningbo, Hangzhou and elsewhere in Zhejiang Province, the middle class from Jiangsu south of the Yangtze, and the dregs from north of the Yangtze. \\"Beyond the Neon Lights\\" goes into interesting depths about the slums of these despised \\"Jiangbei\\" people. This was of particular interest to me, as my current and previous residences are adjacent to the most notorious old slums: along the Suzhou Creek, which still exists, and on the Zhaojiabang Creek, which has since given way to a six-lane highway.<br />All the bustle, activity, and \\"decadence\\" that happened on Shanghai's main streets was only possible because of the oddly parochial yet international Shanghainese attitudes cultivated in the lanes. They were the foundation of the city, and these attitudes will prevail long after the lanes have vanished to give way to the urban planners' (mostly vengeful Jiangbei people) futuristic vision.

It is interesting, but not profound. It is decently written, but carelessly organized.<br />What makes &quot;Red Dust&quot; valuable is that is a frank, laid-back portrait of &quot;The Real China&quot; (wince) in the early 1980s, a time (unlike now) when few people were writing down such basic observations as this book contains. These observations are not profound, and they ring hollow only when the try to be, but much that is profound can be gleaned from the mundane. A family's eating habits, how easily people can be duped because it is what they want to believe...these are the substance of life, and all the more so in a place where life is so tenuous as in China's interior.<br />But two aspects of &quot;Red Dust&quot;, the account of Ma Jian's three years spent as a Chinese drifter, curdle the incisiveness of his insights. Despite having taken Buddhist vows, and considering himself on something of a pilgrimage for enlightenment, Ma is a rather self-important person, at least as a narrator. Many of the stories he encounters would have told better if he had been able to observe, sometimes, from the sidelines, rather than making it always about him him him. Understandable human trait, but dangerous in literature. A related flaw is the bitterness with which he filters all occurances. China never has - and probably never will be - a place to inspire bounding optimism, but persistant negativity makes a book just unpleasant to read.<br />The beginning chapters document Ma's life as an artist and bohemian type in Beijing, and are both tedious and hilarious. Tediously impressed with themselves for bucking convention, for viciously trying to out-artsy each other, and then praising their own genious, but hilariously true to the type of the Chinese avant-garde, especially in the words, not deeds, climate of Beijing. The crowd is eerily familiar.<br />It is no accident that &quot;Red Dust's&quot; cover bears a plug from &quot;Soul Mountain&quot; author Gao Xingjian, but Ma replicates the Nobel winner's formula so closely that I wonder whether Gao really meant it, or was pleased by the compliment of imitation. Both books are tales of fleeing Beijing for the romanticized countryside in the oppressively political environment of the 1980s. But Gao's book is so much more etherial and important, Ma fares badly in comparison. Ma Jian's writing is merely the Red Dust in the wind from Gao's Soul Mountain.&quot;Red Dust's&quot; cover bears a plug from &quot;Soul Mountain&quot; author Gao Xingjian, but Ma replicates the Nobel winner's formula so closely that I wonder whether Gao really meant it, or was pleased by the compliment of imitation.

Considering that span of time and the slew of excellently researched and well-written books on various aspects of Shanghai's history published in recent years, one would expect this study to be, at the very least, an informed digest of the extant literature.<br />On this and other fronts, Rise and Fall disappoints. It offers neither penetrating new insights nor useful synthesis of existing studies. Dong paints far too broad a portrait to attempt the depth of certain earlier monographs. Rise and Fall merely summarizes, and readers with any prior knowledge of Shanghai's history will find themselves scanning ahead in a futile search for new information.<br />That Rise and Fall makes for a passably good read can be attributed to the intrinsic appeal of Shanghai's story. Rarely before or since has so much compellingly chaotic history been compacted into so short a span of time. Shanghai was the great melting pot, a motley array of quirky characters and outlandish stories. The \\"Paris of the East\\" was Eden, Babylon, Sodom and Gomorrah all rolled into one. It would be difficult to write a history of Shanghai that wasn't interesting.<br />Dong introduces us to some of the many colorful characters who comprise the intriguing tapestry that was Shanghai. We hear briefly of the families of Sephardic Jews who were the Robber Barons of Shanghai's business world, amassing fabulous wealth through shrewd speculation in opium and real estate. They were rivaled only by that giant of the British Empire, Jardine and Matheson. We are teased by tales of lavish parties and indecent opulence. But tease is all that the writer does: She brings up a subject, discusses it for a page or two, and then, just as the reader's interest is aroused, drops it and moves on to the next. The seasoned Shanghai aficionado, if he hasn't quit the book yet, will be wincing at all that gets left out, while the newcomer will be left with an itch to know what happened next -- an itch that goes sadly unscratched. Although Dong had the privilege of meeting with such luminaries of Shanghai's history as Emily Hahn, Irene Kuhn, and Helen Foster Snow, as well as descendents of other notables, she failed to translate these interviews into any fresh perspectives.<br />Rise and Fall presents itself as a \\"popular history\\" rather than a serious academic work, and makes for a light, unstrenuous read. As such, it omits the introduction explaining what methods were used and what choices were made, and why. Likewise suggestive of a lack of substance are the large print font and the total absence of citations.<br />With its focus on the foreign factor in old Shanghai, Rise and Fall at times treats the Chinese as bit players on their own stage. As in many similar books on Old Shanghai, the foreign characters are treated with loving romanticism, while the Shanghainese are reduced to stereotypes: the gangster, the prostitute, the comprador, the coolie, the intellectual, the movie star.<br />Dong makes little effort to portray, let alone investigate, the richly complex \\"native\\" society that emerged in Old Shanghai, as the city's residence tried to reconcile a number of conflicting influences and demands. Harriet Sergeant's excellent and in-depth Shanghai, although also focusing on the foreign factor and at times patronizing towards the \\"locals,\\" at least features a long, sympathetic, and well-constructed chapter on \\"the Chinese\\". Rise and Fall includes a handful of the more famous urbanites -- as Lu Xun, Green Gang head Du Yuesheng, Chiang Kai-shek, and the Soong family -- in her catalogue of characters, but overall the treatment is cursory.<br />Rise and Fall is generally aimed to entertain an audience that has never before read anything aboutShanghai. But it reduces Shanghai's complex and multifaceted history to a distorted and sensationalized stereotype of lurid decadence. The Communist Party propounds this version of things to demonstrate how much better things have gotten since. Ironically, what the authorities issue for the sake of propaganda, foreign writers -- and Dong is no exception -- reiterate for the sake of titillation, with the identical effect of creating a simplified and misleading vision of Old Shanghai.g about Shanghai.

It is beautifully and evocative, a portrait of journeys both physical and spiritual. It is also a very tiring read, and is a chore to get through.<br />The first third of this monstrously long tome is engaging and enjoyable, but the second third is dense, rambling, and confusing. I haven't managed to read past this point, but apparently things pick up at the end. This is not beach reading. This is the sort of book that you take a year on, reading a chapter a week.<br />The &quot;plot&quot;, if you can call it that, of Soul Mountain is well known already. It is significant in that Gao wrote it mainly for his own benefit, and as such is less carefully constructed than his plays and other novels.<br />Soul Mountain's many unusual literary devices work very cleverly in the original Chinese, but are awkward in the translation. This is not to blame the translator, who did a brave job of a daunting task, as it's a matter of linguistic discrepancy. The book is so rife with folklore and obscure cultural and literary references that it will through even the most seasonsed China Hand, not to mention baffle the average reader.<br />My friends who read this book in the original Chinese had much higher praise for it than I could muster, and apparently Gao's other novels are less existencial and far more enjoyable. There is an unfortunate paucity of Gao's works in English. The only other option, The Other Shore, a collection of his later plays, contains only a sampling of his later, more abstract works. Early scripts, such as Bus Stop, which first established his reputation and revolutionized theater in China, are unfortunately unavailable in English. Only as more translations become available will English readers become aware of the scope of Gao's talent and why he is so deserving of the Nobel.	2002-10-12

That it happens to be set during China's Cultural Revolution and revolves around sent-down educated youth is incidental, which is a refreshing change.<br />One of the editorial reviews labels this a \\"moving, often wrenching novel\\"; that it is neither is what makes it so appealing. Dai Sijie's lovely novel is a departure from most the \\"scar literature\\" about the Cultural Revolution in so many refreshing ways. The genre is saturated by epic-length wallow fests, equal parts suffering, self-importance and appeal-to-Western-readers exotica. \\"Balzac\\" is simple, unpretentious, strait-forward and humorous. The tragic overtones of the time are mentioned passingly and straightforwardly, as through the eyes of a youth more concerned with his own affairs than of the nation convulsing around him. Yet its tragedy is so much more moving with such a sparing brush than those that linger morbidly to flesh out all the gory details.<br />The story is told through the eyes of a sent-down youth and his bosom buddy Luo. They are typical teenagers, at once cocky and nervous, at first thrown in over their heads in the small village they are assigned to, but soon figuring things out well enough to manipulate the system, and usually get away with it. Much humor is made through the village headman's infatuation with Luo's alarm clock, the first such thing to ever be seen in the town, and how they use the villages blind trust in its accuracy to steal extra hours of morning sleep.<br />The central characters are not paragons of virtue, and often downright unsympathetic, which makes the plot the more engaging and realistic. With teenage boy duplicity, they both vie to seduce the prettiest girl in the village, the seamstress of the title. Luo's talent for storytelling had won them the task of going to town to see movies and then come back and reenact them for the rest of the village, and first courts the seamstress with his movie tales.<br />After a friend of theirs, another sent-down youth and the child of writers, grudgingly loans them a Balzac book, Luo discovers that French romanticism gets him further with the girl than Korean Communist propaganda. After much plotting, they steal their friend's secret suitcase of banned Western novels, leading to the book's central conflict: Luo's forbidden affair with the seamstress, and the trio's forbidden love affair with literature.<br />In the average Cultural Revolution tale, these love affairs would end disastrously. Perhaps playfully alluding to the cliches of the genre, Dai foreshadows such a romantically tragic ending. What happens instead hilariously cements the book as a solidly realistic and cynical portrait of China and of human nature.<br />It's interesting to note the disparity between the emigrant Chinese writers who went to France and who went to Anglophone countries. While most of the latter, apart from a few notable exceptions, are horrendous writers, those who migrated to France, such as Gao Xingjian and Dai, have honed an elegant literary fusion. This harks back to the 1920s and '30s, when most of the best Chinese writers and artists studied in France. I don't know much about France, but it always does good things to the Chinese.<br />\\"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress\\" is also a physical pleasure to read, with its flowing old typeface, small size and the elegant cover that lured me in despite my dislike of its genre.<br />In absolute terms, \\"Balzac\\" only deserves four stars, but compared to the other books in its genre, which get so many undeserved raves from naive readers who wouldn't know China from Cochinchina, it is definitely a gem.courts the seamstress with his movie tales.<br />After a friend of theirs, another sent-down youth and the child of writers, grudgingly loans them a Balzac book, Luo discovers that French romanticism gets him further with the girl than Korean Communist propaganda.

His elegant, fluid prose establishes a lush, gorgeous setting in the same way that Wong Kar-wei uses lighting and primary colors to create a creamy, dreamy ambiance like dreams of the past after one too many cocktails.<br />\\"Orphans\\" impeccable prose is indisputable, but the author's stylistic excellence can only partially compensate for his shortcomings as a storyteller. As the other reviewers have noted, Ishiguro uses the device of the unreliable narrator to create a sense of confusion and surreality, but once it is created, he fails to do anything interesting with it. The climax of the story, which is the discovery that there really wasn't much of a story, leaves the reader feeling cheated rather than suprised.<br />Ishiguro's father grew up in Old Shanghai, and serves as the basis for the protagonist's playmate. As a setting, he captures the ambiance of decaying romance of the place. The history, however, upon which the worm at the end of the story turns, is flawed. The abduction of a British woman by an inland gangster would have never been tolerated by the Colonial authorities in the 1920s: the right people would be paid off, threats would be made and carried out, and such a matter would be promptly resolved. Moreover, a foreign woman wasn't so prized a trophy, considering all the impoverished White Russian princesses to be had for much less trouble.<br />Also, the most surreal chapters when, towards the end, Christopher is climbing through the war-devastated ghettos to reach his family's old home, where he thinks his parents are being held, is geographically impossible. The fighting described took part in the slums of the northern Zhabei district, far removed from the posh foreign mansions in which his family might have lived. The foreign areas never saw serious fighting.	2002-10-06

Whoever he told me to bite, I bit.\\"<br />In China, Jiang Qing, aka Lan Ping, aka Madame Mao, has all the infamy of Attilla the Hun, Hitler, and the Devil all rolled into one. As leader of the Gang of Four, which led the disasterous Cultural Revolution, Jiang Qing is considered directly responsible for the death of millions and the pointless suffering of hundreds of millions.<br />But Jiang Qing poses a complex, conflicted character, serving as the historical scapegoat for Chairman Mao, who she followed and worshipped far too blindly, not unlike a generation of Chinese who took the Great Helmsman for a god, and paid the painful price. Sure, she was scheming, power hungry, and indifferent to the ramifications of her actions, but she was also an insecure, desperate, and frightened woman. What she did was no different and no worse than the rest of the scheming, power jostling crowd in Zhongnanhai. What set Jiang Qing out from the rest, ultimately, is that she was proud, without shame, and wasn't easily cowed or afraid of \\"losing face.\\" That is what made her remarkable.<br />\\"Becoming Madame Mao\\" is a fictional, first person attempt to get inside Jiang Qing's head and get a grasp around her motivations and all her contradictions. It is an attempt that fails utterly. The writing is awkward at best and often downright awful, but that is not its greatest shortcoming. Min's main flaw is that, rather than providing a intimate and complex insight into the most fascinating woman of 20th Century China, she trivializes both her subject matter and the events that produced her.<br />Anchee Min's Madame Mao is a cardboard cutout, a stereotyped harpy even less sympathetic than the vision of her presented by the official Chinese Communist propaganda.<br />Most of the book's plot, at least, that which isn't invented, is lifted from Ross Terrill's incredible \\"White Bone Demon\\", which remains the authoritative biography of Jiang Qing in both English and Chinese.<br />Terrill's forthright presentation of the facts of Jiang's life, which allow the reader to analyze for himself, is a much better means of understanding Madame Mao than Min's presumptive monologues.errill's forthright presentation of the facts of Jiang's life, which allow the reader to analyze for himself, is a much better means of understanding Madame Mao than Min's presumptive monologues.	2002-10-06

It is overflowing with cattily observant witticisms which will leave you nodding in bemused recognition, if not agreement.<br />Profound, though, it is not. Apart from some interesting research at the beginning of the book, documenting the histories of the bourgeois and the bohemian, the book coasts by on the shakey analytical ground of the colorful journalistic anecdote. Which is great for readability and attendent book sales (and appearance on the talk show circuit), but doesn't really work for proving the existence of a new social paradigm.<br />The concept and term of the BoBos is creative and dead-on in and of itself, and the book works on this strength alone. But two of its pillar thesis ring hollow. One of these is his description of the BoBos themselves. As a 26-year-old BoBo, perhaps my generation of BoBos is a little more pragmatic than those Brooks described, who are now in their late 30s with kids in the suburbs. The [$$$] goretex, the New Agey spiritualism, the frighteningly elaborate kitchens may describe one set of BoBos, but certainly not all or even most. His generalizations were swept too wide.<br />The second problem is Brooks assertion of the BoBo status as \\"the new ruling class\\". That sort of optimism may have seemed a safe guess during the Clinton era, but the reascendency of the Bush Dynasty proves that the old, WASP hereditary elite remains alive and kicking. Sure, BoBo PC sensabilities have invaded the mainstream, and, perhaps, we BoBos will someday rule the roost. But it's easy, in our ivory tower enclaves to forget that the old ethics of WASPdom are still in charge and won't go down without a fight.	2002-09-30

Mere moments have passed since I closed the back cover on &quot;West with the Night&quot;, and already I am missing its world and its voice. It is one of those rare books that can, with the simple fluidity of its narrative, pull you in and engulf you entirely.<br />I am not a big fan of the memoir, but Markham's (or whoever wrote it) voice is neither bombastic nor humble; she feels less a narrator or subject than a fellow traveller, along with you for the ride. Although the life she lived was extraordinary and compelling, she refreshingly views it in clipped, casual, careful terms, as unimpressed with herself as if she'd been a midwestern housewife, not a pilot and horse trainer in Colonial Africa.<br />Many readers will approach &quot;West with the Night&quot; out of a pre-existing interest in and knowledge of its era and characters, and will no doubt experience it entirely differently than I did. While a few names rang vague bells, for the most it was an engaging introduction. But I read it as literature, not as history, and enjoyed it immensely as such. I found her small personal anecdotes far more interesting than the accounts of her grand feats. The Atlantic flight that made her famous rounds out the end of the book, but is rather dry and dull compared to her African tales. Stories such as her father's pompous parrot had me in spasms of public giggles.<br />It is little wonder that Hemmingway praised this book, as the sparse directness of its utilitarian prose makes even the Old Man of the Sea seem a flowery romantic. Its structure can be rather meandering, but in that regard it resembles the contours of memory, which makes me believe Markham did indeed write her own book.	2002-09-30

It is perhaps appropriate that Emily Hahn was friends with Chinese writer and Kuomintang spy Lin Yutang, who despite his dubious politics was a fantastic philosopher and writer. Among his best known works was &quot;The Art of Living,&quot; and Emily Hahn could serve as the poster girl for the Western version of his ideals.<br />Her mythology is well known, although not as well as it deserves to be: she elbowed her way into a male-only university department, lived alone in New York, and drove cross-country with a girlfriend in a time when such things Just Weren't Done. Once she'd exhausted the adventurous possibilities of North America, she struck out for Africa and then China.<br />She was a bohemian in Shanghai, and her flat enjoyed visits from even a grubby, earnest young Mao Zedong and the ever-dapper Zhou Enlai. Unlike other China Hands, though, Hahn mainly shied from revolutionary company in favor of the decidedly bourgeois literati, led by handsome dandy poet Shao Xunmei. (Read &quot;Shanghai Modern&quot; for more on him.) Hahn became Shao's lover and later concubine, and together they launched the literary magazine Tianxia, &quot;Under Heaven&quot;. Emily was also a fixture in the expatriate scene, writing for the New Yorker and known for showing up at Victor Sassoon's lavish parties with a pet baboon in tow, clad in diapers after a few unfortunate mishaps.<br />She moved with the war to Chongqing, and from there to Hong Kong, where she began an indiscret affair and had an illegitimate child with the head of British Secret Services. She sat out the Japanese occupation, returned to the States after the war ended, and then moved with her lover to England.<br />Emily Hahn was more a writer and professional character than a journalist. Her best works are autobiographical, and when she ventured into research the result was painfully propagandistic puff pieces.<br />But that is the problem with this biography: Emily Hahn's life had already been documented with both care and color in her own writings, so Cuthbertson's account mostly rehashes Emily's own words in more prosaic terms. The main advantage is to find out the historical characters behind the fictional names, and to have a clearer chronology than Hahn's writing provides.<br />The thing is, Emily Hahn didn't lead that interesting or colorful or significant a life, not compared to the many other young Americans lured to the East at the same time. Rather, she was so talented at describing people, places, events with a sharply bemused eye for the ironic idiosyncracy.

Disclaimer, I didn't even finish it. Perhaps Mao is a more complicated subject, but the historical discourse, Communist theoretical deconstruction, etc, just bogged me down. I only got as far as the Xian incident before having to return the book.<br />Of the parts I read, though, the account of Mao's youth was compelling, and I suspect later periods of Cultural Revolution and Zhongnanhai power struggles would also prove so.<br />Mao is, of course, a figure of history hard to capture as a human being. Terrill does a good job of dissecting the motivations of the man behind the myth, although such exercises cannot rise about conjecture. This book is worth reading, but not casually: it is highly academic, and requires the commitment of a weight loss program. Stick with it, you'll probably be rewarded.	2002-09-21

It takes an understanding outsider to appreciate these ironic idiosyncracies that Chinese themselves are so oblivious to, and a gifted and sensative writer to portray them without resorting to caricature or mockery.<br />River Town is the most honest and insightful portrayal I have read of China in the late 1990s. Although it takes a small town in Sichuan as its focus, most of Hessler's astute observations are applicable to the rest the country, from metropolis to village. The book is not so much a travelogue as a 'socialogue'.<br />Personally, having lived elsewhere in China during the same periods that the book describes in Fuling, I found myself nodding in agreement throughout the book, and laughing aloud in many a section. Hessler's characterizations, both of China and of how a Westerner changes after a few years in China, are dead on.<br />River Town is the best book available for getting a sense of what China is like, on the most basic level, and explains why we who live here simultaneously love and despise the place. If you are an old China Hand, you will love this book. If you are a total novice to the subject, you couldn't find a more accurate and enjoyable introduction.	2002-09-21

All the more so if you are in your 20s or 30s, a career woman, and/or entertain artistic ambitions. As you read, you will find yourself constantly smiling in recognition and nodding in agreement and understanding.<br />'Fear of Flying' captures the thoughts, fears, obsessions and self-destructions that all women indulge in but are afraid to admit. The great liberation I found in Erica Jong's novel was not the zipless f uck but rather \\"Wow, it's not just me!\\" about the stewing insecurity under the veneer of confidence and success. And, by itemizing those insecurities, she castrates them of their power.<br />'Fear of Flying' is not about sex but, rather, how women seek to define and obliterate themselves through sex and through love. Isadora's sexual journey is pretty tame and ultimately not very liberating, and therein is the book's main point.<br />Women will find 'Fear of Flying' affirming, and men should read it to better understand how women process their emotions and experiences. It would make a great gift for the well-intentioned but clueless boyfriend or husband.<br />The narrative in 'Fear of Flying' is a bit wanting, albeit it is an idea-driven, not story-driven, novel. The Freudian aspect is also a bit overdone; it dates the book in this era of pop psychology and self-help, and is confusing to this generation no longer schooled in Fruedian theory.<br />Nonetheless, it is an amazing book. Sadly, the need for women to learn to live within themselves, to claim their own destinies, remains as controversial a topic as it was decades ago. We haven't come that far, baby.	2002-08-26

This book excellently combines top-notch journalism and fine, precise, descriptive writing for an increbidly enjoyable and informative read. Considering how most such \\"good for you\\" books are long slogs about as exciting as bran, \\"Lenin's Tomb\\" was a surprising pleasure.<br />I came to this book with minimal knowledge of Russia in general, let alone the Soviet transition, and disliking what I had encountered of Russia's culture and people. \\"Lenin's Tomb\\" manages to explain the basics to ignorant laypeople like myself without condescending or dragging through too much history. What you need to understand what was happening, Remnick provides, no more and no less.<br />\\"Lenin's Tomb\\" proved an eye opener about the Soviet experience, but it also reflects on the larger ramifications of Communist autocracy. So many of the explorations of the Soviet erosion of society and culture gave me a sense of Deja Vu compared with China, only China has perhaps been less scathed by the shorter span of its bureaucratic red terror. Also, while \\"Lenin's Tomb\\" did not make me like Russia or Russians any more, it did present the context of how and why people can be a certain way, so that I now hold it against them less.<br />\\"Lenin's Tomb\\" is almost novelesque in its readability, a page-turner and easily beach or plane fare. I doff my hat to Remnick's ability to carve dense political stuff into an involving, compelling narrative. Perhaps Russia scholars would find points to criticize, but from a journalistic perspective, \\"Lenin's Tomb\\" is the book all of us wish we could write.	2002-06-23

It is fundamentally, however, a memoir rather than a \\"book about Shanghai\\", which is why it sells so well. Unfortunately, many readers will take it to be a Shanghai book or a China book, but it is misleading as such.<br />I realize that many have enjoyed \\"Life & Death in Shanghai\\", and even found it inspiring. That's fine. Only readers should take their inspiration with a grain of salt. I do not deny that Nien Cheng is a remarkable, formidable woman. My problem is that Nien Cheng is far too impressed with her own remarkableness, which ultimately makes it difficult to sympathise with her. I do not deny that Nien Cheng suffered greatly during the Cultural Revolution, but so did hundreds of millions others, many far, far worse than she, which makes her self-righteous sense of victimhood almost offensive.<br />Western in her education and sensibilities, Nien Cheng wrote \\"Life & Death in Shanghai\\" with the Western reader deliberately in mind, particularly the Western reader ignorant about China. Her preachy Christian references and repetitive Bible-thumping are clear plays for sympathy, and it feels as manipulative as a Hollywood soundtrack. Puh-lease.<br />Ms. Cheng's religion, I believe, advises that \\"Pride commeth before a fall\\". Yet her narrative is infused with her pride and sense of entitlement. I know Chinese who, like Nien Cheng, are remainders of the Old Shanghai elite. Even with their wealth long-gone, they are erudite, accomplished, and above all exquisitely courteous. The manners of these old scions would take my breath away if they weren't so skilled at making everyone about them feel comfortable. Yes, they have every reason to be proud, but they also had the good sense to get out of China after the Communists took over.<br />Nien Cheng sniffs daintily at the uncouth ways of the unwashed Chinese masses, yet she chose to return to China even as the unwashed masses were conducting a revolution against wealthy, foreign connected capitalists such as herself. Perhaps her pride clouded her judgement. There is nothing wrong with having a high opinion of oneself, particularly when merited, but it makes for tedious companionship and even more tedious reading when not tempered with an ability to self-mock. If Nien Cheng had a sense of humor about her arrogance, she may or may not have avoided her tragedy, but she definately would have written a better book.es were conducting a revolution against wealthy, foreign connected capitalists such as herself.

Lynn Pan is one of the best, if not THE best writer around on subjects of Old Shanghai and the Chinese Diaspora. She is a Writer, however, and not a historian or a journalist. She tells a story, and tells it engagingly and beautifully.<br />\\"Tracing it Home\\" is a vastly superior alternative to the sloppy, melodramatic and orientalized literature from other Overseas Chinese women writers like Maxine Hong Kingston and Amy Tan. Their works, yes, appeal to western readers, but only because they present the stylized characature of Chinese history and culture that western readers imagine, rather than the complicated reality. That is because these Chinese Americans know China only through the lens of immigrant idealized mythology and American misperceptions, rather than their own experience.<br />Lynn is a world different from those poseurs, because she knows and understands China, as it was and as it is. She gives context to the historical cruelties that most ABC writers eroticize. She grew up in Malaysia's dynamic Chinese population and in England and Hong Kong, but was born in and now lives in Shanghai.<br />The story of the Pan family is fascinating and elegantly presented. Lynn's builder grandfather was the Horatio Alger type that made Shanghai famous. The travails his success created for his offspring are remarkable yet common among Shanghai families. Lynn Pan knows this, and avoids the wallowing in self-importance that makes most \\"I survived China\\" memoirs tedius (ie \\"Red Azalea\\", \\"Life and Death in Shanghai\\").<br />Lynn is an elegant, evocative writer, and perhaps the greatest pleasure of \\"Tracing it Home\\" is its purveyance of Shanghai as a place, and her grandfather's large role in shaping the city's geography. The post-modern white box of a 1940s mansion that he built and where Lynn was born is just down the block from my current home, and I can see the Picardie, which he built, out my window.

There is ample reason that it has become one of the classic \\"must reads\\" China books: it is an easy, accessible read that assumes the audience knows little, if anything, about China, and it covers very attention getting \\"human interest\\" type stories.<br />The latter fact has drawn much fire in other reviews, that murders and scandals are hardly representative of any country. While I concur, it also reveals the major problem of Western journalism on China: ignoring the big picture in favor of the exciting story. I have enormous respect for Kristoff and Wudunn as professional journalists, and for their colleagues now working for the NY Times in China. The current Beijing correspondent has done amazing work on the cover-up of the AIDS epidemic in China, the Shanghai correspondent has broken ground with his coverage of organ harvesting in prisons, and another of their staff has done notable work on labor unrest. Those stories are important and provide insight into the larger workings of the machine that is China, but compiled together would create a rather skewered version of the very complicated entity that is China. Unfortunately, what the average American wants to read on China is such sound bytes.<br />I read this book five years ago for a college class, just after returning from my first trip to China. Even then, it was outdated. A deeper criticism, though, is the book's Beijing bias. I, granted, have my own bias as a Shanghai-lander, but it's frustrating reading books by Beijing-based expats. In Beijing, politics is everything and everything is politics, and foreigners, especially journalists, are sequestered into isolated compounds. After exposure to too much coal dust and so uptight an environment in Beijing, one starts to see conspiracy theories and political boogeymen under every bush. The rest of China is not like that.<br />Nonetheless, it is a good overview of China in the early 1990s, and if you're a bit of a \\"China virgin\\", China Wakes coupled with a few Jonathan Spence books should break you in.he early 1990s, and if you're a bit of a \\"China virgin\\", China Wakes coupled with a few Jonathan Spence books should break you in.	2002-04-27

The \\"hooker with a heart of gold\\" is arguably the oldest and most flailed to death device in Western literature. It's a trope all the more stale when told through the eyes of the chivalrous man who saves the sweet girl from her sordid fate.<br />However, \\"The World of Suzie Wong\\" is worth the read not for its obviously silly plot but rather for its amazing descriptions of Hong Kong, from the seedy Wan Chai to the sophisticated snobbery of the Peak, in the 1950s. With its detail of chaotic streets, lecherous sailors, and the noble [people] themselves, it's less a bird's eye view of the port city than a roach's perspective, but sometimes the roach gets a more accurate portrait than the bird.<br />Mason has a meticulous eye for detail, and that's what has made the book a classic. The minitae of outfit and carraige, the lighting and seats at a late night restaurant, the layout of a shop window, the drinks and predjudices at a cocktail party...these are the things that old Hong Kong alive to the reader.<br />Credit is also due to the author for mostly avoiding, and often forthrightly criticizing, the racism of the time. The book works ultimately because Suzie is a multi-demensional character, not a characature of the Chinese Doll. She's not even sympathetic much of the time, although we're made to understand what the narrator sees in her.<br />Ultimately, what matters of this book is not Suzie Wong herself, but the world she inhabited, and which we get to visit for a few brief hours.	2002-04-15

The greatest frustration is his fondness for the flashback, which he uses and abuses in each and every book. At least half of his works (ie. Midnight's Children, Satanic Verses, Ground Beneath Her Feet) have the same structure: Start with dramatic event/situation, usually cataclysmic, spend first 2/3 of book in flashback to events leading up to said event, and last third detailing aftermath and resolution of the event.<br />Another problem, pointed out by the person who recommended Fury to me, is the preponderance of humor inside to India and Pakistani politics and the South Asian diaspora.<br />Fury is a brilliant example of Rushdie's powerful, elegant, and forthright writing without being mired in the flashback ping-pong, the insider baseball, and the over-the-top surrealism and allegory of his earlier work. It showcases his growing into a more mature, universal writer. He's purged the, well, furies of his AngloIndian past that haunt his earlier works and moved on to something more universal.<br />Fury paints a poigent portrait of many things. It captures the mad, brash bustle of New York City at its grandest, its most omnipotent and incontrovertible in the heady days before the little pop and big bang of the dot-com bust and 9/11. It also skewers, masticates, digests and defecates America in its turn of the millenium Golden Age of plenty, revealing how the end of that era, such a seeming surprise, had its warnings in how we responded to our spiraling greatness with increasing pettiness.<br />In its depiction of the era just past, in America as represented by NYC, as seen the foreign eyes, Fury is great to read accompanied by U2's &quot;All that you can't leave behind&quot; on the stereo.<br />The book also portrays the human soul, its illogical longings and the frustrations that build up under the surface into a boiling, raging Fury far greater for their original source. In a culture fonder of wallowing in its problems than dealing with them, Fury is a timely call to arms...and to honesty.ture fonder of wallowing in its problems than dealing with them, Fury is a timely call to arms...and to honesty.	2002-04-10

This shows in the early parts of the book, where Min casually portrays the grand tragedy of the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution years via small, personal sorrows. The bizarre, forced relocation of her family and the tale of her pet chicken shine with the subtly humorous depth of the personal farce. Later, the passing portrayals of her parents and neighbors exhibit a similar tender insight.<br />The problem arises when Min steps in front of her own camera, so to speak. The aspiring starlet can only manage Maoist opera-style overacting and melodrama, losing her coherency of narrative in her eagerness to be the tragic heroine. It is the rare writer who can pull off an unironic first person narrative without waxing self-important. Like other contemporary Chinese women writers, such as Hong Ying and Wei Hui, Anchee Min is unaware of how tiresome navel-staring can be in literature.<br />Moreover, while description is essential to a story, Red Azeala relies excessively on flowerly language, falling ever deeper in its mire until the final chapters, which are unreadable for all the decaying rose petals the author buries us in. That sort of exotic erotic orientalized imagery may sell books, but it also destroys their integrity.	2002-04-10

It can be consumed, processed, and enjoyed by readers who are not, per say, Miller fans, as the themes are somewhat broader than his usual subject matter of himself and his friends.<br />This is a great book to introduce newcomers to Miller's work. It also is a fascinating portrait of America at a point in time and from a certain perspective. Especially given the modern habit of romanticizing the WW2 era, Air Conditioned Nightmare gives an alternative, cynical view that remains insightful today.<br />What holds me back from giving the book five stars is that it falls victim particularly harshly to Miller's characteristic laziness. His favorite trope of gushing over some new friend of his for a chapter or two unfortunately dominates the book, and he rambles off on some very dull tangents about things like car trouble.<br />Nonetheless, there's plenty of Miller's brilliant diatribes and observations, which make it quite worth the while to plough through the hubris.	2002-03-26

His elegant, fluid prose establishes a lush, gorgeous setting in the same way that Wong Kar-wei uses lighting and primary colors to create a creamy, dreamy ambiance like dreams of the past after one too many cocktails.<br />&quot;Orphans&quot; impeccable prose is indisputable, but the author's stylistic excellence can only partially compensate for his shortcomings as a storyteller. As the other reviewers have noted, Ishiguro uses the device of the unreliable narrator to create a sense of confusion and surreality, but once it is created, he fails to do anything interesting with it. The climax of the story, which is the discovery that there really wasn't much of a story, leaves the reader feeling cheated rather than suprised.<br />Ishiguro's father grew up in Old Shanghai, and serves as the basis for the protagonist's playmate. As a setting, he captures the ambiance of decaying romance of the place. The history, however, upon which the worm at the end of the story turns, is flawed. The abduction of a British woman by an inland gangster would have never been tolerated by the Colonial authorities in the 1920s: the right people would be paid off, threats would be made and carried out, and such a matter would be promptly resolved. Moreover, a foreign woman wasn't so prized a trophy, considering all the impoverished White Russian princesses to be had for much less trouble.<br />Also, the most surreal chapters when, towards the end, Christopher is climbing through the war-devastated ghettos to reach his family's old home, where he thinks his parents are being held, is geographically impossible. The fighting described took part in the slums of the northern Zhabei district, far removed from the posh foreign mansions in which his family might have lived. The foreign areas never saw serious fighting.	2001-11-09

It takes an understanding outsider to appreciate these ironic idiosyncracies that Chinese themselves are so oblivious to, and a gifted and sensative writer to portray them without resorting to caricature or mockery.<br />River Town is the most honest and insightful portrayal I have read of China in the late 1990s. Although it takes a small town in Sichuan as its focus, most of Hessler's astute observations are applicable to the rest the country, from metropolis to village. The book is not so much a travelogue as a 'socialogue'.<br />Personally, having lived elsewhere in China during the same periods that the book describes in Fuling, I found myself nodding in agreement throughout the book, and laughing aloud in many a section. Hessler's characterizations, both of China and of how a Westerner changes after a few years in China, are dead on.<br />River Town is the best book available for getting a sense of what China is like, on the most basic level, and explains why we who live here simultaneously love and despise the place. If you are an old China Hand, you will love this book. If you are a total novice to the subject, you couldn't find a more accurate and enjoyable introduction.	2001-10-18

Centered around a fictitious province in China named Liquorland, the novel portrays China's obsession with food and drink and skewers the extremes to which it is taken by the wealthy and the politically connected (which are often one and the same). There is an expression in Chinese &quot;Chi-he-wan-le&quot; literally &quot;Eat-Imbibe-Play-Joy&quot;. In ancient China, the landed and the literati had elaborate rituals and cultures surrounding the consumption of delicacies and fine liquor, which were mingled with the higher arts such as poetry composition, calligraphy, painting, and music. The Cultural Revolution attacked such traditions (among other things), and in its aftermath the finer points disappeared, leaving only its cruder translation: gluttony. Many Chinese know of few entertainments besides food and booze. A Chinese banquet is a grandiose affair, aimed at wasting expensive food and flaunting one's wealth. The higher level the revelers, and the bigger the favors the host is trying to earn, the more obscenely wasteful the dishes. Especially in the 1980s, when government corruption peaked, wining and dining was a popular form of bribery that took a chunk out of the Chinese treasury to the tune of billions of dollars per year. Republic of Wine is beautifully biting in its spoofing of this food obsession, which includes a craving for ever more exotic and expensive foods to impress ones guests with, here taken to the frighteningly logical extreme of serving up braised infants. Mo Yan also mocks the farcical attempt of Chinese men to prove their dubious machismo by &quot;bottoms-upping&quot; toast after toast: the last one standing is the &quot;real man&quot;.<br />Mo's winding, rambling narrative is the book's only shortcoming, which may be deliberate as it flirts with assertions that it was written under the influence. In some ways, the surrealism and sarcasm are overplayed to a degree that makes it difficult to become very involved in the stories. In that regard, it reminds me of the stories of Wang Shuo; the similarity may be partially due to the esteemed Howard Goldblatt, who translated both of Wang's English versions as well as Republic of Wine.ot;.<br />Mo's winding, rambling narrative is the book's only shortcoming, which may be deliberate as it flirts with assertions that it was written under the influence.

Unfortunately, Wei Hui misses the ironies and idiosyncrasies of this decidedly skanky scene and rather proceeds to fawningly gush and name-drop throughout.  It's quite humorous to us here in Shanghai, as we all know every one of the bar and restaurant owners she repetitively refers to...<br />That does sum up, however, the culture that Wei Hui is depicting. Ignore the ads: this is NOT representative of China, NOT representative of Shanghai, NOT representative of the \\"new youth\\" and NOT representative of China's budding Bohemian crowd.  The lifestyle it documents is unique to the anorexic, gaudily made-up gals who lurk in expatriate bars hoping to snare Caucasian sugar daddies who will provide them with visas, condos, cars and/or cash.  They'll sleep with a rock musician or artist once in a while to prove that they're \\"alternative\\" and not just party girls. <br />Wei Hui does little to tone down the highly autobiographical nature of the book, which is the reason why it so lacks any sense of humor or perspective.  She didn't even change the name of her foreign boyfriend from his real-life version.  <br />The author tries to prove her literary credentials by dropping references to great modern Western writers throughout the book, both in the text and in really random quotes at the beginning of each chapter.  She particularly uses and abuses Henry Miller and Milan Kundera, who were extremely popular among Shanghainese college students during Wei Hui's student days.  She name-drops three different writers within the first five pages of the book, and one Kundera quote gets repeated three different times. Editorial oops.  What's most galling, though, is her supposed adulation of Henry Miller, who so despised the sort of artifice which fills this book to gagging.<br />Much has been made in the Western press of how \\"Shanghai Baby\\" was a bestseller that got banned.  Well, it was in the top 5 in Shanghai for a few weeks, but hardly registered as one of China's major successes in 2000.  By the time it got banned, its sales and accompanying buzz had already dropped from any radars.  It was banned not for its sexual or subversive content but rather because its main audience was teenybopper Shanghainese girls, whose parents complained in mass that the book was encouraging a perception that being going to sleazy bars and bopping middle-aged white men is cool. <br />Sad that such a shoddy novel got picked up for English translation and distribution when so much better and more significant literature is coming out of modern China but never gets noticed.	2001-08-22

Zhang Henshui was the Danielle Steel of early 20th century China, and this, one of his best known novels, has it all. Sex, suspense, intreague, betrayal...a page turner indeed.<br />Shanghai Express is an enjoyable if not very edifying read. Like all trashy novels, its hard not to feel guilty for the expenditure of time and money, but its foreign-ness and time frame should assauge some misgivings.<br />As 1930s pop literature, though, it does paint an interesting portrait of the manners and mores of its time.

The book is neither noir nor surreal, as it is often labelled, but filtered through the hazy lens of alientation and indifference, the reader quickly becomes as defracted as the characters.<br />I hated this book, but found it totally addictive. Wang Shuo is a master storyteller, and like a good film director, cleverly manipulates his audience, and we are always exactly where he wants us to be.<br />The plot is pretty petty and pointless, but the rambling narrative presents the best literary portrait there is of Beijing in the 1980s. It is especially amusing in its scathing portrait of the new semi-rich wheeler-dealer class, in all their tastelessness and self-importance.<br />Wang Shuo is arguably the most critically and commercially successful writer in modern China, and is also an acclaimed screen writer.

Whoever he told me to bite, I bit.&quot;<br />In China, Jiang Qing, aka Lan Ping, aka Madame Mao, has all the infamy of Attilla the Hun, Hitler, and the Devil all rolled into one. As leader of the Gang of Four, which led the disasterous Cultural Revolution, Jiang Qing is considered directly responsible for the death of millions and the pointless suffering of hundreds of millions.<br />But Jiang Qing poses a complex, conflicted character, serving as the historical scapegoat for Chairman Mao, who she followed and worshipped far too blindly, not unlike a generation of Chinese who took the Great Helmsman for a god, and paid the painful price. Sure, she was scheming, power hungry, and indifferent to the ramifications of her actions, but she was also an insecure, desperate, and frightened woman. What she did was no different and no worse than the rest of the scheming, power jostling crowd in Zhongnanhai. What set Jiang Qing out from the rest, ultimately, is that she was proud, without shame, and wasn't easily cowed or afraid of &quot;losing face.&quot; That is what made her remarkable.<br />&quot;Becoming Madame Mao&quot; is a fictional, first person attempt to get inside Jiang Qing's head and get a grasp around her motivations and all her contradictions. It is an attempt that fails utterly. The writing is awkward at best and often downright awful, but that is not its greatest shortcoming. Min's main flaw is that, rather than providing a intimate and complex insight into the most fascinating woman of 20th Century China, she trivializes both her subject matter and the events that produced her.<br />Anchee Min's Madame Mao is a cardboard cutout, a stereotyped harpy even less sympathetic than the vision of her presented by the official Chinese Communist propaganda.<br />Most of the book's plot, at least, that which isn't invented, is lifted from Ross Terrill's incredible &quot;White Bone Demon&quot;, which remains the authoritative biography of Jiang Qing in both English and Chinese.<br />Terrill's forthright presentation of the facts of Jiang's life, which allow the reader to analyze for himself, is a much better means of understanding Madame Mao than Min's presumptive monologues.ing in both English and Chinese. <br />Terrill's forthright presentation of the facts of Jiang's life, which allow the reader to analyze for himself, is a much better means of understanding Madame Mao than Min's presumptive monologues.	2001-07-27

The genre features scenes from post-reform China, through the eyes of a young woman with soaring literary ambitions (but less remarkable talent) who experiments heavily with sex and drugs.<br />That these books are semi-autobiographical are hyped as their primary selling point. &quot;A young Chinese woman reveals her sexual escapades...!&quot; But the result is a prententious sense of self-importance in the writer/protagonist's narrative, with some two-hundred pages of bombastic navel-staring.<br />There's so little available in English on contemporary China that such books come as scandalous revelations for Western readers who never imagined that drug use and casual sex present a norm for many young urbanites.<br />Hong Ying's depiction of a promiscuous aspiring poet's slumming about in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square is saved from pure trashy novel status by it's &quot;historical significance&quot;, but that doesn't make it any more interesting to read. At least the writing is passably decent, at least compared to most of Hong Ying's contemporaries in the genre.

Chinese lit in English is full to gagging point with tramatic, melodramatic accounts, hyperboles of the hyperbolic, of the evils of Communist China.<br />But the truth is, the majority of Chinese have suffered quietly and in small, irritating ways under the current regime, rather than in the excesses so often portrayed in the West. The persecution even of the Cultural Revolution was, for most, a swarm of mosquitos rather than a gun to the head.<br />Ha Jin's talent is for displaying the humour in the ironies of modern China: the grasping, petty bureaucratism of small officials, the obsession with face, the reluctance to stand up for justice, the fatalistic passivity. These are things inherent to China, but exacerbated by Communist rule.<br />&quot;In the Pond&quot; is my favorite of Ha Jin's novels, mainly due to its gentle mocking of all of its characters. Like all of Ha's works, it is a fast, engaging, enjoyable read. But, more interestingly, it is a subtly scathing portrait of the ineffectiveness of China's intellectuals: sometimes mice that roar, but ultimately easily bought out.<br />This book is one of the fairest portrayals of the idiosyncrasies of modern Chinese society, politics, and the mainstream mentality.	2001-07-27

It is beautifully and evocative, a portrait of journeys both physical and spiritual. It is also a very tiring read, and is a chore to get through.<br />The first third of this monstrously long tome is engaging and enjoyable, but the second third is dense, rambling, and confusing. I haven't managed to read past this point, but apparently things pick up at the end. This is not beach reading. This is the sort of book that you take a year on, reading a chapter a week.<br />The &quot;plot&quot;, if you can call it that, of Soul Mountain is well known already. It is significant in that Gao wrote it mainly for his own benefit, and as such is less carefully constructed than his plays and other novels.<br />Soul Mountain's many unusual literary devices work very cleverly in the original Chinese, but are awkward in the translation. This is not to blame the translator, who did a brave job of a daunting task, as it's a matter of linguistic discrepancy. The book is so rife with folklore and obscure cultural and literary references that it will through even the most seasonsed China Hand, not to mention baffle the average reader.<br />My friends who read this book in the original Chinese had much higher praise for it than I could muster, and apparently Gao's other novels are less existencial and far more enjoyable. There is an unfortunate paucity of Gao's works in English. The only other option, The Other Shore, a collection of his later plays, contains only a sampling of his later, more abstract works. Early scripts, such as Bus Stop, which first established his reputation and revolutionized theater in China, are unfortunately unavailable in English. Only as more translations become available will English readers become aware of the scope of Gao's talent and why he is so deserving of the Nobel.	2001-07-26

While other contemporary accounts are mostly small in their scope, and unapologetically biased towards either the Communists or the Nationalists, Thunder Out of China is brutally fair, sympathetic to the Nationalists while exposing their corruption, and detailing the incompentence of the American intervention which resulted in a resumption of the disasterous civil war 1945-1949. The book covers such disasters as the Hunan famine, the farce of Chinese &quot;resistance&quot; to the Japanese invaders, the recalcitrant corruption and conservatism of the Nationalist leaders, and the sacking of Stillwell.<br />Snow's Red Star Over China may be more readable, but it's chatty, personal, pro-Red, and semi-fictionalized account is much less revealing historically than Thunder Out of China. Time was unapologetically, even fanatically, supportive of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, and the magazine's propaganda in the US explains much of America's distastrous intervention (read China Hands for more on this).

They're the sort of scripts that probably make for very interesting plays when performed, but make for rather tedius reading. Some scripts make for very enjoyable literature, but Gao's are a little too &quot;artsy&quot; to work in print alone. I recommend &quot;The Other Shore&quot; for serious readers only: dramatists, academics, and the hardcore Chinese literature enthusiast. Casual readers, merely curious about this year's Nobel winner, should avoid this collection and instead read Gao's novel, &quot;Soul Mountain&quot;, which is much more accessible.	2001-01-19

The first book to be written on modern Shanghai does quite well despite it's lack of predecessors. The author focuses on the economic and political sides of Shanghai's reemergence, but throws in some fascinated social and cultural angles as well. Well-researched and academically solid, it is nonetheless peppered throughout with a good appreciation of the many humorous ironies of modern China and makes for an enjoyable read.<br />The author is not only well-versed in her subject; her fondness for the city is evident, which is one reason the book is so engaging. For some it will provide a fascinating and enlightening introduction to Shanghai as it is, more seasoned Shanghai hands will recognize names and experiences while having such aspects as the inner workings of Shanghai's political mechanizations revealed as never before.<br />Although New Shanghai shortchanges the areas of arts and culture, and can be a little repetitive in emphasizing its main points, it's overall an excellent book that I recommend highly.	2000-10-21

But while those foreigners were drinking themselves silly all hours of the day, the city's Chinese residents were building up a world of art and letters that China had not since been able to rival.<br />Authors with a revolutionary bent are better known these days in China. The Chinese Communist Party posthumously revived Lu Xun as a standard bearer, and many other social critics such as Mao Dun, Bing Xin, and Ba Jin saw Communism as the natural out-growth of their ideals. Others, however, were more romantic, more bourgeois, more purely artistic in their vision. They, along with most of Shanghai's leading film-makers, actors, and musicians, flocked en masse to Hong Kong after 1949. Today, Old Shanghai films and literature are far better known and more popular in Hong Kong than they are in Shanghai.<br />That's where Leo Ou-Fan Lee fits into the picture. The Hong Kong native is one of the leading experts on the literary legacy of Old Shanghai, and he brings alive the writing and history of greats such as Zhang Ailing (Eileen Chang) for connoisseurs and novices alike. Lee offers a chapter on the Shanghai film industry, which is not his specialty and is not very strongly presented, apart from an interesting analysis of themes of modernity. His presentation of the huge publishing world pictorial magazines, with glossy spreads and advertisements that are indicative of societal norms and values at the time, proves quite engaging. Granted, the analysis seems to be based on just a few vintage copies of &quot;Liang You&quot; (Young Companion), but as that was a darn good magazine, one can't criticize. His real passion, however, and the strength of the book, are in the literary field. Lee seems to have a bit of a crush on Zhang Ailing, but then again, who doesn't?	2000-09-25
