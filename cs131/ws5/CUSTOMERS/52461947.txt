US	52461947	R118KZ7MS2QTBZ	0451183851	511428937	Miss Caroline's Deception	Books	2	5	5	N	N	Misleading back cover blurb, moral issues	From the back cover: <br />LIGHTSKIRT OR LADY? <br /> <br />She was a creature of tantalizing mystery. Was she a lady born and bred or a lightskirt in disguise? Was she a wife or a mistress on the run from scandal? The young woman who called herself Miss Caroline would reveal nothing of her past, not even her last name. <br /> <br />All that the handsome Earl of Rycote knew was that she was in his house, her fate was in his hands, and her beauty was doing disturbing things to his heart. As for Miss Caroline herself, she dared not reveal the truth about herself, or yield to the earl's advances--even as the peril pursuing her came closer, and the danger of Rycote's mounting desire was beginning to match her own... <br /> <br />Camy here: <br />The story opened magnificently with a great hook and intriguing situation, but I was very disappointed at how misleading the back cover blurb was. The true storyline is that the Earl and his sister encounter a pregnant woman and her maid on the mail coach, and out of kindness allow her to stay with them at their mother's house. During the night, she loses the baby and confides in her new friends that she is escaping an abusive husband who had plotted to kill her because she can't produce a male heir. <br /> <br />The attraction between hero and heroine develops well and slowly, but I was completely turned off by it because the heroine was still married. The hero didn't make much effort to stop the attraction, and his moral flexibility lost my reader sympathy for him. He also didn't seem to do much besides respond to the problems and dangers besetting the heroine. He had problems of his own, but didn't really have a game plan to solve them. It made it kind of a boring read, and he seemed very 2-dimensional. So did many of the secondary characters. <br /> <br />Caroline's character is sympathetic and a bit stubborn, but not to the point of making illogical or dangerous choices. The story moves quickly from the countryside to London, so the reader is entertained by different locales and social situations. <br /> <br />An unusual storyline, but morally not my cup of tea.	2005-07-24

It has a twisted, complex criminal, an emotionally tangling plot, and a powerful spiritual message. <br /> <br />This is definitely more graphic than previous books. The prologue gives the reader a very good feel for the intensity level to expect. Christian readers who might be frightened or disturbed by the violence of the crimes can gauge their comfort level after reading the first two pages. <br /> <br />I personally was not too disturbed by the violence of the crimes. It added to the suspense, and it also made me feel more for the characters threatened by the serial murderer, who is very creepy. <br /> <br />It was nice to see the main character Annie push herself harder in her profession, her courage, and her faith. I related to her weaknesses but I also cheered her acts of bravery, her steps of growth. <br /> <br />The spiritual thread reminded me in vivid prose of the supernatural might of Christians' prayers. Brandilyn herself is a valiant, sensitive prayer warrior, and it was riveting to read the power-filled prayer lives she describes in Annie and her friends. <br /> <br />The plot twists and builds tension without becoming confusing. I didn't guess the identity of the murderer until a few pages before it was revealed. <br /> <br />This kind of intense character and crime might appeal to teenagers, especially considering the kinds of hacker/slasher horror films they're bombarded with. This storyline has a Godly message that I personally believe might speak to teens in a way that a Sunday sermon might not, and I wouldn't hesitate to loan this book to any of the high school students I work with in my church youth group. <br /> <br />I'm looking forward to the fourth and final book, coming out in January 2006.	2005-07-04

When an outsider turns up dead, it'll take more than a steaming mocha espresso-and her unpredictable yet intriguing Wesley-to save Ruby from the danger. <br /> <br />Camy here: <br />Once again, Ruby Taylor saves the day with her unique brand of strength and sass, flavored with the bittersweet of her inner fears and insecurities. It all makes for a very likable, sympathetic character. <br /> <br />I thought that this book sparkled with more humor than the other two. Ruby's sarcasm knows no bounds, and some scenes border on slapstick. <br /> <br />In contrast, this book also seemed to delve deeper into the intricacies of a relationship between a godly man and woman. Ruby faces her preconceived notions and the struggle to be authentic and vulnerable rather than hide behind her usual self-sufficiency. <br /> <br />The ending is satisfying without being cheesy. The book entirely lived up to my expectations of an entertaining, engrossing read.	2005-07-04

Enjoying a spring afternoon of shopping with her relatives, Miss Julia Allard could not be better chaperoned with the Royal Navy by her side. Even so, a handsome stranger catches up to her, and before she knows what's happening, Miss Allard is in his arms--being kissed!    The young lady slaps the assailant, of course, but not before her reputation has been fairly tarnished--and the memory of his passionate kiss forever sealed on her lips. The stranger in question, the Duke of Kelbourne, has made a name for himself with such roguish acts. Now, to allay rumors, the mortified Miss Allard must cut short her Season and return home, where she'll concoct an elaborate plan to exact her revenge. Little does she know, however, that the duke aslo has some plans up his rakish sleeve . . .    Camy here:  This kept my interest from page one until the end. I really felt for Julia when the Duke's selfish act threatened her reputation not just in London but also back home in the country.    There are maybe a few too many characters to keep straight and a little bit of narrative head-hopping. Also, the heroine's revenge plan had several holes in it, but the plot made it seem like the only option available to a bitter and angry young woman with no other resources. I just thought it was a bit silly for her not to realize the Duke is much more experienced and might see through her inconsistent behavior. However, this sort of revenge plan has been dealt with much less adroitly in other books I've read, and it was nice to see it done in this novel with both elegance and good emotional impact.    The Inciting Incident in the prologue--the life-changing kiss--is terrific and shocking, and the motivations for the hero and heroine coming together again in Bath to kick off the story is both cute and plausible. The confrontation between hero and heroine near the end has excellent, dramatic dialogue, and the HEA scene issatisfying without being too cheesy. I did think the short epilogue was cheesy, but the last sentence was romantic.    I would definitely read another of Ms. Woodward's novels. Very entertaining.	2005-06-21

Regency fans know that waltzing before given permission by the Patronesses and being seen kissing a man at a ball are both horribly scandalous. I was hooked as to what would happen next.    What I didn't like about the story is subjective, because these elements might appeal to other Regency readers. I personally don't care for very young heroines, and Madeline is 18, just 4 months shy of 19 years old. Her actions and words are in keeping with her age, but they just didn't appeal to me. She's very nave, rather silly, and a bit hoydenish. She's also kind and usually tries to speak the truth rather than being deceptive, but her wild schemes and silly behavior were off-putting at times.    The hero also didn't capture me. He vacillated between disapproving and sexy, which seemed a bit extreme for me. The physical attraction between them didn't really move me, but that again is very subjective, and another reader might find those scenes hotter than a cyprian's boudoir.    The characters' actions throughout the book remain satisfyingly consistent. Nothing out of synch with how the characters were written, no moments of \\"Now why did he do that when he said this before?\\" I was never jarred out of the story by strange choices or inconsistent behavior.    I especially liked the interaction between Madeline and her younger cousin Frederick. It is so refreshing and funny, because although they profess to dislike each other, it's obvious they enjoy each others' company very much. Their banter is cute and breezy. The interaction between Madeline and her duenna is similar, with tongue-in-cheek dialogue and gentle sarcasm. Mrs. Benjamin is a bit stereotypical of a life-long family retainer, but she is a very good foil to Madeline's volatile personality.    I thought that the plot events (I won't disclose them here) were well done. The humorous things that happened moved the story along at a good pace-not too fast, but not meandering either.    I guess I'm a bit oblivious since I didn't notice the contemporary flavor of the dialogue that the previous reviewer mentioned. I am also American and wouldn't know a fake British accent from a real one, so anything slightly formal seems authentic to me. Because this is most definitely a Regency romp or a farce, the dancing lessons and the more blatant plot devices didn't knock me out of the story world. A more exacting Regency reader might care, but I certainly didn't.    In all, this book was entertaining but I just didn't care for the heroine's character. It didn't turn me off of this author, at any rate, and I would read another title of hers.	2005-04-24

I took it up again when I was eating a solitary dinner tonight, and it was so riveting that I finished dinner and kept reading. <br /> <br />This is a bit different from the normal fare from Steeple Hill, in a good way. The author never writes about body parts or sexual innuendos, but the chemistry between the hero and heroine is almost tangible. What a rush to read some of their scenes. This is a hero I can swoon over (don't let the pastor-lookalike on the cover fool you, the hero is rough-and-tumble and sexy as sin . . . well, in a Christ-like way. LOL). <br /> <br />The heroine is a bit like Jamie from \\"A Walk to Remember,\\" sweet and innocent. But Julia is also real--struggling to understand the paradoxes between the teachings of her \\"Shepherd\\" and the Truth in the Bible. <br /> <br />The topic of cults and toxic churches is very appropriate in these days when many churches deviate from the Bible and follow man-made rules. Julia's church talks \\"church speak\\" but doesn't act as Jesus would, and the members ultimately care only about themselves while professing to be sacrificing the world for God. There is no room for grace, no service for others. It is all appearance, not Christ's love. It's frighteningly like the modern world. <br /> <br />The prose flows seamlessly and I got sucked into the story. The writing is masterful--each character is unique and distinct, there are no clichs or stereotypes here. Despite Julia's sheltered upbringing, I found myself liking her and relating to her as she fought to gain her self-esteem, her identity in God. <br /> <br />I have already pre-ordered the author's next book, \\"Pocketful of Pearls,\\" which also discusses toxic churches and other tough issues. This is totally refreshing Inspirational Romance.	2005-04-13

She can organize a four-hankie chick-flickathon with a wave of her tall, nonfat, double mocha. And she's a shoo-in for the job of her dreams--movie reviewer for the newspaper where she works. <br /> <br />Enter Alex Spencer--not only gorgeous but also a film buff, perfectly cast for a celluloid kiss and a fade to sunset. Unfortunately, Alex is the villain who sends Phoebe packing to the last place on earth she wants to be--back home to boring little Barley, California. <br /> <br />But wait. It couldn't be. Dark, handsome, and annoying Alex . . . in Barley? <br /> <br />Can Phoebe protect her hometown--and her heart--and prove It's a Wonderful Life? Or is her promising future truly Gone With the Wind? <br /> <br />Camy here: <br />Fabulous! Hilarious writing--dialogue, scenes, characters--I was laughing my tail off. The humor is truly witty, versus sarcastic put-downs. <br /> <br />The characters are genuine people I cared about and related to. Phoebe Grant is more like \\"everygirl\\" with her obsessions and outlook on life. Phoebe struggles with her single status and nagging relatives just like Bridget Jones, but with less emphasis on sex as the basis for attraction and more on the personality differences. <br /> <br />Readers who have attended Christian Singles' groups at their own churches will find Phoebe's group both funny and frighteningly familiar. The characters are not over-the-top, but they stand out as caricatures of anyone's real life friends. <br /> <br />The movie trivia peppered in the prose makes things interesting. I had seen some of the movies mentioned, although not all of them, but it didn't matter because the references are always explained and I felt as hip as matinee-hopping Phoebe. It made me put those old movies on my Netflix queue. Haha. <br /> <br />This was fabulous entertainment from page one to theend. I wouldn't hesitate to hand it to any high school girl because it's good, clean fun, although the fears about getting older and being single might go over the heads of young women who are nowhere near the 3-0 mark. I found this on par with Kristin Billerbeck's Ashley Stockingdale series, but with a very different sort of heroine who is nevertheless equally endearing.	2005-04-13

Parker's brilliant mind is contrasted by his weakened body, making the reader admire him for his abilities and sympathize with him as the underdog. <br /> <br />Clues unfold piece by piece in the drama around Parker's accidental discovery of a possible cure for MS. Olson deftly braids various plot threads together and apart as the story progresses, joining everything together at the end for a satisfying and realistic conclusion. <br /> <br />There is constant danger in every chapter and exciting scenes that kept me up all night finishing this book. The title is very appropriate. <br /> <br />The geek speak is at a minimum. I had no troubles understanding the scientific background of the storyline. <br /> <br />This is an excellent contemporary take on Jekyll and Hyde, with a splash of medical science fiction and an intense portrayal of the protagonists' emotional and spiritual struggles with \\"wholeness.\\" It is a plot-driven book, but the characters leap off the page and come to life. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to any teenager, boy or girl, in my youth group, and any adult suspense fan.	2005-03-27

Each character is vivid and distinct, the action slams along non-stop, and the mystery keeps you absorbed until the end.    There is a small bit of geek speak to explain the quantum computer the bad guys are after. However, if the average reader doesn't quite understand the underlying scientific principles, it doesn't detract from enjoyment in this story.    Along with the aura of danger, Ingermanson's quirky signature humor is woven into the pages without dissipating the tension. He gives accurate portrayals of the dot-com companies, the high-tech atmosphere, and the culture of southern California.    The characters are larger-than-life, with abilities to awe the reader and personalities to make you root for them. A romance thread keeps you guessing until the last page, literally.    The spiritual thread is both subtle and not. Nothing \\"in your face\\" or overtly evangelical, but this clean fiction will both entertain and provide insight into how true Christians think and live.    I have no qualms about lending this book to teenaged boys in my church youth group--it has the action to keep them riveted but also the clear message of Christian living, right decisions, standing up for truth.	2005-03-27

The loss of two major characters is not quite made up for by the colorful new Vicar, but the new character is vibrant, unexpected and perfect for the atmosphere of the story.    The main character Theodora seems to have become less shallow in this book, delving into deeper questions and more inner searching. It makes for a more emotional read than the first book.    Despite the differences when compared to the first book, this is still highly entertaining and a rollicking good read. Many of my friends who didn't really like the first book enjoyed this one very much.	2005-03-27

She reacts to the trials in her life out of fear--the same fears that many single Christian women face today and can relate to. She battles the safety of \\"the familiar,\\" the temptation to compromise, the pull of self-pity, the pit of unworthiness. Ashley's bounce-back attitude and child-like, rock-hard faith in God is both encouraging and challenging. I wrestled with her over her control issues with God, and was reminded of the many times I've done the same thing. <br /> <br />The characters in this book, versus \\"What a Girl Wants,\\" seem more rich, varied and distinct. The sparks that fly when different characters interact are hilarious and keep the pace moving smartly. <br /> <br />Much of the humor is very modern, for those of us with secret vices of subscriptions to Star and People Magazine in addition to our stash of Cosmopolitans. It may not appeal as strongly to the entire spectrum of readers as to the twenty-something and thirty-something urbanites, but it still zaps with humor reminiscent of old comedy films. <br /> <br />The novel captures the social and business atmosphere of Silicon Valley with its unique multiethnic aroma and science-heavy population. However, in defense of my own engineer husband, they are not all as absent-minded as some of the Reasons. ;-) <br /> <br />In all, a turbulent and ticklish look at the angst of singleness for Christian working women. An entertaining read I highly recommend.	2004-12-02

There were very suspenseful moments, well-timed, that kept the pace of the story, but somehow there didn't seem to be that tense aura of danger overshadowing the action. Center stage is the love story of Jake and Tiffany.    The plot draws Jake's change of heart with a very skillful, delicate hand. It was gradual, believable and satisfying to watch as he realizes the flaws in his preconceived notions about marriage for his life. The characters are consistent and realistic. Tiffany's own fears about her singleness and her willingness to \\"compromise\\" in order to ensure security in a married relationship are time-worn issues many single women will relate to. I didn't particularly like her snotty boyfriend, but then again, I wasn't meant to.    The author handled the faith element with skill and elegance. Nothing \\"in your face\\" or preachy, no \\"Christian-ese\\" language or blind, unrealistic belief. It was wonderfully satisfying to see Inspirational fiction written with such natural grace.    In all, a lovely romance, well-written and entertaining. I look forward to more from this author.	2004-12-01

It starts off with heart-pounding suspense that hooked me from the start. The drama of Ruby's broken family and broken spirit is interspersed with the clues of a suspected murder, and it really kept my attention glued to the page. <br /> <br />Ruby's character is real and flawed, utterly believable and easy to relate to for those of us with past mistakes. She's like anyone who is trying to overcome bad decisions--she whines, genuflects, denies, avoids, rages against, obsesses over and beats herself up for her damaged psyche, but she moves forward with pain, terror, and a tenuous trust in her God. <br /> <br />It is both a murder mystery and a diary of Ruby's struggles amidst her growing faith. I could relate to her self-doubts, her guilt, her feelings of unworthiness. She always turned to God for help, but it never came easily or smoothly. It showed with stark realism the difficulty of trusting and submitting. <br /> <br />I especially liked the foray into the disdainful attitude of academia toward Christianity, which I had experienced in college. The author handles the subject with no holds barred and no easy answer, but provides a blanket of comfort as Ruby wrestles with the topic in both herself and with her coworkers. <br /> <br />There is a bit more sensuality in this novel than in the first Ruby Taylor mystery, \\"Romance Rustlers and Thunderbird Thieves.\\" I liked how Ruby's push-pull relationship with Wesley is so gritty and full of mistakes and yet so familiar to all of us who've been burned by love, who desire to change and honor God in a Christ-centered relationship. Ruby and Wesley are both flawed people trying to find their way toward each other, trying to overcome the habits and behaviors of the past. <br /> <br />The Chick-Lit feel of the narrative kept my attention with Ruby's quirky metaphors and humorous outlook on her crazy life. I think that many Post-Modern Generation readers will like the atmosphere of the prose and relate to Ruby's thinking. <br /> <br />Sharon Dunn just keeps getting better. I'm looking forward to the third installment of the Ruby Taylor Mystery series, scheduled for 2005.	2004-12-01

Witty writing without being overly sarcastic, clever characterization that keeps each person rich and intriguing in the reader's mind. <br /> <br />Theodora is refreshingly realistic. She is not smart, beautiful or even particularly spiritual at the start of the book, but she is likable and her adventures are fun to follow. She is a colorful personality, and the people surrounding her are equally interesting--her Greek-obsessed mother, football-crazed plumber boyfriend, the Aussie Reverend \\"Digger\\" Graves, and maternal Pollyanna Mrs. Hubble. Each of them makes the plot vibrant and fast-paced. They are all consistent, and any emotional and spiritual changes are both believable and satisfying. <br /> <br />The faith element is handled with tongue-in-cheek, but also with a skilled painter's brush. The Christian stereotypes are all present, and somehow they are both endearing and laughable. This comical backdrop, however, only enhances the brilliance of characters like Miss Chamberlain, who radiate Christ. <br /> <br />The pun-ny writing is laugh-out-loud (or groan-out-loud) funny, reflecting dry British humor. I loved the way the prose rambled along, interspersed with moments of cheekiness that almost took me by surprise. I loved the lack of jaded sophistication, the absence of the kind of biting sarcasm that seems to always be putting someone down. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this book enough. I have to mention, however, that there are several references that are purely British in nature, and may not seem that funny to an American reader. My husband had no idea what a \\"bloke\\" was, while I found reference to a \\"Bible for Blokes\\" uproarious. <br /> <br />Fun reading. I can't help thinking that fans of Betty Neels would enjoy this book. I can't wait to read the sequel, \\"Theodora's Wedding.\\"	2004-12-01

ADRIAN D'AVIGNON  Level-headed, even-tempered college professor Adrian D'Avignon has always feared the day her adopted children's biological uncle would return. She knew he would disrupt the even tenor of their lives; she never suspected he would wreak havoc on her heart, her security, and her solid walk with the Lord.    Held together by the twins and a desperate desire to discover the past that has brought them to this tangled present, Neil and Adrian search for a compromise only to discover complete dependence on God reveals the way He so lovingly prepared -- long before they met and loved.    Camy here:  I loved the fact that this is one of the more gritty and realistic Inspirational Romances I've ever read. There are no goody-goody Christians in this book. Even the most saintly example has very real, hurtful flaws.    This is definitely a Christian book with obvious Christian themes, but the author presents the Christian walk without icing, showing each character's confusion, doubt, struggle and despair. But ultimately each finds their way to dependence upon a God who had a larger picture in mind, despite the hurtful incidents of the past.    There is definitely more sensuality in this book than in other Inspirational Romances, but the characters struggle against and resist the lure of premarital sex in a very realistic manner. No chaste kisses and strong-as-steel self-control on the part of hero or heroine, which helps the reader relate to them even more.    The book is presented almost like a mystery as the unknown motivations of dead characters come to light. I was hooked, curious to discover the tragic events of the past along with the hero andheroine.    The author often switches POV midway in longer scenes, but it is always indicated with a scene break in the narrative. The dialogue is extremely realistic, but sometimes slows the narrative pace a bit.    On a whole, an entertaining romance with flawed but struggling characters that the reader can relate to. I read this on the heels of Dee Henderson's \\"God's Gift\\" and found the writing styles a bit similar, with true-to-life personalities and repartee.	2004-11-19

As in \\"Brink of Death,\\" the novel opens like the gentle prelude to a symphony, then screeches off like a tire-burning corvette disappearing down the street. I started reading it Sunday afternoon and couldn't stop until I finished that night. <br /> <br />Annie Kingston's character was complex, and I could relate to her inner fears, spiritual questions and maternal ferocity. She was not a superwoman performing feats of courage or displaying acute intellectual insight. She was a real woman like me or anyone else, caught in a dire situation. Her questions about God echoed what I asked when I was seeking Him, and the minor characters answered with gentleness, honesty, and empathy. <br /> <br />The villain Bland was drawn with such vivid description that I could envision his face, hear his voice. He character had immense depth and richness. Annie literally crawled into his head and dragged the reader with her as she discovered who he was under the surface, what made up the mind of this ruthless man. <br /> <br />Even the minor characters--Annie's children, her sister, etc.--had that aura of realism that made them colorful and varied. I could name someone I knew who reminded me of each character. This aspect drew me into the story quickly because I felt like I knew these people, they were familiar to me. <br /> <br />There was a doozy of a plot twist near the end, and Brandilyn did a very good job leading up to it. However, I think I've read too much Agatha Christie, because I guessed the plot twist in the first quarter of the book. But that being said, it didn't make the ending any less heart-pounding, nail-biting, or satisfying. <br /> <br />You don't really need to read the first book to enjoy this sequel, but \\"Brink of Death\\" does add to the backstory and introduces character relationships that, in this novel, are subtly shifting and growing. While \\"Brink of Death\\" was more plot-driven, \\"Stain of Guilt\\" is definitely more character-driven.It's primarily the cast of this play that keeps the reader's attention, with the story action as background movement. <br /> <br />In all, I highly recommend this title. A very engrossing read.	2004-10-27

I thought this was a terrific story. I'm very satisfied with the way Kathy Tyers rewrote her original \\"Shivering World.\\" She writes so intelligently, I have to--I WANT to--read slowly to absorb and follow what's going on. She has SUCH an incredible grasp of sociology and politics and power struggles, it blows my mind. It makes the characters, their actions, and the storyline emminently believable. I'm also a biologist, so following how she imagines biological science will \\"evolve\\" in the future is intriguing to me. <br /> <br />Her novels are always incredibly deep and colorful and complex. The characters in this rewrite of the original story are rich and varied--each has something important to win or lose, which drives their actions. No one is two-dimensional. Well, except for the research technician with the three-sentence role. :-) The book ends on a satisfying note, but it also ends in a way that could segue into a sequel or a series like her Firebird trilogy. I hope that's in the works, I'd be totally excited. The characters she has created in this book have enough conflicts and chemistry to pull that off, I believe. <br /> <br />I'd buy this book for any science-fiction lover. The author has created a sweeping canvas with infinite possibilities in this fictional world and its characters. I am hoping she's writing more in this setting.	2004-09-25

Randy Ingermanson's action raced along and his prose was so engaging that I couldn't put it down.    From the back cover:    Jerusalem, A.D. 66    The City of God seethes with rage against imperial Rome...and, in an act of unspeakable brutality, Rome takes deadly retribution. War looms on the horizon--but one woman already knows the outcome...    Transported from the far future, Rivka Meyers has made her home in Jerusalem with her husband and fellow time traveler, Ari Kazan. But in a turbulent age, Rivka's foreknowledge of history is a heavy responsibility. She knows Jerusalem will be destroyed--and that a prophet will warn the fledgling church to flee the city. Is Rivka herself that prophet? And if so, will the people heed her warning?    Rivka's fears deepen when Jewish zealots demand Ari's help to design weapons of war. Ari faces the impossible choice: join the \\"men of violence\\" in their doomed cause, or leave the people defenseless against Nero's legions.    Desperate to know God's will, Ari and Rivka are about to face the cost of forgiveness...gain an unexpected ally...and learn the extraordinary power of sacrifice.    Camy again:  I don't read many historical novels, but this was a mix of both history and science fiction because the main characters were from our near future, stuck in the ancient past through the actions of a theoretical physicist. I've heard that time-travel is actually theorized in physics, although I would never understand the complex mathematics, so the characters' plight wasn't through a magical talisman or something that *Bibbity-bobbity-boo* zapped them back in time. This dabbled in the realm of possibility, which is rather neat. The author has a short, amusing article on time travel on his website, as well as a couple historical articles that relate to this series.    I've heard about the historical account of Josephus but never read his work. However, I thoroughly enjoyed how the author revealed and compared eventstranspiring with the slightly exaggerated writings of Josephus and other historians. The way the plot unfolded was intriguing and surprising. Things never fell into a predicted pattern or lost their richness, even though all the events were taken from actual historical writings.    Each character, whether good or evil, was very complex. No one was a cardboard cutout, not from the most devout Rabbi to the most evil Roman. It added incredible emotional depth to the story.    Slight warning here: the author described a true Roman crucifixion, which was a horrific thing, not the white-washed images of the Renaissance painters. The violence might offend some readers used to the typical fare of most CBA publishers.    This is third in the author's City of God series. Before reading RETRIBUTION, I had not read TRANSGRESSION (book 1) but I did read PREMONITION (book 2). This book stands alone, but I do believe that reading PREMONITION (book 2) made this novel much more enjoyable, because I had already come to care for the main characters, had seen their struggles and conflicts in PREMONITION (book 2). Many of those conflicts are related to the struggles in RETRIBUTION (book 3).    Kathy Tyers, author of SHIVERING WORLD and her FIREBIRD trilogy, endorses this novel and mentions that she \\"devoured the book and wished it were longer.\\" I was exactly the same. Randy Ingermanson's writing style was fascinating, and the characters so 3-dimensional I could almost touch and talk to them. The ending came as a bit of a shock because I wanted there to be more.    Excellent writing--technically exemplary, if you follow Dwight Swain's method--and a very character-driven storyline. The plot twisted and moved so quickly that I really felt like I was on a roller coaster. I intend to buy more copies of this book to give away. I think it would appeal to a large range of readers.	2004-09-04

The heroine, Ruby Taylor, is real and gritty, and non-Christian at the beginning of the book. She's awesome.    Her hero/love interest is also a \\"real\\" Christian guy, still suffering through the mistakes he made in his own past. I've been so tired of so-called \\"tortured\\" heroes, where it turns out their only sin is a decision made in ignorance that resulted in something bad happening to them. Puh-leeze. Give me a REAL man--someone who made a bad decision with eyes wide open, and is still struggling with the consequences, trying to depend on Christ, trying to make the right decisions now.    Ruby's mother has the same colorful past and realistic, 3-dimensional character. I'm looking forward to reading about her and Maryanne in the next book, \\"Sassy Cinderella and the Valiant Vigilante,\\" and the third book in the series, which isn't published yet.    The mystery unfolds well. Also, Ruby's decision for Christ is treated with a gentle hand, not too preachy or \\"in your face.\\"    I highly recommend this read. Amazon and Amazon Marketplace have good prices on this book, too. There's also overstock.com.	2004-06-30
US	52461947	R1JS8EBGOGUBL	0849944589	412698110	What a Girl Wants (Ashley Stockingdale, Book 3)	Books	5	10	13	N	N	For the post-modern Christian	\\"What a Girl Wants\\" really is laugh-out-loud funny.  I haven't been this entertained in a long while.  Racy, edgy and romantic WITHOUT a gratuitous sex scene every other chapter.  The heroine Ashley is a real character, NOT a generic super-Christian woman with a sweet smile and a heart of gold who the hero instantly falls in love with (but not in lust) and wants to marry.  No, Ashley is like any girl I'll meet at Valley Fair or Stanford Shopping Center.<br />As a post-modern Christian, I can entirely relate to Ashley.  Her sassy, sarcastic attitude and neuroses are WAY too familiar.  Her faith is entirely central to her life, as indicated by her thoughts and decisions, but the way she talks about it is in language that is different from our parents' generation of Christians.  The language can come across as flippant and slightly irreverent, but it's the way she makes God more real, more personal and more intimate in her life.  For Ashley, God is her friend (albeit a pretty powerful and absolutely holy Friend) rather than Thou-Almighty-God-Maker-of-Heaven-and-Earth.<br />The book is great at showing Ashley's spiritual journey from a more distant relationship with God to a fully submissive and joyful interaction with her Creator.  It doesn't preach.  It shows the actions of a woman of God who makes mistakes and needs constant guidance and direction from her Lord, which is how He wants us to be anyway.  It is culturally hip and trendy, so that a world inundated by reality TV, web-access pocket PCs, and other forms of ultra-stimulation can relate and laugh and maybe even question the material things they value.<br />The book perfectly captures the essence of northern California--the attitudes, the environment, the ENGINEERS (I can say that since I married one).  The social culture is brought to life and drawn with both love and tongue in cheek.  The author brilliantly colors the ethnic melting pot that is the San Francisco Bay Area.<br />As a hopeless romantic, I'm sometimes left flat by many women's fiction novels, but this book has enough sparks to light the San Francisco Airport runway.  I highly recommend this to any romance reader.<br />This is terrific entertainment, and a message suitable for those of us post-moderns who struggle with what the world says and what God wants.  In Ashley, I see the other Christians of my generation who don't want to be influenced by the morals of the world we live in, but at the same time don't want to be total hermit-recluse-bananas in our own exclusive Christian circle.   Ashley's discovery of how to be herself, be content, and be God's child is a worthwhile spiritual take-away.	2004-05-19
US	52461947	R1FAHWIJ68K5SB	0821736035	646010710	A Touch of Scandal	Books	5	3	3	N	N	One of my all-time favorites...	Back cover:<BR>A DISHONORED GENTLEMAN. Once a brilliant government figure, Viscount Gideon Carne had fled England amid scandal and betrayal.  Determined to rebuild his life, he returned at last to find his once-successful firm suspiciously on the verge of ruin.  An alliance with Fiona Alastair -- the very lady he'd wounded most grievously years before -- was his only hope.  The ever-gracious Fiona agreed to be of help on one condition: that the end of their enterprise bring an end to their relationship.  But this promise proved more easily made than kept, for Gideon soon found himself ensnared by the lady's enchanting beauty...and devilishly tempted to put honor aside in favor of passion!<br />A SCANDALOUS LADY.  Only a fool would lose her heart twice to a rake like Gideon Carne.  Already disgraced once at the hands of the handsome lord, Fiona had no intention of repeating her mistake.  But as she and Gideon began their dangerous investigation into his business affairs, there was no denying the feelings that once again flared between them.  And as she gazed into Gideon's demanding dark eyes, Fiona realized with a start that even the best of intentions could lead to the most shocking of conclusions!<br />This is the first book of an exciting series of interrelated books, followed by \\"An Improper Proposal\\" and \\"A Sensible Match.\\"  The blurb from the back does not do it justice--the plot development is excellent and follows smoothly and logically.  Character development is also rich, complex and believeable.  No &quot;too stupid to live&quot; characters here!  The plot twists are intricate and exciting, and each character is vibrant and unique.  I especially loved Fiona's character, as a level-headed young woman rather than a flighty or reckless chit with few brains.<br />The characters introduced here go on to star in their own romances, which are both equally as engrossing a read.  I would highly recommend this book to any Regency lover--it was one of my first Regencies and still remains a very memorable favorite.	2003-09-11

Back cover:<BR>LADY WITH A PAST<BR>Susanna Bowen was disgraced during a disastrous first Season -- and has posed as a widow ever since to prevent further entanglements.  Now she has been offered a home and independence -- if the shamed miss can steer her troublesome cousin Juliet toward an acceptable match.  But things go shockingly awry when a highwayman steals Juliet's heart en route to London -- and brazenly presents Susannah's charge with a calling card purloined from the Marquess of Warne.<br />MARQUESS WITH A MISSION<BR>A man hiding his own painful secrets, Warne is incensed over the theft of his personal property -- and determined to unmask the blackguard responsible.  But that will inevitably place the sad, private peer in close contact with an equally guarded Susannah.  And when lovelorn souls travel together, there's no telling what amorous turns the road might take.<br />This is such an excellent book -- the plot development is logical, complex and engaging.  While character development is consistent, it also reveals the intimate emotional changes that occur in each player as events unfold, creating a wholly believable story of scarred hearts struggling to overcome past mistakes and abuses.  This is so much more than a romance -- it is a beautiful story that keeps the reader hooked until the last page.  I highly recommend this one to any Regency romance reader.	2003-09-11

The writer's style is nice, with good, believeable dialogue, no stupid lines, and just the right amount of narration to bring more spice and understanding to the ensuing scenes.<br />I did not find it as philosophically deep as the previous reviewer, but I agree that this book is very good and very fast-paced in it's plot development.  It is an entertaining read, with likeable, intelligent main characters and satisfyingly evil villains.<br />Phillipa's younger brother dies mysteriously while at a boys' school, and while grief-striken and drunk, her father mumbles indiscreetly about what his friend had written to him about suspicious goings-on there.  When Phillipa is unexpectedly supplied with a convenient alibi, she determines to go there to investigate herself.<br />The transition from lady to maid is difficult, to say the least--the hard labor, abuse, and occasional persecution from the  bullying masters shocks her and tests her mettle, but Phillipa is made of stern stuff.  In the midst of her bewildering and exhausting first days, she meets and falls in love with the history master, who protects her from a dangerous master and seems to care for her, as well.<br />But Phillipa is NOT a maid, and she is anguished that the woman he falls in love with is NOT her true self.  But what she doesn't know is that her tall, dark history master is not himself, either.  She KNOWS he is playing a deep game...the problem is that she just doesn't know what it is...<br />After the episode at the boys' school (with a dramatic ending to that in itself), Phillipa is off to London for her third Season...but she meets too many familiar characters there...<br />The description of Phillippa's time as a scullery maid is gratifyingly more realistic than I had expected, with emphasis on the hardships involved.  I had expected a more unrealistic situation where a high-born lady masquerades as a proud, outspoken scullery maid and no one notices or remarks on the maid's very unservile behavior...but the author surprised me, and the plot moved well and believeably.<br />The ending especially is rife with misunderstandings and near-misses and coincidences.  The book moves well in the midst of all these twists, and is not too frustrating for the reader, with an easily followed storyline.  I think it is a more extensive and complicated plot than many more recently published Regencies I've read--there are more supporting characters than on the average--but I tend to like that better.  Too few characters can sometimes make the storyline dry and the plot scenes too predictable.<br />Characters are consistent throughout the book, which is something I personally appreciate.  It was also very nice to have intelligent main characters to follow, rather than characters who ignore the more obvious clues and muddle in ignorance while the reader writhes in frustration!<br />A pleasant read for a rainy day.  It's a keeper for my shelves, at least.  I'm looking forward to any more of this author's books that I happen to come across.	2001-04-07

The plot moves well and the characters are well-drawn and consistent,  evoking anger, sympathy, humor from the reader.<br />Cordelia Hardy is from  America, where her English-born father has amassed a ridiculously vulgar  fortune in trade.  Spurred by his naturally aggressive personality and his  intense love for his daughter, Augustus Hardy has returned to England to  purchase a title for Cordelia, in the form of a husband.<br />The impoverished  Duke of Overslate is the cousin of Cordelia's one true friend in London,  Mrs. Susannah Southbie.  Overcoming his distaste for such a state as  marriage--and marriage to an AMERICAN!--Harry agrees to meet Cordelia.   Susannah introduces the Duke to Mr. Hardy and his daughter, and Harry is  intrigued by the shy but intelligent Cordelia in spite of himself.  She is  not pretty, or outgoing, but her manner is sweet and gentle.  She is not  what the Duke would have expected a Duchess to be, but he is not unhappy  with the financial agreement he reaches with Mr. Hardy.<br />His awkwardness  with women and his inexperience with the opposite sex put him at a  disadvantage, and he mistakenly gives Cordelia the impression that he loves  her when he is proposing to her.  Cordelia had loved him at first sight,  and although she is genuinely surprised by his proposal, her shock gives  way to joy and happiness.  Her doting father cannot bring himself to tell  the naive girl that he had arranged for the marriage like he arranged his  other business ventures.<br />The soon-to-be Duchess is an instant success in  the society that had scorned and snubbed Cordelia only weeks before.  But  it is when she visits Overslate Castle that she receives her most painful  exposure to the pride and haughtiness of Harry's family.  Harry had  mistakenly assumed his new bride wanted all the pomp and splendour her  father was buying for her, and the house party is lavish and overwhelming  to his new bride.  His relatives are overbearing, judgemental and scornful  of the &quot;Dollar Duchess&quot; while Harry's cousin, the beautiful and  newly widowed Lady Eastman, clearly has her relations' vote as the new  Duchess instead of this American upstart.<br />As her father is fond of  saying, Cordelia will be led, but not driven.  Yet how far can Harry's  relatives drive her with their snubs and cruelty before she digs in her  heels?  And why isn't Harry defending his fiance, and instead allowing his  cousin Lord Trevor to spend so much time with her?<br />A very satisfying  romp!  I'm looking forward to more by Rebecca Baldwin!	2000-08-11

I am a fan of Grace Livingston Hill, although I haven't yet read all of her books, but of the ones I've read, this is one of the best!  Her deep, personal faith in Jesus Christ comes shining through in each of the  characters and is absolutely beautiful and lovely in the face of the death  and destruction of war, and in comparison to the selfishness of the new,  modern generation emerging.<br />Charlie Montgomery has loved Blythe Bonniwell  for years, since they attended school together.  But Charlie has always  been poor and shy, and despite earning honors in academics and athletics,  considers himself beneath the beautiful, wealthy Blythe.  But on the eve of  his departure for a dangerous war mission, he gathers his courage and  visits her, to tell her that he has always loved her, and to say  goodbye.<br />Blythe's family has always been conservative church-goers, kind  and generous, raising her in love although not in personal faith.  But  because of her loving nature and her upbringing, she is able to recognize  the purity of Charlie's love, and with wonder and sincerity, she returns  his affections with an innocent passion.  Charlie is surprised, overjoyed  and in utter despair--he had volunteered for a mission that he will most  likely never return from.  Because his mother is dead, he thought he had  nothing to return for, and his patriotism and courage made him ideal for  such a suicide assignment.  But now, with Blythe's love following him to  the continent, his entire outlook has changed and he wonders what will  happen to them.  They exchanged no vows, no engagement plans--Charlie does  not expect to ever see her again.<br />Meanwhile, on the homefront, Blythe  busies herself with Red Cross work and befriends Mrs. Blake, a woman from  the &quot;other side of town&quot;, who also has a son in the army, Walter.   While many of the other women ignore or scorn the woman and her poverty,  Blythe makes her feel welcome and enjoys her company.  Her friendshiprewards itself, for Walter Blake has befriended his hometown hero Charlie  on the other side of the world, and is able to send a last message from  Charlie to his beloved through Mrs. Blake.<br />But Dan Seavers, a rich,  spoiled classmate of Blythe and Charlie, is courting Blythe with careless  yet single-minded attentions.  He is the colorful, harsh portrait of  selfishness that the &quot;modernism&quot; of the world has wrought in the  younger generation, denigrating the &quot;old-fashioned-ness&quot; of faith  in God and love and respect.  Blythe thinks of Dan as nothing but a  childhood playmate, but he is persistent in his pursuit.  Meanwhile,  another of Blythe's classmates, Anne, pursues Dan just as avidly as he  chases Blythe, and her petty jealousy blankets Blythe's optimism and hope  with mocking scorn and despair.<br />On the war front, Charlie has gone to  listen to a travelling speaker, Link Silverthorn, who convicts Charlie of  the sin he had never acknowledged he had, and who also brings to his eyes a  vision of Christ that moves and awakens him.  Silverthorn answers Charlie's  questions and introduces him to the love in the eyes of his Savior, and the  *recognition* Charlie sees in the face of Jesus brings him hope and peace  as he sets off for certain death.  Charlie is comforted by the deep-seated  knowledge that he *belongs* to Christ, and that God has mapped out his  steps, and is also watching over the precious girl he has left at  home.<br />Dan Seavers is threatening Blythe's parents with an elopement,  still conceitedly unaware that Blythe does not return his so-called  affections.  The people of the town make known their own opinions, but a  letter from Charlie arrives in the midst of the fray, describing his  new-found awareness of Christ, and Blythe and her parents are themselves  changed by the joy and sincerity of his words.<br />But Dan Seavers is still  lurking, Anne is still grasping and catty... And then Charlie is missing in  action...<br />I love this book and hope you will, too.  Grace Livingston Hill  is a master with words that bring to life the goodness of Christ, the  blazing glory of real love, and the hope that sustains in the midst of war.	2000-06-17

I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;A Natural Attachment&quot; and Peter Frazier, who  appeared briefly in that story, now has his own in this book.<br />Reluctantly  responding to a summons by his cousin, Lord Blakesford, Peter arrives in  time to bury his infamous relative, who has obliged the entire neighborhood  by finally and suddenly dying.  In fact, the old Lord Blakesford was so  ill-liked that apparently Peter is the ONLY person willing to bury the evil  man.  He has also suddenly become the new Lord Blakesford.<br />Temporarily  putting up in the village hotel, he has a romantic encounter with a young  woman in the moonlit garden...only to have her show up at his door the next  day, seething with anger and frustration at Lord Blakesford...the OLD Lord  Blakesford.  His deceased cousin had taken Hannah Jane's widowed mother as  mistress, then abandoned her with his illegitimate son.  Now motherless and  penniless, Hannah had swallowed her pride and written to the old Lord,  agreeing to his deliberately cruel plan to provide for his son and send him  to school--if Hannah would come and serve as his housekeeper, never seeing  her brother again.<br />Hannah suffers a shock at seeing the handsome young  man now holding the title.  She is overwhelmed by his apparent kindness in  trying to right the wrong done to her mother and brother.  Living in  Longthorpe with him and joyfully reunited with her brother, she sees  Peter's compassionate character and his desire to restore the lands to what  they once were, and to provide for his impoverished tenants.  But Peter has  a difficult time winning over the tenants, who are waiting to see if the  new Lord will follow in his numerous ancestors' greedy, evil  footsteps.<br />But Hannah has a secret of her own--her grandfather had been  Lord Delaware, who had murdered her father and nearly murdered her mother  when still carrying her as a baby.  Her mother had been able to marry an  older man who had always loved her, and who acknowledged Hannah as his own,  but Hannah could never forget that she was illegitimate, her true father a  simple footman.  Drawing propriety around her like a protective suit of  armor, she also holds herself away from Peter, since the new Lord  Blakesford cannot marry a woman of such low background.<br />But Peter MUST  marry--his cousin's extensive fortune can only be given to him when he  marries a woman deemed suitable by the executor of the will.  And he  desperately needs the money to restore Longthorpe.<br />Just at that time, the  annoying, spoiled and equally desperate Pamela Chandler shows up at Peter's  door, determined to renew her acquaintance with the new Lord  Blakesford...and Hannah, an old schoolmate of Pamela, finds herself the  object of jealousy, lies and scandal...<br />An extensive cast of well-drawn  secondary characters make this an enjoyable read.  You also don't need to  read &quot;A Natural Attachment&quot; to fully enjoy this book.	2000-06-15

Young, impulsive Josephine Middleton has been unofficially betrothed to the Duke of Mitford by their grandfathers.  She is unable to  protest to her father's and grandfather's joy of the match, but handsome  Mr. Porterhouse, who is visiting on a neighboring country estate, frightens  her to panic with lies about how haughty and cold and rakish the duke is.   Her panic escalates until the day before the duke's arrival, when she  determines to run to her Aunt Winifred, whom she is certain will support  her against her grandfather.  Mr. Porterhouse persuades her to let him  escort her, since it is only a one-day drive, but he sabotages the axle of  his carriage and strands Jo in the Crown and Anchor Inn, 10 miles from Aunt  Winifred's.  Realizing his intentions to force her to marry him, Jo gives  him the rough side of her tongue until he uses his strength to try to  ravish her.  But her screams bring help in the form of Mr. Paul Villiers,  lodged in the room next door, who plants Mr. Porterhouse a facer right  before Jo smashes a bowl over her would-be suitor's head.<br />But Mr.  Villiers is really the Duke of Mitford, travelling incognito at an attempt  at &quot;adventure&quot; before he embarks on staid married life.  Raised  as the heir and inheriting the Dukedom at a young age, Paul feels the  weight of duty and has never done an improper or indecorous thing in his  entire life, except for this one harmless jaunt as he travels to his  betroth's house to formally ask for her hand.  Jo instantly trusts the  plain, kindly Mr. Villiers, who agrees to escort her to her aunt's house in  the morning.  Since no one at the inn knows who either of them are, he  figures that a young woman alone in an inn room for one night will not harm  her reputation...until Jo spies her FATHER lumbering up the stairs and  esconces herself in Paul's room to prevent being caught.  Trapped in the  same roomthat night, Paul wonders how his life suddenly got so  complicated...<br />For Jo's father has gone off in pursuit of his daugher to  her Aunt Winifred's.  But meanwhile, Jo's younger brother realizes that Jo  probably eloped with Mr. Porterhouse, who had suddenly disappeared the same  day Jo did.  Determined to set off after her to Gretna, his sister insists  on accompanying him but slows him down when she gets carriage  sickness...<br />Meanwhile, Jo realizes that Mr. Porterhouse, who had removed  himself from the inn after being so abused, had stolen her jewel case, with  her mother's and grandmother's jewels.  Raging mad, she determines to set  off after him, reluctantly escorted by Paul, who is beginning to wonder if  he is touched in the head.  But naturally, he cannot simply abandon the  girl to her wild chase...  Poor Paul!  So proper all his life, finding out  the truth of his very improper betrothed, yet digging himself deeper into  deception the longer he finds he cannot tear himself away from this  maddening woman...<br />Throw in Paul's friend Sir Thomas and a beefy groom  eager to pummel Mr. Porterhouse's face in, and you have a farce of  characters running around each other with quite funny results.  Mary Balogh  has proven she can write in all genres of fiction, from tragedy to  comedy.<br />Since I tend to like tragedies and dramas better than comedies, I  can't say I enjoyed this book to the full, but it is excellent writing and  consistent, solid characterization.  If you have a better sense of the  ridiculous, I am sure you will enjoy this book.	2000-06-08

Mrs. Gill has a cit of a husband with roving hands, especially when it comes to the young governess in hishouse, Abigail's friend. After telling off Mr. Gill, Mrs. Gill turns off Abigail with only a week to find another position.      Desperate, she screws  up her courage and goes to see the Earl of Severn, her very distantly  related cousin, for a letter of recommendation so that she can find another place of employment.  Determined to still her talkative tongue, blunt speech and managing ways, she succeeds so well that the Earl is convinced that she is the plain, quiet brown mouse she appears to be.      The Earl is besieged by managing females--namely his mother and sisters--who are descending upon him in a week in order to encourage him to formally betroth himself to another sweet, very beautiful, equally managing girl.      In a fit of pique he declares he'd rather marry a plain mouse who will NOT manage his life rather than submit to his persuasive mother.  Being faced with his impulsive wish in Abigail's visit, he also impulsively decides to marry her...and two days later finds his wife is not what she seemed.      He, however, has never laughed so much in all his thirty years of his life, and is amused and falling in love with his unconventional, warm and friendly and EXTREMELY talkative new wife.    But Abigail is beset by doubts an terrible fears.  She never seems to be able to get up the courage to tell him all about her past and scandalous family...until it comes back into her new life to rear its ugly head and destroy her new-found happiness...    This is a quick read and a delightful story.  Abigail is entirely endearing in her talkativeness and kind heart.  The Earl is the epitomy of a perfect husband--kind, patient, amused andwilling to admit when he is wrong, but still slightly confused on the ways of women.  Their story is satisfying and sweet.      Players in this book are also featured in other of Mary Balogh's books, namely one of the Earl of Severn's friends, who features in his own book, \\"A Precious Jewel.\\"	2000-06-01

Patricia accidentally overhears the venomous words of her sister and mother, discovering that she may be adopted and that the confusing coolness she has felt from them stems  from this.  With her father gone on an overseas business trip, she has no  one to turn to, and runs away from their spiteful, hateful words and  behavior.      Determined to hide until her father can return to help her, she  finds herself alone in the city, only to have God miraculously provide a job and a new identity as a companion to an old woman who turns into her closest friend.      Travelling with her employer to a far-off resort, Patricia  suddenly comes across a man she knew and loved one summer long ago, but she must pretend she doesn't know him in order to protect her identity.      But her young man has a tryst of his own, as he fulfills his promise to his mother to try to once again earnestly seek the God he has forsaken, while balancing the demands of his rich, selfish uncle, who wants to use him for his own ends.      A complex, thoughtful book...  An especially good story for  those who may have grown up in the church but turned away because of the influence of college professors or the secular world, who want to earnestly understand the God they once knew...and to know Him again, just as He has always known you, yet not forsaken you.	2000-05-12

Typically an anthology only holds a story or two that stands out, but this book differs: one, that there are actually 6 stories rather than only 4, and second, all 6 stories are entertaining.       Dorothea Donley's \\"Taste of London\\" is a fairy tale of two  cousins spending the season with distant cousin Lord Aldford and his  friend, who help Miss Amberly resolve the scandal of her family's past, with help from the Prince Regent.      Jean R. Ewing's \\"Notorious Lord\\" sends a Viscount in his friend Mr. Grenville's place to woo an \\"antidote\\" of a prospective bride, except that the bride has also  switched places with her friend Miss Fraser to avoid the expected Mr. Grenville. But the clever Miss Fraser has already recognized Viscount Beaumarais!      In Paula Tanner Girard's \\"A Matter of Honor\\", a wild Irish princess is forced to marry a duke according to an ancient agreement between the Irish lords and the duke's ancestors.  But the language barrier and a little trickery wed the duke to the girl before he can tell her about his betrothed and carts her to London!      In Jenna Jones' \\"Duke of Diamonds\\", a duke intends to humiliate a house of scheming, marriage-minded women...then too late discovers the one innocent in the pack of cats.      In Meg-Lynn Roberts' \\"For All Eternity\\", Christina Granford had seemed to love Viscount Fulbrooke those years ago during the  season, but had broken his heart when telling him she was already  betrothed. Now a widow, they've been forced to stop avoiding each other...       In Marcy Stewart's \\"Lady Constance Wins\\", Constance's three  adorable older cousins meddle and convince an American to pose as  competition to a man informally promised to Constance...but stalling in asking her for a formal pledge.     This is a great anthology to curl up with in a warm bed on a rainy day.	2000-04-22
