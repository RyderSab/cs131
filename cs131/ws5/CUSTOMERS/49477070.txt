She and her husband Todd had just returned from a European vacation the day before, and Todd was leaving early that morning to travel on business.  She heard him leave before she and her boys, David, age 3, and Drew, age 19 months, got out of bed.  Several months into her third pregnancy and tired from her long flight the day before, Lisa stayed in bed until her toddlers awoke, then she arose and began her day.  Later, a friend called her and informed her of the events at the World Trade Center.  Lisa turned on the t.v., and stayed riveted to it the rest of the day, watching the report of the crash of Flight 93 with horror.  At this point, Lisa switches gears and begins several chapters in which she chronicles Todd's family history, his growing up years, and college life.  She then spends the next few chapters giving the same information about herself.  Lisa's simple, straightforward style speaks for itself.  It struck me that both Todd and Lisa were raised in Christian, churchgoing homes, and that both of them were brought up to love the Lord and to live a Christian life.  Both of them came to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ in their early years.  Neither of them had \\"lightening-bolt\\" salvation experiences, but knew early on of their assurance of salvation and the importance of living according to Christian principles.  Like many teenagers, Lisa went through a period in which she rebelled somewhat as she questioned the God who would take her father from their family when she was only 15.  Lisa finally came to realize that God sometimes allows bad things to happen as a part of his plan, and what we on earth are not always meant to understand that plan.  As Lisa matured in her Christian walk, she eventually accepted her father's death and claimed the verse that \\"All things work together for the good of those who love the Lord.\\" She knew that someday she would understand God's plan in taking her father from his family.  The next few chapters chronicle Lisa and Todd's meeting, courtship, and eventual marriage.  Lisa portrays Todd as a goal-oriented person who did not act on impulse.  Todd wanted them to have a long courtship and engagement so that they would be positive about their relationship.  Similarly, Todd carefully outlined his career goals, and his move to Oracle computer software sales was another step in his eventual plan to have his own business.  Also according to Todd's plan, he and Lisa had 2 children and moved into their dream home by the year 2000.  He made sure that the family was involved in a church home, and they were very active, teaching Bible studies, helping with the youth, and planning of helping with missions.  Not quite according to Todd's plan, Lisa's third pregnancy caught them by surprise, but they were extremely happy about the new baby due in January 2002.  A huge sports fan, Todd wanted to take the boys to watch some big league games. At one of these, Lisa was struck by the picture that Todd and the boys made as they walked into the stadium.  She snapped a photograph from behind of Todd leading the boys by the hand, having no way of knowing how famouse this picture would become.  On September 10, Todd played with the boys and helped Lisa with their baths and bedtime.  Often when he was trying to get the boys focused on a goal, Todd would say, \\"Let's roll!\\"  The boys knew to quit playing around and get serious when their dad said those words. At this point, Lisa returns to the events of Sept. 11.  She describes how family and church friends rallied round her and gave her support as the events unfolded.  She describes her heartbreak and despair when she realizes that Todd was on Flight 93 and there were no survivors.  In the following days, Lisa began to hear of the passengers of Flight 93 possibly trying to overtake the terrorists.  The FBI allowed a United Airlines operator to call Lisa and tell her of the last phone call that Todd made.  Lisa was reassured that Todd did not sit back passively during the hijacking and his last thoughts were of her and the boys. Lisa states that now she knows the answers to the questions that bothered her after her father's death.  It was part of God's plan.  God kne that Lisa would need experience on which to draw to help her own children as they deal with the same questions that she had.  Lisa truly wants everyone to know what a comfort the Christian faith is, and therein lies the main message of this story.	2005-01-07

US	49477070	ROGZGRFSWMZE6	0805427635	512374216	Sunday Clothes	Books	3	0	1	N	N	big buildup--disappointing ending	The description on the cover of Sunday Clothes intrigued me since I am a Methodist and was very curious about the plot of this book.  As I read Addie and Zeb's story, I found myself anxious to get to the end to see how and if everything worked out.  As an avid reader of Christian fiction, I am always wondering how the characters work out their spiritual problems.  The title of the book also interested me, but even that part of the book did not pan out in the end.  The characters do attend church every Sunday, but, other than that, I saw no meaning behind the title.  Although Sunday Clothes had some interesting plot twists and sub-plots, I was extremely disappointed that the spiritual conditions of the characters are never referred to.  In addition, the ending was a huge disappointment in that several of the plot lines were never tied up.  This could have been a great book with a little more work on the ending and on the &quot;Christian&quot; part of Christian fiction.	2004-06-04

Lydia Clark, thirty-four-year-old spinster school mistress, has resigned herself to finding fulfillment with her parents, job, and relationship with Jesus Christ.  Suddenly she seems to be the object of affection by two men, both of whom do not interest her at all.  Widowed Mr. Towly, old and unattractive, makes no bones about the fact that he needs a mother for his children and someone to take care of his home.  Harold Sanders, crude and uneducated, does everything he can think of to attract Lydia, and, in doing so, finds himself attracted to someone else.  When Lydia does finally begin to fall in love, it is with archeologist Jacob, who is desperately in love with novelist Miss Rawlins, and only wants Lydia to help him understand her books.  Meanwhile, love is also blossoming with other Gresham residents; Paul Treves has finally gotten over his broken heart from book 2, and finds himself attracted to Mrs. Somerville, mysterious newcomer in Gresham.  Widowed Mrs. Meeks finds herself attracted to a neighborly young man, only to realize that she can never marry him because he is an unbeliever.  Noelle Somerville, who is frantically trying to run from her past and restore her relationship to God at the same time, has made up her mind never to wed a vicar, but is nevertheless hopelessly attracted to one.  Love is even showing itself among the teenage set, as Laurel Phelps receives love poems from Ben Mayhew.  Once again, Blackwell has woven together many different stories of the residents of Gresham, uniting them all with the steadying advice and presence of Andrew and Julia Phelps and the unconditional love and free gift of grace from Jesus Christ.

Book two deals with the time period of their engagement.  Quite a lot happens in this few months:  both Laurel Phelps and Philip Hollis are now old enough to attend boarding school, a mysterious stranger and his young son come to Gresham, the prickly Mrs. Kingston finds herself being courted by none other than the Squire himself, and Mercy Sanders dreams of a way out of her impoverished and underappreciated lifestyle.

But as their relationship progresses, so do Elizabeth's doubts.  She really is not sure if she loves him as a betrothed wife should, and she seeks out the advice of her future stepmother.  While Elizabeth is still struggling with her questions about her future with Paul, an unexpected visitor comes to Gresham.  Will he be able to win Elizabeth's heart, and, more important, to convince the Vicar that he is worthy of her attention?  Will Philip ever be able to adjust to the cruel taunts and pranks played by the older boys at boarding school?  Will the mysterious Mr. Langford let down his guard to the good people of Gresham and be able to become a true father to young Thomas?  Does the Lord really have a husband in mind for Mercy?  Will Mrs. Kingston let the Squire break through her barriers and be able to love again?  Once again, Blackwell has portrayed a lively village full of romance, family values, and the assurance that God sees his flock through everything in The Courtship of the Vicar's Daughter.  This was a wonderful additon to the series, and I am looking forward to my next visit to Gresham.	2001-07-01

There is Julia, a widow whose penniless condition has forced her and her three children to move to a long-abandoned inn in order to eke out some type of living for themselves.  Fiona is her loyal maid with a mysterious past.  Mrs. Kingston is a difficult-to-please busy body who is Julia's first lodger in the inn, one whom she cannot afford to turn away.  Mr. Trumble is the kind storekeeper who talks constantly in malapropisms, and the Worthy sisters are the town gossips who know everything that goes on in Gresham--and then some.  Add to this mix an out-of-work actor suffering from bouts of depression, an unusual cook who just happens to be a midget,a handsome widowed vicar with two lovely daughters, and a mysterious ghost who inhabits the Larkspur Inn, and you have a perfectly delightful tale of the ups and downs of the wonderful inhabitants of Gresham.  In the tradition of Karon's Mitford series, Blackwell expertly weaves a tale from day-to-day living by people who exhibit a strong faith in God.  I can't wait to visit Gresham again!	2001-06-25

As she does so, she also becomes a witness to Celeste's governess and other members in the household.  This is a great story of faith getting a person through very difficult times.	2001-06-21

Deoborah, eldest daughter of Edward and Rachel, possesses a talent for opera singing, and her father arranges for her to go to London to study with a well-known diva.  While there, she will live with the elderly Burke family friend Helene Knight.  At the same time as Deborah is moving to Miss Knight's home, her ne'er-do-well nephew Gregory is making arrangements of his own.  Not wanting to spoil his social life, Gregory decides to fulfill his weekly visits to Aunt Helene by hiring an imposter.  Matthew Phelps, who desperately needs the income, takes the job, although his conscience bothers him constantly, especially as he begins to fall for Deborah.  At the same time, the servant boy Thomas, who also desperately needs income to provide for his ill mother, falls into the clutches of an evil man who insists that he steal from his employer in order to pay for his mother's hospitalization.  As Deborah's lessons progress, she realizes that she is to be used as a pawn for her tutor to have a cover for her adulterous affair, and she has to decide if she will put her career over her Christian values.  Like the other three books in the series, Blackwell successfully keeps several plotlines going at the same time to provide interesting, only occasionally predictable, reading.  I enjoyed this series immensely and recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading Christian romance and intrigue and seeing the power of the Lord at work.	2001-06-21

In this second book of the series, however, she is intercepted by Mr. Price, a detective who represents  someone in her old life who now wants vengeance for the wrongs that she did.  An unbeliever, he refuses to see that Corrine in reborn into a different person and continues with his plan to abduct her and deliver her to the man that she had wronged in the past.

They try to spend the rest of the week enjoying and appreciating each other before it's too late.  I recently heard Blackstock in a radio interview say that a novella can be read in one sittting, and you will certainly be able to do that with Seaside because you will want to know how it ends.  Although I like Blackstock's mystery/thrillers better than Seaside, I did find this book very thought-provoking and enjoyed reading it.	2001-06-21

As Diedre examines the picture of her father and a familiar-looking girl, she realizes that this must be sister who was to have died many years ago.  But then who wrote the letters?

Miraculously, he is released, only to eventually find out that Gen is promised to Simon.  He makes Simon promise never to tell Gen the truth, and resolves to lead his life without his beloved Gen.  Whitson's master storytelling skill is evident as she weaves the differing stories of Gen and Two Stars, as well as those of Miss Jane and the Major and the orphaned twins into one riveting novel.  This is a great read, a must for those who are fans of Whitson and historical fiction, as well as for those who like to read about the power of God in people's lives.	2001-06-16

It has a great basis for the plot: yuppie, materialistic, twentysomething Sarah (who's running from her past, incidentally) inherits five orphans from her deceased, yet estranged, older sister who just happens to be Amish.  Like many of Lewis's books, I gained greater understanding of the Amish life, but otherwise, the book was just too predictable.  The less-than-dramatic last-minute conversion of Sarah Cain was a bit &quot;sappy&quot; and tied up all the loose ends on the last page of the book just all too neatly.

She and her brothers know that life does not have to be this way.  When her father lucks up on an abandoned homestead in Wildrose, Lolly and her brothers hope that this will be the last move for them.  But in case her father decides to move once more, Lolly has her eye on a wealthy widower who can provide her with all of the comforts and security that Lolly has never known.   Meanwhile, Donal, through a series of unfortunate circumstances, also finds himself in Wildrose farming someone else's homestead under false pretenses.  The longer that he stays, the more Donal realizes that he wants to settle there and have his own place in the community of Wildrose.  Gradually, the Lord convicts both Donal and Lolly to be honest and that security does not have to come in the form of material things.  Lolly and Donal are perhaps representative of all of the citizens of Wildrose who have found both the Lord and a place to call home in the Canadian bush town of Wildrose.  This book is an excellent addition to the series!	2001-03-15

What do these crimes have in common?  At the end of November Veil, Roger Shepperd, Christian Canadian Mounty, was contemplating a move which he has made when April Operation opens.  However, his family has not yet joined him.  That is probably just as well since Roger is never home and doesn't get much sleep while trying to solve the afore-mentioned cases.  Roger's first big case in New Brunswick is one of the most baffling that he has ever had.  As usual, Linda Hall's complicated plot twists keep the reader (and Roger!) guessing until the very end.

Instead of rekindling an old romance, like she had hoped, he introduces her to his fiance'.  It takes Meredith and the Lord to make Shelly realize that her life can go on and that she can become fulfilled in her career and as a Christian.  Clouds is a wonderful Christian romance with a great surprise ending!	2001-02-19

She portrays Jade and Tanner as earnest, yet flawed, Christians whose one night of passion leads them down rocky roads that change the course of their lives.  Growing up on the &quot;wrong side of the tracks,&quot; Jade had a loose mother and drunken father and no spiritual upbringing whatsoever.  After her mother leaves them, Jade spends the rest of her sad childhood taking care of her alcolholic father and trying desperately to rise above her circumstances. In the meantime, her childhood playmate, Tanner Eastman, with a wealthy and cultured background, lives his life mostly as his parents expect him to, with one exception.  He becomes a born-again Christian, something his overbearing and domineering mother cannot understand.  When Jade and Tanner meet again as young adults, they realize how much they love each other and want to be together.  Tanner leads Jade to Christ, and they make a commitment to each other and to God to stay pure until the time that they can marry, when Tanner finishes his law degree and Jade her nursing degree.  But Christian young people have hormones, too, and a night of unbridled passion between the two of them changes things forever.  Kingsbury does an excellent job of portraying Christians as real people with human characteristics.  Without being &quot;preachy,&quot; Kingsbury shows how lives are affected in one single &quot;Moment of Weakness.&quot;	2001-02-19

In those few years, Jennifer experienced death of both parents, alienation from remaining family, cruelty from a stepmother, abandonment, and numerous other traumatic experiences, only one of which would scar most people for life.  The fact that Jennifer came through this awful childhood to become the young woman that she is and write this gripping memoir is amazing, to say the very least.  This tale was so very sad, depressing, grim, and even horrifying in places that it was hard to believe that it really happened.  Realizing that Jennifer really did go through all of these things in her lifetime made the book that much more grim and dismal to think about.  I admire Jennifer's writing style and her ability to survive.  Most children would not survive this horrible, horrid, humiliating childhood.	2001-02-12

Peart did put a family tree in the back of this book, as I have been asking, but it is very slender and not comprehensive at all.  However, when I finally quit reading to see if everything &quot;fit&quot; with the previous fourteen in the series, I really enjoyed the story.  The characters of Joy, Gayle, and Dr. Wallace were thoughtfully rendered, and the initial concept, Joy's mural, does become a sort of ministry for her.  Joy's journey to Montclair and her discovery of Rose's journal was riveting, and Gayle's acceptance of her slave ancestors was touching and thought-provoking.  If the book is read singly, you will find it a heart-warming and enjoyable story.  However, as a conclusion to such a wonderful series, I was left empty and disappointed that Montclair is now out of the family and that there are almost no Montrose/Cameron ancestors left.	2001-01-14

It is sort of a combination of Man from Atlantis and Lost in Space, and not done as well as either of those B-grade t.v. shows.  The premise of the book was far-fetched, and the characters were fairly steroetypical.  I got lost in the technical jargon during Arak's explanations to Suzanne (the glossary in the back of the book helped, but not all of the terms were there), and I don't like to read a fiction book with the aid of a dictionary.  The ending was very trite, not all that surprising, and disappointing in that the reader never really knows what happens to Suzanne.  I get the feeling that Cook was writing this one to sell as a made for t.v. movie and lost sight of the higher quality writing that he is capable of.  If you are a Cook fan like I am, read it so that you can say you've read it; otherwise, don't waste your time.	2001-01-04

The Chamber of Secrets picks up during Harry's summer vacation before entering his second year at Hogwarts.  He is miserable because he has not heard from his new friends all summer long, and he has had to leave the delightful wizardry school to endure a summer of emotional abuse from his aunt, uncle, and cousin.  When Harry finally gets communication from his Hogwarts buddies as well as a &quot;house elf,&quot; he learns that someone does not want him to return to Hogwarts in the fall!  That especially seems to be the case when the magical platform to board the Hogwarts train mysteriously closes, leaving Ron and Harry to find a way to get to Hogwarts on their own.  The magical adventures are just beginning, and Ron and Harry are off to a whole new year of wizardry and wonder at Hogwarts.  The battle of good vs. evil continues as Harry hunts for the mysterious Chamber of Secrets.  This is a great book of fun, fantasy, and fiction for young and old alike.	2001-01-03

My teenaged son recommended these books to me, and I finally started the series.  Harry Potter is a great hero for kids, the book has classic elements of good and evil, the setting of Hogwarts is a wonderfully imaginative place, and most of the adults provide good role models for Harry and his friends.  I have only read three of the series so far, and I have yet to see why many fundamentalist Christians (of which I am one) are so upset.  A child with a good, firm foundation is perfectly capable of reading Harry Potter and determining truth from fantasy.  It is always good for parents and children to talk about whatever a child is reading, and certainly any concerned parent can talk Harry Potter over with their child, making sure to distinguish between fact and fiction.  If I had an elementary-aged child, I would certainly allow and even encourage him to read these books.  The Harry Potter series is not a whole lot different from The Chronicles of Narnia (just without the Christian emphasis), and this book is a great one to make children turn of the t.v. and READ!  I enjoyed the book very much, and I only deducted one star because there were a few points in the book in which I became bored.  Of course, as an adult reading a children's book, I expected that I would get bored and was pleasantly surprised that I did not get that way much! This is great fantasy reading for children of all ages and adults who love a good afternoon of escapism!	2001-01-03

The Bronze Bow is everything a YA novel should be, and MORE!  Daniel is a confused young man entering into manhood in the troubling times of the Roman Empire.  He has been taught to hate Romans and to fight them whenever he can.  When a friend invites him to hear a young preacher that people are beginning to follow, Daniel is troubled and confused by the message of love your enemy that Jesus preaches.  Daniel also is burdened with a frail, dying grandmother and sister who is &quot;possessed by demons.&quot;  As the man of the family, he knows that he must leave his carefree life in the wilderness and return hom to care for them.  When Daniel meets Joel and Thacia, his life begins to change as his friendship with them grows.  The Bronze Bow makes the reader feel that he is a part of those times as it broadens the historical picture of the period.  The book presents a wider view of Biblical times and the Jewish people and customs.  Daniel's interaction with Joel and Thacia, his ill sister, the Roman soldiers, and even with the new preacher, Jesus, causes him to grow in ways that a young Jewish man of those times might actually have changed.  The Bronze Bow is great reading not only for students, but also for anyone who is interested in a broader perspective of this period in history.	2001-01-02

Issie has a problem:  she finds herself more and more drawn to the handsome pastor/fireman Nick Foster and she knows that she is not living the life that she should.  But in the midst of trying to sort out her feelings, a crisis occurs: Nick's church burns to the ground, killing someone trapped inside.  Further investigation reveals that the victim, a young black man, was dead before the fire started and that perhaps Nick's church was picked to burn because of its open door policy to people of all races.  More complication arises when Issie discovers the involvement of her own nephew in this skinhead-type group.  Issie has no time to sort out her feelings for Nick as she tries to rescue her nephew from the crowd he is with before another incident occurs, and Nick becomes so disheartened after the burning of his church that he considers leaving the ministry.  You will not want to put this one down as you see how the Lord leads Issie, Nick, and the other characters through their trials and troubles.  Trial by Fire is another great suspense story by Blackstock, and I am anxiously awaiting the next one! (Hope Issie and Nick will be husband and wife in it!)	2000-12-31

Nikki goes to France searching for her natural mother and stays in Europe to enter service in the WRENS.  Quite by accident, she meets a Scottish Montrose cousin, and events unfold that keep the two meeting each other at Garnet's English home at different times throughout the war.  Luc, who follows in his father's footsteps to become a fighter pilot, also finds love in Garnet's home, as have so many young people before him.  But before any of these young people can fulfill their happiness, the war must come to an end.  What will happen to Luc, who is reported missing in action, and to Nikki, who has been chosen to fulfill a dangerous assignment on the front in France?  Peart has again woven a story of young people searching for fulfillment of God's plan for their lives, and has successfully found a fitting way to remove the matriarch Garnet Cameron Montrose Devlin from the series.  Once again, my only criticism is that Peart needs to put a detailed family tree in each book, as the cousins, half-cousins, in-laws, and other members of the Camerson/Montrose families continue to grow and get more confusing in each book.	2000-12-31
US	49477070	R1DW2CA6RNQNW4	0395924952	313543011	Jubilee	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A classic forever	I first read Jubilee over twenty-five years ago when I was in high school.  The edition that I read had a photgraph of the real Vyry in it as well as one of the author.  A native Mississippian, I had no clue at that time that Margaret Walker was to become Dr. Margaret Walker Alexander, noted author and poet.  I watched her funeral on t.v. a couple of years ago and remembered the first time that I read Jubilee and how much I loved it and remembered the respect that Alexander commanded everywhere she went.  Recently I decided to re-read Jubilee, and I am so glad that I did.  Although I loved it back then, I love it even more now.  Some have called Jubilee the black person's answer to Gone with the Wind, and perhaps it is, but I contend that Jubilee is for all races and not just for students of black history.  Vyry is honest about her heritage, both sides, and tells of her life in slavery, focusing on both the good and the bad.  The Reconstruction years are perhaps the most frightening in the book; she no longer has the benevolent white master and the safety of the plantation and its routine life to rescue her.  Many people seem to forget that Emancipation was not the answer in and of itself; the free black had so many hardships to face when he was thrust into the world that he was little prepared for.  Innis and Vyry discover this fact as they move, in Vyry's words, from &quot;pillar to post&quot; trying to earn an honest living and enjoy their freedom.  Perhaps Jim, Vyry's son from her relationship with Randall Ware, has a point when he comments that freedom does them no good when all they do is work all the time and see little from their efforts.  Jubilee has a great conclusion that sees the Brown family finally settle in a place where they are accepted and tie up the loose ends left when Randall Ware reappears in their lives.  Jubilee is still the riveting historical novel that I read many years ago, a must-read for all Americans, no matter what their heritage, anda classic, yesterday, today, and forever.	2000-12-31

Kitty has a hard time forgetting the horrors she saw in the Great War and the love of her life whom she lost as a direct result of that War.  Her bitterness creates a deep chasm between her and twin sister Cara that lasts for many years.  In a cathartic measure, Kitty writes a book about the devastation of the Great War and meets a loving, caring book editor in the process.  Could this be her second chance at love?  Likewise, Evalee has lost her own great love and returns to Virginia widowed and penniless with a young daughter to raise.  As she builds a business from the ground up, Evalee meets two men who love her and want her to spend their lives with them, one for whom money is no object and one for whom a love of books and teaching children is his main objective.  Can one of these men be Evalee's second chance?  Finally, Bryanne goes to Italy at the expense of her grandmother Garnet to get over losing her first love in a fatal accident.  Will Bryanne, too, finally meet someone and get another chance at love?  This is a great entry in the Montclair series, and my only criticism is that Peart needs to put a family tree in each book to keep me straight on the rather complicated family relationships.	2000-12-31

Turner has captured the essence of the Deep South with all of its idiosyncrasies in her portrayal of The Church of the Open Door.  When Perry Warren flees a broken marriage and moves south to write an expose' of the typical fundamentalist Christian, he ends up living right next door to Eldeen Rafferty, a &quot;poster-child&quot; for the stereotypical Southern Christian.  Perry becomes friendly with Eldeen and her family so that he will have more fodder for his book.  He does not count on actually beginning to love these new friends dearly and enjoy attending church services with them.  At The Church of the Open Door, its occupants, from Brother Hawthorne, the pastor who steps out of the &quot;typical&quot; male role to help his wife and tells his parishoners to do the same, to Joe Leonard, the shy teenager who plays the tuba for church services, and everyone in between, accept Perry unconditionally, and each manages to teach Perry a lesson about Christianity.  As Perry goes through the painful process of analyzing his unusual upbringing and his failing marriage, he gradually begins to find healing and answers at The Church of the Open Door.  Without a lot of preaching and testimonials, The Suncatchers manages to present such a wonderful picture of the Christian life that everyone who reads it will want to live as Eldeen and her family do.  Even Perry finally realizes that this Christianity thing might have something for him as well.  As a woman of the Deep South who is a born-again Christian and holds a masters degree in English (some may see these things as paradoxical), I find Turner to be on the same level with Eudora Welty.  Turner captures the true spirit of the South in her charaterizations and descriptions; her Eldeen is portrayed with equal finesse of Welty's Phoenix Jackson, Sister, and Stella Rondo.  I feel as if I would know Derby, S.C. and The Church of the Open Door if I visited there much as I feel I would recognize The Worn Path and Sister's P.O.  The Suncatchers is undoubtedly the best book that I have ever read, and I hope that Turner will continue with her tales of Derby.	2000-10-04

After settling on their new homestead, Matt's father must return East to bring back his mother, sister, and newborn baby.  He leaves thirteen-year-old Matt to care for the place while he is gone, a journey that shoud take less then two months, but ends up being twice that long.  Matt has to tend the crops and the house as well as fend for himself when he runs out of supplies to make meals.  Along the way, he learns some valuable--and very hard--lessons, such as locking the cabin door carefully and taking care of his Pa's gun.  When his luck has almost run out, Matt meets Attean and his grandfather, Indians who befriend him.  Attean patiently teaches Matt the ways of the wilderness, and soon the cultural gap between them is bridged.  The Sign of the Beaver is an excellent lesson in not only history and pioneer life, but also in the effects of racism and prejudice.  This is a great YA novel and an excellent choice for readers of all ages.	2000-10-04

He needs warm clothes, a way to build a fire inside of his shelter, and meat for the winter.  The way that city boy Brian copes with these and other survival problems will captivate you and leave you admiring his resourcefulness.

Although I love Janette Oke, I've never been a big fan of her books written with Bunn until now.  The Meeting Place is a wonderful story of God's love overcoming cultural differences and prejudices.  As Englishwoman Catherine makes friends with the Frenchwoman Louisa, the French and Indian war looms around them, and Catherine's beloved husband Andrew is an officer of the King's Army.  Knowing that they are supposed to be mortal enemies does not affect the growing relationship between Catherine and Louisa until the Acadians are told that they must leave Acadia (now Nova Scotia).  After meeting Louisa and her husband and extended family, Andrew realizes that he cannot participate in the upcoming war, and risks his career and his family's well-being to take his unpopular stand.  In a plot twist that will keep you riveted, the two families are separated, but a slender thread remains between them that will keep you anxiously awaiting the sequel.  The Meeting Place is a wonderful story of God's love and faith that crosses all languages and nationalities.	2000-10-02

The  narrative is told mainly by her mother, with remembrances from her father,  brother, and various friends sprinkled throughout the story.  Cassie's own  words, via letters, essays, and journal entries, are also used effectively  in telling the story of her troubled teen years.  Surprisingly, Cassie did  not start her teenage years as a firm believer in Christ.  Instead, she was  going much more the way of life led by her eventual killers; she hung out  with the wrong crowd, talked of Satan and murder, and fought constantly  with her parents.  In addition to Cassie's story, this is the story of how  the Bernalls dealt with Cassie's rebellion.  After accidentally finding  notes between Cassie and a friend from the &quot;wrong&quot; crowd speaking  of Satanism, murder, and hurting oneself, the Bernalls took a firm stand  with their daughter.  They took away almost all of her privileges, they  transferred her to a small private Christian school, and they insisted that  she visit the youth group at West Bowles Community Church.  I read with  amazement that later changed to admiration of the lengths that the Bernalls  went to in order to save their daughter.  Cassie's mother quit her job in  order to be home more, and eventually the Bernalls sold the home that they  loved and moved to another one just to get Cassie into a new neighborhood.    Ironically, after allowing Cassie to go back to public school, they  transferred her to Columbine to get her away from the &quot;wrong&quot;  crowd and into a &quot;safe&quot; environment.  Misty Bernall tells of  Cassie's rebirth in Jesus Christ but also realistically tells how Cassie's  spiritual journey was not always an easy one.  The reader will appreciate  the frankness with which she tells of mother-daughter conflicts and how  some of her last memories of Cassie were nagging her toget her homework  done.  Cassie's story is inspiring, and readers will like the honesty with  which Misty tells the story and does not set Cassie on a pedastal as a  perfect daughter.  However, more inspiring to me was the story of the brave  stand that the Bernalls took to get Cassie away from the wrong influences;  paradoxically, these same types of  influences eventually took Cassie's  life.	2000-08-28
US	49477070	R1X5RR7J06NYJZ	0689806981	32099706	Tears of a Tiger	Books	4	143	156	N	N	even realism can too far	As a junior high school English teacher, I am always on the lookout for a good YA novel to teach to my students or to recommend that they read  individually.  When I heard of Tears of a Tiger, I had high hopes that it  would be everything that I look for in a YA novel.  First of all, I liked  the fact that the main characters were African-American.  I teach a large  portion of African-American students, and I have a lot of trouble finding a  YA novel in which African-Americans are the central characters (are you  listening, YA authors?).  Second, I absolutely loved the differing points  of view style that the book is written in.  The way that the characters are  developed through conversation, letters, poems, essays, and so on is one of  the best that I have read.  This is a great teaching tool alone, not to  mention a super way of telling the story. Third, the event that is the  catalyst for the plot, the underage drinking and driving, is realistic and  teaches a great lesson to teenagers. Given my glowing praise, you may  wonder, why not five stars?  The simple fact is that Andy's suicide  destroyed the book for me.  The whole plot of the book seemed to be leading  to Andy's coming to grips with the death of his friend.  I was thinking:   what a great way to show kids that there are other alternatives than  killing oneself to work through problems.  Then, the suicide note and he is  dead.  This is not a good message to send to youth.  While a mature young  adult can read and understand this book the way that the author probably  meant it to be read, this is not a YA book for the masses.  In good  conscience, I cannot teach a book to kids who have enough disturbing  messages thrown at them from all sources on a daily basis as it is.  They  do not need to read a book in which the main character, a young man much  like many of them, cannot cope with his mistakes and kills himself.  Would  I still teach Antigone and Macbeth, you may wonder?   Yes, I would; the  characters who commit suicide in many classic works of literature bear  little or no resemblance to the teenagers of today.  Andy, on the other  hand, is too much like many of the teenagers that I run into on a daily  basis.  Our children need to be taught the real truth--that suicide is a  permanent solution to a temporary problem.	2000-08-28

Jason Faircloth, pious and upstanding minister of a 2000-member  church, learns that even ministers are not perfect and do not have all of  the answers all of the time.  Honestly believing that he is doing the right  thing, Jason raises his daughter Hannah in a strict, straight-laced manner.   She cannot wear pants or makeup, listen to popular music, date boys, and  dozens of other &quot;don'ts.&quot;  Because he turns a deaf ear to her  pleas to be understood, she leaves home, seeking the freedom to make her  own choices.  Eighteen months later, Jason and his wife hear that their  daughter has died, leaving behind a baby girl and an inconsolable husband.   However, the son-in-law wishes no contact with them, knowing of Jason only  through Hannah's description of her strict, legalistic background.  Later  losing his wife as well, Jason, now devastated and doubting his own faith  in God, goes on a journey hunting for his grandaughter. The eighteen-year  journey that leads him through several states as well as Norway, England,  and Cyprus mirrors Jason's spiritual journey as well.  A chance encounter  at a church in Norway begins to restore Jason's faith in God as he realizes  that the strict legalism of his past faith is not a replacement for a  personal relationship with the living Jesus Christ.  Jason's quest for both  spiritual answers as well as his only remaining relative will keep you  turning page after page.  Arhtur's book is worth reading again and again.	2000-08-27

Devastated after her husband leaves her, Rachel McCain turns to  the only one that she thinks she can depend on for support--her church.   Instead of finding the strength and unconditional love that she needs, she  finds a long list of &quot;do's&quot; and &quot;don'ts&quot; that she now  has to live by.  Rachel slowly begins to realize that the strict,  legalistic church does not offer the emotional stabilty that she craves,  and she begins to search for anwers elsewhere.  As in Jordan's Crossing,  Rev. Jason Faircloth plays an important part in Rachel's renewal of her  spirit and her faith in God and the church.  Betrayal is an excellent novel  and will keep you reading whether or not you have ever questioned the  &quot;rules&quot; that go along with Christianity.  I think that each of  Arthur's books is better than his last, and I am anxiously awaiting his  next one.	2000-08-27

But  the experiment backfires when the criminals use their now-enhanced mental  powers to escape and begin a gradual take over of certain areas of life,  including politics and law enforcement.  Ten years later, one of the  original recipients of a chip dies in a freak car accident in Jackson,  Mississippi, and a pathologist inadvertantly removes the chip during the  autopsy.  Not wanting their diabolical plan to be discovered, the  &quot;chippees&quot; (to borrow a term used above) will do anything to  recover the chip, including murder.  Dr. Spence Stevens, distraught over  losing his friend and mentor, is convinced that something suspicious is  behind the murder, and asks his old friend Joey to look into it.  Joey, an  emotionally disturbed military man now turned private detective, begins to  unravel a plan so intricate and cleverly-disguised that he bumps into dead  ends every time he thinks that he has a new clue.  Finally he asks his  friend FBI agent Bob Kennedy for help.  After Joey loses his life in an  &quot;accident,&quot; Spence and Kennedy realize that whoever wants them  out of the picture is playing for keeps.  The twists and turns in the plot  will keep you spellbound, and as the plot develops, more and more people  become involved until you never know whom to trust.  Should Spence trust  the beautiful newspaper reporter Christen, his loyal assistant Flo, or even  FBI agent Bob?  You won't know who is a good &quot;chippee&quot; and who is  a bad &quot;chippee&quot; until the very end!  Charles Wilson is a master  of the complicated plot and Game Plan is one of his best scientific  thrillers yet.	2000-08-13

In Prairie Fire, Palmer  shows an entirely different side of the citizens of Hope than she did in  Prairie Rose. When Caitrin Murphy falls for Jack Cornwall, her sister,  brother-in-law, and the other citizens of Hope do not approve because of  his Cornish heritage, traditional enemies of the Irish immigrants of Hope.   When Caitrin tries to point out the irony of Hope residents who accept  German and Swedish immigrants but not Cornish, her brother-in-law Jimmy  O'Toole won't listen.  He tells her not to forget her Irish heritage and  her allegiance to it.  Caitrin replies that she is now an American and  &quot;won't be bound by petty prejudice.&quot;  Jimmy refuses to listen,  even when Jack gives his life to the Lord and changes his previous ways.   When Jack's mother and sister arrive in Hope, the townspeople become even  more suspicious.  How can a family keep one of its members in chains?  The  townspeople resolve to force the Cornwalls to leave. The drama builds to an  exciting climax at an emotional prayer meeting of dedicated Christians that  ends up in a scene not unlike a bar room brawl.  Can these so-called  Christian citizens ever accept those who are different?  I found Prairie  Fire an enjoyable novel, one that teaches as great a lesson to Christians  today as to those of the town of Hope over 100 years ago.	2000-08-09

Oriel Banning is a paid companion to spoiled American debutante Neecy McPhail.  As they travel shipboard to England to meet Neecy's fiance, Oriel  has a fateful encounter with tycoon Morgan Drummond, also on his way to  meet his fiance.  Once they arrive in England, Oriel suddenly finds that  her services are no longer needed as soon as Neecy's wedding is over.   Alone with no family, friends, or money, Oriel starts trying to find work  so that she can afford to return to America.  Again encountering Drummond,  he proposes a plan that will be of mutual benefit to both of them.   Financially unable to turn down his offer, Oriel accepts his plan, which  includes a year-long stay at his ancestral castle in Ireland.  Once there,  it becomes extremely obvious that someone is trying to frighten and maybe  even kill Oriel.  Is it the unfriendly housekeeper Mrs. Nesbit?  Or perhaps  her maid Molly, who loves to indulge in the village gossip?  It could even  be the ghost of Shaleen O'Connor itself, coming back to haunt the castle  and rid it of its present occupants.  As Oriel struggles with the  frightening reality that someone does not want her around, Morgan becomes  more and more distant and unfriendly.  Even Oriel's new friends, the  Wicklows and poet Bryan Moore, no longer seem as friendly as they were.   Although Oriel realizes that someone is trying to scare her away, she knows  that she must stay in Ireland because she has made a perilous bargain.

Meg has always lived in the shadow of her beautiful, more outgoing sister  Marlys.  As she watches Marlys toy with the emotions of homesteader Royce  Ferguson, she realizes that Marlys actually has no intention of marrying  him and moving to the wilderness of Wildrose.  Meg, who knows that she will  be happy even among the hard life and simplicity of Wildrose, eventually  comes up with a plan to mend Royce's broken heart and to get out from under  her sister's shadow.  Meanwhile, back in Wildrose, &quot;old maid&quot;  Miss P struggles with the fact that she is alone and has no family.

The Montrose children, who have been split up since the untimely death of their  mother on the Titanic, finally reunite at the home of their grandmother in  Virginia.  The youngest, Bryanne, who has not seen her father, grandmother,  sister, or brother in the ten years since her mother's death, is deeply  disappointed that her father and brother are not interested in forming a  stronger relationship, and she is very hurt when her wayward artist father  leaves once again.  Only her relationship with older sister Lynette is  renewed and becomes stronger than ever.  Both sisters experience their  first loves, Lynette with an up-and-coming senatorial candidate, and  Bryanne, with the handsome Irish groom.  Their cousin-uncle Scott Cameron,  editor of the local newspaper, decides to endorse Lynette's fiance Frank,  not knowing that his old friend, war-hero Kip Montrose, has also decided to  throw his hat into the race.  Kip's aggressive campaign is suddenly halted,  however, by the sudden and near-fatal illness of his son Luc.  In the  meantime, Jillian, Bryanne's English companion, finds herself drawn to  Scott, and Crystal, a New York photographer, is hopelessly attracted to  Kip.  Kip, however, is torn once again between Scott's sisters, twins Kitty  and Cara, both now attractive widows with a new maturity and wisdom that  comes from the trials that they have experienced.  On top of the varying  love interests in this book, the underlying tension between the Montrose  children's grandmothers, Garnet and Blythe, which has been a part of the  last several books, finally comes to the surface in Senator's Bride. The  Brides of Montclair is a great series, and my only complaint about these  books is that Peart should have put a comprehensive family tree in each one  so that I can keep these rather complicated Montrose/Cameron relationships  straight, especially when a good bit of time elapses before I read the next  installment.  Senator's Bride was a great Christian romance; I recommend it  and the entire series to anyone who likes this type of book.	2000-07-26

Like Gold Refined, the conclusion to the Prairie Legacy series, continues the story  of the Davis's grandaughter Virginia.  In the first three books of the  series, readers saw Virginia mature from a flighty teenager to a caring  young wife and mother.  In Like Gold Refined, Virginia's path to maturity  continues as she has to accept the physical changes in her aging  grandparents, Clark and Marty Davis.  She does not want them to grow old,  to leave their farm, or to change anything in their lives.  Her mother  Belinda has accepted these changes and makes plans to deal with them, but  Virginia wants to hang on to the past, keeping everything the same.  When  Virginia and her husband Jonathon have to suddenly deal with a court battle  over their &quot;unofficially adopted&quot; daughter Mindy, Clark and  Marty's problems take a back seat to their own setbacks.  Over the ensuing  months, Virginia and Jonathon travel to the city, leaving their young  family, battle with judges and lawyers, and risk losing their livelihood as  they go in to debt to pay legal fees.  All the while, Virginia tries to  maintain a normal household and keep things the same.  Finally, it is Mindy  who realizes that changes must be made and she makes the decision herself  about where to live.  After it is all over, Virginia explains to Mindy that  some things are meant to change, and that it is all in God's plan.  Through  her own journey with Mindy and their problems, Virginia finally realizes  and accepts that her grandparents are aging and must leave the farm.  If  not for the trials that Virginia suffered with Mindy, she would not have  come to grips with the fact that even her grandparents' lives must change.   Oke has done an excellent job with the two storylines, using one to bring  about the resolution of the other.  She has also come up with a fittingconclusion to the story of Clark and Marty, and has indeed shown the  complete transformation of Virginia from a contented, yet carefree,  housewife to a sensible young mother whose trials have formed her into a  wise Christian woman, much Like Gold Refined.	2000-07-25

Once his acclaim for killing the first meg was over, he and his father-in-law's company were hit with  lawsuit after lawsuit from bereaved families of those eaten by Meg 1.   Bankrupt and being held accountable at the trial for all of those deaths  combined with the loss of his and Terry's unborn baby has made Jonas a  broken man, haunted with nightmares of not only those deaths, but also with  premonitions of his own death at a similar fate.  His all-consuming goal is  to prevent anything like that from ever happening again, and, to that end,  tries to warn Sea World authorities that Meg 2 (now called Angel) has the  capability to break through the gates to her lagoon and should be stopped.   Naturally, they wait too late and Angel escapes, eating three delinquent  teenagers for lunch on her way out of captivity.  As Angel heads for the  open sea, evil Benedict Singer is heading for the trench with Jonas's wife  Terry as his captive.  His plans to mine manganese from the floor of the  trench are brought up short by the presence of yet another prehistoric  creature that has managed to survive the Ice Age, the kronosaur.  The  interwoven plots involving the above sea-level chase of Angel and the deep  undersea chase of Benedict will keep you reading.  The Trench was a real  page-turner, with the characters getting in (and out) of predicament after  predicament, including meg attacks, kronosaur attacks, attempted rape,  murder, and blackmail, to name a few.  The Trench built up to an exciting  climax with Jonas trying to save Terry, much like the premonition of his  nightmare in which they both die.  Once you start reading The Trench, you  will not want to put it down.  Like Meg, some of the The Trench is a little  farfetched, and also like Meg, the ending is left open to another book of  this type.  However, I think that Alten has done well with these twobooks  and a Meg 3 would just be too much of a good thing.  Need I remind you of  Jaws 3 and 4?  The Trench is a good book for fans of this type of novel,  but not as believable as Meg or as Charles Wilson's Extinct.	2000-07-23

Jonas Taylor spends the better part of his career trying to convince the public that prehistoric megalodons could survive in the warm waters of undersea canyons.  When a submersible dive goes awry, he spends the next 7 years in psychotherapy and trying to convince himself that he only imagined seeing a megalodon.  But when a friend shows him a picture of what could be a megalodon tooth lodged in the old wreckage of the submersible, Jonas decides to make the dive again.  What he discovers on the dive leaves him paradoxically excited that he can finally prove that he is right yet upset that he loses another friend and inadvertantly brings the female to the surface.  Everyone, including the media and the U.S. Navy, gets into the act once the megalodon surfaces.  The ensuing chase and capture of the megalodon is exciting and will keep you reading, constantly wanting to know who will win out, man or beast.  Like any good shark book, Meg is filled with &quot;good guys&quot; and &quot;bad guys&quot;, and I can't deny that I felt a certain satisfaction when the meg snacked on the cheating wife.  I only wished that the lover and news reporter had met the same fate.  Of course, I also never understood why Benchley's great white never got to munch on the mayor of Amity!  Unlike many of the reviewers below, I remember that this is science fiction, and what does it matter how big the tooth is, how long the meg is, or how many millions of years ago it lived?  It IS fiction, after all.  I found the explanation of how megs could survive in the Mariana Trench and how one of them could swim to the top bathed in the warm blood of the dead meg plausible.  However, even I had trouble with two points: the meg is able to leap out of the water almost its entire body length (straight up, too--to attack a helicopter) and Jonas (Jonas, not Jonah) pilots the submersible inside the shark and kills it from the inside (maybe all action heroes should conveniently carry eight-inch meg teeth around with them).  Yes, I remember that the great white in Jaws 2 also jumped out of the water to attack a helicopter, and I had trouble with that 25 years ago, too.  I don't think that Meg will keep readers out of the water like Jaws did (the real shark attacks on the Gulf Coast of Alabama are doing that), but it will give you something to think about.  Overall, this was a great read, the excitement building and building until the dramatic climax.  Like many of the reviewers below, I will read the sequel and I think Meg would probably make an exciting movie.If you are a fan of shark books, you will like Meg, but then read Extinct; it is better.	2000-07-18

What does it matter if there are some similarities?  It is a totally different story  and a great book.  I find Extinct within the realm of believability (i.e.,  Loch Ness monster--no one is sure that it is not a plesiosaur).  Great  science fiction takes a scientific plausability that few people think about  and turns it into a great story.  That is exactly what Charles Wilson has  done with Extinct; this was the first book that I ever read by Wilson, and  it is still my favorite.  The plot is eventful, the characters are  likeable, and the climax is astounding.  Recently I learned that NBC has  indefinitely suspended the mini series due to cost.  Why not let Speilberg  have a crack at it?  This fantastic book is just begging to be put on  screen.  Who wouldn't like to see a mechanical megalodon added to Universal  studios?  Extinct is a page-turner, and Charles Wilson is a wonderful  science fiction writer.	2000-07-08

Embryo was a  suspenseful, fast-paced medical thriller that kept me on the edge of my  seat.  The technology used to grow embryos outside the womb was explained  in layman's terms so that I pretty much understood it.  And like great  science fiction, it seems to follow real-life scientific developments  (i.e., Dolly the sheep).  What a scary thought that events in this book  really could parallel real life!  Charles Wilson always gives me something  to think about.  In addition, toward the end of the book, just when I  thought I had it figured out, the plot took a totally unexpected turn.   That shows a truly great suspense writer.  I agree with reader from Newport  News that Wilson can easily join the ranks of Robin Cook and Michael  Crichton.	2000-07-08

Well,  one scientist intends to find out.  I thought the book started out a little  slow, but once the woman became pregnant with the &quot;prehistoric&quot;  baby, events really started to happen.  As a matter of fact, things  happened to quickly that I did not want to quit reading until the end.  I  had a little trouble with the gross part (cannibalism), but not enough to  make me put the book down.  By the time that started, I was all wrapped up  in it and wanted to know what happened next.  The details were not gory  enough to make me deduct a star, but weak-stomached readers need to be  prepared for it.  The climax of the book was a complete surprise, and I  think that Charles Wilson is a top writer of this genre of book.	2000-07-08

Taking her little brother and her few now-freed slaves with her,  they embark on a perilous journey where danger and adventure await them on  every corner.  A devout Christian, Jesselyn finds that her faith gradually  slips away as they encounter pitfall after pitfall.  By the end of the  book, she has quit praying altogether and is blaming God for the war.   Meanwhile, her sisters in Richmond find love and happiness with soldiers  that they meet and reunite with their long-lost brother, now wounded from  battle.  Unlike Jesselyn, they retain their faith in God, even when  Louisa's soldier is declared missing and probably dead.  This book was good  and kept me reading, and I want to read the second one because so many  loose ends were left.  Will Jesselyn ever get all of them to safety?  Will  she ever give her heart back to God?  Will Louisa's true love return?  Will  Twin Oaks still remain when they get back home?  Anyone who enjoys  historical Christian fiction will like this book.	2000-07-08

Cara and Kitty, the twin daughters of the Camerons, are anxious to find love and  find it in unexpected places.  The Montrose children, Kip and Merry, also  find the love and happiness.  Will willful, impulsive Cara settle on the  quiet, sober ministerial student or the boisterous, playful Kip?  Will  Kitty, the quiet soft-spoken opposite of her identical twin, ever tell who  is her heart's desire?  Will Merry carry on a clandestine romance, knowing  that the object of her affection would meet with her doting mother's stern  disapproval?  Finally, will Kip ever decide which twin it is that he loves?   In addition to the romance ups and downs of the four young people, all is  not well with the older Camerons and Montroses as heartbreak awaits them  after the maiden voyage of the Titanic.

In this book,the reader pieces together the story  of the Biddles as different parts of it are told from the points of view of  the main characters, Catherine, Dottie, Della Boyd, and Barb.  Each  character brings their own unique perspective to each event in the book.   The Biddle family, run (but not very well) by the immaculate Catherine, is  much in need of some unity, and during one eventful year, they find that as  they come into contact with the main characters in the book. A family in  need of change, the Biddles are finally able to do this with the help of  those arond them.

In ostensibly telling the story of Birdie, however, Margaret,  the narrator, actually ends up telling the story of her own troubled life  also full of suffering.  The example shown by Birdie is not only an example  for Margaret, but also for anyone who reads this book.  Margaret's dark and  troubled past has made her into a brusque, no-nonsense woman who shows no  emotion to anyone, even her husband.  When Birdie comes along and  inadvertantly becomes Margaret's friend, that shell begins to crack.   Through Birdie's friendship, Margaret learns that the God that she had  rejected long ago still does love her and want her in His kingdom.  Some  Wildflower in my Heart is a wonderful story of friendship and the love of  Christ breaking down the barriers to someone's heart.	2000-06-25

Her  estranged family of aunts, uncles, and cousins all seem to be keeping  secrets from her, as do the retarded man and his crazy mother who live next  door.  On top of this, Margaret also comes across a one-hundred-year-old  legend that includes a curse on her house and a ghost who walks the beach  at night.

As Jordan's Crossing opens, it is immediately evident that Jordan is a man who  is disturbed and in conflict about many issues dealing with Christianity.   After his son is brutally and senselessly murdered, Jordan goes through a  change in his attitude and personality that no one, his wife, daughter, or  his church members can understand.  No one, ministers and psychologists  alike, can get Jordan to open up and begin the healing process.  Instead,  Jordan goes through his own process, or crossing, as he single-mindedly  pursues his son's killers.  Yes, how he achieves this crossing is riveting,  sensational, and even hard to believe, but it works for Jordan's  personality and the way that he handles his grief.  The reader is kept on  the edge of his seat not only to see if Jordan ever gets his man, but also  to see if he ever makes his crossing.  This is a riveting and  thought-provoking book.	2000-06-17

Rosie faces each challenge with a  smile and with the knowledge that God is her father and his love in her  heart.  The humor in this book is expertly balanced with the hard praire  life that Rosie comes to love.  In the midst of her hardships, Rosie comes  to understand the true meaning of not only God's love for her, but her love  for Seth.

The author spent a great deal of time developing Abbie and Monte's mutual attraction to each other and not enough  time developing their characters.  After Monte marries someone else because  of his honor's pledge, the book suddenly gets eventful.  The last fourth of  the book contains all the plot development and excitement, including a  murder, a kidnapping, a surprising rescue, encounters with Comanches, a  scarlet fever epidemic, and a gold strike.  I had originally planned to  give the book three stars, but added one just because of the last part of  this book.  Overall, however, I've read much better Christian historical  romances, and I hope that the next in this series will improve on plot and  develop the characters more fully.	2000-06-11

Sharon  also plans to solve a probable murder (which her aunt had vaguely referred  to--was she serious or making it up?) that is more than fifty years old  while she is there. Take these elements, add old friends whose religous  views make Sharon uncomfortable, a family scandal long since covered up,  a  haunted house, a &quot;crazy&quot; housekeeper, and a prodigal daughter,  and  you have a great novel!  I recommend this book for any mystery fan,  secular or Christian, and for anyone who has ever felt constrained by  &quot;rules&quot; of the Christian faith.	2000-06-08

Secrets of the Heart was such a big disappointment, however.  Although the basic plot is imaginative  and the characters are endearing, the entire book was lacking in several  ways.  First, the authors took half the book just to give the background to  the major storylines: Kathleen being reunited with her daughter and Tom and  Kathleen finding happiness together.  The background leading up to  Kathleen's problems was just too involved and detailed, so much so that the  first part of the story detracted from the rest of it.  Second, the  &quot;meat&quot; of the story was sketchy and left a lot of gaps.  Perhaps  if the authors had not spent so much time developing the background that  this part of the story would be better.  Also, Kathleen and Tom's  characters were not as well-rounded as they could have been.  Tom  especially is not a particularly interesting character.  It was hard for me  to empathize with him when I knew virtually nothing about him.  Finally,  the ending just sews up all to neatly.  Even though I was glad of the way  it ended, a lot of gaps in the story and &quot;fast forwarding&quot;  occurred before I got there.  On the plus side, the lesson that Kathleen  learns about forgiveness and God's love is the major strength of this book.   Secrets of the Heart should probably best be categorized as young adult  fiction, but even teenagers would have trouble with parts of this book.	2000-06-04

Showers is Season is a story of journeys--Barry's journey into  acceptance of a handicapped child; Sylvia's journey into discovering God's  plan for her; Cathy's journey into learning how to be a single mom.   Showing that life isn't always easy, even for Christians, is what  Blackstock and LaHaye do so well.  Throughout the ups and downs of life,  this group of friends and neighbors continue to rely on God and their  strong faith to get them through everything.

Unlike the earlier two books in the series, the reader knows right away &quot;whodunnit.&quot;  However, this knowledge does not spoil the outcome  at all; on the contrary, the twists and turns that the plot takes as the  culprit is pursued keep you on the edge of your seat.  As always,  Blackstock's plots also involve a spiritual awakening for at least one of  the main characters, and the revival of attorney Jill Clark is a major  plotline of Word of Honor.  How she copes with an unusual client who has  some very black-and-white religious beliefs ties in with Jill's gradual  renewal and deeper understanding of her own Christian faith.  Word of Honor  is Terri at her best, and I can hardly wait for the next in the series.	2000-05-29

The romance part of When Dreams Cross was not very creative and it was easy for  me to figure out that Justin and Andi would eventually find each other in  the end.  However, what made this book great was the suspense and mystery  throughout the story and the apparent sabotage of Promised Land.  This  thread of trying to figure out &quot;whodunnit&quot; kept me reading until  the outcome and was the first inkling that I got that Blackstock is a much  stronger suspense writer than she is romance writer.  Apparently, she now  realizes that too, because her later two series bring her skill of mystery  writing to the forefront and put the romance angle as pleasant secondary  plotlines.  When Dreams Cross was a great mystery and only a fair romance  (which is why I deducted one star), but worth reading by any Blackstock  fan, any Christian who has ever questioned God's plan for the future, or  anyone who has ever failed at romance and gun-shy to try again.	2000-05-29

In Melissa's case, REVENGE.  Blackstock does a great job of showing that Christians are human and have to deal with the problems of life like anyone  else.  The difference is how a Christian, like Detective Larry Millsaps,  deals with those problems.  Not only is the story great, but also having a  great Christian law enforcement officer as the protagonist was  wonderful--not a lot of writers could carry that off the way that  Blackstock can.  The only thing lacking in this story is that it has not  yet been made a movie of the week!	2000-05-29

The strength of Drucilla's faith sees her through the difficulties of being  married to someone who does not return her love and marrying someone that  her family does not approve of.  The story of Drucilla, a cousin to the  Montroses in the first few books in the series, provides a necessary  connection in the rest of the Brides of Montclair series as the turning  point of Montclair going back to the Montrose family occurs in this book.   As she leans on God, Drucilla eventually finds peace and the love she  desires; Destiny's Bride is a great addition to this series.	2000-05-25

I was totally caught up in the physical and spiritual journey of Soaring Eagle.  His struggle to admit his connection to not only white  people, but also to Christians, was enthralling.  To add even more drama,  Whitson has Soaring Eagle interact with Lisbeth's husband in a secondary  plotline that will keep you spellbound. Normally I am not an emotional  person, and I was actually sobbing out loud by the time that I read the  last word of Soaring Eagle.  I am a prolific reader of Christian fiction,  and Whitson far outclasses her more well-known counterpart Lori Wick.  The  Prairie Winds and Keepsake Legacies series are likewise far above anything  that I have read by Oke, Wick, Glover, or Peart (and I have read them all).   My only complaint is that Whitson is not writing them fast enough!	2000-05-25

This is undoubtedly one of the best books that I have ever read.  The unique &quot;counterpoint&quot; genre similar to Rivers' The Scarlet Thread adds that much more intrigue to the  story.  This was a book that I did not want to put down.	2000-05-23
