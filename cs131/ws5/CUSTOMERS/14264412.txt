This book is a good addition to the \\"JKD library\\". It contains some interesting defensive concepts and street-fighting applications not contained in the same way in the other, so-called \\"better\\" JKD books. I recommend it. I have several books on JKD, because I am a JKD student and really concentrate on this art. This book is not as comprehensive as, say, the books by Chris Kent, but this is the book that I used at the beginning, when I was first learning JKD, and I think that this book is the best book I have seen at presenting the basics/intro. of JKD (the Kent book is better overall, but there is so much in them, that it is just overwhelming because he presents so much at once, whereas the Lamar Davis book gives you a very solid introduction, and I didn't find it overwhelming).	2005-10-13

Of course, the reality was that those highly government-steered economies faced 10 years of downturn and recession from 1992, while the U.S. boomed. Now we have this new book which states basically the same thing, even though if you look at the list of the most competitive countries, you see the ones without a strong industrial policy at the top (Finland, USA, Holland, Switzerland, New Zealand, Britain, etc.). Japan, far from being a booming economy, has been stuck in stagnation for over 10 years. Germany has become more efficient in spite of, not because of its government. Does the author really believe that the German state makes the German economy more competitive ?? One key point in this book is the idea that state-steered Airbus is beating Boeing, because it has more orders (the book as written in January, 2005). Yet, I was just in Germany this past week (October 2005), and read an article in the German press on how Boeing has more orders, and is overtaking Airbus. So does this now make the author's claims that the Europeans are beating the U.S. in this \\"key industry\\" meaningless ? I would suggest, it does. In addition, that same article discussed the cultural conflicts at Airbus (French vs. German managers, etc.). That seems hardly an competitive advantage vis-a-vis Boeing. The truth is that the U.S. got competitive in the 1990s because: a. Wallmart spurred massive savings by its innovations and cost-cutting, which spread throughout the U.S. economy, b. dot.coms located around the private university Stanford thrived, c. the Reagan Revolution had cut government involvement in industry, and freed up the economy. In contrast, Europe has been held down by the German and French interventionist states (the truth is, Europe IS strong, as this book suggests, but it would be much more successful if the state cut costs, taxes, and bureaucracy). The same is true of Japan and China. Mao and the communists prevented the \\"Chinese boom\\" in the period 1945-1980. It has only been deregulation and allowing capitalism in that has freed up the Chinese economy. It was not \\"state planning\\". This book is basically a rehash of books like Robert Reich's \\"The Work of Nations\\" from the early 1990s, which argued that nations compete against each other. Reich's book was largely refuted, and I think this book can be too. The truth is, Germany is not competing with the U.S. and Japan. We have individual companies, funded by international shareholders and funds, operating across the world. The idea of \\"national industries\\" is just a dead idea. In science, the U.S. continues to lead the world. I live in Dallas, Texas, and many of the top German and French researchers live in this highly unregulated Texas, even though they could be living and working in the \\"state-steered\\" scientific environments of Paris and Munich. There is a reason for that. Indeed the author of this book mentions the 400,000 European technology workers and scientists working in the U.S. My question is, if the \\"environment\\" in Europe is so great, why are they here ? Nobel prizes were awarded last week, and there was a two to one ratio of Americans to Europeans. Thus, our \\"scientific environment\\" is not so bad in the U.S. I found this book interesting as a thought-provoker, but in reality, I think that most of the theses in the book have been refuted (the exception would be the U.S. dollar, which will fall, as the author states, and the fact that yes, the current U.S. boom is largely funded by individual U.S. consumers going into debt, so it is \\"debt-funded growth\\"). But I still think that when we here buy a Lexus, and send dollars to Japan, we get the better deal, because it adds more to my life to drive a nice Lexus around, than it adds to the Japanese lifestyle, to have T-notes in a bank vault in Tokyo. The idea that only exports count, not imports, is a neo-mercantilist idea. If exports over imports equal wealth, why aren't the mineral-exporting African countries rich ? Why are countries like Singapore and Switzerland, which do banking and services, rich ? The author also seems to think that only manufacturing counts, not services. The \\"Economist\\" magazine criticized that idea, saying, just because you can \\"drop the product on your foot\\" doesn't mean it is a good product. The truth is, manufacturing is not important for a country, and \\"key industries\\" also aren't. What counts is productivity. If you have productivity and can sell something that someone will pay for, you can be wealthy. Also, the author doesn't mention that the U.S. economy is 80 % internal. It is an \\"inner market\\", so only 20 % of our economy is subject to export-import. Of course, for countries like Japan and Germany, exporting is critical to survival. For the U.S., much less so. That is one reason Americans don't care that much if the dollar falls, whereas the Germans treat the rise and fall of the euro as absolutely life-threatening.	2005-10-08

The main point of the book is also that there is no \\"magic bullet\\", what works for one person might not work for all, and you might have to try differnt things, or try again after it fails the first time. If you look at how people stopped smoking, there are many paths to the goal, so not everyone will take the same path. But certain commonalities emerge (for example: countering, which means, you say to yourself things like \\"I can relax without a cigarette\\"). This book is thus not some author's personal view on what he or she thinks works, it is an after-the-fact look at what actually did work, for thousands.	2005-09-27

As Steven Malanga critiques in his book \\"The New New Left\\", Ehrenreich sets out to prove the thesis that you can't \\"make it\\" in America in an unskilled, entry-level job. However, as Malanga shows, Ehrenreich sets the experiment up to fail, and she doesn't stay on at any job long enough to gain any of the social support factors or promotions that might make the job sustainable. Hence, she goes into the experiment, with a view to forcing it to fail, so that she gets the results she wants. For example, people might start out at a low-end job, but then move up, develop social ties, get a second job, and end up far better than she portrays, because she refuses to do any of that. If entry-level jobs in the U.S. are so terrible, why do millions of people all over the world want to have those jobs ?	2005-09-09

Very true. Increasingly, the Left is dominated by what Steven Malanga calls \\"tax eaters\\", which are mostly public unions in large U.S. cities that exist to consume tax funds (and provide \\"services\\" to client groups, but in a very inefficient way that does not solve the underlying problem). It is interesting to note that as the U.S. moves more to the \\"Right\\" (free market economics, individual responsibility and low taxes), the big cities are dominated by groups perpetualy stuck in the 1960s Welfare State (tax heavily to fund a huge public bureaucracy that ostensibly redistributes money to victim groups and minorities). The latter is, as the late 20th century shows, increasingly inefficient and decrepit. Go to any big city and see the inner city stagnating, and the periphery growing and thriving (that is really the case where I live, which is Dallas, Texas). Public unions increasingly use the rhetoric of \\"helping the poor\\", when in reality, they are just out to defend their own power. This is very clear, for example, when Walmart attempts to move into a ghetto. Mostly, the people living there are for Walmart, becuase to them it means shopping cheaper, and thus, an increase in their disposible income. Then, inevitably, \\"activists\\" show up (mostly from outside the community that they perportedly speak for), claiming to \\"speak for the community\\". Those groups mainly object to Walmart because Walmart is non-union, not because Walmart \\"oppresses the poor\\". Thus, the special interest groups involved want to defend their own power, above all else. This is especially true of the teachers' unions in big cities. The sheer cynicism coupled with the hypocrisy is so startling (\\"activist\\" organizations demanding that companies pay their workers \\"a living wage\\", but then not paying their own workers the minimum wage !). Thebook provides short, readable chapters on Walmart, Barbara Ehrenreich (who \\"job slums\\" at low end jobs all to \\"prove\\" her tendentious point that the poor get the shaft in America). I highly recommend this book for a real look at the dynamics of how big city politics works today, and why our big cities are so dysfunctional.	2005-09-07

As a martial artist who has done many martial arts, I have to say, this information really rings true. For example, he states, the goal of self-defense should be to \\"stun and run\\" - which almost anyone who knows the field will tell you. For example, where I train, we \\"stay and commit\\", but most of us are pretty highly trained. I have also done some of the \\"military martial arts\\" that Tom describes, and to be honest, in a \\"bad\\" situtation that I can't talk my way out of, i count on it to save my life, and I have been trained to \\"fight through the adrenaline dump\\" by the Israelis I trained with. But I also realize, most people don't have time to do that kind of training. So Tom's program is really useable for people who don't want to become experts in the martial arts. His book is full of lots of information that can literally save your life (for instance, have a map before you visit a new city, etc.). The book is full of anecdotes of personal protection. I particularly liked his advice on using your eyes to scan a room, and how to confront a \\"bad guy\\" who is sizing you up (you basically stare through him to let him know you are not afraid). A lot of his advice comes down to projecting confidence and not being a \\"victim\\", becuase universally, bad guys go after people whose body language, eyes, and positure suggest that they are not willing to defend themselves. So this is an excellent book on personal protection that I would highly recommend to anyone, from the beginning to the true pro.	2005-08-31

The problem is, whenever you question the \\"party line\\" in the U.S. that mass, uncontrolled immigration is the only way, you are often labeled a \\"racist\\" or \\"nativist\\". This book is not anti-Mexican, it is pro-sustainability. The book is actually compassionate. Hanson states that many of the students he teaches are Mexican, and he likes Mexicans. But the point is not, do we like Mexicans, the point is, when does a society or a state reach the point at which immigration is no longer sustainable (to use a term that liberals love). Hanson's point is that that point is already reached. All you have to do is see the overpopulation of California. The 17 % of U.S. prisoners who are illegal immigrants. The ambulance services forced to go bankrupt in Arizona, because federal law mandates that they treat illegals, but federal law does not require the govnment to pay for it (!) [by the way, I am for such treatment, because it is the only humane way, but we also have to remember that someone pays for it]. Spiralling crime in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California. State after state - including Democrat-run states like New Mexico and Virginia, declaring states of emergency because of the chaos of mass, uncontrolled immigration. Even Hillary Clinton and other liberals are now admitting, enough is enough. In the city where I live (Dallas), our schools now mostly teach illegals, and there are signs outside the schools in Spanish stating, \\"Become a U.S. citizen \\" (!). Crime is way up in Dallas, as it is throughout the southwest. Texas builds more and more highways and more and more housing to try to cope with the population explosion. The state is now a \\"majority-non-white\\" state, like California. Texas never solved the issue of dire poverty, and yet, we are now taking on masses of very poor people, all in the name of dubious \\"diversity\\" (when is there enough \\"diversity\\" ?), and cheap labor, so that we canget our cars washed and our hedges trimmed, dirt cheap. Sure, immigration has its positive side (an infusion of young people, with their energy, people willing to work hard, etc.), but the general trend has been negative, with social and environmental standards eroding over time, and Hanson does a good job of portraying that.	2005-08-30

Guys, we don't know you, so unless you provide us real concrete examples, your critique is just empty, and sounds kind of ridiculous. The whole thing is \\"he bad\\" kind of stuff. What is this, high school ? Antonio is from New York, and he makes no bones about his experiences being a \\"cultural clash\\" (between his New York way, and the Asian way). This type of book has a long tradition, in the line of Mark Twain's \\"Innocents Abroad\\". Sure, you could start ripping on Twain, saying, \\"he really didn't understand the Europeans\\". But that is not the point. The point is a personal portrayal of personal experiences, and I don't really think Graceffo went into it with an axe to grind. He is just observing. I don't understand why the \\"critics\\" are acting like this is an article in National Geographic or something. It isn't. It isn't supposed to sooth anyone's ego or cultural sensitivities, either (by the way, do you really think all foreigners who write about the U.S. go at it with \\"kid gloves\\", or do some of them not tell what they think, from a personal perspective ?). Bottom line: politically correct books are boring. I have read too many \\"China is a land of opportunity and rich culture\\" kind of stuff. I found it refreshing that someone over there told it like it was. I am sick of westerners kissing Chinese keester, just to \\"get in good\\" with people in the People's Republic. Even worse are some westerners who go to North Korea and don't report \\"reality\\". I think authors have a duty to open their eyes and tell us what they really think, rather than writing some boring politically-correct book that glosses over the real issues. As for the Shaolin Temple, I mean, as a martial artist myself, I think it is totally ok to question it (as Bruce Lee stated, just because something is very old doesn't mean it is automatically good). I mean, why shouldn't we that be allowed ? I actually consider this book to be a great book about the REAL China. One of the best books I ever read about the REAL China was a book called \\"Losing the New China\\". Great, great book about what the P.R.C. is really like, from the inside. Did that author piss a lot of people off ? You bet he did. Was it a great book ? Yes ! I consider \\"Losing the New China\\" and Graceffo's book to be indispensible on understanding what the real China is like.	2005-08-26

It is fascinating. The story of an American living in Chicago, who gets tired of the corporate rat race, and takes the very bold and risky step of joining the French Foreign legion. The book describes the training (brutal) and all the cliques of nationalities (Russians, Poles, etc.) that form. The fistfights that ensue. This is a fun book to read, and provides an interesting insight into human behavior and the military. The author clearly has an ambiguous relationship with the Legion from the very beginning (for example, he writes: \\"The military strategy of the French Foreign Legion seems to be to march somewhere, build a fort, and then wait for everyone to be killed\\". He describes the July 14th military parade down the Champes d'Elisee as \\"fascistic\\". The book is brutally honest, and I admire the author's courage and risk-taking, as well as his honesty. It is interesting to me because I also was 24 in Chicago, in a suit, and left it to go to Europe for 8 years (albeit to sudy German and then work for a German company). I also am now in the oil and gas sector and live in Texas. So I could identify with the author's \\"journey\\" and motivation a lot. He just did something that the vast majority of us are too \\"sober\\" or too timid to do. This is a fun book, and a book that on almost every page, I was saying out loud, \\"Jesus\\", or laughing. The only thing I would change in the next edition is, do better copy editing. An error on the title page is really not acceptable. But a really good book.	2005-08-08

The Economist editors who wrote it got beyond the cliches about Bush and the Republicans and really did some homework here in writing this excellent book. Their critical eye and sense of humor is on display on every page. As British writers, they are also less hung up in all the emotion, as an American might be. I particularly liked the analysis of why the Democrats are so weak. The book basically says that the U.S. will tend to now produce more \\"conservative\\" politics, because unlike Europe, Americans: a. like business and business people, b. like the military, and c. like individual rights (over collectivist rights). Even a Democrat president like Clinton had to slide to the right (welfare reform, putting more police on the streets, cutting back on government growth, etc.). The book also highlights how the GOP (Republican party) needs to win: to not anger the \\"Religious Right\\" in the South, but also to not be \\"religiously intolerant\\" and alienate Republicans (like me) in the West and Midwest and North. In other words, the future of the party is Bush, but also Schwarzenegger and McCain and Giuliani. Leftwing policies are basically a way to lose big elections, as Al Gore found out in 2000.	2005-06-23

I got this book, and I would say it is very good. It is the only book out there that details basic krav maga techniques, and for that, I think we should thank the author. I was a bit surprised to hear the Israeli guy say it is not real military krav maga, because I trained several times here in the U.S. with Israeli Seals and paratroopers and I see no real difference between their system and what David teaches (plus, the krav maga I learned is the exact program designed in Israel by Imi for the IDF). Yes, there is a lot of \\"politics\\" in martial arts (!), and yes, it is very \\"par for the course\\". The author states that he travelled to Israel to learn krav maga, so I also found it odd that someone would say he doesn't know the \\"Israeli version of krav maga\\". I found this book to be a really solid intro. to krav maga. It is just, there is nothing like the intensity of a krav maga class. If you have been in a class, the intensity is just so real and important, and you can't get that from a book. I recall doing like 30 seconds of hard knees into a pad someone was holding, with 3 krav guys yelling at me to \\"stay in the fight\\". I recall being in a darkened room, with people with pads pushing in on me, with my eyes closed, and someone yells \\"gun !!\\", and you have to fight your way out past the people and find the gun guy and defeat him. I recall the adrenaline, the stress, the sweat. You of course can't get all those \\"military\\" things in a book, but you can at least see the krav maga program. I think this book is a good introduction to krav maga.	2005-06-14

In other words, it is possible to be a \\"good christian\\" in a bad state (ask the Poles who lived under communism), and it is possible to be a very bad Christian under a purely good so-called \\"Christian State\\". In fact, some argue that the more the state tries to be secular and distance itself from religion, the more religious the people get. It is almost like, if the state is a so-called \\"religious state\\", people think, \\"well, they are taking care of that, I don't need to\\". Look at modern Iran, the young people want to be secular westerners. Thus, we westerners should celebrate our secular GREEK-ROMAN-BRITISH-ENLIGHTENMENT heritage, as a source of strength, not a source of weakness ! <br /> <br />Does anyone recall the Latin American holocaust, in which the deeply Christian Spaniards slaughtered the Indians in Latin America in the 1600s ?? All done \\"under God\\".  <br /> <br />Does anyone who positively reviews the book understand Europe's history ?	2005-06-07

Let's face it, for all the \\"demonization\\" that occurs regarding alcohol, the medical community is increasingly admitting the positive health benefits of drinking (it reduces dangerous blood clots and thins the blood, thus preventing heart attacks and heart disease).      But I think it is funny how the medical community in the U.S. states that the maximum you should drink a day is two drinks if you are a man, and 1 if you are a woman. At the same time, the same medical community admits that alcohol has tremendous heart benefits, but that those heart benefits only kick in \\"at two drinks, minimum\\". So, according to the medical community, the minimum for health effects is two, which is - shazam ! - simultaneously the maximum you can allow yourself. Pardon me if That results in me not really believing them, and I think the author does a good job at highlighting the way they play with the statistics and data and conclusions.     My only caveat to this book is that I have done a lot of reading on milkthistle and other herbs that supposedly \\"protect the liver\\". From what I have read, for instance, such things as milkthistle are, at best, only moderately supported by evidence as to their \\"liver detox\\", or \\"liver-protecting\\" qualities. The studies that show that milkthistle protects the liver, are mostly very old, European studies that are not designed well. Also, stuff like licorice and artichoke is, as far as I have read, unproven in its liver-promoting qualities. (note: I have read one doctor who is a liver specialist say that dandelion, far from protecting the liver, can perhaps even hurt the liver !). [note that recent studies have shown one substance to really be protective of the liver, and that is coffee. There is now a lot of hard science that shows clearly that drinking 2+ cups of coffee a day protects the liver from cihrosis and liver cancer, and the more you drink [up to 4 cups], the more it protects !!].       Other than that caveat, I think that the idea of drinking water and taking vitamins are good ideas, and the book is full of a lot of good ideas. Also, the author has a lot of other good ideas about having \\"drink-free days\\", and treating the liver like a muscle in the sense that when you \\"overwork it\\", you have to \\"give it a rest\\". I think most doctors who are liver specialists would support that idea. My advice is read this book, but don't also try to pick up a book written by a doctor who is a liver specialist.	2005-06-07

This book really shows you that these guys are young \\"kids\\" who are really normal people, like you and me. Look at the photos of them. They look like anybody. Most are not \\"huge\\" by today's [steroid] standards. In fact, the book makes the point that they do it the \\"natural\\" way, with no creatine, no steroids (creatine can get you killed in SEAL training, as it can on the football field). I wish all young American men red this book at 16 or 17, to understand that you can do miraculous things with your body, without chemical \\"help\\". The intro. details a SEAL wartime operation in Grenada in 1983, in which the young SEALs are afraid for their lives. The real fear of war came through to me, not the \\"gung ho\\" movie stuff. I also thought that at age 39, I am \\"too old\\" to be at their level. But there have been SEALs as old as 39 who went through BUD/s ! This taught me that it is a cop-out to say \\"I am too old to train hard\\". What I am trying to say is, this book is very real, and shows these guys are just \\"normal guys\\", but they do incredible things. I found it really uplifting, oddly, because of what it depicts. But the human mind is so strong, if it is focused. Thank God we have young men like this in our country, too.	2005-05-31

The book seems to imply that walking a certain distance is the same as jogging it, in terms of calories burned and fitness. Yet, if you read the Mayo Clinic guide to fitness, they say that jogging is three times better in terms of burning calories. So which is it ? I doubt if I walked 4 miles that I would see the same benefit as if I jogged it. Still, I recommend this book, because the basic concept is solid.	2005-05-27

The characters I found to be very real and authentic, and the dialog and pacing is great. The technical details are well researched. I highly recommend this novel. It also provides real background on what is going on in Saudi Arabia (the author discusses the dwindling wealth per person in the kindgom, and the extravagent lifestyle of the 35,000 princes who run the kindgom, which is increasingly unpopular). CIA sources have already predicted scenarios of this type occurring in the near future. Very solid novel.	2005-05-24

As we see in Lebanon, Iraq, etc., there is a broad spectrum of Muslims, and to lump them all together the way the author does is not what I would expect from a CIA analyst with all that experience.

It flew by, mainly because it is fun to read. It basically shows how a reactive president with little character, who couldn't keep his zipper zipped and merely reacted to everything (while hiding from his maniacal wife) took credit for an economy the foundation of which was set by Reagan years before. Clinton was more interested in making sure that his core constituency (single moms, ethnic groups, and feminists) were happy, and not nearly enough time on real national security. The result of all this was September 11. Clinton's legacy: yes, the stock market boom, but also: Somalia, not capturing Bin Ladin, politically-correct law enforcement (rather than real security and real law enforcement), and mass, uncontrolled immigration. I hope we don't have another sociopathic president and \\"first lady\\" like that ever again. One thing liberals forget: the \\"Christian Right\\" only started to rise after our president stooped to such moral and ethical lows as the Monica Lewinsky scandal.	2005-05-18

The fact you know this guy was a SEAL means that all his insights are hard-won and REAL (whereas, with other authors, they are just claims). It would be like someone writing a book about mountain climbing from his living room, never having climbed, and someone who climbed Mt. Everest writing the same type book. Whose insights would you be more likely to believe ? The truth is, Janke's insights are deeper because they are hard-won. I also found it interesting to think about how the SEALs solve problems (the path of most resistence, etc.). I sometimes think of life as hard, and then think of one of the insights of this book, and problems SHRINK.	2005-05-18

Che's office had a window where he could look out on the firing squads shooting men in the head with .45 handguns. One after another after another. Che once said, \\"we don't need evidence\\", and \\"we have to become cold-blooded killers\\".  <br />- Fidel hated Che and sent him abroad on \\"missions\\" to get rid of him.  <br />- Cuba's prisons contain 80 % black prisoners. The communist party is 0.08 % black. Thus, Cuba is a racist country (a U.S. \\"black panther\\" who hijacked a plane to Cuba in the 1970s and was ended up in Cuban prison, was brutally maltreated and lost the use of one eye as a result once said, \\"I would rather be a prisoner in the U.S. than \\"free\\" in Cuba).  <br /> <br />- Fidel was involved in murder across borders (i.e., terrorism).  <br />- Fidel pleaded with the USSR during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 to fire nukes at the U.S.  <br />- Despite receiving billions in aid from the USSR over 4 decades, today, the average Cuban gets less rations per day than the slaves in Cuba in 1840 !! <br />- Hollywood and the Left turn a blind eye to Cuba's human rights abuses, praising the dictator, Fidel. (whereas Chile's Pinochet - who the Left love to revile, had 5,000 people killed, Fidel and Co. had 15,000 people murdered, all without a fair trial, many with no trial at all). <br /> <br />I wish all the leftwingers in the U.S. and everywhere would read this book before talking about how Fidel is such a great \\"Third World leader\\", or putting on that Che Guavara t-shirt.	2005-04-27

I agree with the people who say this book might get you hurt. The techniques to me look too dangerous. There is one picture that shows a gun being pulled, and the next picture, the defender has the gun (voila !!). No picture intermediate to that explains HOW the defender got the bad guy's gun. I find this book actually kind of funny. If you really want effective self defense, sign up for krav maga in your area. Brazilian jujitsu is a SPORT martial art, not a street martial art. Do you want to take a rabbit rifle to a bear hunt ? Me either. Also, no real knife attacker will make it so easy that you can do the defenses in this book. He already has your \\"defenses\\" thought through, and how he will answer them. Real knife fighers do feints and don't let you see the knife, or they will draw you one way and slash back.

Michael Moore is a child with crayons compared to the Gibson. At least Gibson author did real research, and draws conclusions that an educated adult might draw. I also think it is funny that most critical reviews don't get to the heart of the book - the view of the U.S. abroad, in the period 2001-2003. The critiques of this book don't talk about the theme of the book, they 'rip' on America, which further underscores the author's main theme (!). The negative reviews are basically further slanderings of the U.S., which just reinforces what the author is saying.  <br /> <br />Most critics talk about how \\"undemocratic\\" the U.S. is, and how \\"rednecks\\" read this book (and I thought liberals hated \\"profiling\\" and were for \\"tolerance\\" and diversity. Guess not).  <br /> <br />I am an American who lived abroad (Germany) for 8 years, and I can tell you, most of the things the author states are true. I call anti-American sentiment \\"Microsoft Syndrome\\", because the psychological mechanism is the same: it is human nature to hate the successful guy, or the person or entity who is \\"on top\\". That is the reason so many people \\"hate\\" [read: envy] the U.S. That is why so many Americans \\"hate\\" the New York Yankees: they are successful and are not modest about it. The same holds true for why people hate America: they hate us because we are number 1. And please don't believe that the French, Muslims, Germans, Chinese, and Brits \\"loved\\" us under Jimmy Carter or Clinton either. They just hated us less, or in a different way. The true \\"hatred\\" came on when they saw that Bush was not going to pretend that France and the Palestinians were \\"partners in peace\\" and all the dross that Clinton spewed to appease other nations. Bush tells it like it is, and they hate him deeply for it.	2005-04-06

The more you dislike France as a political entity, the more you will like this book. Having been in France many times while living for 8 years in Europe, I can state, this book hits it on the head. The author is very funny, and has a very good way of putting things. France as a political entity is basically 'sociopathic'(egotistical and unethical) and hypocritical, the author states (and thus France, not the U.S., is the true \\"rouge nation\\"). Someone once said, France is like a 55-year old woman, with too much makeup on, trying to cover up the fact that she is no longer in her prime. So true... On the way to becoming a \\"Euro-Islamic Republic\\", French thought, policy, and actions revolve around trying to tear down a society much more powerful and important and dynamic than itself: the U.S.A. As my French barber in Europe told me again and again, \\"it is all about envy, nothing more\\".   <br /> <br />Boyle, like me, likes the French, and hates their ruling elite.

It follows his childhood, which was filled with self-doubt and fear, to his training in martial arts, to his work as a bouncer in a medium-sized British city. Some of the stuff is really amazing (Geoff fighting basically an entire bar full of guys). Amazingly, he won almost all his fights with k.o. punches. How he did that is beyond me, and he must have broken his hand numerous times. He states he was in literally over 100 real fights. I think this book would be great for all bouncers to read. However, within a U.S. context, k.o.-ing your opponent is not adviseable, from a legal point of view. Geoff seems to think that blocking or choking someone out wouldn't work, or takedowns, etc. He thinks that the only way to win is to hit the guy in the head. Which is fine, I mean, he \\"been there, done that\\". However, as I said, I would not recommend that for U.S. bouncers. Also, he encountered very few weapons, which I also doubt would be the case, when U.S. bouncers are shot at and knives are often involved. I mean, did these bouncers never hear of O.C. spray ? It really is an amazing book, and I could not put it down, it is also interesting how Geoff got into the job so much that it endangered his marriage. Great book, but as I said, I prefer O.C., jujitsu, and takedowns.	2005-03-11

I would really like to take this opportunity to answer the critics. First of all, there have been a lot of reviews of this book that basically say \\"how can we know that Marc has real street experience\\". Well, true. But how do we know anyone has real street experience ? Like, um, how do we know that Geoff Thompson is not a computer IT consultant who wrote his bouncer bio while riding the train to and from work - i.e. making it up ? the truth is, we don't. But, I have to say, from reading a LOT of what Marc MacYoung has written, it has never crossed my mind that he is not for real. In fact, he makes a big deal about saying how the \\"street\\" sucks. Also, the gangs that shot at him were probably Mexican gangs in the 1970s or 1980s, not today's gangs. also, regarding knife fighting, he states very clearly that he spent his \\"knife fighting career\\" either running away, or retreating. I doubt that if Marc had made it all up, he would state that. It just sounds too realistic to me. Also, see his website [...] That also looks real. I also doubt that Peyton Quinn would associate with Marc, if Marc were a \\"wannabe\\". Unless Quinn is too, which I also seriously doubt.  <br /> <br />Yes, Marc's book is highly silat/kali/wing chun based, but so what ? those are great arts. I do silat, and it is by far one of the most street-effective arts out there. I like the fact that this book is principle-based. for example: take the centerline seems like really good advice to me. Also, many, many people (and I do JKD, so I know), will say, \\"whoever hits first wins\\", but Marc makes the point that he has seen guys hit first and then get thrown across a pool table by a guy who could \\"eat the punch\\". How often do even the best boxers get a k.o. with ONE PUNCH ? I doubt even Ali or Tyson in his prime could win a street fight that way. One main point in this book is takedowns are a MUCH more effective way to win a real fight than beating someone with your fists, or [worse yet] with kicks. The reason is, many people can \\"eat\\" incoming punches if they really want to get to you. However, noone can battle gravity if you throw them down. AND, the floor is very hard. I know this because I have done takedowns on the street, and I can tell you, they DO work. The thing Marc says about protecting the bad guy's head in order not to go to jail also totally rings true, and was totally also my experience, in that I once put an old aggressive drunk down, and had to protect HIS head in that way, to avoid really hurting him.  <br /> <br />Anyway, the real hype to my are some of the critiques of Marc. he is the real deal, as far as I can tell. This is a great Martial arts, self defense book.	2005-03-11
