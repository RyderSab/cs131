The author writes in a style popular at the turn of the century. Unfortunately, the century was 1800s. Dry, overly complicated, and filled with word selections such as \\"whilest\\" and \\"Effortful\\"; using those terms and language as the Alexander himself did, in the early 1900's. It is one thing to honor the originator, it is another to make the text convoluted and unreadable in an attempt to be \\"faithful\\" to the technique.<br /><br />As a \\"how to\\" book, this one fails miserably. The best that can be said for it is that it is a mediocre \\"how not to\\" book; the author spends much more time telling you the wrong way things are done rather than the correct way to do them. The photos in the text that show the wrong way, far outnumber the photos showing the correct way to do things. Photos showing proper technique are poor at best.<br /><br />As an example, the author elected to use a photo of a toddler walking as an example of good posture. Since no toddlers are reading this book and they are substantially physiologically different from adults, I doubt that was the best example to give. Showing an adult in a good example of the technique would have been much better and more illiminating. In the few photos where adults are used to demonstrate the correct posture, the effect is somewhat unattractive.<br /><br />While I have no doubt the concept behind \\"The Alexander Technique\\" is a good one, and it has many health benefits, the actual technique and the teaching of it can only be described as overly complicated. Designed to confuse the reader into thinking there is more to it than there really is. Some of the things promoted in the text such as: \\"Experts\\" in the technique,<br /><br />\\"Qualified Teachers\\", \\"slow step by step process that you could never hope to achieve on your own...\\". are just there to try and shroud the technique in a false mystery. Marketing plain and simple.<br /><br />If the author elected to use language designed to clearly educate, illuminate and instruct, this book might have been a worthwhile addition. He didn't and therefore, it isn't.<br /><br />Let me save you the cost, and the time required to wade through this gobbledie gook.<br /><br />1. Keep you head balenced on top of your spine<br /><br />2. Relax your neck to help direct and condition the balence of the head.<br /><br />3. Stand up straight without forcing yourself into the position.<br /><br />4. When you can stand and sit straight, comfortably, with your entire body in a relaxed state, you've got it nailed.<br /><br />That's it. Now go look for a book to buy with more to offer.e author elected to use language designed to clearly educate, illuminate and instruct, this book might have been a worthwhile addition.

US	52982479	R351HUS2SYOFMA	1570231990	4583376	Dressing Smart for Men: 101 Mistakes You Can't Afford to Make...and How to Avoid Them (Career Savvy S)	Books	2	15	15	N	Y	Still wading through, but it doesn't  look good!	I initially gave this book the above 2 stars when I was still thinking I would finish reading it. I believed that there might be something good to be found here if I pressed on. Was I wrong. Needs a much lower rating that 1 star but can't give it or change it. The subtitle reads \\"101 mistakes you can't afford to make...\\" If it were about writing, the author breaks all 101 and then looks for some more to trample on.     The chief premise of Ms. Nicholson, is that your coloration plays the important roll in what will look good on you. OK. Sounds valid enough. However, when the author gives example of skin tone by \\"name dropping\\" famous people (10-15 per type) as having such and such a color type, we have just crossed the line to ludicrous. These may in fact be people the author has worked with, \\"name dropping\\", trying to impress or prove qualifications, perhaps not. However the examples given, presumably as an instructional guide, are a mish-mosh of famous people of different races all lumped into the same class of color characteristic or \\"clarity\\" as the author puts it. Aside from the fact that it is hard to imagine 3 people of origins african, european, and mediteranian having the same color type, the way it is presented is absurd.   Color type defined in the Author's own words:    You are \\"contrast color type\\" if your hair color is brown to black. (so far so good) \\"your skin tone ranges from clear ivory, clear camel, and clear olive to dark brown. \\"  The author then goes on and gives examples of people of this type. \\"Robert De Niro, Colin Powell, Ben Affleck, and Elvis.\\"  Isn't that helpfull? Wait, it gets better.    You are a \\"Light- Bright color type\\" if \\"your natural hair color is golden blond to black, (but not red).\\" Examples of these include \\"Tiger Woods, Tom Brokaw, Pete Sampras, and Ricky Martin\\"    You are a \\"Gentle color type\\" if you resemble \\"Peter Jennings, Kobe Bryant, Matt Damon or Robin Williams.\\" \\"Your natural hair color is blond to black and includes some redheads.\\"    You are a \\"Muted color type\\" if you can compare yourself with \\"Micheal Jordan, JFK, or Elton John.\\" \\"Natural hair color ranges from blonde to black and includes some red heads.\\"    Wasn't that helpful? If not, the author suggests you hold up colors to your face in a mirror and the ones that look good are your colors and will define your type. That is the extent the author takes to explain and demonstrate her primary premise of the book. If you find this helpful and can now determine your own color type by this alone, (you will get no more) then by all means, get the book. However for the rest of you, it only gets worse.    The book is disorganized, and often times non-sensical. For some apparent reason, she feels that simply stating a point is not enough; it must be made stronger by increasing or decreasing the font size or adding or subtracting bold to increase her meaning. Great. Once, maybe twice. However, on one page alone I count different 5 instances. The text is full of the \\"technique\\". Comes off as annoying and amaturish.    Even with bad books, I tend to finish them, giving the author the benefit of the doubt and trying to see their point. I gave up 1/3 way through here with no regrets. Pure drivel, badly formated. Dis-organized and dis-jointed with little or no foundation or substantiation.    The author tries to pass herself off as an expert and says she gets paid to help famous and powerful people get the right look. They seems to have money to waste.     Since Amazon does not show it, her back cover photo can be described as this:   Head shot with companion in background. Presumably a candid photo. (in limo?) Dyed black hair with pasty \\"gothic\\" syle makeup. Face overly illuminated by the camera flash, partially (and perhaps mercifully) obscured by black fur of some sort. (my personal view would be to keep from being identified for the crime of authoring this book in a police lineup.) Photo is in fact, so vaugue that it is hard to determine what you are initially looking at. Much like the text. If that is the look she selects for herself for her book cover, can her advice for you be any better? Save your money. There are far better offerings out there.	2005-01-25

GREAT recipes, great humor in the form of phrases gathered from the restroom walls left by patrons of the resturant, (an encouraged practice at the Dinosaur), and lots of color photos. Sorry but my opinion is, what good is a cookbook if the author doesn't have the guts to show what they are presenting. Sure it's a cost factor in the production of the book, but a big purchasing factor for me. <br /> <br />This book is one of my all time favorites. Haven't had a bad recipe out of it yet and really don't expect to find one. The resturant is in up state New York, and I would love to get there one day, (may be a bit too close to an ex-wife however), to have some great food, and listen to some sweet and hot live blues the resturant also features. That should just about sum up the direction in food this book takes. Little fancy but all great, down home, rib stickin', diet bustin', soul feedin' fare. To heck with the ex., I'm off to the 'Saur! Even if it is only on my cookbook shelf right now.	2004-11-06

Mostly for the language the author chooses to use. ie: Buzz words, convoluted diagrams and marketing phrases. Biggest annoyance was the word &quot;Paradigm&quot; ( a word I tend to classify as the TV show, the Simpsons does, &quot;a word used by dumb people to sound smart&quot;) Deleation of this word alone from the book would have shortened it by at least 50 pages.<br />Don't get me wrong, there is some very worthwhile material here. I found some of it very relavent to my own life and needs. Through some judicious editing down to the worthwhile material, the author could have produced a very helpful pamphlet. However, the need to wade through the pages and pages of shlock made the book overall very tiresome. I have a hard time understanding how this was on the best sellers list until I remember the overall taste of the general population. Recall the popularity of pet rocks, disco, McDonalds, and reality tv. It helps explain this book's popularity.	2004-01-02
US	52982479	R21EPDS3B9WQ4C	055380202X	135474617	The Universe in a Nutshell	Books	2	5	16	N	Y	Disappointed	When I first saw this book in the store, I was thrilled. Combined with my previous experience with Hawking in &quot;A brief History of Time&quot;, and the color photos and diagrams in this volume, I thought this work held the promise of a very informative and understandable book.<BR>I was very much mistaken. The author jumps around so much that it becomes impossible to follow his train of thought. During the read, I went through the initial section somewhat perplexed. Upon the next section, the author seemed to take a more understandable tact and I started to believe the first section was there to offer initial exposure (and wonder), and then a better understanding would be provided later on in the text. Unfortunately this proved not to be the case.<BR>In the author's own words, many of the theories put forth are un-provable. Would have loved to know which ideas are based on solid scientific evidence and which are based solely on creative imagination.<BR>Overall, while reading the book I keep coming back to the same idea. Theoretical physists base their position and understanding of the universe on mathematics. In this case, mathematics so involved and convoluted that they become meaningless. By that I simply mean that one can use numbers to show anythng you want it to show. Reality based or not. One only has to look as far as a corporate balence sheet to see that. I have to say that it seems physics has gone off on a tangent of monumental proportions following a path of increasingly mis-leading formulas and the belief that if the numbers work, it must be right. <BR>For me, phisics is a facinating study and full of wonder and possibility. However, when a concept like Einstein's equivalency can be interpreted in a different way simply by understanding that equivalent does not mean the same. It means equal. In Einsteins elevator example you get the same effect, but is that because the actions are in fact the same or the results of different action? Every few years a new theory or postulate gets put forth and becomes the explaination du jour. One only has to look at the previous track record to cast doubts on the present theories.<BR>Perhaps I would not have as many misgivings about this book and what it puts forth if it were written in a more concise and understandable manner. Unfortunately it does not live up to Hawkings previous work in either information or delivery.	2003-05-11

As a former touring Bass pro myself, I have to say that Thomas &amp; Tucker capture what it is really like out on the professional fishing circuit. Perhaps the only thing missing or in error related to the book vs. the tour today is simply one of a forgiving level of competition. The book was written in the early 90's when a competator could have a bad tournament and still make the classic. Such is not the case these days in most situations. A single stumble can ruin a year's chance at the classic.<br />Otherwise, a great look inside a much mis-understood and little seen side of the sport.	2003-05-11
US	52982479	R1NF13O9RWKSPX	0793128544	995636662	100 Ways to Beat the Market (One Hundred Ways To Beat The Stock Market)	Books	2	3	3	N	N	Title for sales, not reality	As others say elsewhere, a book for beginners. However, I have to say that even beginners are going to be mis-lead because the book states one thing and delivers another. The very 1st chapter states the easiest way to beat the market is the simplest and most passive. Buy index mutual funds. The advice is sound, however, what the author promises is not. The problem is this: In buying a index fund, you will never &quot;beat the market&quot;. The best you will do is mirror the market and with mutual fund expenses, you will &quot;hopefully&quot; be close to market performance. This approach will NEVER be better than the market. It simply can't. I don't have an argument with the premise of buying index funds. However, the phrase &quot;beat the market&quot; means to do better than or out-perform it. The author apparently interprets this to mean, trail the market or come close to a tie and you beat the market. <BR>Also in the same section, the author recommends further diversification by purchasing 2 or 3 index funds. Diversify your diversified funds? Redundant and ridiculous. Advice for  &quot;...people who don't know what they are doing.&quot; Warren Buffet<BR>The one good part of this book is that each of the 100 sections starts with a great idea or quote. These I loved. However, of the sections I have read, not a one presents any idea or strategy for &quot;beating the market&quot;. <BR>Don't get me wrong, from what I have read, there are some good things to be found here. However, when the author fails to truthfully present or support the basic premise of the book, it makes the whole book suspect. Suggest the reader look elsewhere, (Search- 'Peter Lynch') and the author get a dictionary to look up the meaning of the words, 'beat' and 'mis-represent'.	2003-03-03

The main text was by other, unlisted writers who apparently needed Roland's name for marketing purposes. <BR>This is basically a picture book of bass fishing. Nice coffee table book for the angler's home, but not an educational offering. The photography is good but quite frankly, if you get Bassmaster or one of the other fishing magazines, you've already seen a lot of the pictures. Not my cup of tea but if a gift book for anglers is what you want, this could work.	2002-12-31

I wanted a book that gave me more insight into a great thinker. A mathamatician who gave us the theorum bearing his name.

First 3 chapters are largely repetitive. Found very little here that was helpful or insightful.

This book was difficult to get through, primarily because at least 100 of its pages are dedicated to complaining about what's wrong with the SEALS. What bad equipment they have, the political decisions in military appropriations, the lack of combat experience in commanders, the \\"ticket punch\\" syndrome of the military. None of these complaints are new and none are exclusive of the SEALS. If you have been in the military at all you have see all of it before. Some critisism is warrented and benificial. This book goes beyond that and made this reader yawn and turn a deaf ear after awhile. If the complaining wasn't enough, then the frequent reminders that the author had been on secret missions but could not talk about them certainly capped the book for me. I would have much preferred actual info on equipment, tactics, and training as opposed to complaints. Don't get me wrong, I am sure the author is an expert in his field and some of what he wrote was eye opening, particularly the Granada invasion.	2001-11-27

If you don't learn from this book, then you probably helped write it.	2001-06-29

Wrong. Wish I saw that it was a single 8 1/2x 11\\" laminated sheet of paper folded twice. (Although I think the discription I saw at the time listed it as \\"booklet\\")<br />OK, so there are color photos, (10) At least 1 was a poor choice for demonstrating the concept they were trying to show. (inside weed edge) Bottom line is all of the info here can be found elsewhere, with more complete explinations. Better to get a good book for $10-$20 than this single page for [price].<br />Would recommend this only for the most extreme beginner who wanted to carry a weatherproof example of what to do with them on the water. Though there is so little info here, it can easily be memorized quickly and left at home.	2001-06-09

For instance, did you know the catholic church had a list of banned books known as the Index that was in effect into the 1960's?  Catalogs a good cross section of books that have met with the disfavor of those in power through out the centuries. Is far from a complete list but takes you from books censored for hundreds of years on religious grounds to books people have sought to ban for the use of a single word.  Of particular interest is the recent ban attempts, (during the 1970's- 1990's) in the US by those who feel freedom of speech and the press is great as long as it meets their personal criteria. The fact that we can look at a book like this and see how far we have come is great. However, it means nothing if we stop defending the rights we claim to love.	2001-06-08
