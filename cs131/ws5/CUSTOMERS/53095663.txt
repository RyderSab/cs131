All that is missing is the Cloud Club.  But I'm still trying to figure out who David Stravitz is.  Certainly not the author.  Not one of the photographs is his.  By his own admission he stumbled across this work. The firm actually responsible, Peyser & Patzig does merit a few mentions but not on the cover or the title page.  Of course none of this detracts from the photos but as a photographer himself, Mr. Stravitz might be a little sensitive about taking credit for the work of others.  Even Christopher Gray, who contributes a lot more than Mr. Stravitz gets low billing.	2005-03-11

Have you ever read a \\"study\\" that contains tiny bits of truth (usually things that are obvious) but the rest is false?  That's the case with Generations At Work.<br /><br />If you remove the stereotypes all that remains is stuff that ought to be obvious.  It may be that some CEOs with large numbers of disgruntled employees are unaware of even the most blantant trends and conflicts in the workplace but the lesson there is to fix the workplace, not the employees.  All generations will be cynical if they are contstantly in danger of being laid off.<br /><br />From my own experience, 3 examples that are completely the opposite of what this book describes.  (1) People in my age group are supposed to be driven overachievers.  How I wish that were true.  Must have come from astrology or something.  (2) I worked for a company that hired two young \\"golden collar\\" tech experts.  These kids were outstanding.  There were no personality conflicts.  There were no generational conflicts.  And the fact that they were so knowlegable made us worship them!  So what if they preferred rock climbing to golf?  (3) Speaking of stereotypes, the company shut down and we all got laid off.  According to this book, young IT professionals can write their own ticket, right?  False, again.  Four months have passed and one of our young geniuses has a boring job with a long commute and big pay cut.  The other has refused to take a crummy job and remains unemployed.<br /><br />The book is not without humor, perhaps unintentional.  Apparently Lucent is a good example of how waring generations can make peace.  But I wonder how many managers want their company to perform as Lucent has.<br /><br />In the end, the key to a productive harmonious workplace is for people to have jobs they enjoy, pay well and are reasonably secure.  In a lesser work environment all managers can hope for is to tap into the stereotypes in this book to try to keep the dust down.	2005-01-24

Its hard to argue with the notion that life is more fulfilling if you do something you like.  So, if you are just starting out in life and have wealthy, supportive parents or you don't mind starving, by all means, go for it.<br /><br />But the bottom line is that these people are exceptions to the rule.  And they were lucky.  If all it took was hard work and a dream there wouldn't be a dentist or a tax preparer in America.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know what the answer is.  But I have noticed that many people who end up with dream jobs are folks who came from the wrong side of the tracks and thus had nothing to lose.  If this describes you, well, you have nothing to lose.<br /><br />So 3 stars for the entertainment but as a wise man once said \\"If you think you can't, you can't.

I've used Photoshop since v.2.5 and while there have obviously been hundreds of enhancements & improvements, Photoshop's complexity has increased dramaticly as well.<br /><br />Its really not fair to criticize RWPS for being such a brick.  You'll learn an important lesson just by picking it up.  Photoshop is many things but simple and user-friendly are not among them.  And with each new version of Photoshop, Adobe moves things around just to keep you guessing.<br /><br />So yes, its a bit of a slog (and don't forget the even better Real World Color Management) but in this user-friendly, digital age we just have to get used to thick books.	2004-09-12

If you want to know what Bill Fields had for lunch on a particular day, chances are the information is in this incredibly detailed book.<br />More to the point it turns out he was almost entirely different from what most people (including me) thought.  He was (1) extremely hard working & disciplined, (2) very smart and well read, (3) surprisingly kind and considerate, expecially given the very hard life he had.  While he ad libbed his lines, his best routines were rehearsed to perfection.  And he didn't hate children...only babies.  He DID despise politicians--in short, he was a great guy.<br />Unfortunately, his greatest accomplishments, Its A Gift and The Bank Dick, came late in his career (and 300 pages into the book) so if you're not interested in Vaudeville you're in for a long read.<br />All in all a fascinating story of a man who took what life gave him (nothing) and, realizing life is NOT a bowl of cherries, made us all laugh at the way people really behave and the way things often turn out.<br />The funniest guy who ever lived? I think so.  Do yourself a favor and hunt down You're Telling Me and Its A Gift.  And of course The Bank Dick.  And...please don't touch those lightbulbs, Mr. Muckle!	2004-04-11

(Diet books are a perfect example).<br />So, to minimize ABS, simply avoid the following:  Coffee, bacon, fried food, greasy food, vinegar, pepper, orange juice, grapefruit juice, red wine, all Thai food, all Vietnamese food, all Korean food, all spicy Chinese food, all acidic Italian food and Mexican food.  Japanese seems to be a toss up because wasabi--a sort of horseradish--does not smolder the way chili pepper does.<br />Of course everybody's different but much of this is a no-brainer, since stuff like greasy spice burgers are tough on everybody--not to mention, unhealthy.  And be aware that &quot;mild&quot; in a Thai restaurant translates to &quot;incendiary...but less so than our other entries&quot;.<br />Some will say this is a long list but you know the alternative....and loading up with white rice and bread may or may not help--while giving way too many carbohydrates and possible constipation.<br />I realize that some things cut both ways (no pun intended) like alchohol or mint or fiber.  Just depends on which book you read.  But do you really need a book to tell you to avoid pickles and pepperoni?<br />Reaseach suggesting IBS sufferers are worriers, agitated, &quot;high strung&quot; or whatever is encouraging.

I'm half way though this book and its obvious to me that much of  what he suggests is unknowable.  Buy when the market is going up.  Don't buy on the way down.  Don't wait for the absolute bottom.  Ask Jean Dixon for advice....<br />So what is one to do?  Aside from the fact that housing is something everybody needs, all I know is that people who bought houses in California for outrageously high prices...are now selling them for even higher prices.<br />And the same economic conditions that cause house prices to go up, also raise interest rates, making housing unaffordable.<br />The best time to buy a house is when you need one and can afford it.  As I write this the good news is that interest rates are incredibly low; the bad news is George Junior is running this country off a cliff.  Sure, its disconcerting but if you follow everything in this book the only home you'll be in the market for is a nursing home.	2003-04-15

Although not without errors this book is well illustrated and quite interesting.  The fact that Kesling may or may not have been a bit of a scoundrel only makes it more interesting.

I'm not an architect and therefore can only appreciate things that look good.  But I must tell you, compared to the houses they build today, Kesling's look mighty fine to me.  So lighten up, folks.

This is a superb book, not only for what it covers but for the clear and reasoned way the author explains things.  There are plenty of computer books, like the Real World series, that take things that are inherently complex and make them incomprehensible.  Mastering Digital Printing takes a different approach by telling you the state of the art and what you need to know, while explaining this in layman's terms.<br />What I especially like is the common sense approach he takes to issues like color management and permanence.  People would be well advised to take his advice, enjoy making prints and remember that Giclee is just a synonym for expensive inkjet print.<br />The only thing I question is the point made on pg. 185 that you should be concerned that images stored on CDRs will not be accessible in the future.  Its true that SyQuest drives have gone by the wayside.  But CDs are ubiquitous and there will be ample opportunity to transfer files to whatever comes along, long before the last CD or DVD drive dissapears.	2003-02-13

Desiging an exciting site that looks good on all monitors and with all browsers, is not fun, is not easy and is not user friendly.

(For men, I would also recommend Jama Clark's What The Hell Do Women Really Want).<br />The premise of Intimate Connections is that before anyone can love you, you must love yourself.  To do otherwise shows you are not thinking rationally.  And Dr. Burns tries to reason with the reader--to make the reader see they're not thinking clearly.  But if you're not thinking clearly, you may not be able to assimilate this advice.<br />Although perhaps unintentional, this emphasis on loving yourself and first having a good life on your own seems to be (wisely) creating a \\"fall back\\" position, in case, after giving it your best shot, things don't happen for you.  (Or in therapist's parlance, you are unable to make the necessary changes to make things happen).<br />A minor point is the section where a client feels he has shortcomings that women won't like.  After surveying some women, they say these things don't matter to them.  This unquestioning acceptance that women know and say what attracts them is kinda naiive for such a thoughtful book.	2002-05-13

This book runs along the same lines as the mother of all single-guy books, Jama Clark's What The Hell Do Women Really Want?  Its not as detailed as Jama's book but on the plus side Rom doesn't use a sledge hammer, thinking he can somehow shock you into changing your life.<br />Rom also devotes space to &quot;players&quot; who are guys that are good with women (but not sincere, blah, blah, blah...)  This may be true but I think its fair to say that guys who have the ladies lined up are not reading this book.<br />The deal is, once you start looking at yourself the way women do (which they deny but let's not go there) you suddenly see what's good and what's not.<br />Now conveying confidence when you're not confident is about as easy as looking financially well off when you're not.  But at least you know where you stand and can make a plan to get better clothes, workout, whatever.<br />Of course these things are superficial but if you think women can detect your great personality from across a room you're mistaken.  Rom's and Jama's books tell you how to create a package you can sell.  Even if their techniques didn't work all you would be stuck with is a higher level of fitness, a better apprearance and the confidence that goes with them.  So what's not to like?<br />Finally the true test of this type of book.  Women will find it offensive as hell--and that's as close to the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval as you can get.	2002-04-12

Nor does it matter that women will deny all this and find it offensive.  What matters is that this is the way things are.<br />Guess what--women are attracted to certain things (perhaps without being conciously aware) just as men are.  I'm not gonna say blondes have more fun--but your can bet SLIM blondes have more fun.  And so do tall guys with full heads of hair.<br />That's the good news.  The bad is that it will do you no good to sit at home, waiting to get taller.  And here is where this book with all of its superb explanations and clarity, breaks down:  what good is knowledge if you can't act on it?  You are what you are and you ain't what you ain't.<br />To put it another way, to be more successful with women, do the following:  (1) be positive (even when you are feeling absolute despair, (2) appear supremely confident (even when your knees are shaking), (3) be aggressive (even if that's simply not your personality), (4) be tall, (5) don't leave the house without a full head of hair, (6) dress expensively and well, (7) never appear needy (even if the women is a knockout and you haven't had a date in 4 years), (8) be lucky (perhaps you can will yourself to win the lottery, (9) Be yourself, so long as the previous points describe you., (10) Smile--get hold of some material from Eric Weber or Tony Robbins which is too hillarious to parody and take a step back and laugh!<br />I could go on but your success or lack of it will depend on your ability to adhere to the above points.  BTW, I met with Jama.  Didn't like her much but she had my number.  Took me a long time to grasp this but if you go to a therapist and its a pleasant experience you're in the wrong place.

The pictures are nice but there's a lesson here--in the way society rewards people.  I like the old Yes records as much as anybody, but not because of Steve Howe. His thickety-thickety tone & choppy, sloppy runs are not exactly soulful.<br />There are so many players, from shredders to jazz masters with real talent and heart. But this guy ends up with so much money, he can't spend it all.<br />By the way, not only does he take all these beautiful guitars out of circulation; he often carves them up with \\"modifications\\" some of which are bizarre to say the least (a Les Paul with 4 humbuckers?  Cool, Steve).<br />And don't forget to read about his guitar \\"tree\\" where he clamps the poor things to a wacky \\"lazy susan\\".  The only thing this collection is missing is one of those Hamer guitars with six identical necks, like Rick Nielson has.	2001-09-01

Its pretty obvious that this book is mostly stuff &quot;from the cutting room floor&quot; that didn't make it into the excellent Volume 1.  I'm sure a hell of a lot of work went into the very, very, very detailed chaper on Kay--but does anyone really care?  At best, this will drive up the price of some (mostly) lousy guitars.<br />I'm interested in the stories behind the companies and products but pages of serial number variations are like the tax code to me.<br />OTOH, some of this stuff--like Guild guitars--is not terribly obscure and probably already known to you, if you're over 30.<br />If the information on Guild could have been incorporated into the first volume I think the second would have been unneccessary.  There are a few nice color photos but if you're interested in cheesy guitars the author has contributed to a much more interesting &amp; thorough book, the Japanese published Bizzarre Guitars.  Though considerably more expensive, Bizarre Guitars is nothing but pictures and even in Japanese, mostly self-explanatory.<br />BTW, the introduction to Volume 2 is pretty funny;  almost Shakespearean in its language.  I can just imagine a guy in a pawn shop, shaking his head....	2001-08-31

No doubt this is all good advice--the authors are therapists and boy, does it show.  Problem is, if you could do all the things they suggest you wouldn't need a book.  Shy?  Solution:  Don't be.  Not assertive or overly assertive?  Solution:  Don't be.  And so it goes.<br />I can't imagine anyone who doesn't make some of the mistakes the authors describe--nor can I imagine anyone who could correct these just by reading this book.  (I'm not even convinced years of therapy would necessarily work but I digress).<br />To be fair, the authors pretty much say that you're gonna have to have a lot of dates, its likely to be a long process.  One thanks her family and friends for &quot;helping me maintain my sanity through all those years of dating&quot;.  Sounds like fun, doesn't it?	2001-06-23

First of all, there is nothing new here--and if you're not aware that women prefer men who do not smoke &amp; wear clean clothes well, you need a copy of Stupidity For Dummies.  Mr. Wray does a great job of conveying what women SAY they want and how to be the friend a woman turns to when she's having trouble with the guy who turns her on.<br />The author says he consulted a lot of women, and it shows.  The entire thrust (sorry, ladies) of this book is,  you must do everything possible to make yourself worthy of a woman's hand.  As you might expect, the &quot;S&quot; word comes up only at the very end after 200+ pages of relentless self-improvement.  The list is long and the tone of the book is anything but &quot;lighthearted and entertaining&quot;.<br />While the book is padded with diet, excersise, mortality statistics and so on, its quite ambiguous about stuff that has to do with dating.  For a guy who goes into such detail as remember not to fart, you'd think there would be better advice than stuff about pretending to be confident when you're not (why not pretend to be rich while you're at it).<br />At the very end he says &quot;When the results are less than you expect, you find yourself feeling worse than when you used to just lay around watching TV&quot;.  Exactly--and that's life.  But why pay for a book to tell you this?	2001-03-25

A fascinating gathering of some of the trivial details thatreally DO describe what it felt like (or must have felt like).

This book tries to simplfy what cannot be  simplified so those who need basic instruction that takes nothing for  granted will be lost.  On the other hand, those who want to spend their  lives designing a web page will find there is so much complexity to GoLive  that (obviously) a &quot;quickstart guide&quot; cannot cover it all.
