That is to say, the writing and the fluidity of Gazzara's life become bland and uninteresting quite fast.  <br />I initially picked it up because as an actor I find biographies or autobio's about somewhat lesser known people more curious than approaching someone like Paul Newman or Brando, who each have several books...And Gazzara's career has been an intruiging one. As a member of the Actors Studio, which produced the aforementioned actors along with countless others, his rise to Broadway and Hollywood was quick. He originated Brick in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, and played his first film for Otto Preminger-opposite James Stewart and George C. Scott, among others-in Anatomy of a Murder.  <br />But his approach to acting, which is of primary importance to me, was not chronicled. Instead he regales with stories of what and who the people he worked with were like. What the particular country he was shooting in was like, etc., etc.  <br />One of his primary sources of regard is his work with John Cassavetes, and it is clear Cassavetes was a major influence and close friend, someone Gazzara owes much, and the process by which they created Husbands and other films is investigated more than any other. Cassavetes too comes out as a more interesting, Larger Than Life guy, while Gazzara's tales of living in Italy, or being in Spain, New York, Hollywood, the Philippines, etc., etc. just made me jealous... <br />I guess I wanted to know more about the life of an Actor who has worked as long as Gazzara has, is still relatively known-but never became a \\"star,\\" and continues to work, without feeling he is a hack who doesn't take his work seriously...	2005-10-04

This is a somewhat telling study of the effect of violent entertainments throughout (Western) history on populations. The essential argument that Schechter challenges is that today's movies, television, video games, and pop culture in general are inspiring violence in the youth of America. This is an idea put forth by \\"worried\\" politicians and social thinkers who are at loses to explain and eleviate crime. Savage Pastimes then is his continued picking apart of that argument, with an emphasis that today's cultural entertainments are not only not more violent then those of past generations, but less. The seeming truism that the more things change, the more they stay the same, also holds court.<br /><br />Schechter also points out to great and feeling effect, the essential need of violence in human history/experience. As civilization evolves, violence has become fictionalized, taking the place of brutality that we recognize we are better without. But the visceral and primal lusts of humanity bear respect, and entertainment has proven the vehicle for their experience.<br /><br />While graphic (and interesting) in depiction, explanation and representation of past entertainments; penny dreadfuls, public executions, public displays of body parts, pulp/dime novels, western-themed t.v. shows, etc., Schechter counters their substance with little to no modern examples, other than mention of video games such as Resident Evil and movies like The Matrix. Now that may be efficient to a point, these games and movies being incredibly popular, their substance may not be necessary to express. But his point in made. I tend to agree more then not, and think the book succeeds.<br /><br />I also found his scholastic refutation of common ideology appealing because his is a calming voice, one that cuts through the politicized subject of entertainment.	2005-07-19

There is a line in The Day of the Locust: \\"The Sun is a joke.\\" This two story collection is no joke though. Here are stories that tear up and don't shy away from digging into the deep pain and anguish of the collective American Nightmare.  <br />Miss Lonelyhearts, the early eqivalent of Dear Abby is not even a Miss, but a shocked, overwhelmed Mr. whose attempt to humorously capitalize on the dread of New York life has bitten him back. So much so that his life has exposed itself as one of equality to that of his desperate, ever hopeless readers.   <br />The Day of the Locust though is West's searing expression of the lie of the California Golden Good Life, that attracted the industrial stunk multitudes from the greased, tenament East, what with Sun and Oranges flowing and inspiring stardom and attainable beauty. An even more gut wrenching tale than Miss Lonelyhearts, Locust beautifully captures the seedy Hollywood that dominates under the shadows of movie glory and stifling wealth.  <br />Tod Hackett is an up and coming set and costume designer, a drawer by trade, who comes to Hollywood by way of Yale, and still finds it glorious and inspiring at the story's open. But his futile attraction to the burning Faye Greener, and caustic existence as one of several suitors exposes the depths of depravity and the harsh environment that Hollywood truly is.  <br />West's brilliant writing creates thoroughly vivid scenes of hysterical expressions; in particular, Harry Greener, Faye's vaudvillian father and his psychological collapse, Homer Simpson's (perhaps an inspiration for the latter beloved 'toon father?) slowly mounting paralysis and abuse at the hands of Faye, and the swellinig frenetic energy Faye inspires in the gathering of men she attracts, who over run the home she shares with Homer. But the grittiest, most incredible description comes later, when the collective, primal force of star struck, desperate Californians morphs into a crowd of rioters, swarming as the titleimplies in for the killing of one of their (our) own. <br />Both of these are doomed stories. And though written in the 30's, they hold the eternal forces of human nature within them. Forces of desperation, hope, competition, attraction, sexual domination and subservience, dreams of glory, loathing and psychological tumult. Living in Los Angeles today, The Day of the Locust is as apt a tale now as it has ever been.  <br />\\"What a perfect escape the return to the womb was. Better by far than Religion or Art or the South Sea Islands. It was so snug and warm there, and the feeding was automatic. Everything perfect in that hotel. No wonder the memory of those accomodations lingered in the blood and nerves of everyone. It was dark, yes, but what a warm, rich darkness. The grave wasn't in it. No wonder one fought so desperately against being evicted when the nine months' lease was up.\\"	2005-06-18

Capturing the spirit of a young man on the verge of losing himself in his stung and strung emotions, Vincent in Brixton succeeds as a suggester, an appetizer of sorts, a brief encounter with van Gogh-before painting, before madness.<br /><br />It is a slight read, an hour's worth, and dabbles healthily into not only van Gogh's nature, or his appreciation for melancholy, but others attraction to it as well.<br /><br />Having lived in London already, Vincent is moving, on a whim, into the boarding house of Ursula Loyer, a widower who runs the house and a school with her young daughter Eugenie. Sam Plowman is the other boarder, fledgling artist and would be competition for Eugenie.<br /><br />But the story turns up a notch when it takes an surprising turn, and gets into the meat of what van Gogh was about, a man unafraid of himself, to let flow his feelings and impulses. As his heart was forming, so was his art. This was a time before he was painting and in the play he first begins to find an emotional value in drawing. His appreciation for empty chairs, rain-soaked vagabonds and beaten up boots only appears after his life, lead in part by his vaunting emotional state, ceases being bourgeois-interested, and his heart breaks.<br /><br />Vincent in Brixton is an illumination of a different man, with a different soul. Before Holland, loneliness, addiction and obsession and a revolution in expression immortalized him, he was a drifter like many others, following his heart and come what may...	2005-04-30

This was a surprisingly good play by Miller, which starts oddly and builds to a poignant and telling conclusion.   Through his humanistic and socially reverent touch, this long one act developes the comings and goings of an auto parts factory in 1933 into an dance of (mostly) men stuck in the folds of industry and The Depression.   The primary character is Bert, an 18 year old trying to save for college, who gradually realizes the beauty and sorrow of his co-workers, men and women who come to work to escape life, and drink to escape life and live for each other, dream of each other and share their lives.   Besides Bert, Kenneth is an Irishman newly in America, who's poetic recitations serve as lessons and entertainment for Bert. There is Tom Kelly, a long time employee and stone drunk, who recognizes the power of will, and Gus, a Slavic Bull, another longtime employee, and passionate drunk, who gives into his instincts. The hope and excitment of a new car with great valves becomes the financial burden of dreams for Larry, and the seventy-something Jim scrapes on, working and harkening back to a more raw America, if such a thing is possible.   Sadness pervades this story. Bert will leave, and be forgotten. Kenneth will drink himself to foolishness and abandon the heart that shares poetry with any and all. Says Kenneth late in the play, when asked of the poems he seems to be forgetting, \\"No they're gone Bert. There's too much to do in the country for that kinds stuff.\\"  Written in 1955, the rise of Hitler in Germany marks the play, as Bert shares with the others The New York Times. Bert will probably go to war in 1941, these men will keep working, dreaming and drinking their lives through. Cogs in a wheel of progress and sorrow.   Again Kenneth, after Bert leaves:  \\"The Minstrel Boy to the war is gone, in the ranks of death you will find him. His father's sword he has girded on, And his wild harp slung behind him.\\"	2005-04-13

Coming from an insolated society, which held it's traditions of theatre very stringently, to communities of distinct openness, and other artists and cultures proves astonishing, frightening, discomforting and essential to the path of Yoshi Oida. <br />Eventually he describes his experiences away from the CIRT/CICT, creating theatre and experiencing spiritual rites of passage on his nomadic quest, one which baffles and excites him continually.  <br />From an actor's perspective, Oida is a master. Capable of deeply recognizing and communicating the necessities and possibilities of theatricality and surely of creating them.  <br />He has a clear reverence for Peter Brook, who's directing prowess and leadership inspire and amaze Oida. He quotes freqently from him, including a remarkable bit from The Shifting Point, a book by Peter Brook: \\"We are trying to discover something, to discover it through what we make, for other people to take part in. In demands a long, long preperation of the instrument that we are. The question always is: are we good instruments? For that we have to know: what is the instrument for? The purpose is to be instruments that transmit truths which otherwise would remain out of sight.\\" <br />Such directness and depth is a hallmark of Brook, why he is so reverved by Oida and others, and it is unified in Oida himself. From page 159: \\"...we must aim at transcending the level of shortlived pleasure and superficial skills. Only then can the actors and the audience walk together on a path to another existence.\\" <br />This is acting as high artistry, cultivated through decades of specific training, experience and understanding. This is acting that I strive for, acting which recognizes the craft as one of ancient societies, priests, gurus, temples, transcendence, community, power, heart, and deep reverence.	2005-04-13

A fluid horror story of a young man's efforts to get out from under the death of his own sister, at his \\"hands.\\"  <br />The play leaves no doubt-it's the first line, and on the back of the book that \\"Fifteen years ago I killed my sister\\" is the central point in this man's life.  <br />Though a play, it is written in such a way that one actor could do all the speaking, though a cast list features a sister, mother, father and girlfriend.  <br />A short read, it is wondefully written, full of literary nostalgia, and images of sensational pain and wonder.  <br />A family destroyed; a sister dead, a mother broken, a father paralyzed and a son shaken. Such a tale comes to good, as the situation and the characters are brought alive in a vivid way.	2005-04-08

Nothing is left but our memory of life. Not as it is...as it might have been....\\"<br /><br />So says Leo, soft natured, burnt out, over worked, unappreciated, hang dog Odetian father in Paradise Lost. But such sentiment could come from any of these six plays and not be out of place.<br /><br />In these six plays, featuring some of the most brilliant and emotional American playwriting ever, Clifford Odets hammered and chiseled circumstances of urban American life in the 1930's. Full of hard edged people who demand it of others, and naive people who refuse to be brought down by the prevailing winds, Odets creates a world that may seem dated and bygone. But the turmoil and the choices are neither.<br /><br />In Waiting for Lefty taxi cab drivers must contend with horrendous working conditions, including violence and intimidation from managment if they strike. Scenes from worker meetings, home life between a husband and wife on the edge, and between two scientists politicing towards blacklisting and espionage.<br /><br />In Awake and Sing and Paradise Lost families living in small cramped apartments must strive for peace and simple comforts while income is barely enough, their children, desperate for a better life, risk their lives through crime, or take up with sordid, cynical and compromised people. Homes are taken away, suicides and paralysis grip them.<br /><br />In Till the Day I Die, two brothers go from being tight excited comrades, rebelling against the Fascist Nazi encrouchment, to being torn apart and suspicious after one of them is captured, tortured, abused, compromised and released.<br /><br />In Golden Boy, the sweet heart of a promising violinist turns grey and aggressive when he takes up boxing, letting success, hatred for his family and fear of failure lead him to his own destruction.<br /><br />In Rocket to the Moon a dentist falls for his young secretary, who dreams of a better life, beyond a hard scrabble existence as three men vie for her affections.<br /><br />All the writing is incredible. A few noteworthy quotes:<br /><br />From Till the Day I Die:<br /><br />Ernst: Yes, peace! in the cell there-I know I stayed alive because I knew my comrades were with me in the same pain and chaos. Yes, I know that till the day I die there is no peace for an honest worker in the whole world.<br /><br />Tilly: Till the day I die there is steady work to do. Let us hope we will both live to see strange and wonderful things. Perhaps we will die before them. Our children will see it then. Ours!<br /><br />Ernst: These guns are complicated pieces of machinery. Our Germans make them like works of art. Tilly, Carl, our agony is real. But we live in the joy of a great coming people! The animal kingdom is past. Day must follow the night. Now we are ready: we have been selected in a terrible fight, but soon all the desolate places of the world must flourish with human genius. Brothers will live in the societs of the world! yes, a world of security and freedom is waiting for all mankind! Do your work, comrades.<br /><br />From Paradise Lost:<br /><br />Kewpie: A sleeping clam at the bottom of the ocean, but I'll wake you up. I'm through with the little wars: no more hacking, making a pound in a good day. Like old man Pike says, every man for himself nowadays, and when you're in the jungle you look out for the wild life.

This is the first bell hooks I have read, and was deeply impressed by her clear, rooted moral position on the state of American and global society. Her writing in this piece shifts from a narrative of her own history growing up in the South, to a present academic, political critique of today.  <br />I found her writing fluid and her point of view significant. As a black woman in America and someone who has experienced lower and upper class existence and the according journey between them, her perspective is complex, making her voice deep and necessary.  <br />In no way can I specify difference with this book. She calls for a morally just society, which denounces the consumerism that perpetuates exploitation, racism, sexism while it is advertised and fantasized about as a life pursuit. Seeing the current issue of Newsweek's cover story, titled \\"How to Win,\\" regarding a CEO's expertise in making money and succeeding the \\"American way,\\" immediately brought Where We Stand into consideration.  <br />This book is a call to action, and an illumination of the depressing and unjust, cruel and foolish system which ignores and is afraid of reforming itself enough to allow for \\"a world where we can all have enough to live fully and well.\\" <br />I particularly appreciated her chapters on living simply, and think it is an appropriate and bold call to make in a place where stuff and acquisition are social symbols of significance.  <br />To conclude, I found this description of class from page 103, by Rita Mae Brown, to be important: \\"Class is much more than Marx's definition of relationship to the means of production. Class involves behavior, your basic assumptions, how you are taught to behave, what you expect from yourself and from others, your concept of a future, how you understand problems and solve them, how you think, feel, act.\\"	2005-04-04

The characteristic strongest in Running Dog is ominous suspense, a coming-to from any angle. While it suffers from the De Lillo style of excessive psycho-analysis/stream of consciousness association, it is made up of meetings, usually between two people, sometimes three, in varied and interesting places.  <br />An airplane sauna, in a car heading south on a straight highway, a Nude Reading room, an art gallery/apartment, a vollyball court in Central Park where tennis is being played, a limousine with St. Bernard puppies, a fire escape, magazine offices, an abandoned espionage training facility, a motel in the woods, a minibus, Capitol Hill, a Georgetown home, an apartment roof, and more.  <br />At these places peoples jockey for information or sexual connection, seeking the treasure which incites them all, directly and indirectly into a void of contact and codes.  <br />I found Running Dog engrossing, and was amazed at De Lillo's capacity for langauge and image. His dialogue scenes begin without formality and are influenced as much by the memory or his characters as their present intentions.  <br />Searching for a long lost film which may or may not come to rank as a legendary smut film, over a dozen characters cross paths in attempts toward victory and knowledge. Time and space shifts across the country, and an America of double and triple dealings, hidden collections and taboo tastes, lost and won partnerships skirts along toward understood oblivion.	2005-03-30

Mamet quotes Hemingway among others here, \\"write the best story you can and then throw out all the good lines,\\" as the best advice he ever heard about writing.  <br />This is essential to the style and grace of Mamet's writing, in that he sloughes off so much in the way of explanation to take the reader on a journey into his mind and life.  <br />And his mind is expansive and connected, aware and developed so much that this collection of essays, regarding numerous subjects becomes a treatise on Mamet's morality and appreciation for and of life at the end of the 20th century. <br />Opening with his turning fifty, a mood that pervades the whole, he discusses his youth in Chicago, the meta-physical nature of a similar black sweater to bygone ones, the zone of owning a poker game, what it is to be a Scotch Whiskey connesiour, homes and their qualities, Hollywood and it's ironies, a \\"perfect\\" first car, the nature of man to desire enslavement, the coming and existent domination of computers and television in human life, fearful witch hunting, why bigots are afforded their prejudice, and the attempt to master nature-in the form of a buck deer. Among others, these encompass an interesting and fluid jam into life through David Mamet. <br />Now, beyond skimming over what he writes about, there is much to say as to what he says. Why is there a folklore about John Henry defeating the machine drill, celebrating his accomplishment when he died immediately following? \\"I thought it hypocritical to celebrate John Henry's victory, for, surely, the next man couldn't beat the steam drill-John Henry himself couldn't beat it over a protracted period, and no one would be able to vanquish the next generation of the machine-and, so, our celebration of hime was disingenuous.\\"  <br />As to anti-semitism, \\"it is caused by self-loathing. The deranged individual or culture, the oppressor, cannot bear the knowledge of his or her own worthlessness and, so, projects the hated qualities onto a group easily identified as the Other. The only other necessary factor is that the group elected must be seen as powerless.\\" There must be a response then to bigotry, complicity/silence is acceptance, and that response is \\"not for the sake of the bigot but for the sake of the recipient Jew-to proclaim and, so, to enjoy one's membership in the group.\\" <br />On a lighter or perhaps more artistically anguished plane, Mamet exposes, as he is known for, the abominable Hollywood machine, which deals in destruction and is lead by fools who happen to have gorgeous homes full of incredible decor and artwork. The irony is that these people don't know, or care, they only pay, that is what they are good for, using money to look good, becaus ethey are supposed to, much to that chagrin or Mr. Mamet and the rest who hope to appreciate what they earn.  <br />Surprisingly there is humor too, and more. I would read this again, and mark that as a distinguishing factor in any reading and writing. He does not though, wrote much about theatre, or acting, except for an analystical bit on why The Diary of Anne Frank is not a tragedy, nor a drama, but a comedy. For such clarifications and views, read this and perhaps appreciate the mind and heart of an important and qualified American voice.	2005-03-23

It seems actually that the author saw what remarkable qualities Norton represented as a story, but had to build around him another story.  <br />This other story is of a young man's journey west, from Boston at the height of the rush to California.  <br />He travels by boat, south past the Cape of Good Hope and through the Golden Gate. Then from a burgeoning San Francisco towards Sacramento and the Sierra Nevadas and Sutter's Fort, where anyone with a prayer and some tools seems to have come seeking the proverbial pot of gold and a life of luxury and joy.  <br />Through this journey he meets other wild and interesting chracters, interspercing his relationship with Joshua Norton throughout. Eventually he, Norton and others we've met on the way venture for gold and find adventure, life lessons and violence.  <br />All of this culminates as a backstory for who, what, why and how Joshua Norton, a South Africa of English and Jewish descent, became Emperor Norton I, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico.  <br />In truth that build up is interesting, engaging and vibrant. But perhaps a tact regarding this not as a historical and fictional biography, but as a historical fiction of San Francisco and environs as of the Gold Rush era would have been better. Because it is not just \\"the Remarkable Story of Joshua Norton Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico.\\" It is other things and about other people.  <br />But for San Fran lovers, natives or transpants, Gold Rush enthusiasts, eccentric character fans, or Westward Ho! affecianatos this is a good book. It paces along well, and retains a youthful attitude toward a rough time and seemingly barbaric place, where people with kind hearts, rascals, rogues, inventors, eccentrics and lost souls converged to create the most beautiful of American cities, one which I in all bias call home, and one which it may be said cherished and enjoyed (even to this day) the likes of Joshua Norton, aka Emperor Norton I.  <br />	2005-03-19

Much meaner than The Piano Lesson, though no less fierce in it's symbolism, depth, rawness and emotional power. Fences is Troy Maxson. In Troy Maxson is every hard scrabble, dis-respected, dis-regarded soul, whose lot in life has been given to them by fools, and who can never let up against the demons and dread of a life unfair and barely endurable. That's not to say Maxson is a downer of a guy. He's a force, and one of the toughest characters I've read in a play.   His family, made up of a younger wife, Rose, an adult child, Lyons, from a previous marriage, a teenage son, Cory, with Rose, and a battle scarred younger brother, Gabriel, all orbit around him. His presence is daunting and secure, his past is too and his struggle with a faultering home life takes all of his considerable might.   What makes Fences so good is the brilliant flowing dialogue, featuring one character after another seemingly attacking the situations they are in, full of spirit, experience and interest.   The generational divide so prevalent a story line is here, and the equally common tradition of a father and son at odds, except in perpetuating their antagonism is too.   The sins of the father have come down, been bequeathed to everyone, as have the forces of a society apathetic to unequality.  A classic American play, and the best of a phenomenal writer.	2005-03-19

The most significant aspect of this book is Tucker's imperative respect for the First Folios. These earliest of Shakespearean texts, which feature spelling errors and a messier type set, offer and the book tries and proves over and over, the best acting/performance texts.  <br /> <br />The distinction between acting/performance texts and scholastic/reading ones is essential, as Tucker again and again subverts the modern editions of Shakespeare, and the editors, who continually add and make scholastic/academic assumption as to the intent of the texts. These editors reduce the active nature of the texts and \\"regularize\\" over and over what the original actors had to work with.  <br /> <br />Through the Original Shakespeare Company, which he co-founded, Tucker and his actors approach the texts as the actors who originated them did. This was by using no rehearsal time, and giving each actor only the texts they speak and the appropriate cue lines, allowing for a spontaneous and urgent playmaking which heightens the already heightened Shakespeare.  <br /> <br />Through this approach, which originally was one of practicality, the actors tasks are enhanced. Listening becomes that much more important, as do the choices each actor must make based soley on the texts which are devoid of modern directions and edits; such as to who to speak to, whether or not a speech is an aside, particular capitalization and punctuation and stage business.  <br /> <br />For anyone who performs Shakespeare this is a terrific book. As well for directors this may even be better. Tucker breaks down the \\"original approach\\" in the early part of the book. Then spends the largest chunk detailing the experiments he and his company made with this approach, beginning with scenes through full text performances. There is then a terrific section devoted to particular ways of finding the secrets in the text, and the associated choices one can make on stage.  <br /> <br />While the section about the details ofthe company's performances is too long and sometimes repetative, the book is a revelation. Anyone willing to try this style would surely feel the difference, as an audience would too.By scrapping the modern trappings of what theatre is, to reduce it to it's leanest and most energetic, magnetic form in the use of the phenomenal texts of Shakespeare can realize the power of theatre and clarify it's immortal importance and necessity.	2005-03-14

While Stephen Adly Guirgis has become over the past few years a playwright who has established himeself as one of America's most interesting and bright, Den of Thieves marks a shakey beginning.  <br />The characters, all funny, quirky and contradictory in standard literate comedy terms hold up better than the story, which seems desperate and caught up in it's own funkiness.  <br />If for another reason than an early work by Guirgis, Den Of Thieves offers funny dialogue and bombastic characters.	2005-03-14

While in a production of Hamlet, playing among others, Fortinbras, I recalled hearing of this play. As well cast mates and I debated about a play ala Rosencranz and Guildenstern Are Dead, that comes from Hamlet, and takes on questions about those remaining alive. Well, here is Fortinbras. <br />Opening as Hamlet ends, Fortinbras arrives into a kingdom-for-free and takes on what Hamlet showed to be a rotten state in Denmark. Very much humor ensues, as Horatio and Osric, the only survivors who witnessed the end of the royal family, attempt to adaprt to this new careless ruler.  <br />This is a great read. Quick, funny, clever and easy going. If someone wanted to be very bold, a production of this tied into Hamlet would be an amazing ride.	2005-03-14

Boys Gets Girl is a dark play, which builds and builds toward a strong and very effective conclusion. Again Rebecca Gilman presents a social issue, in The Glory of Living it was poverty and violence, in Spinning Into Butter it was liberal/academic racism and in Boy Gets Girl it is stalking.  <br />Without giving away the story: Theresa is a hard working journalist who doesn't date. When a friend sets up a blind date for her which starts well, only to deteriorate over time, Theresa's life is thrown into a tail spin. <br />That's a general look at the story. But the excellent part of Boy Gets Girl is the depth to which Gilman focuses on male/female relationships. Are they social games we play or do people of opposite sexes have biologically accute responses to each other, and is such behavior inherited or learned. Is the cliched \\"chase\\" or \\"pursuit\\" which Mercer regards as an archetypal story (in which the boy sees, the girl doesn't, the boy pursues, the girl ignores, the boy persists, the girl rejects, the boy persists, the girl relents, etc., etc.) borne of necessity or too many romantic books or movies?...So sets up an investigation by not only Theresa, but her co-workers, interviewees and other characters, into what it is to be a sexual animal today. She regards why and what men and women think about each otehr, and the ramifications.  <br />For a gripping, difficult, occasionally scary play, which deals with socially significant issues, Gilman deserves much credit.	2005-03-10

In it Wallace Shawn creates a world, similar to our own, in an unknown country or time, which could be America, in which the intellectual minority, which regards the ignorant majority as The Enemy, suffers the rebellion of the masses, and the end of it's superior hold on quality and acceptibility.  <br />Sound political? This could be France on the verge of Revolution, or Russia or any place where thought and a deep seeded \\"knowledge\\" of what is worthy and unworthy in the world remains the whimsical argument of the upper class.  <br /> <br />What makes it even more amazing is the shadows and mystery of the story. Jack, the main character, is a man who has never liked the upper class circles he and his wife and father swim in. And when such associations become dangerous, his position adapts. Intent of survival, and curious about revenge, he realizes his experience, having existed in both upper and lower classes gives him a level of understanding which can only be mourned over.  <br /> <br />A stand out paragraph: \\"After a while I just concluded there wasn't any hope-an importnant insight. There'd be no happiness in my own life, nor would peace be won in the world at large. Was there anything, then that I could expect to achieve in the coming years? Well, perhaps I could somehow train my mind to focus less compulsively on terrifying images of death and disease. Perhaps I could learn how to pass more easily from one moment to the next, the way the monkey, our ancestor, shifts so easily along from branch to branch as he follows the high road through the forest at night. Let me learn how to repose in the quiet shade of a nice square of chocolate, a nice slice of cake. A delicious cup of tea isn't, perhaps, that hard to come by; the trick to be learned is just not to think of other things while you drink it.\\"-Page 75-76	2005-03-10

This is a play that begins as a jumble and ends as a eulogy and round for the lost souls of urban streets. Here are two dozen characters, junkies, hustlers, prostitutes, pimps, dealers, in a swarm of common addiction and stricture, craving, wandering, over and over in a cycle of highs and hopes.  From the jumble of multiple conversations at once, comes the heart of the story, Darlene and Joe, who meet at the cafe where everything takes place, learn about each other, he an old hand in the neighborhood looking to riase himself, she a new girl in town, already down on her luck and looking for contact. Their story is the point of the play, along with the purposely repetative behavior and dialogue of those around them.  While reading this isn't that easy, because Wilson intertwines three and four dialogues together, there is a sense for the mayhem and chaos that surrounds all these people. In the end, through song and a chorus of understanding, the hope for a Balm in Gilead remains.   This also features several incredible monologues, from Dopey, Rake and Darlene, each expressing the harshness and wonder of urban life.	2005-03-09

While Field has been touched by beneficial timing, and influential relationships, he has developed through diligence a perspective and vision for film, screenplays in particular.<br />While the book begins as an autobiography: school, wanderings, discovering film, school, early work, etc., it developes into a book of analysis and technique. In that way it went from good to okay. His working at Wolper Productions, his relationship with Jean Renoir and Sam Peckinpah all are interesting views of film making and film makers. I wish there was more of that. In fact, after a half chapter plus on Citizen Kane, in a following chapter Field talks about working at Wolper on a series hosted by Joseph Cotton. But there is no regarding of Cotton's involvement in the most influential of films.<br />Through script reviewing at Wolper Productions he developes a style and level of efficiency which begins to translate itself into a writing career. He survives off of optioned scripts for several years before he begins teaching. From this point on he becomes more of an advisor, and leads up to his place today as a formidable screenplay expert.<br />Within this arc, from autobiography to technical manual there is interesting and insightful writing on film, it's brilliance, influence, form and power. A decision on whether or not to make this a technical book about writing a screenplay or a memoir about a life in the film business would have improved this book.	2005-03-07

Juxtaposing time in between paragraphs, letting  information and nuance about Jean Brodie, her girls, her loves, opinions, style and difficulties, trickle out lightly before revealing the truth of the matter, Spark is in full control.  <br /> <br />There is a psychology to her creation of the Brodie Set, the girl with Insight, the girl with Instinct, the Dumb girl, the girl known for her Anger, the Actress, the Athletic girl, all lead by Miss Jean Brodie, who never fails to remind them all, and herself, that she is \\"in her prime.\\" And by this, her ideas, passions and dreams are revealed, to and onto the girls, to tragic, shameful and interesting conclusions.  <br /> <br />This is a classic book, for many reasons.

The best play of Tennessee's late period, The Night of the Iguana features one of his best characters, in the shape of Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon, a self-hating, sexually angst ridden, anti-reverend, for whom life is now breaking down, again. <br /> <br />Into the hidden Mexican hotel run by the America ex-pat Maxine comes Shannon, again to reconcile his life, where he meets the vagabond painter Hannah and her 97-years-young poet grandfather. <br /> <br />Shannon has been leading tours throughout the world over the years since his explosion at the pulpit propelled him out of the church's favor, and now he has abandoned a busload of Texas women who are fed up with his philandering and his off-the-beaten-path tactics.  <br /> <br />All of the drama and trauma of classic Tennessee Williams is here. The tortured Reverend, at odds with God in such a cruel world. A man whose sexuality has been more detrimental than pleasurable. As well, there is Maxine, a middle aged widower, stuck or something like it in Mexico, running a cheap, rough and tumble hotel, far away from the nonsense of cities and America. Then, the spirited Hannah, who takes to Shannon as he to her, in a feeling out of hard hearts, and lonelinesses.  <br /> <br />Better than most of his plays, The Night of the Iguana succeeds in it's treatment of lost souls, and the meeting of two people destined for loneliness and disappointment.	2005-03-02

Fast paced, violent and cruel play about a lowlife, Raul, who intrudes upon Marjorie, an unemployed young woman. He attempts to rape her, but she swiftly turns the tables, caging him in a fireplace and torturing him.  <br />This isn't giving away the story, because the significance of Extremities is in the behavior, especially of Marjorie, toward Raul, and her roommates, Patricia and Terry, who both come home and must deal with the situation.  <br />What makes Extremities interesting is the sort of fatal hand of timing, in that Marjorie seems to be at her wits end, and Raul's presence precipitates an unraveling that exposes the animal and the pain and anger in a young woman. <br />The writing is fast paced, full of colloqueal slang, raw and brazen in it's frayed nerves.  <br />This is a quick read, and would be interesting and intense to see on stage.	2005-02-28

Practically autobiographical, Full of Life tells the tale of Fante and his pregnant wife, Joyce, as well as his father and mother. It is beyond anything, a message of beauty, joy, wonder, astonishment, blissfulness, impending fatherhood, family and love. <br /> <br />Written in a most direct and simple style, Fante expresses very succinctly the emotions of a soon-to-be father, and the rises and falls of being married to a woman who is pregnant for the first time. His trepidation, her alterations at the hands of hormonal shifts and their fluctuating connections to each other, make for a sweetness, pervasive throughout the book, that inspires the deepest of respect for marriage, coupling and home.  <br /> <br />When a surprising home accident occurs, Fante decides to venture to his parents home in the Sacramento Valley, from Los Angeles where he and Joyce live in their newly purchased house. His father and mother, the very image of emotional, visceral, animated Italian immigrants, welcome and cajole him, as his appearance is unanticipated. Papa Fante was for many years a bricklayer, and John hopes to engage him in help for his own home, unsure of the high costs hiring out will bring. After some dramas, Papa and son return to L.A., where the coming child brings together Joyce and her father-in-law, leaving John to struggle with issues of marriage, son-hood, fatherhood, and Joyce's new found religion, as if alone.  <br /> <br />In the end, Full of Life is an interesting, beautifully written, funny, sweet story of family, in the best sense. The emotions of everyone involved, the observances of scathing insecurity which Fante makes of himself and those around him, the sense of warmth and hope, make this a superb experience. Another terrific time with the Great John Fante.	2005-02-24

This is a fabulous, interesting read, a book of essays by Didion, regarding the 1960's, particularly the West and California. Through pieces about suburban murder, Las Vegas weddings, the counter-culture movement in the Haight-Ashbury of San Francisco, Sacramento's history, Communists, life in New York as a young woman, the Santa Ana winds, John Wayne, Hawaiian history, and personal reflections on herself, among others, Didion confesses a perspective of directness, dry humor, irony, and insight that trump immediate judgements and delve into a level of beauty that is poetic and modern.   None of her subjects is treated condescendingly, though the shock and disturbance of a mute but bright little kid, whose mother is dropping acid and probably far too young herself strikes Didion. As does the image of a young girl, maybe five, who is fed acid, and other drugs, by her juvenile mother. At the same times, in the essay about Hawaii, Didion doesn't shy away from showing a society ingrained with racism, where people become tourist products and exotic characters.   Didion analytically writes about morality, and respect, two issues that pervade her more journalistic writing, with an individualistic and logical feel, one that humanizes constantly, reminding that our own self analysis and judgements are inconsistent things, hardly enough for us to deny the awe of others.   So quicky Las Vegas weddings, diligent and unsuccessful Communists and pioneering drug abusers are not lent a foolishness or an evil. They are observed and presented, and written with the possibility of going one way or another.   Throughout Didion captures a time and many places, a mystery and a depth that expose the 1960's in America, and California for more than the sum of it's parts. Where the flower power/feminism movements are sometimes regarded as sweet revolutions, here they are infused with some less than glorious characteristics. And the paradise that is Hawaii, or Southern California are shown to be as troubled and dark as they are sunny and warm.   This is an essential read. Joan Didion is a terrific writer, capable of communicating clearly, but not her opinion, or a mere judgement. Her voice is subtle, and her quotes and dialogue are kept to a minimum, while her mind, works as a filter through which the varied subjects flow, exposing a deeper humanity.   The Modern Library version also features a history of Didion's writing, and an essay by Elizabeth Hardwicke about Slouching Towards Bethlehem.	2005-02-22

In comes the Soldier, and the War and the vile difference between two people feeling each other out while playing sexual politics, and someone beyond limits and feelings and hopes. <br />To say this is a shocking play is an understatement. It is very violent, sexual and disturbing. There is nudity, much alcohol/smoking, gun threats, rape, oral sex, torture, cannabalism, masturbation.... <br />And it's powerful.

Mrs. Carrie Watts' dream is to take a trip to Bountiful, where she was born and where life was happy for her, before death, before sickness and before Houston. In Houston she lives with her only child, Ludie, and his wife Jessie Mae, in a two room apartment.  <br />Mrs. Watts is so intent on taking that trip to Bountiful that she has tried, though unsuccessfully, several times before to get there, and get away from her daughter-in-law and son, who want nothing more than her monthly government check and assured safety at home, respectively.  <br />For anyone familiar with Horton Foote, the characters and time, the place and family circumstance are vintage. He writes about \\"little\\"/\\"regular\\"/\\"down home\\" people, that is, people whose lives and concerns are not worldly, nor philosophically or artistically shaped. Rather they operate day to day, intent on stability. Ludie has seen hard times, as has Mrs. Watts, while Jessie Mae is a demanding, unhappy woman, stuck with these two and not too thrilled about it.  <br />But the need for a return home, for the peace afforded by safety and the dependability of pension checks is challenged by the risk of achieving a dream. That is, of realizing an inner truth, no matter the consistent odds.  <br />What results is a fine lesson in the possibility of both safety and adventure, each enhancing the lives of the Watts family.	2005-02-16

This is a sweet book, featuring 20 short stories about Bhante Piyananda's experiences as a Sri Lankan Theravada monk in America. Specifically the tales take place in Los Angeles, where since the mid 70's he has headed a local temple.  <br />The stories he presents regard a variety of issues and circumstances that he finds himself in, or are brought to him by other Buddhists, many of whom have also immigrated to America. As well, he recounts experiences when his Buddhism attracted attention enough to inspire conversation, judgement, confidences. All the stories are morally driven, as Piyananda passes on the Buddha's words and feelings. <br />As a resident of L.A. this book seemed by the title an oasis, a peaceful perspective on a wacky, unrooted place. In fact, Los Angeles could be anywhere in America inside these stories.  What matters is the lovely heart and soul of Buddhism, shone through it's most disciplined, devoted monks. Whether dealing with marriage troubles, robbery, parent/child conflicts, gossip, wealth, cultural differences,  etc., Piyananda's compassion and love evoke the Buddha's and the beauty of their revolutionary religion and lifestyle.  <br />I recommend this as a sweet, easy read. For anyone interested in Buddhism this features a wide range of situations all addressed by Piyananda and Buddhist texts he draws from.	2005-01-31

It is very directly, simply written, and presents the world and life in clear, imaginative, spiritual forms.   Don Miguel Ruiz lays out the ancient Toltec \\"way of life, distinguished by the ready accessibility of happiness and love.\\"  He sites four agreements that must be made within the self, in order to be peace and love. The four agreements are: Be Impeccable With Your Word, Don't Take Anything Personally, Don't Make Assumptions and Always Do Your Best. Without reading the book, they alone offer a way of life. But to read the book is to have them enforced with the knowledge and images of why people choose to struggle instead of choosing to be happy.

One review, until now, is pathetic. This book, featuring two of the absurd, menacing, weighty master's early works is terrific.     The Caretaker, along with The Homecoming, The Birthday Party and Old Times is one of Pinter's best, ultimately important, works. It is in my opinion one of the great post-WWII English plays.     The Dumb Waiter, similar to The Caretaker in it's setting and brother-like characters, while being a long one-act, is creepier still and more enigmatic.    The Caretaker is about a vagabond named Davies, who is taken into a run-down room in a run-down house by Aston, who lives there, and collects things in it, and is the brother of Mick, who owns the building. Initially the relationship between Davies and Aston is kind, generous and progressive. Davies, used to trudging through life homeless is taken aback at the trust and goodwill offered by Aston. When Mick arrives later, Davies must feel out the differing attitude, as Mick looks after his brother, and isn't so easily trusting of the ragged and scruffy Davies. But eventually Aston seems odd (and delivers an amazing monologue testifying to his possible insanity), and Mick more level headed, and both at different times offer Davies a job in the house, as Caretaker.   But Pinter being Pinter, the goodwill is possibly unreal, or something else entirely. There is a vague confusion to the play, a lack of specifics, and the characters, in classic masculine style, only say what they think they need to, i.e.:              Davies: What do you do-? What do you do...when the bucket's full?       Pause.       Aston:  Empty it.       Pause.    Davies, somewhat boxed into the house by weather and possibility never knows his place, as the brothers, who rarely are in the room together, keep him off balance. The truth becomes elusive, as do the facts. One never knows one's place, or how each feels about the other. A scary moment comes when Davies, flustered by the erratic behavior of Aston, calls him \\"nutty\\" tohis brother, Mick. To which Mick replies: \\"You get a bit out of your depth sometimes, don't you?\\"    The Dumb Waiter is more absurd then The Caretaker. Two guys, possibly hitmen, possibly waiters, staying in a basement room, awaiting orders to do something, must contend with a dumb waiter that begins to descend with notes requesting food. The room clearly not a kitchen, and they not sure what is going on upstairs, instead put the little food they have in the dumb waiter, which ascends and descends several times. The trapped nature of Gus and Ben lends that Pinter menace to the story. Each has a gun, and seems ready to kill. But a lack of information, either known to them, or expressed by them so we know, keeps the lid on the proverbial pot.     These both are classic plays. I highly recommend this book.	2005-01-07

'night, Mother is a hell of a play. For a two person play, which takes place in real time, it is a moving decent into the demon world of two women, mother and daughter, co-dependents, best friends, enemies, like no other.     Jessie, the daughter is a woman deeply in pain, so much so that her capacity to live has gone, as has her capacity to love. Thelma is her mother, desperately clinging to the one person she loves, whom she needs more and more, and loses sight of more and more.     There were many sobs and sniffles in the audience towards the end of 'night, Mother, and though reading the script is different than seeing it performed by terrific actresses (Edie Falco as Jessie and Brenda Blethyn as Thelma), the story is good enough and in your face enough to do the job.     This is a play about when, if, why and how we stop being parents or kids, and start being our own people, or if that is even possible. Somewhat depressing, but serious and true.	2005-01-06

Princess, who is significantly older is so wrapped in her vanity and stardom, or there-lack-of, has latched onto Chance, because they are similar and desperate for what each other has.   Sweet Bird of Youth is not a nice play. These are people who are not likeable, nor funny, and their desperation almost defines them. I say almost, because they are also passionate and hopeful, even in round about ways. They are symbols of Time's heavy hand, extravegance, unfortunate fame, addicts, wayward souls.   Sweet Bird of Youth belongs in the second tier of Williams' plays. After Streetcar, Cat, Glass, and with The Rose Tattoo, Suddenly, Last Summer, and Orpheus Descending. Full of loud, troubled people on point of hysteria, whose sexual, or emotional hunger is suicidal and beyond reason. But lacking in broad connection to the world, in familial dynamics and struggle. In that way I recommend Sweet Bird of Youth for the Williams' lover or admirer, not someone who wants to know his best work.	2004-12-23

A wayward one at that too. But Kid Collins and Fay Anderson are star-crossed if there ever was a pair, and Thompson never lets you know, if or when they are ever alligned. Thompson keeps you guessing, about the plot between Uncle Bud, Fay and Kid, about who lives, who dies and why, and just what it is that Kid Collins has been running from for so long. Is he a mental case, or a first class con-man/actor bent on hell. There is a wonderful element of psychological chaos to Thompson's story, and it brought out of me a dimension of compassion and empathy, even as these people bang through life, toward doom.	2004-12-22

Books	3	5	5	N	N	The Corrupting Rush of Time	This is a good, not great Williams drama, about a woman named Serafina Delle Rose, a spirited, vivacious Sicilian immigrant living somewhere along the Gulf Coast. While she is stricken by a death early on in the play, it is her heart and soul which throughout the story is subject to her own mania. She is an insensed woman, in the stereotypical Italian thrust, full of big gestures and deep longing. Also a devout Catholic, her spiritually gut wrenching journey is tied very much into the Virgin Mary.  <br />Without dealing with what happens and why and who it happens to, this is very much a Williams play. A widowed woman, yearning for a life that is gone, sexually frustrated, emotionally wracked. There is also much symbolism, in particular Catholic symbolism, and spiritual superstition. Serafina's sexually blossoming daughter is where Serafina once was, and this provides for conflict, but the sub-plot here is not great, and the majority of the play is Serafina's wild twisting from love toward love, with the gamut in between. <br /> <br />\\"Snatching the eternal out of the desperately fleeting is the great magic trick of human existence.\\" So says Tennessee in a terrific short essay called The Timeless World Of A play, which opens the book.	2004-12-15

With an intensely ugly figure, distorted beyond all European notions of beauty, she was said to possess precisely the kind of shape which is most admired among her countrymen, the Hottentots.\\" <br /> <br />The awesome Suzan-Lori Parks here tells of Saartjie Baartman, a historical person, famous as The Venus Hottentot. Parks style reminds of vaudville. Very stylized, fluid in the movement of actors from one character to another, in the direct connection with the audience, in the passage of time and in the presentational aspect of her stories. Through her style the play feels like a carnival show, with boasting and huckster cries, something that would work on a medieval wagon stage. <br /> <br />Venus is about a young woman taken from her home where she was a servant in Africa in the early 1800's to England to be exploited as a sideshow freak/savage/heathen particularly because of her large butt. From there her fame and in some instances, fortunes grow until her death in 1810 in Paris.  <br /> <br />There is much in the way of historical referencing here, including what seem to be quotations from medical, literary and personal journals of the day. But it seems Parks created this, because no bibliographic references are made. This is all the more impressive then, because Parks' spot on medical language denotes an era and an attitude. While her dialogue which is written in a sort of simple, phonetic, colloqueal style flows easily from the uneducated Venus and those witnessing her life, from The Negro Resurrectionist and the Chorus, to the educated Baron Docteur, whose double fascination (medical/sexual) with her gets the better of him and the worse of her.  <br /> <br />Truly a tale of exploitation and manipulation, about the European maligning of Africans for humorous, medical, fashionable, financial and sexual means. Venus is a tragic figure, representative of the social abuse of Africans by Europeans, whose human qualities become gross examples of a sub-species, the basest form of life, medical oddities and for the Baron Docteur, then surprisingly powerful and moving.   <br /> <br />Writes Parks in her bio at the back of the play: \\"'Tell all the Truth but tell it slant,' as Emily Dickinson says. With Venus my angle is this: History, Memory, Dis-Memory, Remembering, Dismembering, Love, Distance, Time, a Show.\\"	2004-12-07

This is a very swift moving, lean play, which may be about ignorance, learning to pay attention to yourself, female subservience, psychopathic love or even the mental effect of poverty and absent family life on a young mind. The play is so efficient and flexible though that if I kept considering themes, several more are there. Because of that flixibility of theme, that encompasses many issues, The Glory of Living is an excellent play.     It reminded me of some of Sam Shepard's plays about poor, down and out, violent and seemingly foolish people. It also reminded me of Badlands, the 1973 film about the young, beautiful couple who murdered several people.     Another review here spoke of the simplicity with which Gilman deals with heavy subjects, allowing the audience or reader to contemplate and feel the issue out, so as to see the people involved and not be lead by spectacle and judgement. That is a point I'd say is right on, because by the end of the play I was moved by the tragedy of Lisa.     Carl: (shaking his head) I can't even begin to understand you.  Lisa: Yeah. But I appreciate that you try.	2004-11-30

Even in spite of mistakes, which are surely universal. That I suppose was behind Wasserstein's m.o., that tangling with the gossips and character assassins and the news engine is more gristle for them, death for you. That is a statement painfully necessary more and more, as the hypocrisy of the day is not slips of paper and frustrating civil service, but war and death and political capital.	2004-11-23

But I know it can be found in Faber & Faber compilations of Stoppard's work. And at libraries, where I took one out.<br /><br />This is a bit bizarre, even for Stoppard. The play is actually two plays, specifically Dogg's Hamlet, being the first act, and Cahoot's MacBeth the second. They are connected though.<br /><br />In what amounts to an experiment in theatrical language, and a sly investigation of meaning, perhaps against action, Stoppard gives characters who communicate in code. All their words are English, but re-configured. This allows for some coincidence and humor, as well as disjoint and frustration.<br /><br />Dogg is a school master directing a production of Hamlet. His few students play all the parts and help Easy, a lorry driver to build the set with appropriate pieces of wood. This is difficult and funny though, because words like \\"slab,\\" \\"plank,\\" \\"cube,\\" and \\"block,\\" mean \\"okay, \\"ready,\\" \\"thank you,\\" and \\"next,\\" respectively, to the students and Dogg. This is Dogg's language. Hence, Dogg's Hamlet. But the production of Hamlet is actually all Shakespeare, in amazingly edited form, followed by an even shorter encore.<br /><br />Cahoot's MacBeth is a production of MacBeth in a Czech living room by actors who have been banned and barred from acting by the state. (In a helpful introduction Stoppard says he was inspired by Czech actors he met, who after being banned from work, took to performing in private apartments.) Here again is a clipped production which swims along until the Inspector arrives and hilariously makes fun of everyone, including \\"theatre\\" itself, \\"...is it the National Academy of Dramatic Art, or, as we say down Mexico way, NADA?...\\" Eventually Easy reappears, still with wood in the lorry, delivering \\"Birnam Wood,\\" but speaking Dogg. Key to Dogg is that one doesn't learn it, one catches it. So the actors assume Dogg speak and soon are performing the fifth act of MacBeth in Dogg, much to that chagrinof the Inspector.<br /><br />This may be confusing. In reading it is too. Stoppard offers translations too of Dogg. At it's best though the Dogg speak is a political act in code, either special kids talk that is foreign to outsiders like Easy, or dissenting code that revolutionaries and artists can use to continue in the face of oppression. As usual Stoppard is incredibly inventive here. This would be tough to stage, but amazing to see if it were done with the detail and specificity it demands.	2004-11-19

Even as whites they have not be spared the indignity of the police state, the brutality of the Special Branch or the suspicion of comrades. As well, Steve, a black contemperary and an old friend who introduced Piet to the struggle has been harassed, punished and imprisoned for his part in seeking justice (or being at a party even) in defiance of the law.  <br />What becomes these three is moving stuff. The stuff of close-up sorrow and collective disillusionment, in the country, in the struggle to free it from it's hate, in friendships, and in people as a whole. From there each must seek a peace with life, and as such, a lesson from aloes. <br />I recommend A Lesson from Aloes as another of Athol Fugard's highly humane, difficult renderings of a place where the worst in humanity was law, and the best of humanity faced it for what it was. All his works are sure testaments to human beauty under the clouds of human evil, and this play is no different.	2004-11-17

Claudio in desperation begs his sister Isabella, a sister in the order of St. Claire, lobby on his behalf. This initial conflict pits Angelo's absolute letter of the law mentality against Isabella's incredible piety. All the while the Duke, who feigned venturing to Poland, observes and manipulates the proceedings as a Friar, as he gets an upclose account of how the law and his citizenry behave.  <br /> <br />Such is the basic story of Measure for Measure. And while there is, as with all Shakespeare, much about goverance, male/female relationships, hypocrisy and morality that resonates to this day, the play's proceeding and outcome leave \\"much to be desired.\\" Some hangups are: The Duke's overzealous, almost obsessive involvement in and with everyone, the famous question of Isabella's final reply (or there lack of), the disappearance of Angelo, Claudio, Julietta, and Mariana from stage activity, and the sub-plot of Pompey, Lucio, Elbow, et al is dry.   <br /> <br />Some themes are: state law vs. spiritual law, sexual mores, the \\"righteousness\\" of morality, hypocrisy and blackmail in government, the search for true fairness, and the sacrifice of the body vs. the sacrifice of the soul.  <br /> <br />To conclude, a quote from the Duke, Act 3.2.216-220: <br />\\"There is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure, but security enough to make fellow-ships accursed. Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news is old enough, yet it is every day's news.\\"	2004-11-17

All three are surprising in their evolution, as each involves a gradual revelation from the characters in confidence with their \\"audience.\\" The first piece, Iphigenia in Orem, is about a business man who confides in a stranger a terrible secret. This piece left me shocked and mining the logic of action and the susceptability one has to suggestion. The second piece, A Gaggle of Saints is a disturbing tale of a weekend trip to Manhatten by several Bostonians for a party, which culminates in a vile violent \\"night cap.\\" The third, Medea Redux is a heart breaking story of young woman's spun world, as she speaks into a recorder inside a mental institution/asylum.  <br />Each piece evokes the violence and sacrifice and desparation of Euripedes plays in a modern sense.

Certainly an homage from McNally to her, and for me a good introduction into her personality and place in theatre history. In a way this is a one-woman piece, with accompaniment, from student singers and a pianist, as Callas the character engages them and the audience in a ride on her spirit, in the guise of a Master Class. Because of the play I looked into Callas on the net and learned of her connection to Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy as well. This was new to me, and serves the play too, in trance like reminiscences where she speaks to Onassis and husband Battista Meneghini, as well as her audience(s).  <br /> <br />Master Class is a powerful theatre piece, full of simple yet difficult truths about performing and a life in the theatre, about artists and giving ones life, heart and soul to your craft. She gave us everything, and with a load of bitterness and a load of love she comes alive in the place that she made and the place that made her.	2004-11-13

Each of the sisters is stuck in some way, trapped by time in their mid-lives. They are joined at oldest sister Sara's London home by Sara's daughter, and several male suitors/friends.     Throughout Wasserstein keeps the tone light and the wit cracking. Everyone of these characters is intelligent and visible, knows the world yet remains perplexed by their own lives.     To me this is the type of affirming family bound play that warms, and though life remains elusive in many ways, the sisters know they have each other and use that love and charity to sweet degrees.

In each individual there is a struggle between the two, particularly Beatrice, the mother of Tillie (aka Matilda) and Ruth. The love and trauma of family is especially harsh because the effects are the deepest. In this play, about a mother and her two daughters, the spectre of family life is exposed as dangerous and hurtful, despite a natural inclination against such negativity. In that confusing place resides the plays sublime nature, where  youthful spiritual proclivity battles angst filled self hating adulthood.

This is an Irish play calling for two actors to play multiple parts. The main characters, Charlie and Jake are extras for an American film in County Kerry to shoot Quiet Valley, a rural Irish romance. In the course of the play the two actors are also Production Assistants, other extras, a couple local kids, the film's famous lead actress, and other characters. As an acting piece this would be both awe-enducing in it's complexity and thrilling in it's shifting of tone and character. The skill to perform this piece demands well worked out, detailed individualized characters. All the demands of an actor in a solo piece are here, only for two.  <br /> <br />The play itself is frequently funny, marked by a swift pace, moving toward a hopeful and unforeseen ending.

Howl is a brilliant imagining of a generation of souls careening through existence, full of action and movement. The famous opening line, \\"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked...\\" sets off a force of vivid description and incredible depth. Howl continues through the devious Moloch, to rest in Rockland where his love laid. A Supermarket in California is sweet understanding, peaceful and simple in public.

It started sideways and ended sadly.\\" <br /> <br />Victory Celebrations was a trial to read. The play is very wordy with confusing actions written in and many obscure references that only well learned and informed Russian scholars or students would be able to follow. Full of irony about Russian joy, and sarcastic banter about punishments at the hands of the Party and the Communist system, the play has too much in every way, and consequently no appeal or magnetism. <br /> <br />An interesting footnote is that Victory Celebrations was \\"composed orally while on gang labour\\" by Solzhenitsyn. This explains the ironic and sarcastic bombast of the officers, the occasional, seemingly delusional yet lucid speeches about hard hellish \\"real\\" life in Stalin's army and country.  <br /> <br />Those speeches, which illuminate the horror and doldrums of Communist Russia are the best part of Victory Celebrations. Coming from Solzhenitsyn such descriptions are apt and weighted. But the rest of the play was a bore. I was confused who was who, what was going on, and had less and less interest in finding out.  <br /> <br />I would figure this is ideal for Solzhenitsyn fans/students, and Russian theatre afficianados and the like.	2004-11-03

Or perhaps the play came after the Garbo film. I don't know.  <br />The story is about the contentious and lovely relationship between Ninotchka, a young Russian woman sent to Paris to reacquire Rembrandt paintings once in the possession of the Soviet Union. Her counterpart is Leon, a Parisian lawyer representing a former Russian princess who took the paintings with her when she fled Bolshevik Russia. Ninotchka and Leon hit it off, despite international intrigue and the threat of lost love or life. Three Russians originally sent to negotiate with Leon provide the clownish relief, as they contrast stark Communist demands on existence with the joy of hedonistic heavy Paris.  <br />Definitely a dated play, standard in it's structure, theatrical conceits and conclusion.	2004-11-02

I know of his genre/style, and have seen the film of Devil in a Blue Dress. This though seemed a departure, at least from my expectations.     The opening short story Smoke is more L.A. sleuth/heavy Easy as he searches out a school bomber. Smoke seems to be more like the Mosely I'd heard of than the main piece, Gone Fishin'. Smoke is a serial piece, continued into Six Easy Pieces. It ended with my curiosity peaked....    Gone Fishin' is a character study of both Easy and Mouse, as they drive into Southeast Texas to seek money for Mouse's upcoming wedding to EttaMae. This story is incredibly written. The dialect/colloquealism'd language gives much to the charaters and the setting. As well, Mosely paints Mouse as the \\"funny-man\\" to Easy's \\"straight-man,\\" in that Mouse's actions lead Easy to response, and truly progress the action. But Easy, being the conscience of the piece is fascinated by Mouse, haunted by dreams and visions and leads us through an eye opening experience in through late 30's south Texas. Throughout the story Easy is in one form of disorientation after another, overcome by the country people he encounters, realizing along the way that he is at a pivitol time in his life. I suppose that Gone Fishin' too is a serial piece, a prequel though to Easy and Mouse's later adventures.     I left Gone Fishin' liking Easy, sympathizing with his way in the world, and curious to read about his war experience, how he gets to California, as well as what becomes of Mouse and EttaMae.	2004-10-29

I liked The Wash because it simply states the complex and painful results of a marriage.  <br />Nobu and Masi are newly separated after 40 plus years together. They are in new territory though still attached, as Masi keeps washing Nobu's clothes even 13 months after separating. Clearly they are tied into each other, but how much is love and affection and how much is tradition and familiarity?  <br />This is a terrific \\"little\\" play about a family, not requiring much to produce. Occasionally beautiful, poignant and funny. Also a play about the advent of modern adaptation. Some beautiful Japanese lullabys too.	2004-10-29

Anti-macho nonsense, anti-abuse, anti-syncophant, anti-war mongering, anti-violence, anti-abandonment. All the \\"living\\" characters in it are trying to be someone else....except Harold, who is so much himself (or forgone) that his personality is deadly against the others.  <br /> <br />This is a very funny, bizarre, timely play. Now, as America is back in a questionable war, as we were when this was written in 1970, and blatant aggression is somehow acceptable here is Vonnegut standing up to show us all how ridiculous we are, and ridiculous just about everyone in the play is.  <br /> <br />Harold is single-minded and aggressive enough to not see its effect on others. Penelope, who is lost throughout most of it, is stuck and needs the borishness of Harold to see the error of her ways. Woodly is patently lost in a field of peace, joy and positivity full of rage, but smitten by the myth of manliness. Shuttle is an idol worshiper and caught in an Americana sport/brotherhood fetish. Looseleaf is in a haze of wonder and awe at his past, shocked by his own inhumanity. Paul is angry, needy for a father, but protective like a fatherless child is of his mother. The three \\"ghosts\\" are ironic and a hope for us all. Since this world is ridiculous and stupid, belief that the next one is anything but remains a peaceful possibility. <br /> <br />A good play, full of social commentary, Vonnegut's wit and black humor. Recommended, especially in this day in age, and for Vonnegut fans.	2004-10-28

Books	4	1	1	N	N	Apartheid's Lethal Breath Exposed	Here is a painful play about the hope of a country and it's people falling by the wayside under the mad rush of anger and rage and frustration. <br /> <br />There are only three characters here: Mr. M, a black teacher in Brakwater, called \\"the location,\\" the black town outside the white town of Camdeboo. Thami, also black, is a leading young student, and protege of Mr. M. And Isabel, a white girl Thami's age, who befriends both of them after an interschool debate.  <br /> <br />Together the three of them agree to prepare for a competition which may represent the best and brightest of a new generation of South Africans. One that is marked by a union between blacks and whites, in the spirit of education, knowledge and words. Such is the hope. But the hope ultimately gives way to the heart wrenching evil of apartheid as it cuts the three apart. Mr. M and Thami diverge about how to fight apartheid and Isabel struggles as her new friendships crack, and spirits wane. <br /> <br />Painful. Spiritually uplifting, then crushing. Eye opening.	2004-10-26

Without giving away key plot points, I'll recommend this book right off the bat. Here is Vonnegut, yes if you can believe it, decrying the state of humanity, witfully and ironically too. There is a given moral sense to Mother Night, which Vonnegut states in the Introduction: \\"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful what we pretend to be.\\"  And Mother Night is a story of how Howard W. Campbell, Jr. and his associates must and do and will deal with said moral.   Mother Night is quite moving, in the way that so much Vonnegut is; in that here is a hero or anti-hero, a lead if you will, who is shaped rather than shapes his or her time. And how that shaping baffles, sparkles, crushes, devoures, stimulates and paralyzes.   Given an opportunity to be someone else, and taken to the fullest, for a good cause (or not), where are you then? You only have yourself....in the end....to blame....  Again, highly recommended.	2004-10-25

This is not an uplifting account of men and women working successfully together. No, this is an angry, rapid two hander about a forty someting professor (John) and a twenty year old female student of his (Carol).  <br />What comes about is unclear intentions, challenges to social paradigms of teach/student relations, failed attempts at understanding, insane real estate battles, condescention, feminine warrior martyrdom, overt or covert personal strikes, intellectual agrandizement, life altering accusations, political struggle and humiliations. All before an ultimate destruction.  <br />Sound ridiculous? In a way it is. It is also believeable and scary.  <br />Definitely a good piece for discussion between men and women.

Interspersed with Shakespeare's words, and Smith's experiences sharing them with New York City's oldest people, as well as his experience with Shakespeare on stage is a pained and moving life. <br />This is a remarkable book for anyone who identifies with the social/communal feel of life in the theatre, or artists for that matter. As well, anybody who knows the outside of an easy going life, alienation, deep guilt, a stilted family life, and the strain and sublime beauty of mental retardation. <br />I feel thankful after reading this. Smith illuminates the simple beauty of a daily train ride into the city, the warmth and intensity of being an off stage dresser, the joy of being with young actors and artists, and the sweetness of giving to older folks, and finding out that they need vitality and art as much as anyone. Great for actors and theatre lovers!	2004-10-21
US	31898244	R3E7HBZWUBXY8B	0822200309	596465988	The American Dream, The Death of Bessie Smith, and Fam and Yam.	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Three from Albee.	Here is the long one-act The American Dream, another one-act in The Death of Bessie Smith and a short, short mock interview/scene called Fam and Yam.  <br />If you are into Albee and have read his more widely known works, this is for you. As far as I know The American Dream is pretty well known, and can also be found in a book with The Zoo Story.  <br />Written in 1960-61, The American Dream is a semi-absurd sort of dumb show about a married couple who go by Mommy and Daddy, the mother of Mommy who is called Grandma, a women who shows up called Mrs. Barker and eventually a Young Man, ostensibly the adopted son of Mommy and Daddy. The message and feel of The American Dream is overt: comfortable 1950's home life, concerned with clothes and well paid for satisfaction was/is all a show. Each part of the simple American family played a part, all despite any personality. Here, for example Grandma is the clown/fool/ironic sensibility of the piece, as she bickers with Mommy and Daddy and knows all too well the plight of old people, despite or in spite of her advanced knowledge and experience. Without giving away much more, The American Dream is an acidic piece, seemingly very autobiographical, Albee having been adopted, and a slight at the values and mores of a generation.  <br />The Death of Bessie Smith is a disturbing, but surely more realistic slap dash into 1937 Memphis, race relations and female/male battles. Bessie Smith is a backround figure, as an accident involving her and her boyfriend/manager brings them into a whites-only hospital and an iron hearted nurse who laserates the e.r. intern who is in love with her. He's the liberal loving doctor, she's the bitter cold witch... <br />The triangle between the black characters, including an orderly who straddles the segregation line, the nurse and the intern exhibits overlapping sexual and racial status of the day. Not very funny, as The American Dream occasionally is, but heavy and stark.  <br />Fam and Yam is a shortscene between Fam(Famous American Playwright) and Yam(Young American Playwright). When I first read it I saw Albee as the Fam, tricked into saying something critical against the system of \\"villains\\" representing the structure of the theatre. But the short was written in 1960, just as Albee was on the rise, clearly the Yam and successful thus is baiting and switching the establishment...I suppose it can be taken either way now.  <br />All three pieces are critical in themselves. Critical of the accepted social places of the American family, critical of the accepted social places of races, and critical of the establishment in theatre.	2004-10-20

Maybe because I went to Catholic schools? But I can see why many people did and still do. This is a true classic, concerning a gigantic human and national issue, one which well defines America still. <br /> <br />Based on the Scopes Monkey Trial, this is a spectacular drama, full of people from the town of Hillsboro (a fictional setting) and outsiders, converging to witness the trial of a man who dared to teach or suggest Darwinian evolutionary theory, and the two lawyers who argue for the law of God (and here the law of the state) and the laws of Science, respectively.  <br /> <br />This is an important, positive play because it is about choice. I wish I could have been part of a class discussion of the play, and to see how other people, especially kids take this story.  <br /> <br />I read the Dramatists Play Service edition, which features extensive stage directions that take up equal space to the dialogue itself. The scope of the production is evident, with about 30 speaking parts and dozens of other bystandards. For this reason I wonder if another edition is less extensive... <br /> <br />But the stage directions can be skimmed, and if you are reading for the heart if it, they should be. The heart being the trial scenes themselves, particularly when defence attorney Henry Drummond cross examines his counterpart Matt Brady, an avowed Biblical expert. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. The kind of play and story I'd like to re-read once a year...	2004-10-15

Willing to expose s--t and anguish and self-loathing and nostaglia and laugh about it. This play is very direct, interesting, full of mortal longing presented though an amazingly simple concept. The three tall women, A, B and C are one woman. But at three different times in their own life. What comes is a moving sweep of life, as thought through in the future by C, the past and future by B and the past by A. What would you ask yourself if you met you twenty-five or sixty years from now? What would you say to yourself knowing what you know now to you thirty years ago? Etc., etc. There is no denying, the concept and idea of such a dialogue is ancient, and here Albee contemparizes it in the bittersweet way that life is. Read this if you love Albee, if your into philosophy, time travel, theoretical physics, feminism....There is no denying.	2004-10-13

But nobody here listens to what anybody says. So say members of the Rice family several times. This play, while not about the Angry Young Man generation of Look Back in Anger, is about the same era, and the disillusionment of the same class. Archie Rice is, like his father Billy was, a showman in local music halls. But the popularity of the music hall is going to the dogs and nobody seems to care, not even Archie.<br /><br />The Rice family lives together, Grandpa Billy, son Archie, Archie's wife Pheobe, and Archie and Pheobe's son Frank. Then Archie's daughter Jean shows up. What becomes is underlying and expressed tension that reminded me at times of Pinter's The Homecoming. Snipping and age old feuds present themselves as Jean, surprisingly home from London realizes how stuck and angry and numb her family is and has been. She is the Angry Young Woman, who senses her frustration and wants to do something about it.<br /><br />This is an aged English play, with references and slang that were at times obstacles to a twenty-something in LA. But Osborne powerfully writes the Rice family, layering indignation and memory and hardships of being lower class in England in the late 50's. Archie, who straddles the world of the family and the music hall is that hopelessly driven entertainer, senseless to his schtick's long ago death, hamming it up all the way through the s--t of life. And still Jean, who is the true vibrancy of the play is left with: \\"Here we are, we're alone in the universe, there's no God, it just seems that it all began by something as simple as sunlight striking a piece of rock. And here we are. We've only got ourselves. Somehow, we've just got to make a go of it. We've only ourselves.\\"	2004-10-11

The lessons are in the form of dialogues/conversations between teacher and student.  <br /> <br />The lessons are: Concentration, Memory of Emotion, Dramatic Action, Characterization, Observation and Rhythm.  <br /> <br />This is a very basic yet infinitely deep series on the tools that an actor needs, which Boleslavsky draws out of his pupil, here called The Creature. The antiquated nature of the relationship seems of the time, 1933, and though that may distract from the substance, it rapidly becomes as much a device as the dialogue/conversation format used to express the lessons. <br /> <br />I could pick this up and open to any lesson and mine that for a time.

Great dialogue/speeches, intense relationships and characters, sibling rivalry (as metaphor for embracing one's history or using it to build towards something new), and a suspenseful essence. This is a definitive classic for its depth and symbolism. The inexplicable need to excercise a tortured past and move hopefully with the present toward the future.     The Piano Lesson is a vivid experience of the irony that a drunken Wining Boy speaks of upon coming back to his neice Berneice's house: (to paraphrase) at the bar strangers treated me like family and at home my family treats me like stangers.     Very deep and ultimately satisfying.	2004-10-01

That said, this is an excellent collection. Energetically all of Zinn's writings stem against the massive tides of bureaucracy, imperialism, racism, big business, atrocities, irony, patriotism and militarism. He adeptly argues against the hypocricy of the past and the present in what I felt to be anticipation of a truly just future. His ultimate point being the need \\"to achieve justice, with struggle, but without war.\\"    Most the writings are concerned with World War II and Vietnam, be it policies, battles or each wars place in history. WWI, Korea, Gulf War I, Kosovo and Yugolsalvia are also written about. As well, modern politics is engaged throughout and then illuminated in the final chapter, titled Beyond Machiavellianism which includes two expansive and frightening essays on U.S. Foreign Policy and the notion of a \\"just war\\" versus and \\"unjust war.\\"     This is a call to common sense, pacifism and equality. Zinn presents all of his arguments against a morality that speaks to accountability, responsibility, hope, truths and the imperative of the citizenry to inform themselves and not senselessly accept our leadership's habits or predelictions.     A good introduction to Zinn.	2004-09-27

After finishing this play, where a family moves from one death through to another, while hearts and spirits are broken or manipulated, the presence of evil does lurk. There is an element of greed which permeates The Secret Rapture, which may be simplified as the downward spiral of one woman, whose spirit and heart are piece by piece removed by her closed people.<br /><br />I liked this because Hare writes women characters wondefully, and the heroine, named Isobel is a sesnitive soul inundated by the mood of the day. Almost helplessly she sees her world up-turned, not sure if it is meant to be or she's simply passive and afraid.<br /><br />Hare also creates in the characters of Marion, Isobel's sister, and Tom, Marion's husband, two genuinely deceptive or deceived people. Marion is scary, and Tom is somewhat limp, loving Jesus throughout much of the play. They represent the powerful and power hungry and the righteous, respectively. There are several scenes when I wanted Isobel to lash out furiously at Marion, who arrogantly advances through the world, unmoved by those troubled by it.<br /><br />This is a heavy play. One that sets damage at the forefront and features people who break and are unbreakable.	2004-09-25

This began as a radio play in the early 70's and was adapted to the stage in the late 80's. The story is terrific.  <br /> <br />The play is structured moving back in time from 1972 to 1914 and then forward again from 1914 to 1972. It concerns three artists who have shared their lives together, including apartments and studios and the affections for one woman.   <br /> <br />The play is funny, witty like so much of Stoppard, absurd and in concluding a bit sad. I would love to see this performed and recommend it as a read too. <br /> <br />If this was to be produced on stage I would say there are some complex technical necessities. Perfectly timed looping tape recorder and removeable balastrade/railing being the most central. If done well, as written, this would be a splendid show.	2004-09-24

Full of humor, existential spinning, quantum leaps, horror, absurdity and other life defining delirium. A favorite passage is from page 76:<br /><br />Billy licked his lips, thought a while, inquired at last: \\"Why me?\\"<br /><br />\\"That is a very Earthling question to ask, Mr. Pilgrim. Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything? Because this moment simply is. Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber?\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes.\\" Billy, in fact had a paperweight in his office which was a blob of polished amber with three lady-bugs embedded in it.<br /><br />\\"Well, here we are Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.<br /><br />This is a book that can be read quickly and frequently. The writing is easy and to the point. The imagery is active too. Passing from different times in time, from an office in 1967 to a hospital in a POW camp in 1944 for example, all I had to hold me in place was Billy Pilgrim. Pilgrim is the fortunate or unfortunate, I suppose there could be an argument either way, hero of the novel. Slashed at by existence and spun into a universal adventure that gives him two \\"wives,\\" three children, lots of dead friends, a sense of peace amidst the most heinous and hilarious circumstances, and synchronicity with himself through time and space, among other things, that moved me with its elemental truth. So it goes. So it goes.<br /><br />I hope that this book is read and read over and over, especially by school kids, who have English teachers who keep seeing this on lists of \\"challenged\\" books. I think there is an attitude similar to the scenes toward the end of the book when Pilgrim shares and hospital room with Rumfoord, historian of the Air Force. Rumfoord sees Pilgrim as a moron, and despite Pilgrim's eventual admission that he was in Dresden during the firebombing, to Rumfoord he still has no understanding of what war is. Such is Vonnegut to so many \\"patriots\\" and die-hard industrialists who perpetuate advocacy for such horrors. So it goes.<br /><br />This is a book that brings out many emotions, and evokes a sense of experience that has no apparent reasoning. A true classic.	2004-09-21

Becker and Booster, estranged father and son have a scene, which shoots out into hearty emotional territory from the get, that is the heart of this play. A destinctly male play, featuring some standard types, the core being: young & ambitious Youngblood, pesky instrusive Turnbo, older drunken Fielding, settled/sedate veteran Doub, father/manager/coach-like Becker, and Booster-who is actually a mix of youthful intentions and elder understanding.<br /><br />  I read this and cared for Becker and Booster. I was hopeful for Youngblood, and was held in suspense about what would happen between Turnbo and Youngblood.<br /><br />  Jitney is a positive play, with a surely hopeful attitude and a redemptive feel. Wilson deals sparingly with outside circumstances: impending eviction/unknown future, alcoholism/senseless violence, black & white relations, lies that can be tolerated and truths that can't, community/family outside of blood, etc.<br /><br />  I did think it ended too easily, but maintained a sense of hopefulness and redemption, that I imagined satisfied the on-going life of the characters.	2004-09-15

The story is about two giants of their time, who turn on each other through folly and necessity. That mythological study alone makes this good. Add onto it the scope of a king and an archbishop, a man looking for advise and power and another looking for a purpose in life. Anouilh's stage directions also add an excellent imagery to the story, stark and minimal that evokes an emphasis on the relationships between Henry and Becket. This is a great companion to The Lion in Winter and A Man for All Seasons. From an actor's point of view both leads are attractive, one being furious and physical and the other an internal ball of conflict and spiritual discovery.	2004-09-13

Both were surprising to me, particularly Reckless, which tied itself up in an emotionally and symbolically moving way. Blue Window is a very lyrical play. The juggling that Lucas did to write it is impressive in reading it, and the performance of the piece-where actors must time the simulateous speeches and cues from each other-would be very engaging and swift, were it done as it must be.<br /><br />I liked Reckless better though. I think it's quirkier, funnier and uses images and styles of expression in a more theatrically thrilling way.<br /><br />Blue Window had a Big Chill feel-\\"the party\\" being the device of a gathering. These characters are not old friends though. It is  a gathering of contemporaries and an ensuing discovery that each remains an individual no matter what company they keep. There is within it an infinite philisophy and spiritual depth as each character urges toward transcendence. Reading Blue Window is very much different than seeing it would be. Upon a stage the seeming jumble of activity and speech clarifies itself as actors embody each character. As a read there is alot of juggling which morphed much of the personality traits into a kind of collective character essence.<br /><br />I recommend them both, and must praise Lucas for two plays that offer what I know would be terrific theatre experiences, as they offer terrific reading.	2004-09-09

There is a clear and strong relationship between the two brothers, which would make playing each both fun and interesting. Their characters are drawn distinctly of each other enough to leave room for their similarities and dependecy and have it make sense. As a read I wanted to know where it would go, which is a good sign, and can imagine on stage the possibile dynamism of the text. I was moved by the play's conclusion and the evolution of the characters. In a way Orphans would make a good sibling/companion to True West, both featuring the trauma of brotherhood relationships coming to a head. Energetic, violent, subtle, poignant, frightened, hopeful.	2004-09-08

Singular in character....There are many terrific stories here. Stories of abuse, childhood revery, the pangs of despised love, an immigrants song, notions of patricide, old Denver, old LA....I enjoyed the youthful attitude Fante gave me of his Catholic schooling. I loved the heart break of 'A Wife for Dino Rossi', 'The Dreamer,' and the final story 'Helen,...' Did I write I liked the heart break? I was moved by it. There are awe-shucks nuns, brutal fathers, multi-cultural football teams, crazy death rites/funerals, in essence a harshness that never seems to disengage it's realtionship with beauty. I look forward to more Fante.	2004-09-07

For a sweetly essential read this is a must. Profiling people like Muhammed Ali, Floyd Patterson, Joe DiMaggio, Peter O'Toole, Sinatra and his own grandfather, Talese unites the journalistic style he even writes about, with an attractive fiction-like narrative. I looked forward to reading this each time, and was captivated by the non-sequitor poetics of Mr. Talese. Highly recommended for being simple, active and care-full about it's subjects.	2004-09-07

I guess the argument that some on the site regard this as a filmography holds true. Still there is certainly a biographical element laced throughout. But the hearty middle is about the films, and there were many of them, with a rundown of who was involved, where, the story/character, and then the goings on during the filming. Lots of drinking. Lots of humping mostly unknown females, lots of brawls and messin'. There are plenty of first hand accounts of Mitchum's kindness and generosity and many also of his nastiness and callousness. So he was moody? So. I will say an element is missing though. His family must not have supported this because there is relatively little from them, so Lee Server fills in the rest. I do wonder at his wife's putting up with what must have amounted to hundreds of affairs/liasons, and a seeming lack of argument. But there it goes...Who knows what makes a marriage, and after all I've just read an account of a busy and active and influential and rich life, but I'll never know the marrow, and apparently Mitchum's friends didn't even know such depths. I now appreciate him, will look out for his films more then ever, and marvel at some peoples appetite for drinks, brawls, affairs and cigarettes. To conclude, Mitchum is portayed here as a guy who I'd look forward to chatting with...	2004-09-05

There is much in the way of stark grotesqueness here, images of putressence, grief and shame. There is to be contrasted an ecstatic flip, light upon light, the searching amongst the cess for the soul of the saint. Cohen is a favorite song writer of mine, and I reside in favor of Hallelujah and Famous Blue Rain Coat quite often. But here, in Beautiful Losers, is a crabbing, scrapping, scratching of the fungal sore that results in grace. Grace full. Sexually debauching, with much talk of \\"pining\\" and \\"mining,\\" with long winded image upon image upon image, manipulation of the soul, double-crossing-best-friend-slash-lover-slash-mentor-slash-glorious alter ego, all leaving me with wonderment at how much there is to being....Not to mention the Candian history and Catherine Tekakwitha, the narrator's muse, she being Catholicism's first Indigenous Canadian adherent, or the modern Montreal surrounding the enrapturing apartment where the narrator dwells...Recommending Beautiful Losers, I am....and this: \\"Let it be our skill to create lengends out of the disposition of the stars, but let it be our glory to forget the legends and watch the night emptily.\\"	2004-08-06
