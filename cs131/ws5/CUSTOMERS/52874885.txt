Many times, when we study early American settlement, we can't really imagine what it's like to come to an untamed wilderness with primitive homes and few neighbors. When I read this book, the whole 17th century colony of Connecticut came alive. I experienced everything as the main character, Kit, did. She experienced many struggles and tribulations, trying to adjust to such a strict settlement, while still missing her home. She experiences romance, hard labor and a gripping witch trial. This is truly one of the greatest children's novels I have read.	2001-08-01

I enjoyed the Sweet Valley Twins books in elementary school. They showed the eventful lives of two middle-school girls growing up in a nice little town. In this story, Jessica, Elizabeth and their pal, Ken, start a dog-sitting business to earn money. I love the descriptions of Jessica and Elizabeth begging for customers and all the hard work they do to to make sure the dogs are taken care of. However, the twins and Ken receive a dog to watch named Joe. Joe is a beautiful white dog, but he has been abused. Jessica, Elizabeth and Ken now have to choose what to do: call the authorities and report the abusive owner, or keep their mouths shut and collect the money. I love how they handle the situation. This book is probably the most realistic of the Sweet Valley Twins books. The girls and Ken worked hard for their money, and I admired that. It is so good!

Eventually, though, with the help of her friends, Mary discovers her life isn't so bad after all. I enjoyed this book a lot. After Mary was so sad and depressed, she found some happiness.

In the story, Danny Jackson, a new boy at school, behaves really badly--playing pranks on people and acting up in class. Sure enough, instead of just thinking he's a bad kid, Elizabeth discovers he has trouble reading.

This backfires, however, and Elizabeth gets stuck with all of Jessica's problems. This story is very unrealistic. I don't know anyone who gets so pumped up over April Fool's Day.

It's about a new girl, Nora, who moves to Sweet Valley from Pennsylvania. The new kids tease her and make her feel unwelcome. I didn't like how mean they were to her. For example, a popular girl, Lila, stole Nora's homework and claimed it was her own; Lila framed Nora to make it appear she was stealing; several boys planned to vandalize Nora's home on Halloween... etc. I wish Nora had actually stood up for herself, instead of taking the rudeness. However, all is happy in the end because the kids at school eventually discover that Nora is a normal person like anyone else.

In Sweet Valley, everything is perfect, and all 6th graders are mature enough to handle dating. The story is pretty fun to read. Jessica &quot;meets&quot; someone through the dating service, and falls madly in love with him. However, she finds out the person she &quot;met&quot; was not who she expected. While it is very predictable who that &quot;someone&quot; is, it's still a fun and romantic book. You should go ahead and give it a try!	2000-12-16

There are very few books that focus realistically on boys, and I like the way this one does. In the story, Todd Wilkins is experiencing a lot of pressure from his father. Todd is in a writing class, and he's discovering his love of writing. But his father wants Todd to focus on basketball. Todd has too much pressure and he considers running away. I really like the way that Todd finds happiness even after his struggles. It's a very worthwhile book, and it shows the importance of being a good friend.	2000-12-16

I've enjoyed it for a long time. It's too bad that these books are now going out of print! This book is not one of the best ones in the series, though. In this story, Jessica sneaks out to see Johnny Buck, her favorite rock star. I just don't think it's very realistic. Jessica honestly believed Johnny Buck remembered her from the third row of concert a few years back? That was hard to swallow. I didn't like how selfish and immature Jessica acted. But it's a fun story as usual and I recommend giving it a try.	2000-12-16

I loved the Sweet Valley Twins series in elementary school. The books were always so fun to read. This story, however, I really didn't like. It wasn't very intriguing, and it feels like there are several other books in the series that are too similar. In this story, Ginny Lu Culpepper comes from the Appalatians to Sweet Valley. Her different ways lead to her being harrasssed by the popular girls and feeling left out. I didn't like how the popular girls treated Ginny Lu, and I really didn't like Ginny Lu's character. She was too much of a stereotypical hick like on the &quot;Beverly Hillbillies.&quot; I thought this book was one of worst in the series. If you are considering buying a Sweet Valley Twins book, try another one, because there are so many better than this one.	2000-12-16

This is not one of the best Sweet Valley Twins books, namely because of the sisters' interaction with one another. Jessica and Elizabeth are taking ballet classes together, and the big performance is coming up. Elizabeth has a huge part, while Jessica got a small part. Jessica whines and complains like a little child because she didn't make the lead. Finally, after trying to manipulate her sister, and take the easy way out, Elizabeth naively lets her sister play her part. As much as I like the Sweet Valley Twins books, this is not the best one and the sisters' interaction is unrealistic.<br />PS--To all you people who wrote a review about a girl named Nancy, you are thinking of a different book that has the same name.

In this story, Jessica and Elizabeth learn an artificial code language called &quot;ithig.&quot; They promise to keep it a secret and not teach it to anyone, but they eventually bend and teach the whole school. Now the whole school knows the &quot;ithig&quot; language, and they plan to play a trick on a new teacher. And as always, Elizabeth comes to the rescue. I think it's a fun book to read, but it's not one of the best in the Sweet Valley Twins series. The story isn't very realistic, and the kids seem to catch on to the new language much too quickly. But it's fun, so I'll give it 3 stars.	2000-12-16

Jessica joins the &quot;popular&quot; crowd, the Unicorns, while Elizabeth learns to express her creativity by joining the school newspaper.

I loved the Sweet Valley Twins series in elementary school. The books were always so fun to read. This story is rather strange for several reasons. 1) this story is never again referred to in other books. Usually, the twins or the author refers to past events, and this made no impact on the twins' lives. 2) The character of George never really comes back into the stories. But anyway, it's really a good story. Jessica and Elizabeth are on opposite teams for making the best time capsule in Sweet Valley Middle School. There are several items they both want, and the competition gets very fierce. Meanwhile, they help their friend George patch up his relationship with his father. It's a sweet little story and it's fun to read. It's not the all-time best in the series, and in fact, it's rather mushy when George's father makes a public apology to his son. But, hey, give this book a try.	2000-12-16

They give her a makeover, and magically overnight, she becomes the queen of popularity. I don't think it's very realistic that Sandra suddenly became so popular now that she was pretty.

I just really did not like this one. Something happened to J.K. Rowling's writing style that completely disenchanted me. Harry seemed so vain and self-centered. He constantly bragged about defeating Lord Voldemort (purposely repeating Voldemort's name to shock everyone) and how big and macho he was. He wasn't afraid of Sirius Black and he was going to go looking for trouble to show how big and bold he was. What happened to the sweet and caring Harry? I was very disappointed with Harry's character. In addition, the plot took forever to unfold. It was only around Page 200 that I got interested. That's not good. I don't enjoy reading through so much before it leads anywhere. However, the last 100 pages were excellent, and Rowling picked up the speed. I was left in suspense at the end. I wouldn't recommend this book to a friend, because of Harry's personality and because it takes so slowly to unwravel, but it has an enjoyable ending.	2000-12-15

Leah is the typical helpless lead, weeping and swooning in the tan muscular arms of her macho Devon. Without meaning to be, the drama of this book is extremely comical because it is clichd and fatuous. My two friends and I read this aloud to each other over the summer, and we rolled on the floor laughing. If you want a serious romance, I would not recommend this.

Or  psychology. Or literature.  No, there isn't a single President, governor,  or elected dogcatcher before or after All The King's Men to whom this story  is not relevant.  Nor is there a single preacher, lawyer, farmer, or  skidrow bum to whom it lacks relevance.  Jack Burden and Willie Stark are  Everyman in two persons.  The most careless reader of this novel will  understand that.  The relevance to President Clinton is the same as it is  to Richard Nixon, Richard Burton, Ronald Reagan, and Ronald McDonald.<br />Now  that these folks have read All the King's Men, I would suggest trying All  the President's Men.

He leaves the obvious judgmental conclusion  to the reader.  Malachy is fully aware of the nature and quality of his  acts.  All he has left out is a statement that he did morally bad things,  but only the more literal folks would need that.<br />The reader has to take  the story seriously, but understand the tone is self-deprecating.
