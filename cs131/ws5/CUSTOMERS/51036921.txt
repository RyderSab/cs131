I was really looking forward to reading this book as it was a two-in-one for me. I find the Middle Eastern culture fascinating, and I love biographies.<br /><br />In short, born in America in 1951 as Lisa Halaby, Queen Noor came from a well-connected, wealthy family and she was part of the first class of women attending Princeton University. Lisa meets the King through her father whom works in aviation. After a very short courtship (weeks rather than months), Lisa marries King Hussein, 15 years her senior.<br /><br />In \\"A Leap of Faith\\" Queen Noor speak of the obstacles she faced as a naive young bride, how she had to adjust to a loss of privacy, palace life, new faith, the resistance from Hussein's children from previous marriages, and the struggle to create a role for herself in a society where the only expectation was that she would keep the King happy.<br /><br />I find Queen Noor's story very interesting, so it is a shame that she does not \\"open up\\" more in this book. I would have liked the book to include more detail on her personal life.<br />I never got the feeling that I \\"knew\\" her, got a sense of who she is, which is usually what I feel when I read a biography, be it biographies over Malcolm X, President Carter, Hillary Clinton - to name a few.<br /><br />This book was quite different from what I expected. I expected to read about Queen Noor, instead I got more than a fair share of politics, stories about the Kings, and the history of Jordan. The Middle East fascinates me, and I have read a few books on the topic. Althought I am no expert, I cannot help but feel that her views expressed in this book on the Middle East, conflicts, who's to blame or not etc are biased and one-sided.<br /><br />It's an enjoyable read, but I wouldn't call it Queen Noor's biography. Like one reader said \\"If it wasn't for the picture of her on the cover, one could mistake this for being the King's memoirs.	2005-02-17

A dear friend gave me Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" for Christmas last year. He said it was such an interesting read, and was sure I would love it. I started reading the book Thursday morning on the train, got completely hooked after a few pages, and finished it in a few long sittings over the weekend.<br /><br />In short, the protagonist Robert Langdon, Harvard symbologist, is in Paris for work. Late one night at the hotel, he receives a phone call. It is the police, informing him that Monsieur Jacques Sauniere, the curator of the Louvre Museum have been murdered. Monsieur Sauniere was murdered inside the museum, and before he died, he left a bizarre, coded message. Robert Landon and a young female French cryptologist, Madame Sophie Neveu, have been called to the crime scene to assist the police.... of course, everyone involved have skeletons in the closet, nothing is as it seems to be, but I'll leave it there, so I don't spoil the fun for you.<br /><br />\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is not great writing. No one will use the same superlatives for Brown's prose as they would use for Hemingway's. Further, Brown may have presented historical events in this book as facts when it is fiction, and some of the facts presented are just plain incorrect. Anyway, all this is really beside the point ! It doesn't matter....<br /><br />The one thing you cannot challenge is that \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is hugely entertaining ! This was a great, riveting story.  I loved it ! I highly recommend it !!<br /><br />On a personal note, I have the stunning Collector's edition. It is a beautiful, beautiful book. It makes the reading much more interesting as you have great pictures of all the buildings, places, people, and the magnificent paintings mentioned in the book. If you can afford it, buy the illustrated version !<br /><br />PS. My friend was recently in Paris. He  told me that the Louvre Museum now offers \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" - tours ! ... so, that's what I'll be doing next time I'm in Paris !	2005-02-17

David Sedaris knows how to make his readers laugh. Over the years, he has used his family and his childhood to make us laugh, laugh out loud. When I read Sedaris' \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" I could not read it fast enough. I laughed out loud the whole time, and I could not put the book down.. Sedaris had me in stitches, belly laughing the whole time. I have read it several times and I have over the years bought that book to at least five or six of my friends, which is how much I loved the book. So, when I found \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim\\" I got all excited and couldn't wait to start reading it.<br /><br />\\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim\\" is a collection of essays, and I agree with other reviewers that it does not flow as well as it could have done. The stories are more touching than hilarious, which is not bad, but just was not what I was expecting.  However, there are a couple of great stories about 'The Rooster' that will make you laugh for sure. And the one where a young Sedaris and his friends are playing strip poker is pretty funny too.<br /><br />Rating this book was hard. It was an entertaining read and I won't say that it was disappointing, because it wasn't. It just wasn't as laugh-out-loud funny as his previous books.	2004-09-11

On our holiday in Barcelona earlier this year, my daughter stumbled over this book in a bookstore. She is against the death penalty and found the summary on the cover interesting so she asked if we could buy this book as our souvenir. As it turned out, I finished the book I was reading and needed something to read so I asked if I could read her \\"souvenir\\".<br />I was completely hooked from the first page. I read it in two long sittings at a Starbuck's in Barcelona.<br />Our protagonist is David Gale, a well-known professor at the University of Texas. A passionate anti death-penalty activist whose world is turned upside down when he is charged with raping and murdering a fellow professor and anti death-penalty activist.<br />We enter the story as he sits on death row, having been convicted of rape and murder. With only one week away from the execution date, he agrees to give the journalist Bitsey Bloom an exclusive interview. Before meeting with David Gale, Bitsey is convinced that he is guilty as charged. However, during the interview David present Bitsey with new information. As she look into what he has given her, Bitsey start to believe they arrested the wrong man.<br />The big question in this plot is - will she be able to clear his name before execution? The chosen subject matter was a stunning idea, and one of the best plots I've read in a long time. I was caught off guard when I came to the ending. I did not see that coming at all. Fascinating!<br />Great read!	2004-03-17

The novel &quot;The Blackwater lightship&quot; by Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n (shortlisted for the Booker Prize) was chosen as the second book to read (my first - as I have just joined the club). The number of girls attending our dinners vary between 3 and 12, all Australian but me. As I joined late, my friend Rachael had already finished the book. She did not care too much for it, so I started out slightly biased to the book. But that quickly changed, and I hadn't read too many pages before I emailed Rachael and said &quot;I really like this book!!&quot;..<br />The story is set in Ireland in the early 1990'ies, and it starts as a stranger comes to Helen O'Doherty's house to tell her that her brother, Declan, is dying of AIDS. Helen rushes to visits Declan in the hospital in Dublin. Declan tells her that he would like to leave the hospital and spend some time at his grandmother's house by the sea. Helen and Declan spent a lot of time at their grandparent's house as children, but Helen worries that a dying grandson will be to much for their aging grandmother. Nevertheless, they go there, and they all end up living at Dora's place: Declan, Helen, Lily, and two of Declan's friends; Paul and Larry.<br />Helen and her mother Lily have a very distant and (on the surface of things) unemotional relationship. It really impressed me that a man has with such amazing authenticity been able to capture this complex mother-daughter relationship.<br />Although Declan is the one who is dying, the book is first and foremost about Helen and how she accepts and understand the past, forgives what was to forgive, and how she grow to be emotionally attached again to her mother Lily.<br />My favorite character from the book is by far the grandmother, Dora. She is an amazingly strong and strong willed woman. I love how she takes a taxi to town every Wednesday to go shopping, and do her things. I just fell in love with her. My favorite scenes from the book is when Paul is `having a go' at Lily for not understanding anything - and Dora is on the sideline cheering for Paul. The second scene is when Larry is teaching Dora to drive. Absolutely fantastic!! The ending was lovely too, without being clich&eacute;d and predictable or sappy for that matter.<br />The author has an impressive ability to superbly develop characters. His writing style is in many ways similar to Hemingway, sparse but yet luminous. With &quot;The Blackwater Lightship&quot; Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has written a beautiful book. It's one of the finest explorations of a dysfunctional family I've come across.

I am part of a newly started book club. The number of girls attending our dinners vary between 3 and 12, all Australian but me. We had problems choosing a new book last time, but in the end, we settled for \\"Almost French\\" by Sarah Turnbull as our third book to read. All member of our book club are foreigners, living in England, so we figured we could and would sympathize with another \\"expat\\".<br />Sarah met Frederic while on a (very late) gap-year in Europe. They had a good time and agreed to meet up in France later. In short, they meet up, fall in love, and Sarah never leaves Paris.<br />Moving to another country is a massive challenge. You are bound to do all the \\"Top 10\\" big no-no's probably within the first 2 weeks. Sarah's portrait of Parisians is hilariously funny, from the snobby shopkeepers, old ladies with their well groomed dogs, uptight cocktail parties where no one really mingles, and unfriendly dinners with Frederic's friends to mention a few.<br />However, when we discussed this book, we all commented that it was not very balanced - 90% Sarah and 10% the rest. With that ratio, we get to know Sarah quite well. Honestly, she tends to whine quite a bit. We go through the motions with her - lonely, bored and feeling useless and not welcome (I got tired of the author asking over and over and over again \\"why don't they like me?\\"). However, her frustration for not being able to speak the language I can sympathize with. I have been in the same situation myself. I studied Spanish in Latin America. Trust me, when you only can speak in present tense with a very limited vocabulary, you sound like an idiot and the conversation dies quickly... But the most pathetic incident is when she realizes that she doesn't actually live in Paris but outside the city limit (defined by the postcode). She makes such a big fuzz about it. I cannot understand the big deal, and how Frederic is putting up with it (and in the end agrees to move) is beyond me...<br />But there is so much more - what about the relationship, it must have been very difficult for the rest of the people involved, not just Sarah.. Surely, we could have gotten to know the lovely Frederic better, his parents, his friends and the rest of it.<br />We all fell in love with Frederic. My favorite scenes are when they are pulled over for a minor traffic violation in Paris, and Frederic are trying to pretend to be an Australian. The way he is doing this is to take the jumper off his shoulders and tie it around his waist! I laughed out loud, it is so true! The ever so correct French have their jumpers neatly around their shoulders, and the less formal Australian would just tie them around the waist. The other scene is when Sarah one Saturday morning is running to the bakery to get fresh bread for breakfast. On her way out, Frederic catches a glimpse of her and nearly has a heart attach. \\"Are you going out like that, wearing your gymnastic pantaloons?\\" he asks. Sarah completely oblivious to his horror says, \\"Yeah, I'm just going to the bakery\\". Frederic says \\"But, that's not nice for the baker man...\\".<br />Say what you like, this book did change my life. I am now much more aware of how I am dressed when I go out, even if I am only getting the newspaper. I even went out and bought a new coat! I swear, I will never again wear sweatpants going to the store. Pants I thought were quite cute earlier are now in the pile \\"not to be found dead in\\".<br />Read the book, have a laugh.

Make sure that you get an edition that has a family tree of the Buend&iacute;a family in front of the book. Ear-dog that page, as you will use it repeatedly while working your way through this book.

An enormous strength of this book is Bergen's in-depth knowledge of his subject matter. `Holy War Inc.' represents years of exhaustive investigation, gutsy reporting, and unmatched access to some of the world's most ferocious killers and hazardous terrain. The author uses his extensive range of sources, including his own experiences, to draw a remarkable portrait of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda organization. Bergen also has the distinct advantage of being one of the very few Western journalists who have ever met with and interviewed Osama Bin Laden. It is intense reading when Bergen describes his trek to and into Afghanistan, including the wearing of blindfolds during the last part of the trip to bin Laden's hiding place.<br />Bergen deftly portrays al-Qaeda - a multi-national terrorist network, with `sleepers' and members all over the world - reaching from the city of Hamburg, to the suburbs of North-West London via Disney World to Egypt.

As a non-native English speaker I struggle with the language, but I still enjoy Shakespeare's writing.<br />This play is not called Shakespeare's greatest tragedy for nothing.

Yet, his ensign Iago is able to manipulate Othello into believing his wife is cheating on him.<br />This play shows how easily a perfectly honest man can be manipulated to the point where he is capable of killing the person he loves.<br />A powerful play.

He lost his fortune when the price of sugar dropped, and is now living with his brother and his pregnant wife.

We enter the story as Tom Joad, one of the children in the family, gets out of jail. He comes home, finding his family suffering from the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. Tormented and forced to leave their land, the Joad's strap as many of their belongings as they can to their truck. With the truck piled high they hit the road for their journey to promise land - to California.<br />The Joad's believe that leaving Oklahoma for California is the answer to all their troubles. California will be abundant with opportunities - work for everyone, plenty of food, oranges and peaches on every tree. Pa even has a leaflet saying they need thousands of men on the farms. Reality will soon catch up with them. The journey to California turns out to be everything but easy. They experience all sorts of hardship; loss of family members, trouble with the truck, harassment by the police and locals. When the Joad's finally make it to California, their troubles and suffering are rewarded not by work, plenty of food, and oranges on every tree, but with even more troubles. While moving around, following the different picking seasons chasing for work, the family is enduring such poor living conditions. They are living in squatter camps, government camps, and in the end shacks in labour camps.<br />The characters in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" are all very well developed.  They are so vivid and one cannot help but to care deeply for them all. Several of the characters have left a lasting impression; Tom Joad, Grandpa, the courageous ex-preacher, and above all Ma Joad. She is a loveable, courageous, strong woman and I admire her spirit, dignity and her determination as she struggles to keep her family together. Even facing so much testing and hardship, she still keeps perspective and hope.<br />An experiment that works well in this novel is the \\"in-between\\" chapters. Short stories with reflections and background about the Great Depression; how a used-car dealer take advantage of his desperate customers or how farmers sprayed oranges with kerosene and threw potatoes in the river to keep market prices up while hundreds of thousands of people was starving, as well as other small stories, true literary treasures such as the first \\"in-between\\" chapter about the turtle.<br />\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is written in a most memorable way.

While on interrail this summer, I stumbled over the \\"Music for Chameleons\\" in Prague. I have not read a lot of Capote, but nevertheless, this must be Capote at his best.<br />His writing is simple and direct, yet beautiful and elegant. In a way, his economic writing style reminds me of Hemingway. Eloquent, with not one word out of place. \\"Music for Chameleons\\" had my attention from the preface to the very last page. The author has this amazing ability to grab the reader's attention and hold on to it. When reading this book, I was a part of it. I was there; I could feel the emotions of each of the characters in the different stories.<br />The book contains several short stories and one non-fiction novel. I don't normally like short stories, but after reading this book, I am now a great fan of short stories. At least Capote's short stories. They are extraordinary!  My favorite among these stories is the story of his dope-smoking cleaning lady. A truly wicked story. The longer piece in this book, the novel, \\"Handcarved Coffins\\", is about his investigation of a murder case in Kansas. Great mystery, many details, and I read the whole story in one sitting.<br />\\"Music for Chameleons\\" is one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read and I read it in 50 page gulps. A compelling read. Highly recommended!	2003-10-04

I recently asked my English professor from University for a list of the 10 classics she considered a \\"must read\\". This novel, \\"Madame Bovary\\", was one of them.<br />I greatly enjoyed Flaubert's beautiful, beautiful prose. Not one word is out of place. Amazing. What a treasure! That this book was written 150 years ago is hard to imagine. If you change horses for cars, you wouldn't know.<br />\\"Madame Bovary\\" is a timeless novel. The characters are few, and they are all very well developed. In fact, it is not possible to not genuinely care for each individual in the story. Well everyone, except for the loan shark.<br />The protagonist, Emma, married very young to Charles Bovary, a doctor who once treated her father when he was ill. She never really loved her husband, but was bored and wanted to get away from home. Emma is pretty much a sweet, spoiled and bored housewife. On the other side, Charles is a lovely husband who does not know what good to do for her - he completely adores her. To compensate for being bored - Emma undertake almost daily shopping sprees. Buying all sorts of luxurious fabric for clothes, fancy china, furniture - you name it. Although her husband is a doctor, and is making decent money, she is spending well over their means. Behind Charles' back Emma signs promise-note after promise-note (the credit card of the 17th century). After a while, the shopping is not enough to keep her happy, and she is seeking excitement outside her marriage. She is having several affairs. In the beginning all well covered up, but after a while Emma is taking more and more chances, and is getting reckless. Of course, this cannot go on forever, Emma's \\"card house\\" is doomed to fall apart.  Which it does, with a truly tragic ending..<br />I read the book in 50 page gulps at the time, and I found it so hard to put away. I truly enjoyed every page! A great read and a true classic!	2003-09-07

Left it with a friend, and just recently got it back. I had been looking forward to read it for a long time, but I was not at all impressed. \\"The Trial\\" is a book that was just that, a trial, and it gave me nothing but frustration. What saved me for feeling that it had been a total waste of time, was that Kafka have created some interesting characters and the, at times, beautiful language. The rest gave me grey hair.<br />Try something else of Kafka's work. Other novels must be better than this one.	2003-03-02

Yergin has written an outstanding book, so well researched that just the notes and bibliography together are almost 100 pages!! This book is highly deserving of the Pulitzer price.<br />Reading this book will be like an intensive course / refresher of your history knowledge of the last two centuries. The author starts back in the 19th century. The big day, 27 August 1859, the day \\"The Colonel\\" Edwin L. Drake found oil in Titusville, Texas - till just after the Golf War in 1991.<br />A book covering the last two centuries, gives us quite naturally, a large dose of world history. And many pages are dedicated to men that made a huge impact, and was an important part of this history - Nobel, Teagle, Rockefeller, \\"The Colonel\\" (Drake), Gulbenkian, and Churchill just to mention a few. Further, the author gives us an insight to the politics in the oil industry, governmental interference and how the politics in the industry works (or don't...). In lay man terms Yergin explains why and how vulnerable the industry is, about the more resent but also the past oil-crisis, how little it takes for the oil-price to spin out of control, and how the economies around the world more and more depend on the black gold.<br />Unfortunately, with its +800 pages this is not a book you accidentally pick just to have something to read. I am sure that the length of this book keeps lay readers away from it and that is a shame. It can be quite daunting project to start on, but once you have started, you will not put it away until you have finished it. I must admit that I was a little sceptical to what level the language would be on, but fear not, the book is kept on an accessible level, even for the lay reader. To the author's credit, he strikes the perfect balance between facts, technical jargon, and anecdotes, which makes \\"The Prize\\" a long, time-consuming, but nevertheless fascinating and entertaining read.<br />I found \\"The Prize\\" to be a great overview over the industry. I picked up lots and lots of new facts from this book, and I am certain that I will cite this book in the future. On a personal note, I wish the author would update the book with more than a new preface. A few more chapters to include the last decade as well would be highly welcome.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to fill in on the knowledge of the oil industry.ing read.<br />I found \\"The Prize\\" to be a great overview over the industry.

I have read a few of Spalding Gray's books, and I found them hysterically funny. So a while back I decided to work my way through all of his books. All his books have been bought and are on my shelf, so I hope this one is just one of those bad apples..<br />Don't get me wrong, Spalding is a very, very funny guy. And the other books I have read (\\"Sex and death to the Age 14\\" and \\"Morning, Noon and Night\\") are just fantastic books. They made me laugh out loud over and over and over again.<br />This one however.. Not quite... It is more a \\"transcript\\" of his stage performances. You can tell that this would be hysterically funny onstage, but reading it on an overcrowded tube on my way to work was maybe not the best setting, and probably didn't give this material justice.<br />Anyway, I think these stories are better left for live performances.	2003-03-02

I found his non-fiction work to be very interesting, and I love his easygoing writing style. When I heard that he had written a fiction novel (\\"The Emperor of Ocean Park\\") I eagerly went out and bought a copy.<br />The lead character is Talcott Garland. A professor with an Ivy League Law school, married to Kimmer (herself a very good Lawyer) and together they have one son. In short, when Talcott's father (Judge Oliver Garland) passes away, under rather questionable circumstances, the family (especially Talcott's sister Mariah) starts to ask question. Talcott discovers a secret that he believes noone else has found out about. And the way this is laid out, he believes (together with others) that he is the only one whom can solve this mystery. When people, connected to Judge Garland, starts dying \\"like flies\\" around Talcott, the pressure is on him to both solve the mystery and protect his family.<br />This is a deeply intriguing story, and \\"The Emperor of Ocean Park\\" kept me completely hooked from the first page. Very interesting and well-developed characters from a level in society that aren't too often represented in best-seller novels (affluent African-Americans with great education and successful at work). I truly didn't want this book to end. It was such an exciting book to read. I read it in long sittings at the time, completely mesmerized. Well, till it was maybe 30 pages or so left. Then I started to fear that the ending wasn't going to be as good as the rest of the book had been. And, I didn't like the ending at all. Enough said about that.<br />The book kept me for 580+ pages or so, and it takes a good writing talent to do that!<br />I recommend it, but be aware of the not \\"clever\\" ending.	2003-03-02

It is interesting to read how the Clinton administration planned to (and did to a large extent) keep focus on domestic issues, but was more or less forced to take action internationally, as different conflicts (Haiti, Somalia, Balkans) caught up with America.<br />The Vietnam War had made many decision-makers in America unwilling to use American soldiers to take action internationally. For example, initially, no serious attention was given to Slobodan Milosevic and his men. In fact, for a long time the Clinton administration chose to ignore all reports from the Balkans. Clinton's Admin staff deliberately used expressions such as \\"act of genocide\\" and equal omitting expressions, to avoid acknowledging that genocide in fact took place. The failure of using forces against Milosevic, gave him the opportunity to set out on an ethnic cleansing spree, bordering to what happened to Jews during WWII.<br />I said that this book covers the foreign policy of the 1990'ies.. To be fair, 30 pages or so to cover Bush Sr., and the rest to Clinton. The title \\"War in a time of Peace\\" is slightly misleading, although Somalia and Haiti are covered, this really is a book mostly on the Balkans. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this book.<br />Reading this book made me understand what really happened in the Balkans and why. As usual, Halberstam's book is very well researched, with fascinating insights. The pages describing how technological advanced US is compared to other countries, and its abilities (missiles hitting only a few feet off target), must fascinate every reader!<br />Highly recommended!<br />After reading \\"War in a time of Peace\\" I've picked up that this book is more or less a sequel to Halberstam's book on the Vietnam War \\"The best and the brightest\\". I am doing this the other way around.. \\"The best and the brightest\\" is my next book to read..<br />After reading \\"War in a time of Peace\\" I've picked up that this book is more or less a sequel to Halberstam's book on the Vietnam War \\"The best and the brightest\\".

I had heard a lot about Hornby's books, and quite few guys I know had recommended them as hilariously funny. \\"Fever Pitch\\" was recommended as the absolute best one, so I thought I'd better read it.<br />The book is about Arsenal, Hornby, and what it means to be a soccer (football) fan (not a hooligan, just severely addicted to soccer). And oh my God! Hornby qualifies for the die-hard group by far! We are talking about *serious* addiction to soccer!! Or what do you say to scheduling your whole life (career & work / partner / social etc) around the possibility of a re-play of a game? Or saying \\"no\\" to weddings because it collides with an Arsenal match? Someone at work told me that this book would be insightful to understanding English men / soccer fans.. If that is true - I'll stay clear!<br />Since I am not English, I probably missed a few (good?) jokes due to my obvious lack of native soccer lingo. But even so, there was plenty for me to enjoy. And the book certainly made me laugh out loud, several times. \\"Fever Pitch\\" was a fast and easy read and I read this book in a few sittings.

Therefore, I am always looking for books that can fill gaps in my knowledge. \\"The Children\\" is such a book.<br />This is one of the best books you can find covering the Civil Right Movement. With a journalists precision Halberstam narrates the extraordinary story of the rise of the Civil Rights movement, which in the end broke the back of the Deep South segregation. \\"The Children\\" covers the fight for racial equality, including student protests, the story of lunch-counter sit-ins, to the freedom marches. We meet Sheriff Bull Connor, Jim Crow on the one side of the fight, and the young students James Lawson, Rodney Powell, and Diana Nash amongst others on the other side.<br />Halberstam does an excellent job showing us what the Civil Right movement was all about, and what its supporters had to endure to end the segregation in the South. His first-hand familiarity with the conflict is evident throughout the whole book. (What most people don't think of is that, the covering the Civil Right movement was David Halberstam first \\"serious\\" story as a journalist for the Tennessean in Nashville. He was fresh out of colleague and a complete \\"nobody\\" in the world of journalism!)<br />\\"The Children\\" was my first reading on the Civil Right movement and it was a true eye-opener for me. I learned so much from this book. With 800 pages \\"The Children\\" is not a quick read, but I never felt that too much was included. Now, 2 years later I still refer to this book when discussing the topic.<br />This is one of the best books that I have ever read. \\"The Children\\" should be required reading for everyone. I couldn't recommend it higher!	2002-10-22

The book \\"The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr.\\" is Stanford University historian Clayborne Carson's amazing account of one of the most impressive leaders to have ever lived.<br />This is an outstanding biography and it accounts for the full story of Dr. King, literally from cradle to grave. Martin Luther King Jr. at university, when he met his wife Coretta, their children being born, the movement begins, fights and struggles, getting arrested etc. etc. Carson does an absolutely amazing job transporting the reader into Dr. King's thoughts, ideas and feelings. I have only read a couple of other biographies that I rank as high as I rank this one. The other two are Che Guevara and Malcolm X's biographies.<br />Few people are given strength, means and opportunity to make a real and great impact in the world. Martin Luther King Jr. was not only given such opportunity; he seized upon his opportunity as well. His fights and sacrifices made life better not only for millions of black people in America - his fight made the world a better place to be for all of us.<br />The author uses Dr. King's letters, college papers, and speeches; such as the \\"I have a dream\\" speech from 1963, and the Nobel Peace Prize speech from 1964 when telling his story. I had never read the whole \\"I have a dream\\" speech, so I greatly enjoyed that.<br />Carson has done a great jobs combining his own research with Dr. King's own speeches and writings and this is all masterfully woven together into a unique biography. Dr. King had a huge impact on the Civil Right movement, and he made his way into American history as one of its greatest, most charismatic leaders ever.<br />My recommendation is given for two reasons. Firstly, Dr. King is an extraordinary interesting subject, but also because of Carson's excellent job writing this biography.<br />Great read - highly recommended!	2002-10-22

Coetzee was awared the Booker Prize for this book back in 1983, so I had great expectations for this book. \\"Life &amp; Times of Michael K\\" did not disappoint me, and I think it is highly deserving of the Booker prize.<br />The story is set in South Africa, in the midst of poverty, Apartheid, and Civil war. We enter the story when Michael K is 30 years old, and working as a gardener. Michael K was born with a harelip, which has never been fixed. His mother, Anna K, works as a maid for the Buhrmann family. As the civil war erupts the family Anna was working for flees out of town. While continuing to watch out for the apartment and the belongings to her employer, Anna falls ill. She has only one wish that K takes her back to Prince Albert where she was born.<br />On their way there (fleeing in the night, K pushing his mother in wheelbarrow) a day or two in to their journey, Anna is admitted to a hospital where she shortly after passes away. K is devastated with grief, and he looses all energy to continue. He finally makes it to Prince Albert, carrying his mothers ashes in a box. The war catches up with K, and he is taken to a camp where everyone is given food and shelter in return for their labour. K (or \\"Michaels\\" as one of the guards calls him) seeks no physical contacts with others, he feels no hunger and as a result, we see this mentally sleeping skeleton emerge.<br />K continues to flee from the camp where he is held. We follow his struggle to live his life the way he wants to, free and as one with nature.<br />The author introduces us to a topic that those of us who are not South Africans will probably never quite understand. Coetzee is a splendid writer, and his writing style is compelling, dark, but immensely beautiful.<br />A remarkable read reflecting on a man's inner strength. Highly recommended!	2002-08-27

Cunningham received the Pen/Faulkner Award and the Pulitzer Prize for this book in 1999.<br />We meet three women in this story. The first woman we meet is the author Virginia Wolff, living in London in the 1920'ies. We enter the story while she is writing \\"Mrs Dalloway\\". The second woman we meet, Laura Brown, is living in LA in the late 1940'ies, and reading \\"Mrs Dalloway\\". She is a 30'ish woman, married with one son, pregnant with child number two. She is the housewife struggling both with her self-image/identity, and with something as trivial as how to prepare the perfect cake for her husband's birthday. Slightly claustrophobic from the life that is closing in on her, she sets out driving, checking in to a hotel, just to be able to sit alone and read.. The third woman we meet is present day Clarissa Vaughn, a gay woman in her 50'ies, working as a literary agent and living in Greenwich Village. She is planning a party for her dying friend and ex-lover Richard. He has just received a major literary award, and Clarissa wants to celebrate the reward.<br />What starts out as three separate stories, Cunningham masterfully weaves into one gripping story in the end. Very impressive!<br />I had not read Mrs. Dalloway before reading this book and I know for sure that I would have enjoyed the book even more if I had been familiar with Virginia Wolff's writing prior to reading \\"The Hours\\". Because what to me in the beginning seemed to be meaningless jumping back and forth between three women, would instead probably have appeared to be elegant and seamless shifting between the three protagonists' stories.<br />Having said that, I really enjoyed the book. I am going to read \\"Mrs Dalloway\\" and then re-read \\"The Hours\\". An enjoyable read!	2002-08-27

I only started reading Hemingway a couple of years ago, yet I have become a huge fan of Papa Hemingway. His brutally economic writing style is simply fascinating. A masterful command of the English language!<br />\\"A farewell to arms\\" is the unforgettable story of this novella's protagonist, Lt. Frederic Henry (often referred to as Tenente). He was an American who during the World War I volunteered to serve for the Italian Army Ambulance Corps. He becomes the first American to be wounded in the war, and later receives the \\"Medal of Valor\\" for his deeds. Co-protagonist, Catherine Barkley, a beautiful British nurse, was working at the hospital where Tenente was later admitted after getting injured in the war.<br />Shortly after Catherine and Tenente met, they started their affair. In the beginning of their affair, Henry was thinking of this purely as a way to pass time, and did not plan to get serious at all. But we all know that feelings can't be planned nor controlled, and soon enough their affair turned serious for both of them.<br />Seldom is there a more hazardous combination than love and war. It is the love story that drives this novel forward, combined with the account of the war. It is easy to detect Hemingway's first hand familiarity with the World War I. This is Hemingsway's story, his endeavour to put into words the emotions he experienced, the environment that he was surrounded by, and the people he got to know.<br />All characters are very well developed. The fact that every character is so very well developed with Hemingway's brutally spare style, makes it even more impressive. One of my favourites is Henry's friend, the priest Rinaldi whom believes in traditional values and who constantly suffers from the other soldier's teasing because of his beliefs.<br />This novel represents a landmark in the genre of war fiction. It held my attention from beginning to end. It is a timeless classic, and I couldn't recommend it higher!<br />A great read!	2002-08-18

I picked up this book after reading about it and friends recommending it as a great laugh.. And \\"Lord of the Barnyard, Killing the fatted calf and arming the aware in the cornbelt\\" was funny, for a long while and it did make me laugh many times..<br />The protagonist, John Kaltenbrunner, was born and raised in Baker, a trash city in no-where land. He has lived a life, continuous with misfortunes and tragic events from even before he was born. As a very young boy he showed extreme interest and talent in running the family farm. School was of no interest, and each hour spent there he thought of as wasted time. As a teenager still in school, his mother Madam Kaltenbrunner falls ill. John helplessly watches how the people from the Methodist church lurks around, takes care of his mother in return for piece after piece of beautiful antique furniture from the farm. I really enjoyed following the war between John and the Methodist church, with Hortense as the focal point.<br />This is certainly not a read for people who like to identify themselves with the story's protagonist, the story is too far off for that. And with over 400 pages of John's insane world - the author outstays his welcome just a little bit..<br />Having said that, I really enjoyed parts of this book, but it is a bizarre more than a funny read..	2002-08-18

Lewis' has written a good book, albeit not an easy read. \\"The Multiple Identities of the Middle East\\" is based on three of Lewis' papers held at different conferences during the period 1989-1995. For this book, these papers were combined with material from articles and other conference papers Lewis has written.<br />The book is divided into nine chapters, covering topics such as Religion, Country, Nation, and the State to mention some of them. Rather than giving us a brief overview, the author goes deep, deep into details.

Lewis' has written a good book, albeit not an easy read. \\"The Multiple Identities of the Middle East\\" is based on three of Lewis' papers held at different conferences during the period 1989-1995. For this book, these papers were combined with material from articles and other conference papers Lewis has written.<br />The book is divided into nine chapters, covering topics such as Religion, Country, Nation, and the State to mention some of them.

US	51036921	R3GOINHAMYEH1Y	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Truly an American Classics!	I bought this book last year, but I just hadn't got around to read it. But for my holiday, I rounded up 3-4 of those \\"must reads\\" that was waiting on the shelf and took off. And what a great read this was! I loved \\"The Great Gatsby\\" from the very first page.<br />Written in the 1920'ies one would think that this novel would be outdated by now. But a book doesn't get the label \\"a great classic\\" for no good reason. Fitzgerald, with \\"The Great Gatsby\\", has written a novel with a timeless message.<br />The story's narrator, Nick Carraway, is the neighbour to the novel's protagonist Jay Gatsby. We enter the story when Jay has transformed from being a poor officer to a self made millionaire. He is throwing fantastic parties every weekend on his mansion on Long Island. Lots of people, lit garden, swimming pool and the full nine yards. Gatsby is a self-invented person, no one really knows him, what he does, or where he's from, but they all come to his parties. One of the other protagonists, Daisy Buchanan is married to Tom, but Daisy used to go out with Jay Gatsby. Back then when he was a poor guy and a no-body. When Jay went to serve overseas, Daisy married Tom. Tom is an incredibly rich young man. Brutal, low moral, arrogant and you name it.. but extraordinary rich..<br />So that's the scene setting for this novel. This book has everything, the (impossible) love story, money and wealth, greed, affairs, jealousy and obsessions. Fitzgerald's writing style is vivid and eloquent. Simply an elegant use of the language! His language reminds me of Hemingway, one of my other favourites. The different characters are extraordinary well developed. I especially liked the cynical narrator of the story, Nick Carraway.<br />Fitzgerald has written one of the best books I have ever read. This is a short book, and I read it in 50-page gulps at the time. A great book, ready to be re-read any day!!<br />PS. Make sure to get this edition, as it has a great preface written by Matthew Bruccoli. The preface contains valuable information about the author and background information on the story itself. Read the preface first, you will benefit from it.i. The preface contains valuable information about the author and background information on the story itself.

Therefore, I am always looking for books that can fill gaps in my knowledge. \\"All the President's men\\" is such a book.<br />The beginning of this book contains a \\"Cast of Characters\\", a detailed description of persons and their involvement in the case. If you are a like me, you make sure to dog-ear this page for your reference, as you work your way through the flurry of different names and places. Fear not, the struggle of keeping track of everyone involved is worth it!<br />This book provides us with two distinct \\"different\\" story-lines. First, a fascinating description of investigative journalism. We learn how newspapers work, the fights over cover-page stories, the importance of getting your name under the story line, and arguments and discussions in the editor's office. I particularly came to admire the owner of the Washington Post, Cathrine Graham, for her tremendous courage during this period. The newspaper received threats, directed to specific people, as well as with regards to possible lawsuits. The case could have brought the paper down and destroyed it completely. Second, the very detailed and interesting guide to the collapse of Richard Nixon, the 37th President of the United States.<br />The Watergate Scandal started innocently enough, with a simple break-in in the Democratic headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. The \\"Washington Post\\" had Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward covering the case. The two inexperienced reporters would soon see that the more they kept digging, the more obscure and unbelievable the story got. In the end, they had a list of people involved including the top level of government, the US intelligence community and ultimately, the White House itself.<br />What most people don't think of is that, back in the summer of 1972, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were two young and enthusiastic, but complete \\"nobodies\\" in the world of journalism. What they had in common was that they both worked in the Washington Post's \\"Metro section\\", but not much more. They disliked each other, and were not keen on working together. So, after spending the first months using a lot of energy mistrusting each other, they learned how to trust each other and work together.<br />These two young men set in motion a powerful legacy, which extends well beyond their first set of writings for the Washington Post. They covered the case that stands as a milestone in US history. The Watergate Scandal won Woodward and Bernstein fame and fortune, including the Pulitzer Price. Their book \\"All the President's men\\" details all the events of one of the greatest political scandal in US history, which in the end, brought down a President.<br />\\"All the President's men\\" is fast-paced, and easy to read. It gives a very good summary of the Watergate Scandal (and American history) to the lay reader.<br />Comparing the Watergate Scandal with the election in Florida a couple of years back, or Clinton's Lewinsky affair and Travelgate, I think that \\"All the President's men\\" puts things in perspective for us, and highlights a REAL political scandal.<br />I couldn't recommend it more.

(If you have forgot, longitude is the \\"lines\\" that runs from pole to pole). Not being able to determining longitude was a great problem. Ships spent excessive time trying to find its way back to port, or worse men, ship and cargo were lost at sea.<br />John Harrison (1693-1776) spent his lifetime trying to solve the longitude mystery. Harrison was a son of a countryman, with minimal schooling, and was self-educated in watch making. He made several timepieces, which all qualified for the reward, but the reward was delayed several times by the Longitude committee whom believed that other ways of measuring longitude were the preferred ones. Ultimately after a lot of harassment and trouble, Harrison was given the reward money.<br />Dava Sobel has done a wonderful job in this book, capturing Harrison's fascinating character, his brilliance, preserving and hard working nature. The author has also managed to strike a perfect balance between technical jargon and personal anecdotes, and she does it in such a way permitting the lay readers of the book to admire the elegance of Harrison's discoveries. I believe it is a sign of excellent quality when an author makes learning so interesting.<br />I was hooked from the first page of this book and I read it in 50-page gulps at a time.<br />Highly recommended!	2002-07-07
US	51036921	RBYK5SYF0FR5Q	0385503954	977000479	Atonement: A Novel	Books	5	3	5	N	N	The best so far!	I picked up this book right after moving to London last fall. It had received lots of media coverage, and it was nominated for the Booker prize (now we know that it didn't win..) I have read most of McEwan's books, and truly loves his writing. \\"Atonement\\", together with \\"Comfort of Strangers\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\" are the books that I have liked the best.<br />\\"Atonement\\" is one story told through three (almost) \\"separate\\" novellas. First part takes us to England in the 1930'ies. We meet the Tallis family. They live on a beautiful estate, with servants and you name it. The protagonist, is the 13-year-old daughter of the family, Briony Tallis. She is quite theatrical (which kid of 13 doesn't? My 12-year-old daughter certainly competes well against Briony!) and wants to be a writer. She is daily writing on her master play, and she is planning to set up a play that summer, using the whole family as the actors.<br />But something happens that summer, and with a child's mind and perception, she is unable to control the situation. I am not sure if Briony lied, or if she told the truth, truth the way she perceived it. Nevertheless, without realizing, her fantasy and imaginary world soon ruin the world of two of her loved ones, her sister Cecilia and the son of the housekeeper, Robbie. After that, things can never go back to what it was. No matter how much she would later give up in life as her personal atonement, things would, and could, never be the same again.<br />The second part of \\"Atonement\\" jumps to the 1940'ies, and it gets us through the WWII in England and France, and the third part brings us to present, and we end up in 1999 for a rendez-vous on the Tallis estate.<br />McEwan is a true master of writing. All characters are (as usual) very well developed. I like Briony, but I also have a soft spot for her slightly eccentric mom, and the son of the housekeeper, Robbie Turner. The themes in \\"Atonement\\" are well known - love and peace, loyalty vs. obligation, innocence vs. guilt, reality vs. imagination. A less clever writer might have lost the reader's attention, but gifted as he is, McEwan pulls this together masterly!<br />This is a true page-turner. Highly recommended!vs. guilt, reality vs. imagination.

US	51036921	R3JV8EVBP6TI2V	0385722109	660348741	Hotel World	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Not particularly interesting	I have not read any of Ali smith's previous writing, nor had I heard of her previous to reading this book. I picked up this book solely because I saw that it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize together with Ian McEwan (one of my favourite authors).<br />The concept of this book is interesting enough. We meet 5 main characters. Sara Wilby, the 19-year-old chambermaid. She was a very talented swimmer, and could easily have been testing for the national team.  On one of her first days working at the Gobal Hotel, she bets with Duncan if she can fit into the dumbwaiter. She could, but she also plummeted to her death while doing so. Lise, she is the kind but slightly depressed reseptionist at Golbal's frontdesk. Else, or Elspeth, the homeless girl that Lise let stay one night for free. Else is usually begging outside of the Global Hotel. When she's not, she is wandering the streets, watching TV through the windows of other people's houses. Penny, a newspaper reviewer surveying the hotel, and Clare, Sara Wilby's grieving sister. Clare visits the hotel, determined to find out exactly what happened the day her sister died.<br />Each chapter is written in a different style, some works better than others. The stream-of-consciousness narration reminds me of A. S. Byatt, but Ali Smith is not able to bring it to same level. The chapter where \\"&\\" is used instead of \\"and\\", well, that gimmick gets tiresome after a while. The first chapters were interesting, and my favourite is Else's chapter. But after a while, I got tried with the whole idea, and must admit that I was glad when I was finished reading it.<br />How this novel got shortlisted to the Booker Prize I cannot understand. I give it 3 stars because I really liked Else...	2002-05-13

Michael Chabon's \\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay\\" is a fascinating novel. Although this was my first Chabon book, I had already heard a lot of praise for his previous writing. Contrary to what I expected, this is an adult novel with adult topics, covering themes such as the Nazi's, love and war, magic and heroism, evil vs. good in business, sexuality etc.<br />This novel has two lead characters; Josef Kavalier (refugee from Prague) and cousin to Samuel Klayman (raised by his mother in Brooklyn, NYC).<br />We enter the story in Prague in the late 1930'ies where we get to meet Josef Kavalier. Josef uses his training as an escape artist to leave the occupied Prague for freedom in America. Josef hid on the train to the border in a casket with a Golem (a Jewish religious figure made of clay). Forced to leave his family behind, he hopes that when he gets to America he can earn enough money so that they can again be reunited. The first part of the book is unbelievably convincing. This is one of my favourite parts of this book, and it could perfectly well work as a separate novel.<br />Samuel is first introduced to Josef when his mother asks him one night to move over in bed, to make room for his refugee cousin from Prague. This is, against all odds, the start of a marvellous friendship. Samuel (Sam) is the gifted storyteller and Josef (Joe), the skilled artist, and together they're an amazing creative duo. Sam who is already working in the comic industry (although he is on the lowest step on the ladder), persuades his boss to take on Joe and to publish \\"The Escapist\\" - the comic character they have created together. \\"The Escapist\\" becomes a enormous commercial success. As two freshmen to the industry, Sam and Joe, gets cheated by the publisher. They have sold the copyright to \\"The Escapist\\" and are left with almost nothing. But unlike Sam, Joe is driven by motives far more complex than money and success. He is fighting his personal war against the Nazi's and Hitler's Germany. We see that the battle of \\"The Escapist\\" grows more violent and disturbing, as Joe's attempt to get reunited with his family fails.<br />This book covers an amazing span of topics; and \\"escape\\" in all different ways is the theme that holds this book together. Heartbreaking love stories, failures and tragedies leading to the escape from life and reality, business and investment failures, brave soldiers in Antarctica and the most fascinating story, the love so strong leading to the fantastic \\"escape\\" back to life and reality again.<br />Chabon has clearly done his research on comic books. His style is very smooth, and his writing is unquestionably talented and imaginative. I loved the way he told this story, although the plot is fragmented and it bounces in all kinds of directions. Time after time the plot catches you off guard. At times the scenes were very short and almost cut off, other times extremely detailed to make sure you have everything \\"under your skin\\". The characters are finely drawn, and they develop more slowly than they do in shorter novels. All characters are beautifully developed, even the not so important characters, we get to know well. We get stories within the story, which could easily been stand-alone novels. Despite the sheer weight of the book (at 630 something pages this is not a quick read) I never found the book to be too long or needlessly verbose.<br />I think that Chabon has done a marvellous job mixing it all together, the real with the unreal, together with the story of two young men trying to live the American Dream.<br />Highly deserving of its Pulitzer price.

So when he told me that, I got a bit concerned that maybe the writing style of this book would be \\"slightly over my head\\". But to the authors credit, General Palmer strikes an almost prefect balance between technical jargon, military expressions, and personal anecdotes. This makes \\" Summons of the Trumpet\\" an easy, enjoyable read, even for the lay reader like myself. (Every now and then I felt that it would have been useful to have better knowledge of the military language, but all in all I was able to follow without any problems..)<br />This book is truly an excellent historical overview over what happened and why. General Palmer tracks the history of the American engagement in Vietnam. He focuses on the military strategy, and in an unbiased and detailed way he describes the war step by step. How things started, what the war was fought for, how it was fought, the victories the US won, and why it ended the way it did.<br />I had very little knowledge about the start of the conflict, and why US got involved in the first place. I was completely fascinated by Palmer's writing, and it really was impossible for me to put the book down. I was looking forward to going home from work, as the hour commute back and forth to work is my \\"reading-time\\".<br />\\"Summons of the Trumpet\\" gave me a deeper insight into a war I knew very little about. I know for sure that I will cite this book in the future.<br />I couldn't recommend it higher. Great read!	2002-05-05

This book touches on many interesting topics, Cuba's history, politics, drug trafficking, and money laundering to mention a few. This book taught me a whole lot of things. (I read first Che's biography, and followed up with this one. It certainly helped me a lot to have Che's biography as a base when reading this book). The fact that the book is nearly ten years old is not so important. The situation hasn't changed much, unfortunately. ...<br />Oppenheimer shows extensive knowledge about Cuba's history and culture. The research undertaken to write this book is no less than impressive. Especially when considering the fact that Castro is rather paranoid when it comes to criticism. How Oppenheimer got the Cubans to talk I don't know... But the fact that he is a fluent Spanish speaker definitely helped him while researching for this book.<br />I truly enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the political situation in Cuba.<br />An interesting read!	2002-03-16

He was also one of the most complex public figures of Latin America.<br />This biography is complete from the birth of Che in 1926, his upbringing in upper-class Argentina, his youth which spent in the highlands due to his severe asthmatic condition, including his schooling and medical training, his (early) spirit for adventure, his unusual close relationship with his mother, his meeting with Castro in Mexico, and of course his well-known participation in the defeat of the Batista government in Cuba and the event that followed, which finally would lead to his death in Bolivia.<br />The author conducted a comprehensive research to reveal Che, the man and the myth, and the events in Che's life that formed him to be the socialist revolutionary that he became. Anderson's biography is really a look on the inside of Che's head, merely due to the fact that much of the author's research is based on Che's own letters to his family and his private diaries. Even better, Che's second wife, Aleida March also cooperated with Mr. Anderson, giving him access to information about Che and also to some of his writings, granting us an even closer and more private look into our hero's (private) life. This book is nearly 800 pages long, and no easy read. Nevertheless, it is worth all the time you invest reading it. Anderson has not only done a thorough research, but I believe that with his unlimited access to sources close to Che, he has clarified inaccuracies and errors in preceding writings about Che.<br />Whether you agree with his politics or not, Che is revealed as a man with a purpose and a vision, who cared profoundly and sacrificed everything for the cause he believed in. His main motive was to improve the condition of the poor people of the world; to stop Western (read: capitalism and the US) from exploiting the Latin American people and its recourses. Che's remarkable persistence and single mindedness, were valuable personal traits to have in the beginning of the Guerilla Warfare. But the same traits made it presumably impossible for Che to re-group and change, as the world changed, Communism started declining, and Glasnost became everyone's favorite word. It is tempting to compare Malcolm X and Che Guevara as they both were (in their own way) fighting for the same cause. Che lacked one thing that Malcolm X had; the ability to change view when realizing that he had been mistaken in his beliefs and views of the world.<br />The book didn't convert me from democrat to communist, but it gave me a greater understanding as to the other side of the argument. Even if you find the methods of the guerilla group awful and sickening, it's hard not to respect Che's courage. In the end, I came away with a feeling of mercy for this strong and passionate man who gave so much of himself, his life included, for the beliefs he held to be true, beliefs which he never wavered from.<br />To be honest, prior to my trip to Latin America in 1999 I knew very little of Che. I am too young (I was born the same year he was killed) to have had Guevara as anything but a handsome \\"cultural icon\\". As a teenager, I kept his poster on the same wall where I had my James Dean and Abba posters.. But during the year I spent trekking around in Latin America, studying Spanish, my curiosity was definitively aroused. Upon returning home, this biography was one of the first books that I bought. Funny enough, while in Latin America I visited all the places mentioned in the book except for Bolivia. We even got to be in Cuba on the 8th of October, the day Fidel & Co celebrates Che. It was absolutely amazing to see hundreds of thousands of people parading on the Molocon. (I don't necessarily think you have to have spent time in Cuba or Latin America to enjoy this book, but it definitively helped me capture much of this story's \\"subtleties\\").<br />This book also contains some excellent photos. I love the one of the young Che, relaxing on the balcony, and also his self-portrait of his undercover identity as an old man on his way to Bolivia (Excellent disguise! Even his kids did not recognize him!). If I can have one picture removed it would be the picture of the dead Che \\"laying on display\\". We don't really need to see that photo.<br />This must be the best book yet written about Che and it should be considered compulsory read for everyone.

He has been accused of racism. His remark was made in class, about two students who never showed up for his lectures. \\"Do they exist or are they spooks?\\" he asked his class. It turned out that these two non-performing students were African-Americans, and (I didn't know) \\"spooks\\" were (still are?) considered racial slur.<br />Coleman Silk had until then, run the college with a firm hand. He is respected amongst his colleagues, but I guess, not much liked. So for his enemies at the college this racial slur incident was a \\"too good to be missed\\" opportunity. A formal complaint is handed in. Silk is a proud man, and he refuses to defend himself. He choose to step down from his position.<br />Nathan Zuckerman, a friend of the protagonist, Coleman Silk, narrates \\"The Human Silk\\". Zuckerman's narration is interesting albeit at times a bit confusing. He alternates between present and past time, and swaps between \\"being inside someone's head\\" and then reports just from a spectators perspective.<br />This is one of the few novels that I have read where I felt that all characters were very well developed. As I was reading this book, I felt as if I was a part of the story, and at the end I felt as if I knew them all very well. The characters were not always likable, in fact more often were they unsympathetic and despicable than sympathetic, but indeed very well developed.<br />Actually, the characters worked often as independent stories within the story. Silk is having a romantic affair with Faunia Farley (34). An (supposedly) illiterate, cleaning lady at the college. Via her, we are introduced to her nutty ex-husband Lesley Farley. He is a Vietnam Vet, still struggling with post-war traumas. We meet Delphine Roux, an arrogant French woman, and member of the staff whom Silk hired years ago. And of course, Nathan Zukerman, the narrator, and friend of Silk.<br />But the best independent story is that it turns out that for his entire adult life, Coleman Silk has been covering up the fact that he is a black (!) man. Silk is light skinned enough to pass for white. And it was after the WWII war that he decided to reinvent himself as a Jew, so he could have his dream fulfilled, to have a career as a professor. Each page I read I waited for Silk to be \\"caught\\", convinced that he couldn't possibly \\"pull that off\\", but it never happened... Quite ironic that he fifty years after \\"going white\\" is being charged with a racial complaint, hm??<br />This was my first Philip Roth novel, and I enjoyed it very much. I will definitely read more of Roth's novels.<br />Anyway, like I said, this was a great read. \\"The Human Stain\\" fully deserves its' PEN/Faulkner award.. <br />But the best independent story is that it turns out that for his entire adult life, Coleman Silk has been covering up the fact that he is a black (!) man.

Well done!<br />Diamond is not a historian; he explores human prehistory from a scientific standpoint. His theory is that the development of civilization and technology came essentially as a result to four factors; 1) the availability of animals and plants to be domesticated (tough luck if the seeds you had were adapted to a different altitude or longitude that you were on, or if the only animals around were dangerous or not economically feasible to domesticate such as hippopotamus or the koala bear), 2) the ease with which the domestication can be relocated (again, the adaptability of the animals or seeds, going east to west was obviously easier than to go from north to south due to similar climates/altitudes at the same longitude), 3) isolation (transfer of knowledge between countries and continents), and 4) the size of the population (more people, more brains, higher chance of someone coming up with something smart).<br />Diamond's basic thesis does have some validity, although I was often left with the feeling that we were only presented with the information that proved the authors point. By building his arguments backwards from the outcome, Diamond could easily defend his theory. I feel that Diamond ignores too many important issues that really need to be considered, in order to make his theory complete. For instance, the absence of any form of acknowledgment for that *pure luck* ought to have played a significant role in where we ended up, and second, that the author completely eliminates the human factor. For example China chose to isolate itself, thereby loosing the technological advantage it had acquired. That had absolutely nothing to do with geography. By ignoring factors such as the human variables, I believe Diamond has significantly twisted the history of human progress.<br />Having dashed out a fair bit of criticism, I must admit that I enjoyed very much reading this book. Diamond knows a whole lot about a whole lot of things, and while reading this book I had many \\"Aha! So that's why!!\\" or \\"Really? Interesting!!\\" - moments.. I learned a lot from this book, and I will for sure cite this book in the future!<br />I do recommend it to any reader whom wants to better understand the world we have inherited.

The protagonist of Ha Jin's \\"Waiting\\", Lin Kong, is a Chinese Army doctor who is trapped in an arranged marriage. His wife, Shuyu, a simple and uneducated woman with \\"a country way\\" of being, although the most embarrassing thing of it all, is that she has bound feet.<br />Yet, Lin is happy with his organized military life working for the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Muji City, while his wife and daughter is staying back in Goose Village. But then he falls in love with Manna Wu, one of the nurses working at the hospital. Being in an arranged marriage Lin has always been dreaming of true love and romance. And together with Manna he experiences the sensations of love for the first time.<br />All of a sudden Lin find himself caught between two completely different worlds. A life with his uneducated wife in the rural countryside of Goose Village or with Manna, an educated beautiful woman, in Muji City. He is trapped by a culture in which adultery (if caught) will ruin your both your life and career. The rules are though, you can obtain a divorce automatically only after 18 years, so his only hope is that his wife will agree to a divorce. So, year after year, for his holiday, Lin returns to his village to ask for a divorce, and year after year he returns from his vacation to the city and Manna, still married, still not able of consummate his relationship with her. When Lin, after 17 years, finally is granted a divorce, he finds that things don't turn out the way he thought they would. (You know what they say \\"Wanting what you can't have - the essence of wanting..)<br />All those years of waiting and waiting... A nice twist to the story is when we in the end realize that it's not Lin's waiting for true love that inspired this book's title, but the waiting his wife Shuyu and daughter endured until Lin returned to them.<br />I simply adored this book. I am not sure what I was expecting, but this book took me by complete surprise! I read it in fifty-page gulps, completely fascinated by the story and its beautiful, beautiful prose. I found myself hypnotized by Ha Jin's spare and economical prose. A style I've come to like through authors such as Coetzee and Hemingway, and at times \\"Waiting\\" is a bit Hemingway-esque. Despite the economical prose, the story is rich and characters are beautifully developed.<br />\\"Waiting\\" is highly deserving of the \\"PEN/Faulkner\\" and \\"National Book Award\\" it won. This bittersweet novel will linger on your mind for a long time after you've finished it. It was the first book I read by Ha Jin, but I am already looking forward to his next book.<br />Highly recommended!etely fascinated by the story and its beautiful, beautiful prose.

I had heard quite a lot about his past work, so I was looking forward to reading the book. As always when you read a novel by a &quot;new&quot; author, it takes a few pages before you understand the author's style. I quite liked his way of writing from page one.<br />We enter the story in London in the 1930'ies. We are introduced to Christopher Banks, a rather (according to himself) famous detective. As we get to know him, we learn of his tragic background. Christopher was born in Shanghai. His Dad, a British businessman, was involved in the opium trade, and his mother on the other hand, was lobbying against the opium trade... As a 9-year old, both his parents got kidnapped under mysterious circumstances. First his dad, and then later his mom as well. When neither of them returned, Christopher got sent back to England. Here he tried to fit in the best he could, both in the British school-system and in life in general.<br />This novel is written entirely in first person tale. Very early in this book we pick up that the narrator, Christopher Banks, is a rather unreliable source for information. He has a somewhat &quot;selective&quot; memory. Where his old classmate remembered him a an &quot;oddball&quot; - Christopher denied that, saying &quot;You must mistake me for someone else..&quot; (Remembering himself to have been &quot;one of the boys&quot;... and getting along well with everyone). <br />As an adult he is still troubled by his parents disappearing. He decides to return to Shanghai to try to find his parents. <br />Up until this point I have enjoyed the story. But from here.. <br />The story starts to derail, and it falls completely apart as we hear Christopher describing how he is walking around in the war-zone (bullets whining past him here and there) accompanied by his long lost Japanese friend, Akira, searching for the house where his parents are believed to be held hostages. And thenovel looses every little tad of hope I had, when his &quot;uncle&quot; is revealing to us what really happened when his parents disappeared. It just got too unbelievably. Rather unfortunate, in this novel, Ishiguro's ability as a storyteller doesn't quite match his ability as a writer. <br />So even if I am not too excited about this novel, I have also bought &quot;The Unconsoled&quot;.

Technically it is about a man dying, yet it teaches you how to live. And the lessons taught in this book are all beautiful!<br />We meet Mitch Alblom, a sports writer for the Detroit Free Press and his old professor from college, Morrie Schwartz. Mitch and Morrie had an unusual close relationship while Mitch was in college. On his graduation day Mitch gave Morrie a very nice leather briefcase. Morrie had tears in his eyes, when he asked \\"Will you stay in touch?\\". Mitch promised to do so. A promise he did not keep.<br />And it wasn't till 20 odd years later, now, a somewhat famous (at least well known) sports-writer, he is in a hotel, zapping through the different TV stations, that he sees his old professor on a TV-show; Nightline with Ted Koppel. He is now an old man, just diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease). [This a neurotical disease, which slowly kills you. First you loose your balance, then the ability to walk, next you cannot lift your legs, then the arms and at last it hits the lungs and you suffocate.]<br />Mitch decides to pay his old college teacher a visit. This is the start to what will be their weekly meetings. For each \\"class\\" they set a topic to discuss (death, family, marriage etc.). My favourite scene from the book is at the end, when we all know that Morrie will soon die, and Mitch and Morrie are saying goodbye. Reading this, I just gave up on holding back the tears.<br />I laughed and cried my way through this book, and my only complaint is that the book isn't longer. I have had (still have) my own Morrie (Ms. Syring, from the Norwegian School of Management). I know for sure that I wouldn't have made it through college without her. So, when I found this book, I knew I had to buy her one as well.<br />We both recommend this book!	2001-11-25

I read the book in 50 page gulps at a time...<br />We meet Candice Shapiro, a 28-year old reporter working for Philadelphia Examiner. She has announced to her boyfriend of three years, Bruce Guberman, that she wants a break from their relationship. We enter the story as she has just received a phone call from her friend, Samantha, asking if she has read *the* article. The article her friend is talking about is Candice's ex-boyfriend, Bruce's, new column in the magazine \\"Moxie\\" - \\"Good in Bed\\". This month's subtitle: \\"Loving a larger woman\\". An article full of juicy, very private, details, referring to Candice as \\"C\\". The \\"black belted\\" version of Public humiliation! So, there she is, having a mental breakdown at work, while her obnoxious co-worker is staring at her, savouring each second of Candice's misery.<br />We follow Candice through the monthly humiliating articles that Bruce writes, the weight loss group sessions, the hunt to get Bruce back, and when that doesn't work, the struggle to get her life back on track, preparations for motherhood (of course she got pregnant after the only \\"quickie\\" she and Bruce had after breaking up).<br />This book has plenty of interesting characters; some are easier to identify with than others... My favourites are Candice's sister Lucy, and Tanya, the girlfriend of Candice's mother. (They are my favorites, although I have little in common with them..) Of course, Doctor K is sweet as well.<br />This book is an entertaining, easy read, and I must admit that I at times forgot at this was just fiction. The Hollywood part reminded me that it was... Having said that, this is a great story, sweet, tender, humorous, super funny - all that at the same time.<br />You could easily say this is just another \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\"-book.

If I only knew what kind of treat that was waiting for me, I sure would have started reading it right away! As soon as I started reading this book, I was hooked. I read it just a few sittings, completely fascinated by Bruce/Brenda/David's history.<br />We meet the twins Bruce and Brian and their parents, Ron and Janet Reimers from Winnipeg, Canada. The twins did, at 7 months old, have problems urinating. Janet takes them to the doctor, and they decide that to avoid more infections/problems, the twins should be circumcised. And it is during this routine procedure that the disastrous accident happens - the doctor burns off little Bruce's penis. [The tragic irony is that his twin brother, Brian (who, of course after what happened to Bruce, did not have the operation), got well after a few weeks, and never experienced similar problems later...] So, what was to be a \\"5-minute routine operation\\" is now turned into a disaster for the young, and not very well educated, couple (just turned 19 and 20). They now have to decide what to do. Surgical (very painful) operations to rebuild what's left of Bruce's penis (very little or nothing), or the later introduced option - a full sex change (castration, removal of his male organs, and surgically making a vagina) and raise the boy as a girl. Although sceptical to the procedure, the medical expert Dr. Money manages to convince the young couple that Bruce will be better off as Brenda, and that s/he will grow up as any other girl with the exception of having children of her own. The parents follow Dr. Money's directions one hundred percent, and then some. Brenda always dressed in girly clothes, encouraged to play with dolls etc. But already at a very early stage it is quite clear that Brenda is, at best \\"tomboyish\\", and more \\"boyish\\" than her quieter twin brother, Brian. At age 14, Brenda decides to live as a boy. S/he starts the painful procedure of reversing the effect of the estrogens s/he had been forced to take for a couple of years.<br />Bruce/Brenda/David suffered so much growing up. More than we can ever imagine. Sadly, much of it because of the medical expert, Dr. Money. An arrogant doctor who let his pride and career get it the way for common sense. He wanted to prove his theory no matter what price his patient(s) had to pay.<br />\\"As nature made him\\" is one of the most provoking books I have read in a long time. Thanks to David's unbelievably strong spirit this book has a happy ending. I am not going to say that I know how much he has suffered. Because I don't - and I never will.

In the end this book won the Booker Price.<br />The author has chosen an interesting approach to this novel. There are many stories in the story, and to confuse us even more the author chose a flashback narrating style. We enter the story in the 1990'ies as the young woman named Rahel returns to her village (in a small town in Kerala, in India) to be reunited with her twin brother Esthahappen (shortened Estha), whom she hasn't seen in many years. (That being said, the story in \\"God of Small Things\\" is set for the most part during the 1960'ies.)<br />Two of the lead characters are the fraternal twins Estha and Rahel. They are bonded (unusually) close, so close that they think of themselves as \\"Me\\", and when separated as \\"We\\" or \\"Us\\", this to their family's great frustration. Told from the childrens' point of view, the story centers on the story of the twins' childhood, the tragic death of their English cousin, why Estha stopped speaking, to mention something, but not too much.<br />There are many interesting characters in this book, and several of them has a great potential, such as Grandma Mammachi, Grandaunt Baby Kochamma, the handyman Velutha (another important character), Ammu etc. Unfortunately, with a few exceptions, few of them are very well developed.<br />It is not often I almost put a book away (I have a thing for \\"must finish\\" what's been started), but this one I almost gave up. Arundhati Roy's prose and writing style is unusual, and I found it charming (in small doses) and I enjoyed this novel for its' prose more than for the story.  I was never sure where the author was headed with the story. This left me confused. On top of that, I am sure that I missed some of the metaphors, as well. Come to think of it, the same thing happened when I read Rushdie's \\"Satanic Verses\\". Maybe it is just me not getting the Indo-English writing style?ing the Indo-English writing style?	2001-11-25

I picked up this one in a second-hand bookstore in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. What an odd place for such a book, and what a treat it was for me!!<br />I have many friends from the US, and I have over the years heard they mentioning of \\"AA-programs\\". Some of my friends are positive to the AA-programs while others are against them. I must confess that I have absolutely no first-hand experience on this topic at all. I have the \\"preferred\\" skin-color, and also I'm living in Norway - which is one of the more advanced countries when it comes to equal opportunities - equal pay etc. Therefore, in the past, I had little to contribute with when the topic was discussed. And lack of knowledge was probably my strongest motive for reading \\"Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby\\".<br />One would think that a serious topic as Affirmative Action really is, would make a dry and rather verbose book. But Dr. Carter has an easy writing style, combined with his personal anecdotes - \\"Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby\\" was an entertaining read! I greatly enjoyed the book from page one. It was too good to put down, so I finished it in a few long sittings.<br />After reading this book, I have a better understanding on how the different AA-program works. And I must admit that I side with the ones of my friends whom are against such programs. This, simply because I truly believe that \\"color-blind is best\\". Treat everyone as individuals, and stop the stereotyping, and the building up under the belief that minorities cannot compete in a level playing field. For example, when American universities admit Blacks, Hispanics or others with lower exam scores than the rest, it is a waste of resources. They are more likely to follow the trend with lower test results than the rest, to not pass the exams, or fail to graduate at all (Thomas Sowell \\"Race and Culture - A world view\\", 1995). If any minority group be it Blacks, Hispanics or others, score lower than other groups, the recourses should be put in to improving the schools rather than telling them (the minorities) they do not need to meet the same standards as others. I can of course never completely comprehend or understand the terrible injustice and the endless frustrations that the minorities must have suffered, as I believe you have to have \\"walked in their shoes\\" to do so. But I am at least much more knowledgeable when discussing the topic.<br />After reading the book I passed it on to my friend, Rosa. She is living in US, but her parents moved from Puerto Rico to US some 30 years ago. She too, finished the book in a sitting or two, and she passed it on to her mother who was visiting from US. Both Rosa and her mother could perfectly well identify with Dr. Carter's book. I can never imagine what it is like to feel the doubt of colleagues to whether my success was achieved because of my race (and thereof by the privileges granted under an AA-program) rather than merit. But according to what Rosa told me, that is something all minorities has to live with. I am sure she knows what she is talking about, being a highly successful woman teaching (and doing her Ph.D.) at one of the best universities in Chicago. Another (black) friend of mine (also very successful) says \\"..My SAT-score was way above the score required, and I would have been admitted to the West Point Academy even if I was polka-dotted. But I am so used to the accusations of me achieving what I have achieved due to my skin-color rather than to my merits, to the point where that I am not even offended by it anymore...\\"<br />\\"Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby\\" is a book that taught me many things, and it should be required reading for everyone.<br />It is a book that leaves you thinking - which is not necessarily a bad thing...d be put in to improving the schools rather than telling them (the minorities) they do not need to meet the same standards as others.

And as always, Toni Morrison's prose is beautiful, subtle, and unique.<br />\\"Beloved\\" is set after the end of the Civil War. It is the story of Sethe, a woman and mother of four, escaping slavery finding her way north, to Ohio. Here she settles with her teenage daughter, Denver. Their house is haunted by a ghost. It is the spirit of Sethe's dead baby girl, a baby which Sethe killed many years ago... Morrison is a masterful storyteller, but nevertheless, expect to be a little confused in the beginning. Just continue to read - you can always go back and re-read the beginning later. The way this book is written with all the back and forth in time, we get to know the characters quite well, to the point that you feel that they are old friends of yours.<br />I have to admit to that although I think, \\"Beloved\\" is a great read, I don't think it is her masterpiece (I think that \\"Song of Solomon\\" is her best novel) but \\"Beloved\\" is certainly worth reading!!	2001-09-06

An amazing career that should include winning the Nobel Prize in Literature, and earn the praise as one of the greatest American writers ever.<br />\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" was my third novel by Hemingway, (the two other being \\"For whom the Bell tolls\\" and \\"The old man and the sea\\"). After reading some of the reviews here, I find that either you love this novel (and Hemingway) or you don't. But even if you don't particularly care for Hemingway, I think there are things in \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" that you could enjoy, be it bull fights or Paris in the 20'ies.<br />I have to confess that I only started reading Hemingway last year, yet he's become one of my very favorite authors. I love his spare, almost brutally economic writing style. Hemingway uses such a simple language, yet one feels it as the richest ever.<br />The setting of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is in Paris in the 1920'ies. A bunch of rich kids, American and British expatriates, (\\"the lost generation\\") who fought in WWI, are now doing little but strolling around the streets of Paris, looking for a nice restaurant to eat and drink, or attending the \\"occasional\\" party. If they are not clubbing/partying, they are traveling around. What a nice life!<br />Hemingway lived for many years in Paris and also spent much time in Pamplona, Spain, which of course has contributed to the spot-on accurate, realistic account both geographically, and also from the life of expatriates and social events happening.<br />This is a classic masterpiece, ready to be re-read anytime!	2001-09-06

It provides us with a fine introduction to the ex-president's private and public life. The book is very detailed in exploring Carter's childhood and early political career. Although I found that part interesting to read, I wish it had been as detailed on the account of his presidency. As a born-again Christian there is no doubt that morality played (and still plays) a major role both in Carter's private as well as public life. Unfortunately, strong moral and ethics is not enough to make a good leader and president (I think Bill Clinton is the best example on that...)<br />President Carter endured the lowest poll ratings ever to be recorded. And after leaving office he spent years as America's favorite guy to pick on. He dedicated himself to volunteer work, especially working with the organization \\"Habitat for Humanity\\". More than a decade would pass before he again, in the mid-90'ies, would enjoy life in the public limelight. In 1994 Atlanta Georgia, he got his (long overdue) tribute in bronze, his public ratings was again soaring, and he received invitations to join peace negotiating teams etc.<br />\\"Jimmy Carter - American moralist\\" (together with Powell's \\"My American Journey\\") was my introduction to reading about American politics and history. In this book, the author strikes a perfect balance between political jargon, facts and figures. And the result is a biography easy to read, even for lay readers like me. I learned a lot from reading this book, and it inspired me to continue to explore the field further.<br />An interesting biography!	2001-09-06

I decided to read \\"The color of oil\\" as an introduction to the oil-industry. The authors (Economides and Oligney) are both \\"oil-guys\\", so I was a little skeptical to what level the language would be on. But fear not, the book is kept on an accessible level, even for the lay reader.<br />The authors explains why and how vulnerable the industry is, about the more resent but also the past oil-crisis, how little it takes for the oil-price to spin out of control, governmental interference and how the politics in the industry works (or don't...) etc. Together with this comes, quite naturally, a large dose of American history.<br />To the authors' credit, they strike the perfect balance between facts, technical jargon, and personal anecdotes, which makes \\"The color of oil\\" an easy and entertaining read. I found it to be a great overview over the industry. I picked up lots of new facts from this book, and I am most certain that I will cite this book in the future.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to fill in (or update) on the knowledge of the oil industry.	2001-09-05

We meet the 11-year-old black girl Pecola Breedlove, and her world - filled with hatred and racism. Her story is not a happy one - her brothers have run away from home, and her drunkard father has sexually abused her. Pecola believes that if she only had blonde hair and blue eyes, all her other problems will go away'<br />The characters are all very well developed, and one has to care deeply for them. The symbolism is easy to understand, and Morrison's prose is beautiful, subtle, and unique.<br />This is a novel that leaves you thinking, wondering about the world we live in.<br />Toni Morrison has quite rightfully won both the Pulitzer and the Nobel Prize. 'The bluest eye', was the third novel I read by Toni Morrison. Honestly, 'The bluest eye' is not her masterpiece (I think that the book 'Song of Solomon' is her best novel) but it is certainly worth reading!<br />An enjoyable read!	2001-08-28

But the author came highly recommended from my friend so I expected to be in for a treat.<br />This novel has a fantastic opening - the protagonist Joe Rose, a journalist, has brought his girlfriend/lover Clarissa, to the countryside to celebrate her return from the US. While they are there, enjoying their picnic, they witness a tragedy, as a man falls dead to the ground from a helium balloon. Jed Parry, one of the other witnesses to the tragic accident, becomes obsessed with Joe. Jed starts to stalk Joe, believing that they share some extraordinary link and that the two of them are bound by love.<br />So, what started out as a tragic accident is soon turned into familiar McEwan style, with relationships, science, religion and psychological obsession as some of the elements he touches upon. Unfortunately, this novel doesn't keep up with the expectations brought upon us from its amazing opening. Fair enough, I found &quot;Enduring Love&quot; at times unbearable in its suspense and hard to put down, but I was never completely captured by the characters.<br />More strongly recommended are the other McEwan novels &quot;The innocent&quot; and the Booker Prize winning &quot;Amsterdam&quot;.	2001-08-18

The whole family packs up and they get ready for the better life in Florida, where Bob will be working in a liquor store owned by his rich brother Eddie. But in Florida the things don't turn out quite the way Bob expected. The fast cash comes Bob's way, but it's not like what he expected so he soon (again) finds the situation boring. Just to complicate things further, he takes on yet another mistress, while at the same time his wife is pregnant with their third child. On top of this he experiences a robbery at work with a tragic ending to it. Bob not being a very strong person, is soon pushed over and he soon looses control over the situation. So what was once a dull and boring life is now left to be controlled by forces totally out of Bob's control.<br />The other parallel story, is the story of the young, struggling Haitian woman, Vanise Dorsinville and her nephew Claude, both illegal immigrant to US, in search for a better life and the American Dream.<br />Banks has created a realistic and interesting mix of characters with whom we can easily relate to.  Spanning from the very simpatico, likable protagonist Bob with a great moral, to Bob's not so charming brother, Eddie -racist, vulgar, and without scruples.<br />At first I was a bit frustrated with this book, as I had failed to realize that in the first part of the book it is two parallel stories that we are following. The stories are not tied together until the latter part of the book. But now you know, so you won't be making the same frustrating effort to understand the connection between the characters in the first part of the book...<br />This was my first novel by Russell Banks, and after reading this - I immediately went out and bought \\"Cloudsplitter\\" and \\"Affliction\\" as well..<br />A great read!	2001-08-18

Every story with the touch of Indian customs and traditions.<br />One of my favorite stories is the closing story 'The third and final continent' where we meet the 36 year old Indian man who follows the tradition of arranged marriage. He married a woman chosen by his older brother, and then left her after a week to go to Boston. She was to stay back for 6 weeks and then reunite with her husband in US. This a story about his quest, his struggle in a new world, and of course' how him and his wife stopped being strangers, how their life came about in this huge, strange country (US).<br />This story ends like this:<br />-- 'While the astronauts, heroes forever, spent mere hours on the moon, I have remained in this new world for nearly thirty years. I know that my achievement is quite ordinary. I am not the only man to seek his fortune far from home. And certainly I am not the first. Still there are times I am bewildered by each mile I have traveled, each meal I have eaten, each person I have known, each room in which I have slept. As ordinary as it all appears, there are times when it is beyond my imagination.' --<br />Compelling! This is probably the strongest and most beautiful ending I have ever encountered in any story!<br />Another notable standout is &quot;This blessed house&quot; - the story about the young couple, Twinkle and Sanjeev, recently married after a very short courtship. After moving in to their new home, they discovers almost daily crucifixes, cards and other Christian objects/symbols that the previous owners left. These finding are made to Twinkle's great pleasure, and to Sanjeev's increasing frustration. Needless to say this takes its' toll on their relationship... Very funny!<br />Lahiri's excellent prose and the beautiful stories make this into an immensely readable collection, even though it is an all too quick read. I can't wait until her next work is being published.<br />Highly deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.pleasure, and to Sanjeev's increasing frustration.

This play, together with &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, was my introduction to real reading. Previous to reading this book, I had kept to what I will call &quot;easier&quot; reading.<br />&quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; was assigned to us by our English teacher, as part of our undergraduate English class. Our teacher, Mrs. Syring, knew this play by heart. She pointed out the subtleties in this play for us (you can't expect too much from a bunch of accounting students..) and she made us understand what kind of outstanding literary attack on the American society and the American dream this play really is.<br />The protagonist, Willy Loman, is a committed, hard working, aging, middle class man, with a dream to be rich and successful. Making it &quot;big&quot;- just like the American dream. Unfortunately, Loman is neither rich nor very successful. And in the end, Loman commits suicide, (wrongfully) thinking that his family will be just as happy without him, living well off the insurance money.<br />This play is a classic portrayal of what kind of tragedy the pursuit of the American dream can bring to a man and his family.<br />The play is written some sixty years ago (written in 1949), but I don't think this play will ever be outdated. Wonderfully written, with an important moral lesson for all of us to remember.	2001-08-12

He has been very successful in the past recommending good books, but this time, after reading a couple of hours, I questioned his recommendation. Having said that, the story really picked up after a while, and it became impossible to put it down!<br />The setting is post-War Berlin. The twenty-five-year-old male lead, Leonard Marnham, is being assigned to a British-American intelligence team. This international plot, &quot;Operation Gold&quot;, is never fully disclosed to anyone, so everyone associated with this project works under the &quot;need to know&quot;-basis. Marnham uses his secret work to get away from his rather ordinary life, and of course, to loose his highly unwanted innocence.<br />&quot;The innocent&quot; has something that everyone can enjoy; elements of espionage, Cold-War paranoia, confusion, romance and drama. Everything mixed together into a story, like nothing I've ever read before.<br />&quot;Operation Gold&quot; did exist in real life. According to &quot;Author's note&quot; on one of the last pages in this book, &quot;Operation Gold&quot; was a joint CIA-MI6 venture, that operated for just under a year, until 1956. This of course, made the whole thing much more real and believable.<br />Ian McEwan is a masterful storyteller, and after reading four of his books, I am a great fan of his books!<br />This is a great read!<br />(If you like this one, I suggest you also read the Booker Prize winning &quot;Amsterdam&quot; and also &quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot;.	2001-08-12

One of them, a woman is standing there, singing, and another woman entering labor - to the ending, this book held my full attention. I just could not put this book down!<br />In telling this beautiful story, Morrison cleverly mix together elements of magic, myth, and folklore. The style of the book reminds me of the book \\"One hundred years of Solitude\\" by Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez.  Both novels share many similarities, and they are books which you have to \\"think\\" while reading them.<br />The characters in \\"Song of Solomon\\" are each very well developed. It is almost as if you know them all personally and one cannot help but to care deeply for them all. This is the only book I have read by Toni Morrison that features a male lead. I wouldn't know, but based on the opinion of other reviewers on Amazon.com Morrison masters the task of \\"being male\\" perfectly well.<br />\\"Song of Solomon\\" is considered to be Toni Morrison's masterpiece, and the novel is one of my all-time favorites.

I only started reading Hemingway last year, yet he's become one of my very favourite authors. Of course I am humble enough to I ask myself &quot;What more is there to say about &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; that the reviewers and others haven't said already?&quot; Yet here I am... writing another review about Hemingway's masterpiece...<br />&quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; is the tale of two of man's most cherished and hated traditions: Love and War. We enter the story somewhere in Spain, in 1937, under the Spanish Civil War. We follow Robert Jordan -the American (teacher, now a demolition expert), and a group of guerrilla loyalists; Pablo leader of the group, his woman Pilar and the girl Maria (a prisoner rescued by Pablo).<br />We follow the group, and especially Robert's, effort, fighting for the Republic against the Fascists. The entire novel only covers a span of three days, so we truly get a sense of the time passing. While the story develops we recognise that the real leader of the group is not Pablo, but his woman, Pilar. We watch Robert develop an intense love for the girl Maria and reading the part where Robert and Maria are taking farewell brought tears to my eyes...<br />It is not possible to not genuinely care for each individual in the story, because the characters are few, and they are all very well developed. In fact, they must be the most complete characters that I've found in any novel that I've read. They say that good novelists write books with strong main characters. Great ones make even the minor characters memorable. And so it is with &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, the old man Anselmo is as well developed as Robert Jordan or Pilar.<br />From beginning to end, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; held my attention. This novel shows Hemingway's masterful command of the English language, and I think this novel is one of the best anti-war novels of the 20th century. &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; most definitely deserves its &quot;true classic&quot;-label.<br />I couldn't recommend it more highly!quot;true classic&quot;-label. <br />I couldn't recommend it more highly!	2001-08-02

Dr. Sowell discusses the impact of the cultural differences, and how these differences have been a determining factor for the direction that the different societies in our world have taken, and the degree of success/failure they have experienced.<br />When I bought this book, I was most curious to the chapter on &quot;Race and intelligence&quot;. Here Sowell brings up whether it exists a racial, genetic difference in the innate intelligence. It is evident to the reader that Sowell done a considerable amount of research on the topic. His research comes across as both balanced, and well argued. Sowell does present us with IQ test-results which, as I see it, are flirting with the &quot;race&quot;-line, but at the same time he points out that these results changes dramatically over time. After all, immigrants to the US has proven to be economical prosperous regardless of how they scored on the intelligence test. Actually, how I understood it, the test proved that a high (low) score was absolutely no guarantee for success (failure). This again proves that not genetics, but rather traits such as cultural capacity to adapt to new environment, and the inherited traditional values that are the essential factors to success (failure).<br />I am a firm believer that the standardized tests do not measure innate, but rather what I would call performance intelligence. Sure, a pore black boy with no education nor an academic environment supporting him, will naturally (and expectedly) score lower on a standardized test, than a rich white kid that has taken every &quot;prep-class&quot; available, that has had private teachers all his life, member of the chess club etc. etc. But here they are comparing oranges and apples.

He seeks advice with a fortuneteller and she gives him the advice to go to where his dream urge him to go. Later he meets an old, strange man whom says he is the King of Salem. The old man can read Santiago's thoughts, and he also recommends the boy to leave his safe life as a shepherd and rather follow his dream.<br />This is the start of a long journey of transformation and discovery. The boy doesn't have an easy time while he follows this heart, he is constantly being tested, but at the same time he has the joy of knowing his life is well spent while following his heart and living his history. To no surprise he does achieve his dream in the end. The surprise is how it happens.<br />\\"The alchemist\\" presents a simple fable, based on simple truths with extremely powerful messages. It is a book about finding your path in life and to have the courage to follow your dream, and to understand the signs as you journey through life. What you will notice while reading this book is that very little of what's presented is new to any of us, but then again, that is not the point of a fable either. The author simply reminds us of the things that we already know. Follow your dream, and live your history!<br />\\"The Alchemist\\" is a short book (&lt;150 pages), and you'll finish it in a setting or two. It is probably one of the cutest books I have read, along with Steinbeck's \\"Of mice and men\\".<br />\\"The Alchemist\\" is a book we all should read once every year.e Alchemist\\" is a book we all should read once every year.	2001-07-22

The author possesses an amazing knowledge, both historical and geographical. While he is an academic and therefore at times goes into unnecessary detail or support of his arguments, he serves us the occasional entertaining anecdote, which makes this book both readable and funny.<br />To explain why the economic development in the world (from about 1500 to the present) has happened at different paces and with different degrees of success is not an easy task to undertake. To do so successfully is even harder.<br />Landes strongly advocates the point of view that cultural values, such as technology, thriftiness, work ethic, and women, are the primary factors of economic success or failure. I truly enjoyed reading the authors observations on the various cultures and their economic successes and failures (a little minus here is Landes tendency to lean on the cultural stereotype just a few too many times). I now have a better understanding for the importance of cultural values in the economic area. Why the UK fell behind the rest of Europe, or why China by deliberately choosing to isolate the country, lost their economical/technological jump-start on Europe. I also have a greater awareness of the effects of religion; that there can be little doubt that the religious-based repression/bias towards women will continue to slow the economic development and success of the societies in which this still occur.<br />There is an abundance of interesting and useful information in this book, and I did learn a lot of new facts from this book. Nevertheless, I am not sure that I am left with a better understanding of the key factors that drive economic success. I can't help feeling that I worked my way through the five hundred pages waiting for the &quot;little extra&quot; - that never came. So even if Landis handles the facts and analysis very well, I still miss is the one, grand theory that explains it all.<br />Bottom line, &quot;The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why some are so rich and some are so poor&quot; is a superb historical overview, but it doesn't quite deliver what it promises - the one theory that wraps up everything, and offers some insights to the question that we all ask ourselves: &quot;Why some are so rich and some are so poor&quot;.y well, I still miss is the one, grand theory that explains it all. <br />Bottom line, &quot;The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why some are so rich and some are so poor&quot; is a superb historical overview, but it doesn't quite deliver what it promises - the one theory that wraps up everything, and offers some insights to the question that we all ask ourselves: &quot;Why some are so rich and some are so poor&quot;.	2001-07-22

But I have to warn you; &quot;The End of History and the Last Man&quot; is not an easy book to read. It is not just badly written, but it is written in such a way that you end up reading the same points at least three times.. I commented this for my friend who recommended me the book, and he said: &quot;Yeah, that's right. I forgot to say that it is a bit wordy and repetitive. I should have recommended you something a little bit easier to read.&quot;<br />That being said, there is not doubt that Fukuyama possesses much knowledge on the subject, and I find some of the issues brought up in this book to be very interesting, even provoking. But after reading this book, I was left with the feeling of spending much time on acquiring very little (new) information.<br />Maybe one would be better off, doing what my friend suggested for me (of course, he did that *after* I had struggled my way through the book). Go to your library and find the original 1989 National Interest article - read that one, and skip the book. Apparently you'll get the same main ideas, without having to struggle through hundreds of pages..	2001-07-22

Alex Haley has written an excellent (auto)biography of one of Americas most fascinating leaders and \\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\\" is interestingly written entirely in first-person tale, something I truly enjoyed.<br />We get to follow Malcolm X and his family, from his childhood in Omaha Nebraska, via the streets and back allies in Harlem, Malcolm X in jail, and then after he converted, and became a Muslim and joined with Mr. Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. The final part of the book is about when Malcolm X went to Mecca and Africa where he underwent an amazing transformation and came back to America as a truly changed man. He no longer hated the white man, but instead, like he answered at a press conference:<br />-\\"My trip to Mecca has opened my eyes. I no longer subscribe to racism. I have adjusted my thinking to the point where I believe that whites are human beings\\" [a significant pause] \\"as long as this is borne out by their humane attitude toward Negroes\\"-.<br />It was the split with Mr. Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam, which resulted in his too early death, and that at a time when he was just coming to grip with whom he was, his own potential, and what his role should be. It breaks my heart reading how Mr. Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam went on smearing Malcolm X's reputation, even after his death. Mr. Elijah Muhammad even went so far to call him a *hypocrite*! Malcolm X might have been a lot of things, but a hypocrite he wasn't. But he *was* a man with a great portion of integrity, and in the end that was what got him killed...<br />My intention for reading this book was obviously to fill a few holes in my knowledge of American History. (And I have to admit that I knew very little of Malcolm X before I started reading this book). I was completely fascinated by the story of Malcolm X, and it soon became impossible for me to put the book down. This is a book that made me both laugh and cry. It is not often that I read a book, which so deeply touches my heart as this one did!<br />I finished this book with a deeper comprehension of the pain and distress the African American people has had to suffer through out history. This is book that has taught me many things and a book that I most certainly will refer to in the future. \\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\\" is a book that I will strongly recommend to anyone who is interested in History/Culture/Religion/America.

A true classic!	\\"Giovanni's Room\\" by James Baldwin is a beautiful novel about the struggling sexuality of a young American expatriate, David.<br />David is living in Paris, and while there, he meets Hella. David is quite determined to live a \\"normal\\" life, with wife, kids and all. But while Hella is away in Spain (\\"to consider David's proposal\\") David has an affair with the handsome Italian bartender, Giovanni.<br />Although the time setting of this novel is in the 1950's, \\"Giovanni's Room\\" is a timeless novel, and anyone regardless of time-period, can easily identify with the different characters.<br />Once I started reading this book, I found it almost impossible to put it down. Actually, I finished it in one long day...<br />In the 1950'ies it wasn't easy to be neither gay nor black. The author James Baldwin was both. I think he was immensely brave to write \\"Giovanni's room\\", especially since he did so, in a time when it was hard to be either one, black or gay. Some of the other reviewers said that \\"if you are not paying a lot of attention you probably wouldn't even know that the book is about homosexuality\\" - not to be disrespectful, although Baldwin's writing technique in this book is impressive, I have a hard time understanding how one could possibly avoid picking up that the book is about homosexuality...<br />Anyway, I think that \\"Giovanni's Room\\" is one of James Baldwin's best works, and I highly recommend the book!	2001-06-18

I only started reading Hemingway last year, yet he's become one of my very favorite authors. In this book, \\"The old man and the sea\\", he writes about a lonely old Cuban fisherman, Santiago, that goes out fishing, desperate to catch a big fish. A fisherman's crusade for final glory.<br />Santiago, the fisherman, is poor and his only friend is a young boy. The young boy used to be his fishing-buddy, but as the luck left Santiago, the boy's father asked the boy to go out fishing in someone else's boat.<br />We enter the story as Santiago has gone 84 days fishing without catching any fish. On the 85th day, alone in the boat, he manages to hook a huge Marlin, the biggest he's ever seen. A fish that is much stronger than himself. Santiago's effort and suffering are brought to us in such a way only Hemingway could do. Hemingway uses such a simple language, yet one feels it as the richest ever. We follow Santiago's fight with the huge Merlin, and his return to town after days of fighting, catching the fish. What happens on his way home is just heartbreaking... He succeeds, but only to lose it in the end.<br />Hemingway writes in such a way that you feel the pain of the fisherman struggle yourself, and you can nothing do but to love the old fisherman. \\"The old man and the sea\\" is a moving story, of a man with great persistence, and with a message to never give up.  Very highly recommended!<br />(If you like this book, I suggest you read Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\" too...)	2001-06-16

They say that no book in modern times has matched the uproar this book sparked... Honestly - I don't get it.<br />Salman Rushdie's \\"Satanic Verses\\" was a book that came highly recommended from my friend (He has it on his Top 3 list) so I was absolute certain that this was a book that I would enjoy. I started reading it, and to my surprise - I did not understand a thing!! I started over again four or five times just to make sure that I did not miss anything. I struggled through every page. Although I truly enjoyed Rushdie's lyrical writing style (the best I've ever read) I often felt that I did not get the big picture.<br />Both the culture gap and the lack of knowledge of the Koran/Islam made me miss out on a lot while reading this book. On a more personal more, not being Muslim, I was not offended and I also failed to see where the book could be offensive at all.<br />I suppose that if I read the book again, I might change my opinion about it..	2001-05-31

His childhood, his different jobs, his family and - my favorite- when he moved to France, and tried to learn French.<br />I love the story of his childhood, how he due to his lisp becomes a kid with an outstanding vocabulary (to avoid words starting with \\"s\\"), the story of his artistic career, and also his brother - \\"The rooster\\". But his story about moving to France and trying to learn French is amongst the absolute best.<br />I can perfectly well relate to his frustration trying to learn another language. I have done something quite similar, I went to Ecuador to study Spanish with only 7 words in my vocabulary (the numbers 1-4, thank you, please and Merry Christmas) so I found those chapters absolute hilarious. My favourite is when he is having trouble with singular/plural and to circumvent this he always buys more than one, no matter what it is. His boyfriend is getting upset about this and I love Sedaris' comment \\"Just wait until he sees the *CD-players* I have bought for his birthday\\"...<br />I have not read many books that have made me laugh as much as this one has. To my surprise, Sedaris and his story kept me completely hooked for the 270 pages.<br />This book makes you laugh - laugh out loud!	2001-04-24

Having said that, don't fool yourself by thinking that \\"One hundred Years of Solitude\\" is an easy read, because it is not! At least it is not an easy read to begin with, but hang in there - it is evidently worth the struggle! Make sure that you get an edition that has a family tree of the Buend&iacute;a family in front of the book. Ear-dog that page, as you will use it repeatedly while working your way through this book. I mean, how many Jos&eacute;s, Aurelianos, or Remedios can you possibly remember and/or distinguish between?<br />\\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" is the story of the small village `Macondo' hidden the jungle of Colombia. Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buend&iacute;a was the founder of this village, and it is the story of him and his family that keeps you spellbound through the 400+ pages.

If you have someone you care about in Colombia, you will drive that person (and yourself) crazy if you read this book!! (Unfortunately, I speak from experience.. *gentle smile*)<br />Nobel Prize winner Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez is best known for his beautiful classic novel &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;. &quot;News of a Kidnapping&quot; is very different from the other novels I have read of Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, but still very interesting and well written. If one were not familiar with the kidnappings that have occurred in Columbia, one might just believe this was just another brilliant novel by Garcia M&aacute;rquez.<br />&quot;News of a kidnapping&quot; is a true-life story of one of the evils of Colombia and Latin America. Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez writes about the kidnappings of Colombian journalists, and other well-known persons or their relatives, ten in total. &quot;News of a kidnapping&quot; is the story of how these people lived during their endless months in captivity. While held hostages they were not tortured nor abused, but just being away from their families and loved ones for many months and the lack of news from the outside world wore them out. The emotional suffering was made even worse by the attitudes of their abductors. One moment they could be very nice to them, and in the next moment they could be behaving like wild animals. Parallel to the memoirs of the imprisoned journalists, we follow their families and their anxiety; and the fight to have the ones kidnapped set free.<br />In Colombia people live in constant fear of being the next victim of kidnapping, or maybe even worse, that their loved ones will be. All too often we hear of famous athletes, celebrities, or other high profile people being held ransom for money or to achieve other political goals. That Garcia M&aacute;rquez has dared to write such a book is rather amazing, bearing in mind that he probably risked his life by doing so. This book will for sure change the way you look upon your personal freedom!<br />After finishing this book I realized that living in Norway is maybe not that bad after all. It is not the belly on earth, and not much is happening here, but Hey! maybe that's not so bad after all..book will for sure change the way you look upon your personal freedom! <br />After finishing this book I realized that living in Norway is maybe not that bad after all.

From his nervous start in 1987 to the \\"guru\\"-status that Greenspan enjoys today.<br />Woodward is our guide through an extraordinary inside look at the making of policy. We get a feel for the enormous power of the Federal Reserve and the great power that Chairman Greenspan has. (Very interesting reading - I had no idea that the decision making process within the Fed is such a chaotic process!!) Woodward explains the workings of the Federal Reserve in such a way that the lay reader is able to appreciate the effort of Greenspan and his colleagues. Together with the glossary on page 230-234 this book is a quick and entertaining read which touches on many interesting topics. This book is a good source as an *introduction* to Greenspan and the politics inside the Fed. On the flip side, with its' 200+ pages, this book cannot be more than a brief introduction to the Greenspan world. I don't think that the author goes deep enough into the material to give justice to Greenspan as a leader, to his economic skills, nor to his ability to carry out policy.<br />Something that always has troubled me with Woodward and his writing is that he does not cite his different sources! This means that I as the reader cannot decide for myself what kind of prejudice and/or bias that might be present in the material that he quotes in his books. This is something I find extremely annoying!<br />On a more personal note; I think it is strange how a \\"fling\\" in the White House can overshadow an event of such great magnitude like the potential meltdown of the world economic system in 1998 really was. The Fed's was desperate for attention, to the extent that Paul Kanjorski, democrat from Pennsylvania, suggested injecting some sex into the Fed's so that they could get more media attention!!<br />[A tip to the author/publisher: It would have made more sense to place the glossary pages *in front* in this book, rather than in the back where it is currently placed.

The Goodwins' are close friends with another family with two girls of similar ages. The Goodwins' have dreams of living a simple life on their family farm, but this dream is shattered by two serious tragedies. The first tragedy, when Alice baby-sits for her friend Theresa, and Theresas' youngest girl drowns, and the second one, when Alice is falsely accused by one of the kids at school of child molestation and she's put in jail. It is very easy to identify with Alice, as what happened to her could happen to anyone. It is quite moving to read about how Howard and the girls cope with having mom in jail, how Howard struggles to keep the farm, and the family together.<br />This is a well-crafted novel, and the author has done a good job of developing her characters as flawed, but on the whole good, respectable people who are able to survive and mature, although their lives have been profoundly altered by some dreadful misfortunes.<br />This novel was not what I thought it would be, and as soon as I accepted that - I found myself enjoying it!	2001-04-10

US	51036921	R23YF0KYSFKSH5	067976402X	877433184	Snow Falling On Cedars	Books	4	38	43	N	N	Excellent novel	\\"Snow falling on Ceidars\\" was my first novel by David Guterson. As always when I read a book by (for me) an unknown author I am a little extra excited. Gutersons' \\"Snow falling on Ceidars\\" did not disappoint me.<br />The story opens in a courtroom. Kabuo Miyamoto, a Japanese-American, has been arrested and is on trial for the murder of a local San Piedro fisherman. The core story follows the trial of Miyamoto, but the book brings in so much more. We get an interracial love story, a war story, and an unsolved mystery. All this is gradually and slowly unwrapped as the story about the people of San Piedro Island is told. Guterson has purposely chosen flashback as a way to tell the story to the different characters. An experiment that works quite well!<br />History has always fascinated me, and the topic on how the Japanese Americans was treated during World War II was especially interesting. I found the background information very helpful in understanding why the characters interacted with each other the way they did.<br />In summary this is a well-written novel, with realistic, flawed, sympathetic characters easy to identify with. At times very hard to put down.	2001-04-09

My daughter (11) received the first Harry Potter book &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; for Christmas in 1998. On our travel the next year she read the book 19 (nineteen!!) times. She got completely hooked! All I heard was Harry Potter this and Harry Potter that... At the end I was fed up, wondering what all this fuzz was about and I decided to read the book myself.<br />To my surprise I really enjoyed the book. The book put you in this wonderful imaginary world, filled with suspense and mystery. In Harry Potters' world we meet a constant battle between the good and the evil. There are not too many characters that could confuse children, and there are some very interesting twists in JK Rawlings' novel. This book was a pleasant escape from reality and a very enjoyable read.<br />Highly recommended!!	2001-04-02

I stumbled over the &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; almost by accident while backpacking around Latin America.  (Truth is, &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; was the only book the 2nd hand bookstore would let me swap my old book \\"I know this much is true\\" for, without charging anything extra. On a backpackers budget and running low on money, this was a good argument for choosing a book *smile*).<br />At first I thought, \\"There is no way I am getting through this 600 pages book\\"!! It seemed incredibly boring. Honestly, I feared the book would last for the rest of my trip! However, after struggling through about 150 pages or so I really got into it and after that I found it hard, if not impossible, to put down. (I actually read while I was having dinner at a restaurant with my boyfriend!)<br />I found myself to enjoy both the story of the characters (a missionary, his wife, and their daughters) as well as the political history lesson I got about the Belgian Congo. &quot;The Poisonwood Bible\\" gave me a better understanding of the politics of Africa and the difficulties of its people. I learned heaps about a lifestyle very different from mine, despite the fact that the story was built on fictional people.<br />If you can be patient and give the book some time, you will find that you enjoy \\"The Poisonwood bible\\".	2001-04-02

He is the living symbol of the American dream. Powell was born in Harlem, and grew up in South Bronx. His parents were hard-working immigrants from Jamaica. He went to school in New York, and later joined the ROTC.<br />\\"My American Journey\\" is a very well written biography. Together with lots of pictures from Powell's personal life, from his childhood in Bronx, and ending with his official career in the White House, the easygoing writing style makes this an interesting read. I truly enjoyed learning more about the Vietnam War and the bravery of the US soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War. Additionally, after reading what Powell and Schwartzkopf experienced during the Vietnam War, I can better understand Powell's Gulf goals and actions. Previous to reading this book, I did not have a lot of knowledge about Panama and the invasion, therefore I found this part to be very interesting too.<br />The book provides us with a great study of leadership, while it also is a good study of military history and politics. \\"My American Journey\\" is an excellent story and example that shows us what possessing a strong motivation and integrity can lead to. You certainly do not need to be an American to appreciate the positive attitudes and the message that Powell sends through his book.<br />I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read about an interesting life, leadership, military history, and politics.	2001-03-27

The Norwegian author Henrik Ibsen wrote an insightful play about marriage and the role of women in Ibsens time (19th century Europe). I am sure that \\"A dolls house\\" must have been a shock to the European society when Ibsen first published this book. He criticised the system that demoted women to mere property and this must have been an outrageous statement in a society where women didn't even have the right to vote!<br /><br />The author himself said that this play was about human rights, not women's rights. While I believe this to be true, I still have no problems understanding why the female rights groups says that \\"A dolls house\\" is about women's rights. Whilst this play was written over a hundred years ago, many of the issues about women discussed in \\"A dolls house\\" are still applicable today. I think Nora is a *great* role model for a woman of the new millennium!<br /><br />If you, like me, had to read this as a part of your college literature requirements, give it another try!<br /><br />It is a wonderful book.	2001-03-23

Bob Woodward's \\"Shadow - Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate\\" is an insightful book about how the Watergate scandal affected the presidencies of Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and Bill Clinton. Politics and scandals have gone hand in hand all through US history, but it was the Watergate scandal that became the example of scandal so great that it could actually cause the downfall of the US presidency.<br />In the first part of the book, Woodward discusses the effects after the Watergate scandal, and how it has influenced the oval office. The Watergate scandal obviously affected the two presidents closest in time, Ford and Carter, the most. President Ford, because he pardoned Nixon (and the uproar that followed doing so), and Carter, whose promise of change, his promise of total ethics [\\"I will never lie to you\\"], stood in great contrast to the scandals involving Bert Lance and Hamilton Jordan. Discussed is also the Reagan and Bush's Iran-Contra scandal, including all of the details and questions regarding what Reagan evidently knew (or didn't). The second half of the book is almost exclusively devoted to the apparently endless scandals and moral blunders of the Clinton Administration, with particular emphasis on the Lewinsky scandal. Quite frankly, the first and second half of the book are like two different books. I found the first part of the book to be incredibly interesting, and then the second part, to be... well, \\"just another Lewinsky book\\"... But I did find the details which shows us how the Clinton-Starr battle(s) turned personal to be very interesting (and frightening). Woodward shows us how the Independent council has almost become a monster of its' own, no longer controllable by any political branch or office! I give credit to Woodward for explaining this in a way so that the lay reader can understand how the Independent Council Act has affected the oval office.<br />My motive for reading this book was to gain a better understanding of the Watergate scandal. Of how the Watergate scandal has changed the political culture of Washington, changed the function of the presidency, and also what effect the Watergate scandal has had on the role of the press in the American society.<br />The two disclosures in this book that surprised me the most, were about Bush and his attitude regarding the 1991 Gulf War, and Reagan, and his loss of memory *while* he was still in office.<br />Overall the book is well written and a good read. But unfortunately, the book hardly touches on Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush, in comparison to the number of pages devoted to Clinton. Because of the number of pages devoted to the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal I ended up feeling that I got more gossip than political history, and therefore not full value for my money.derstanding of the Watergate scandal.

Coetzee is a splendid writer, and the book certainly deserves its Booker prize.<br />&quot;Disgrace&quot; is the story of David Lurie, the 52 year old professor of English, whom seduces one of his students. He gets caught, and partly through his own pride, he loses his job. After loosing his job, Lurie moves in with his estranged daughter who has a small farm and runs a boarding service for dogs in the countryside of South Africa. Here they experience a brutal assault, and while the grief and shame of the event should have brought them closer together, they're driven even further apart.<br />&quot;Disgrace&quot; ties together two stories: the first dealing with the difficulties of David Lurie, and the second dealing with the change in South Africa, with the end of apartheid. Coetzee's ability to link private pain to the complication of politics is excellent, and engaging.<br />This is a phenomenal book, timely and well written. We are introduced to a topic which those of us who are not South Africans, will probably never quite understand.<br />A great read!	2001-03-20

But I debated long and hard whether to buy it or not, because I thought that it would be a little bit too \\"mushy\\" for my male, engineer friend. What I found was that this book is for everyone!<br />\\"A beautiful mind\\" is a very well written science biography. It is thorough, carefully researched to the last, and insightful in an easy accessible way. It covers a number of interesting subjects: mental illness, mathematics and economics, life in the academic world, \\"behind the scenes\\" politics in the Nobel committee, and obviously the complex personality of John Forbes Nash Jr. The author, Sylvia Nasar, manages cleverly to link these contrasting worlds in a fascinating and easily comprehensible way, so you do *not* have to be a mathematician or a doctor to appreciate this biography.<br />The first part of this biography, focuses on the genius of John Forbes Nash, Jr. Achieving his doctorate at age 21 is very impressive! The middle part focuses on his mental illness, the downfall and \\"lost\\" state of mind. I found myself completely absorbed by this part of the book, and I kept wishing for Nash to get better. The last part of this fascinating book includes Nash's recovery, and also quite a bit on the intriguing world behind the Nobel Prize.<br />Recently I discussed this book with my former English teacher at University, and we agreed that the title \\"A beautiful mind\\" must be meant in an ironic way. Because, trust me, there is nothing really beautiful about John Nash. Read the book and you will see what I mean.<br />The one part that has been with me since I finished the book is the part where Nash comments on the work that got him the Nobel Prize. He says something like \\"If one suffers and recovers from schizophrenia, and then wins the Nobel prize for work done *after* the recovery, well *that* would be amazing\\" (..Referring to that his work was done before he got the diagnosis schizophrenic).<br />A great read!br />A great read!	2001-03-20

Over and over again...<br />Spalding Gray's \\"Sex, and Death to the Age 14\\" is autobiographical. Spalding Gray is funny, very funny, and a little... extreme. Sometimes you read and wonder if the author's fantasy is \\"running wild\\" or if he is flat out lying just to add the little extra to the story. But nevertheless, this is spot-on super-funny book, a book you can expect will crack you up, over and over again.<br />I am not giving away the story, but I can tell you that I found myself almost speed-reading though the pages, eagerly waiting for something that would crack me up (again). I read this book in big gulps at the time, and finished it in a few sittings. There are few books that I have read, that have truly made me laugh out loud. This is one of them.<br /><br />A super-funny book!<br />(If you like this one - I suggest you read David Sedaris' \\"Me talk pretty one day\\")	2001-03-16

My object for reading this book was that I wanted to learn more about the Vietnam War, what happened and why. I also wanted to understand more about the problems and turmoil that followed when the War was over.  Further, I realised the book would be a great source of information about the West Point Academy, something I wanted to learn more about since my friend had attended the Academy. (A discussion with the same mentioned friend about the Vietnam War had left no doubt that I had considerable gaps in my knowledge of both West Point and the Vietnam War).<br />I was completely fascinated with the story, and it soon became impossible for me to put the book down. I even wished for longer commute to work, so I could read more (I already have 1 hrs 20 min of commuting each way to work!). After I had finished the book I asked my friend \\"Was is really like that at West Point?\\" and he answered \\"The book gives a `pretty accurate' description of what it was like\\"..<br />The first part of this book is about the Academic life at West Point, and at times this part of the book is absolutely hilarious! It left me smiling and laughing for myself.. I love the way the author, Rick Atkinson, describes the different characters. I had no problems picturing the different events in my head and I finished the book feeling like I practically knew all these cadets. The latter part of the book is about the war and it's aftermath. This part of the book is incredibly moving. The author describes these young men's (and their families) trial and suffering so well that you almost feel it as if the pain was your own. This part of the book left me in tears more than one time.<br />I finished this book with a deeper comprehension of the pain and distress which Vietnam Veterans has experienced both while fighting for their country, and later returning home. Anyone interested in history, reading about the events and ideas that strongly influenced America in the latter part of the 20th century, should read this book. The words \\"Duty, Honour, and Country\\" will never mean the same to you after reading this book. It is not often that I read a book, which so deeply touches my heart as this one did!ts and ideas that strongly influenced America in the latter part of the 20th century, should read this book.

I have just returned to Norway after a year backpacking around in Latin America (of course accompanied by the Lonely Planet books). I do not claim to be an expert, but I know what I look for in a travel guide!<br />This edition of the LP Central America did not disappoint me. I used it, going from Panama to Guatemala by bus(!). It is up to date on the information, and as with all the other LP books it is easy to find your way around with it. It includes maps over the big cities, good information about the hotels, restaurants, places worth visiting, and time schedules for bus, train etc. You have to take into account that this is a guide that is meant to cover the whole Central America so naturally it is not as detailed as the guides for each country separate. It is good as an overall guide if you plan to go to more than one or two countries, as you would try to cut down on the baggage to carry around.<br />As for the prices for hotels and food, the book is fairly accurate.. It is hard to keep up with all the changes, especially in the Latin American economy, where the inflation is \\"somewhat\\" higher than in the rest of the world. So, for prices - if you are on a backpacker-budget, do your own research, or at least be prepared for changes! (We usually multiplied the prices in the book with 1,5 and that gave us a good indicator of what to expect).<br />You will find that if you are walking around with the LP book under your arm, many of the local people will approach you and ask you if you need help. Say yes - even if you don't need help! It is a great opportunity to get in contact with the local people!<br />This book is a must on your travel!	2001-03-02

Before reading this book, I had kept to what I will call \\"easier\\" reading.<br />\\"Catcher in the Rye\\" was assigned to us by our English Teacher, as a part of our undergraduate English class. Our teacher, Ms. Syring, knew the book by heart. She seemed to tell us each day what was coming next. At times, this was the most annoying thing that she could have done. Yet in the beginning while reading the book, her telling us what was to come kept our class interested. (Imagine teaching English litterature to a bunch of Accounting students!) I sat many hours on the train back and forth to school, reading the book, chapter after chapter. (And I have read the book many times since then..)<br />Holden is a character I can identify with. I surely believe that at some point in life, every single one of us goes through a stage such as Holden's. The book reflects on the different situations and insecurities many of us have, or will be facing, in life. J. D. Sallinger wrote the book in 1951, but Holden's struggle in life is as valid in 2001, as is was back then.<br />If you only read one book this year, make that this one!	2001-02-27

The only negative with this book (and the reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars) is that it was completely outdated on prices etc. Another thing (that goes for most of the travel guides) is that many of the hotels that are listed in the book has gotten so much (too much?) business so that the service is down to a minimum. This we found especially in Isla Mujeres where the price was the double of what the book said, and really lousy customer service, if any.	2001-02-17
