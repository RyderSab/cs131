Often a Rashomon approach changes the facts with each telling.  Witnesses to a car accident each report it differently.  One says a blue car jumped the light and hit the white car.  Another says the blue car had the light when it hit the white car...   <br /> <br />The magnificent thing about Pears's writing is how cleverly he handles the Rashomon approach.  In each telling, the facts remain the same.  There are new facts added, but the old facts remain constant.  The changes are in the perceptions of what the facts mean and how they are interpreted.  This is clever writing, indeed.  Especially since each evolution in fact building and interpretation is radically different but non-contradictory to that before.  It is fascinating to see how well he does this and is worth reading for this if nothing else. <br />	2004-09-17

You realize that a mountaineer doing thin air climbs accepts as fact that they will lose brain cells, that they will be likely at some point in their careers to lose fingers or toes. <br /> <br />This book relates a wonderful story of adventurous exploration.  The decade long search to identify the wreck is fascinating in and of itself.  While Into Thin Air took us to the highest point on earth, this book takes us to the outer envelope of deep sea diving.  And the risks below are just as significant as those above - narcosis; the bends... the death rate in diving is enough to give most people pause. <br /> <br />The author does a good job of conveying the allure of such a dangerous activity and combines that with a rousing good story. <br />	2004-09-17

The rediscovered and strangely disquieting Castle films seem all the more intriguing because of the director's mysterious disappearance and presumed death at sea. <br />The ideas presented in the book range from discussing film as art to the artist's relationship to his art to arts role and impact on society. Carrying the concept of \\"subtext\\" in film to new heights (or depths), the author cleverly discusses the \\"building\\" of movies, using film as a multi dimensional media. In many ways, this is closer to how DW Griffith created movies than recent generations of taping. <br /> <br />Creates a lingering effect - a deeply disturbing book <br />	2004-09-17

You will be stunned by the clues that are there from the beginning (starting with the opening paragraphs) and sprinkled throughout the text.  Over and over again, the answers are there - hiding in plain sight.<br /><br />Of all the Mary Stewart mysteries (and I have loved them all), this has long been my favorite.  I have always been drawn to questions of identity (from fictional characters like Josephine Tey's Bratt Farrar to Anna Anderson's claim to be Anastasia).<br /><br />This is a quiet book, haunting in it's depiction of loss - a grandfather's loss of a favorite granddaughter; a woman's loss of place and name; a lover's loss - of promises, of time; a man's loss of wife and health.  And a lost note, the delivery of which might have changed much of what ensued.<br /><br />The echoes of the past build and build until they crash resoundingly into the present and affect all of the lives of all of those around Whitescar.<br /><br />Read it through, and then re-read the first couple pages.

And later we look back on those times through the mist and embue them with a magic which seems to have disappeared from our lives.  <br /> <br />That last summer, that one perfect evening before the dawn of the war to end all wars was such a time. After the war, after the trenches, after it was all over, things were changed forever. The war swept away a generation of youth. And it swept away the life of the leisurely aristocracy. The world got busier, and louder. But for one perfect moment...  <br /> <br />The Shooting Party gathers together representatives from every generation and every class onto a large country estate for a shooting party which takes place on the eve of that great war. We see the hints of war and because we are looking back, we understand how fragile this time is and how soon it will end. The slaughter of the hunt resonates with the slaughter shortly to take place. And when one character (in the words of his wife) \\"overreaches\\" himself, the card house begins to tumble and we know that that time and place is gone forever <br />	2004-09-15

But Flinders Petrie was the first great archeologist. Analogous to Edward R. Murrow's preeminence to this day as the standard against which all newscasters are measured, Flinders Petrie set the standard and laid the foundations for modern archeology. Today, one can study the science of archeology and obtain a degree. One can specialize in the school of Egyptology. Major universities and museums fund archeological digs. None of this existed when Flinders Petrie first embarked for Cairo in the late 1800's with little more than a bag, homemade tools and instruments, and very little money. How he came to return to Egypt and later Palestine year after year; how the study of Archeology/Egyptology was established at University College; how the theories of dating strata by studying potsherds was developed is fascinating stuff. For anyone who has been captured by the romance of rediscovering lost civilizations, this book is a must. <br />	2004-09-15

And I was charmed, as I never expected that I would be. Soon thereafter, I read Henry & Clara - a novelization of real people and events.  <br /> <br />Henry and Clara Rathbone - two people who grew up together in the pre-civil war era. Henry went to war; was damaged by war. Clara fell in love - with Henry, with politics, with Washington. What would their story have been like without the war? By the time they came together in marriage, their interests and goals in life had diverged. Clara's interests drove them to Washington where she befriended the troubled Mary Todd Lincoln.  <br /> <br />Most beguiling are the descriptions of Washington as a small southern town. Clara crossing the square in front of her house to the White House across the street; meeting up with Robert Lincoln in the park. The carriage rides and salons. In that time, the President and family lived in and were part of a neighborhood .  <br /> <br />Look at any picture of a momentous event, of famous people. Who are the people in the background? The other people who were there? A hundred years from now, looking at a picture of the motorcade in Dallas, will we know that was Nellie Connelly in the car with the Kennedys? Henry and Clara were at the theater, in the box with the Lincolns that night when John Wilkes Booth struck. What happens to people who experience such trauma? People who, in memory, replay in slow motion the events of the evening until their lives resound with could have beens, would have beens, if onlys, maybes and guilty wishes coming true. Did I wish it? Did I want it? Could I have done something? Should I have done something? Did I even want to do something?  <br /> <br />It is a book about loss as much as anything else. Mrs. Lincoln lost her husband. The nation lost its innocence. Henry lost his way and finally lost his mind. Clara lost her dreams and finally lost her life. And what was the real trigger? The war? The assassination? Conflicting goals in the marriage? The sweep of events that was too momentous to survive? Who and what died in the theater box that night? I think it was more than just Lincoln <br />	2004-09-15

As a young woman in Victorian London, she was part of a literary circle that included Dickens, Thackeray, Carlyle, John Stuart Mills, Tennyson and others. Lucie made a living by translating books into English - but her greatest literary work was brought about by the circumstances that lead to her death. <br /> <br />Seeking out a hot dry climate in a search for a cure for her tuberculosis, Lucie traveled to Egypt in the 1860. And there, in a house built on top of one of the ancient temples of Luxor, she made her home. Unlike some colonial British who recreated a piece of England in foreign lands, Lucie embraced the culture and people of Egypt. And she was, in turn, embraced by the people she met. Noor a la Noor - Light of the Light - was the name bestowed upon her by the people whose lives she touched.

I saw the title and (in the self-righteous way only the very young have) pointed out how awful it was to have a book about killing mockingbirds.  I believe she commented that the book made that very point.    Ten years later I read the book myself.  And have done so several times since.  Once I read it while I was traveling in Germany, and was touched all the more since it is such a quintessentially American book.  A striking juxtaposition to read about the rural south of the 1930's while staying in the modern Berlin of the 1990's.    I grew up in the middle of California's San Joaquin valley - a flat expanse of fertile agricultural land.  We lived on the edge of the country-side with a cotton field bordering our backyard.  There were no sidewalks.  The summer days were hot and the heat carried over long into the evening.  And the kids of the neighborhood had a freedom to roam that would not be even considered today.  There was a house down the street that we were sure was inhabited by witches.  We braved it on Halloween, but threw away the candy lest it be tainted.    Harper Lee portrayed childhood in such an adept way that the games, fantasies and structure of imagination the children built are as familiar to a California girl today as they are to a child in Alabama in the middle of the depression.  I could identify with everything those children did, thought and said.  It is through a child's eye that the far more serious subject matter of the book is related.    So many things have stuck with me over the years.  Not just the central tragedy of Tom Robinson and the Ewell's. The familiarity of a school pageant.  The struggle to adapt to teachers who don't understand the cultural nuances of the class.  A heroic effort to overcome addiction as a matter of self and principle.  Sultry summer evenings.  Walking like an Egyptian.  The price one pays to learn and acquire values.  Trying to make Boo Radley come out.  Dill.  Calpurnia.  And, of course, Atticus.    I was always sorry that Harper Lee didn't write more.  Then I realized that she didn't need to.  She'd written a perfect book.	2004-09-15

History is full of examples of the scramble to the winning side - especially when the consequences of being on the wrong side are often fatal.  When Henry Tudor's troops killed Richard III at the battle of Bosworth Field, it was in no one's interest to align themselves with the Plantagenets.  The king was dead, long live the king.    And Richard was a monster, anyway.  Wasn't he?  The evil uncle.  The scheming hunchback who killed his innocent nephews.  A vile man who was involved in the murder of the saintly Henry VI.  Who was involved in his brother George's unfortunate encounter with the vat of malmsey wine.  A villain for the ages.    We have only to reconcile this with other information.  He led the vanguard of great armies.  Not usual for a crippled crookback.  He was entrusted by his brother with the rule of the whole of the north of England.  His personal motto was \\"Loyalty Binds Me\\".    And when he died, when it was certainly not in their interest to do so, the City of York read into the council minutes: \\"King Richard late mercifully reigning upon us was thrugh grete treason...piteously slane and murdred to the grete hevynesse of this citie...\\"    Sharon Penman's The Sunne in Splendour gives us an alternative reading of this history.  After all, history is written by the victor.  Henry Tudor was the victor and had no love of the previous reign.	2004-09-15

Built by her ancestor William Cecil, counselor to Queen Elizabeth I, Burghley is an impressive example of the stately homes of England. On the serious side, the author reminds us of how fragile our heritage is, and how quickly it can disappear. The cost of repairing and maintaining an opulent home built more than four hundred years ago is staggering. The annual roofing costs along could send the national debt of a small country soaring. Lady Leatham also discusses the debate between preservation and restoration. If you were faced with the choice of preserving (in its current dilapidated condition) an artifact used by Queen Elizabeth, or restoring it (so that the fabric is new - but now made of things untouched by the Queen), what would you do?<br /><br />The delight of the book is the humor. There is the evidence that someone had a great taste for gin and a great need to hide the bottles. The bedroom paintings which would not bring restful repose to most of us. The plumbing which would serve to frighten us when we are most vulnerable. A delightful book	2004-09-15

Plunging the court into black on the death of the Prince Consort, the Queen maintained full mourning until her own death forty years later. <br />This book brings to life the final days and subsequent funeral of the monarch who ruled longer than any other in English history. We see Victoria, old and failing, clinging to life. The doctors trying to balance Victoria's last wishes with those of her family. The family frictions as the clan gathers: the Prince, who had waited so long for the throne; the princesses about to lose precedence; Kaiser Wilhelm, a reigning emperor who loved his grandmama but was resented by aunts, uncles and cousins. And the people, waiting outside the palace gates for the next bulletin on the Queen's health. Victoria reigned for 64 years; many were born and grew to old age in her reign. The passing of the Queen was an epic event - literally the end of an era. <br /> <br />A fascinating behind the scenes look at the staging of a state funeral - a funeral for a woman who had devoted much of her life to funereal trappings.

I really don't have a problem with that.  I am all for anything which sparks an interest and might lead one to read or investigate further.  With no background or prior reading, I am skeptical that the average reader would seek out Kendall.<br />I was first introduced to the &quot;did he or didn't he&quot; debate through Josephine Tey's &quot;A Daughter of Time&quot; - certainly not a scholarly history, but great fun.  It got me into the debate.  I began reading as many books on Richard III and the Princes as I could find (including Kendall).<br />I am always interested in any theory an author wishes to make on the subject.  I did not buy Ms. Weir's conclusions - too many points I could argue a different way.  I would like to lean toward the revisionist theories.  Why?  Partly because I would find it a fascinating exercise to see how historical records and perception could be corrupted by time, politics and power.  After all, the Tudors DID have an enormous stake in the debasement of Richard III.  And I think there is reason to believe that Edward IV greatly trusted his brother, and that the city of York held him in high enough regard to make a very risky public statement to that effect after his death.<br />On the other hand, it must be admitted that it was during Richard's reign in which the Princes entered the Tower and disappeared from sight	1997-07-09

There was a Love Story - forbidden passions.  There was a War Story - the hopelessness of the trenches.  And there was a Voyage of Discovery - a person in the present rediscovering the past (the Love Story, the War Story) through conveniently found journals with personal repercussions.<br />The love story was presented in an almost visual way.  I could see that house, those rooms.  I knew those people, I could see the play of emotions on their faces - the small glances.  I could feel the weight of conventions and the lure of the forbidden.  The Love Story seized my imagination.  And then it faded.  Words unspoken.  Choices.  Choices I didn't wholly understand since the character had faded and the thought process was no longer shared.<br />I had thought that the Love Story would become intertwined with the War Story.  I didn't think that happened very successfully.  When the first book began to fade, we started the second book.  The second book, the War Story, was the most powerful.  Almost tactile.  The mud.  The fatigue.  The smells.  The apathy.  The hopelessness.  And, yes, the horror.<br />The weakest was the Voyage of Discovery.  I didn't feel the juxtaposition of current with past worked well in this case - it was jolting.  I don't mind at all figuring something out sooner than a character, as long as it is not a LOT sooner.  In this case, it was a WHOLE LOT sooner.<br />So a mixed review.  Beautiful written, wonderful prose.  Good plotting on two of the three distinct elements, but the segues where not as smooth as they might have been	1997-07-09

And thinking &quot;what if she is?  What if she is?&quot;  It was like a fairy tale - a lost kingdom, an unrecognized princess (okay, grand duchess).  This romanticized view was further enhanced by the Ingrid Bergman movie.  Is she?  Is she?  She is...?<br />My interest in this book went beyond the &quot;is she?&quot; question.   More profound for me were basic questions of identity.  <br />How can one possibly prove that one is who one is?  Think about it.  What possible arguments could you make?  How could you convince people that you were who you said you were?  I realized that one could become lost, cast adrift without the anchor of identity in the world.<br />Kurth made a very convincing &quot;she is&quot; argument.  And it was hauntingly sad to think that maybe, just maybe Anna Anderson had memories of being a cosseted little girl in the palaces of St. Petersburg and because she couldn't proved that she was who she was, she ended up living a large part of her life in squalor - her very self denied.<br />Science has erased some of these questions and Peter Kurth's book is now dated due to the science of DNA and the good grace of Prince Phillip.  But prior to DNA...  [prior to DNA results, I would have rated slightly higher - but he was wrong, after all	1997-07-09

To say that the most intriguing aspect of Paul West's novels are the titles might be damning with faint praise.  But the titles are great - &quot;Bela Lugosi's White Christmas&quot;, &quot;Lord Byron's Doctor&quot;,  and, of course, &quot;The Very Rich Hours of Count Von Stauffenberg&quot;.  These all do what a title ought - tease you into interest.  What about Lord Byron's doctor?  And why the doctor and not Lord Byron?  I think of Bing and white, not Bela and white.<br />Knowing that Von Stauffenberg was the man who carried the bomb into the meeting to try to assassinate Adolf Hitler, I was drawn to this book by the title.  So it was not only the title, but also the subject matter.  West chooses interesting subjects.  The bomb plot to kill Hitler, the Jack the Ripper murders, Lord Byron (who, according to Caroline Lamb, was mad, bad and dangerous to know).<br />So, drawn by the subject matter, intrigued by the title (what was it that  made Von Stauffenberg's hours rich?), I picked up the book.  LOVED the cover.<br />I find it hard to describe Paul West's style.  The closest I can come is to say it is a densely written book.  There are a lot of words, and not all the words carry one forward into the tale.  Indeed, in some instances one feels like one has stepped into a small eddy of words and only after whirlling about a bit does one spin out of the eddy and move on to the next.  When not half way through the book I recognized we were coming upon the moment of Von Stauffenberg's demise,  and given that the narrator of the book was Von Stauffenberg himself, I was curious to see how West was going to approach the second half of the book.  I underestimated the man.  The death of the narrator did not phase him for one moment.  Nor did it cause a change in the voice of the book.  Goodness.  I hadn't expect that.<br />I have also read The Women Of Whitechapel - drawn again by subject, title and cover.  But I give.  As curious as I am about Bela and his white Christmas, about Lord Byron and his doctor, I'm gonna give it a pass	1997-07-08

To say that the most intriguing aspect of Paul West's novels are the titles may be damning with faint praise.  But the titles are great.  &quot;Lord Byron's Doctor&quot;, &quot;Bela Lugosi's White Christmas&quot; and, of course, &quot;The Very Rich Hours of Count Von Stauffenberg&quot;.  These are wonderful titles.  They tease one into contemplation - what about Lord Byron's doctor?  And why the doctor?  They create contradictory images.  Bela Lugosi brings to mind darkness, bats, vampires and blood.  To picture Bela Lugosi frolicking through a White Christmas (with Bing crooning in the background) could cause a slight brain cramp.<br />More than the titles, I am drawn by the subjects Mr. West chooses to explore.  Jack the Ripper stalking the women of Whitechapel through the fogs of London.  Lord Byron, who was, according to Caroline Lamb, mad, bad and dangerous to know.  And the rich Von Stauffenberg, rakish in his eye patch, who carried the bomb into a meeting with Adolf Hitler in an abortive assassination attempt.<br />So we have interesting subjects, intriguing titles.  Enough so that I picked up and looked at a copy of The Very Rich Hours of Count Von Stauffenberg.  LOVED the cover.<br />Trying to think of a word to describe Mr. West's style, &quot;dense&quot; came to mind. This is a densely written book - lots and lots of words.  But the words don't always move one forward in the story.  Instead, it feels as if one has fallen into an eddy of words, and only after whirling about in place for a while does one spin out of the eddy and move on to the next.  When only half way through the book I realized we were fast approaching the moment of Von Stauffenberg's demise.  Since the book is written in his voice, I was curious as to how Mr. West would deal with the rest of the book.  I had underestimated the man.  The death of the narrator didn't phase the author in the least.  I hadn't expected that.<br />Drawn by subject, title and cover, I also read The Women of Whitechapel.  And now, as curious as I am about Lord Byron's doctor and Bela Lugosi's Christmas (white or otherwise), I'm gonna have to give it a passtechapel.

Somehow my expectations were not met; I found the book strangely flat when I expected it to sing.  The title and the concept behind it captivated me.  I thought &quot;the color of water&quot; a descriptively wonderful way for Mr. McBride's mother to make her point.  And when Mr. McBride said he would unfold the story of his mother and &quot;betwixt and between&quot; we would find his own story, I was intrigued.<br />Expectations are personal things, and I built my expectations on the above.  And found myself disappointed in the reading.  I felt the author told his story and betwixt and between was his mother's story - the reverse of his promise.  Unfortunately for me, it was his mother's story and not his own which I found compelling.  When speaking with her voice I found a power, vividness and intensity that grabbed my attention.  Those same elements I found lacking in his story	1997-07-08

And how many of them used a conventional chessboard and pieces?  I found the chess game in the picture Julia was restoring the most compelling.  I liked that the author tried to stretch the boundaries of dimension.  But the ending!  Was it believable?  Did I buy that it would be THAT person for THOSE reasons?  And the start of that beautiful friendship as the two walked away into the twilight?  Truly stretching it	1997-07-08

I have two things to say about the Amelia Peabody series.  The first is, for heaven's sake, that they are down right silly.  The second is that I love them.<br />Walking the line between a murder mystery and a parody of a bodice-ripper, there are times I find myself laughing out loud.  Peabody's somewhat prim description of uproarious events along with her own deluded self-image (outmatched by Emerson's view of himself as a quiet and reasonable person) makes for great fun.<br />Even more fun for me is the casual but fairly accurate account of Egyptology of the day - along with many sly references to Flinders Petrie which would escape the casual reader with no background knowledge of the man and his work.<br />Great literature?  Oh, probably not.  But will I look forward to and rush out to by the next installment?  Youbetcha	1997-07-07

Amelia Earhart, for example, fits all three categories.<br />The story of Nicholas and Alexandria is an outstanding example.  It's all there:  Great love and passion.  Royalty, high society and decadence.  Rasputin.  A young heir with a fatal flaw.  War and revolution.  A massacre.  Missing bodies.  Pretenders.<br />A Lifelong Passion opens a window into the private lives of these most famous people.  Through a remarkably well edited series of letters and journal entries, the past echos again today with the unmistakable love and devotion between Nicholas and Alexandria.  And also sadly portrays their inability to truly see and understand the events around them.  A beautiful and lyrical book	1997-07-07

The reviews were outstanding.  After reading the book, I am of the opinion that the reviewers reviewed Katherine Graham's life, not her book.  If ever a good editor was needed, it was during the first third of this book.  I ended up where I began - interesting life.  Can't wait for the biography.  Ms. Graham did not bring herself to life.  I could never picture her in her house or at the dinner table.  I felt she kept us at something more than arm's length.  And while she shared some very personal events, I never felt the emotional impact	1997-07-03

I found it a dark, claustrophic book.  Perhaps that was intentional on the author's part - all those big trees blocking out the sun and all.  I will admit that the American pioneers hold little faciniation for me, which undoubtedly skews my opinion.  I understand that in them there days people probably &quot;reckoned&quot; all kinds of things.  I don't think today's prose describing the past needs to be full of idiomatic accents.  I reckoned that was distracting more than anything else.  So we have a dark dark book full of reckoning AND it is episodic to boot.  Episodic, while occassionally an effective liturary devise, can also strike one as a method to use in stringing together vingettes and never fully realizing the characters' depth.  So, now I am left with a dark, claustrophobic, episodic novel full of pretentious accents.  I know others love this book.  It did not work for me	1997-07-03
