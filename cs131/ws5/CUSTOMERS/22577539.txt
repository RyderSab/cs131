I really liked learning more about them also Nancy goes into great detail about Elvis and his last days. I also enjoyed the stories about the strange things that went on in Graceland after Elvis died. Nancy also mentions Lisa's marriages. and tells us a little about that this is just a very very interesting book on Elvis as well as the Presley family. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!	2005-10-06
