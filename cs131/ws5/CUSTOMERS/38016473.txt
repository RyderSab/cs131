Between some convincing action scenes and crisp fast-paced dialogue lies a novel in need of far more originality.  Indeed, first-time romantic suspense author Cristiane Heggan (Cannes, Gloss...) has half hold of her reins. Dominating hackneyed phrases and paper-thin characters kill her grip on the well-intended intrigue.  What could have been a first rate thrill-fest ends up being nothing more than dj vu, which is a shame, for Heggan obviously has talent to make it big.  She just needs a sharp-er and less obvious plot.  Let's hope her next title delivers just that.-----Martin Boucher	2005-08-22

Pepper Minesse (!) only has revenge on her mind when she sets out to destroy the men who did her wrong in the very compelling POWER PLAY.  Author Penny Jordan paints an accurate portrait of the 80's woman whose money and power alleviate her to superwoman status in her quest to face inner demons.  Her difficult path to fulfillment brings her to undiscovered territories that make for a fun and compulsive read.  Some of her decisions may be hard to swallow (her feelings for Miles, for example) but POWER PLAY stays an entertaining yarn that is narratively enjoyable and worth every penny.-----Martin Boucher	2005-08-19

Storyteller extraordinaire Collins pens out an effective saga of a poor boy venturing into the Mafia business of the 20's, where a bunch of friends and foes suffer in the name of love, honor or revenge. The author does a great job delivering an edge-of-your-seat escapism read that goes back and forth in time.  Furthermore, The now-infamous I-am-woman-hear-me-roar Lucky Santagelo character is even introduced.  Oh yes, CHANCES should definitely be on top of everyone's reading pile.-----Martin Boucher <br />	2005-08-04

A quick read (less than 200 pages), THE BOOGENS has plenty of suspenseful moments and believable characters to make it a fun time-waster.

Protagonists Constance Mackenzie and teenaged daughter Allison lead off a colorful cast of characters whose secrets and lies end up having major consequences.  Grace Metalious's narration goes from the lyrical (any setting description) to the very real (a character's rape, among others).

Yes, we've all seen it before, but Bagshawe's effective plot and colorful characters give THE MOVIE the edge it needs to stay above ground.

Naming her Dawn Avalon and putting her at risk when she is wrongfully accused of murder, Dawn flees India to London where, as Queenie Kelley, she becomes a superstar of the stage and screen, while trying her best to stay incognito.  Effectively narrated, Korda's story takes you back to a time when studio kings were enthralled by their star pets, as Queenie Kelly was by many, but especially by writer/director David Konig. Their union during the making of his movie is as enchanting and as riveting as the entire novel itself.  Glamorous to the core, with colorful characters and edge-of-your-seat intrigue, QUEENIE is a perfect example of great escapist fiction.-----Martin Boucher	2005-07-20

Everything about THE NAMELESS is highly impressive: from its multi-dimensional protagonist to its perfect plot pace, to its many edge-of-your-seat atmospheric moments.  His prose is as gripping as the dark presence looming over the heroine.  The ability with which he uses his narrative is reason enough to pick this one up.  One word, one sentence, says so much.

It aims more at the literary crowd rather then the gore-hounds that take center stage nowadays.  But if any of the latter is curious enough to explore, this is the novel to get.  Peter Straub's multi-faceted narrative mixed with a slow build up make this haunted tale of past mistakes and unforeseen future a one highly impressive read.  There are many strong moments in GHOST STORY where the protagonists and the reader merge to face evil, scenes that vibrate with terror and danger.  Straub incorporates them through imaginative storytelling and mesmeric prose.  Yes, his plot and subplots may linger at times, and, yes, his climax is a somewhat complex delivery, but overall GHOST STORY is one piece of horror fiction that deserves the crossover, if only for the harrowing way Straub uses his pen.-----Martin Boucher	2005-06-28

Jack Ketchum pulls out all the stops in this coming-of-age tale of survival among evil, whose human form is scarier than any monster imaginable. Based on a true story, Ketchum's fifth Leisure offering is explicit to the core and not for the fainted heart.  It is a ride like no others, but a well-deserved one, for TGND is one scary read, told with a sharp and inhibited mind.  An unforgettable journey to the center of madness.

A sort of grade B \\"giallo\\" novel for the slasher crowd. John Russo delivers the goods with a fast-paced rhythm and a sense of crudeness that fits like a serial killer glove. Although none of his characters are memorable, the premature execution of their livelihood, however, is downright effective. Russo may not be prose-witty, but the tight direction with which he controls his narrative packs a good punch.

His unidimensional characters may go through every impossible situation known to man but, boy, are the chapters engrossing. His scenes are as tight as his heroines' perfect attributes.

Like its big brother, SWAN SONG delivers a knockout punch via its multi-layered characters, plot and scares. McCammon strongly weaves a tale of friendship and forgiveness among the havoc of the apocalypse, and that despite its been-there-done-that theme. Indeed, the author easily manages to come out of the rip-off ruins with originality and grandeur. His pen is as effective as any atomic bomb. Sure, the ending tends to verge on the melodramatic, but can you really hold it against him when the ride to there is such a wild and stylish one?

PET SEMATARY was one of them.  It is not the best King (that would be 1978's The Stand) nor his worse (none really since the man could make anything work, including his grocery list). PET is middle of the road King, a not always subtle action-packed chillfest of a man's uncontrolled desire to bring the dead back to life.  Again, the author uses his pen like a magic wane and delivers a nonstop read that deserves all the attention, if only for his always impressing prose.  That, mixed with his ever-so dark mind is such a welcomed wagon from all those get-fixed quick horror hits invading the literary market lately.

Her journey is a gossipy, bold, sometimes touching sometimes funny, inspiring roller coaster ride that will be enjoyed by many.

One has to wonder why. Not that the novel is a goner. Beauman clearly knows how to write. Her prose is as eloquent as her setting and characterization. A lot had been invested in this novel, and kudos for that since the woman definitely has all the makings of a best-selling author. But despite DESTINY's many powerful moments told with warmth and flair (like the outcome of the heroine's childhood friend, for instance), the novel lacks strength.  Predictability wins over substance. Beauman's destined to be together characters H'l'ne and Edouard are a likeable duo, and karma sure does wonders for both of them, yet without much of originality to boost up its sagging plot, Sally Beauman's first major outer since penning a few Harlequins (as Vanessa James) leaves much to be desired.-----Martin Boucher	2005-04-18

You get the idea. There's also a villain (well, two, actually, but one is more of the real deal) who is a serial killer praying on the physically imperfect and who happens (*drum roll*) to be the young handicapped's stepfather (*yawn*). To make a long story short, Koontz has written a dud.  Besides recycling his villain from his decade ago novel Dark Rivers of the Heart, and putting him in a all new adventure, which, by the way, feels more like a repeat since we've seen it all before, the pace of ODAFH is slower than a grass snake frozen by fright. The last 100 pages where the action/conclusion is supposed to accelerate everything are so unbearably slow, one can't help but feel cheated for having stuck through it. Yes, Mr. Koontz is a whiz in creating effective prose, and yes, his characters are still somewhat marginally enjoyable, but as a whole ODAFH suffers from every aspect of overabundance (sort of like this review). And if that isn't enough, the over-the-top preachy and (yes) juvenile tone this one takes is just too much. Seven words: better leave this book at the door.-----Martin Boucher	2005-04-18

Armed now with more flair and heart than any author in the Oprah's Book Club, Koontz has winningly concocted a tale of redeemed souls in the face of hardship.  The hardship this time being in the character of Junior Cain, a sociopathic, narcissistic paranoidal who will stop at nothing to destroy what he considers to be his greatest threat: his illegitimate child.  The path he takes to find him is one roller coaster ride of loose trails and dangerous encounters.  But what really sets FTCOHE apart from any of the author's previous work is in its sensitivity.  Koontz's prose doesn't just touch, it moves.  The exchange between car accident victims Agnes and her ill-fated husband is a fine example of a writer at the peak of his form.  He achieves a plateau of lyricism and finesse without verging on the melodramatics.  What does tend to be a tad too much, though, are the many polished words one crosses during the reading of the novel.  Less would have been just as fine.  Yet, the new Koontz impresses, the new Koontz disturbs, the new Koontz is definitely a welcoming breath of fresh air.-----Martin Boucher	2005-03-07

Told with real pizzazz, LOVELY ME meticulously brings you back to a time when evolution was everywhere, even in so-called fluffy novels like the ones of Jacqueline Susann. Her personal struggles behind all of her fiction glamour definitely make for a compelling read.-----Martin Boucher	2005-02-01

Jackie Collins is in top form, delivering the ultimate  Hollywood novel in which all suffer in the name of love (and happiness, of course).  From the innocent but sexy ingenue to the unhappy used-up rich wife, HOLLYWOOD WIVES (1983) doesn't miss a beat in bringing you dishy accounts of the rich and famous.  You'll have as much fun trying to put real names (that is if you're over 30) to the many characters as figuring out who's the narrative culprit behind the facade.  Told with a sharp mind and a fast-paced style, Collins' tale is filled with romance, intrigue and suspense; a fabulously compelling fun read that never pretends to be anything more than what it is.-----Martin Boucher	2005-01-26

True to the form, the path to hooking up is one bumpy ride, but Joyce's account toward this destination is a juicy, glossy, sexually-charged roman  clef that lifts from its first page and stays above water. The author evidently has fun with her subjects. (SPOILER AHEAD) Their hot and cold attitude towards one another satisfyingly builds up to a grand sparks-fly union destined to become happily ever after. Joyce's world of caviar and champagne may not always be original but the passion and dedication with which she writes make for a fun and exciting experience.-----Martin Boucher	2005-01-21

Lee's pen is wicked; there's no doubt about that. His horror scenes are always nasty, which is a good thing when one seeks out that sort of thing. Just try to pick up his Creekers without cringing. Hardcore stuff. Yet, behind all the gross-outs and the violence is always a Lee with a purpose, a Lee with a story to tell. Which is exactly what lacks in CITY INFERNAL. What we get instead is just an amateurish take of hell where nothing really happens except when the heroine discovers yet another God-given gift that will help her on to next level in her search of her already dead missing sister. A sort of a Nintendo game with no winning gold or, in this case, no plot rewards. Yes, Lee's prose is still clear and fast and his action scenes are somewhat effective, but his vision of horror will need some retooling if his next delivery resembles anything like this lackluster one.-----Martin Boucher	2005-01-12

US	38016473	R3HUKSARB72NQT	067146714X	675708979	Lace	Books	3	3	5	N	N	MORE LIKE COTTON	Here's an example of a novel less impressive than its adaptation to the small screen. We still get Lili, the sexy superstar in search of her mother. We get the three school chums who stay united through thick and thin (or through \\"sick and sin\\" according to French Maxine), the men in their lives, the Valentine dance ball, and the birth of an illegitimate child. But what's added to this already rich cast of characters is a brochette of less than colorful ones, like Guy, the struggling designer who's storyline about stolen creations doesn't really go anywhere, and the introduction of a fourth friend named Kate who's presence only ends up being lukewarm. How many times can the reader endures her failed relationships with men without being ill at ease. Just a much too long distraction that lacks punch. Yet author Conran knows how to create effective moments. Lili's trapped-in-a-spiderweb-like lifestyle is a page-turning experience that adds depth to her thinly veiled character, and Abdullah's political marginality is a riveting take from the already established views of the Frenches and the Americans. But moments like those aren't a dime a dozen in this novel. What could have been a fun, unique experience of getting into the psyche of all the main characters already introduced on TV turned out to be an overlong, under-edited unimpressiveness that shouldn't have been. A shame.-----Martin Boucher	2005-01-10

Five other UK published books preceded this one. It's clear to say she followed Jackie Collins' roman  clef style to pen (yet again) a wonderful wicked page-turner herslef. PALM BEACH chronicles the ups and downs of two misfits yearning to find one another despite the odds. Typical stuff you might say, but what sets the novel apart from the many paint-by-the-numbers releases out there is in its unique approach of style.  Booth uses a lyrical undertone while building a richer and craftier plot. Indeed, she works hard to create a variation on the same theme.  Make no mistake, PALM BEACH is a beach read: you get all the stereotypical fluff expected, but with an added edge to it that makes the reading experience all the more worthwhile. No wonder it became an international bestseller.-----Martin Boucher	2005-01-10

It is filled with in-your-face violence and gore, but concocted by a pro hand.  A bunch of young people gather in a cabin to relax and have fun, unaware that they are fast becoming lunch to in-living cavern hillbillies. Dallas Mayr (real name for Jack Ketchum) is without a doubt a master in creating shocking scenes (and there are plenty of them) but he's also a heck of a prose maker, with his clear details and breathing characters.  Every word he uses is finely tuned as it slowly but surely brings you to the pulse-pounding skillfully choreographed horror-fest where our heros and heroines fight back to stay alive.

Year after year he manages to satisfy his readers by creating original unputdownable page-turners like PIN, IMP, BABY SQUAD.  When not so original, his novels are still a treat, if not for their fast-paced reads, for the skillful way Neiderman creates his own take on the subject, such as in NIGHT HOWL, the tale of a laboratory man-made German shepherd on the loose and the people chasing it.  A reminiscence of Steve King's CUJO (where a viscous dog is attacking a woman and her son) and of Dean Koontz's WATCHERS (centered around a dog and its pursuers), NIGHT HOWL mostly delivers when Neiderman gets rid of his first third clich-ridden plot.  Then it becomes a roller-coaster thrill ride where the hunters become the hunted, the enemies are not what they appear to be and the creature's itinerary to freedom is taking him (and us) to undiscovered places.  The author's philosophical vision of the dog's journey even adds sparks to it all.  Just like a good grade-B novel, NIGHT HOWL succeeds what it's set out to do : entertain its readers.  It is a well constructed if sometimes stereotypical piece of suspenseful fluff.-----Martin Boucher	2003-11-20

Returning to his Missouri hometown after inheriting his aunt's estate, Jay Clute and his young daughter soon realize that all is not what it appears to be.  People are acting stranger by the minute, time inexplicably comes to a standstill, and to make matters worse, talkative toys have taken over Jay's properties.  How will the Clutes deal with all of this ?    Survival is the theme, here, for this oh-so cheesy horror opus in which the plot, just like its thinly developed inhabitants, goes in all directions.  Sometimes a horror story, sometimes a adventure yarn, TOYS CEMETERY can't seem to find its true voice, but one thing is for sure: the novel is never boring.  Page-filled action and gore aplenty, plus a hero with a trick or two up his sleeve make CEMETERY enjoyable despite the author's repetitive storyline (check out any of his horror novels) and his obvious degradation of women characters (again, check out his novels).  Every female is a victim of Johnstone's overripe sexual imagination.  It's no wonder he ended up leaving the horror field to concentrate on adventures and westerns, where men rule.  His children characters, however, do bear a certain credibility, especially in their interaction with one another.  One can't help but ponder on how much more effective the book would have been with them as center stage.    As a grade-B novel, TOY CEMETERY delivers in spite of its headless-chicken-run plot and it's one-dimensional characters, but as a piece of horror literature, it completely fails to pass the test.-----Martin Boucher	2003-08-06

Thirteen-year-old Mark Blackwood is so dissatisfied with his family life that he runs away, encountering many people, one of which being a recruiter for the Redemption House, a shelter for lost souls. Overjoyed, Mark thinks he finally found a place where he'll belong but quickly discovers how wrong... and right... he is.    Taking the _Hensel & Gretel_ children story one step further and adding elements of _Lord of the Flies_, Stephen Gresham creates a unique and effective boys-in-jeopardy tale with a ghostly undertone.  His main character Mark is a strong, resourceful young man who soon becomes the leader of a bunch of colorful secondary characters. Among them is the solver of all problems Digger, physically challenged but very strong Ocie, bad-tempered and elusive Zack, and paternal Dealy who is the glue to this reconstructed family.  It is through him that the boys will interact, expressing their most secret thoughts. This is where Gresham shines the most, in his ability to cut through the obvious and to go deeper into the psyche of his people.  It is clearly evident that he knows a thing or two about teenage angst.    The adults, here, are mostly evil, with the exception of two \\"outsiders\\" who, like the teens themselves, are trapped in their own web of unhappiness.  The sudden awareness of their inner strength helps move the plot to a highly satisfying conclusion.  Suspenseful, scary, yet surprisingly touching, RUNAWAY will surely gather new fans while captivate current ones.  Definitely a must.-----Martin Boucher	2003-08-02

Each of her many penning novels is a frightening experience one will sink his/her teeth into.  SEE NO EVIL, for instance, starts out with a bang and keeps the reader glued to the pages.  Wallace's prose is simple, on-the-target, with numerous chapters so the reader can stop at any time, but won't, for SEE NO EVIL is addictive and will probably be read in one sitting. The story centers around two blind children who regain their sight (after having had a corneal transplantation) with devastating results, especially to those around them. The author succeeds not only in creating an intriguing plot but also in weaving it ever-so effectively one can only be impressed by this skillful touch. Sure, her characterization is paper-thin, and her story has some noticeable loopholes, but if one is prepared to overlook these flaws, SEE NO EVIL will be pure joy to whomever picks it up.-----Martin Boucher	2003-07-15
