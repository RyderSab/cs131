Not only is it entertaining for young readers, but it also provides an age appropriate discussion of learning disabilities.<br /><br />Anna is struggling with her school work, and her parents have decided that her pony is too much of a distraction.  Since she can't seem to improve her grades, they decide to return her pony to the stable.  By chance, Anna makes a new friend who teaches her about dyslexia, and suggests that Anna might have a similar learning disability.  With the help of her friends, Anna is able to convince her parents that she has been doing her best, and that she needs extra help.<br /><br />This story has a happy ending, and it should help young readers understand a bit about learning disabilities.  A wonderful combination.	2005-10-03

Detective Andy Rusch is a detective in New York, a city of 35 million people, working for a police department understaffed and overworked.  When he begins investigating the murder of a man with important political connections, he finds himself doing twice as much work to finish an investigation that is soon forgotten by everyone else.  Set against the backdrop of an overcrowded city (and world) with ever dwindling resources, this book is at its best in its descriptions of the desperation of the starving, essentially homeless citizens.  We are drawn into the squallor and get a glimpse of the lengths people will go to survive.  These compelling glimpses tie an otherwise pedestrian story together and make it an interesting read.  The biggest weakness here is the sermonizing about the merits of birth control.  While these concerns may have been valid at the time the book was written, the author's worst fears have not materialized, and birth control is now widely accepted and practiced, so that this book reads a bit like someone preaching to the choir.  Over all, a diverting book, but certainly not the greatest distopia ever composed.	2005-09-29

Fulghum's role here is more as an editor, presenting other people's stories.  But what stories!  These stories demonstrate the vast diversity of love, and show us that love can take as many forms as there are different people.  Some of these stories are sad, others poignant, and many are incredibly romantic.  Scattered in between these stories are comments by Fulghum, under the heading \\"Perspective,\\" where he discusses his impressions of the stories or relates stories of his own.  This book is easily as reflective as any of his earlier work, but has fewer \\"laugh out loud\\" moments.  It provides some interesting perspectives on relationships, and certainly is a must read for anyone who consideres themself to be a romantic.	2005-09-22
US	52932955	R33HQGI9KRSTQI	0671785850	272373633	The Word	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Too little action, too late	While the underlying premise of this book, namely the discovery of a previously unknown Gospel and a Roman parchment confirming the existance of Jesus of Nazareth, holds a lot of potential for a thrilling story, author Irving Wallace largely fails to deliver here.  For the first half of the book, we follow public relations specialist Steve Randall as he travels from place to place meeting various members of the publication team producing a new Bible incorporating these new finds.  Unfortunatly, the main reason for these meetings seems to be to allow Wallace to provide his lengthy and detailed exposition in the guise of dialog.  The first half of the book is tedious and unexciting, and only when Randall begins to find discrepencies in the new documents does the story begin to improve.  Unfortunately, there is too little action for too much of the book, and while the second half is better than the beginning, it takes far too long to get to.<br /><br />This story also reflects the culture of the early 1970's, when it was written.  People smoke in hospitals (!), there is no security in the airports, and the furniture and clothing descriptions clearly reflect the period.  The story is also set against the cultural questioning of organized religion that also marked the period, and Wallace seems to be arguing that Christianity needed a breath of fresh air to save it from irrelevance.  The underlying themes regarding the nature of faith and its role in life are still worth considering.  Perhaps the most important question raised by this book is \\"What is the meaning of faith?\\"	2005-09-20

The first section of the book includes some graphic content that struck me as extremely gratuitous.  It was disturbing enough that I almost put the book down and moved on to something else.  Something made me hold on, and by the middle of the second section, I was hooked.<br /><br />This book is really several love stories, and one of the strengths of this book is the flawed nature of the various characters and the effects these flaws have on their relationships.  In particular the relationship of Seamus and Matilda O'Day stands out as the realistic struggle required to make a marriage work, inspite of significant obstacles.  While the relationships are central to this story, the culture of the fire service is also a critical component.  The other strength of this book is the integrity of its depiction of the fire department and the firefighters who make a career out of saving lives.  The firehouse life is authentically portrayed, and the descriptions of the fires transports you to the heat, smoke and chaos of the fireground.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these powerful elements are weakened in places by pedestrian prose, and by the gatuitously graphic content, especially at the beginning.  These scenes don't really seem to serve the story, so that they feel like they were added purely for shock value.  The story would be just as effective with less graphic descriptions, and the overall impact might be improved.  What could have been a powerful story about the emotional toll of a firefighter's life is cheapened by this material.	2005-08-31

Set against the backdrop of the first World War, we get a glimpse of childhood almost a hundred years ago, when the automobile was still a new fangled contraption, and the wilderness was much closer.  While many aspects of this story would be highly unlikely in today's world, they seem perfectly natural here, and we follow along as Sterling fends for himself and learns some valuable lessons about life.  Filled with charming humor and a cast of memorable characters, both human and animal, this is a story that you will fondly remember for a long time.	2005-08-26

Instead, Brinkley has composed a collection of essays recounting, as mentioned in the subtitle, the people, places and events that have captured his interest during his career as a television journalist.  These compositions provide glimpses into the past sixty years, and are both observant and humorous.  Brinkley helps shed some light on the second half of the twentieth century, and in doing so, also provides us a glimpse into his own personality.  Through his insights and reactions, we can just begin to get a glimmer of the man behind the familiar face.	2005-08-25

Tolkien's attention to detail shines here, both in his descriptions of the battle scenes, and in the attention to the struggles of Sam and Frodo.  In the end, you almost feel as if you've lived through the war yourself.<br /><br />Tolkien has a message here.  While he clearly considers war to be an evil, it is equally clear that he feels that it is sometimes necessary for good people to sacrifice everything to fight the forces of evil.  Tolkien wrote these books in the aftermath of two World Wars, and that influence is almost palplable in this book.  Above all, this is a story of courage and sacrifice, about standing up and fighting for what is good against those that would destroy it.	2005-08-19

It also explores the impact our choices have on our lives, as well as on our families and communities.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the dialog that forms the framework of this book feels forced, without a natural flow, which detracts from the overall impact.  However, the first person accounts connected by this dialog are quite good, and often very moving.  Overall, a good book for anyone interested in what life in nineteenth century America was like.	2005-08-19

This book details the efforts of both Bryson and his out of shape, recovering alcoholic companion, Stephen Katz, as they struggle to come to terms with the scope of their challenge.  Along the way, we learn about the history of the Trail, as well as bits of history and trivia about the places the trail touches.  This is both an entertaining and informative glimpse of Appalachia and America, with a generous dose of humor along the way.  I never particularly felt called to hike the Appalachian Trail, and now I'm certain that its not something I want to do.

While the first couple of chapters almost put me off the book, with their discussion of the nature of biography, I'm glad I stuck with it to the second half of the book.  Zinsser does a great job of explaining the difficulties in tracing the history of any infectious disease, and manages to make what could have been a highly technical discussion both readable and entertaining.  Written in the 1930's, some of the information in this book is definitely dated.  Specifically, modern antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals have radically changed the role of infectious diseases in our society.  In addition, our understanding of viruses, genetics (including the discovery of DNA), and evolution have all advanced dramatically since the book was written.  Even so, the historical analysis in this book is still enlightening and serves to highlight the often overlooked role of epidemics in history.	2005-07-18

Written in a memoir form, this is a first person acount of what it was like to come of age during World War II.  While the narrator becomes a soldier, this isn't a book about the physical trials of war, but instead is a reflection on the psychic impact of going to war.  We watch how the war impacts almost every aspect of his life, changing him irrevocably from an innocent boy to a cynical man who has seen too much pointless death and destruction.  An emotionally charged view of the costs of war on the survivors, it should be required reading for anyone in a position to put these young soldiers in harms way.	2005-07-18

This books confirms that impression and elaborates on it greatly.  Bryson's writing is extremely vivid and many his anecdotes are very funny.  I suspect that few travellers see as much of Australia as Bryson has, and here is a wonderfully quirky overview of a equally quirky land.  Bryson touches on almost every aspect of life \\"down under,\\" from politics, to geology and zoology, to culture, and well beyond.  This book is entertaining and informative, and may be the next best thing to traveling to Australia yourself.<br /><br />My favorite quote from the book (page 5):  This is a country that loses a prime minister and that is so vast and empty that a band of amateur enthusiasts could conceivably set off the world's first non-governmental atomic bomb on its mainland and almost four years would pass before anyone noticed.  Clearly this is a place worth getting to know.	2005-07-06

In this compelling book, John Kelly relies heavily on contemporary sources that chronicled the plague as it occurred to provide an intimate, if highly disturbing, account of life (and death) in this period.  Kelly provides a detail description of the path of the plague as it travels from Asia and through Europe.  Mixed into this chronicle are eye witness descriptions of the conditions as the plague runs its course, which vividly transport the reader to the period.<br /><br />However, the book looses its momentum near the end.  There is a lengthy chapter on the history of European anti-Semitism that, while interesting, seems out of place in a book on the plague.  Also, the discussion of the recurrent outbreaks of the plague and other epidemics in the following century isn't very compelling, though the discussion of the impact of the high mortality on the social and economic structures of Europe does merit attention.<br /><br />Overall, this was an interesting book, and provided a wealth of detail about what life in the Middle Ages was like.	2005-06-27

This is the nightmare scenario that the National Security Agency (NSA) faces in this lightning-fast thriller.  The NSA is tasked with breaking the codes of the nation's enemies to protect the nation's security.  When a new, supposedly unbreakable code emerges, the NSA races to recover the security codes to keep the code a secret.  From the streets of Seville to the NSA headquarters, the tension builds as time runs out, until a climax that almost destroys the nation's security forever.<br /><br />Dan Brown writes with authority, and much of what he describes is quite believable.  Unfortunately, the climatic ending turns out to be the weakest part of the story.  In order to build the tension, Brown's characters, which to this point have been portrayed as quite intelligent, suddenly develop an epidemic of stupidity.  Their inability to solve the final riddle quickly actually detracts from the impact of the conclusion.  Otherwise, this is a thrilling story, the book equivalent to the summer blockbuster movie:  Full throttle entertainment, but very little depth.	2005-06-18

One is the story of David Reimer and the tragic events of his life.  The other is a cautionary tale about how easy it can be for a researcher to misinterpret or misconstrue the evidence to support their preconceived views.<br /><br />David Reimer's story is thoroughly compelling.  His struggles with his identity are truly tragic, and extract a heavy toll on his entire family.  That this family didn't completely disintegrate is a testament to the strength of every member of this family.  Unfortunately, while this book ends on a hopeful note, the story doesn't end happily.  About two years after publication, David's brother dies of an apparent overdose.  David apparently never recovered from the shock of his brother's death, and in 2004, following the failure of his marriage and loss of his job, he committed suicide at age 38.  Truly a tragic ending to a tragic life.<br /><br />At first impression, the other thread of this book comes off as an indictment of quackery in medicine.  However, I think that the deeper lesson is a reminder that all researchers carry with them preconceived ideas about what the results should look like.  What sets the best scientists apart is their ability to set aside their preconceptions when the data doesn't support them.  In this case, overly sweeping conclusions were drawn from scanty evidence.  These conclusions were never critically questioned.  Unfortunately, it is all to easy (and entirely human) to allow our prejudices to dictate our interpretation of sparse data, and it often leads to tragic results.  That is the cautionary message in this book.	2005-05-20

However, the primary point here seems to be that creating a new terminology will enable a more productive discussion of the abuses of rank that rob people of their dignity.  Whether such a discussion would inevitably lead to the societal changes suggest here is unclear, but the goals are certainly admirable.<br /><br />However noble the author's intentions, this book is a bit of a chore to read.

The tone set in the opening chapters led me to believe that this would be a fair discussion of the relationship between American Society and the Roman Catholic Church.  The copious source notes indicate show the extent of the author's research into the subject matter, and an unbiased presentation of the facts would have been quite useful as a basis for discussion and debate.  Unfortunately, the author describes his finding in an extremely cynical fashion, and makes his opinions of the goals of the Church hierarchy quite plain, which detracts from the books impact.  Had the author simply presented the facts, and allowed the reader to reach his or her own conclusions, this book would have been an important tool in assessing the role of the Church in America.<br /><br />Published in 1949, there is much about this book that is out of date.  The reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960's has greatly changed the Catholic Church, though the author's points regarding medicine and sex remain largely valid.  American society has changed as well, with the cultural upheaval of the 1960's and tremendous changes in technology.  Finally, the world has changed...facism and communism have both largely disappeared, and the Church's influence in Europe had waned considerably.<br /><br />This book represents an attack by the author on Church policies from a half-century ago, and in that sense it has lost its relevance.  To the extent that religious conservatives are still trying to co-opt public policy, there are still point in here to ponder.	2005-03-18

Born a princess and married to German nobility, she never exploited the power of her station. Instead, she used her position and wealth to feed and care for the poor. She also refused to eat any food unless she was sure that it hadn't been exploited from the peasants, challenging the very foundations of the feudal system of the era. After being widowed, she voluntarily chose a life of poverty and continued to work with the poorest and sickest people she could find.<br /><br />While Elizabeth's story is remarkable, this book barely does it justice. In the hands of a more talented author, this story could be quite inspirational. However, the author's description of the politics of the early thirteenth century is pedestrian and is very tiresome to read. While these details help illustrate the unusual nature of Elizabeth's life, but the treatment needs a great deal of help. The scholarship behind this old book (published in 1954) is also apparent in the author's acceptance of legends that have become revised or discounted by intervening research. Overall, this is the story of an inspirational woman, portrayed in an uninspiring book.	2005-03-08

In the first two Janissaries books we were introduced to Rick Galloway and his band of mercenary soldiers as they are kidnapped by aliens and transported to Tran, a world trapped in the middle ages, to grow illicit drugs for the aliens.  We followed Galloway's adventures as he befriended the locals and tried to introduce technology to improve their lives and defend themselves against their enemies.<br /><br />This final volume to the Janissaries series was a disappointment on a number of levels.  Most significantly, while it does further develop the activities of the human servants of the alien civilization off of Tran, that part of the story is never brought to a conclusion.  Also not resolved it the question of the preparations of the humans on Tran for the coming \\"Time.\\"  We are not provided with any closure on the question of whether the mercenaries will be able to prepare their new friends and allies to survive the coming conflict with the aliens.<br /><br />The first two-thirds of this book delve deeply into the political intrique, and it is only in the last third that we return to the faster paced military story.  Unfortunately, the book ends with the battle, without resolving any of the important plot lines.  In many ways, it feels like another book was meant to follow this, but no such follow up seems to exist.  It isn't clear why so much time was spent developing these plot lines if the ending was intended to leave them unresolved.  The ending of the first book was much more satisfying, and that book can clearly stand on its own, but by the end of the third book, the reader deserves a more complete ending.	2005-02-25

In order to achieve this goal, however, Galloway and his men must bring order to the chaotic mix of human cultures they find surrounding them.  By carefully building alliances, Galloway begins to transform the planet's social, political and military landscape.  However, his efforts are hampered by the changing climate and the resulting mass migrations.  Galloway struggles to improve the lives of the people he rules, always mindful that any progress he promotes increases the chances that the aliens will bomb the planet back to the stone age.<br /><br />While not as well written as the first book, this follow up does flesh out the varied cultures on the planet Tran, and shows the continuing impact of the introduction of advanced technical knowledge in a low technology culture.  The military and political implications prove to be challenging, but perhaps not as bad as the social impact.  While the first book could have stood on its own, this one ends abruptly, without any resolution, and is clearly intended to be read as part of a series.	2005-02-15

Upon opening the book and discovering the illustrations, I was prepared for a cheesy space opera, especially since the story starts with space aliens abducting a group of mercenaries from the jungles of Africa.  However, from this rather pedestrian opening, the author has developed an intriguing story.<br /><br />Set against a backdrop of an old and large galactic civilization that uses humans as administrators and servants, this is a story of survival.  One race of aliens is illegally kidnapping humans and transporting them to a secret planet to cultivate periodic crops of an intoxicating drug.  The mercenaries are dropped, with their equipment, into the middle of a human culture trapped in the middle ages.  Can they gain the control and cooperation of the exisiting human society and produce the drugs required by the aliens?  Should they even try?  Can they use their twentieth century knowledge to help the humans prepare for the impending climatic shifts?<br /><br />This book includes interesting analyses of military tactics from various periods of human history, together with a unique setting and a plausible science-fiction story.  It also provides interesting food for thought, especially regarding the proper uses of military power and the use of advanced knowledge to improve the human condition.	2005-02-08

Dave Barry takes aim at the trials and tribulations of home ownership, and hits the mark as accurately as he does any of his targets. This is funny stuff, best appreciated by those of us who have actually been there and done that. I had to read a number of passages to my wife, but her favorite was the bit about finding a pediatric group after moving. There is one piece of advice in here that I might actually follow when we finally are ready to move again: \\"Set fire to your household goods...and just walk away.\\"	2005-02-04

We get an overview of the third crusade and the politics of war and marriage in the middle ages.  The muddled relationships between the various royalty and nobility illustrates the still evolving nature of the European political map.  And of course, the Church has a role in all of these relationships.<br /><br />The weakest aspects of this story are the love story elements.  The level of sexual ambiguity, combined with a tendency to discuss these issues obliquely makes these relationships difficult to understand or appreciate.  It is never clear why King Richard has such strong feelings for Alex, and the development of the relationship between Alix/Alex and Enoch isn't well described.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a terrible book, but it never quite rose to its full potential.	2005-02-02

Mary is a rare 'girl clown' and we follow along as she embarks on a new career in the circus. She learns about the hardships of a nomadic life and hard work, but also finds great satisfaction in performing under the big top.

While these personal accounts are quite powerful and serve to put a human face on a tragedy of almost inconceivable scope, they are only slivers of the big picture.  This book provides a broad overview of the history of Auschwitz, compiled from eyewitness accounts, transcripts of war crimes trials, and the memoirs of Rudolf Hoess and other Nazi's involved in the camp.  While it lacks the emotional impact of a more personal account, this book helps shed some light on the scope of the horrors of Auschwitz and Birkeneau and the holocaust in general.  By itself, it is an important overview, but if read together with the stories of individual survivors, it provides context for understanding the personal accounts.	2005-01-10

This book sheds some light on the history and reputation of the establishment.  However, in spite of the title, this book isn't just about Harry's Bar.  It also has characteristics of a memoir, describing the author's experiences both in Venice and in New York, where two related establishments have existed at various times.  There are also traces of a gossip column in here as well, as the author describes some of the rich and famous who have patronized Harry's Bar over the years.<br /><br />This is a pleasant read, if a little shallow in content.  Perhaps the most interesting element of this book (at least for me, anyway) is the author's views on what constitutes quality service.  It is interesting to read an insider's rant against the popular trends in the hospitality industry.  I also enjoy the descriptions of Venice, as they provided me with a wonderful chance to reflect on the beauty of that city.	2005-01-06

After all, there is nothing overtly religious about Dr. Seuss's stories.  However, they do have strong themes, often defining a basic morality.  So it shouldn't be surprising, I guess, that they can be quite easily linked to religious messages.  Each chapter in this book takes a Dr. Seuss story and relates its message to a relavant Christian theme.  Some of these are obvious, while others require a little more interpretation.  I suspect that this material is much more effective when presented as a sermon by a gifted preacher.<br /><br />This is a short book, and a quick read, and is likely to be of interest to many fans of Dr. Seuss's writing, if only to show another way of looking at the beloved stories he created.	2005-01-03

Instead, this is a tragic story of unrequited love...we might each be the love of someone's life, but what are the chances that the love of our life is that same person?  Not only is Max fated to love a woman who can never fully return his love, but each of the major characters is in love with someone who can reciprocate their feelings.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully written story, with a wealth of period and setting details that bring the story to life.  The unique nature of Max's life is absolutely believable, and provides a terrific vehicle to explore these ideas of love and relationships and how they change with time.  Written as a memoir to his son, this book only provides Max's point-of-view of this story, but we get to know Max intimately, flaws and all, and we develop a deep understanding of what motivates him.  This book drew me in and captivated me right from the beginning, but I can't help wondering what Alice's version of this story would be like.  Perhaps that's part of the tragedy of this story is that we can't truly know or understand the story of others unless they are willing to share it fully with us.	2004-12-15

The church announces the discovery of documents containing the secret prophecy of the Lady of Lourdes to St. Bernadette...that the Virgin will reappear during a specific 8 day period.  Wallace takes us to Lourdes for these eight days and introduces us to a cast of characters drawn here for a variety of reasons.  Set against a detailed description one of the world's most popular pilgrimage sites, this is an exploration of the meaning and role of faith and science in people's lives.  Do miracles really occur?  Or are there rational, scientific explanations?  Does religion have any merit, or is it just so much superstitious nonsense?  These are some of the questions raised by the stories of these various individuals.  Each finds their own answers, but the reader is left to find their own answers in their own lives.  Filled with unique and interesting characters and a vibrant setting, this book is well paced and entertaining.  The author also does a good job of avoiding the predictable, and the ending includes a few surprises.	2004-12-07

This is the first book in the series, and introduces us to Mandy, her parents, grandparents, and her best friend James.  After a stray cat has kittens in the kitchen of her school's custodian, Mandy decides to try to find homes for the kittens to keep the custodian from \\"getting rid\\" of them.  Because this is the first book, the characters aren't as well developed yet, and the story is more predictable than the others we've read.  It also had a much stronger animal rights theme than I've seen previously.  However, I doubt that my daughter noticed much of that, and she certainly enjoyed listening to me read her this book.  Overall, this is a good book for a child that loves animals, especially kittens.	2004-11-29

Books of this type often end up sounding like sermons, but this one remains more conversational.  At the risk of oversimplifying, the most important lessons seem to be about being true to yourself, and about trying to always look for the good in the world.  The author illustrates her points with examples from her own life, but notes that everyone is unique, so we each have to discover our own specifics.  There certainly was a great deal of food for thought here, and even though I'm definitely not the target demographic for this book, I still found much of it worth thinking about.	2004-11-28

Written as a very accessible narrative, this book explores the failure of the political process to produce any compromises that might have prevented to war.  Catton shows how the radical elements on both sides controlled the debate in a dangerous game of brinkmanship that took on a life of its own, eventually making the war inevitable.  The few voices of moderation were silent until it was too late for them to effectively impact events.  This is a reminder of the dangers of extremism and the importance of compromise and dialogue.  It also helps to shed illumination on the underlying causes of the Civil War and the choices important people made as the conflict approached.  This is definitely a \\"must read\\" for anyone interested in trying to understand the American Civil War and its impact on the country.	2004-11-26

She's really not quite ready to read books at this level, but I read it to her before bed over several nights.  This was my first encounter with Animal Ark, and though this book occurs pretty late in the series, it stands well enough on its own.  As an adult, I found the plot was a little predictable and the characters a little flat, but my daughter was absolutely captivated by the story.  The book includes enough educational content that I even learned a thing or two, and I'm sure my daughter learned quite a bit about polar bears and their interactions with human settlements in Canada.  This is a pleasant book to read to a youngster and would probably captivate any young reader whose ready to tackle a fairly easy chapter book.	2004-11-24

This was the second book we read from the Animal Ark series, and like the other we read, it stands pretty well on its own.  My daughter enjoyed this story, and I appreciate that the main characters, Mandy and James, are considerate and responsible children.  I find such positive characters refreshing.  While the main story is about a younger girl, Polly, and her fear of horses, this book also includes a second storyline about a community pagent, and provides a detailed setting for the primary story.  This was another fun book to read to my daughter, and should entertain young readers ready for easy chapter books, especially if they are interested in horses.	2004-11-24

Francis's message of peace resounds through the centuries and could be applicable today on so many levels.  Perhaps the greatest strength of this book is its analysis of the historical record with an eye towards unmasking the true person that was Francis of Assisi.  This examination helps to explain the legends of Francis preaching to the animals and of the stigmata in a way that is plausible while remaining true to the spiritual truth of the man.  It serves as a reminder that historical documents often include symbolic or figurative language and care must be taken to interpret them in context and not to rely on overly literal readings.  Even with the legends explained, Francis remains a fascinating and powerful figure, someone deserving of tremendous respect and worthy of emulation.	2004-11-08

Now others seem to be looking to mine this material as well.  Dourado is David Wood's first book, and overall it is a pretty good effort.  The main characters are just quirky enough to be interesting, and the premise is intriguing.  There is sufficient action to keep the story moving, and the ending isn't telegraphed too early in the story.  While this doesn't have the depth of detail or the extremely intense pacing that is found in The DaVinci Code, this book was very easy to read, and provided an interesting new twist on the source of our biblical stories.

Instead of an international crisis or espionage mission, Op-Center finds itself the target of a budget axe, and must downsize.  At the same time, Op-Center finds itself drawn into a murder investigation that entangles it in the vicious world of Washington politics.<br /><br />This book is trying hard to question the motivations and agendas of the powers-that-be in Washington, but fails to hit its target.  In the end this book feels more like a worn-out detective story that happens to involve Op-Center characters.  Hopefully, future volumes in this series will return to the international stage, where the stories are more interesting, and the potential consequences create more tension.	2004-10-24

Told in the first person, this story has a strong autobiographical feeling to it, and probably closely tracks the author's experiences during the war.  In many ways, this account is unlike anything else I've ever read about this war.  Instead of constant patrols in the jungle with constant ambushes and firefights, this book shows how the war included periods of calm, when a soldier could almost convince himself that there really wasn't a war at all.<br /><br />This story is not an action packed thriller, but a coming of age story, and is filled with a range of characters, all of them convincing, and all of them reflective of the diversity of the men who fought the war.  The narrative draws you in and convincingly describes the setting.  It definitly provided me with a clearer picture of what duty in Vietnam might have been like.	2004-10-18

While the cover art and the title might suggest that this book is about firefighting, only the first two stories are about forest fires.  Junger writes clearly, and his stories are informative and easy to read.  Each of these stories provides a wealth of relevant background and history that adds a great deal of depth to the issue.  With the exception of the forest fire stories and one other, the remaining stories describe the conditions and background of a number of remote conflicts from around the war.  These stories try to explain some of the causes and effects of these brutal wars, and generally succeed in shedding some small light on these situations.<br /><br />However, while the individual stories are each well written and and stand well on their own, the book itself isn't as well put-together.  I kept looking for the common thread or theme that tied all these stories together, and in the end, I don't feel that these stories add up to any kind of coherent whole.  The only commonality seems to be that they were written by Junger and that they reflect his travels and experiences as a journalist.  Perhaps some additional introductory or bridging material elaborating on the impact these experiences had on the author would tie this material together better.  Or perhaps not.  In any case, while the individual stories each had something meaningful to offer, the book, as a whole, really doesn't offer anything above and beyond them.	2004-10-14

I seldom have trouble finishing books, even when I don't like them, but this one was tough.  Clearly the author is trying to convey his vision of enlightenment, but his vision is so bizarre and the writting so stilted that I find it simply impossible to  grasp the author's message or sympathize with his characters.  The drug induced \\"vision\\" sequences are especially difficult to read, and they drag the entire narrative to a crawl.

To keep the Soviets from keeping the secret for themselves, Professor MacDonald flees to Venice.  The local authorities, members of Italy's Communist Party, co-operate with the Soviets and close off access to or from Venice and begin a massive search for the professor.<br /><br />The books basic premise (i.e., the formula to dramatically extend human life) is a stretch, and the idea that Venice could be quarantined in pursuit of a single scientist with such a formula also seems farfetched. This lockdown exists solely to create the crisis that drives the story. Every attempt to escape the city is predictably blocked at the last possible minute, and only when the author is ready to end the story does escape become possible. This book is the equivalent of a summer action movie--its a fun ride as long as you read it at a superficial level.<br /><br />This book could have provided a great deal of food for thought. The book briefly touches on the philosophical issues regarding the benefits/dangers of such a formula, but fails to follow up on them or explore them in any detail.  This conflict between the potential benefits and dangers of such a discovery could have provided a story with greater depth and interest. Instead the book stays focused on the action oriented storyline.<br /><br />Perhaps the book's greatest strength is the setting.  For anyone who has ever visited Venice, the descriptions here should be familiar.  The author clearly researched the setting, and provides an authentic setting for this story.  Too bad the same effort wasn't given to the story itself.	2004-10-06

Perhaps the greatest strength of this book is the biographical material on William Smith.  We are provided with a pretty clear picture of the man and his career, and how he conceived and developed his theories that gave birth to the modern science of geology.  Had the author stayed focused on the biography, this book would be much more concise and enjoyable.  Unfortunately, this book is also a history of the early development of geology as a science, with many digressions into the careers and personalities of the other early English scientists in this field.  Throw in a heavy amount of geological details and a completely superfluous chapter about the author's attempts to retrace Smith's travels, and Smith's story becomes lost in a maze of distracting details, most of which aren't necessary to appreciate the contributions Smith made, or the story of his life.  Also, for someone not intimitely familiar with English geography, it is difficult to visualize the relative locations of much of this narrative.  A basic map showing the various towns, cities and regions would have been helpful to those of us with only the most general sense of the layout of the English countryside.	2004-10-01

Given the success of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, much of the material here is now pretty well known and commonly accepted.  It was quite enlightening to be reminded that the investigation of these crimes was once treated very differently.  Hazelwood's focus on research helped him develop new tools and techniques that have terrifically improved both the ability to capture these deviant criminals, as well as the reputations of the dedicated investigators who persue them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the author's tendancy to jump around significantly weakens the book.  He repeatedly interrupts his descriptions of various investigations to insert details from other investigations.  While it looks like he's attempting to show the parallels that enabled Hazelwood to develop his theories, it makes it difficult to keep the details straight and is sometimes quite confusing.  Several times I found myself backing up and re-reading sections to clarify the point the author was trying to make.<br /><br />This book, by its very nature, includes a great deal of disturbing material.  Readers that do not care for violence or graphic content should be aware that they are likely to find this book highly uncomfortable.  I would also suggest that this book is appropriate only for the most mature young readers.	2004-09-22

Clearly this book was written with tongue firmly planted in cheek, it has to be read with the same mindset.  This probably would have been much more effective if Adams had focused on his strengths, namely the world of work.  The sections dealing with the worlds of work and business are by far the most effective sections of this book.  While the convoluted logic used in the other sections are amusing, it often feels like Adams is trying too hard to be funny.<br /><br />In the final chapter (\\"A New View of the Future\\") Adams steps out of his role as a humorist and provides some serious food for thought.  I found this to be the most effective part of the book.  His argument that finding alternative ways to perceive the universe can be empowering is actually quite persuasive, and his examples of such alternative perceptions are intiguing.  If nothing else, it is helpful to be reminded that our current understanding of our world could prove to be just as inaccurate as earlier views of the universe.  I read this expecting little more than some light entertainment, but I've come away with some serious food for thought...	2004-09-10

Overall, I think this improves the book.  I'm not sure that I need (or want) to know every little flaw in Eisenhower's life.  Instead, this book explores his background and tries to shed some light on those aspects of his personality that influenced his actions and his career path.  We also get a better insight into how his various postings throughout his army career prepared him not only for Supreme Command during WWII, but ultimately for the presidency.  While I found the author to be a little guilty of \\"hero worship,\\" and somewhat too quick to dismiss the charges of Ike's critics, the author does a good job of using Eisenhower's own words (taken from both official and personal correspondence) to make his arguments.  This book is certainly a strong argument that Eisenhower should be ranked among the \\"Greats\\" of American history.	2004-09-07

Beautifully written, with evocative imagery, this book really draws you into the setting. The dream sequence in the first chapter draws you in, but the web of secrets, lies and deceit keeps you reading. It seems that every character has a secret or is lying about something, and the author slowly unveils the truth at a pace that draws you further and further into the story. This is an excellent first novel, and hopefully it won't be this author's last.	2004-08-26

When I saw this book, I had to buy a copy, to read another perspective on this crucial confrontation in the early days of the Cold War.<br /><br /> While Leon Uris's \\"Armegeddon\\" told the larger story of the allied occupation of Germany and the beginnings of the Cold War, this book takes a much more narrow focus. Spencer focuses on a small cast of characters in Berlin, or working the airlift during the Soviet blockade of the city in 1948-49. This narrower focus helps show the effects of the blockade on the residents of Berlin, and the struggle of the crews to ferry sufficient supplies into the city in the face of fatigue, weather, and accidents. We also get a glimpse of the emotional toll that such extreme circumstances can have on personal relationships. This is a great book for anyone who wants to understand the dynamics of the early days of the Cold War, and the impact it had on the lives of those along the front lines in occupied Germany.	2004-08-21

The story centers around the construction of a cathedral and a number of people from the surrounding communities. This book portrays life in this period as a brutal struggle to survive, especially for the poorest members of society. The ongoing civil war that marked the reign of King Stephen allowed brutally violent men to curry favor and exercise their will. This book also shows the power stuggles between the Church and the King that ultimately lead to the martyrdom of St. Thomas Beckett.<br /><br />This book includes some graphic descriptions of some truly brutal acts of violence, including a rather graphic rape scene. However, the violence described here is reflects the reality of the period, and serves the story by showing us the violent nature of many of the people of the time. We get a much clearer picture of the period, and the types of people who took advantage of the times. I don't believe in banning books, but this book includes content that is not appropriate for everyone, and I would recommend parental guidance for younger readers.	2004-08-16

While there were some amusing tidbits, it wasn't nearly as funny as I had been led to expect.

Told from the alien point-of-view, it illustrates the dangers that prejudice and fear create when alien species first meet.<br /><br />Foster does a good job of describing a insectoid civilization, and provides great insight into the traits of such a species.  It is especially interesting to note the relative relationship of mammals on this world, and the attitudes towards them.  This sets the stage for the potential conflict when contact with Earth's humans.<br /><br />This book holds a mirror up to our own prejudices and attitudes and serves as a cautionary tale about making quick judgements when encountering new cultures.  It is all too easy for misunderstandings to create enemies, when patience might lead to understanding and friendship.	2004-08-09

I enjoy Tim Allen's humor and thought his show was pretty good, and was expecting more of the same in this book.  There is a lot of very funny material in this book, and I frequently laughed out loud. I especially enjoyed the chapter entitled \\"The Secrets Men Never Tell Women\\" (no, I'm not going to tell--you'll have to read the book!). Surprisingly, though, Tim Allen also reveals a philosophical side here as well. Parts of this book are quite thoughtful and reflective, and show a surprising depth. I definitely can relate to much of the material in the chapter on fatherhood. This is a fun book that also provides a little food for thought.	2004-08-08

Pieczenik is the co-creator of Tom Clancy's Op-Center books, which I've enjoyed. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this book. The dialogue in the first few chapters feels forced. Eventually the action picked up and the book became more fun, but the first third or so was really difficult to get through. I also found the timelines difficult to believe. Each chapter begins with a location and time stamp. However, the elapsed time doesn't seem long enough for the characters to have covered the distance between story locations. This was so bad that I ended up just ignoring the time stamps completely. Once the action picks up, this isn't a bad thriller, but it starts too slowly, and has too many inconsistencies to be an outstanding book.	2004-08-08

I must confess to not having known much of what occurred between the end of the War for Independence and the drafting of the constitution. This book helps illuminate this very unstable period in U.S. history and highlights the flaws in the Articles of Confederation. We see how the political struggles between those who wanted a strong central government (including Madison, Hamilton, and Jay) and those who favored a looser coalition of states shaped the compromises that created our constitution. I also learned a great deal more about Madison, Hamilton, and Jay and their roles in bringing the constitution into existance. Very informative!	2004-08-08

While it is funny, it really just brushes the surface of its subject matter and never tackles them at any great depth.  In a way this is a shame, as relationships provide so many opportunities for stories.  This book was clearly intended to take advantage of the success of Reiser's television show, but doesn't provide any additional insights or much in the way of new material.

If this book is typical of his writing, it won't be my last.  The group of scoundrels in this story are not the type of characters I ordinarily would find sympathetic, but these ne'er-do-wells have their own kind of honor and a moral code of sorts.

I found Feynman's thesis that doubt (or, more precisely, uncertainty) is the motivation that drives progress in science to be very interesting. In a sense, this relates to the axiom &quot;the more you know, the more you don't know.&quot; Every answer that we learn from science raises additional questions that need to be explored.<br /><br /> I also found Feynman's analysis of religion to be interesting as well. His three aspects of religion (metaphysical, ethical, and inspirational) show promise in helping me to better understand some of my own (often contradictory) attitudes about religion. This section is probably the section that will provide me with the most food for reflection.<br /><br /> Finally, his discussion of issues in society actually reminds me of the arguments in &quot;Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences&quot; by John Allen Paulos. In both cases, the failure of people to grasp basic fundamental principles of science or mathematics leads them to behave in ways that aren't necessarily in their best interests.	2004-08-05

Modessitt's writing has matured since he started the \\"Recluse\\" series, and this first book of the \\"Spellsong\\" series is more coherent than \\"The Magic of Recluse\\" was. It was also nice that Modesitt has finally moved beyond the young-hero-coming-of-age mold that forms the \\"Recluse\\" series. Here, our heroine starts out as a more mature woman, thrust against her wishes into a war in a strange world. We follow as she learns to adapt to her new surroundings and finds that she has skills that she can use to help shape her own destiny, as well as the course of history on this world.

It was a great pleasure to return to Middle-Earth to make this epic journey again. Tolkein's attention to detail, in particular to the development of the history and backstory, pay huge dividends in making this story believable. You can't help but be drawn into this quest to save the world. Tolkein's characters are complex and even his heros don't always get along. The story is full of surprises, some of them pleasant, others, not so much.

I found this book to be very enlightening in describing the conditions in France prior to the Revolution and explaining the motivations and reasons behind the Revolution.  These early portions were by far the strongest part of the book.  However, I found the subsequent descriptions of the events of the Revolution to be confusing.  Part of that may be due to the confusion of the Revolution itself, but it was hard to keep track of all the various individuals involved and their various relationships to each other.  The book's ending was also somewhat disappointing, as it never really described how the Revolution ended with the rise of Napoleon.  It seems that at least a little discussion of the relationship of the Revolution and Napoleon would have been appropriate here, but then again, the book was plenty long enough without it!  Overall, an educational book, especially in the opening chapters.	2004-08-04

In the second half of the book, we follow Frodo and Sam as they struggle to complete their quest to destroy the One Ring.<br /><br /> Here we see the forces of good beginning to gather to combat the growing evil in the world. The underlying themes regarding this struggle become more clear as we begin to recognize that sometimes the only way to overcome evil is by standing up and fighting it. Tolkein's world remains a vividly portrayed as ever, and the tension builds as the heros struggle to conquer the awesome power of Sauron.	2004-08-04

I had never really thought through the implications of growing up during the Depression and then mobilizing for the war effort, and how these experiences led to the changes the members of this generation brought about in our society. This book does just that. I developed a deeper appreciation for the ways the experiences of their youth led to the later accomplishments of that generation.<br /><br /> This book is a tremendously respectful tribute to the men and women who grew up during the Depression, and came of age during the second world war. Whether they were destined for greatness or fame, or were ordinary citizens, this book provides insights into these remarkable lives and shows the lasting effects of those early life experiences. I have often wondered how I would have reacted had I been faced with challenges such as those faced by Brokaw's &quot;Greatest Generation.&quot; I am thankful that I have not been asked to make such sacrifices, but I also wonder if that lack of a &quot;trial by fire&quot; won't have a long term impact on the accompishments of my generation.	2004-08-03

In addition, his experiences are somewhat dated and don't really reflect the current reality (in particular, his comments about the traffic don't ring true).<br /><br /> However, the clash of cultures described here is amusing, and Severgnini does provide some interesting insights into American culture, as seen by an outsider. Overall, this book is sympathetic to America, and it seems to go out of its way to avoid any appearance of mean-spiritedness. Perhaps a little criticism might have balanced the book and provided a more realistic assessment of how we appear to others.<br /><br /> An enjoyable light read, especially if you find culture clashes amusing, but if you are looking for a more detailed critique of American culture and society, you'll have to look elsewhere.	2004-08-03

In a future where entertainment caters to the lowest common denominator, and in which books are forbidden, the job of the fireman is to burn contraband books. However, Guy Montag has a secret...he's a fireman who reads books. When his secret comes out, he has to flee for his life.<br /><br /> Bradbury's writing is wonderfully evocative, painting clear pictures of his vision of a dark future. In this era of &quot;reality television,&quot; this book has a definite prophetic feeling to it, as if we were actually well on the way down the road Bradbury warns us about. The importance of books and literacy for preserving knowledge and ideas must never be forgotten.	2004-08-03

Others are skeptical, refusing to believe in &quot;ghost stories.&quot; However, this phantom actually exists, and when his love for music becomes an obsession for one of the opera's singers, things begin to go terribly wrong.<br /><br /> This is a rather dark story about the power of love, music, and obsession, and the forces that drive people's lives. The writing is nineteenth century in style, full of rich imagery and eloquent dialog. While not as easy for a modern reader to read, it evokes a great deal of emotion, and steadily builds the tension to the climax. Along the way, we learn who the phantom is and why he hides below the opera. Fans of the musical will find a wealth of additional detail here.	2004-08-03

This one isn't different. The prospect of terrorists obtaining and using nuclear material is daunting, and the job of preventing such a disaster even more so. This book isn't quite as gripping as some of the earlier books in the series, but it did present a few surprises, and it wrapped up the story nicely. This book placed some of the Op-Center staff in new roles in the field, which was refreshing, and it introduced at least one new character that I suspect will return in future volumes. This was a fun, light read, perfect for any fan of espionage/political thrillers.	2004-08-02

The concept of infinitely branching time streams helps to resolve the apparent paradoxes of time travel, and creates some mind boggling-possibilities.  The descriptions of time travel and the fabric of time are probably the greatest strengths of this book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, rather than use time travel as a tool to explore history or to improve the human condition, the main character turns inward.  His relationships with the other time travelling versions of himself bring a whole new meaning to narcissism.  This extreme level of self-centeredness is unattractive and it was difficult to feel sympathetic towards him.  This concept of time travel had great potential, but the selfishness of the main character weakens the story.  Also, the sexual content of this story definitely makes this a book for a mature reader, and might be offensive to some readers.	2004-08-02

Very little in this story is quite as it first seems, and the twists keep coming until the very end.  Card's storytelling skill draw you into the settings and take you along for the ride.  His attention to detail is also impressive.  I lived near the Northern Virginia locations in this book during to period the story is set, and I found all of his descriptions to be absolutely accurate!  If you have enjoyed other works by Card, then you probably will enjoy this one as well.	2004-08-02

How I managed to get through school without reading this is a mystery, but the loss was very much mine. This book is a treasure.<br /><br /> Set in the deep South in the 1930's, this book clearly describes both the extreme poverty and the prevalent racism of that period. Yet, this is a hopeful story that shows that even in the midst of these conditions, there are good people who will stand up for what is right. Well written, with terrific imagery, this book is both easy to read and gripping in its emotional content. The story is narrated from a child's point of view, and we witness her growing awareness of the racist issues dividing her community. Her loss of innocence is tempered by her respect for her father and his compassion.<br /><br /> This book addresses important issues about compassion and fairness, and how they can be used to fight hatred. It shows that even in times and places of great prejudice, there can still exist individuals who can rise above these evils.	2004-08-02

While the plot line provided some excitement and a surprise or two, this just wasn't as satisfying as some of the other series created by Clancy.  The near future setting and the use of virtual reality both felt somewhat contrived.  I'm not sure how the use of virtual reality scenarios improves the investigative abilities of the forensic computer analysts.  I found the passages describing these scenarios to be distracting from the main plot line.  Also, while I have no problem with character development, why do we need to have TWO love story subplots?  It felt like overkill.  Overall, this wasn't a terrible light read, but its far from the best thriller I've ever read.	2004-07-30

As a former EMT, I was expecting to find a lot of common ground in this book, and was somewhat surprised at how little I found.  Sure, the job is basically the same, and some of her calls are earily similar to some of mine, but her point of view is very different from mine.  This isn't a bad thing, though, as it was a good reminder that individuals are unique, and that their stories, however similar, are also unique.<br /><br />While this book does give some insight into the life of a volunteer EMT, I would caution readers not to assume that Stern's experiences are typical.  This is also a good story about personal growth and one person's struggle with her demons.  In many ways, these are the book's greatest strengths.<br /><br />One final point...while the use of the coarse language certainly is an accurate depiction of how firefighters and EMTs talk, here it came across as gratuitous.  Some readers might find it offensive, and its use doesn't seem serve the story.	2004-07-30

Anyone who has read Dr. Seuss (and, honestly, who hasn't?) knows that his books include a great deal of political and/or social commentary disguised as children's stories.  What many people don't know is that Dr. Suess started as an advertising copy writer and, early in World War II, worked as an editorial cartoonist.<br /><br />This is a collection of some of his best editorial cartoons from that period, together with a detail commentary that helps to place them in their historical context.  These cartoons show that Dr. Seuss was bitterly opposed to isolationism, and was clearly way ahead of his time with respect to civil rights.  Ironically, however, he demonstrates a distinct bias against the Japanese that almost feels racist.<br /><br />This is a facinating glimpse into a largely overlooked chapter of a celebrated artist's career, and should be required reading for anyone who wants a better understanding of Dr. Seuss, the man.	2004-07-30

Reading this book was like taking a walk down memory lane.  I grew up in a small rural community, and was a member of the local voluteer fire department for several years.  It was almost scary how much of this book could have been written about my experiences.<br /><br />Here we get an honest look at what life in a rural community is like.  Everyone in town knows everybody else, secrets are hard to keep, and changes come slowly.  In this environment, firefighters are taking care of friends and family, rather than strangers, which makes the work all the more rewarding.<br /><br />Perry's writing is easy to read, and includes a healthy dose of humor that offsets the inevitable tragedy that goes hand-in-hand with being a firefighter.  Well done.	2004-07-30

Rudolf Vrba survived almost two years as a prisoner in this extermination camp, and witnessed almost every aspect of the its operation.  Here he details his capture, day-to-day survival, and eventual escape. This is both a horrifying eye-witness account of one of humankind's most evil undertakings and a testament to the spirit of survival that allowed a few to escape certain death.<br /><br />This book is not for the faint of heart, as it does not shy away from the brutal and shocking truth of Auschwitz. At the same time the writing is compelling, and I found it extremely difficult to put it down. This book transported me to the concentration camp in a way no other book ever has. While it does not provide any insights into the roots of the Halocaust, it does illuminate its horrifying consequences.	2004-07-30

This world view is extremely well thought out, and I had to keep reminding myself that it was written before World War II broke out. It reads more like an alternate history written after the war, rather than an extrapolation from before the war. While it would be easy to find the subject matter of this book depressing, in the end I was actually left with positive feelings. This is an optimistic message about the resilience of humanity, even in the face of overwhelming odds. Even after being buried and denied for centuries, the Truth survives and continues to find people willing to sacrifice themselves for It.	2004-07-30

Jim Carroll was clearly a gifted writer, and his diary brings the New York City streets of the mid-60's to life. His vivid descriptions of growing up as a street wise kid on the mean streets of the city clearly paint a picture of the period.<br /><br />That said, this is was NOT a fun book to read. There is much about Carroll's life in this period that is not pretty. His growing dependency on drugs is readily apparent as the book progresses, as is his willingness to do almost anything to pay for his next fix. There are graphic descriptions of both the drug use and his sexual encounters, but even so there is a sense of honesty in the account that somehow seems to be redeeming. In the end, this is a powerful glimpse into a life on the streets.	2004-07-30

I was a volunteer EMT for 12 years, but NYC is an entirely different world.  Shapiro shows us what motivates those people who work to save lives in the busiest city in the nation.  While I never had to deal with the extremes described by Shapiro, this book still reflects my experiences in its humor and spirit.  This is definitely recommended reading for anyone who wants to explore the live and motivations of the dedicated men and woman of our Emergency Medical Services.	2004-07-30

However, the earth is resource starved, and atomic energy seems to be the only way to achieve these dreams.  This presents a threat to rival societies, where fear of nuclear power lives on in the memory of the ages old horror of the Doom.  Can mankind harness the atom to achieve peace, or is it doomed to repeat its earlier failure and unleash the horror of nuclear weapons?<br /><br />Anderson weaves a global tale, providing credible new societies, each filled with believable characters.  His characters are complex, with varying motivations, and are often flawed in some way.  The primary protagonist matures through the the book from a vain and cocky young pilot to become a force to reshape the course of civilization.  The underlying themes here are quite powerful.  This book explores both the human urge to explore and push into the unknown, as well as the question of whether we can ever restrain our tendancies to harness technology to the purposes of destruction.<br /><br />Anyone not familiar with Anderson's writing style might find portions of this book that are weighted down with excessive descriptions.  However, as a whole, this is a fine story and is not an overly difficult book to read.	2004-07-30

The relationship between Henry and Claire is real, complex, and beautifully told. This relationship is the epitome of &quot;soulmates.&quot; However, their relationship is complicated by Henry's condition, which causes him to randomly jump through time. As a result, Henry and Claire don't experience their relationship in the same sequential order.<br /><br /> This story is not told in chronological order which, together with the frequent switching of point-of-view between Henry and Claire, could have made this book a confusing mess. However, Niffenegger has handled these issues well, and the use of these changes in point-of-view and time frame provide a better appreciation for the challenges faced by Henry and Claire. In the end, the structure of the story just strengthens the book.	2004-07-29

In the &quot;Great War&quot; trilogy, the USA, now allied with Imperial Germany, is looking for revenge against the Confederate States of America and their Canadian and British allies. When war breaks out in Europe, the two American rivals join their allies and open an American theater to the war. Here, in the final book of the trilogy, the war draws to its bloody conclusion, as new tactics based on evolving technology break the brutal stalemate that has defined the years of trench warfare. These breakthroughs rapidly lead to victory, and the victors, bent on revenge, intend to punish their opponents, thus planting the seeds for future hostilities.<br /><br /> Turtledove uses more than a dozen characters to tell this story, representing almost every point of view. We have the stories of civilians, soldiers, and sailors; elisted men and officers; white and black; North, South, and Canadian. We see the sweeping scope of the war on the homefront, as well as on both fronts: In Canada, from Quebec to Ontario to Manitoba; and in the South, from Virginia, to Kentucky and Tenessee, to west of the Mississippi. What most impresses me is that the characters here are real rather than stereotypes. There are characters on both sides that are sympathetic, and just as many on both sides that are despicable. Its hard to decide which side is more right or wrong--they each have virtues and faults. In this, Turtledove's alternate history mirror's reality: There are seldom any easy answers, and most issues are shrouded in layers of grey.<br /><br /> I found this series to be a highly entertaining speculative exercise. His extrapolations seem at least passibly plausible, and it is interesting to see how he fits authentic historical figures into his alternate reality. I look forward to reading his next series, and seeing how he deals with the aftermath of the war.	2004-07-29

He wants to live, but thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him!  Every mission he flies as bombadier for the Army Air Forces could get him killed, and he wants to get out of the war.  Unfortunately, the only way he can get out is if he's crazy, and wanting to get out is proof that he's sane.<br /><br />This is a biting, cynical indictment of beauracracy and the narrow-minded paper-pushers who make it so disfunctional.  From the squadron commander, Major Major, who was promoted based solely on his name, to Colonel Cathcart, who keeps raising the number of missions needed before the crews can go home and volunteering his crews for the most dangerous missions, to General Peckem, who wants to add the bomb groups to his special services command, this book is full of over-the-top characters that are just barely within the realm of believability.  This book is funny and infuriating, at the same time, and reflects the worst traits of any beauracracy.	2004-07-29

In addition to explaining the technical and artistic challenges, the author also shows us how Michelangelo's personality, his family, and outside events all impacted his work. I came away from the book with a much clearer picture of Michelangelo as an individual.<br /><br /> The book also provides a wealth of information about the chaotic state of European, Italian, and Church politics of this period. I found the descriptions of the city of Rome especially interesting. Rome of this period was not a thriving city, but only a shadow of its past glory. It was also a &quot;one company&quot; town where almost everyone's livelihood depended on the Church.<br /><br /> Finally, while I found the descriptions of Rapheal and his work equally fascinating, I'm a bit puzzled by their presence here. The author seems to be trying to describe a rivalry between the two artists, but somehow doesn't quite succeed. While Rapheal clearly is trying to compete with Michelangelo, its not at all clear how this significantly affects Michelangelo. If this book was intended to be about Rapheal, these details would be essential to understanding Rapheal's motives and actions. However, since this book is about Michelangelo, I would expect to see a greater emphasis given to showing how Rapheal impacted the work in the Chapel.	2004-07-29

I'm not sure I've ever read another 500+ plus page novel where the entire story takes place in a single day!  This was a fun book to read, combining art and church history with a classic conspiracy theory and some almost science-fiction technology.  These components are mixed into a page turning story that has a very high momentum and keeps you guessing right up to the end.  I wasn't expecting the ending...I thought the story was wrapping up, but there were still something like 50 pages left.  I was wrong...there were still a couple of big surprises left.  I'm not going to be a spoiler, but this book should satisfy anyone who enjoys a great nail-biting thriller.	2004-07-29

This book was a pretty quick read, and while it covered a lot of ground, the book generally dealt with the issues on a pretty basic level that should be easy for almost everyone to follow. There are important issues in here, dealing with people's inability to properly comprehend probabilities and statistics, as well as the common problems associated with comparing relative magnitudes.  The inability of people to grasp some of these concepts has an impact on their ability to make good decisions, and leads them to develop beliefs that aren't strongly based in reality.  A worthwhile read, if only to emphasize the importance of these concepts.	2004-07-27

I've read a number of WWII era spy thrillers, but never one that took place this late in the war. The author does a terrific job of describing the absolute destruction of the German infrastructure and the collapse of both morale and order as the allied forces closed in on Berlin. This is an eye-opening description of the consequences of Hitler's decision to fight to bitter end.<br /><br />In addition, the author also shows how the events of the closing weeks of the war helped to set the stage for the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States. His description of the efforts of Allen Dulles at minimizing the territorial gains of the Soviets, and the resulting compromises that need to be made with the Germans to facilitate these goals is enlightening. Its interesting to note that, in many ways, the Cold War really began during WWII, when the US and the USSR were still officially allies against Germany.<br /><br />This book was a fast read, and while it doesn't really explore any philosophical issues very deeply, it does help put the waning days of the war in Europe into some historical perspective. Over all, I thought it was a pretty good book.	2004-07-27

Turtledove's alternate history in which the Confederate States of America wins the U.S. Civil War continues. Here he picks up where the Great War series ended. The United States of America and its German allies have defeated the C.S.A. and its allies. Telling the story from the points of view of over a dozen different characters, Turtledove skillfully describes the aftermath of the war in both countries. The C.S.A. suffers under the draconion punitive terms of peace forced upon them by the victors, and suffers runaway inflation and general discontent. In the U.S.A., victory gives way to labor strife and a change of administration shifts the political priorities.<br /><br />Turtledove does a good job of using his alternate history to hold a mirror to our own history. The conditions he describes in the C.S.A. are similar to those of Germany following the first World War, and give rise to a reactionary political party led by a bitter ex-soldier and fueled by racism and violence. He also explores the changing priorities of the victorious, and how they impact various segments of the society.<br /><br />As with all of the books in this series, the multiple viewpoints helps to provide a balanced view of the events, showing pros and cons for both the U.S.A. and the C.S.A. While a future conflict between these two countries does appear to be inevitable, it will be interesting to see what additional parallels Turtledove draws in the remaining books of this series.	2004-07-27

Another interesting point is the difficulty distinguishing between those that actually believe in these treatments and the snake-oil salesmen who are simply out to get rich using the latest &quot;medical advances.&quot; Makes you wonder about some of the current ads you see for new drugs, therapies, or treatments....	2004-07-27
US	52932955	RJUQGKSFIOZUE	0345402871	684823314	Airframe	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Not really about airline safety	Another thrilling Crichton page turner! I was expecting this to be about the dangers of flying, but in the end it left me feeling rather reassured about the safety of air travel. The real suspense in this book arise from the tensions created by the internal company politics in the airplane manufacturer, as well as from the aggressive &quot;reporting&quot; of the tabloid television crew. As usual, Crichton's characters aren't as well developed as I might like, but he knows how to pace a story and sustain interest. Definitely an entertaining read.	2004-07-20
US	52932955	R2DHKJTFG99DLQ	0679444815	786105285	Timeline	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Another typical Crichton thriller	If you enjoyed &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Sphere&quot; then chances are you'll enjoy this book as well. If you haven't liked Crichton's earlier technology extrapolations, you probably won't like this one, for many of the same reasons.<br /> As with many of his earlier works, Crichton takes an idea from the very edges of scientific possibility and attempts to predict a possible new technology. This is Crichton's strength--his imagninative applications of extreme scientific theory.<br /> Unfortunately, all of his stories are then built around similar plot lines. Typically, we have an wealthy eccentric developing this new technology in secret, hoping to use it to become even richer. Introduce a small band of experts, and have something go wrong, trapping the experts in harm's way.<br /> Crichton's other weakness is his character development. While the names and certain details may change, it often feels like he's using the same characters over and over again, and we never really see any meaningful character growth in his stories.<br /> &quot;Timeline&quot; is another Crichton techno-thriller, the literary equivalent of a summer action movie. Its a fun ride, as long as you aren't looking for a great deal of substance. However, if you just want a fast, fun ride, this might fit the bill.	2004-07-20
US	52932955	R2VPKMUAEJWV7Y	0441627404	52422715	The Once and Future King	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A classic with plenty of themes to ponder	I found this to be a terribly slow book to read.  The frequent narrative asides (many extremely anachronistic) were a major distraction and prevented me from settling into a rhythm as I read.  As a result, I found myself easily distracted while trying to read this book.<br />However, it was worth the effort.  T.H. White is exploring a number of significant issues here.  It seems to me, looking at the period in which he was writing, that he was trying to use the Arthur legends as a vehicle to search for some meaning or understanding of the great events of his lifetime (i.e., World Wars I and II).  Is war inevitable?  Can it ever be justified?  What alternatives might be found to avoid it?  These are some of the questions that White confronts in his telling of story of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round table.  In the end, it doesn't seem that White finds any definitive answers.  But he certainly provides plenty of food for thought.	2004-07-13

The narration draws you in and transports you to the streets to ride along with the author.  You can almost smell the smoke...<br />While there are many aspect of this book that are seriously dated (such as the seventies-era street slang and some of the firefighting equipment and procedures), most of this story could still be written today.  This is the gritty reality of firefighting in the toughest sections of an urban center.  You can feel the exhaustion and exhileration mix together as we ride through the decaying ghetto from one fire alarm to the next.  What really stands out in my mind, though, is that Smith never loses his empathy for the people of the South Bronx.  Even with all the abuse he and his company endure, he still understands their plight and wishes he could make their world better.<br />Nothing in my experience can compare with the magnitude of serving an area like the South Bronx, but many aspects of this story still reflect my career.  The commaraderie of the fire station is the same, as is the sense of duty and willingness to risk everything to save a life.  This is a terrific book for anyone looking to understand what it takes to be a firefighter, especially on the busiest city streets in the country.	2004-07-13
US	52932955	R19QSQIFJQLA8K	0345330129	439022701	The Door into Summer	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A great description of the role of patents in technology	Written in the mid-50's, Heinlein was projecting the future for both the 1970's setting and the 2001 setting for this story. While his choices are interesting (and some, such as the ubiquitous ATM's in 2001, are amazingly accurate), what I found most interesting was the role patents play in this story.  Heinlein clearly appreciates the role that patents play in the business world, and makes good use of them as a vehicle for Dan's ultimate revenge. Overall, Heinlein's descriptions of patents and the patenting process remain accurate after almost 50 years, though the patent laws have been tweaked slightly in the last decade. If anything, patents are even more important today than they were in the 1950's (when Heinlein was writting this book the U.S. had issued about 2.5 million patents...today we are rapidly approaching 7 million!).	2004-07-13

I can't shake this feeling that the concept of &quot;police&quot; is anachronistic (which is might not be...I don't know much about the period), and this book reads like it is in the middle of a series (i.e., there are references to earlier events/activities that appear to assume that the reader is already acquainted with them). Overall, this was fun and light, with just enough twists to keep me interested to the end.	2004-07-13
US	52932955	R4LHIL9WQOSHR	0671880314	156284675	Schindler's List	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Portrait of a complex man	I have wanted to see Spielberg's movie for quite some time, and I think I'm glad I read the book first. There is a lot of detail here that almost certainly will be lost in the movie.<br />Initially, there is the complexity that is Oskar Schindler himself. It is fascinating to follow his development from a war profiteer and a major operator in the black market to a man obsessed with saving as many Jewish prisoners as he can. It would be convenient to view Schindler as an industrialist using the Jewish prisoners as a cheap source of labor to boost his profits, but it is quite clear that he ultimately was willing to pay any price to save people. His actions could have easily cost him his life. One the other hand, care must be taken to recongize that Schindler was not a saint, but a flawed man who happened to have performed a great deed. His story is truly remarkable.<br />I also found that many of the descriptions of other individuals included fascinating details. Here we find an array of complex and all-too-human characters. Schindler's greatest gift seems to have been his ability to determine what was required to motivate individuals to help Schindler achieve his goals. He was a master a bribery, but could also locate unlikely sources of compassion and conscience. While this is a story that proves that not everyone looked the other way during the Nazi reign of terror, the shame of it is that the numbers of such people were so small.	2004-07-06
US	52932955	R1RQWVAMXXXKLI	1884419410	67340975	The Story of Vajont (Crossings)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A cautionary tale about the dangers of corporate greed	The first time I saw Longaronne, I immediately noticed the church.  Instead of one of the centuries-old churches common to the Italian countryside, Longaronne has a modern church that looks like it could belong in an American suburb.  Later, I would learn about the disaster that washed away most of the town in 1963, including the original church.<br />This book is a narrative re-telling of this disaster.  On October 9, 1963, some 50 million cubic meters of water was displaced over the top of the Vajont dam by a massive landslide.  This wall of water washed away five towns and killed 2,000 people.  Originally considered a natural disaster, subsequent investigations have shown that the risks of such a landslide were known to the operators of the dam prior to the event, and that they consciously chose to ignore the warning signs.<br />This book is not a comprehensive report on the investigation or even a detailed analysis of the errors that resulted in tragedy.  Instead, this narrative focuses on the human elements:  the corporate greed of the builders, the incompetence of the government oversight, and the innocent victims of the tragedy.  It is a tribute to those who died, and a reminder to remain vigilant against repetitions.	2004-06-21
