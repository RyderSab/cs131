Sometimes you get a book and you are overwhelmed at how good it is and some you are overwhelmed by how not so good a book is. This book was the later.<br /><br />I had an opportunity to listen to the audio tape of this book (well parts of it) about a year ago. I went out and bought the whole series based on a small listening of the book. James Marsters did a great job. I love his voice and really was the reason why I went out an bought the series.<br /><br />I wanted to like the series, wanted to praise it like many people who have recommended the books. I like the author he is very nice.<br /><br />However, I just could get into Harry. I didn't like the story line, the plot, the characters, and the over all feeling of the book.<br /><br />I can't identify with Harry nor with anyone in the series. The only interesting character is Bob.	2005-09-11

Gary Neuman puts fear in the hearts of married people. His notion that emotional infidelity is more dangerous than a sexual affair because everyone wants emotional attachments, is more a scare tactic rather than good advice.<br /><br />If you look at his rules, then anyone who has an emotional attachment outside of marriage is guilty of infidelity. Best-friends, close siblings, parents, children from a previous marriage, could all fall into these rules. You could have an emotional affair with your mother or your best friend.<br /><br />Instead of focusing on real issues that cause \\"jealousy\\" Neuman blatantly says that we should avoid and be on guard for those people who might even want a friendship.<br /><br />This whole concept is wrong.<br /><br />There are better books and better sources to read	2005-08-05

It's extremely well done. -Please note there are some spoilers in this review.-- (And the reason why I give it 4 starts instead of 5 is the change of POV which can at times can be confusing and not to mention tiresome- the POV is from the main character who is seeing though her father's eyes at some points. So, for someone who has issues with First Person Narratives, like me, it might be a challenge.) - Not only that but we never learn the name of the storyteller. We know her father's name was Paul and her mother's name which is Helen.<br /><br />Don't look for any romantic notions of Dracula, he is straight up evil in this mystery/romance/journey/historical novel. Dracula is also a collector of books, something that he was in life as in death. In Death he is also a collector of Historians. He wanted to collect a Historian to help him with cataloging his great collection and oversee it, grow it and manage other Historians as well. Dracula, would be busy doing other important evil things.<br /><br />This book takes place, roughly, over three time periods. The 1930s, 1950s and 1970s. In the 30s we learn of Professor Rossi's first encounter, then in the 1950s when Paul and Helen met and finally when Paul and Helen's daughter gets involved when she finds papers in her father's library.<br /><br />The letter starts: My dear and Unfortunate successor.<br /><br />A couple of nits..  The daughter is 16, I am not sure this is a believable age for me. I think I would have been more inclined to see her 18 or 20 in college, but that's me. (I don't know if the author wanted the parents to be still young enough to have a happy ever ending or not, but it was a nit. ) Why does it always have to be a teenager? I don't think this book would appeal to the teenage market because there is a lot of \\"History\\" and lot of pseudo history in article/book form and reads a little like dry academic theory. Chapter 59 (pages 470-484). But don't let that deter you from reading this book it's actually interesting.<br /><br />There is a lot of suspense in the book, you are not sure if Helen is the girl's mother for sometime in the book.<br /><br />The daughter after treading the first page of the papers she is intrigued but puts the papers back but becomes more and more obsessed with hearing the story. She finally goes to her father and he finally tells her part of the story. He doesn't tell her all at first because he is shaken by the events.<br /><br />It takes him several months maybe perhaps over a year to tell his daughter most of it, and there are long stretches when he doesn't say a word.<br /><br />It's dry in some spots and if I wasn't a fast reader it may have lost my interest in parts. Although there are dry spots the interaction and mystery of Paul and Helen (and of course Dracula) kept me reading.<br /><br />The ending is particularly chilling for some reason.hapter 59 (pages 470-484).

The Morrigan is a dynamic and far reaching goddess who appears in many forms.<br /><br />Rankine and D'Este goes far and trying to connect the Morrigan to several goddesses.<br /><br />The only issue that I have with this book is that the authors reach a bit much in some cases to link the Morrigan to many Celtic goddesses and non-Celtic goddesses, such as Andraste, Lamia and the Valkyries.<br /><br />But barring this I would highly recommend this book	2005-07-20

I felt that the book was a \\"exercise\\" in creative writing which was a little frustrating at times. At times I felt that Charlaine Harris played \\"mix and match\\" with Sookie's love interest. I don't mind multiple interests, however what I have issues with is the way it's written. I fell that Charlaine Harris was writing a scene between Sookie and (insert hot guy), at that moment Charlaine Harris leads us to believe that this Hot Guy is Sookie's one and only.<br /><br />But that's not the only reason I have issues with this book. The over all mystery was not as good as I would have liked. The interpersonal relationships that I mainly read for in this series were subpar at best.<br /><br />However, this is popcorn. It's good if you want hot guys, multiple love interests (without logic), and did I mention HOT Vampires....<br /><br />The reason why I gave it three stars- Is because I don't believe that this is worth the money for a hardcover book (although discounted) It would have been 4 stars if it were in paperback.	2005-06-28

Books	3	1	2	N	Y	Not for the novice	The title suggests that this book would talk about the Celtic Goddess, and answer the question as to whether she is a Great Queen or Demon Witch. The book doesn't answer that question, although it reviews Celtic Goddess as they are portrayed in the Mabinogion (pages 69- 187) and Irish folklore, but in the end, I didn't think she answer the question. Another nit pick is that she relays heavily on Robert Graves THE WHITE GODDESS, and ignores the facts that the Celtic Goddesses were not necessarily Mother, Maiden, and Crone - that they might be the Three Maters.<br /><br />In the book she tries to discount Jean Markales  WOMAN OF THE CELTS proposal that the Celts might have been a Matriarchal Society.<br /><br />Little things in this book just stood out like Mor Rigan (for The Morrigan). The study of Lugh/Lew and Bran-I think she spent way to much time on the Celtic Gods. And Lastly she spend time on the Legend of King Arthur. I didn't neccearliy agree with her understanding of Rhiannon - How she might have been a form of Epona-and possibly the Morrigan.<br /><br />Some of her arguments are very unclear and didn't complete follow where she was going. I understood that she wanted to show the development of the Celtic Goddess to Demon Witch but she fails.<br /><br />There are some good things in this book, but it's not the first book that I would pick up if I was to start my journey into mythology. Before you read this book you should have an understanding of the MABINOGION and Irish Folklore.	2005-05-11

I have tried decks like the Faery Wicca Tarot and the Celtic Tarot although I connected to both I was not drawn in by them, like I am the DruidCarft Tarot. I love the book that comes with the cards, it's more than the L(ittle) W(hite) B(ook) that comes with most cards. The means are deep and have a spiritual connection.<br /><br />The Cards are larger than most. The woman in the deck are portrayed strong and able. The Lady (the Empress) is full of life.<br /><br />There are changes such as:<br /><br />The Empresses is now the Lady<br /><br />The Emperor is now the Lord<br /><br />The Hierophant is now the High Priest<br /><br />The Hanging Man is now the Hanged Man<br /><br />Temperance is now the FFryllt<br /><br />The Devil is now Cernunnos<br /><br />Judgment is now Rebirth<br /><br />The Court Cards are<br /><br />Princess<br /><br />Prince<br /><br />Queen<br /><br />King<br /><br />I feel a connection with the cards.

The book says: \\"The card ma represent you, or it may represent someone you know, or someone with whom you are communicating - particularly via electronic media, such as the phone or internet.\\" I think this shows that the creators of the deck are now coming into the new world.<br /><br />I highly recommend these cards.	2005-04-20

I had hopped that Tor romance meant that we would be getting \\"good\\" romance novels. A blend of sci-fi/fantasy/paranormal romance which would break from the traditional 25 year old virgin (or near virgin who had sex once or twice before but it was bad) meets hunky alpha male who has had sex with everyone, when they meet they automatically know they are \\"one and only soul-mates.\\" But disappointingly no, they didn't break the mold, infact they have embraced for the worse, because they give hope only to have it shattered.<br /><br />The Dark Lord is predictable at best. One dimensional bad guy, good girl, and a typical love interest. The love triangle falls flat. The mystery of the book falls flat.<br /><br />The Tarot is superficial-if you expect this book to have anything to do with modern use of the Tarot, you will be extremely disappointed. The author uses stereotypical terms to describe not only Tarot cards but the people who use them.<br /><br />I did have hope for the book but and really wanted to like it, but in the end Tor and the author really let me down.	2005-04-20

I have read with these cards for a few months and they are very much inspiring.<br /><br />I don't recommend these cards to those who are just starting out because the Court Cards and Majors are not named, only distinguishable by the numbers of the majors and numbers and icons for Wands, Pentacles, Swords, and Cups.	2005-04-20

I think they know in this book where they want the character to go, but get bogged down with the characters themselves. The plot is okay and the storyline is interesting.<br /><br />Again I would still say a good starting point for this series is  Sister of the Dead.	2005-04-19

The book has an interesting concept. I love Dhampir but none really can write them well. I liked Magiere and Leesil a great deal that is one part of the book that I did like. I liked their prior relationship and how they have worked together.<br /><br />What I didn't like was the story, if was weak at best. It felt jumbled together as if the authors had these wonderful character to introduce but didn't know how to do it. The Plot of the story was confusing and sometimes dragged out and not truly believable.<br /><br />I do however like the latest installment Sister of the Dead-which I highly recommended and it maybe the true starting point of the series.	2005-04-19

Merry has finally found out about things that were hidden from her, or she wasn't aware of. I don't think Merry books are \\"mysteries\\" I have always saw them as an epic erotic fantasy book with a closed ending and never was simply a private detective series. . This was a great book to get into.<br /><br />She has a tight story, a plot - umm yes, sex can be a part of a plot - the sex is not gratuitous and very well written.	2005-04-19

I picked it up again when several people recommended this book. I gave it another try and found again that this book is lacking.<br /><br />I picked this book because I was intrigued by the BDSM theme of the book. I am very much interested in Alternative lifestyle books especially in the realm of Sci-Fi/Fantasy.<br /><br />I stand by my first impression. My first impression was that Jacqueline Carey liked the idea of having her main character like BDSM but she never gave the reader BDSM. It was more like a tease fade to black. We are told that Phedre like pain with her sex but every time that the book comes close to  showing a BDSM it falls short-it paints a negative view about those who likes BDSM with the only one that is not painted as \\"evil\\" is Phedre herself because she wasn't raised \\"in\\" the proper school and wasn't taught anything about her unique gift from her god. So we get an typical romance heroine who likes a little pain with her straight up sex.<br /><br />The plot was typical and boring. A young girl forced into a life of prostitution because her mother was one before her. She is \\"rescued\\" by a good man who raises her in order to use her. She then sets down the road of court intrigue which is a typical of many books in this genre.<br /><br />As far as the sex, it's fluff, it's nothing to do with  the BDSM culture. Not that I expect Jacqueline Cary to use crude language but the language in the book is very archaic and a bit out of place. She uses Phallic for a male sexual organ. And she use similar jargon to describe the sexual act it's self. It comes out flat and disjointed.<br /><br />I expected to pick this book up and have a world where BDSM was an acceptable way of life, or a lifestyle choice, but Jacqueline Carey painted a very misguiding, un-research, incoherent, and silly picture of people who live in this type of lifestyle.<br /><br />Carey villains seemed a little to contrived, to formulated and too stereotypical Machiavellian. (and too easily defeated and defeated in a stereotypical bland way) and not in a good way. The enemy in the book is clearly marked in the beginning of the book, and gets the to break Phedre - but again it's the stereotypical and a little boring.<br /><br />I would defiantly check this book out in the library, before you buy any books in this series. I bought the whole series because of the recommendation that I received. Don't take my word-I am just venting an alternate view of the book. Judge for yourselves.a little to contrived, to formulated and too stereotypical Machiavellian. (and too easily defeated and defeated in a stereotypical bland way) and not in a good way.

I would have given this book four stars, but I can't help but to give it 5 considering all the negative reviews out there. This book is dramatically different from the first Anita Blake books, however this is going into a direction that I like.<br /><br />Is this book for everyone? No, it's not. Is this a good place for a person to start the series? I tend to start a series (if I know it's a series from book 1, like I did with Anita).<br /><br />Is there a lot of sex in this book? Yes, there is and most of it is very graphic, and it's not romantic fluffy sex. Some reviewer's call it porn or woman's Masturbation book. I disagree. Yes, there is sex in this book, but it's a part of the book. It makes sense. The sex is because Anita is no longer a simple Animator with a boyfriend who is a werewolf and another who is a Master Vampire. She is a powerful Necromancer who is linked preternaturally to a Master Werewolf King (who gave her sexual powers of the Munin) and a Powerful Master and Master of the City Vampire (who gave her the ardeur, which makes her a succubus-a Drinker of passion).<br /><br />When you toss these two together you with the fact that Anita has had an Catholic upbringing in which good girls don't have 5 or 6 much less two men who she is sexually active, not to mention that she refuses to learn how to control the succubus within - You are going to get sex.  And you layer on another complexity, which she inherited from the joining of a powerful Trimative -  That she has part of a \\"were-beast\\" rolling around in her.<br /><br />Anita Blake is not a simple book, it's complicated. The sex is no something so easy like a \\"fantasy\\" flash back in \\"Wayne's World\\" it's apart of the story. It's something that is in the books to say.<br /><br />There is something that I didn't like about the book, that I fine upsetting in many series that I read and that is: Where is the editor? This book needed a good spell checker. Not a content editor but someone who could have taken this document in another computer and checked for miss-spelled words. No one is perfect, and I have Learning Disabilities, but when a book is published it should be run through a secondary machine and then have someone go through it \\"Just in case.\\"<br /><br />The book still gets five stars - because it's so much more than the sex. Anita finally starts to get things.<br /><br />Ceitcould have taken this document in another computer and checked for miss-spelled words.

I like Rachel a tough head strong woman. Ivy, Jenks, Trent are all good characters to base a series with.<br />I like the Ivy/Rachel relationship in the story but that falls flat, it's a tease,  it's like the author just dropped it all together for a more conventional romance.<br />The biggest problem I had with this book is the last part of the book. I felt that the author brought in a character, Nick, just to bring in a typical romance hero good, appearing, guy, who Rachel falls for instantly and trusts without reservation.  I just felt that introduction of the character brought strong confident Rachel to be a weak kneed romance heroine. I believe that Harrison can remedy that in the next book, and I'm looking forward to it.<br />I would strongly recommend this book because it will be a part of a series and the world is solid, the characters with the exception of Nick, are all strong and worth the time to get invested in them.	2004-07-03

The author is very knowledgeable about Irish Myth and Legend, however the story was lacking in originality and likeability of the lead character. The review says it's Medb story but it really is not. The author uses the first person POV from Medb's daughter Finnabair.<br /><br />Finnabair, the main character, is a whinny, unlikable, spoiled brat who thinks that she is better than anyone else. It is a very predicable story, where the romance story heroine puts her very strong powerful mother in her place, and shows her mother the proper woman's place in society; subservient to men. I also didn't like the endings overtone that somehow Christianity saved Ireland.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book.	2004-02-16
