US	33365619	R17TOEK9O17DHJ	0689867662	216454697	Wild Roses	Books	5	13	17	N	N	Another fantastic YA book by Deb Caletti	In my opinion, Deb Caletti is definitely underappreciated - her writing style very much like Sarah Dessen's, but she doesn't get the same recognition that Sarah does. I picked up WILD ROSES without even reading the summary, and I don't regret it at all. <br /> <br />WILD ROSES is about Cassie Morgan, a teenage girl that most readers will be able to relate to: her parents are divorced, she doesn't really like her mom's choice in men (at least, she doesn't like her step-father, world famous violin player, Dino), and she's afraid to fall in love. <br />That is, until Ian Waters comes along. <br />Cassie and Ian have a connection from the second they meet, and her unease with the situation is what makes the book so wonderful - she wants to be closer to him, but at the same time, she's not sure if that's what is best for her. <br /> <br />WILD ROSES is an incredibly realistic story about coping with divorce and falling in love for the first time. However, the book isn't all about being upset over divorce and falling for a boy - the most interesting (and heartbreaking) part is the storyline about Cassie's step-father, Dino, who is a time bomb waiting to go off.  <br /> <br />Deb Caletti is amazing, and if you like Sarah Dessen books, or if you've read Caletti's other books (Honey, Baby, Sweetheart, and The Queen of Everything), you'll love this one too.	2005-10-02

Instead of spending summer vacation hanging out at the beach with her friends, she's working as a babysitter at a fancy hotel for some extra cash. Suze gets assigned to Jack, a lonely, boring, always-nervous eight year old. Jack NEVER wants to do anything but sit inside, and his older brother Paul is a total creep. <br />So, when Suze is off babysitting Jack, her stepfather (Andy) and stepbrother (Brad...aka Dopey) are digging a hole in the backyard to install a hot tub ~ but when Suze is woken up in the middle of the night by an angry ghost, warning her that if the digging doesn't stop there will be \\"hell to pay.\\" Then, after the message from the ghost, Suze's best friend (and longtime crush, Jesse)disappears. Suze is sure that the ghost has something to do with it, and retaliates, but also brings Jack and Paul into the problem. <br /> <br />This book is the best in the series...each one gets better, but DARKEST HOUR still has the honor of being my favorite. The best part? We finally get to find out what happened to Jesse. <br />I totally recommend this book!	2005-08-10

Gina knows all about Suze's mediator thing, and really cautions her to be careful and not to get hurt. But one day when Suze and Gina are buying sodas at a local 7-Eleven type shop, Suze sees four kids in - get this - formal dresses and suits.  <br /> <br />When Suze confronts the four ghosts, they are MAD. They're still hanging around because, well, they were in a car accident, and want to kill the kid that hit their car. The problem is - Suze is going out with him! What will happen with the four ghosts? <br /> <br />I loved this book, but I really can't say much about it, because I don't want to give anything away. <br /> <br />Overall grade: A+	2005-08-04

It wasn't a bad book, but it wasn't necessarily a great book, either. <br /> <br />RAINA'S STORY still goes inside the lives of the three friends from the first book (Kathleen, Raina, and Holly), but the main focus is (obviously) on Raina St. James. RAINA'S STORY explores the relationship between Raina and her mother, her boyfriend Hunter, and Raina's lack of faith.  <br />Everything is going good in Raina's life, until an old boyfriend shows up at her school and threatens to turn everything around. While she's worried about what might happen with him, she throws herself into her volunteer work at the local hospital, where she faces even more challenges, and gets the opportunity to save a woman's life.  <br /> <br />The \\"Angels in Pink\\" series is still something that I enjoy reading, and McDaniel's books are always short enough that you can zip through them in about a day. Unfortunatley, RAINA'S STORY just didn't compare with Kathleen's Story. The \\"surprise ending\\" to this one was really predictable and didn't really leave you waiting for more. Regardless, I'll still be looking forward to the last book, but I'd recommend picking this up from the library instead of buying it.	2005-08-04

CALIFORNIA HOLIDAY isn't a fantastic book, but it was surprisingly cute and entertaining. <br /> <br />Rowan is sick of her family - her brother is annoying and her parents seem to walk on their tiptoes when they're around her. After a few mishaps, Rowan decides that it will be best if she takes a year off before she starts college - partially so she can clear her thoughts and partially because she wants to get away from her family. So she heads off to Seattle to be a nanny for an ultra-rich family.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, things don't work out the way Rowan had intended, and her employers are a handful. Once Rowan reaches her breaking point, she decides that she needs to leave...again. So she heads off in search of a new job and some new friends. <br /> <br />CALIFORNIA HOLIDAY is cute, funny, and an incredibly entertaining book. Yes, it's predictable. Yes, it's cheesy. But in my opinion, it's also Kate Cann's best book yet.	2005-07-31

She wakes up one night to a woman screaming bloody murder, and the woman says \\"Tell Red he didn't kill me.\\" So, Suze is looking all over for Red, and finds one...Red Beaumont, businessman. When she goes to tell him the message, she finds him totally strange - he keeps looking at her neck, doesn't like sunlight, and has no red hair...so why is he called Red?  <br />When Suze tells Father Dom all about this, he comes to the stratling conclusion that Red Beaumont is a vampire. Suze doesn't believe in vampires, but is a little afraid of Red. She goes back there, and ultimately gets into much deeper trouble than she could ever have imagined. <br /> <br />Will Suze get into more trouble than she can handle with the possible vampire? <br /> <br />This book's really good, I'd say better than the first...from the first line (which I believe is \\"Nobody told me about the poison oak\\") to the last, this book is absolutely hilarious. You won't be able to put it down, I highly reccommend this.  <br /> <br />Overall grade: A+	2005-07-31

I was at a bookstore the other day when this woman approached me, handed me a copy of THE IDIOT GIRLS' ACTION-ADVENTURE CLUB, told me that every girl had to read it at some point in her life, and then walked away. I stared after her for a little while, dumbfounded, and then started thumbing through the book. It was one of the weirdest ways I've ever gotten a book, but I absolutely loved it! <br /> <br />Laurie Notaro makes everyday things turn into absolutely hilarious adventures - including going to the gynecologist, fast food restaurants, and using the Internet. THE IDIOT GIRLS' ACTION-ADVENTURE CLUB is an incredibly quick read, since each essay is only about five pages long, tops. Though some of the essays are just so-so, most of them are hysterical. Some of the highlights are \\"More Bread, Please\\" (where Laurie and her friend go to a restaurant and get nothing but rolls), \\"Make Me Laugh, Clown\\" (guaranteed to make any clown-hater laugh!), and \\"The Candy Apple Freak Show.\\"  <br /> <br />In short, all of my friends will be getting a copy of THE IDIOT GIRLS' ACTION-ADVENTURE CLUB for birthday/Christmas presents this year. Highly recommended.	2005-07-24

It's funny, heartbreaking, and easy to relate to...and it doesn't try to glorify being a young adult or falling in love. <br /> <br />After a huge fight with his best friend Sean, Jake decides that he can't ever get into any trouble if he just stops talking altogether. As his friendship with Sean is dying, he becomes closer to his friends Paul, Roger, and Xandra. But when Jake realizes that he doesn't just want to be friends with Xandra, things start getting a bit messy. He doesn't know how to explain himself and he doesn't know what do about it, so...he decides to do nothing.  <br /> <br />Told entirely through notes passed back and forth, I CAN'T TELL YOU is an interesting and original story. The friendships between Jake and Paul, Roger, and Xandra are all incredibly realistic, and the course of a friendship turning into unrequieted love is scarily accurate. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br /> <br />Overall grade: A+	2005-06-24

Unfortunately, as I started reading MATES, DATES, AND SEQUIN SMILES, I relized that the books are getting a bit old.  <br /> <br />MATES, DATES, AND SEQUIN SMILES is another story that revolves around Nesta - the vain, somewhat self-absorbed girl out of the four friends. But when she finds out that she needs to get braces, she's mortified - what guy is ever going to fall for a girl with braces?! Nesta makes a big deal out of getting braces, and decides that nobody can see her until she gets them off. To fill her spare time, she decides to take an acting class that's going to be held at a local school. Nesta figures that there will only be adults taking the class, so she's safe going in public with her braces. Until she meets Luke... <br /> <br />MATES, DATES, AND SEQUIN SMILES was cute, but I really feel like the series is getting a bit old. It's good summer reading, but I'd recommend getting it from the library instead of buying it.	2005-06-23

It's a cute, fun, easy read that teenage girls will love, especially considering the strong female characters. <br /> <br />Miranda has just graduated from high school, and for the first time in her life she's leaving her small town for bigger things - she's going to school in Austin, Texas. With support from her family and (most of) her friends, she heads off...and of course, Austin is nothing like she imagined. After a rough start, though, Miranda makes some new friends (Kathleen, the more alternative-type girl and Missy, the flirt) and things start looking up.  <br /> <br />Miranda still feels like something is missing though, and that's when SHE'S GOT THE BEAT really starts picking up. She decides that she's going to do something completely unlike herself: Miranda signs up for drum lessons.  <br /> <br />SHE'S GOT THE BEAT is a good mix of comedy, music, and romance. Miranda's different encounters with a few (very) different boys are funny and relateable at the same time. <br /> <br />Recommended to fans of How Not to Spend Your Senior Year, the Mates, Dates, and...series, and Royally Jacked. <br /> <br />Overall grade - B	2005-06-21

If they were anything like the Princess Diaries, I knew that they would become some of my favorite books, as well.  <br /> <br />In SHADOWLAND (the first of the Mediator books), Suze Simon moves to sunny, bubbly Californa with her mom. She's moving into an old, historic house that her stepdad and three stepbrothers (Doc, Dopey, and Sleepy) live in. When Suze finds out it's an old mansion, she freaks out. You see, Suze has powers. She can talk to ghosts, in fact, she has to help them go to the afterlife. Suze is right - there's a Spanish cowboy from the 1800's (named Jesse) living in her room. At first, shes kind of alarmed, but soon she becomes friends with Jesse - he watches out for her, and seems to have an attraction to her. <br /> <br />At Suze's new school, there is also a ghost. Heather, the pretty, popular girl who committ suicide the week before Suze arrived. Heather is jealous and seeking revenge on her ex-boyfriend Bryce, and will stop at nothing to kill him. <br /> <br />Suze keeps trying to prevent Heather's attempts to murder Bryce, but in the end - will she succeed? <br /> <br />This was a great book, even better than the Princess Diaries. It's a book that you won't want to put down, and won't be upset at the end. Everything comes together.  <br /> <br />Overall grade: A+	2005-06-20

I found myself getting bored with the plot and wishing the book would end already. <br /> <br />Karen isn't your ordinary teenage girl. She has a \\"third eye,\\" which helps her locate missing children through vivid daydreams/dreams. When she meets a rookie police officer after reporting one of the missing kids, he takes a special interest in Karen and her psychic abilities. Soon they form a friendship, and they also form a bit of a team. He tells Karen when there are known cases of missing kids, and she helps him find them. <br /> <br />This all works for a little while, until something big happens, and Karen finds herself - as well as some missing kids - in danger. <br /> <br />THE THIRD EYE wasn't bad, exactly, but it wasn't good either. It moved really slow, and it was really easy to figure out the \\"twist\\" at the end of the book.  <br /> <br />Rather than recommending this, I'd suggest that newcomers to Ms. Duncan's books should read the two mentioned above or \\"Stranger With My Face.\\" <br /> <br />Overall grade: C-	2005-05-21

They move from New York to South Beach, Florida the summer before they start college, and the trip is a bit of a disaster from the start. Lula is going to stay with her dad, and is planning on getting to know him better, and Jeff is going to be staying with his ultra-strict uncle. When both Jeff and Lula realize that they can't possibly stay where they are, the two of them decide that they have to find an apartment that's relatively cheap. Enter CeCe's Cuban Cafe, a small cafe in South Beach that isn't doing to well business-wise. There's an apartment over the restaurant, and the owner (CeCe) decides that Lula and Jeff can stay there if they offer to work in her restaurant. <br /> <br />SOUTH BEACH SQUEEZE is a cute story about friendship, music, and romance. My favorite thing about the book was all the pop culture references, but it's overall a really enjoyable read. <br /> <br />Overall grade - A	2005-03-25

The story seemed to go on and on, and I was really hoping that Ann Brashares could bring the series back with GIRLS IN PANTS: THE THIRD SUMMER OF THE SISTERHOOD. I loved it, and my faith in Brashares writing has been renewed. <br /> <br />GIRLS IN PANTS takes place during the summer before the four girls go off to college, and they're pretty busy doing their own things.  <br />Tibby is having a lot of trouble dealing with all the change that is going on in her life, and when something happens to her family, she doesn't know what she's going to do. She spends most of the summer worrying about everyone else and being a little bit too self-concious.  <br />Carmen's mom and stepdad have some news that she's not so excited to hear - they're having a baby together. Carmen doesn't want her mom to replace her, and that's exactly how she feels. To get away from the house, she takes on an odd summer job...and ends up meeting - and falling for - the perfect guy. <br />Lena's taking an art class and working at a Greek restaurant, while trying to prove to her parents that she really, really wants to make a living off of her artwork. <br />And finally, Bridget is working at a soccer camp, and when she meets up with someone she thought she had \\"forgotten\\" about, she finds herself confused and feeling alone. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed GIRLS IN PANTS, and it got me pretty excited to see the new movie that's coming out (based on the first book, starring Alexis Bledel from Gilmore Girls). I recommend it, although the first fifty pages were kind of hard to get interested in. <br /> <br />Overall grade - A-	2005-03-20

I picked it up expecting it to be your typical, not-as-good-as-the-original sequel, but I enjoyed it just as much as Royally Jacked. <br /> <br />SPIN CONTROL takes place in Vienna, Virginia this time, and it focuses more on the relationship that Val has with her mom and how she deals with her mom's new girlfriend. When Val's friends find out the real reason her parents got divorced, she's surprised to see that they're all supportive of her mom's decision, and they promise not to tell anyone else until Valerie is ready. <br /> <br />Valerie isn't really sure what's going on between her and Georg, but when her friend Christie tells her that she has an opportunity to go out with her longtime crush, David, Val seizes the opportunity. But when the date goes better than expected, Val has to make one of the toughest decisions yet: David or Georg? <br /> <br />SPIN CONTROL is hilarious, cute, and refreshing. Although you know how it will end, it's still a great read. <br /> <br />Overall grade - B+	2005-03-06

It was cute, but I had a lot of trouble getting interested in the story at first. After I got through the first 30 pages or so, I thought it was a cute and original story. <br /> <br />EYELINER OF THE GODS is about Jan James, who is a wanna-be tabloid reporter. She gets offered a chance to go on an archaeological dig in Egypt, and she accepts. Her trip doesn't start out too well - she gets lost, mugged, and cheated out of some money. But after she meets - and falls for - Seth, things start looking up. Until Jan learns that an ancient curse is putting a damper on her plans, and she could be in danger. <br /> <br />EYELINER OF THE GODS is cute, it's a comedy/romance that also has a bit of a mystery to it. Jan is a very likeable character, but the book was kind of slow in certain parts. I enjoyed it, but was glad I had only picked it up from the library. <br /> <br />Overall grade - C+	2005-03-02

KATHLEEN'S STORY is the start of a new series (Angels in Pink), and even though its your typical teen romance/drama book, I loved it. <br /> <br />Kathleen isn't too happy when her friends Raina and Holly decide to volunteer at the hospital over the summer, but she gets sucked into doing it too. The reason Kathleen is so reluctant to go with them is simple - her father was killed in a car accident and her mom has multiple sclerosis (MS), and Kathleen thinks she's seen far too many hospitals before. Over the course of the summer, the three friends go through a lot - boyfriends, new friends, perks of their new job, and a possibly life-changing decision.  <br /> <br />When Kathleen starts to hang out with - and fall for - the \\"bad boy\\" of the volunteer program (Carson Keifer), she thinks the summer is going to be great. Until she meets his friend Steffie, who's prettier than Kathleen, and she's also a model. Kathleen isn't sure what she wants anymore, and her friends try to help her out along the way. <br /> <br />KATHLEEN'S STORY is good, and it isn't as sad as most of McDaniel's books. It's a book you can only read once or twice, though, so I'd get it from the library (or wait until it comes out in paperback, so you won't be paying too much for it).

Cathy Hopkins is a good author, but it seems like this series is about to end. MATES, DATES, AND MAD MISTAKES is cute, but nothing special. <br /> <br />Izzie feels a little different from the rest of her friends - she wants to try more wild and crazy things (like drinking and getting her belly-button pierced without parental consent), but she's still the same fun character. When Izzie starts testing her limits, though, she starts to get into trouble. She's met this guy, Josh, and he's encouraging her to do a ton of things she wouldn't normally do. Her friends (and parents) recognize that she's fallen into a downward spiral, but they can't do anything to change her mind. <br /> <br />MATES, DATES, AND MAD MISTAKES is one of the more serious books, with Izzie getting into drinking, smoking, drugs, and lying to her mom and stepdad. I wouldn't say the book is bad, but for all the problems that Izzie faces, the ending was too sugarcoated. Also, I miss the Izzie from the older books - the one that was into all the astrology, tarot cards, etc. In MATES, DATES, AND MAD MISTAKES, Izzie barely even mentions any of the things she loved in the first books. <br /> <br />I'd recommend getting it from the library, but I wouldn't buy it. <br /> <br />Overall grade - C	2005-02-05

Finally, after almost getting it about five times, I picked it up. All I can say is, I'm sorry that I didn't pick it up sooner. <br /> <br />Valerie isn't having the time of her life in high school, but she's not exactly a social leper, either. She has a small group of friends, but for the most part she's unknown. So when her parents get divorced (which would be bad enough, but her mom chose to leave her father...for another woman. In a small-ish town, this is big news, and Valerie is afraid of what all her peers will think about her.), she only has her three best friends to rely on. Until she finds out that she has two choices: move into a new apartment with her mom and Gabriella (her mom's girlfriend), or live with her dad...in a foreign country. <br /> <br />Valerie decides that she wants to live with her dad, because she'd rather not see her mom happy with anyone but her father. In Schwerinborg (the country that she's moving to with her dad) she meets - and falls for - Georg. Val thinks their relationship is great, until her dad tells her that Georg is actually the prince's son.  <br /> <br />ROYALLY JACKED is a great book, with a hilarious plot, an original idea (minus the whole falling for a prince scenario), and memorable characters. I recommend ROYALLY JACKED to fans of The Princess Diaries, How Not to Spend Your Senior Year, and The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. <br /> <br />Overall grade - A-	2005-02-05

This time, the book is about Heather Barlow's younger sister Amber, which is a nice change from the original. <br /> <br />After Heather returns from Africa, she doesn't feel like the same person she was beforehand - she saw things most people her age couldn't imagine, and she lost someone she loved more than anything. Amber is having her own problems, though, and she feels like nobody in her family really cares about them, because they're all so concerned about Heather.  <br /> <br />When Heather becomes sick and can't go back to Africa on a new mission trip that she had planned on (and her mom was going to go along this time, as well), Amber decides that she has to take Heather's place. Amber thinks that she'll figure out what she wants to do with her life, and that the mission trip will be pretty easy. When Amber and her mom get to Africa, though, she realizes that those ideas were wrong.  <br /> <br />ANGEL OF HOPE goes between the story of Amber learning a lot about herself and her time in Africa, as well as Amber's family being effected by the mysterious illness that Heather is suffering from.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended if you like Lurlene McDaniel, or if you enjoyed Angel of Mercy.

At the library a few weeks ago, I saw a copy of CRUEL SACRIFICE, and since I've been really into true crime books lately, I decided to give this one a shot.<br /><br />CRUEL SACRIFICE not only gives a very good account of the murder of Shanda Sharer, but a good portion of the book describes the four murderers (no, I won't refer to them as the four girls, or the four teenagers, because what they did was beyond disgusting) home lives. Melinda Loveless and Laurie Tackett's stories are much more detailed than Toni Lawrence and Hope Rippey's, mostly because they were the two \\"in charge.\\" The stories from the Loveless family are incredibly disturbing as well, but they don't offer any excuse for Melinda's actions.<br /><br />CRUEL SACRIFICE is a very good book, but it definately starts to drag on at parts. The photographs are really haunting, because looking at them you can't help but think \\"How could someone that looks so normal, like someone I would see at my school...how could they do such a thing?\\" I'd recommend it to anyone that's familiar with the case, or that likes true crime books. It's one of the most tragic books I've read in a while, because nobody deserves to be killed at such a young age (Sharer was only twelve years old at the time).<br /><br />Overall grade - B	2005-01-07

To \\"make up\\" for her lifestyle, she decides to go to Africa with a mission group where she can make a real difference in someone else's life. On the trip, she makes tons of new friends - Ian, Ingrid, Boyce, and so many others - that feel the same way that she does. Heather isn't prepared for everything she faces, though, and when tragedy strikes, she has to rely on her new friends and her faith to guide her through it. <br /> <br />McDaniel has created (yet another) winning book with ANGEL OF MERCY. It's nice to see that she strayed from her usual topics of kids with lukemia, diabetes, and other various diseases. This book also has a more religious plot outline, which is different from most of her books. As I said, ANGEL OF MERCY is a heartwarming story that teens will enjoy. <br /> <br />Overall grade - A	2004-12-28

Kinsella has created a character that is incredibly quirky and somewhat annoying, but is still loveable. SHOPAHOLIC AND SISTER breathes new life into the Shopaholic series, and gives the readers a fun and carefree read. <br /> <br />Becky and Luke are on their honeymoon - in fact, they've been honeymooning for ten months. They've gone to India, South America, North America, Denmark, and many more countries. The book starts off with the two in Sri Lanka, where they're participating in a yoga/meditation clinic. Becky and Luke have never been happier - Luke's relaxed (instead of being busy and worried about his business) and having a good time, and Becky can't believe how great the shopping is in all these countries! <br /> <br />When Becky decides that she would like to go home earlier than planned so she can attend her best friend Suze's twins' Christening, Luke is all for it. That way he can get a head start on some more work. <br /> <br />Their surprise visit to Becky's parents doesn't go too well, but she's so excited to see Suze that she ignores the weird way her parents were acting. But Suze has changed too! Her new best friend, Lulu, has totally changed her! <br /> <br />Just as Becky thinks things can't get worse, her parents tell her something. She has a long lost sister named Jess! Becky is excited - now she'll have someone to joke around with, shop with, and have sleepovers with...until she meets Jess, who isn't anything like Becky imagined she would be. <br /> <br />SHOPAHOLIC AND SISTER is hilarious. Becky is still a strong, funny character that everyone can relate to in one way or another. Highly recommended. <br /> <br />Overall grade - B	2004-12-25

THE ALISON RULES is a more serious book, and because of that it starts off a little slowly. But after a while, it begins to pick up, and I couldn't put the book down.    THE ALISON RULES is about high school sophomore Alison and her best friend Laurie. Not long ago, Alison's mother died, and she's having a heck of a time coping. Laurie's the funny, outgoing, playful one - and she tries to get Alison to cope, but she's not overly pushy. Alison is more introverted and quiet, and she thinks that just avoiding everything that reminds her of her mom will make her pain go away.    Halfway through the school year Patrick Kirk (or Patrick Kirkpatrick, as Laurie calls him) transferrs into their geometry class. The two girls befriend him, and also start to fall for him.     On a class trip to Boston, Laurie tells Patrick how Alison's mom died (this is how the reader finds out, as well) and then the two girls are in a huge arguement. But a little while later, something happens that will - oddly enough - help Alison learn how to cope with losing her mom.    THE ALISON RULES is an amazing book - its more serious than Ms. Clark's other books, but its also more touching and heartfelt. I couldn't put it down after a while. Warning: you might want to keep a box of Kleenex handy - I was crying like a baby during this book.    Overall grade - A+	2004-12-18

I picked up THE DARK AND DEADLY POOL expecting a lot, and maybe that's why I was so let down. <br /> <br />THE DARK AND DEADLY POOL takes place at the Ridley Hotel, where Elizabeth (or Liz) Rafferty works in the pool area. She cleans up and puts out fresh towels most of the time, but sometimes she has to act as a lifeguard. One night, Liz is closing up the pool area and something happens. Someone - or something - grabs Liz's ankle. When she knows nobody is in the room with her. So what was it? <br /> <br />Liz goes on a mission to find out who the person in the pool was. She makes a new friend on the way Fran (the boy that happens to be a good 4 inches shorter than her, but is also in love with her) - he's the most memorable character in the book.  <br /> <br />THE DARK AND DEADLY POOL is a good book - with memorable characters and a unique setting. So why only three stars? It moved really slowly and the ending was predictable. I'd recommend checking out Joan Lowry Nixon's other books, but maybe getting this one from the library. <br /> <br />Overall grade - C	2004-12-09

STRANGER WITH MY FACE is amazing - incredibly suspenseful, creepy, and you will not be able to put it down. In my opinion, it is one of her best books (right next to Down a Dark Hall, my favorite one yet).    Laurie doesn't know why everyone keeps saying they see her walking around town when she was sick, and sleeping all day. Her boyfriend's mad because he saw her with another boy, her dad claims he saw her walking around the house when she should be at school, and Jeff (the mysterious, moody guy) swears he saw her walking out on the rocks by her house - something really, really dangerous. Laurie knows she was never doing these things, but nobody believes her.    Soon though, she tells her newest friend Helen about everything, and she's able to come up with an answer. Astral projetion. There's someone out there that looks EXACTLY like Laurie, and she's projecting herself to Cliff House (Laurie's home).     STRANGER WITH MY FACE is great, and I loved the topic. Astral projection is something that fascinates me  (it was the idea behind an episode of the Disney TV show \\"So Weird,\\" which has been off the air for a while now), and it makes a great storyline. Highly recommended.    Overall grade - A	2004-11-07

While the characters and story aren't as memorable as the characters from her previous book, PRINCESSES DON'T SWEAT was still a cute, fun read. <br /> <br />Madeline doesn't know who her father is - which is why she's so reluctant to fly to Australia with her mom, where she will be meeting the guy that may become her stepfather in the near future. She claims that her mom is too flighty, crazy, and just plain weird to fly halfway around the world just to meet up with some guy she met in a chatroom. But Madeline goes with her mom anyway (as if she had a choice), and ends up spending Christmas in a country with no snow or Christmas carolers. <br /> <br />Madeline is terrified to find out that she won't get to do loads of shopping, lounging, and get pampered when she's staying down under. In fact, she ends up getting lost in the Outback and having to stay with a family of complete strangers...except for the fact that she's \\"in love\\" with the teenage boy Mitch... <br /> <br />PRINCESSES DON'T SWEAT was cute and funny, but it seemed to be lacking a little bit of that...oomph that made My Life As A Snow Bunny so special. I still enjoyed it and am looking forward to another book by Kaz Delaney. <br /> <br />Overall grade - B	2004-11-01

A few days ago, Katie's boyfriend of 4 1/2 years decided that he would rather be with a girl that wasn't afraid to do whatever he asked, like Katie was. In all her misery, Katie decides that she'll show Paul (her ex-boyfriend) that she doesn't need him, and The Plan is born. <br /> <br />In six weeks, Katie will go on 12 dates - one date every Friday and Saturday night. That way she'll be able to date a bunch of people, and she'll have time to fall in love again before prom!  <br /> <br />THE DATING DIARIES is cute, but the ending is predictable. I liked most of the characters (Frankie, Blue, and Matt probably being the most memorable), but the beginning was slow. It took about 30 pages to really get interested in the story. <br /> <br />Overall grade - B-	2004-10-24

Not only is it her birthday, but it's the night she finally plans to \\"seal the deal\\" with her boyfriend Nate - something she's been waiting to do for a while now. What she doesn't know, though, is that Nate isn't as crazy about her as he used to be. In fact, he's falling for someone new! <br /> <br />Serena and Co. (Nate, Dan, etc) go to Brown to do college interviews at the same time that Blair and her stepbrother Aaron are at Yale. The interviews don't go as planned, to say the least. <br /> <br />YOU KNOW YOU LOVE ME is yet another great book from the Gossip Girl series. It starts out a little slow (as did the first book), but it's totally worth it. A fun, scandalous read. Highly recommended. <br /> <br />Overall grade - A-	2004-10-17

It was better than I expected, but it's still just a fast paced \\"beach read.\\" <br /> <br />SPANISH HOLIDAY is about four friends taking a trip through Spain before they head off to college - you have Yaz, the gorgeous best friend; Laura, the main character that's looking for love; Ruth, the lovesick, wishy-washy one; and Tom, Ruth's boyfriend...he's hated by Yaz and Laura. Anyway, Tom's driving, so he gets to decide where to go. Laura and Yaz are less than pleased with this arrangement, but they don't see any way around it. Eventually, the girls get Tom to let them stay in a small Spanish town for a few weeks, where Yaz and Laura both meet (and fall for) Juan, the cute Spanish repairguy. Of course Laura and Yaz are fighting for his attention, and Tom and Ruth think they're ridiculous. But then everything changes... <br /> <br />SPANISH HOLIDAY isn't a great book - in fact, it's painfully predictable. Regardless, it's a cute story that helps to pass the time. It's definately not for anyone under fourteen, and to be completely honest, I thought there was a little too much talk about sex (no, don't worry, there aren't any hot and heavy scenes). Kate Cann seems to be getting better with every release, and I do recommend this for just fun, relaxing reading. <br /> <br />Overall grade - B	2004-10-06

Being a fan of the rest of the books in the series, I couldn't wait to read GIRLS UNDER PRESSURE. I knew this book would deal with Ellie's battle against her weight, but it was a bit of a letdown. <br /> <br />Ellie is upset that both her friends are gorgeous and thin, and she's on the shorter, stockier side. She also thinks she's ugly, and her way of dealing with this is simple - lose weight by dieting. Of course, the diet goes out of control and soon she's in a serious battle with anorexia. <br /> <br />My least favorite part of the book is the fact that nobody realized Ellie's problems sooner, and the fact that Ellie befriended an incredibly anorexic girl, without realizing that she was in the same condition. It's a good book, but GIRLS UNDER PRESSURE is probably the worst in the series. <br /> <br />Overall grade - C	2004-09-22

It interested me, so I thought I'd check out the book. Well. I finished it about twenty minutes ago, and I'm speechless. <br /> <br />MYSTERIOUS SKIN has so many different characters, memorable quotes, and mind-boggling descriptions that I couldn't put it down. I'm not going to go into the full story, but the book is fantastic. Basically, it's about two boys that share a common bond, though neither of them know it in the beginning of the story. As the book advances, both characters (Brian Lackey and Neil McCormack) start to come to terms with an event that took place during the summer of 1981.  <br /> <br />There are a few parts of the book that are extremely graphic, some pages were hard to read without putting the book down and trying to clear my mind. My short description does NOT do the book justice. <br /> <br />MYSTERIOUS SKIN is a fantastic novel, one that I wouldn't have chosen to read if I hadn't heard of the movie. This is definately the best book I've read in a loooong time. Highly recommended. <br /> <br />Overall grade - A+	2004-09-05

It's a fast-paced read, which is nice, but it's not as great as the original. <br /> <br />I don't want to go into much detail about the book, because I don't want to give anything away. Let's just say that the first book, The Gospel According to Larry, sounded like it could actually be based on a true story (as Tashjian writes it to be). However, VOTE FOR LARRY doesn't have that same feel. Right away you know that it is fiction (I must admit that I did spend a little while wondering if Larry was a real person after I read The Gospel...), and the political jargon gets a little annoying. <br /> <br />My favorite part of the book is the footnotes. They're almost always funny, sarcastic, etc.  <br /> <br />I recommend the book to fans of the original, because you find out what happens with Larry, Beth, and Peter. Fun, but nothing to serious. <br /> <br />Overall grade - C	2004-08-16

While it's not the best book I've ever read, it was better than I had expected. <br />  <br /> GOOD-BYE TO ALL THAT revolves around Solana, a beautiful teenage girl that likes a little more attention from boys than the rest of her friends. She's the only non-religious person in her group of friends, and she shares different views on a lot of issues - including premarital sex. They all think it's wrong, but Solana sees no problem with it.  <br />  <br /> Solana meets - and falls for - the newest employee at her uncle's ranch. She swears that he isn't like anyone that she's ever met, that he actually cares about her, etc. The Brios (Solana's group of friends) worry that Solana may be taking things a little too far a little too fast, but she doesn't care.  <br />  <br /> I can see how some people may find this book to be &quot;softcore porn for younger kids&quot; because it definately has its moments. GOOD-BYE TO ALL THAT is a good book, though. I wouldn't recommend it to younger kids, but for teenagers, I think it's a pretty good book. <br />  <br /> Overall grade - B-	2004-08-05

After she finished it, I borrowed it from her, because I thought it sounded incredibly interesting. <br />BLIND LOVE is the true story of David Graham and Diane Zamora, two intelligent teenagers, a serious couple, and...murderers, too. David and Diane had been dating for a while (and very seriously) and they were talking about getting married. One night David tells Diane that he has a confession to make: when they were going out he slept with another girl. Tenth-grader Adrianne Jones. Diane is devistated and tells him there's one way that he can make it up to her - kill Adrianne Jones. <br />David wants to prove his loyalty to Diane, so he agrees. Early December 1995, he and Diane go through with their plans...<br />BLIND LOVE is an incredibly engaging book, and I recommend it to anyone who likes to watch Law and Order or other court shows. It was written before the two were put on trial, so we don't really get the full story, but I still recommend it. There are 14 pictures in the book - pictures of all three teenagers, the crime scene, etc. - all of them help to give you an idea of what happened and how it destroyed the lives of everyone involved.<br />Overall grade - B+	2004-07-17

When he goes to tell her, she brushes him off, definately letting him know that she isn't interested in what he has to say.<br />After a while, Rae forgives Yana (she's still mad at Anthony, though) and they start to hang out. That's when Yana tells Rae something really important: Yana's dad is trying to get her put into the same institution that Rae was in after her \\"episode.\\" Even though Rae isn't very happy with Yana, she decides to help her. But when Rae and Yana run off to escape the doctors, they find themselves in a very dangerous situation.<br />REVELATIONS is definately my favorite book from the Fingerprints series. The best part?

I loved Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, and was at the bookstore the other day when I saw that there was a sequel. It's very good, almost better than the original.<br />MY PERFECT LIFE is told from Ella's viewpoint, not Lola's. It's really funny and all, but because Ella is not a drama queen and she's much more laid back than Lola. The book starts off with Lola announcing that she wants to run for student body president, and when Ella tells her that she can't run because she has only been at the high school for a year, Lola decides to nominate Ella instead. Sam Creek, the school's token bad boy/rebel, is running with Ella for vice president. Neither of them want to, but Lola nominated them and if they back out now they'll never live it down. Carla Santini is also running for president...and sure she'll win. Carla is Lola's arch nemisis - Lola will do anything to keep her from winning. <br />This book is really funny, with an unexpected twist of an ending. My only complaint with the book is: the first 20 or so pages are a little slow. In the long run, I highly recommend MY PERFECT LIFE for anyone looking for some funny, easy reading. (If you want to read this book, but haven't read Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, that's okay. It isn't really necessary. They make a few references to the book but you won't be lost without knowing what they're saying.)<br />Overall grade - B+	2004-03-28

A Candidate for Murder includes everything a good teen book needs - romance, humor, politics, and mystery. <br />The story starts off with Cary trying to escape from a friend at a party. He kept taking pictures of her, following her, etc. and she decided to go outside for a breath of fresh air. When she was out on the terrace, she heard something that she never expected. She heard voices - not just any voices, pretty creepy sounding voices. And she heard one of them say \\"...he's gone, up the creek...his nosiness...\\" She didn't think anything of it, but once the voices found out that she was listening to them, she gets in trouble. Cary feels that she's being watched/stalked, but nobody believes her, until some seriously scary stuff starts to happen.<br />This book is pretty good. I'm a huge fan of Joan Lowry Nixon, and this is a good book...but it's not her best. I recommend it to fans of her books, but not to people that want to get introduced to a new author (for you guys, I recommend her book 'Spirit Seeker').<br />Overall grade - B	2004-03-16

The three main characters (Sam, Nikki, and Alicia) all tell their stories, which each deal with a new, life-changing experiment they  decided to try.<br />Prom is coming up, and Nikki comes up with an idea - why not find a person that is socially 'below' her and her friends and invite him/her to the prom? Seems foolproof, right? Wrong. <br />Sam chooses Tia, this girl that most people are afraid of. She has a rough home life, a brother with Down syndrome, and a bad attitude. Sam doesn't give up though - he keeps following her around, talking to her, etc. He starts to build up a great friendship with Tia, and generally feels this project is doing him good.<br />Nikki decides to ask out the school's stereotypical nerd...Brian. He's a bit of a jerk, and treats her like she's the stupidest person on the planet. She keeps talking to him, and eventually, they also become friends.<br />Alicia chooses Morgan Weiss - the school's token 'bad boy.' Though Sam and Nikki don't approve of her choice, she goes along and tries anyway. What happens to her though, is a lot worse than she expected.<br />I highly recommed this book to everyone, because it's funny, sad, heartwarming, and easy to relate to...all in one book.	2004-03-11

After reading a few reviews on here, I was convinced - it sounded hilarious. It is funny, but I wasn't thrilled with it.<br />Emily Williams is furious with her mom and dad (who, they call Brother), they're making her move away from her home in Seattle to a small town in England. Though the move is only for a year, Emily is still furious, and things just keep getting worse. There's a ghost in her bedroom and he likes to play with her underwear, her sister drags her along to feminist gatherings, and she's held back a year in school. But then she meets Aidan and things start to look up...she really likes him, and he seems to like her just as much. Hanging out with Aidan has also helped her make some new friends (Devon, Fang, and Peg, to name a few) and she's starting to feel like she can survive the year-long trip. <br />This book is really funny, but I was disappointed in some of the things they talked about (Emily's parents semi-promoting sex, teen drinking, etc) I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone under 12. <br />Overall grade: B	2004-02-20

Having recently broken up with Tony, her first boyfriend, she's feeling pretty down. She doesn't think she'll ever meet another guy like him as long as she lives. But that all changes when she goes to this new-agey clinic with her dad and Izzie. She meets Daniel, and he's sweet, cute, and totally funny - they really hit it off, and soon start going out. Izzie and Nesta both dislike Daniel, but they don't want to hurt Lucy's feelings, but soon Daniel starts being a real jerk - not letting her hang out with her friends much, etc. <br />This is a good book, a bit better than Lucy's first story (MAtes, Dates, and Inflatible Bras). Highly recommended.	2003-12-24

And even though this story has been told a million times, \\"What Every...\\" definately one of the better versions.<br />Gabby has never really had a \\"best friend\\" - she isn't exactly a loner, but she can never find that special someone that she shares a bond with. Lynette, the slightly crazy outcast tells Gabby one day \\"She's new and she'll cry.\\" Gabby doesn't know what that means, but she soon finds out when Taylor comes into her 6th grade science class. Taylor and Gabby soon become great friends, spending the night at each others houses, going swimming together, and telling all their secrets. Except one. Gabby doesn't want to tell Taylor that it's her fault her mom died, or how she died. Taylor doesnt press, but she ceratinly wants to know. <br />This book is really good, but not anything new...the story's sweet and lighthearted. A short and easy read, I recommend it.	2003-12-13

But on time, when Jo makes a mistake on the slopes, she learns something about Hans. Hans isn't really from Scandanavia, and his real name is, in fact Frewin. He's from Austrailia, and trying to get a sponser for a pro ski turnament. Jo's a bit miffed at Frewin, but she still likes him the same. <br />The end of the book takes a different turn, it almost turns into a mystery.

Being a fan of Ms. Deaver's other books (Say Goodnight Gracie and Chicago Blues, to name a couple), I decided to check this one out too. I didn't put it down until I finished it, and loved the ending!!<br />Jamie is NOT a happy 17 year old girl. Her mom's making her move to Chicago for a summer and her best friend Webb is backpacking through Europe, so there's no way she can contact him. Just as Jamie thinks things can't get any worse - they do. She starts having these daydreams/fantasies that she can't control. And they keep landing her in potentially dangerous situations. Jamie meets Morgan Hackett and her aunt, a \\"shrink\\" (they were both in Say Goodnight Gracie). Jamie really likes the two, and becomes fast friends with Morgan. But when her dreams seem to take control over her, Morgan and Jamie's mom are forced to do something that Jamie might never forgive her for.<br />This book was awesome, and I totally loved the surprise ending.

Not only is she a natural beauty (IE she doesn't need to wear makeup, designer clothes, etc), but she has a black belt in any type of karate you can think of. She's also fearless. She was actually born without the fear gene, and can handle anything that comes her way. If she sees a girl getting mugged, she just runs into the fight and breaks it up, not thinking about how dangerous the situation is.

Through a school program she gets a pen pal - Christina. They soon become friends - they talk about everything.

Some topics covered are: How to aquire a boyfriend, how to dress like a princess, how to eat like a princess, and princess beauty tips. It's a funny book, but not long at all - it's about an hour read. Most of the comments in the book are written the funny - but stuffy - grandmere, and are snobby and useless.

It isn't as great as her other books, because of it's setting (1810, London) it lacks Meg's funny, pointed sarcasm.<br />Nicola Sparks is an orphan, but she thinks it's okay (because she never met her parents, she can't feel as bad about missing them, as she puts it). Her and her best friend Elenor both think Lord Sebastian \\"The God\\" is dashing, and Nicola gets to meet him during a stay at his familys house. Soon enough, Nicola and Sebastian are head over heels in love. But Nathaniel, Elenor's brother, feels that he's up to no good, and tells Nicola so. Even though she doesn't believe him, she checks things out for herself, and sure enough, he isn't who she thought he was.<br />This book's good, but I recommend The Princess Diaries or When Lightning Strikes more than this book.	2003-10-16

Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul is amazing, with inspiring stories about everything ~ friendship, love, parents, death/dying, sickness, and divorce (to name a few).

What he didn't know was that his beloved cat has cancer, and will need to be put down, or they can prolong her life with painful chemotherapy treatments. The way the author describes the pain the boy experiences is the best thing about the story, it brought me to tears. My very favorite in the book.<BR>-A Mason Dixon Memory: A story about racisim, overcoming it, and the bonds between friends.

As she sits in school and actually plans another life for herself, she knows it will never come true. But then, when her friends are all sitting around drinking milk from the school cafeteria, Janie can't believe her eyes. The picture of the missing child placed on the carton is herself. She remembers how she had her hair in pigtails, the dress she was wearing, everything. <br />Janie is taken on an emotional rollercoaster ride, not trusting her mom and dad anymore, not telling her best friend (oddly named Sarah-Charlotte), and at the same time fighting romantic feelings towards her friend - and neighbor - Reeve. Throughout the book Janie confronts her fears, aquires Reeve as more than a friend, and finds out what happened when she was three years old - and whisked away from her home and family, to a new, loving group of people.<br />This book is awesome, and I can't wait to read the next in the series, but this is definately not a book for kids under age 12.

Throughout the entire book I kept thinking \\"This is totally trying to be the next Princess Diaries.\\" Kate Brian knows how to write - she engages the reader with sarcasm and references to popular actors and movies - but she's telling a story that's been done so many times before, and always ends up the same.<br />Julia is sixteen years old, and she has no time to think about boys, movies, or fashion. That's because shes spending all her free time trying to earn money so she and her mom don't get evicted from their slightly grungy apartment. She's also trying to get a full ride to the college of her choice, which is by no means easy.<br />Meanwhile, Princess Carina from fictional Vineland is having problems WITH boys, fashion, and her family. Her father pays no attention to her, her mom wants her to go out with - and possibly marry - boring Markus, and she's also keeping a steady [but secret] online relationship with Ribbit, a little known rock star. But when Carina finds out that she's going to LA, she figures she can sneak away and meet Ribbit.<br />Of course, the plan doesn't work, because Froken Killroy, who watches over her, never lets her out of sight. Until one day when Carina meets up with Julia in a school bathroom, and they plan to switch lives - and Julia will get paid $10,000. That's money she NEEDS to pay the rent, so of course she agrees.<br />This book is really good, but of course it's totally, 100% sugarcoated and predictable. And totally unoriginal.

The reviews all focused on how funny the play was, and that's what really made me want to read it.<br />Up the Down Staircase is about a young schoolteacher that moves to a school in a rundown, slightly grungy area. She teaches English, and her class is terribly unruly. The students don't respect her, mouth off, and are always late for class. There's also an aspiring author that is teaching while wating to publish a book, and a crazy principal. The story has drama and it's funny moments, but it's pretty disappointing.<br />Up the Down Staircase wasn't funny at all - I didn't laugh once, or even crack a smile. In that sense, it was disappointing, but the storyline was so awesome that I will not soon forget the play. So, the play is recommended, but - and maybe it's just me! - it isn't funny like some of the reviews state. It's more of a drama.<br />Overall grade - B+	2003-09-13

After the wedding, the book bounces back and forth from the present summer, and Haven's \\"picture perfect\\" summer. That summer (hence the title) was amazing. Her mom and dad were still together, and the whole family - and Ashley's current boyfriend, Sumner, someone that everyone loved - packed up and stayed at Virginia Beach for a while. Haven loved Sumner, he treated her like a ral person, not just his girlfriends little sister. But, when Haven and her dad are eating dinner one night (present times again) - Sumner reappears in Haven's life. It seems like everywhere she goes, there Sumner is, working another odd job.<br />This book also deals with the fights that Ashley and Haven have (much like fights between any sisters), her mom's new friend Lydia...who is trying to change who her mom really is, and her best friend Casey, who  has totally changed since camp.<br />This book is great, and I'm glad I read it.

Well, it's definately different than any other book I've read, and not different in a bad way...but it's not that great either.<br />Dicey, James, Maybeth, and Sammy are all brother and sister, and one day their mom leaves them in a car in the parking lot of a mall in a small town. Dicey takes it upon herself to get the family to their destination - Aunt Cilla's house in Bridgeport. What Dicey and co. don't know is pretty bad: it's over a one-week walk to Aunt Cilla's.

Now it's Nesta's turn.<br />When Nesta is stuck on a three-hour train ride, she meets Simon, and they connect instantly. Simon invites Nesta to go horseback riding, skiing, and the movies, etc. But, on every \\"date\\" they go on, his sister Tanya and her friend Cressida tag along. Cressida has a BIG problem with Nesta, and is just downright mean to her. Meanwhile, Izzie's singing with a band, and Lucy's back with her old boyfriend Tony. <br />This book is funny, but not as good as the first two. And it really bothers me how Nesta talks - she always says how she's so pretty, and when you're pretty like she is boys always flock around you, etc. she sounds just like one of the stuck up girls that she complains about.<br />Overall grade - B	2003-08-13

Yes,a mediator - meaning she can talk to ghosts. Instead of spending summer vacation hanging out at the beach with her friends, she's working as a babysitter at a fancy hotel for some extra cash. Suze gets assigned to Jack, a lonely, boring, always-nervous eight year old. Jack NEVER wants to do anything but sit inside, and his older brother Paul is a total creep.<br />So, when Suze is off babysitting Jack, her stepfather (Andy) and stepbrother (Brad...aka Dopey) are digging a hole in the backyard to install a hot tub ~ but when Suze is woken up in the middle of the night by an angry ghost, warning her that if the digging doesn't stop there will be \\"hell to pay.\\" Then, after the message from the ghost, Suze's best friend (and longtime crush, Jesse)disappears. Suze is sure that the ghost has something to do with it, and retaliates, but also brings Jack and Paul into the problem.<br />This book is the best in the series...each one gets better, but this is the best!! We *finally* find out what happened to Jesse! <BR>I totally recommend this book!<br />Overall grade - A+	2003-08-12

I remember getting this for a birthday present on my fifth birthday, and absolutely loving it! Well, I found it in the basement the other day, and picked it up to see why I loved it so much.<br />\\"The Queen of Hearts\\" is basically about an unnamed little girl (referred to as The Little Girl), who promises her class her mother's wonderful tea hearts for the school party. But, the day before the party, her mom has to go away on a business trip, so the little girl and her father decide to make the cookies instead. Of course, the cookies turn out to be a big hit, and everyone loves them, but this is just such a nice story - you can't help but love it! The (what I believe to be) watercolor pictures aren't amazing, but fit the book very nicely - and I still have the heart-shaped necklace that came with the book!<br />Overall grade: A	2003-08-05

Well, I got it today - and already finished it - but thought it was pretty good. The only complaint I have is the length of the book - 64 pages is wayyyyyy too short!<br />Mia is back, and sassier than ever! This book takes place over spring break, and Mia and her G&T class are going to West Virginia to build houses for the less fortunate. Mia is mostly looking forward to it because it means five days with Michael, her boyfriend, without her parents around.<br />But, the trip isnt as great as they thought it would be - first of all, Boris gets sick on the bus, so for the seven hour ride, he's throwing up. Then, the giant bugs eat everyone alive, the tents leak, and Mia and Michael can't get a second to be alone. But, as everything starts to look up, a surprise visitor ruins the moment.<br />This book's really funny, and I enjoyed it a lot, but it's just too short to really explain a lot.<br />Overall grade: A-	2003-08-03

This book, instead of focusing on Lucy, focuses on her best friend Izzie.<br />The book starts off with Izzie taking a chance and being a little wilder than usual - she dyes her hair green to match the bridesmade dress she has to wear for her stepsister's wedding. Right from the first few pages, the book takes off - Izzie is full of energy and life, though she does worry too much about boys.<br />Izzie meets Mark one day when she's out shopping with her friends Nesta and Lucy, and swears that she's in love. Mark asks for her phone number, and Izzie (very happily) gives it to him. He told her that he'd call soon, but never does. <br />Izzie sort of chases him for the entire book, but in the end, will they get together, or will she decide that he's not worth worrying over?<br />I loved this book, it was hilarious and I love the way they talk! Also, there are a lot of Friends references, which were pretty cool - being a fan of the show, I picked up on the not too easy to find ones. This book is great, very similar to Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging. Highly recommended!<br />Overall grade: A+	2003-08-02

I started reading it at around midnight, and didn't put it down until I finished it (around 4 AM) - it's that good!<br />In Letters to Julia, Liz Beech is a fifteen year old aspiring author. Her English teacher gives her the address of a publisher, because Liz has so much talent. Liz reluctantly sends chapter by chapter of the novel she's writing to Julia Jones, an editor at a big New York publishing company. Julia keeps telling Liz that she has an amazing talent, and that she has \\"poetic sensiblity.\\"<br />Pretty soon Liz and Julia form an amazing friendship and write to each other about everything - problems with parents, school (well, for Liz anyway), and work. Julia keeps reassuring Liz that her work is amazing, and that she'll try to publish the novel when it's finished. But, one day Liz says something that she instantly regrets - Julia stops writing to her.<br />Will Liz and Julia be able to re-establish their relationship, or is it a lost cause?<br />This book is truly amazing,  and it's a shame that it's out of print. If you can find this at a library, garage sale, used book store, etc. pick it up! It's great!<br />Overall grade: A+	2003-07-31

I *loved* the book Holes, I've read it over ten times, so I was a little unsure if  this would be as good. Stanley  Yelnats Survival Guide to Camp Green Lake is hilarious, just as good as the original, Holes.<br />This book is written \\"by\\" Stanley Yelnats, so it's really funny to read about what he thinks. He uses sarcasam to tell you what went on after he left, everything about how each camper (in his tent) got there, how to avoid the wildlife, and what not to say to the campers.  There are also quizzes, which are hilarious, but the highlight of the book is definately the appendix-type thing in the back, which explains why each camper was there, and they're laugh-out loud funny.<br />I recommend this book if you liked the book or movie Holes, you won't be disappointed, the only thing is, dont read it in public, because you will laugh out loud!<br />Overall grade: A+	2003-07-15

Martin, is a story of love, friendship, and family. <br />Hattie Owen, an almost 12-year old, does not have a normal life: she lives in the boardinghouse her parents run, with eccentric boarders such as Angel Valentine (the beautiful young woman who works at the bank), Miss Haggerty (the grandmotherly figure), and Mr. Penny (the older man with tons of clocks). Also, her grandparents look down on the family, because her parents \\"don't have real jobs.\\" When you think the situation can't get any weirder - it does.<br />Hattie's parents sit her down one night to tell her a shocking secret: she has a 21 year old uncle named Adam. Why didn't anyone tell her about Adam? Simple, he's been living in a boarding school-type institution his whole life, due to his mental illness. <br />Soon Hattie gets to meet Adam, and she gets along with him very well. She hangs out with him all the time, they go for walks, to the carnival, and just around town. <br />Hattie has never made friends easily, but at the carnival, she meets Lelia, the carnival owner's daughter, and forms a great friendship. Adam and Lelia both make Hattie grow and change her life forever, but when something happens one day, will Hattie and her family/friends be able to cope?<br />A Corner of the Universe is a fast and easy read, but it's really predictable, and the end isn't satisfying at all. <br />Overall grade: C	2003-07-10

I love Lurlene McDaniel's books, I've read almost all of them, and I was definately not upset with the book \\"A Rose for Melinda.\\" It's a very good story, very touching, and very sad. I really like the format it's written in - all letters, journals, and memos.<br />A Rose for Melinda starts off with Jesse Rose and Melinda Skye in first grade. Jesse and Melinda have a great friendship, and always look out for each other. The friendship stays strong and great throughout 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. grades. Jesse moves away when his parents get divorced, but Melinda and Jesse are still best friends.<br />Then, when Melinda is living her dream (taking professional dance classes in Washington D.c.), she faints. So, Melinda goes to the hospital, has some tests, etc. But, when the test results come back, the Skye family is shocked: Melinda has lukemia.<br />Melinda's friends Bailey and Jesse are there for her all the way, and both Bailey and Jesse become friends too (with each other). In the end, will Melinda survive? Or will she need a bone marrow transplant? And if she does get a bone marrow transplant...will her body reject the marrow?<br />This story is really good, but it's a lot like a Lifetime movie. I reccommend it, but this is one of McDaniel's flakiest books. Hopefully, her next one will be better.<br />Overall grade: A-	2003-06-16

It is one of the best books I have ever read!<br />Mandy and Tracey form a strange friendship ~ they've never actually met, they just write letters back and forth (pen-pals, I guess you could call it...though in the book Mandy clearly states she hates that phrase). Mandy tells Tracey all about her family, her friends, and her boyfriends. Tracey writes all about her rich family, her horses, her glorious vacations, etc. But - one of the girls isn't telling the truth. When Mandy and Tracey start getting into more serious, darker discussions, the book really, really gets interesting.<br />One day, the letters from one of the girls (I won't say which one) stop, and are sent back to the other girl, marked \\"Return to Sender.\\" What happens to Tracey and Mandy's friendship?<br />I love this book, I've read it twice since I got it and its just amazing!

I was pretty excited to read this one though ~ the plot seemed to be more about Elizabeth and her problems than about boys. Yeah, it *is* about Elizabeth, but, it's also about boys (and those parts got real annoying - real fast).<br />After Elizabeth catches her twin sister Jessica and her boyfriend Sam kissing one night, she bolts with the Jeep. SHe has no idea where she's going, she just knows she has to get away from Jessica and Sam. Elizabeth ends up at a diner in Springfield, Illinois...where she meets Daphne, and forms a great friendship.<br />After serious consideration, Elizabeth decides to go to University of London (she got a full-ride to study there for a semseter), but when she gets there - nothing goes right. <br />Yeah, this book was actually good, better than the SVU books, but not the best. It became really predictable by the end, because Elizabeth keeps getting into problem after problem. It is good escapist reading though.<br />Overall grade - B	2003-06-14

Melanie is extremely excited to be an older sister, and has already finished painting the nursery and buying Christmas presents for the baby. Five days before Christmas, her mom goes into labor - and Jessica is born. But there's one problem, Jessica has a terminal illness that can't be fixed...she will die within a few days. Even though Jessica is only in the family's lives for a few days, she changes each of them forever.<BR>This story made me cry, it's a great one!<br />\\"Last Dance\\" is my favorite of the 3 stories. Brenda gets a phone call from a Mrs. Drake, and she's asking her to go out with her son, Doug. Doug has cancer, and his wish is to go out with Brenda, because, according to him \\"She's the most beautiful girl in the world.\\" Brenda really begins to fall for Doug, but, will it all work out in the end?<br />\\"Kathy's Life\\" is the last story in the book, and my least favorite. Ellie has it all: the boyfriend, the popularity, and...oh yeah, the divorced parents. But when Ellie and Kathy are assigned to do an English project together, they both change, for better. Kathy is the live in nanny for a young couple's son, Christian. When Ellie and Kathy begin to talk, Ellie finds out a big secret, about why Kathy is the way she is.<br />All the stories in this book are good, but Ellie's (Kathy's Life) story is pretty racy at first...it's pretty different than any other Lurlene McDaniel book in that sense. <br />Overall grade: A-	2003-05-31

When she goes to tell him the message, she finds him totally strange - he keeps looking at her neck, doesn't like sunlight, and has no red hair...so why is he called Red? <br />When Suze tells Father Dom all about this, he comes to the stratling conclusion that Red Beaumont is a vampire. Suze doesn't believe in vampires, but is a little afraid of Red. She goes back there, and ultimately gets into much deeper trouble than she could ever have imagined.<br />Will Suze get into more trouble than she can handle with the possible vampire?<br />This book's really good, I'd say better than the first...from the first line (which I believe is \\"Nobody told me about the poison oak\\") to the last, this book is absolutely hilarious.

Cat's mom may be overprotective, but soon we learn about her father ~ who is overly friendly towards Cat. Of course, we all know what happens next, not right away, but what's going to happen. Cat tells how her mom would punish her if she mentioned anything about her body, and her dad would go out of his way to &quot;comfort her&quot; - he even buys her racy clothes and makeup (two things strictly forbidden by her mom). <br />I liked the first two books in the Wildflowers series, but the third one (Jade) really disappointed and disturbed me. Cat isn't as bad as Jade, but not as good as Misty (the first book). I don't reccommend these book though, because they are **REALLY** disturbing. If you don't mind books that are &quot;darker&quot; - then you'll like these. But if you like happy, romance books ~ stay away from VC Andrews.	2003-05-25

This book was good for the last twenty-ish pages. The first hundered or so were very slow and boring, then it was interesting...then it was so utterly disturbing I had to stop reading it. It took me about two weeks to finish, because I really didn't want to read it because it's such a sick and disturbing story. I expect more from &quot;Cat&quot; the next in the series.	2003-05-23

I was really excited to read Star, because she's my favorite of the four girls...and I was kind of disappointed. &quot;Star&quot; is really really good, but the first thirty five pages are kind of slow. It starts with Star being dropped off at Dr. Marlowe's office, today being her day to tell the other three girls (Cat, Jade, and Misty) her story. She starts with telling them how her mom's an alcoholic, and her dad left them when her and her brother (Rodney) were just little kids. Her mom soon meets someone, and they come home totally trashed, night after night, for quite some times. When this is happening, Star's little brother is getting hurt at home, and Star is having problems at school. Her grades are slipping. After a while, Star's mom dumps her and Rodney off to live with her grandma. When Star starts school, she meets Steve, and they quickly become boyfriend and girlfriend. Steve has the same problem as Star - his dad drinks and his mom is dead. But one night something horrible happens, and Star is changed forever. <br />This book is REALLY good, but the beginning is kind of slow, which is the only reason it's not getting 5 stars.

My friend told me it was really good, and I had to read it - and she was right! Some people have mentioned that V.C. Andrews must be targeting a younger audience with the Wildflowers Miniseries, but I disagree. In &quot;Misty&quot; a young teenage girl (Misty) goes to her counsuler and meets three girls that have similar problems to her's (the three girls are named Cat, Jade, and Star). Misty tells her story to the girls, and after her sad story, they all feel closer together. Misty's parents are divorced because her dad found a younger woman (who's almost the same age as Misty!) and her mom is image obsessed. After the divorce, Misty's grades go down, her friends drift away from her, and she finds herself in 2 bad relationships, both which end abruptly. This book is very good,but very short, and also very suggestive. I reccommed it to anyone who likes V.C Andrews books or anyone that likes books about divorce or romance.	2003-05-10

Besides working all summer, she's also taking a French class to be closer to Steve, the guy she likes. In her French class, she keeps getting substitutes that don't speak a word of French, and the real teacher is M.I.A. In her French class she meets Charlotte, who teaches her a lot about being different. <br />Fleming's mom is pregnant with the fifth kid, and she has to attend Lamaze class with her mom. As if that wasn't weird enough, her dad's an ice skater, and is planning on skating at the popular rodeo in town every summer. <br />Though Fleming is trying to impress Steve, she meets - and falls - for someone else...his best friend.<br />This books is really funny, but I was disappointed to see it had a similar plot line to \\"Truth or Dairy\\"	2003-05-10

I love the Foxtrot books, and this one is just as good as the rest!<br />Highlights of the book are:<BR>-&quot;When Harry met Gandalf&quot; (Harry Potter vs. Lord of the Rings)<BR>-&quot;Paige Goes Rudolph&quot; (Paige's acne problems)<BR>-All the comic strips with Paige and Peter in school<BR>-The segments with Jason and Peter in the pizza place<br />This book is great, but if you have the 2003 tear-away calendar, there are about five of the same comics in here (that are also on the calendar).	2003-05-04
US	33365619	R1BC7EC2BHGBSC	0064405176	48976284	Walk Two Moons	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Amazing	In Sharon Creech's \\"Walk Two Moons\\", the main character Salamanca Hiddle is truly unique. She travels across the country with her grandparents, to visit the Badlands, an Indian reserve, and even find out where her mother is. Salamanca tells her ornery grandparents stories of moving away from the family farm in Kentucky, her dad's new friend (who is a girl), school, and her weird neighbors, and her friend who supposedly has the \\"perfect\\" family. Along the way, Salamanca (Sal) faces many challenges, and finds out where her mother is. The ending to this book is great, and you truly love every character that there is.	2003-05-04
US	33365619	RAP592BHW622N	0020415133	941706786	Wolf Rider	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Very very good	When Andy gets a phone call one night, his whole world changes. The voice on the other line admits \\"I just killed someone...\\" and begins to tell Andy everything. What the girl looked like, her name, why he killed her, etc. Andy keeps talking to \\"Zeke\\"  (that's what the caller called himself), as his friend calls the cops from a payphone and tells the story. The cops don't believe Andy, Andy's father doesn't believe him, and soon his friend doesn't even believe him. Andy keeps talking to Zeke, but suddenly he realizes his life is in danger. <br />Wolf Rider is a great book, and I reccommend it to everyone. It is predictable, but still really good!	2003-05-01

This one's my favorite, because the characters are all so fun. It really made me cry though, because I loved all the characters, and at the end, when one of the (I don't wanna ruin it) died, I cried - which I never do in books. Basically, Dawn Rochelle goes to a camp for kids with cancer, as a counsuler this year though, and meets a bunch of great kids with cancer. One kid in particular (I believe her name is Marley, but I haven't read the book in a while, so if I'm wrong, I'm sorry) has a major attitude problem, and Dawn cannot stand her. Finally, after trying to get along with her, Dawn finds out why. This books is great, is all I can say! You have to read it if you like Lurlene McDaniel!	2003-04-30

All American Girl is just as good - if not better - as the Princess Diaries books. The main character, Samantha, stops an assanation plot - of the president of the United States. Now, Samantha is on the news, in the newspaper, and even invited to the White House! Samantha becomes good friends with the President's son...but it becomes a little more than a friendship quickly. *If you liked the Princess Diaries, you'll like this, and it isn't as nasty, as in dirty*	2003-04-30

No, it's not a bad book, but, it's not great. The main character - Rebecca - is amazingly self-centered and concieted. Basically, in \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" Rebecca Bloomwood has a problem. She shops all the time, and charges everything, but can't pay the bills, with the cruddy job she has. When Becky tries to quit, things get even worse ~ she can't stop buying things. Finally, the bank keeps calling, and she moves in with her parents. This book is funny, but the only reason it got 4 stars is because Becky's too self-centered. I really liked it, but some of the British lingo was confusing (Ex: in London, \\"pissed\\" means drunk). This is overall a good - and funny - book.	2003-04-30
US	33365619	RCWZHJ2KUIH9C	0142300993	460514891	Exposed (Sevens, Week 2)	Books	5	1	2	N	N	The best in the series	I read Week 2: Exposed in a little less than 3 hours, and was very happy. This one still follows the stories of seven teens with seven different problems, but this one mainly focuses on Jeremy. His new lifestyle shocks and disturbs his parents, and he moves in with a friend when his parents fight with him about his new choice. This is definately the best in the series, because Jeremy's problem is realistic - more realistic than most the other problems in these books. These aren't really that great of books, but this is the best. If you didn't like the first one, I highly reccommend this one. It's MUCH better!	2003-04-27
US	33365619	R1V05QJQ3GEB1J	1550376640	565767012	Leslie's Journal (Doghouse Books)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Very interesting	\\"Leslie's Journal\\" is the typical story of a teenage girl whose boyfriend abuses her. Though the story has been told so many times before, this one is especially good. Leslie has to write a journal for her English class, and after a short time, she starts to tell secrets she'd never tell anyone. Secrets about her best friend, her mom, her teachers, and her boyfriend. Until her English teacher reads it, and reports it to the principal, because Leslie has written about her abusive boyfriend. Her boyfriend gets called down to the office and questioned, and later comes after Leslie. It's a very good book, but it is haunting. I strongly reccommend it.	2003-04-27

Even though it's funny, it was disappointing. Because she's over in the palace, a lot of the fun characters are missing - mainly Lana, Lilly, her mom, Mr. G., and Michael. Yeah, she talks to everyone but Lana, but it's not as funny as when she has face-to-face conversations with them. The one thing I've noticed other people saying is that Mia has become superficial and shallow. She really has, throughout the entire book she keeps talking about how much she loves Michael, even more than family. And the fact that she stole for him also bothered me. The funniest thing in the book is the ongoing talk of parking meters. Overall, this book is good, but not as good as most of Meggin Cabot's books.	2003-04-27

Being the first of the seven books in the Sevens series, I felt that in the beginning you are dropped into a scene you wouldn't understand. After the first 3 chapters, it begins to make sense. These books follow seven teens through the problems they're having (and all of them are far-fetched, and don't seem likely to happen to seven people who used to be freinds) and each chapter bounces back and forth between the seven, but this book mainly focuses on Meena. Meena is babysitting one night when she is physically - and mentally - assulated by the father of the child. Because of that, she falls into depression, drops the swim team, and her grades plummet. This book is OK, but not very realistic, and for the book to make complete sense, you have to read the other six books, which are mediocre too.	2003-04-27

I had to read this book for my English class, but I didn't want to in the beginning. It didn't sound very good from the description. I couldn't have been more wrong! I read it in less than a day, and have read it about 3 times since then. It's soooooo good!!!! The only thing I didn't like was the end, because you want to know what happens. I SOOOOO reccommend Parvana's Journey, which is the sequel. It's better than this!	2003-04-27
US	33365619	R1BP1XNBL5LDHI	0553567608	816035430	Six Months to Live	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Predictable, but still good	I loved \\"Six Months to Live\\" because it's a very well written, sad book for teens. In the book Dawn Rochelle (13) is diagnosed with lukemia. She endures chemotherapy with a 13 year old girl (Sandy) that rooms with her in the hospital. When they are both in remission, they go to a camp for kids suffering cancer, and meet even more friends that have cancer. After camp, one of the friends relapses. \\"Six Months to Live\\" is a very sad book, most definately the best Lurlene McDaniel book.	2003-04-27
US	33365619	R8DDQAYJ4AVHD	0698118286	457875092	Rules of the Road	Books	5	0	0	N	N	The best	I had to read Rules of the Road for a competition (yes,a book competition) for my English class. I didn't like the beginning because it focuses on how Jenna loves working at a shoe store/selling shoes. When Mrs. Gladstone, the owner of the shoe stores, makes Jenna her driver, the book starts to get better. Jenna is driving from Chicago to Texas, with an ornery elderly lady in the back seat. Jenna and Mrs. Gladstone form a wonderful friendship, also making new friends in the shoe business on the trip. Jenna really grows as a person, and you will fall in love with all the likeable characters in the book. You will hate the rival shoe stores, and even cry at the end. This book it great with it's amazing imagery and phrases. Joan Bauer is an amazing author!	2003-04-27

It's just an all around great story! It has it's funny moments, its sad moments (you *will* cry!), and its moments when you think its totally weird. You get swept up into the book, and it seems as though you know the characters! Joan Bauer is a great author! Rules of the Road and Thownk! are both really good too!	2003-04-27

Last fall she told me to read this one, because it was her favorite, and very sad. I picked it up, and finished it in a few hours. My favorite story is Night Vision (as a few other people have said) because it's just soooo sad! Each story is predictable, but still very  good and heartwarming. This is definately my favorite book by her, because the stories are short but you still seem to fall in love with the characters. That doesn't happen much, but when it does, you know the book's great.	2003-04-26
US	33365619	R1RNA4290OUW9J	0385729340	122662979	The Second Summer of the Sisterhood (Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, Book 2)	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Very good...	I loved the first book \\"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\" and this one is nearly as good, if not better. It starts out as summer, a year after the girls found out about the pants. Everyone but Tibby, who is going off to a film class, is staying home. Until Bee decides to go on a trip to visit her grandmother. This starts the hilarious story with a new twist. This book made me laugh out loud, but it also made me cry. Parts of it made me really mad, because of the sheer stupidity of the girls or their friends. This book is really really good, but the one complaint I have is the fact that Carmen is a brat throughout the entire book, until the last few chapters. She was my favorite character in the first book, but in this one I found her unlikeable. All in all a very good book though.	2003-04-26
