Some are great, others not, but they are always at least enjoyable. The man writes with so much assurance and charm that people who like deep and well-written thrillers have to love and thank him for such a great material.<br /><br />`The Constant Gardener' is a really interesting book. It has an engaging beginning that will be solved throughout the novel. Tessa Quayle is brutally murdered in a distant region in Kenya-- where the couple lives. Before her death, she and her husband --the gardener in the title-- had felt apart. Ever since they moved to Africa, she involved with humanitarian works, while he focused in his office duties. The crime will shad a new light in her life, and Quayle will learn that Tessa is far from being what he thought she was.<br /><br />In a nutshell the novel is Quayle's quest trying to find out who killed his wife and why. The deeper he goes, the more dirty he finds. He learns that her death may be linked to the pharmaceutical industry and its market in the third world.<br /><br />Le Carr&eacute; has his special gift for drawing believable plots with by characters that are very human. Quayle and Tessa are people that may be anyone's friends. The dynamics of their falling apart is very true to earth. But not only them are believable, but also the supporting characters.<br /><br />The narrative is in a worthwhile slow motion --in other words, it requires patience from the readers. But people who enjoy Le Carr&eacute;'s style will find it fascinating the way he unfolds the story until it ending. At the same time, the writer is able to touch upon serious issues like the capitalism and the pharmaceutical industry that causes at lot of harm to many countries --mostly in the third world.<br /><br />All in all, `The Constant Gardener' is quite a decent read, but it requires a lot of concentration from the reader. It is different from the fast pace explosive thrillers that are out there, but it is still very good on its own merits.l very good on its own merits. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

Evelyn Waugh is one of those few talented people who can make an unforgettable impression with their very first work, \\"Decline and Fall\\". Book after book, he proved that this one was not a fluke and all the talent he promised here was confirmed later on.<br /><br />As he tells halfway through the narrative, `the whole of this book is really an account of the mysterious disappearance of Paul Pennyfeather', and its pages tells us who is and what happened to the character. He is a strange man from the beginning when he is kicked out of college because of indecent exposure -not his fault, actually - and ends up forced to work as a schoolmaster.<br /><br />In his new position Pennyfeather will meet many interesting characters that eventually will lead to his fall. These people - mostly Margot and her son Peter - will change his life, mostly for worse, until he disappears - but there is more in Waugh witty narrative.<br /><br />With his main character, the writer depicted those kind of people who never acts, only reacts and therefore goes through the motions of life. Pennyfeather always seems to have a supporting role in his own life, and all the events that affects him take places much without his involvement.<br /><br />Waugh's talent resides, among other places, in his ability to make ordinary situations become funny with his clever approach. For most of the time we don't laugh out loud, just smile, but when the laughs come they are unstoppable. With this device, the writer is making an acid critic of his society. Many contemporary writers who are desperate to make important and strong comments about our contemporary world should read Waugh and learn something from the master.	2005-09-23

Not only did this book give him a Pulitzer Prize, but it also cinched the Nobel Prize for him, awarded in 1954. Nevertheless, critics and scholars aren't unanimous to believe that this is best work. For many, in this book, Hemingway abandoned his realistic approach.<br /><br />For many people this is an allegory of the writer's condition when he wrote the novella. Hemingway himself would be the `old man' being attacked by critics on a feeding frenzy. However much some people do believe in this interpretation - and they say that Hemingway's writing were based on his life experience, so why wouldn't this be? - this would be a very small interpretation.<br /><br />In \\"The Old Man and the See\\", Hemingway found a middle shape that fits between his long novels and his short stories. In this novella, the writer takes his famous style to another level since he retains so much from his prose. Everything we know about his writing is there: the short and direct sentences are the best example. But in this novel the sentences aren't the only device that is short.<br /><br />The novella `lacks' characters - actually, there are only two major characters and one of them is off the stage for most of the time. This is the `old man''s show. As character he is fully developed however we don't learn much about his past, but it doesn't take too much from Hemingway to tell us who somebody is - just some tips and we know.<br /><br />The narrative is short and concentrates on a couple of days in the old man's life. The most dramatic moments -near the end - unfold beautifully. Throughout the book, Hemingway deals with someone struggling against defeat. The main character, Santiago, has gone eighty-four days without catching a fish. But he refuses to accept defeat: the old man sails out beyond the other fishermen in search for the biggest fish.<br /><br />\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a short book that doesn't take to much time to be read. On the other hand, it may stay with reader long after finishing. With his power of persuasion, Hemingway has created an unforgettable tale of love for life and honor.sn't take to much time to be read.

His body of work is not very long, but impressive. He has created characters that are already inside people's mind, like Rob Fleming, from \\"High Fidelity\\", and Will Lightman, from \\"About a Boy\\". As a matter of fact, there are many others in each book. It seems that this writer has a magic touch to make unforgettable virtually every character he creates.<br /><br />In his look at the contemporary marriages and charity \\"How to be good\\" there are, at least, three: the narrator Katie Carr, her hubby and the faith healer Dr GoodNews. The narrative is told by the girl, whose marriage is just falling apart, since her husband is such of the bully on the block. But things are to change when he meets Dr GoodNews, someone who wants to change the world, who seems to have traveled from a time machine straight from the sixties.<br /><br />The faith healer changes David so drastically that Katie's husband starts to give away money and their kids' toys to poor people. Later on he wants every neighbor to adopt an abandoned 20-something. At this point, Katie, who is a GP, starts to wonder what mean good really is, what takes from a person to be considered not bad. Her marital doubts are skyrocketed by her husband's new behavior.<br /><br /> In \\"How to be Good\\" Hornby has a chance to examine not only the failure of the contemporary marriage, and also the failure of the family as an institution. It is like the ideal from the 60s transported to the XXI Century liberalism, and what went right and what went wrong.<br /><br />Of course, it is still a light read most of it, but don't let the light tone fool you. The writer is dealing with serious issues and asking the reader what it is to be a good person nowadays. Laughs abound as in any Hornby's book. And although many doesn't consider this one of his best novels, every reader must admit that this is his finest. Here the writer seems to have found the perfect balance between the critic of the current moral and funny moments. He is a more mature writer, in whose prose the funny moments come naturally and, therefore, they are genuinely funny.o have found the perfect balance between the critic of the current moral and funny moments.

A narrative packed with meditation on life, eternity and history -- but, mind you, she is not Bran Stocker and her version of Dracula is a pale version of what the myth could have been. Besides the unnecessary length, the main problem with the book is the absence of an original voice -- or, should say, voices.<br /><br />The narrative of \\"The Historian\\" unfolds liked Russian dolls, with one narrator invading another's narrative. The book is the story told by a woman, remembering events when she was in her teens. Inside her narrative is her father's narrative; inside his are another people's letters and accounts. Confusing? This word doesn't even palely describes the level of mess in this book.<br /><br />Not only has Mrs Kostova created gazillion narrators, but also strangely all of them have the same voice. There isn't a distinction of voices: everybody -- no matter where in the world, or in which period of the history -- uses the same choice of vocabulary and grammar structures, eve if there are century between them.<br /><br />Every time a narrator says \\"I\\", the readers starts wonder to whom this pronoun refers. To use such a device, one must be a very talented and creative writers -- which is clearly not the case here. Her characters are boring to death -- or living dead, since this is vampire book. It is hard to find sympathy to her so-smart creations, who are so brilliantly naïve in a good American way.<br /><br />Her characters seem to have the most brilliant memory. They can perfectly recall even and even dialogues (told in direct speech) almost twenty years later, and they are used to write letters that they already know won't be sent. Honestly she should have found a better device to put this story forward.<br /><br />Something that bothers any attentive reader is how unusually Paul, supposedly a brilliant scholar, is always very surprised when a foreigner speaks with him in a perfect English. And then the writer finds the `perfect' excuse, the speaker study in England. If she used such a device once, that would be fine, but like five times, it is too much. People can speak English even without having gone abroad, Mrs Kostova.<br /><br />It is also clear that the novel lacks some editing. There is no reason that such story takes almost 700 pages to be told. Any good and competent writer -- with the help of his/her editor-- would cut it short to the regular 500, at most. Most of the events are redundant, we have the feeling that something happens too many times, and it doesn't change or add anything to the story -- not even create mood or atmosphere, which are, clearly, things missing in the book most of the time.<br /><br />In the current fever of pseudo-historic books, such as \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"The Rule of Four\\", \\"The Historian\\" stands as a little better than the usual crap. But who really wants to read a great book about Dracula must stick to the original, namely Bran Stoker's. There you can find fear, desire, beauty and a hell of a story.

And he did write this story -- and it is the last one in his book called \\"The Periodic Table\\". It is curious to notice that both stories \\"Carbon\\" and \\"Gold\\" are the most important ones in this book.<br /><br />\\"Gold\\", placed about in the middle of the book, is the one in which an expected tragedy happens. But this is expected only by the readers -- who know about Levi's life and what happened to him. Part autobiography, part literary fantasy and part a gritty drama, the collection \\"The Periodic Table\\" is a book we read with a heavy heart, because we readers are expecting for something that will cut short the innocence of the early texts.<br /><br />It is not, by any means, an easy and light reading. On the contrary, it requires a patient and interested reader to go through all these stories. Most of them are sad, and it is totally understandable. Levi's choice of words and narrative progress is peculiar and require readers to pay close attention to understand and absorb what he means.<br /><br />\\"The Periodic Table\\" is a book that requires multiple readings. As the reader grows older, he/she will certainly have a different approach to the stories and Levis's worldview. He had a very interesting life that is very worthy telling -- probably that's one of the reason why he wrote some autobiographical books.<br /><br />The people he meets throughout the book are genuine human beings and very touching in their fears and joys. Probably the most unforgettable `character' is Mr M&uuml;ller in a story called \\"Vanadium\\". This is one of the proofs that the world turns and we will always meet again ghosts from the past.<br /><br />\\"The Periodic Table\\" is a book from the past that aims the present and reaches the future.

US	49577356	RAL0UFWUQ79HC	0375724834	352044771	Motherless Brooklyn	Books	5	4	5	N	N	`Motherless' book from an imaginative and confident writer	It takes some time and energy to get started with Jonathan Lethem's \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\". It is not an easy book -- at least in the first few pages. Once the reader gets the hang of it, the reading becomes less complicated -- but never really easy. This is one of the best pleasures this detective novel can give to an avid reader.<br /><br />Not only is \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" a mind bending work with its twist and language, but it is also a genre bending narrative. Think of the classic noir narrative done in first person -- add to it a late Twentieth Century pop culture and the Tourette's Syndrome tics and you may have a slight idea of what the book is about. From all of it, what surfaces is Lethem's sensibility to build a main character, namely Lionel Essrog, who is not only believable but also sympathetic.<br /><br />He is the narrator and belongs to a group of detectives known as Minna Men, former orphans, which were taken under Frank Minna's wings.  But early in the novel, their protector is brutally murdered and in a course of a couple of days, Lionel will try to find the killer.<br /><br />As all good detective novels, \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" is a roller coaster of twists and unpredictability. Near the end readers may start trying to recap with the is-this-really-it feeling. This is not a flaw in the book, but another hook. As is common in the genre both narrator and reader are deceived. The former may not like it, but readers certainly find more pleasure when they cannot guess what is going to happen. And this novel has plenty of surprises.<br /><br />With a less brilliant writer, \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" would have been an unreadable mess. Lionel's tics would have been pathetic and unreal -- but Lethem seems to love his creation and that gives the character human dimensions that are very beautiful and appreciated throughout the reading. This is one of those books that remind us that living is not easy.	2005-08-28

The right sentence, as we all know, is that every action produces a reaction -- but nearly the end of his life, Murray is certain that the so called reaction means losing something. However not Roth doesn't use the whole book to prove it, he certainly agrees with his character.<br /><br />The narrative that goes back and forth in time depicts the life of Ira Ringold (Murray's brother), a very famous radio star who marries a very famous Hollywood's silent movies star named Eve Frame. It turns out that the \\"I\\" in the title of the book is Eve. But it is not out of the sheer patriotism that she declares her husband is a communist. Their story is told by Murray to Nathan Zuckerman, a sort of Roth's alter ego that has been in many of his books.<br /><br />Alongside with \\"American Pastoral\\" and \\"The Human Stain\\", the novel is part of a trilogy written by Roth depicting life in North America in the XX Century. But different from the other two books, in \\"I Married A Communist\\", Zuckerman is much more active. This time round he used to be friend with the main character in the time when the events happened. Therefore, more than being only a listener or a narrator, the he is a character of Ira's story -- as told also by Murray.<br /><br />When Zuckerman was a young boy, Murray used to be his English teacher and he met Ira who was already a famous radio star and married. In this sense, we can have two different points of views of Ira's rise and fall -- albeit both are biased and both men loved Ira a lot. The brother tells the inside story; while Zuckerman is able to tell how the world (specially his family) saw the radio star in different periods.<br /><br />\\"I Married a Communist\\" has a plot better developed than \\"The Human Stain\\", albeit not as bombastic as \\"American Pastoral\\". But as most Roth's books, the narrative is first among equal, so is the use of language and the character development. The writer is able to inject life in every human being he proposes to create (even in the strange Portnoy, back in the past). Nothing is gratuitous in his books. Roth has a place as one of the best novel writers of the late XX Century. In his microcosms of Newark he is able to paint the world.<br /><br />Sometimes tragic (Macbeth is quoted many times in the narrative) and often funny, \\"I Married a Communist\\" as a portrait of the past bridged to the present.

Except for a few very supporting characters, nobody has a name, let alone a surname. It is supposed to make the book looks different, more modern -- or, even, more post-modern. But this supposed device keeps reminding us that they are not real people; only characters in a book.<br /><br />But, in the end, this is a mistake of McGregor. It is too confusing to try to keep track of so many plots, with so many characters and happening in different times that if the had names, it would half of the trouble. He identifies people by what they are and not who they are. It is not difficult to understand the point he is trying to prove. You are the consequences of the environment where you are.<br /><br />And the surroundings have a main role in the narrative as well. Fifty per cent of the narrative is set in the past in a street of North of England. Average people do ordinary things, but the sense of tragedy is in the air --at least for the reader. But what do the `short girl with painted toenails', the `boy with white shirt', the `couple in their thirties' among others have in common? They live in the same place, at the same time and witness the very same tragic event.<br /><br />In the other half of the book we see a narrator with what this person thinks is a big problem -- even in the XXI Century. They way the problem is put before it is told that the actual problem is lead us to think it is something so big, so desperately unthinkable, that when we discover what the problem is it is we can't avoid to say `oh, please. It is not a problem'.<br /><br />Besides not having names, this is another symptom of McGregor characters: they are so self involved (and, therefore, so selfish) that most of time we never really care about them.  He is a master to describe places, situations, moods, but his prose lacks in power when it comes to bring his characters from the paper to life. Of course, there are people who are selfish etc, but to write a book with about 300 pages populated with people like that is to be so self confident that his prose is top notch -- which is not really the case here.<br /><br />McGregor sure has talent when it comes to use words, make up places and situations, but it would be so refreshing to see the houses he's built, the acts he's invented inhabited and performed by real people. A good way of starting that is by giving his characters a name, and pretending that they are real people.bring his characters from the paper to life.

After a decade of reclusion, Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez is back with a new novel. Actually, \\"Memories of my Melancholy Whores\\" is so short that it is a novella. The size recalls back to his early works, like \\"Leaf storm\\", but we can notice a writer who is more mature, more confident.<br /><br />His prose, as usual, is singular. Nobody is able to play with words, their construction and meaning, like Gabo. His short narrative is fast and touching. The nameless narrator has just turned 90, and he has never found love. As he remembers he never spent a night with a woman he loved -- all of them were paid. And this time won't be different. He calls his friend and whorehouse owner to say he wants to spend a night with a virgin.<br /><br />After a short search everything is arranged. But that is the very moment when the narrator will find his long lost humanity. Years of meeting strange woman, writing chronicles for a newspaper and the absence of friends and family has turned him into a de-humanized being. Now at 90 it is high time to find the lost time.<br /><br />But it is not easy to enter back in the world of humans, as Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez exploits in his \\"Memories of my melancholy Whores\\". However much this novella may echo Vladimir Nabokov's \\"Lolita\\", it is Charles Perrault's \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" that is the recurrent image in the book. When people are adduced to the land of dreams, little they know what happens in the outside world.<br /><br />\\"Memories of my melancholy whores\\" doesn't have so many characters as most of Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's works, like \\"A Hundred Years of Solitude\\", and therefore easier to follow and read. And although it may not as genial as his masterpiece, it is still great prose, with well-developed characters and situations. As most of his books, this one seems to take place in a land of dreams, which makes it more special since one of the main characters spends most of time sleeping. But, it is one who is awaken that seems to dream most of the time.o dream most of the time.  <br />	2005-08-07

And this is so close to reality -- even more than 100 years after the first publication of this novel.<br /><br />\\"The Man who was Thursday\\" is set in a strange world that bears a lot of resemblance with reality -- but somehow it is not the real world per se. Subtitled as \\"A Nightmare\\", this book is indeed a strange dream.

Gabriel Syme, the main character, is a poet disguised as policeman who enters into an anarchist group to uncover the boss identity and prevent a tragedy.<br /><br />In these obscure times we live, Gabriel Syme is more real than ever. He is British police neurosis elevated to the nth. More or less something we're seeing the past few weeks, when, everybody is suspicious. However, Chesterton's characters a lighter and funnier -- what a relief. But with this novel the writer was criticizing the collective hysteria of his times that echoes in ours.<br /><br />For this reason, and for exploiting and exposing human nature so bravely, \\"The Man who was Thursday\\" is one the essential readings of the XX century. The fear of the anarchist is over, but Western world will always have enemies -- their ideology may have changed through the years, but the average citizen must have always someone whom the government and the system will protect them from.<br /><br />Throughout this \\"Nightmare\\" Chesterton depicts how people loose their sense of ridiculous and reality when under pressure. Nothing is to be what it seems to be. Like he says, `a man brain is a bomb', and he also states that bombs expand, they only destroy because they broaden.

This book is cleverly written with a narrator with a voice that at the same time is charming, funny and scary. The best quality of this novel is that it never glamorizes killing, so that the narrative is very believable.<br /><br />Lou Ford is the deputy sheriff of a small town. He looks like any guy you could know -- he seems to have nothing special. But as the narrative moves forward, one can notice that he is not what society would call a normal being. Since the definition of normality can be questioned -- some moral issues are unquestionable. Simply put, to kill a good citizen who hasn't harmed you is not a good thing. Bearing that in mind any reader knows that Ford is not a good person. He doesn't kill for pleasure -- actually he feels like it is hid duty to clean the world from the scum -- or at least, from the people he doesn't like.<br /><br />What is most amazing in Thompson's narrative is that is never judgmental. He is simply describing events, facts -- and never leads you to love or hate or to absolve or condemn Ford. If any judgment is formed, it derives from the reader's moral. Ford is not on trial in the novel. He is even charming and sometimes sympathetic -- at least until he starts to harm other people.<br /><br />When one looks close, it is impossible not to notice similarities of this book with Breat Easton Ellis' \\"American Psycho\\". But, on the one hand, Thompson's noir novel is fresh and witty, on the other, Ellis' book is boring and self-indulgent. Both are narrated in first person, but then again, the older writer had more advantages. The voice he created is more realistic and interesting -- even when Ford is having nightmares one can hardly understand -- \\"American Psycho\\"'s Patrick Bateman is boring and disgusting who can only clothes brand and things like that.<br /><br />Ellis ambitioned a larger scoop than Thompson and he succeeds in very little. On the other hand, \\"The Killer Inside Me\\" authors has much more success with his creation, bringing to life not only unforgettable characters, but also depicting some of his contemporary society's flaws.<br /><br />It is not by chance that \\"The Killer Inside Me\\" is a classic -- one of the best novels in the genre.

The writer/journalist captured a time and an event with such compromise that his words can be hardly dismissed. They are probably very close to the truth, as a matter of fact. The whole truth will never be known. After all, most of the most important `characters' of the book were dead -- actually their bloody killing was the starter for Capote's book.<br /><br />As it is largely known, \\"In Cold Blood\\" tells the story of two merciless young killers and the four members of a family they killed. While the narrative is attained to facts, Capote sometimes let his imagination to fill in the gaps. But not that often -- what boils down to in the narrative is not fiction. An strange as it may read, the writer interviewed people who were involved with the family (the Clutter's), the murders, the killers themselves, police and made his own investigation.<br /><br />The result is a book that would seem to be far-fetched were it fiction -- but it is not. Scary as the event may seem, they were real. And with \\"In Cold Blood\\" Capote explores another face of human dark side. Reading this book is like watching a documentary -- with a reconstitution of the event. There are interviews, people telling what happened to them, how the Clutter's were, all sort of things, and there is also a dramatization.<br /><br />The narrative begins very slowly as the environment is described. The city, the Clutter's place, the people until cuts to two young men, Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, who are preparing to do something awful. We don't really know what it is but we can imagine, if we know what the book is about. Capote keeps alternating between the two men and the reconstruction of that day in the Clutter's lives. A day in the live.<br /><br />The writer keeps this device until the tragedy happens. But he is smart enough to keep us jumping in our seats --since he doesn't describe the killing in the moment they happen. Only later will we learn through a flashback. An he has a point in doing it, after all, only two people could tell exactly how they happened.<br /><br />In the last part, Capote dives into another issue: capital punishment. Without taking sides, he describes a couple of people who were condemned to die and their lives in the death row, besides Smith and Hickock. At this point, we are forced to ask about our own morals. Is it worthy killing someone who has committed murder? There isn't an easy answer. And, probably, almost all of us have already a shaped opinion. Capote knows that and he doesn't try to change it. As a photographer he exploits some snapshots of a hard reality -- actually, of both sides of this hard reality.<br /><br />\\"In Cold Blood\\" is a great book. Nobody can say it is a great entertainment once it is based on a real tragedy. After all it is not a book to entertain -- this is a piece of work to propose discussions.

As a photographer he exploits some snapshots of a hard reality -- actually, of both sides of this hard reality.  <br /> <br />\\"In Cold Blood\\" is a great book. Nobody can say it is a great entertainment once it is based on a real tragedy. After all it is not a book to entertain -- this is a piece of work to propose discussions. And it has done so for all these forty years. <br />	2005-07-24

Naipaul is the most important and well-known writer from Trinidad -- a small country in Central America. His powerful fiction has surpassed the frontiers of his country, he is widely read and studied as has already been deservedly honored with a Nobel award. For one thing, his novel \\"The Mystic Masseur\\" sometimes may read as many things we have already read -- but don't be fooled, this is as original and touching as anything sparkling new that any experienced reader may find around.<br /><br />By the way, experienced readers and book lovers will certainly find another pleasure from this novel. At some point, \\"The Mystic Masseur\\" is about the love for books and all the pleasures it can bring to readers. The main character, Ganesh Ramsumair, the masseur from the title, loves to buy and read books. Shelves at his home are filled with many and many volumes from the most different book collections. Like a dream heaven for readers.<br /><br />But he also wants to write and produces his autobiography which also changes his life and his family's and friends' -- sort of. But it is not only about books that Naipaul wants to talk about in his novel. The printed word turns out to be the metaphor for life itself -- both Ganesh's and Naipaul's. As the narrative moves forward, the reader can realize that the eccentric characters of the book -- very Dickensian people -- are a slice of life.<br /><br />The fact that the narrative of \\"The Mystic Masseur\\" is set in Trinidad doesn't change its universal appeal. Naipaul's words are sometimes dream-like, sometimes evocative, but when it is required they are sharp and cut as a brand new knife -- and they hurt. But he never loses the witty. He creates the perfect environment to place his characters, filling the pages with smells, sounds and atmosphere. As Ganesh writes in his book, `everything happens for the best'. Naipaul seems to agree with him -- so should we.	2005-07-17

Largely known as narrative produced for young girls, this one goes much beyond its target reader. \\"I Capture the Castle\\" is a book that may be read and appreciated by women and men alike, no matter how old they are.<br /><br />A romantic comedy, \\"I Capture the Castle\\" keeps the light tone most of the time -- albeit it flirts with the Gothic novel sometimes. After all, the main characters have an old and abandoned castle in their backyard. The castle is as Gothic as it could be with gargoyles and towers falling apart.<br /><br />But Cassandra, the witty naïve narrator, never leaves the castle to be the center of the action. Dutifully she is the raison d'être of the book. She is a young girl, daughter of an ex-famous writer that hasn't produced anything since his first novel. She lives with her father, stepmother, older sister and Stephen -- the son of their deceased maid --in a house adjoined the castle. They lead a poor life -- actually a money, food and joyless one. Until the day two young and handsome heirs arrive. They come to claim the castle that once belonged to their grandfather.<br /><br />But don't expect the ordinary from Smith's quills. Contrary to the `natural' order, Cassandra's family do not battle against the heirs for the castle. Again, against all odds, the stepmother is not the incarnation of evil -- actually she is a good friend of the two girls. The writer only brings to the novel ideas that would unfold in a clich&eacute;d way and then subvert all of them.<br /><br />This is the biggest pleasure in reading \\"I Capture the Castle\\". The book is a narrative of sweet subversion -- so is the young narrator. A delightful voice, Cassandra has been praised as one of the best young female narrators ever (J. K. Rowling seems to agree). Extremely well developed, one may take this novel for an autobiography sometimes, rather than fiction. Her moral, intellectual and romantic dilemmas are real and interesting.<br /><br />With \\"I Capture the Castle\\" Smith produced a novel of touching and tender subversion -- funny sometimes, sad other times, but real all the time. Something that is already a reason to praise a book.r (J. K. Rowling seems to agree). Extremely well developed, one may take this novel for an autobiography sometimes, rather than fiction.

William Gibson is known as a talented science fiction writer, whose works --most notably \\"Neuromance\\" -- describe a near future. Until his latest, \\"Pattern Recognition\\". His books and short stories deal with human beings and society facing the changes brought up by technology. In his texts he has exploited the effects of the computer and the Internet -- much before it was as wide popular as it is -- in our lives.<br /><br />The differential between what he had wrote and \\"Patter Recognition\\" is that this one analyzes the effects of the Internet culture in our daily lives in the dawn of the XXI Century -- a.k.a. right here, right now. It is still the so-called science fiction, however this doesn't deal with the near --or far -- future. The novel deals with our contemporary society, and this fact brings it closer to us than any of his novels.<br /><br />Hardly has any other writer had the talent and sensibility to seriously exploit what is going on with our media and communication like Gibson does here. What does it feel like to know someone whose face one had never seen? How can we meet each other even though we are in our houses and the `guest' in his/her house? Are these new devices blessing in disguise, or what? Answers to questions like this --notoriously to the last one -- aren't easy and can be theme to a whole thesis. Knowing that, Gibson never attempts to bring up answers, he is more interested in exploiting, dissecting the effect of the texture of this new culture in our daily lives, rather than explaining reasons.<br /><br />For that he creates one of best protagonists of contemporary literature. Cayce Pollard is a young woman who works as a `coolhunter' -- an expert advising people on logos, advertisements etc. Thanks to her job -- or as a cause to have such a job -- she has an allergy to logos, advertisements and all the stuff like that (remember Julianne Moore in \\"Safe\\"? more or less like it).<br /><br />Cayce is asked to investigate a film that has been popping up on the Internet. Nobody knows where from and who is making it, but there are a dozen of websites devoted to the discussion of these video clips. As she digs the origins of these short movies, it becomes a good excuse for Gibson investigates to where our culture has lead us. At this point, contemporary moviemaking becomes one of the main issues of the novel -- although it is never clear it is really what he wants to discuss.<br /><br />\\"Pattern Recognition\\" is at its surface a thriller but is has more thrills and food for thought than most novels released in the last few years. It is high time that critics and readers as well stop looking down at thrillers and science fiction novels. Books like Gibson's latest are what make contemporary literature survive. And however its genre is we should look for novels and short stories that make us think of our social and human condition and what we have became.has been popping up on the Internet.

This time around, this magnificent writer touches the same issues of this debut but from another focus. And this time the protagonist is a girl, Gloria Wandrous.<br /><br />\\"BUtterfield 8\\" was inspired by a real incident. The body of a beautiful and young woman was found in a Long Island beach. Nobody ever knew whether this was an accident, a murder or a suicide. O'Hara ignites from this news to tell this story of a girl who leads an erratic life filled with booze, love and fun. Gloria is this young woman. The writer unveils her existence from the beginning.<br /><br />In the first paragraphs we meet Gloria in the apartment of a `strange' men -- strange meaning she doesn't know a lot of him. She is alone there and has time to walk around and examine his house. While she does it, O'Hara smartly introduces to his reader not only Gloria but also the apartment's owner, Liggett, is discovered. As the text moves, we can learn about the couple and what had happened that led them to this morning. As Gloria leaves his apartment, she takes something with her. This item will be in the center of the action until the end of the novel.<br /><br />In the next few paragraphs, O'Hara introduces a couple of characters that however not important to the central narrative, they make an appealing and large mural of the middle upper class in New York City in the 30s. His descriptions are full of life and energy. The form one character run into each other is casual and smart.<br /><br />As the narrative moves forward, we learn more about Gloria and her friends. But we also discover about Liggett and his family. Nevertheless, she is the main character and the one who has more background. The use of flashbacks is quite useful to show what lead Gloria to become what she is. At the same time, O'Hara doesn't `psychologize' his character. He doesn't try to find psychotic explanations to who she is. Neither social reason is brought up. Gloria is what she is -- period.<br /><br />This device enhances the narrative, and brings the character closer to the reader. Gloria and her friends -- and lovers, as well -- are regular human beings, leading a complex existence, just like everyone else. This is exactly what O'Hara did in his \\"Appointment in Samarra\\", bring to real existence people that in the hand of lesser talented writers would like just like book characters.<br /><br />Their dramas, fears, anxieties and joys are just like everybody else's.

Actually it is quite funny, mostly due to Dahl's touch and enchanting Quentin Blake's illustrations.<br /><br />Charlie lives in a sad world where his four grandparents have to share the same bed, they can't afford good meals or a better home. Nevertheless the boy is happy. Blake's illustration of Charlie displays an enchantment of someone who is happy on his own way. At that's the message of the book: be grateful for what you have -- even if it is not at much as you want, your luck may change some day.<br /><br />For adults, specially those who don't like books with message (myself included), this can be a silly thing. However, for kids, this is a valuable lesson taught throughout almost 200 pages with lots of fun. Dahl's book works as a metaphor of the world --albeit a perfect one, and not the real one. Again, this is not much of a problem, this idealization for young kids.<br /><br />Blake illustrations are an art apart. They perfectly translate into images Dahl's words and world. Mr Wonka is as weird as he could be. Charlie is cute and the Oompaloopas are strangely cute, too. The other kids and their family are enchanting -- albeit they are so problematic.<br /><br />\\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is a book that still enchants more than 40 years after its first publication. Both kids and adults may find reasons to love it. The young ones will find another dream -- to have a candy factory for them --, adults will find a nostalgia of a time when they could dream of having their own chocolate factory.	2005-06-19

Her novel is much more than Harry Potter, albeit both are excellent books in their purposes. The size may bring fear to some readers, but those who don't care their reading being big will certainly find a lot in this novel.<br /><br />To begin with, there is more than one single plot, but in the end they all come together. The main story follows to magicians, Mr Norrell and Jonathan Strange, throughout the course of ten years or so. Gilbert Norrell is a Yorkshire magician arrives in London with the aim of rehabilitate the reputation of English magic. After a couple of events, he becomes famous and soon the young and impetuous Jonathan Strange arranges to study with Mr Norrell. But later, after helping in the Napoleonic wars the two magicians will find themselves competing against each other. At the same time, John Uskglass -- a sort of King of the magic and other worlds -- is back to claim the throne of England.<br /><br />At some points, Clarke's text reads like the m&eacute;lange of Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Ann Radcliffe and J. K. Rowling. And this mix delivers perfectly. Of Austen she brings the society watching quality, describing meetings, people and their attitudes with humor -- sometimes black-- and irony. Her dickensian element makes social observation -- mostly of the XIX Century society strata-- plus Radcliffe's gothic elements. From Rowling, of course, there is magic.<br /><br />But Clarke is a writer of attitude therefore, one can notice some references in \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" --some intentional, and others not -- the reader can also notice the writer has a voice of her own. She writes like her novel was an old book. The most strange thing is the spelling, the use of `chuse' for `choose' or `shewed' for `showed'. These devices only enhances the pleasure of the book, that while strange is still amazing, because sometimes we are so immersed in the narrative that we don't even notice these archaic spellings.<br /><br />To make the novel looks like non-fiction she brings footnotes from time to time -- some longer than one page, some are a story of their own. Most of them read like a parody to scholar material, what make them very funny. And sometimes she ironies even the novel format. A character, for instance, says he despises novels. Those who a different from him, and immerse themselves in this huge novel will never forget it.

Nevertheless, the bookstore owner Sylvia Beach let him join and told he could pay whenever he was able to afford it. In his memoirs posthumously published \\"A Moveable Feast\\", the great writer says she had no reason to thrust him. His first choices were Russian writers -- Turgenev, Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky -- and D. H. Lawrence's \\"Sons and Lovers\\". These were the first of many.<br /><br />The episode involving Sylvia Beach and her famous bookstore/library is just one small drop in the ocean of torrential memories narrated by Hemingway of his young days in Paris. More than a recount of a period of the writer's life, \\"A Moveable Feast\\" is a portray of a time, a place and a generation. The \\"G&eacute;n&eacute;ration Perdeu\\", as writer Gertrude Stein, named Hemingway and some other expatriated writers in Paris.<br /><br />Readers shouldn't approach it expecting a report. It is a book of memoirs, an autobiography, therefore the facts and people are seeing through Hemingway's filter. It a juicy account of what he saw through his eyes. Was F. Scott Fitzgerald as problematic and negligent as he is described? It depends on who is describing him. In \\"A Moveable Feast\\" he is a tormented person, who is able to forget a trip with a friend. Was it a pattern in the behavior creator of Gatsby? It doesn't matter. Here what counts were the moments. And those days were wild.<br /><br />Hemingway writes non-fiction with same assurance he produced fiction. Real people -- Beach, Stein, Fitzgerald, Ford Madox Ford, James Joyce, Ezra Pound among others -- emerge so detailed and colorful that one may wonders if they were so interesting as described. It is very likely so, but the authors words are so powerful that readers may forget this fact -- not fiction.<br /><br />Contemporary readers could never visit that old Paris, a place where veteran writers gave aspirant ones advices in a caf&eacute;. We are lucky that we will always have Hemingway's Paris. One can never more go there and meet those people and places, but any reader can go back to this amazing book and meet those brilliant minds as many time as he/she wants. Like Hemingway says at some point, in those days they didn't trust any one who hadn't been in war, but actually they didn't completely trust anyone. This should be the same behavior expected of reader. Do not trust anyone, only those who were in loco. And not only was Hemingway in loco, he lived and experienced Paris in those days when he were poor but (or should we say `and'?) happy.here veteran writers gave aspirant ones advices in a caf.

His previous effort \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" was awarded and praised by many. That book made him one of the most talented voices of his generation -- and it is not overrating. His first novel is the evidence of his talent to work book shape and content of a novel with many layers. The curiosity which readers approach his second novel with is not gratuitous. Admirers of \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" will not be disappointed to learn that Foer has matured. His writing is stronger -- shape and content.<br /><br />One of the first fictional books to deal with September 11, \\"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close\\" can be subject of many debates. Some may argue Foer didn't deal with the due respect victims of the tragedy deserve; others may say he is making a tribute to those who either lost their lives or beloved ones. It is difficult to sympathize with both arguments. To begin with, the novel is not disrespectful to nobody. And it is also hard to believe that  the writer had in mind a tribute to the deceased.<br /><br />In \\"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close\\" the writer is analyzing the dependence, and its consequences. One fact is linked to another and leads to something else. The terrorist attack may have been the first shoot to start a chain reaction in the protagonist's life, but it is not the main event in the book. It is very smart of Foer to use them as a device to tell a coming of age tale. It is undeniable that the tragedy has changed America's psyche and forced many people -- however young -- to grow up. One of them certainly is Oskar Schell, a child whose father was in the World Trade Center in that day.<br /><br />Still mourning his father, the boy finds a mysterious key among his possessions. His quest consists in finding out what key is this, what it opens etc. His only clue is the word \\"Black\\" written on an envelope. Throughout his journey, little Oskar will come across many people and discover that every life is a story -- some happy, some said.<br /><br />At the same time, there is another story in the book. The one concerning on Oskar's grandmother and grandfather -- his father's parents. Crossing, de-crossing and  re-crossing both narratives, Foer creates dialogue between past and present that will lead characters to the future.<br /><br />He still exploit some themes he raised in \\"Everything is Illuminated\\", like the language as a tool of self manifestation --however, this time he is more radical, completely eliminating talked from one character --, cultural and social barriers and, above all, how everything is dependable. He says that `every moment before this one depends on this one'.<br /><br />\\"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close\\" is the proof that \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" is not a fluke. However much this book attests that Foer is a genuine talent, it leaves the writer in a delicate position. From this book on, readers are curious to see what he will produce next. A difficult position, for sure, but it is very unlikely that he will disappoint his readers.

He claims this is neither a novella, nor a short story -- it is just an account. And as an account it works pretty well. It is a love story -- as simple as that. What may lead readers to thing the author is either a genius or a charlatan depends on how much one expect from a narrative to tell you.<br /><br />\\"Silk\\" is a very matter-of-fact book. It is a novel in which consequences are more important than the facts themselves. Baricco style is to expose the story, instead of analyzing or `psychology-zing' his characters and the events. It is a book which exposes and doesn't judge. The analyzes is totally left to the reader.<br /><br />That can be either very genial or frustrating depending on how much you expect the reader to tell and show you. \\"Silk\\" certainly isn't for those who expected a novel with every dialogue spoken line by line. Baricco even avoids reported speech. In his words are not what were said, but how what was said unfolds in the narrative.<br /><br />Chapters are no longer than two pages. Yet still they work perfectly for Baricco's purpose. His aim is to create an atmosphere that blends both sensuality and dream.

This declaration is the heart of the matter of this amazingly well executed and brilliant book.  Naïve as she is, Isabel believes that in the 19th Century she would be able to enjoy her life and meet the world before getting married -- and not marrying is still a possibility.<br /><br />With Isabel's dilemma American writer Henry James deals with the conflict between society and individual longings. Many writers have dealt this issue -- but only a few succeeded with such grace and competence as this author.  The point is that Isabel is not the only one dealing with this problem. As a matter of fact, all characters of this novel, at some point in their life have to face the society against their personal wishes.<br /><br />James was a master of psychological development. Not a single character in this novel is unrealistic. The cast of supporting characters is as deep as Isabel. With his talent, the writer explores the psychological conflict is a result of the society pressures against the characters beliefs -- and not a gratuitous philosophy like many writers usually do. The depth brings another pleasure in the reading of the novel.<br /><br />Language is usually the main barrier for contemporary readers, when it comes to classic novels. With James it is a problem that can be easily overcome. His use of language however sophisticated is not difficult. His choice of words and structures are conscious and beautiful. The first chapters tend to be read slowly, but once the readers get the hang of James' prose, reading becomes an undeniable pleasure.<br /><br />At the same time the writer explore the psychological side of his characters; he never neglects their social conflict. In the last part of the novel, for instance, James explores the results of Isabel choices relating them to her identity -- and how one affected another. At the same time, James makes a curious choice: we never see the main events in Isabel's life, they are told to the reader after they happen. This use of ellipses happen usually when the heroine chooses to value social costume over her independence.<br /><br />As in most Henry James novels, he doesn't neglect the major conflict of this period of his work: Americans and Europeans. This time round the novel explore many American people living in Europe -- most characters are US born. If on the one hand, they represent the innocence, individualism and capability; the Europeans, on the other, are the sophistication, social convention and the decadence. But with so many Americans living in Europe how can one set the limits?<br /><br />Isabel moves from America to England and, then, to continental Europe. At each stage she loses her independency, and she realizes she cannot control her life the way she thought she could. And she realizes that there aren't many things a woman of her time could do before marrying.relating them to her identity -- and how one affected another.

An ordinary live is not that ordinary when you look it in a microscope and when you give room for the others to comment this live. However much her novel is a good achievement, at some parts she makes a way to clear what she wants to prove -- these are the moments when the book loses it lyricism and becomes too preachy.<br /><br />\\"The Stone Diaries\\" is the mock-autobiography of Daisy Stone Goodwill, a woman whose mother dies giving birth and she is brought up by a neighbor and this neighbor's oldest son -- who, years later will become Daisy's second husband. Telling that is not a spoiler, since this marriage -- and all others -- can be figured out prior to start reading the novel in the family tree displayed in the first pages of the book.<br /><br />By this family tree, any attentive reader can realize all the connections that will come in Daisy's and her relative's lives. On the one hand this diagram helps the reading, but on the other it is a lot of anticipation that is never matched by the narrative. We can discover that Daisy's son Warren marries three times, but we don't know anything about their marriages or divorces. The point for each reader is how much he/she cares to learn about the other characters if not Daisy.<br /><br />Since it is a so-called biography the focus is Daisy herself, therefore the other conflicts and characters aren't exploited in a very deep way. Most biographies we find hare thick, and since Shields accepted to play the game, she should have gone deeper in Daisy's life and times. Many things are briefly touched upon, when they could have been exploited for pages and pages.<br /><br />The alternation between narrative in first and third person is a curious device. It could be the charm of the novel, but sometimes the narrator switching only makes the narrative to loose its focus. It is curious that the first chapter in the only one entirely narrated in the first person and deals with facts that Daisy neither was there to know, nor could remember. That is the thin red line between fact and fiction in the protagonist's life. Since she is telling what she saw she is a biased narrator and all the portraits can't be claimed as realistic and fair. This is not a defect of the novel, just an option the writer made.<br /><br />While Shields tries to bring up the magic and beauty of a common -- why not say ordinary life -- she succeeds in many levels. Her prose is beautiful most of the time as well. Her book is great in the moments the writer is not trying to hard, but on the other hand when she wants to be too lyric and to touch the magic realism she overdoes her prose and sits on the fence between magic and grotesque.the only one entirely narrated in the first person and deals with facts that Daisy neither was there to know, nor could remember.

It is kind of obvious that readers who have reached this level in the series like the characters, the plots, and Adams' sense of humor -- otherwise the reader should have stopped before.<br /><br />Those who reach \\"Life, the Universe and Everything\\" won't be disappointed. The third novel has the same appeal as the two previous books. As a matter of fact they read quite one singe novel, because there isn't much of an ending the first and second one -- and a possible conclusion is reached here.<br /><br />The main innovation here is the importance of the British game cricket. Adams has found another meaning for this game, and it is hilarious most of the time. New characters and more confusion are developed again, but, unless the two other books, they lead to an ending. Not that everything is connected and tied in the end, but the bring more sauce to the book.<br /><br />It is curious to think what Adams has done for the fourth and fifth book, since the story sort of concluded here. As long as he has kept the sense of humor, the absurdity and the criticism to the contemporary society they books are still worthy reading.	2005-05-01

The whole narrative is contructed over doubles and juxtapositions -- with elements arranged into pairs. From the basic conflict of love against hate, the writer brings up the most and lest noble feelings and actions -- always making pairs and putting one against the other.<br /><br />To begin with, the narrative is divided into two distinct poles, each representing a different generation. Structurally speaking, the first part -- the one that includes Catherine, Heathcliff, Isabella, Edgard -- is stronger and more important, while the second segment works as a sort of anticlimax dealing with the love of the second generation --young Catherine, Linton, Hareton. Another double point is that there are two Catharines, being the second one the daughter of the former. They both have many resemblances, physically and psychologically. But the young Catharine is an amalgam of her mother's and father's personality.<br /><br />\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a generational drama. Two generations have to face the same problems that they parents had. But at the same time, Brontë deals with the gap of one generation to another. The same dramas do not have the same conclusion. Time has passed, minds and behavior have changed. In this fashion, the book tackles life as a process that is in constant change.<br /><br />Places are also battling against each other. The main stage for the action is the Wuthering Heights, while the other part of the narrative happens in the Thurshcross Grange. The first, as the name gives away, exploits the wildness, the extremity, the unstoppable love. On the other hand, the Grange represents the social status and the aristocracy. At the same time, they represent Catharine inability to choose between Heathcliff (WU) and Edgard (TG).<br /><br />Despite not being a success when first published in 1847, Brotë's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" became a cult with time. Nowadays it is considered one of the most important novels ever written. Not a bad change for a book that received much critics when published and the writer had to use a masculine pen name in order to be considered serious.<br /><br />As Gothic novels go, not only structurally is \\"Wuthering Heights\\" a very brave effort, but also thematically this book defied its genre.

The second novel is a sequel whose understanding and appreciation totally depend on understanding the first book. And those who didn't like the previous book are very likely to not like this one as well.<br /><br />Douglas Adams is back with his witty sense of humor and unstoppable imagination. \\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\" picks up from where \\"The Hitchhiker Guide's to The Galaxy\\" finished. But before the four humans and the robot reach the title's restaurant there is much weird adventure to come.<br /><br />Those readers who enjoyed the first book have much more here to be delighted. To begin with, besides the sense of humor, Adams has injected much more adventure in this second installment. There is much more to gasp for than to laugh at. But, as a matter of fact, it is not a problem, since the funny parts are really funny.<br /><br />In this second step of \\"The Hitchhiker Guide's to The Galaxy\\" trilogy (consisted of five books!) Adams exploit deeper the personality, fears and anxiety of his characters. For the most part of the book, the most important character that is the center of the action is Zaphod. But Arthur, Ford, Trillian and the delightfully depressed Marvin are never forgotten. In the next chapters the narrative splits in two different poles with two groups of characters.<br /><br />However little he appears, Marvin is still the best. His depressive pre-prozac behavior is one of the funniest things in the book. His interactions with other machines and human beings are unforgettable.<br /><br />The book `ends' with a perfect hook for its sequel \\"Life, Universe and Everything\\". Adams has a knock for leaving you breathless and waiting for what will come next. One can only hope that he keeps up the level of funny ideas and unstoppable adventure.	2005-04-21

She is one of the best writers able to bring light from the ordinary lives of common folks. Probably that is why most readers have a lukewarm response to her books. People are expecting to read about the glamorous and rich -- and these are not the center of her books.<br /><br />To fully appreciate an Anne Tyler book, one most be totally open to accept that her characters could be our parents, ours friends or even ourselves. It is rare to read one of her novels and not feel that one or two characters are just like us. Her Pulitzer Award winning \\"Breath Lessons\\" is not different. Her main characters Maggie and Ira Moran could be anyone's neighbors.<br /><br />Throughout the narrative readers have a glimpse on one day in their lives from morning till dawn. It is a Saturday when they will travel to attend a friend's husband's funeral service. Not an ordinary Saturday in their lives although the most ordinary things happen -- with no ordinary meaning.<br /><br />Maggie is the type who interferes in everybody's lives -- always for good, at least, so she thinks. But not everyone (mostly no one) is willing to have his/her life changed by a stranger. She tries to comfort her widowed friend, she tries to bring her son and daughter-in-law back together and she tries to please her husband. She fails and succeeds in different levels in different tasks. What Tyler is exploiting with that is hardly that the road to hell is paved with good intentions --as people say. The writer shows that no matter how good are our intentions, they can be relative. What Maggie thinks is good for her husband, for one, is not necessarily what he thinks is good for him -- and they both can be right.<br /><br />With her simple style Tyler can achieve much more than many elaborated writers attempt to. The story is told in a very matter-of-fact fashion, and even the flashbacks pop up smoothly. There aren't many digressions or flights of fancy -- in this way she is very realistic. And funny. There is a very bittersweet sense of humor in her words. She is not trying to be funny, or pushing her characters to be funny, the laughs come naturally from the strangeness --or commonness-- of the situations. Take the second part of the novel, for instance. It is impossible not to laugh tenderly at Meggie's behavior and guilty.<br /><br />\\"Breathing Lessons\\" is an ode to life and to the chances and opportunities that life brings and we accept or decline.

Animals are the main characters, but they act and think just like human beings. Don't imagine those Disney-type cute little animals. These here are greedy and dangerous - everything to have power and money, just like the human nature.<br /><br />In a farm in England's countryside, pigs defeat human beings and with the help of the other animals develop a virtually perfect farm. Everything they produce is for the own consume. There are no rich animals, no poor animals - they are all equal. It is just like a dream. But this utopia turns out to be a nightmare to the less fortunate who has no strength and power.<br /><br />It is widely known that the writer was inspired by the Russian socialism. There are many direct parallels between characters and events. A pig named Napoleon outs another one named Snowball from the farm and later on uses Snowball in his purges - just like Stalin used Trotsky. And, Napoleon becomes a dictator and Snowball is never heard again.<br /><br />However much Orwell agreed with Marx's Socialism, he didn't agree with the Russian communism in which he saw many similarities to between the communist governments and the previous czarist regimes in old Russia. This view is very clear in his \\"Animal Farm\\". Not only is Orwell's allegory important to literature, but it was also very important to international politics. Thanks in part to this book, the Westerner world could see and understand the danger of communism.<br /><br />Language and its use play an important role throughout the narrative. The use of formal and accurate language is a tool of domination. The most powerful animals are those most educated who can manipulate the ones who aren't. The governing pigs twist and distort the socialism in order to justify their acts and keep others in the dark. Orwell also dealt with the language and manipulation in his \\"1984\\".<br /><br />With \\"Animal Farm\\", George Orwell explores a dream that went wrong in the wrong hands. He shows that even the road to the socialist hell can be paved with good intentions, no matter if those intentions taste like bacon.dream that went wrong in the wrong hands.

Having that in mind, Toole is such a great writer that he should be the best friend of his readers. It is virtually impossible to write about this novel without talking about its writers sad destiny. Toole never saw his work published, and like Walker Percy says in the famous introduction it is a pitty that its creator is not alive to see the success of his writing.<br /><br />\\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" has one of the most important and memorable characters of North American literature. Flat and flatulent Ignatius J. Reilly in an unforgettable creation. So are his companions --like his mother, Officer Mancuso, Darlene, Santa Bataglia and Jones, to name a few.<br /><br />This book is the kind love-or-hate novel -- there is no in between. Either the reader starts laughing from page one and love it, or he/she finds it bore from the beginning and put it down. Those who embark on Toole's journey will be only pleased to find more laughs until the end of the book.<br /><br />Toole has a special awareness for dialogues. Much of the narrative moves through its characters lips. There are, of course, descriptions, digressions and all devices used in literature, but as a matter of fact, it is the dialogue that keeps the narrative going. And if the writer didn't have a special talent for it, the book would be a mess. The conversations are sharp, funny and witty.<br /><br />On the other pole are Ignatius's text from a book he's been writing. His texts can be at the same time funny, weird and tender. If at one point we think his ideas are far-fetched, we can't deny there is much truth behind many things he says. And he was living in the early sixties. Probably Ignatius wouldn't survive to the end of century, to the vulgarization of culture etc.<br /><br />With \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" we laugh of our own intellectual misery. This was the best advice he could have given us. Ignatius is weird, but there is a little of him inside of everyone, and that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />Toole suffered from the same malady that he uses in his epigraph from a Jonathan Swift's essay that goes like every time a true genius appears, dunces are all in confederacy against him.

Many authors are dazzled with the possibilities and open many doors that they are not able to either enter or close. O'Hara is different. He is assured of what he wants of his characters and his prose, therefore his writing reads like an experienced writer who leaves readers breathless.<br /><br />\\"Appointment in Samarra\\" begins with an epigraph from Somerset Maugham. And the narrative follows Julian English, a WASP who is atop the social leader in Gibbsville, PA. At a Christmas party he throws a drink in the face of an important Catholic businessman and this is just the beginning of his downward spiral.<br /><br />While Mr English is going down, another characters are going up. It is very interesting the parallels the writer traces in his narrative showing how one's decadence is another's ascendance. Luther Fliegler's life is the counterpoint to English's.<br /><br />O'Hara's dialogue have an important part in his prose. His words are sharp and not a single one is useless. The use of colloquial language only enhances that. His characters' lines are complemented by detailed descriptions that favor to create the whole scene.<br /><br />Many compare O'Hara to other writers from the same period like Fitzgerald, it turns out that O'Hara is not that famous- what is a shame. Because, like Fran Leibowitz said, he is \\"the real F. Scott Fitzgerald.\\" O'Hara's prose has much more depth and less romantic characters that Fitzgerald. Moreover he reads more smoothly and he talks more candid about issues like decadence and sex. In Fitzgerald's world the prose is dreamy. Nothing seems to be very real. On the other hand, O'Hara is very down-to-earth.<br /><br />\\"Appointment in Samarra\\" is a book that is very likely to please readers who like complex narratives written with an assured hand.

When he submitted the work to a publisher he almost got a contract - if not a publisher's wife had read the book and found it immoral.<br /><br />For being so candid about controversial issues, Dreiser was label as immoral - but, as a matter of fact, he was frank, touching current issues that other writers and society used to (or still do) avoid. This is one of the main reason for reading \\"Sister Carrie\\". Being an X-Ray of time like nothing else made this interesting book survive through time. And nowadays it is considered one of America's greatest classics. It is such an important book, that many critics and scholars consider it a the first modern American novel and has influenced writers like Hemmingway and Fitzgerald.<br /><br />Thematic was not the writer's main concern in \\"Sister Carrie\\". The use of language was ahead of its time. Dreiser was not afraid of incorporating slang to his text. For that, the book is a portrait of its time, how people behaved and talked - what makes the reading more interesting for contemporary readers. Although the language used was the one current when the novel was written it is never difficult for contemporary audiences. Moreover, the interesting plot and developed characters only make \\"Sister Carrie\\" very accessible.<br /><br />The plot tells the story of young Carrie, a girl who leaves her hometown to move to Chicago to live with her sister and find a decent job. But she has other plans. After attempting unglamorous jobs, she flees to live with a womanizer. But that is just the beginning of Carrie's journey down then up.<br /><br />Were it written by someone less talented, \\"Sister Carrie\\" would easily have become a soap opera. But Dreiser bring depth to his characters and situations. Carrie could have been only another 'a-star-is-born' type of character, but she is much more than that.<br /><br />So is Dreiser. With his following work (mostly with \\"An American Tragedy\\") he proved that \\"Sister Carrie\\" was not a fluke, but the conscious work of a talented writer. More than a hundred years later, his first novel is still read and very important to Literature.of character, but she is much more than that.     So is Dreiser.

The Corrected Text	Books	5	11	14	N	N	Because you cant beat them: you just flee	It is not even hard to summarize William Faulkner's monumental novel \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" in one sentence. In a nutshell it is a mystery: why did Sutpen's son, Henry, kill Charles Bon, his friend and classmate and suitor to his sister, Judith?. But one can't forget it is Faulkner and anything he wrote is just more than simply a mystery or a drama and so on. People read his books not mostly because of the story -- but actually for his narrative, for his writing. Understanding the story is a bonus.<br /><br />Regarded as one of his most difficult books --and virtually, all his books are difficult -- \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" is one of the most important novels published in the 20 Century in any language. With this book, the writer went beyond what he had done with books like \\"The Sound and the Fury\\", \\"As I lay Dying\\" and \\"Light in August\\". \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" is Faulkner in extreme.<br /><br />Here he perfects his experience in narrative -- that's why all reader's concentration is not enough. Unintroduced characters pop up, the narrative brings them (namely Charles Bon, Walsh Jones...) as if the reader were familiar with them. That is one of challenges. At first it is not clear who this people are, but once readers keep moving and gathering information those people start to make sense. Narrator also changes without much warning.<br /><br />With \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" Faulkner also develops more his stream-of- consciousness technique. In this device the inner experience of a character in a scene is contrasted with the scene's outward appearance. This is considered his greatest achievements.<br /><br />In this novel, the writer tries to exposure the moral crisis that led to the destruction of the South. \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" tells the story of a man Sutpen trying to forge a dynasty. It also is the exploitation of individuals can guide or control their destinies and win an external force or fate. As one characters believes, the protagonist's story is an example of a great and powerful man brought down by a hostile fate.<br /><br />To tell this battle, Faulkner uses multiple points of view that add or even contradict each other. For some, like Miss Rosa, Sutpen is a demon, the supernatural force of evil. While for Mr Compson he is a courageous and admirable man. Who are we supposed to believe in? Miss Rosa knew him, while Mr Compson's father was the one who was acquaintance with Sutpen. It is up to each reader to reach his/her own conclusion, or even take sides.<br /><br />One thing is certain, Faulkner has written one of the most challenging books even written. But in this case, against to what one character say, you cant beat them: you just flee. But there is no reason to flee. It is impossible to beat Faulkner so let yourself be immersed in his prose and be seduced by his work.

Fitzgerald used a Rupert Brooke verse and an Oscar Wilde line as the epigraph of his first published novel \\"This Side of Paradise\\". The verse says that in this side of paradise, the wise can find little comfort. In his novel, he'll try expose how the wise ones feel lonely and lost in this side of paradise.<br /><br />The `wise one' is Amory Blaine, a wealthy young man who goes to Princeton and discoveries that life is a little different from what he was told. Before that, he has a wonderful and extravagant life with his mother Beatrice. She loves her only son that for some readers it can be a little disturbing. By the way, by using such names (Amory from `amor' [love]) and Beatrice (Dante's muse), Fitzgerald shows what he is talking about here. He wants to explore the European tradition of love (found and lost) and the importance of love in the life of the protagonist in his growing process.<br /><br />The story is told by an outside narrator who is always adding things from Amory's point of view -- this third person narrator even knows the character's thoughts. Less than making the thread of the story, Fitzgerald prefers to draw sketches of Amory's life. In this fashion, the novel is more a character study of Amory, telling the most important moments that would help the reader to understand the character's quest to find this place in the world.<br /><br />Much of what Fitzgerald used to create \\"This Side of Paradise\\" and its characters comes from his own experience. Many critics have found much of the author in Amory Blaine. This technique of semi-autobiographical novel was often used by Fitzgerald throughout his career -- and it was largely criticized.<br /><br />But \\"This other side of paradise\\" found more acclamation and was his most commercially successful novel. In this book, Fitzgerald was able to capture a period of American history virtually like no one else, and gave a candid portrait of a new youth culture. Not only was he able to described the glamour of the period, but he also made critical commentaries on its flaws.d the glamour of the period, but he also made critical commentaries on its flaws.   <br />	2005-03-27

That is very interesting and one more proof of the author's apparently unstoppable creativity. You may not enjoy either his sense of humor, or his ideas, but you can't deny he is smart and creative.<br /><br />I approached \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is suspicion. I have never been very fond of science fiction -- and I never understood all those complicated physical and mathematical stuff--, I have always preferred something more intellectual. And I wasn't sure how comedy would work along with science fiction. To make matters worse, I've never got into books that are published in series, and become a fever, with people who can discuss them as if they were talking about the weather. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is a nightmare for me. So I decided to read Adam's first book and see what happens.<br /><br />Little did I know that I would fall for it before I reached page 20. In other words, before Earth is destructed. Although I can't recommend the whole series yet, I have to confess that I loved the first book and found it one of the funniest things I've ever read. And, it is not an easy job to make me laugh. Adams is witty and fast. So are his characters -- albeit a little crazy.<br /><br />My favorite character certainly is Marvin, the bipolar robot -- or paranoid android, pick one. He has some of the funniest lines in the novel. At some point, the reader may wonder whether he/she (the reader) is really crazy or Marvin is really involuntarily funny. I'd pick the second. My second favorite character is Ed, the hyperactive computer. These machines are dead funny.<br /><br />One can't expect realism in a science fiction comedy. Since \\"The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy\\" is a fantasy, it is not a heresy to find a robot and a computer with more feelings that human beings or talking mice. This is supposed to entertain and, after all, this is food for thought, raising questions about what life is about, what is happening to the Earth and things like that. At some point, why not consider this novel sort of eco friendly?<br /><br />\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a sort of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" written by \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"'s Lewis Carroll. Strange creatures act as if they were not strange; unusual situations are tackled as if they were usual; and a towel is the most important thing one must carry. What a (wonderful) world!<br /><br />I'll certainly read the following books in the series. I only hope they are as good, as funny, as witty and as fast as \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\". This light book is a good choice to read between to heavy and highbrow books. This is certainly one of the best treats readers any age can have.feelings that human beings or talking mice.

Coetzee's latest effort \\"Elizabeth Costello\\" is a book that defies classification. This not actually a novel, but it is not a work of non-fiction as well. It is fiction, however distant of the classic model of what we call novel, the book is sort of a novel -- for the lack of a better word. This is a book that releases a new category of its own.<br /><br />\\"Elizabeth Costello\\" follows the fictional writer Elizabeth Costello around the world when she goes to many countries to give lectures and receive prizes. Being in her 60s' makes of Mrs. Costello a wise woman and a person who doesn't seek popular-ity or celebrity -- just like her creator, Coetzee. Moreover, she is not even interested in spreading her philosophies. She goes to the events and talk about what she thinks because she feels she has to.<br /><br />It kind of relieving to find someone like her nowadays -- when most `famous' people (writers, actors, politicians etc) want to be more and more famous and make more and more money and show how politically correct they are. Mrs. Costello is a way beyond that. While her speeches and ideas are quite radical --albeit very interesting-- she is not interested in changing people's mind, in making a homogenized world. She sort of likes the difference -- as long as people don't hurt animals.<br /><br />The level of enjoyment of \\"Elizabeth Costello\\" for each reader depends on the fact that she/he agrees with what Mrs. Costello defends. If one is totally against her beliefs -- what would make this person really bad-- this reader won't certainly stand the book. For some, Mrs. Costello can be too radical, far-fetched, but it seems that this was Coetzee's idea to talk to his audience. One doesn't have to be and act like her, but believing in what she does is a great beginning to make this a better world.<br /><br />Elizabeth Costello is such a believable character that at some point we forget that this is Coetzee's voice using her as a puppet to divulge his ideas. This is one of the cases when the creation seems to assume its own life. Many times the reader is likely to find him/herself urging to read \\"The House on Eccles Street\\", a book that Mrs. Costello published in 1969. In this novel, her best-known work, the writer gives Molly Bloom (\\"Ulysses\\"'s Ulysses's wife) her own story. Reading \\"Elizabeth Costello\\" we hear so much about her book that it is impossible not to long for reading it. Unfortunately there is no such book published.<br /><br />In \\"Elizabeth Costello\\" Coetzee uses the insider experience to talk about feelings that many writers have to face. And so do readers. The most exploited is the frustration. In her speeches and lectures, Mrs. Costello never manages to please her audience and herself. She always leaves the conference that either there is something missing, or that it was really really awful. With that, the writer is saying that many times readers idealize their favorite writer -- or something like that.<br /><br />Coetzee is one of the contemporary writers who are not interested in becoming famous or making tons of money (just like gazillions that we know). And as a consequence is that his prose is very honest. He doesn't want to please people; he wants to be food for thought. The read food for thought -- not pseudo intellectual exoteric writers who claim to be genius. Just like his Elizabeth Costello.eas.

It is in the same level of Jhumpa Lahiri's \\"The Interpreter of Maladies\\". Not that the two books deals with the same subject or that they are similar. The fact is that both young writers have found their own voice very early and it is extremely well exploited in their stories.<br /><br />\\"You Are Not A Stranger Here\\" is a book that touches its reader deeply in the soul. Haslett's characters are very human with emotional problems that are too realistic, therefore, it is impossible to read the book and be indifferent. The protagonist of the first story, \\"Notes to my Biographer\\", for instance, is a man who suffers from depression and is trying to get back in touch with his son. In a superficial level, it is the story of these two men. However, the deeper you go analyzing it, one can realize this is the malady everyone is suffering in this Twenty-First Century: the loss of profound ties, the loss of connections.<br /><br />By creating so human characters, Haslett insets himself and his work in the best tradition of a realistic and poetic approach. More than glamorizing mental and emotional diseases, like depression, he brings up the hell of having to live with these problems. It is not easy and, most of the time, there is no way out. It seems that this is the reason why his characters don't expect for redemption. Because there isn't such a thing most of the time.<br /><br />In \\"Reunion\\", for instance, we have a young man who is sick and sort of giving up everything is his life. He is just waiting for death to arrive. He does not expect to be saved. He knows that death is the only thing he has ahead of him. However much the motif may sound morbid, Haslett tackles it with charm and a restrained emotion -- that never explodes. Other writers could simply bring a big explosion and a salvation in the end. But, most of the time, life is not like that.<br /><br />Probably the most disturbing story is ''The Beginnings of Grief'', in which an orphaned boy is caught in a web of sadness and a masochistic relationship with a colleague. But, on the other hand, the story is also about manipulation. About the danger of manipulating people to do what we want. Be careful with what you wish, he might be saying -- or not. Since it is such a painful story to read, Haslett may be simply trying to show us that there is so much pain in this world.<br /><br />Although all stories are top notch, some are better than other ones. Besides \\"Notes to my Biographer\\", another great moment in this book is \\"War's End\\". Set in England, it shows a suicidal depressive young man, who used to be a teacher, finds himself drawn into the life of a awfully sick child. This is one of the most complex narratives in the book, since it deals with the inversion of the poles. If at first the protagonist is the sick and dying character, he ends up find reasons to go on living with another dying character. And, despite flirting with sentimentalism, Haslett never lets the story drawn into such a device. He is always cautious.<br /><br />The first story and the last one, \\"The Volunteer\\", may be hints that Haslett is toying with the idea of writing his first novel. Not only the thematic, but also the approach and style, hints us that he can develop something longer than these short stories. He is certainly one to watch, and his first novel may grab one of the many awards that he honestly deserved with his \\"You Are Not A Stranger Here\\".turbing story is ''The Beginnings of Grief'', in which an orphaned boy is caught in a web of sadness and a masochistic relationship with a colleague.

Both spiritually and materially, this betrayal was what most people had in mind by that time, when they were living the Great Depression. This feeling is so close to this writer prose and literary project that poet W.H. Auden coined the term \\"West's disease\\" to refer to poverty that exists in both a spiritual and economic sense.<br /><br />\\"The Day of the Locust\\" is one of the best novels about the early years Hollywood, when everyone thought it was easy to be a star -- not that nowadays this has changed, but today's starlets don't have the ingenuity that people had by that time. The narrative follows the lives of a couple of characters that are associated to the movie industry.<br /><br />When it was published, \\"The Day of the Locust\\" was little noticed and was considered of `bad taste' by many critics. West's masterpiece's acclamation came with time, when reader's minds are opener to such a dark and pessimistic tale. Probably, by the time it was published, readers were so immersed in the issues that West brings up in his prose that it was difficult for them to apart from the problems.<br /><br />The narrative floats between two poles. At one side, we have very realistic features -- at the other, the movie industry looks surreal and even dreamy, what makes it very artificial, as a matter of fact. The main character is Tod Hackett, who has recently graduated from Yale University, and works as an illustrator and set designer for a movie company. He lives in the same building of Faye Greener, an aspiring and ambitious actress who doesn't date him, because he is neither handsome, nor rich.<br /><br />Through Heckett-Greener relationship, West will introduce in this book a handful of characters that are somehow linked to the movie industry and the flaw in the American Dream. One of them is Homer Simpson (no relation to the cartoon character), a kind of catatonic man who moved to Hollywood following his doctor's advice after a bout of pneumonia. He doesn't work and lives on the money he has saved. Trying to forget an uncomfortable memory he has of his love experience, he starts meeting Faye. And Tod becomes his friend of out curiosity.<br /><br />The set of characters of \\"The Day of the Locust\\" borderlines the surreal and even, the grotesque. Faye's father for instance is a man who lives in the shadow of his previous years of relative fame when he used to perform vaudeville clown. Now he his job is to sell homemade silver polish door-to-door. However, he still tries to get back to acting and find again the fame he thinks he once had.<br /><br />By using such device, West paints a cruel and realistic portray of the early Hollywood.

In the `Author's Note' in the back of \\"The News from Paraguay\\", writer Lily Tuck quotes a friend who says that nouns always trump adjectives, and in the phrase `historical fiction' it is important to remembers which of the two words is which. By using such an explanation, Mrs. Tuck is trying to justify all the liberties she may have taken while writing her novel.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, readers expect this kind of liberty to exist -- after all we are reading fiction, and not a historical non-fiction book. However, the biggest frustration that one may find in \\"Paraguay\\" is exactly the fact that the historical ties restrain Mrs. Tuck of taking flights of fancy.<br /><br />Largely researched, \\"The News from Paraguay\\" misses a lot in the moment when the writer is expect to forget fact and let fiction dominates her prose -- which is very beautiful truth be told. The narrative focuses on Ella Lynch an early Paraguayan Evita -- in other words, the woman behind the myth, Francisco Solano Lopez. She is a very peculiar character. Born in Ireland, we met her in France in her late teens when she is enamored of a Russian noble. But, after being left she starts seeing Lopez and end up becoming his mistress and moving to Paraguay.<br /><br />He is the son of the current governor of the country and will succeed his father. But Ella will never be his with -- despite the fact she will bear half a dozen of bastard kids. Lopez is a Latin man with a European personality. He wants to build an Opera house, art museums, universities, in short, he wants to make of his country the cultural capital of South America. Until the moment he reaches the highest position and becomes a harsh dictator.<br /><br />This is one of the points that is most frustrating in the novel. Mrs. Tuck never tries to bring some light to the issue. What makes such a man become such a monster up to lead his country to war that would eventually decimate Paraguay? The writer fails to explore such dark side of the human character.<br /><br />Ella is shortly developed as well. She loves her female horse, Mathilda, more than anything, more than Lopez or even her kids. However much the issue is exploited, it is never fully developed. What we have instead are snapshots of a story. The images are static. Mrs. Tuck always seems to be looking at them, instead of entering into their lives. Probably this is the style she chose to tell the story -- and it fails to please those who want more depth in the novel. Everything happens very fast, dialogues are briefly told -- and in the end we wanted to read the actual conversation, instead of narrator telling us what the characters talked about.<br /><br />In her side, Mrs. Tuck has a beautiful prose. But, then again, it doesn't work too much. At certain point she describes the image of a Saint that is covered with jewels donated by rich women who wanted favors. But it is so short that we can feel the taste in our mouth but has barely anything to swallow.

Wells' \\"The Invisible Man\\" finds the right explanation to the book itself: it is `a story of brutal self-seeking'. The fact that he is referring to the invisible man's personal story itself actually helps to make the connection.<br /><br />\\"The Invisible Man\\" is in the surface a fantasy science fiction. But it is too simplistic to reduce Wells' book to that. At some point it can be read as a metaphor of living in society or the human nature. One is only free to be what he or she is once he/she is hidden. The character only shows his true colors once he is invisible -- what is a little ironic.<br /><br />Most of the characters are archetypical, and they work fine for the writer's purpose. With that he explore different strata of his society. And however much it is a fantasy; the aspects of the human nature are quite believable.<br /><br />Wells' writing is accessible and it is not difficult even for young readers. His style is very straightforward -- even when a flashback pops up-- and there is always something happening, what never let the rhythm falls. And, Wells' sense of humor is a plus. Some fantasy and science fiction contemporary writers should read Wells and learn a thing or two with this man -- who, by the way, was very ahead of his time.	2005-03-06

When it was published in 1895, the novel received reviews that were so negative that the writer resolved never to writer another novel. But there is a reason for such a negative reception of the novel. This book attacks some of the most important institutions for the British: education, social class and marriage. His narratives are known for the tragic heroes and heroines who are in the service of his critical tone. In this book it is not different. The title's Jude isn't the only one used for this purpose. Hardy creates one of his best characters in the book: the free-spirited Sue Bridehead.<br /><br />Love and tragedy walks hand in hand in \\"Jude, the obscure\\". Jude Fawley dreams of going to a university. But he is an orphan raised by his working-class aunt, who can't afford. He is lead to a career as a stonemason. Although inspired by the ambition of town schoolmaster, Jude can't leave the village after marrying a young woman named Arabella. But their marriage didn't work, she moves to Australia.<br /><br />But another woman will touch his heart. He meets his cousin Sue, and tries no to fall in love with her. She is going to marry shortly. But she is not happy with her husband, and leaves him to live with Jude. But the problems are just begining in Jude's life.<br /><br />Hardy's narrative deals with characters living in a circle of self-erected oppression that they cannot break free. The society, that cannot accept their rejection of convention, is the main cause of this oppression. As people who chose their will, Jude and Sue are ostracized. The fact of the society doesn't accept their marriage is one of the main causes of their tragedies.<br /><br />Jude's obsession with education, going to Christminster University becomes more and more important toward the end of the book. Alongside with Sue, college represents the thing Jude aspires but can't have.<br /><br />With \\"Jude, the Obscure\\", Thomas Hardy created an allegory of the ties that society uses to keep people in the place it wants us to be.

Lawrence's \\"The Rainbow\\" is considered one of his masterpieces nowadays. The reasons in both cases are virtually the same. Completed in 1915, the book has a modern freshness that even now -- almost 100 years later -- is still fresh. This is a novel that aged well -- or better yet, hasn't aged and is always up to date.<br /><br />Banned and considered disturbed in its time, \\"The Rainbow\\" brings a formal experiment combined with sexual awakening and candidness and the praised of individualism. The events and characters are recurrent and they happen cyclically. The novel described three generation of the Brangwen family and as their world dissolves and their lives changes.<br /><br />What were most disturbing by the 1910s in this novel were the sexual passages. There weren't seen as a natural act of life, but rather were claimed as dirty. One of the most interesting moments in the narrative is a honeymoon. Beautifully --and sometimes funnily-- described the event is like an early sexual personal revolution of the couple. Needless to say that people in 1915 weren't ready for that.<br /><br />The most interesting generation of the Brangwen is the third one, focused on Ursula (she and her sister will be the protagonists of \\"Women in Love\\" published in 1917). Most of the book is devoted to her, but until we reach her there is an amazing cast of characters created by Lawrence populating \\"The Rainbow\\".<br /><br />Story moves in a special speed. It feels like the writer has create a world apart where one must surrender to its velocity in order to enjoy the story. It is worthwhile to let yourself be immersed in the place. Lawrence writing is like a travel in place and time with a destination that we may know --from books and movies-- but the way he presents it is so unique that this journey feels like new.<br /><br />Creating characters that are very human places Lawrence's literature as universal. Since his books deal with our aspirations, fears, love among other things, one --no matter where or when-- can identify his/herself with his writings. In age when one dimensional characters and disposable thrillers tend to rule, \\"The Rainbow\\" is like the sun shining in a cloudy day.

So is their book. You can enjoy it -- as long as you don't think a lot of what you read or don't ask any questions. Otherwise, you'll fall from this castle. There is no doubt that they are extremely smart and educated. Their novel has been largely compared to Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", Donna Tartt's \\"The Secret History\\" and Umberto Eco's \\"The Name of the Rose\\".<br /><br />\\"The Rule of Four\\" is not as bad as Brown's `materpiece', but it is not as good as Tartt's and it is hardly comparable to Eco's novel. What one can notice in this book is a confused mix of all these different and unique styles -- if they are good or not is another story. Caldwell and Thomason sat on the fence, undecided if they want to pursue the cheap and disposable Brown or the erudite and crafted Tartt. Eco is even far away from them -- so he is better left alone.<br /><br />\\"The Rule of Four\\" is set in Princeton -- a place the writers know well. And has a background the \\"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\\"; its name means the ''struggle for love in a dream'' of a man called Poliphilo. Paul is having a hard time cracking the \\"Hypnerotomachia\\". Apparently they don't have any problems with the fact that book is written in a mixture of Latin, Greek, Italian, Hebrew, Arabic, Chaldean and Egyptian hieroglyphics; and the whole thing may be encrypted in elaborate codes.<br /><br />Paradoxically the old  \\"Hypnerotomachia\\" is more interesting and have fresher ideas than \\"The Rule of Four\\" itself. The contemporary writers based their narrative in old devices and the very old mechanic of thriller solving, bringing up dead bodies and detectives to Princeton. Moreover, all the characters are very stereotypical representing different social portions. There is also the sweet -- but useless as a character-- girlfriend Katie. Thinking of her, Tom says some of the most embarrassing moments in the book. \\"If ever there were a time to stay grounded, to resist that struggle and that dream [alluding to the \\"Hypnerotomachia\\"] -- if ever there were a time to remember a love that has devoted itself madly to me, to remember the promise I made to Katie -- that time is now.\\" This can break one's heart. Just kidding!<br /><br />There are also scholars and librarians who are devoted to the old document. But, then again, there isn't a soul inside those characters; there isn't a heart pulsing in their chests. What is left are descriptions and one dimensional people. They don't live, they seek a book. Of course, there are obsessed people -- but even those are human beings, something that none character in this book is.<br /><br />Caldwell and Thomason seem to be two young kids who spent six years playing with their new videogame. As in this game `people' are not real they only solve riddles -- even those built in the air. It is a good idea that went bad. The old text could have been the raison d'être of a good thriller.

Published in 1937, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" was the previous work before his Pulitzer Winner \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". Set in Salinas, the novella is set against the backdrop of Depression-era America. The main characters, Lennie and George, are workers victimized by social and economical conditions of the period.<br /><br />Steinbeck's works always received mixed reviews. He was hailed and the best writer of the 30s and 40s and received a Nobel Prize in 1962, but his critics say that his writings were superficial, sentimental, and overly moralistic. When it comes to \\"Of Mice and Men\\", many say that the narrative suffers from one-dimensional characters besides the extremely deterministic plot - that in the end its lesson turns out to be more important than the characters. Despite all these drawbacks, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is still a minor masterpiece from one of the best North-American writers.<br /><br />The predatory human nature is what feeds the pages of this book. Existentialism is the subtext when the all the characters struggle to survive in a inhospitable environment. Almost every characters admit at one point having had a profound sense of isolation and loneliness .By stating this, the writer proves that being powerful in eventual and dependable. Some characters are stronger than others most of the time, and the strength depends on to whom it is aimed. \\"Of mice and men\\" suggests that the most powerful kind of strength comes from the other's weakness.<br /><br />Another strong point raised by Steinbeck is the impossibility of the American Dream. Every character in the book dreams of a different life. They want the freedom to follow their own desires. The two main characters dream of owning a farm, that would enable them to sustain themselves and would protect them from the inhospitable world.<br /><br />To prove his point, the writer uses many symbols, most of them related to animals, like the mice that Lennie insists to keep. But the animals are always weaker than men. The puppies, for instance, represents the idea that only the stronger survives - in this case men.<br /><br />But in the end, dreams have fallen apart. The characters are different and are supposed to have realized that dreams only exist in another sphere. In the real world there is no place for them. This is the same thematic that Steinbeck would bring in many of his novels, like \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"East of Eden\\". \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a short book and a relatively easy reading, but very rewarding.mals, like the mice that Lennie insists to keep.

How much of it is literature and how much is religion philosophy in disguise? This novel contains both of them, and while it can be annoying for some adults, the religion approach, kids may never realize that the book is trying to talk them into `a new form of religion'.<br /><br />Many of the events of Mary Lennox's childhood depicted in the novel mirror those in Burnett's days as a child. However, \\"The Secret Garden\\" isn't only an autobiographical novel. When writing the book, this author was under the influence of the the influence of the ideas of the New Thought, theosophy, and Christian Science movements -- which were very popular in the turn of the 20 Century.<br /><br />What Colin and Mary call \\"Magic\\" in the novel is much related to the idea that the spirit known as God held to be present everywhere, and especially in nature. These Christian Science and New Thoughts also believe in positive thinking changing people's lives, curing oneself of illness through this kind of magical thinking, or changing the character of one's fortunes. Bearing this in mind, it is clear that the characters search for a divine cure -- which might be found in the Garden.<br /><br />While most of the novel is told in an almost magical tone, near the end, the real motifs are revealed, when the children gather to sing religious songs and prayers. Much of the Christian Science is explicitly present in this last part of the novel. When one character says that \\"say things over and over and think about them until they stay in your mind forever\\" it is related to the emphasis upon the power and necessity of positive thinking.<br /><br />While \\"The Secret Garden\\" is not a bad novel, its religious content may bother many readers. It is not very preachy, but at some point, the writer abandons the shyness and spread her religion beliefs everywhere. It is her right of doing it, but it is also a reader's right to know that and decide if he/she wants to read about a group of kids finding religion and having their lives changed.eader's right to know that and decide if he/she wants to read about a group of kids finding religion and having their lives changed. <br />	2005-02-20

Maybe the fact that she was a sort of precocious genius she wrote the book helped her to sharp her senses to create a world apart inhabited by ordinary people, just trying to live their ordinary lives.<br /><br />Her condition of being young also influenced her in the novel. As most young people, she didn't have many life experiences yet; therefore much of her inspiration comes from her own life and the people she knew. Her father was a jeweler, like Mick's father. She also studied piano -- and this is one of Mick's dreams. Moreover, Mick's coming of age has a lot in common with Carson's. She started working on this book when she was at the university and her idea was to make a novel about five isolated people, in which the narrative's structure would be inspired by a fugue (a musical composition featuring several repeating themes).<br /><br />In the first part, she introduces the characters, the settings and the main thematic, which deals with of \\"man's revolt against his own inner isolation and his urge to express himself as fully as possible\\". Her main man in this case is the deaf-mute John Singer. The second part is the failure of each character, due to his options (and lack of them) and free will. The third part shows the faith of each character, and what they made of their lives after they met Singer.<br /><br />Unquestionably the main theme is the isolation and the alienation of the human being. Each character -- even the supporting ones -- tries to break out their condition. The isolation is the result of the combination of personal and environmental factors. In this process, Singer -- who has the most difficult to communicate -- plays a key role to help each of the four main characters to find their own voice. He represents the hope throughout the whole narrative.<br /><br />Carson has a hand to deal with the lost dream. Everyone in this novel cannot fulfill his/her dreams. The girl Mick, for instance, is too smart for her family, for her town; therefore she has to suffocate her talents and become an ordinary person. But, in her mind, she can keep the flame of her dream of becoming a musician alive.<br /><br />Carson deals beautiful with language and character development. From the beginning one can notice that this is a writers who dominates her tool -- and not the other way round. Every character has his/her own motivations and these people change throughout the narrative. Because of it, \\"The heart is a lonely hunter\\" is a complex slice of life. More than a book, this novel X-rays ordinary lives and expose them, bringing us a little bit of hope to diminish our own sadness.rative. <br /> <br />Carson has a hand to deal with the lost dream.

I rarely read comic books or graphic novels (nothing against them, it is just they aren't my m&eacute;tier), so I'm not biased to review a Neil Gaiman book -- actually I have never read anything wrote. \\"American Gods\\" was my first experience approaching Gaiman's universe, and it left me with mixed feelings. I know this book has won prizes and hype, but that doesn't mean much nowadays -- when prizes are rather political.<br /><br />However much I found the idea very interesting and thought provoking, I have to admit that \\"American Gods\\" is poorly executed and lacks a good editing. Gaiman seems to be the kind of writer who is dominated by the form of the book he is writing -- instead of he himself dominating the form. Due to his graphic novels experience, he seems not to give credit to his reader's imagination. The fact that a novel doesn't have images affects his descriptions, making the text over-repetitive and over-explained.<br /><br />Gaiman is what we could call a key-in-the-pocket writer. For instance, if he has to tell you that a character found something important in a room. He begins by saying that this character has a key in his pocket, then this person will get the key, introduce it in the key hole, turn it, grab the doorknob and bla bla bla... until he says that the character found a bos in the room. All the previous actions don't count to make texture or to move the story forward. So cut the beating around the bush short, please. This is where an editor would step and tell \\"Neil, my dear, let's work a little more in this text. You can thrust the ellipse. They can be effective\\".<br /><br />But, since Gaiman has a graphic novel God status, nobody seems to have courage to tell him how poor his text is. But we can't hate this writer. If on the one hand, he has all these problems with his texts, on the other, after boring you with pages of painfully useless descriptions, he comes up with such a brilliant sentence, that you feels like patting him on the shoulder, like a friend who has a problem but we are okay with it.<br /><br />But it is still something to think of how somebody writes a book with almost 600 pages and don't develop a character at all. Supposedly \\"American Gods\\" is a kind of quest that the protagonist goes through. In the beginning Shadow, the man, lacks personality and will. So, one hopes he will have acquired at least one in the end -- or that being in contact with Gods will change him. But not, this is not what happens. He is supposed to be an average guy, and that's why Gaiman made him so plain -- that's the only explanation. But Shadow doesn't have an average guy appeal.<br /><br />The narrative, that is rarely put forward, is fragmented and confusing -- in place of being epic and meaningful. However \\"American Gods\\" is a page-turner, it is never memorable. The over repetition and stereotypes character never accomplish much. I believe that Gaiman wanted to writer an allegory criticism the contemporary America -- or the Western World as a whole-- but he never delivers it. For one thing, he could start writing Americans speaking Americans, and not British. Just because he uses the word `carousel', instead of `merry-go-round' doesn't mean they are talking American.<br /><br />One of the best things of reading \\"American Gods\\" is that it made me enjoy Chuck Palahniuk's novels even more. Gaiman seems to have the same coolness of the creator of the \\"Fight Club\\". But while the American writer knows how to keep it short, moving and with a point, Gaiman is exaggerated, sometimes boring, and doesn't know where he is really heading to. He could have made a great book with \\"American Gods\\", and should start by locking the door and throwing away the key. Because, so far this is much ado about nothing.ting him on the shoulder, like a friend who has a problem but we are okay with it. <br /> <br />But it is still something to think of how somebody writes a book with almost 600 pages and don't develop a character at all.

However \\"American Gods\\" is a page-turner, it is never memorable. The over repetition and stereotypes character never accomplish much. I believe that Gaiman wanted to writer an allegory criticism the contemporary America -- or the Western World as a whole-- but he never delivers it. For one thing, he could start writing Americans speaking Americans, and not British. Just because he uses the word `carousel', instead of `merry-go-round' doesn't mean they are talking American. <br /> <br />One of the best things of reading \\"American Gods\\" is that it made me enjoy Chuck Palahniuk's novels even more. Gaiman seems to have the same coolness of the creator of the \\"Fight Club\\". But while the American writer knows how to keep it short, moving and with a point, Gaiman is exaggerated, sometimes boring, and doesn't know where he is really heading to. He could have made a great book with \\"American Gods\\", and should start by locking the door and throwing away the key. Because, so far this is much ado about nothing. <br />	2005-02-14

It sounded strange for a bunch of adults to read a book that is for 9-12 year-old kids. But, alas, it is not strange. On the contrary! That is a great idea, for many reasons. To begin with, the text has an easy vocabulary and uses words that are used in the everyday language -- different to the highbrow literature that would be impossible to a debutant read.<br /><br />\\"Nicolas\\" is also great because it is funny. Even for those who aren't French, who don't understand French Culture, they can laugh with this boy and his peers. These characters somehow make we believe that being a child is the same everywhere.<br /><br />On a deeper level, \\"Le Petit Nicolas\\" can be an effective sociological portray of being a child in the early 60s in France. The garçon's life shows a middle-class family dealing with `problems' --ok, not very serious one, this a book for children, after all-- like not having a TV, or when the kid has low marks. But, everything is dealt with a funny approach.<br /><br />With his peculiar vision of the world --everything is seen through Nicolas' eyes-- and his `problems', this little boy shows to the grown-ups who delightful it can be to be a child. Even if we have forgotten that.	2005-02-13

The narrative gravitates towards two different kind of speech -- both not easy to read. The first we can find is a very literary narration, slow and sometimes meditative; the second device is the use of the rural Southern black dialect.<br /><br />However, the use of both structures has an important raison d'être. By alternating the two different voices, Hurston is exploring and exposing the culturally rich voices that inhabit the novel protagonist's world. At the same time, these voices also represent Jane in the quest for her own voice. So, speech has a very important role in this book, and for enjoying and understanding this narrative, the reader must get the hang of it.<br /><br />\\"Their Eyes Were Watching God\\" tells the story of Jane Mar Crawford, a woman ahead of her time. Her strong personality insists on finding love and freedom, but both things never come together and it takes her almost the whole novel to realize so. Before that, she will face awful marriages and relationships, prejudice against gender, age and color, among other things.<br /><br />It is very likely that many other writers would be very preaching when telling such a story, but Hurston avoids this tone. And however she touches upon issues like racism, never is it by all means the main theme of the novel. This point is subtly raised throughout the narrative. Therefore, the novel is more about the human condition in general rather than a distinctly African-American one. Like Alice Walker once wrote, \\"I think we are better off if we think of Zora Neale Hurston as an artist, period-rather than as the artist/politician most black writers have been required to be.\\"<br /><br />By the way, if nowadays Zora Neale Hurston is regarded as an important American writer, this is thanks to Alice Walker -- who brought us her text and pointed out its importance to the world literature. And however Hurston and her works are associated with the Harlem Renaissance, her books can be discussed in another context.<br /><br />The biggest criticism that the writer faced when she published the novel was that \\"Their Eyes Were Watching God\\" was not a political novel. And despite the fact that many people thought it by that time, nowadays the fact of not carrying a political or moral message proves the strength and beauty of the book.ointed out its importance to the world literature.

Maybe the fact that she was a sort of precocious genius she wrote the book helped her to sharp her senses to create a world apart inhabited by ordinary people, just trying to live their ordinary lives.<br /><br />Her condition of being young also influenced her in the novel. As most young people, she didn't have many life experiences yet; therefore much of her inspiration comes from her own life and the people she knew. Her father was a jeweler, like Mick's father. She also studied piano -- and this is one of Mick's dreams. Moreover, Mick's coming of age has a lot in common with Carson's. She started working on this book when she was at the university and her idea was to make a novel about five isolated people, in which the narrative's structure would be inspired by a fugue (a musical composition featuring several repeating themes).<br /><br />In the first part, she introduces the characters, the settings and the main thematic, which deals with of \\"man's revolt against his own inner isolation and his urge to express himself as fully as possible\\". Her main man in this case is the deaf-mute John Singer. The second part is the failure of each character, due to his options (and lack of them) and free will. The third part shows the faith of each character, and what they made of their lives after they met Singer.<br /><br />Unquestionably the main theme is the isolation and the alienation of the human being. Each character -- even the supporting ones -- tries to break out their condition. The isolation is the result of the combination of personal and environmental factors. In this process, Singer -- who has the most difficult to communicate -- plays a key role to help each of the four main characters to find their own voice. He represents the hope throughout the whole narrative.<br /><br />Carson has a hand to deal with the lost dream. Everyone in this novel cannot fulfill his/her dreams. The girl Mick, for instance, is too smart for her family, for her town; therefore she has to suffocate her talents and become an ordinary person. But, in her mind, she can keep the flame of her dream of becoming a musician alive.<br /><br />Carson deals beautiful with language and character development. From the beginning one can notice that this is a writers who dominates her tool -- and not the other way round. Every character has his/her own motivations and these people change throughout the narrative. Because of it, \\"The heart is a lonely hunter\\" is a complex slice of life. More than a book, this novel X-rays ordinary lives and expose them, bringing us a little bit of hope to diminish our own sadness.rative. <br /> <br />Carson has a hand to deal with the lost dream.

One of the best and first works to deal with this battle is Sinclair Lewis's famous novel \\"Main Street\\". He had already a good reputation when the novel was published in 1920, and it became an instant bestseller, making of \\"Main Street\\" one of the biggest literary events up to that point.<br /><br />Contrasting to most of his works, \\"Main Street\\" is a novel of dark and pessimistic tone, satirizing the life in small towns in the early 20 Century. And however it may sound a typical theme for contemporary readers, Lewis was a pioneer when it comes to the conformity, narrow-mindedness and the individualism that rule in such place. These critics are made through the eyes of the main character, Carol Kennicott.<br /><br />She is a young woman from Minneapolis that marries a small-town doctor and settles to his hometown. Her dream is to transform a prairie village into a place of beauty and culture. At first, Gopher Prairie seems to be the perfect place to make her dream come true. Little did she know that her project would be restrained by the other citizens -- notably the social elite, which, by the way, lacks a cultural polish.<br /><br />Carol's first action is to redecorate her husband's house and hold a little party to meet her new friends. The event couldn't be more disastrous. And from the beginning she can notice the narrow-mindedness and the hypocrisy of that people. But she is stubborn enough not to give up. Her next step is to join the women's social and study club, but in both of them her ideas are categorical ignored. At the same time, she has the right feeling of being watched.<br /><br />Her attitude brings problems to her marriage, and her husband, Dr Kennicott accuses her of feeling superior and being snobbish. This argument will be a constant in the narrative as a counterpoint of Carol's idea of perfecting Gopher Prairie. The narrative unfolds in the conflict between Carol's wishes and the town people inability of opening their minds and changing.<br /><br />Lewis brings an interesting contraposition when he presents Bea -- who ends up being Carol's maid. This girl finds Gopher Prairie a beautiful and modern place. Using such device, the author attests that the modernity and beauty are in the eyes of the beholder. For Carol, the village is provincial and people lack culture and refinement.<br /><br />Thinking of the historical context of when the novel was published, we can realize that Carol's wishes and desire social reform and individual happiness reflects her particular era, when labor movements grew and women at last achieved the right to vote in 1920. But his prose is a double-edged sword. While he attacks small towns and their people, Lewis is also against the superficial intellectuals who look down on those people.r Prairie.

In Daniel Keyes' \\"Flowers for Algernon\\", Charly, the main character, is in search of these things -- with that, the writer pose a simples question: what makes us what we are? Charly is a mental disabled thirty something who accepts to go through a surgery that is expected to improve his intelligence and make him a `normal person'.<br /><br />The very same procedure has been successfully done to a white mouse, named Algernon. After Charly meets the hamster he is impressed of how smart the animal is, and believe that he can be even smarted than it. And he (and his doctors) is right. After the intervention, the man's IQ is skyrocketed. He starts to learn contemporary and dead languages, understand economy, geopolitics, and science... anything. Charly is a sponge that absorbs as much information as he comes across.<br /><br />But, like everything in life, there is an on-the-other-hand. Charly past memories -- that seemed to be lost somewhere in his mind -- start to arise and they are not pleasant. Most of them are related to how their parents dealt with his inabilities when he was a child. Both of them weren't able to deal with a special kid. And, while the father tried to seek for some help and loved his son, the mother pretended he was normal, at first. After another daughter is born, his mother starts to avoid Charly until she forces the father to commit him to mental facility.<br /><br />As these facts are remembered, Charly's mind starts to play tricks on him. What was real? What was a dream? What has he made up? There aren't simple answers for that. But he wants to clarify these points. At the same time, Algernon, the mouse, starts to show the first sings of deterioration. He is not as bright as he used to be. Moreover, Charly becomes a sort of celebrity in the medical world. His doctors want to show him in a convention as the living proof of how their methods can increase intelligence and help everybody -- not only disabled people.<br /><br />Everything is told by Charly, who writes compulsively reports about his evolution. One of the most interesting things about \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" is its language. At first it is like an illiterate child, with many grammar and spelling mistakes. As Charly's mind starts to evolve, so does his language and ability to express himself.<br /><br />But, little did Charly know that mankind is more complex and difficult than he could imagine. He starts to realize that the people he thought to be his friends are not really friends, and when love comes up, the man realizes that it is a complex feeling and no matter how bright you are, it is always difficult to deal with this feeling.<br /><br />Keyes has created a magnificent cast of characters. From the believable Charlie to his teacher and lover Alice, everyone is very human. His parents are beautifully developed. And however much you may hate the mother for how she treats her son, you can't blame her. The doctors, mostly Nemur --who is believed to have done something important for the mankind-- are part humanist, and part mad scientists, like Dr. Frankenstein -- and at one point, the creation surpasses the creator.<br /><br />\\"Flowers for Algernon\\" is considered science fiction. But this is one those books that makes you think and consider a many ethical and moral issues, when you try to bring the plot to real life. This is kind of science fantasia that we should encourage to be largely explored in movies and books, so that in the real world we would never take such a dangerous step.e and help everybody -- not only disabled people.  <br /> <br />Everything is told by Charly, who writes compulsively reports about his evolution.

US	49577356	R1UKIWKBC6PAC7	0679723420	755867934	Pale Fire	Books	5	7	9	N	N	First impressions: a personal review	Vladimir Nabokov has always been one of my favorite writers. I've read \\"Lolita\\" twice and think I'm not quite finished yet with this book. Since I like his writing and ideas so much, I thought I should try his \\"Pale Fire\\", a book that has been highly recommended to me by many people, and that looks difficult and challenging enough for me devote my time. It turns out these impressions weren't wrong.<br /><br />\\"Pale Fire\\" is brilliant, certainly one of the best books ever written in English. It is difficult. Nabokov's language, approach and style are labored enough to drive any experienced reader insane. And, despite the fact that I can't say I totally understood the book, I'm willing to tell that I loved it. Why? Because every word sounds brilliant and placed in the right place where it is supposed to be. Because his style and structure were demanding, and as a reader this is what we should look for: something different from the usual, something that would challenge our minds.<br /><br />The writer toyed with the idea of hypertext much before it was a trend. Compound of a poem and its comments, reading \\"Pale Fire\\" makes the reader goes back and forth to follow the poem and its interpretation. But, this is not the only hypertext structure, in the comments, every time the writer mentions another line etc.<br /><br />However strange it may sound, \\"Pale Fire\\" still has a plot. Actually many plots -- like any good many-layered book. One of the plots deal with the \\"Pale Fire\\" poem writer and his relationship with his neighbor, who happens to be the writer who is annotating the poem. There is something sick going between these two and their tacit dispute to see who is more brilliant. On another level, there is another story -- something a little magical, a little political-- involving a king.<br /><br />Due to its complexity and brilliance, Nabokov's \\"Pale Fire\\" is a book (it is tempting to say `a novel', but it is not really a novel -- it is more a book of literary critic or something) that deserves multiple reading. I'm sure that every time we read this superb book we'll find something new that only proves what a genius this magnificent writer is. His words prove that he says, \\"True art is above false honor\\". \\"Pale Fire\\" certainly is one of the truest forms of art possible, and I'm willing to reread it in a couple of years.y critic or something) that deserves multiple reading.

His novels reads like a patchwork achievement copying with many characters in three different periods in the life of the protagonist Ruth Cole, when she deals with things like grieving, lost and tragedy.<br /><br />We first meet the Coles in the Summer of 1958, when she is only four and her mother Marion is dealing with the death of her older brothers in a car accident. The woman, always described as `a difficult woman', believes she cannot be a good mother to her daughter, who, by the way, was planed as a way of replacing the dead boys. Depressed and unable to lead a normal life, Marion embarks in a love affair with her husband's teenage assistant.<br /><br />The tale moves fast to 1990, when Ruth is a famous writer who is unable to have relationships with men. Again, she comes across her mother's ex-lover, Eddie O'Hare, who is also a writer, albeit less successful than her. Both they discuss Marion and what may have happened to them. The final part of the story is set five years later, when Ruth seems to be finally ready to fall in love.<br /><br />However difficult it is to say that Irving's novel has a plot, it is easier to believe he has written a chronicle of many years in Ruth's life. In this case, there are the recurrent people who surrounds her -- like her alcoholic father (who is also a very famous children writer), her friends (notoriously the delightful Hannah) and Eddie (who is on and off her life from time to time). In this fashion, the novel is a great achievement, once the characters are very believable.<br /><br />Of course, the most interesting character is Ruth who shares many resemblances to her mother -- mostly psychological. It is easy too see how her childhood experiences --many from when she was four -- affect her throughout her life -- mostly when it comes to being in love or men in general.<br /><br />The supporting characters are very human as well -- an achievement that not many writers can reach nowadays. Marion, for instance, vanishes from the novel for about 200 pages, but we still can feel her presence and influence (mostly in Ruth and Eddie) all the time. Not only her daughter wonders what may have happened to her, but so does the reader.<br /><br />Not only is Irving able to write a great story but he also has a great command of the language building beautiful sentences that have a dramatic effect without being corny. His talents make it worthy to follow three different periods in the life of this lady.

He has sharp prose, inventive plot --with even more inventive twists-- black (but not always cynical) sense of humor and a huge love for mankind. The last part may come as a surprise. But it takes a humanist like him to write about people in general and always save them.<br /><br />Palahniuk's work is always dealing with saving people usually form a dead-end existence. In \\"Diary: A Novel\\" it is Misty Winston's turn to be save and, at the same time, save the day -- or not. It all begins with her comatose husband lying in a hospital bed after trying to commit suicide. Her husband was a contractor and now, many of his clients are having problems with their houses -- rooms are simply disappearing. Once a promising painter, now Misty works as a waitress in a hotel and she has seem all her dreams of becoming a famous painter disappear.<br /><br />But things are about to change! Misty talent suddenly returns and she starts to paint again. And make lots of money -- what makes everyone in the island where she lives pretty happy. But like everything else in life, it has a price -- and it is not a cheap one. That's where the biggest plot twist in \\"Diary\\" lies.<br /><br />As Palahniuk's plot unfolds, his novel starts to resemble Ira Levin's \\"The Stepford Wives\\". There are many things in common -- like the isolated community, the search for an ideal of perfecting and enhancement, and the horror setting that makes us feel that something bad is about to happen all the time.<br /><br />Like all his previous works, \\"Diary\\" is filled with interesting information that is cool to be used when you are chatting with your friends, just to make you sound smart and cool. If in \\"Fight Club\\" we learned a lot about soap and human fat, in \\"Diary\\" there is lots and lots of information about graphology, Carl Jung and something called Sthendal Syndorme. It Palahniuk is making everything up -- or if he's been doing a lot of research to write about those things -- is just a detail, because every little detail he writes about is so cool that you don't care he is telling the truth or not.<br /><br />Again, his characters are more archetypical than regular human beings. But, then again, this is cool in his novels. I wonder if somebody can write and create alternative worlds like he does. I doubt we can find another writer just like him. He is unique and this is what makes us love his books -- even when we think he's being a little repetitive.  Who cares? It is cool to read and quote Palahniuk. It always makes you sound smart and modern.

Well, it turns out that her novel is not better than her previous book. But, that doesn't mean that this is a bad novel -- actually it is pretty good. The point is that her collected stories were so good that she set her standards too high, and some readers were disappointed.<br /><br />The second controversy -- and this some people seem to be a way too harsh or narrow-minded-- was whether she can or not write long narratives. Taking \\"The Namesake\\" as exhibit one the answer is yes, she can, thank you very much. No matter how long her narrative is, Lahiri has absolute control of the language, plot and character development required to all good novels. If we feel that her narrative has some highs and lows -- this is not really a defect that is common in most books we read nowadays. And, mind you, her lows are not that low too qualify her debut novel as an awful book.<br /><br />\\"The Namesake\\" cover about thirty years in the lives of a group of people having as central character Gogol Ganguli -- named after the famous Russian writer. The story of the man's name is worthy a book itself -- actually it is the central issue of the novel, most of the time. The Gangulis are a family of Indian that move to United Stated and have to establish their lives there. What rises as one of the most important themes in the novel -- and that is also present in Lahiri's \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" is the cultural clash between the two civilizations, or in other words, between Western and Eastern cultures.<br /><br />Gogol is the product of his time and place. The man can nor connect to the US's culture, not to India's. He is a person who is torn between two worlds and can't come to terms to accept neither of them. Due to Lahiri's background and work, it seems that this is (or was) an issue that the writer has faced in her life and work.<br /><br />Her prose is astonishing -- and so is her lexicon. The choice of words is crucial to develop her characters and their lives. And she never fails to choose the most beautiful and useful word to build her sentences.<br /><br />After her two books, Lahiri is one to watch. Her books will be talked about for years to come.

Both are young and sensitive, and, what is more interesting, is the fact that they have a very romanticized vision of wealth and love, and felt in love with a young woman when in a military camp in South.<br /><br />Nick starts his narrative telling that his readers an advice his father gave him, telling that when he feels like criticizing someone he should remember that he is not in a position of doing so, because he has had many advantages in his live. Beginning with that, it is sort of a disclaimer as if the writer is telling that in his narrative he is just portraying a story, rather than making judgments on the events and people. Smart movie -- since most of the novel reads like a big criticism against the lost of the American Dream, due to money and corruption.<br /><br />Nick is learn bond business, and lives in New York. He rents a house in the West Egg district. His neighbor seems to be wealthy and happy -- he is throwing parties in an everyday base. One day he goes to East Egg to visit his cousin Daisy and her husband. He meets young Jordan Baker, a young woman who claims to know his neighbor. He is Mr Gatsby. She also tells him that Tom has a lover.<br /><br />Days later, Jordan invites Nick for a meeting and tells him about Daisy and Gatsby. They used to date before the war. And now, the man wants that Nick and Jordan arrange a meeting for him and Daisy at Nick's. Once the couple meets again, the tragedy starts in the characters lives.<br /><br />By telling this American Tragedy -- and loss of American dream -- Nick is very contradictory. To begin with he is making judgments -- not following his father advices --alternating moments when he is very objective, and moments when he seems to give his own interpretation of the facts.  What also has resonance in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is the nostalgic tone adopted by the narrator. He seems to be telling about the end of a civilization that no longer exists, and at the same time he feels guilty for its destruction.<br /><br />On another point, Nick/Fitzgerald is criticizing the hollowness of the upper classes. This is the part when the book has a sociological --and not only literary-- interest. The West Egg citizens represent the noveau rich; while the East Egg ones are the aristocracy. The newly riches are vulgar and have no social grace or taste. Gatsby is his most effective example of that. But the aristocracy, on the other hand, lacks heart -- they don't care if hurt other people. Ironically Gatsby's best qualities (love and loyalty) are what lead him to the tragedy.<br /><br />\\"The Great Gastsby\\" is a very short and entertaining book.

US	49577356	R1L624LOVCVXZX	081297106X	635066654	Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Lives that are more fictional than fiction itself	At some point, the writer Azar Nafisi points out in her memoir \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran\\" that the lives of hers and her students --and many women in Tehran-- seemed to be more `strange' than fiction. Were her book a fiction it would probably be considered far-fetched -- but, since it is a book of memoirs, it is scary to discover things that those women had (and have) to face.<br /><br />The book accounts some years in her life while she was an English professor at University of Tehran and how she was `forced' to start private lessons at her house after the school became too restrictive. Her idea was to gather a group of her most talented students --the ones who liked literature most -- and meet them every week for discussing a Westerner classic novel.<br /><br />Coming from the most different backgrounds --just like the books they read, from Nabokov to Jane Austen-- these students bring a lot of cultural, sociological a political value to the book. Nafisi thoughtfully descriptions bring these women to life. And so do the political events that Iran faced in the period cover by the book.<br /><br />Her pages are not only by this unusual book club, but, above all, about Iran dominated by a repressive and destructive mentality -- in a state where religion and power walk hand in hand. The oppression and humiliation those women (and most Iranian people in general) suffered are heartbreaking. Therefore, Nafisi's book is a statement of atrocities that should never be forgotten and avoided at all costs.<br /><br />To make a counterpoint, her literary divagations are light --and insightful-- but at the same time deep, like she says, `her passion was her task'. It is more bigger a pleasure if Nafisi's readers have read or are familiar with most books she mentions, like \\"Lolita\\", \\"The Great Gatsby\\", Austen's novels.<br /><br />Nafisi, her students and her books become such friends, that it is sad to say goodbye to then when we reach the last page. For over 400 pages, we learned and cared so much about the lives of those people that in the end we feel like we need to know more and more about them.<br /><br />People who love book we'll feel deeply connected with those women's passion. At one point Nafisi quotes Flaubert and says \\"you should have a heart in order to feel other people's heart\\". And with he book we can go a bit further: one must have a reader's heart in order to feel other reader's heart.es, we learned and cared so much about the lives of those people that in the end we feel like we need to know more and more about them. <br /> <br />People who love book we'll feel deeply connected with those women's passion.

No that the novel doesn't have plenty of information, but that there are so many interesting things that we always want more and more. The first thing that any reader will want is to see the tapestries are so often mentioned in the novel -- actually they are the subject of the novel. The six of them hang in Mus&eacute;e National du Moyen Age (aka Cluny Museum) in Paris. And if you are not fortunate enough to be in Paris when you read this book, you can rely on the internet.<br /><br />But it is not necessary to spend too much time researching. Chevalier's website has almost infinite information of the tapestries, the Le Viste family, medieval tapestries so on. That's why her website is the right place to go while reading her book -- actually it is good to go there for any of her books.<br /><br />In this fashion, Chevalier is one of our contemporary writers who can make the best use of his/her personal website. More than being the means of advertising her work, or a place for exhibitionism, this writer brings new and useful background information about her books. It turns out to be essential to the understanding and enjoyment of her historical prose.<br /><br />\\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\" is named after a series of French tapestries made in the XV Century. They are the link between the lives of a family of nobles and family of weavers. The only people who can transit the two poles (the nobles -- the working family) are the artist Nicolas des Innocents and the merchant L&eacute;on Le Vieux.<br /><br />Nicolas was hired by Jean La Viste to draw a series of tapestries. They are supposed to be about war -- however, La Viste's wife persuade the artist to talk her husband into making them about the story of a lady seducing an unicorn. At the same time, Nicolas, who is a kind of conquistador, seduces the La Vistes' eldest daughter. The concerned mother tries to separate the couple.<br /><br />In the next segment, Nicolas goes to Brussels to work with a weaver in his workshop in order to produce the tapestries. Transiting between these two poles, Chevalier is able to draw portraits of both the nobles and the working class who are both related to the tapestries -- the ones who own them, and the ones who make them.<br /><br />Using the same device Chevalier used in \\"Falling Angels\\", each chapter is narrated by one different character. The writer is talented enough to make each one a distinguished voice, what makes each one of her narrators/characters very believable.<br /><br />Just like Chevalier's previous novels, \\"The Lady and the unicorn\\" is a fast and entertaining reading -- filled with beauty and interesting background. Her characters are lively and the story is sexy in an old fashioned way -- or sometimes in a very modern one. A book that won't disappoint her fans or debutant readers.st daughter.

Hadn't the play writer written \\"Death...\\", \\"The Crucible\\" would certainly be regarded as his unique masterpiece -- however, I believe the honor must be shared-- which is not that bad for readers and audiences.<br /><br />Performed for the first time in 1953, \\"The Crucible\\" is loosely based on the famous Salem witchcraft trials that happened in 1962. Miller used the actual even as an inspiration to create a fable that resonated in his time's politics -- which was called the witch hunting. The play was written in response to Senator McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee's crusade against supposed communist sympathizers. Despite the changes, as Miller states in a prose prologue to the play, his objective is to \\"the reader will discover (...) the essential nature of one of the strangest and most awful chapters in human history\\".<br /><br />At the end of the play, one can be sure that the writer achieved his aim. \\"The Crucible\\" paints with the right paints a portray of mass hysteria, paranoia, chaos and manipulation. What's more, it achieves a higher level when it manages to deal with the 50s politics -- which happened to be touched by mass hysteria, chaos and manipulation as well.<br /><br />As a whole, the symbolism in the play is the paranoia about communism that pervaded the United States in the 1950s. with his text, Miller managed to bring up several parallels between the House Un-American Activities Committee's rooting out of suspected communists during this time and the seventeenth-century witch-hunt. In both cases, the narrow-mindedness and the excess of zeal ended up blinding people. Like in Salem, the communists were encouraged to name names and confess their `crimes'.<br /><br />In \\"The Crucible\\", Miller's concern is not to with the fact that the accused are witches or not -- but rather with the unwillingness of the court to believe they are not. In this case, in the McCarthyism era, so full of excess, many innocents were condemned, and this parallel is what resonates from Miller's words even more than 50 years later.<br /><br />Miller vaguely based his characters in the actual ones, but in his prologue, as a disclaimer, he alleges that he was forced to make many changes. Abigail's age for instance was raised, the judges were symbolized by only two etc. But, as he explains, this is not a historical work.<br /><br />One of the most impressive points in the play is the theocratic society --where church and state are one, and the only allowed form of religion in Salem is the Puritanism. The witch trials represent the expression of intolerance --while the hanging is the means of restoring the purity of the community. On the other hand, hysteria plays the role of tearing this society apart. It supplants logic and people start to believe that people they have always known are not what they believed to be. Abigail is the character that has an important role triggering this hysteria, since she wants to marry John Proctor, and for that must get rid of his wife. Others simply use her device --while others fall into her trap. In the end, the community is into pieces.<br /><br />As one of the characters says that was `a strange time'. So was when Miller wrote his play -- and so is today. That is why Miller's \\"The Crucible\\" is such a timeless piece. Reading this play --opposed to watching it performed -- is an enhancing experience.

D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" has assured its place in the literary cannon. Dealing with issues that were too hot for the 50s --like adolescents talking so openly about sex, and drinking and smoking-- the magnificent novel faced some negative critics by that time, but after the 60s it started to be regarded as it deserves to.<br /><br />One of facts that made \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" so popular is the fact that Salinger tap into the emotions on the readers in a way it had never been done before. And in the 60s --with the counterculture --, the book was seeing as the story of an individual's alienation within a heartless world. By that time, the novel's protagonist, the unforgettable Holden Caulfield, represented young people all over the world who were dissatisfied with the political and cultural moment.<br /><br />As the plot of the novel is widely known, nowadays it is much more interesting to review and comment it rather than simply summarize. To begin with, the main character, Holden, is a person who cannot connect with other people -- that's why he is always moving from one place to another. The only supporting character who has two different moments with him in the novel is his youngest sister Phoebe -- all the others appear and disappear only once, like his schoolmates, a girlfriend and a teacher.<br /><br />This absence of connections seems to run in the Caulfield family for a little while -- since the youngest son Allie died. This death, alongside with the suicide of one of Holden's schoolmates, has an important resonance in the protagonist's life and attitude towards the world and other people. It seems that he has always been let down by others (parents, friends, siblings...) and he (un)consciously decide to stop connecting with people.<br /><br />Moreover, he is very judgmental of everything and everybody. But this peculiarity makes of Holden a very human figure. Most adolescents behave in this way. He is always criticizing and philosophizing about people who are boring, insecure or phony (like he says all the time). Probably this kind of behavior disguises his own fears and insecurities. He is hardly close to any adult. The only one who tries to establish a tie with Holden is a former teacher, Mr Antolini (who, by the way, happens to be the most human adult in the novel, but it is normal, since Holden is narrating the story). However, using a lame excuse, the boy fails to establish any emotional tie even with this man. As a matter of fact, he cannot have an emotional tie with anyone even with his little sister, who he claims to be \\"little too affectionate sometimes\\", when she tries to embrace him.<br /><br />Therefore, Holden is the kind of person who usually victimized himself -- as he says to an old teacher, he feels on \\"the other side\\" of life. However, the more we learn about him, the more we know that this alienation is a way of protecting himself. The connection -- or even interaction -- with other people confuse and overwhelm him, and his cynical sense of superiority serves as a type of self-protection. But this alienation turns out to be the main cause of his pains.  He needs love and contact, but he can't deal with them when he has them.<br /><br />Probably Holden's loneliness is the main motif in \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" -- that in the end is a bildungsroman, a novel that shows the growing of a young man into an adult. His lack of structure to connect to others haunts him throughout the whole narrative. This problem results in his absence of having intimate relationships and even close friends. It is so clear to most readers, but Holden himself can't see it. It feels like when we are in the center of the problem we cannot see the solution.<br /><br />Reading \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is an unforgettable experience to any reader, be he/she and adolescent or an adult. Probably the best approachis to read this novel in many periods of one's life. The response will be different every time. But good old Holden will always be the same: impossible to be caught.he response will be different every time. But good old Holden will always be the same: impossible to be caught.	2004-12-28

As far as the search for spiritual values go, they can't be found in money, sex or in mundane things-- therefore, the book and its protagonist and narrator embarks in a quest to find those values in another place -- but not most of the time.<br /><br />This man, Binx Bolling, is a Korean War veteran coming up on his 30th birthday. His family is an old and eccentric New Orleans rich clan. However he is the black sheep, since he quitted the medical school and work as a stock broker. He also moved to the suburbs and spends his time mostly making money for his clients, dating his secretaries and going to the movies. In this sense, Percy wrote the typical bachelor's life, that is at some point superficial and comfortable.<br /><br />More than a hero, Binx is an anti-hero, virtually molded after Percy himself. Like his creator, the character comes from an old-money family and had a suicidal father. The suicide becomes an issue in their lives. Since the opening quote in \\"The Moviegoer\\", the writer proves that suicide has an important role in the novel.<br /><br />In Binx's life, one of the most important characters is his cousin Kate --to whom he is more involved than he wanted to be. She is the only one who he can be frank to. Both of them are kind of self-aware in a world of faux people, who pretend things they are not, or don't believe. However. Binx and Kate deal in different ways when it comes to the fact they `live in a world apart'.<br /><br />He prefers to go through the motions, wandering around, acquitting the most information he can, going to the movies. But these pieces of information are sort of banal most of the time. What he really cares about are the details, such as the lives of the movie theater employees, his half siblings. Comparing Binx's attitude to the movies he goes, it is like he was more interested in the technical achievement of the films, like cinematography, set and costume design etc, rather than the plot and character itself.<br /><br />Kate, on the other hand, despite living in the same world as Binx is aware they are different. At some point she says, \\"You're like me, but worse. Much worse.\\" She realizes they live in the same world, but she has another approach to life. She doesn't search and observation, she lives in her own crisis. That is one of the reasons that her character is so human and profound.<br /><br />During the course of weeks we follow them, both lives are dramatically changed --mostly Binx's. He tries to bring substance to his life -- which he felt was missing. Kate, love and God have an important role in this quest. In the end, she is a different person herself too. And probably the reader's life won't be the same as well. Walker Percy's masterpiece is likely to bring a lot of new points and quests in everyone's journey.Comparing Binx's attitude to the movies he goes, it is like he was more interested in the technical achievement of the films, like cinematography, set and costume design etc, rather than the plot and character itself. <br /> <br />Kate, on the other hand, despite living in the same world as Binx is aware they are different.

D. Salinger's most popular and most read work. People who read this book are die-hard fans of this writer and really like the Glass family and are interested in knowing more about them. Those who want to read only one or two Salinger books should stick to \\"The Catcher in The Rye\\" and either \\"Franny and Zooey\\" or \\"Nine Stories\\".<br /><br />To begin with \\"Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction\\" is not an easy book. Its rhythm is like a roller coaster, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes up, sometimes down -- but always difficult and inaccessible to those who are not familiar with the Glass's mythology and history. Even Salinger habitu&eacute;s may find some difficult in reading this work.<br /><br />\\"Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters\\" tells the story of Seymour's wedding. But, the main character here and narrator is Buddy Glass, the groom's brother, who is the only member of the family to attend the ceremony. All the narrative deals with the fact that Seymour abandon's his bride in the church and doesn't show up.<br /><br />Buddy is forced to deal whit the situation. He is forced to be with some guests, who happen to be bride's relative. And most of the time he pretends not to be Seymour's brother. Like most Salinger's work, the most important thing in the narrative is the character's thoughts rather than his actions, words etc.<br /><br />While considering this event, Buddy recreates most of his family's history. And this is a valuable account to those are interested in learn more about the Glasses. So far, sort of a typical Salinger writing.<br /><br />The second part \\"Seymour: An Introduction\\" is more difficult and problematic to those readers. First thing is that is not an introduction -- at least not our typical introduction. First off, because the reader is already familiar with Seymour, from \\"Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters\\", or from \\"A Perfect Day the Bananafish\\" (from \\"Nine Stories\\", which happens to be paradoxical, since the short story tells an event that happens later on in the character's life).<br /><br />Buddy who describes his older brother -- who he happens to admire-- again narrates the story. The narrative this time round is like a labyrinth rather than a roller coaster. The images are formed without a correlation, the narrator jumps from topic to topic making the understanding of his words rather difficult.<br /><br />Those who are interested in only one Seymour story should go straight to \\"A Perfect day for Bananafish\\". It is short, but you'll learn a lot about the character -- actually almost everything you need to know is there. Those who like Salinger and his Glass family, are welcome to read \\"Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction\\", but be advised that it is different (not bad, just different) from what you've read from him, about them.Stories\\", which happens to be paradoxical, since the short story tells an event that happens later on in the character's life).

Salinger is one of those writers that one either loves and thinks he is a genius, or hates him and finds him a practical joke. I, certainly, include myself in the first category. The more I read his works, the more I admire his style and geniality. \\"Franny and Zooey\\" has become one of my all time favorite books. It is short, a quick read -- but at the same time very profound and touching.<br /><br />Divided in two parts, each named after each sibling, the book basically tells the story of Franny nerves breakdown. In the first part we meet Franny, who meets her boyfriend for a football weekend at his college. While they are having lunch she tells him about the phoniness at school and of the egotism of the facult, what is making her sick. She also says about a religious book, in which she found the Jesus Prayer. It is supposed to be a very powerful prayer, which goes \\"Lord Jesus, have mercy on me\\". It is very simple and one must say it all the time, until it becomes as natural as breathing. This prayer is supposed to meant to cleanse one's spirit. On the way to the toilet she faints, and when she is revived, Franny begins to say the prayer.<br /><br />The second part, named `Zooey', takes place some time later, and it picks up from where the first one finished. It is narrated Buddy Glass -- an older brother of Franny's and Zooey's. In the Monday right after the girl's breakdown he is at home in New York. This part consist in dialogues and an old letter from Buddy to Zooey. Every dialogue features only two characters, either Zooey and his mother, or his sister -- or only the two women.<br /><br />It is very powerful what the writer can bring up with his dialogues. We learn that the two of them have basically been raised on a blend of different religions, taught to them by their older brothers Buddy and Seymour (see \\"Nine Stories\\"'s \\"A Perfect Day for the Bananafish\\" to learn a little more about Seymour). Zooey try and help Franny sort out her spiritual and personal beliefs, trying to bring peace to her.<br /><br />Salinger is able to explore a great variety of issues using Franny's breakdown as an `excuse'. Not only are mysticism and religion explored but also family, celebrity, education, and intellectualism. Religion, God, Jesus and personal beliefs play an important role throughout the narrative. The family plot deals with a family of geniuses that can't handle their geniality. The relationship between the siblings -- mostly Franny & Zooey, and Seymour and Buddy -- is very complex. The younger ones resent the education they received by their older brothers.

Not only are mysticism and religion explored but also family, celebrity, education, and intellectualism. Religion, God, Jesus and personal beliefs play an important role throughout the narrative. The family plot deals with a family of geniuses that can't handle their geniality. The relationship between the siblings -- mostly Franny & Zooey, and Seymour and Buddy -- is very complex.

Both works share a lot in common: they are set in the 80s when the world was changing in a strange way, AIDS has just become the issue, and both have its country politcs in the background (USA: Ronald Regan; UK: Margaret Tatcher).<br /><br />The 2004 MAN Booker Prize winner is a novel that takes a little time to grabs one attention -- but once it does so, it is hard to put it down. It covers a couple of years in the lives of a group of people, all related to Nick Guest, young man who has moved to the elegant house in Notting Hill that belongs to the parents of one of his best friends. This family sort of becomes his second family.<br /><br />But Nick is never really connected to the Feddens, for many reasons. One of them is that they are wealthy and futile, whereas he is not. Another one is the fact they never really deal with his homosexuality. They seem to cope that but never accept it. But politics in England in the 80s play such a major role in the narrative the homosexuality has a supporting part sometimes.<br /><br />The book focus on is the climate of giddy success among well-to-do Tories between the electoral victories of 1983 and 1987. The patriarch Gerald Fedden has just entered Parliament and wants to fulfill another political ambition: to host the PM at home for a party. Eventually when it happens Hollinghurst delivers some of the best pages of social and cultural delight and critic of his novel. For pages and pages he teases his reader in the best possible way, announcing that something big will happen -- but one can never be aware of what will happen. One critic has wisely compared the appearance of \\"The Lady\\" to the presence of Kurtz in ''Heart of Darkness,'' who both are invisible until near the end.<br /><br />Hollinghurst has a special obsession for beauty and its forms -- and this is totally explicit in the title of the book. But his prose also has its own beauty. The writer's choose of words is remarkable, as well as the way he builds his sentences. At the same time, Hollighurst gambles with another of his main themes: Henry James. Nick is working on a thesis about this writer, which turns out to be a good excuse to inject some Jamesian comments throughout the narrative.<br /><br />Many readers maybe shocked with the honesty that sexuality is dealt with. This concern only enhances the experience of reading the narrative. Nick's sexually naivety and awakening is believable and never gratuitous. And all the characters have enough personality and humanity to fill a whole book on them.<br /><br />Hollinghurst won a deserved Booker Prize with his novel, which has much more consistence and smartness than last year's \\"Vernon God Little\\". Giving the Prize to \\"The Line of Beauty\\" brings back the hope that it is indeed a literary prize and not just a fashion contest.d its forms -- and this is totally explicit in the title of the book.

US	49577356	R18CCBE5QN1YX1	0316769509	595009960	Nine Stories	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Nine great reasons to read this book	Most people, virtually everyone, knows J.S. Salinger form \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", and despite the fact that many people love this book, not many of them try and read another works from this author. Actually people stick to reading and rereading \\"Catcher\\", instead of moving on to another of his four published books. \\"Nine Stories\\" is a good chance to read more brilliance written from Salinger.<br /><br />Each story has an inner strength that makes it compelling and touching.  From the first one \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\", until the last one, \\"Teddy\\", the writer enters in a specific world dealing with people who are in the edge of their existence, their human condition. And throughout the narrative they will be forced to deal with their situation. The confrontation may happen or not, but they are given the chance of doing so. The characters feel alienated from the people in their lives.<br /><br />My favorite stories are \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\" and \\"For Esm&eacute; --with Love and Squalor\\". It is interesting that only later I noticed that them both share so much in common. The two texts have as main character men who served in World War II whose lives were profoundly affected by this experience.<br /><br />\\"Bananfish\\" tells the story of Seymour. The first part concerns of his wife having a phone conversation with her mother while the couple is in a hotel. It is throughout her talk that we learn who her husband is and his mental health. The way Salinger unveils his characters -- Seymour specially -- is very subtle. From the beginning, it is virtually impossible to know who the writer is aiming to; until he starts to focus on Seymour. The second part of the story deals with the man himself. We first see him on the beach and that's when we understand why it is `a perfect day for a bananafish'. And why he is so tormented.<br /><br />\\"For Esm&eacute;\\" starts while Sergeant X is in Europe and while he is in a caf&eacute; he meets the young girl Esm&eacute;, whose intelligence and sensibility are impressive. During the course of a few minutes, they develop a strong friendship. Probably Esm&eacute; was the tie to the world that was missing in Sergeant X's life. As improbable and complex as this relationship is, this is faded to an ending. But even being far from her Sergeant X manages to fulfill his promises.<br /><br />The other seven stories have the same theme and approach that is like Salinger's signature. Characters are so well developed that one feels that has been reading a novel, and not only short stories. This book will probably please people who like \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" and is expecting more of Salinger's flawless and deep prose.course of a few minutes, they develop a strong friendship.

Not only because her debut \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2000, but also because she has gather an immense group of fans. And none of these facts are true by chance. This writer deserved them both.<br /><br />\\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" is a collection of short stories - some already published, and some new. What is more impressive about this book is Lahiri's command of the language. It can be stunning the way she can display simple words side by side to create a complex effect. This is an ability that many experience writers have never succeeded. But to make the experience more complex and delightful this writer is a chief storyteller. Her characters and plot are as complex and beautiful as her language.<br /><br />Lahiri  has a clinic eye for detail -or better for detailing the ordinary lives of ordinary people making them very unique. This is a device that she shares with Raymond Carver - who was also a master for this kind of short story. Analyzing the first text in the book, for example, \\"A Temporary Matter\\" and we see a couple, that used to love each other, but are falling out of love. The way the display their emotions and feelings couldn't be more Carverinian. The surprise comes from the absolutely unexpected - that at the same time sounds plausible.<br /><br />With a foot in the modern future and an eye in the traditional past, the writer gave her stories a global dimension. They are set in many different cities, like Boston, Orissa, Bengal, Cambridge. But she is able to portray all of them with accuracy and, above all, passion. There isn't a single word that wasn't crafted with a lot of passion and intelligence. In the end, this is the kind of book that also enriches one's vocabulary - but using uncommon words doesn't make Lahiri sounds pedantic. On the contrary, this is a device she applies to create the strangeness of the disconnected world where her characters inhabit.<br /><br />These people aren't eccentric or bizarre; they just are the way they are - and this is another major achievement. They are people trying to tie lose ties of their lives - may them (the ties)  be with other people, with a new country or the old one. This way, the writer created a map of the disconnected human heart in search of something new (or even old) to link itself to.<br /><br />With elegance, beauty and passion, Lahiri builds her stories - until the last one, that has a reason to be placed in the end of the book. By the end of this text, \\"The third and final continent\\" we understand where we had been through the previous stories. The last lines resonates everything we had read until them. And it can break and heal one's heart.ers inhabit. <br /> <br />These people aren't eccentric or bizarre; they just are the way they are - and this is another major achievement.

But she is a peculiar teacher. She doesn't care spending her class times with mathematics, history, English and all other regular subjects. She prefers to explore life, to teach her set of students --the chosen ones-- how to deal with life, love, friends and have good manners. Of course she will have problems with the school administration.<br /><br />This is a summary of Muriel Spark's most important novel, \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\" in a nutshell. And however the book is really short, it has a wide range of subject and characters. The writer explores not only the life of her heroine but also the existence of a couple of her students. Part of the characters is very human and part is rather archetypical. It would top notch if the author could have transformed all of them in human beings. However it turns out not to be a problem, since the narrative is quite entertaining and an interesting portray of a time.<br /><br />The best creation is, of course, Miss Jean Brodie. She sounds stereotypical some time, some times a little naïve, but never uninteresting. She has advices for everything: \\"speech is silver, but silence is golden\\", a window can be opened more than six inches, it would be too vulgar; and so it goes. While for her girls they are quite important, for the readers they can be rather amusing. It is impossible to one not the wonder weather those advices are for real or some far fetched thoughts from Miss Brodie's mind.<br /><br />Using the style of anticipation, early in the narrative we learn things that will only happen many years later, like the fact that one girl will betray Miss Brodie, and that another one will become a Sister. This device may put off some readers due to the fact it cuts short the surprise in the narrative.<br /><br />However much I liked Miss Brodie and her adventures, I've never felt really connected to the book. There was always something missing to make me sink in the narrative and in the lives of the characters. Maybe a lack of emotion --most of it read a little to superficial to me--, or the theme --this may be a novel that have more connection with girls. But, I still recommend \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\". It is a fast an interesting read.ng missing to make me sink in the narrative and in the lives of the characters.

When he does that, he usually says that `in this sentence the word means this and that'. His novel is cool, and in this sentence this word means that it is funny, fast and interesting -- both to kids (early teens on) and adults.<br /><br />\\"The Bad Beginning\\" is the first book in his \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\". As the title spoils it is not a happy reading, and the writer is kind enough to advise readers in the first page, telling them that if they prefer they could go for another kind of book -- a happier one.<br /><br />Those who brave enough to go on may be a little surprised -- or not. Surprise is not the main quality of this short novel. But it doesn't come as a problem, as a matter of fact. The fun in this first book is actually seeing how the evil Count Olaf will try to steal the three Baudelaire orphans fortune and how they will escape from him.<br /><br />Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire are three siblings who have a nice and wealthy life until the day their parents die in a terrible fire that destroyed their house. After that, they are force to live with Count Olaf, a distant relative, but the only one who lives in town. It turns out that the man is evil and has some kind of obsession with eyes -- he has images of eyes hanging everywhere in his house.<br /><br />He is an actor, and while his out the children are forced to do all the housework. The only friend they have is a neighbor called Justice Strauss. In the meantime, Count Olaf tries to come up with a plan to reach the siblings' money. And he has a perfect plan.<br /><br />Most of the fun of this little book comes from the narrator, Mr Snicket, rather than the narrative itself -- after all, it is a sad story and we're not supposed to laugh at other people's misfortunes, aren't we?<br /><br />It reads easily -- even for young readers -- the vocabulary is accessible, and so is the narrative. The characters are stereotypical but it is something common in books target for that audience.<br /><br />\\"Harry Potter\\" fans may find some new reading material here. The story may be not as dark and `complex' and the little wizard's, but it is still a good adventure after all. Adventure in this sentence means something that will not put at the edge of your sit, but it won't be boring too.eaders -- the vocabulary is accessible, and so is the narrative.

Argentinian Julio Cort&aacute;zar comes as one of the most important authors to seek such structure with his monumental novel \\"Hopscotch\\", written in 1964.<br /><br />Not only history did influence Cort&aacute;zar in his writings, but also European Vanguards have a major role in his literary project -- most notably Cubism. The non-linear narrative of \\"Hopscotch\\" makes its structure reads like a hopscotch game. Reading the novel feels like jumping from one square to another, back and forth. Using that, the author tries to violate the rules established of writing and narrative structure.<br /><br />If one chooses to read \\"Hopscotch\\" in the linear fashion --both ways are possibilities -- there are 155 chapters in three sections: \\"From the Other Side,\\" \\"From This Side,\\" and \\"From Diverse Sides\\" (subtitled \\"Expendable Chapters\\"). And in the introduction the reader will find a \\"Table of Instructions.\\" There, we learn that two approved readings of the book are possible: from Chapter 1 through 56 \\"in a normal fashion\\" (i), or from Chapter 73 to Chapter 1 to... well, wherever the chapters lead. Each has a numeric indicator of the subsequent chapter following its terminal sentence. In this way, we do not know which chapter to expect next until it is time to actually read it.<br /><br />Horacio Oliveira is an Argentinian writer living in the bohemian Paris of the 50s. After losing her lover, known as La Maga, he returns to his Buenos Aires to continue his picaresque adventures.<br /><br />Another structure used in the novel is the labyrinth -- like the labyrinth of streets where Oliveira usually meets La Maga in Paris. And this also alludes to an emotional labyrinth to which both he and she will be trapped. By the way, emotion -- not the regular one-- has a major role in the narrative. All Oliveira's friends are somehow emotionally damaged -- trying to cope with their depression and problems.<br /><br />However much the structure sounds like off putting, the novel reads smoothly once one gets into the cubism of the narrative. Needless to say that the reader must appreciated the bohemian way of life -- including alcohol and drugs, and art discussion -- to be interested in the book.<br /><br />With his \\"Hopscotch\\", Cort&aacute;zar defies his readers. Playing this game is worth the candle. Experienced readers will be delighted with the structure of hypertext and all the possibilities of reading this novel.All Oliveira's friends are somehow emotionally damaged -- trying to cope with their depression and problems. <br /> <br />However much the structure sounds like off putting, the novel reads smoothly once one gets into the cubism of the narrative.

As far as the cultural, social and political portray of a country goes, this is his major goal. The writer has lived the situations he describes -- albeit it is not a memoir -- being to those places, and suffered those politico-social pains. His characters are also very human -- and it is not impossible to feel related to them. But the minor flaw in this novel is the second part, filled with action sequences that sound so much like a movie. It feels like Hosseini was so willing to please his Eastern readers that he let a bit of Hollywood to guide him.<br /><br />Actually it is not really a problem or something that spoils the book. It is just that the first part --the childhood and adolescence of the main character in Afghanistan is so colorful that the second part sounds a little pale. However, Hosseini deserves kudos for dealing with such a complex and dangerous subject as the contemporary politics in his country.<br /><br />The first part chronicles the childhood and adolescence of Amir, the son of a rich businessman in Kabul. His best friend is Hassan, the son of his father's servant. Both boys are inseparable and among their favorites actives are playing with kites and creating fantastic stories involving warriors and mystical events. But a tragic event will fall them apart.<br /><br />This misfortune will haunt Amir forever -- even after he and his elderly father have moved to USA, to try a better life, after their country was ruled by communists and dominated by Russian army. But, the character will have a chance of redeeming himself when he receives a call from Afghanistan. Going back to his country in a mission was the chance he may have been longing his whole life. However, once he arrives there, Amir realizes that that place is not the one he knew anymore.<br /><br />However much the second part of the book sometimes reads like a Hollywood script, \\"The Kite Runner\\" is still an important novel, because it was written by someone who lived that situation, and saw his country ruled by the Talibans. Hosseini tackles the politico-social subject with honest and explores how they can affect the emotional life of a country. In the pos September 11 world, his novel acquires more than tragic dimensions. Afghanistan became a virtually unknown world. And the book's portray of the country feeds the Eastern readers so avid for cultural and political information of that place.

The experience of reading this short book can be very difficult to most of us at first, but, once we get used to the magical ideas and the writer's style the narrative flows smoothly.<br /><br />Juan Preciado returns to a town called Comala, a place his mother left when he was just a baby. That is literally a ghost town -- there are many dead walking people. On arriving there he finds out that his father, a landlord, was a tyrant and people didn't like him. Preciado is taken by some spirits and guide through the story of the city and its death, brought on by Paramo.<br /><br />Evil and chaos arise from Paramo's hand in the story. That's why Comala has been destroyed. In the early days, the landlord, with the assistance of the church, leads the whole town to corruption, philandering and decay. As a consequence violence suffuses the city. Miguel, Paramo's son, is the personification of that. He is a serial rapist and ends up killed by his horse. When Susana, Pedro's love interest dies, he shuts the entire city down mandating that the farm become dead and funding revolutionaries.<br /><br />For most, what maked \\"Pedro Paramo\\" a difficult book is the style of narrative chosen by Rulfo. His text reads like the hopscotch. Narrative swifts time and place easily -- and to understand the changes and new narratives, the reading of this novel requires double attention. The story can jump which jumps between Juan's dealings with the residential ghosts of the town, his channeling of the non-ghost souls those departed who exist in a mental limbo, and non-linear retelling or straight narration of the past.<br /><br />In his narrative, the author is dealing with the tragedy -- in an experienced level rather than in a viewed level.  The effect intended by the writer is a simple one -- with that he brings his readers closer to his narrative. Contemporary authors try to dead with that, but not many are as successful as Rulfo -- one of the best positive examples is Gabriel Garcia Marquez that with charm and style mastered his own narrative having with basis Rulfo's proposition.<br /><br />\\"Pedro Paramo\\" is a highly recommended book.

Robert Ludlum's \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\", the follow up to his \\"The Bourne Identity\\", has most of the same elements he used in his previous book, but this time things do no work as smoothly as before. The second installment in his trilogy lacks the electrifying and neat narrative that is so cool in the other book.<br /><br />Apparently more than one Jason Bourne is back. In the prologue a man is killed in Hong Kong. The crime is attributed to the legendary killer, but it was not one of his moves. As a result, there might be a civil war in China that will lead to a global disaster. The only person able to uncover the conspiracy is David Webb, a.k.a. Jason Bourne -- the real one.<br /><br />As it follows the narrative has less character development than in the previous book. Jason Bourne is more focused on action, than discovering who he is -- they may be a consequence, but it is not his priority. That's one of the reasons why this second book is less interesting than \\"Identity\\".<br /><br />Needless to say that the action is most of the time beyond the belief. This is not really a problem in the spy thrillers -- if the action were to `normal' there wouldn't be much fun. This kind of novel is hardly naturalistic; otherwise this would be too boring. But the action is too confusing most of the time.<br /><br />The readers follow two groups of characters: one `led' by Bourne, and the other by his girlfriend Marie. At some point both ends of the narrative will converge, but when it happens, most readers are so tired of trying to figure out what is going on, that they may not care anymore.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" is one of the rare cases when the movie is much better than the book. Paul Greengrass's film is much more interesting, well developed and made than the book.

S&eacute;bastien Japrisot's novel \\"A Very Long Engagement\\" hardly fits one single genre. The book is at first --and most of it a war drama--, but at some point --still early in the beginning-- the narrative is also a love story. As the pages move, the novel becomes a thriller. But, above all, it is a fable. Just check the first sentence, the classic \\"Once upon a time...\\" The result may generate mixed feelings among the readers, but not by chance.<br /><br />As the story goes, \\"once upon a time, there were five French soldiers, who had gone off to war because that's the way of the world\\". From the beginning we meet the five soldiers. Japrisot describes with details who these soldiers are, and where and why -- actually not much of the `why', after all, this is the quest of the book. Then we're introduced to Mathilde, a young girl, whose fianc&eacute; was one of the five soldiers -- or so the thinks.<br /><br />Years later, she receives a letter from a dying man, claiming to have information on her boyfriend. This is the beginning of Mathilde's journey, which will take many years until its heartbreaking conclusion. Throughout her quest, she'll come across the most different kind of people, some will be helpful and others not. Because that's the way of the world.<br /><br />The non-linear narrative is enhanced by the many devices used by Japrisot. From digressions to flashbacks, and many letters, the readers discoveries events before Mathilde. However, one will be able to fully understand some pieces of information only later -- when the girl can place the piece on her giant war jigsaw.<br /><br />The gallery of supporting characters is as colorful and the main ones. Mathilde is a strange girl. Confined to a wheelchair since her childhood, she has created many different lives inside her mind. At some point, one wonders if this fianc&eacute; really exists. There are many small plots surrounding Mathilde's secondary lives -- but it will all converge in the end.<br /><br />The five soldiers also have a special place in the narrative. Alongside with their friends, wives, children, they become a portray of the human condition, affected by the WWI. Letters from both sides are the perfect device to give dimension of their dramas.<br /><br />As the narrative advances, it becomes stranger, until its surprising climax. With this novel Japrisot (1931-2003) proved to be a great storyteller, whose talent will be largely missed.d. <br /> <br />The five soldiers also have a special place in the narrative.

US	49577356	R2JHPDCY1EAXQC	0395389496	546953115	The Polar Express	Books	5	3	3	N	N	To whom the bell tolls	Not many children book can transcend its target audience. Luckily Chris Van Allsburg's \\"The Polar Express\\" can reach readers who are older than 8. But, however much this book is appealing to adults, it still may not find many readers among teens. But there is a reason for it: this is a story for those who still believe in Santa Claus, or for the ones who wish they could still believe. Teenagers are usually a way to cynical to identify with one of these definitions. Well, maybe when they get older.<br /><br />The narrative is very appropriated. From the choice of words to the story itself, it totally fits the universe of a small kid. The use of simple words, along with short sentences, makes it an easy read for those who are learning how to read. To make the task easier there is a great amount of descriptions and comparisons. They are abundant, but not redundant or boring.<br /><br />The narrative is enhanced by the amazing pictures -- but neither is repetitive, they complete each other. Despite all the illustration, the writer is smart enough to leave room for his reader's imagination. This work of filing in the gaps mentally is not privileged in many children's books that most of the time tells and shows everything -- therefore the young reader never have a imagination exercise, and become a lazy reader expecting to learn facts and figures from the narratives. However, this is not the case in \\"The Polar Express\\".<br /><br />This is a story of a little boy who is having second thoughts if Santa exists or not. He is invited to join a trip to the North Pole, where something magical will happen -- involving Santa Claus and a little bell.<br /><br />In the world of Van Allsburg, less is more. The illustrations are not heavy or with too many details. They are simple, but not simplistic. The lack of small details makes the reader focus on the main action of every picture. This is a smart move by the writer/illustrator.<br /><br />There is also contrast of images. During the travel to the North Pole, outside the train is cold and dangerous. While inside is very warm and cozy. My favorite illustration is the first one that shows the inside of the train with children and two men serving \\"hot cocoa as thick and rich as melted chocolate bars\\".<br /><br />It is not difficult to notice that the use of light in Van Allsburg's work reminds of Caravaggio. The beam of light is directed to the central action of the illustration. In the first time we see Santa Claus he is the only one receiving light, while his elves and surroundings are in the shadows. This shows the character's dimension, like his a God of his own world.<br /><br />This is a book highly recommended for children and nostalgic grown-ups. It is also the perfect Christmas gift for almost everyone.es. During the travel to the North Pole, outside the train is cold and dangerous. While inside is very warm and cozy.

These two writers define what we know as the noir literature. Personally speaking, I found it more pleasant to read Hammett than Chandler. Both writers are great, and deliver the best in the prose, character development, settings and all, but I found \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" more interesting than \\"The Big Sleep\\" and \\"Farewell, my Lovely\\".<br /><br />Hammett's prose is straightforward. He doesn't waste time with digressions and many descriptions -- only the essential. As a consequence, his novel is packed with action and mystery. It is not a surprise that this author writes with so much authority -- he used to be a private detective. Most of the book --if not the whole narrative --feels like getting inside information.<br /><br />Hammett's style became a paramount in this genre and he has a major influence on many contemporary writers -- e.g. James Ellroy, Jeffery Deaver, and the French Jean-Christophe Grange among others. Hammett's prose is filled with witty observations on the American way of life -- mostly on the violence and corruption that were permeating the American Society.<br /><br />Contrary to what many contemporary readers may wrongly assume, the older mystery novel is not as prudish and conservative as it may sound. Hammett's prose is more related to the 20s than the 50s. And in that early period society was looser than after the McCarthyism. Therefore, \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" can be a grateful surprise to many readers -- who will find drink, drugs, sex and sexual orientation (the Cairo character's sexual orientation has been largely discussed since the book was published).<br /><br />However we are almost all the time with Spade, the reader has no access to his thought. It is the reader's job to reach conclusions and put the pieces together. And we can learn this from dialogues, events and mostly Spade's reactions and facial expressions. But this is not a hard job for the reader -- on the contrary, this is one of the best features of Hammett's style.<br /><br />Of course, the movie version of the book is very famous --and almost as good. But it is always an irreplaceable pleasure to read Hammett's words. And to meet Spade before he `had' Bogart's face.l expressions.

Written when Thomas Mann was in his mid-20s this novel is one among his innumerous masterpieces. From the beginning, the author displays an eye for details, for character development among other qualities, but the major characteristic of the book is to show how global events can affect a family.<br /><br />This device is very subtle in Mann's narrative, therefore appealing. The Buddenbrooks are in the center of the events, but the world --which by that time wasn't `global' yet-- was changing and it reflects in the familiar dynamics. Every now and then, economy and politics are the main topic of a chapter, but it is always reflecting on the Buddenbrooks.<br /><br />They are a rich family that is losing their empire. As the time changes, so do the member's mentality -- or not. This is one of the most touching issue in the book. Many people can't come to terms with the changes. Most Buddenbrooks are linked to past that is over.<br /><br />The novel covers four generations of this family. As the narrative unfolds, it is the last Buddenbrooks that will suffer more the lost of their money and position. It is very interesting to follow their decline -- from the rich beginning until the unfortunate ending.<br /><br />The members of the family are very vivid and human -- and with that, Mann brings up a complex human panel. But all of characters are very active and attractive to the readers. Each of them has their motivations and mind. But it seems that narrow-mindedness runs in the family. Every Buddenbrooks who tries to go against the family's will is suffocated. Tony is forced to marry someone who would make a more profitable marriage than the man she loves. Christian is forced to quite the arts and his way of life because it does not please his brother. And more members will suffer with it.<br /><br />Starting as a family chronicles, \\"Buddenbrooks\\" ends almost like an epic. The Noble Prize winner writer has set the pattern for this kind of book. Many were influenced by Mann's style and topic -- even those who don't know it. I think that Lanpedusa's \\"The Leopard\\", DeLilo's \\"White Noise\\" and Jonathan Franzen's \\"The Corrections\\" are among the books that received a positive influence from the master.le Prize winner writer has set the pattern for this kind of book.

From teenaged sniper to sexual scandal, the list gave an interesting scope in the contemporary English literature. A previous winner like Margaret Atwood was side by side of newcomers, like DBC Pierre. Perhaps the most surprising novel among the five finalists was Zoë Heller's \\"What was she thinking?: Notes on a Scandal\\".<br /><br />The prize went to Pierre's \\"Vernon God Little\\" -- but I believe it got the Prize more because of marketing rather than for its literary qualities, which are virtually none. The real winner was in Heller's sophomore effort. Dealing with a complex and contemporary theme, the writer never fails to achieve high with her sharp cutting prose.<br /><br />Drawing a complex panel of loneliness and delusion, Heller created some of the most vivid characters of the contemporary literature. The best one is Barbara, the narrator. She is an elderly lady who is cares only about her life until she becomes friends with Sheba, a new teacher in the school where Barbara works.<br /><br />But Sheba also becomes a very close friend of one of her teenage students. Actually, they become lovers -- that is where the scandal is placed. Out of sheer jealousy, Barbara's acts become more and more dangerous, not only to her but also to Sheba. In a society where every dirty detail sells tabloids, the imminent scandal is set.<br /><br />Given Heller work as a columnist, she can speak of media as someone who knows it. Her insightful prose never fails to bring up the issue of what makes newspaper be sold. Readers want juicy details -- even the made-up ones. They don't care whether the story is true or not, as long as it has sex involved.<br /><br />But, the writer could easily have fallen into the trap she set -- write a book about the media. But she did not. \\"What was she thinking?: Notes on a Scandal\\" is a novel about the human condition, about life, about getting old -- and what we expect from society and what society expects from us. Heller is no moralist, she, most of the time, is a reporter, using Barbara's voice.<br /><br />The further the narrative advances, the darker the story gets. Some compared Barbara to Tom Ripley -- and they are not wrong. She is a female Ripley. For her there is no sense of being harmful to achieve what she wants. On the other hand, Sheba is also very egotistical -- and this makes her very human as well.<br /><br />In the end, there is no right, no wrong. There are only people trying to survive their complicated lives. Heller is no easy to them either. In her word people get involved in dangerous situations. And she, as the writer, doesn't make those situations any easy -- this way she can please not only the literary type of readers, but also the tabloid fans. Heller is a writer to watch.pects from us.

Paul Auster, on the other hand, says \\"words could kill (...) Words could alter reality, and therefore they were too dangerous to be entrusted to a man\\". But when \\"Oracle Night\\"'s narrator realizes so, it is too late -- he has said too many words, and his reality is a way too different.<br /><br />Still working on (or insisting on, depending where you come from) the role of the writer in the society, New Yorker writer Paul Auster has delivered one of his most engaging books in his latest \\"Oracle Night\\". Not different from most of his previous work, he focuses on a New Yorker writer, in this case, the protagonist's life will be deeply altered in the course of a week or so.<br /><br />When we first meet Sidney Orr he is leaving hospital and barely knows how the life is outside the facility. He is a writer who hasn't worked for a long time, and seems to be longing to get back to work. What will start this process is a blue Portuguese notebook that he buys in a store that belongs to a Chinese named M.R. Chang.<br /><br />From the moment Orr starts working on his blue notebook something happens -- not only to him, but to Auster's narrative as well. There is a smooth change: we start reading Orr's novel that is a retelling of a minor plot from Dashiell Hammett's \\"The Maltese Falcon\\". For some time, \\"Oracle Night\\" is a book within a book within a book. At some point, there are three distinctive narratives in one book -- and it is not difficult to follow any of them, because the three are very interesting.<br /><br />This device is nothing new -- A. S. Byatt's \\"Possession\\", Ian McEwan's \\"Atonement\\" to name a few--, but in Auster's hands it is still interesting. What fascinates most when he uses such a device is fact that he is trying to expose how (un)limited is the work of a writer. Different from 'real life' a writer can leave something unfinished. If he doesn't know what to do with his narrative he may toss his work aside and start a new one. In 'real life' there is not tossing -- one must deal with the problem.<br /><br />It is impressive that a novel about words and its powers is so thin. Auster is economic with his words, because like Orr, he knows that they can kill, alter reality --that, after all, they are too dangerous. It's been a long time since I last read a book that gave me so much pleasure -- that is why \\"Oracle Night\\" receives my highest praises and recommendations.ot tossing -- one must deal with the problem.

After all, the novel brings a summary of all the six British novelist's works at the back of the book. But that is not the point. The pleasure in the Fowler's latest lays in the simplicity of the story, with characters that are so human that hit home, the gives us a modern-day Austen.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple and that is why Fowler is so effective with what she wants to reach. Five women and a man meet every month to discuss a Jane Austen nove. The plan is to bring the British novelist back to their lives -- and her sense of humor and way of facing life as well. Needless to say, the classic novel of the month starts to influence the later day characters --this was the plan after all. This changes their lives.<br /><br />Austen has written only six novels, some short stories and an obscure and not-well-known work called \\"Lady Susan\\". Throughout the six months while the book club members read her major works, we, readers, get in touch not only with Jane Austen, but we also have a delightful idea of what she would be writing nowadays, were she a contemporary of ours.<br /><br />Fowler's focus her text on the human dynamics between the club members and their lives outside the club as well. So every month is a sort of homage to Austen. Fowler exposes the member's live --past and present-- and we learn who they turned out to be who they are.<br /><br />Like Diane Johnson's Le Divorce --which is a modern-day retelling of Henry James--, and Jane Smiley's \\"A Thousand Acres\\" --which is Shakespeare--, Fowler retold Austen with wit, charm and authority. Her words, characters and plots would make the British writer proud -- or even envious, in a good way.<br /><br />The last part of the book is a treat for any Austenite. Not only is there the summary of the book, but also Fowler made a wonderful research gathering quotations from many writers on Jane Austen.

Jones's Pulitzer Prize Winner \\"The Known World\\" is novel to enter into the literary cannon like one of the great American novels about slavery like Toni Morrison's \\"Beloved\\". The writer has managed to acquire epic proportions telling a story of intimate tone. He achieves that due to his ability to portray the role of individuals in their ethnic group and their personal fight.<br /><br />The bottom line of the narrative focus on the moral dilemma of an African-America man, ex-slave, becoming a slave owner. He, above everybody, knows the difficulties and pain of being owned by someone, however, he still feeds the same system that threatened his freedom.<br /><br />Henry Townsend was once a slave whose father bought his liberty. Once free he builds an empire, buying slaves and fields. He doesn't seem to have moral issues on that. He, his wife, family and friends lead a calm life until the day he dies. Ever since, his widow tries to keep Henry's business but she can't help the chaos.<br /><br />Although this is the main plot, the novel is fulfilled with amazing characters that are very human. Not only Henry's slaves, but also all the community of Manchester County. Jones has a stunning ability to bring characters to the novel. It may sound strange that in the 10th chapter a group of new characters pops up, but he writer has his reasons and not many pages later they will have an important function in one of the main characters plot.<br /><br />One of the best qualities of the book is the ability of Jones switch time and points of view. From one line to the other, time may fly almost 100 years back or forth. This intricate spiral of time is one of the characteristics that make \\"The Known World\\" a very demanding book.<br /><br />This constant use of anticipation only enhances the anxiety of the reader. If in the beginning the narrator tells that one the characters will escape from her owner, the readers have to wais hundreds of pages to find out how and why. This kind of device can be very discouraging in the hands of a less talented writer. However, with Jones and his beautiful language, this is only a plus to this novel.<br /><br />Like the narrator mentions, the color of the skin of the characters is reason of being doomed or not.

But what may be very surprising is how this novel is still up-to-date more than forty years after its first printing. The main reason to this evidence is that Condon's book captures with accuracy the portray of a time --however this might make a bad book dated, this characteristic makes a good book timeless. <br /> <br />In years to come, people will read \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" to see how the Cold War and Communism paranoia affected people's lives in the 50's. The tone in the novel favors the sarcasm and black humor rather than reverential attitude. Some scenes are too funny to be takes seriously and that is why the book is addictive. <br /> <br />However much stereotypical the characters may sound, they are very human in their attitudes, in their longing for power and security. Eleanor Iselin --usually called Raymond's mother, in the book-- is the character that defines `mother from hell'. If you look up in the dictionary this entry, you should find Mrs. Iselin's name there. And if one looks up for great political thriller should find \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\". <br /> <br />Some of the best passages of the book are those featuring her writing down her husband's personal black list accusing almost everyone of communism. This gives the dimension of what people may have faced in the 50s. These moments can be more disturbing than all the brainwashing part. <br /> <br />And despite the satirical nature of the story, this is one to be taken seriously. There may not be more communists or even Cold War in the World, but there will always be people crazy to have more and more power. And these are the ones to be feared, those who have nothing to lose and wouldn't hesitate in sacrifice themselves and other people for getting what they want.  <br />	2004-09-05

To begin with this is not your usual book of the month --this is a complicated narrative filled with symbols and metaphors. The main characters are an Indian boy and a Bengal tiger, hence there isn't much dialogue between them what makes the novel more difficult. And the top of the odds the main theme turns out to be God and Religion.<br /><br />So why are many readers willing to read this book? I think that because it tackles with a subject that interests everyone: existence. Telling the story of Pi, Martel managed to dive deep in the existential question that surrounds everyone. But he does that without being didactically boring --this, after all, is just a story, and this writer is a good storyteller.<br /><br />All characters --whether human or animal --are beautifully developed, and Pi's family is a joy. His father walk in the zoo with his tow sons is one of my favorite moments of this novel. However much difficult it would be for Martel to develop the animal's identity, he overcomes this `problem' giving each animal a distinguished personality of its own.<br /><br />Dealing with a complex theme like religion, Martel would have fallen into a boring speech of giving lectures about each religion. But this is not the case. The way the novel is written it gives room for explanation --without giving a lecture. The theme is dealt with easy, beauty and, above all, respect. This is bravura of a book. Not many writers would dare to write about such theme with so much confidence and courage.<br /><br />\\"Life of Pi\\" is not an easy novel -- many may feel tempted to give it up, but those who stick with it will not regret in the end. In the last pages when Pi reaches his destination, the reader fells at easy and is able to see life in another better way --not many novels have such quality.	2004-08-30

His style is unique and nobody will ever write like him. He is one of my favorite novelists ever and his \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" one of my most beloved books ever. I know there are some problems with the narrative --and there is animal cruelty that bothers me so much, but, still, this is one of the best books I have ever read.<br /><br />The feeling I had when I first read \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is impossible to compare to any other work. The vitality and joy of this story was what I liked most. Despite the fact that it is a sad story, I can feel life coming from every paragraph. The book deals with the Lost Generation, those youngsters who lost their dreams and hope with the First World War. Afterwards they were so displeased with life that their motto was \\"Live fast, die young\\".<br /><br />The pages of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" perfectly translates this momentum: every second counts, do it now, because in the future you may not be able to do again. This is the feeling that all the characters are after. The feeling of being fulfilled. However, it is not easy to find out what fulfill each person --so that is the reason why they make so many mistakes.<br /><br />At some point, Bill, one of the most joyful characters of the book, says, \\"Our stay on earth is not for long. Let us rejoice and believe and give thanks.' This perfectly summarizes the point Hemingway is trying to state. This is what he believed by the time he wrote the novel -- in the mid 20's. \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is one of the books that best show the way the writer believed people should live. All things that Hemingway liked in his life were there, like beautiful women, boxing, fishing, bullfighting and traveling through Europe. This may not be the most appropriated lifestyle for many people, but it sure worked in Europe circa 1925.<br /><br />Not many writers would be able to writer a book like that. If one thinks of the matter of the fact, \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is almost a book about nothing. However it never let the reader feel bored. The characters' lives can be boring --they are bored most of the time. But the reader is fully immersed in that universe that he feels like part of the group. It is not hard to believe that Jake, Lady Brett, Bill, Cohn and the others are not our friends. They are so exposed to us --that in the end we know more about them then themselves. In the end, we know so much about life that we could expect from a book. And Ernest Hemingway is one of the few who can do that.t never let the reader feel bored.

Something that I knew what that it couldn't be a bad book -- Roth, one of the best North American writers ever, would never write a bad novel. But from what I had read about this book people seemed to be a little uncomfortable with its thematic.<br /><br />No sooner did I read some twenty pages than I realized that in truth this one of the most misunderstood books of American Literature -- more or less a cousin of Vladimir Nabokov's \\"Lolita\\". Readers are usually too concerned with the sexual thematic that they forget or simply miss about the other subjects.<br /><br />Most of the readers are very focused on the sexual content. It may play a fair part in the development of \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\"'s narrative, but it is not the only subject. At it is root, the novel is an unusual Bildungsroman -- than kind of novel that follows the moral and physical bring up of a young man. This time we are talking about Alexander Portnoy --the man behind the myth. As the book explain there is a disorder named after him.<br /><br />For almost 300 pages, we follow the Portnoy family complicated dynamics with a control freak mother, a weak father, a nice daughter and a teenager son fueled with testosterone. The son's, Alex, stories are amazingly funny and critical. When first you laugh for what he said, in the next page you're taken aback for his critical view of family, religion and society.<br /><br />Roth is a master of portraying the young Jew's angst. Not only his main character, Portnoy, has the same problems every young man has, but he also has a Jewish mother. Part of the time the son-mother relationship is the dorsal spine of the novel. But the writer's words do beyond it.<br /><br />Since \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\" hasn't received so much kudos as \\"Lolita\\", people feel easy to say all kind of nasty and incoherent things about this novel. Many readers approach to Roth's novel already prepared to face a sexual journey of a young man -- painted with the dirties paints. They couldn't be more wrong. This is a work of extreme sensibility that not many writers would be able to write. Of course, this novel is not recommended to everyone --only for those who like good literature, with content and not only shape.<br /><br />The Vintage edition has a new afterword written by Philip Roth for the twenty-five anniversary. Not only are they illuminating but also a jewel for giving readers the chance see what the writer thinks of his novel 25 years later. And we see that Roth is still a master --even 25 years later.already prepared to face a sexual journey of a young man -- painted with the dirties paints. They couldn't be more wrong.

But little did I know that \\"Lullaby: A Novel\\" has absolutely nothing to do with that story. What surprised me more --and it was a great one --is that this writer is back in his best shape. Not since his \\"Fight Club\\" has Palahniuk written such a good book.<br /><br />All the thematic that are common in his work are present in his \\"Lullaby\\", but, this time, he is such a more mature writer that his development is much smoother and his critic to the 21st century society is sharper. That same angst that he used in \\"Club\\" is here, but, this time, it goes beyond the male hater -- more women can identify themselves with the thematic.<br /><br />The narrative tangles with many themes, but in the end, it boils down to excess of information we are force fed with. We have so many resources of information nowadays, that it is too easy to make news --how reliable is everything we read? Who should we trust? And in the end, we know so much, but do we know what to do with all this information we have received?<br /><br />Like Palahniuk says, the Big Brother is not watching us -- it is singing and dancing to entertain us and avoid people to use their minds. The African deadly poem is just a device to explore, the writer's funny --and why not?-- likely conspiracy theories. But this is not a book about conspiracy.<br /><br />\\"Lullaby\\" grabs you for the Global World appeal --or maybe spell? -- that it has. An ancient African poem kills people in the United States in the 21st century. In other words, the contemporary word has broken all time and space borders. And this time everyone can actually be Citizens of the World -- World Travelers.<br /><br />Not by chance, half of the book is a road trip. The characters, Carl, Helen, Mona and Oyster (yes, there is a man whose `name' is Oyster), are trying to run away from their pasts, their mistakes. But there is not such thing, be you at home, or on the road. Oyster has so many resonances that at some point one starts wondering if he is not a Tyler Durden is disguise --or at least they are friends.<br /><br />Fueled with angst, but above all, Palahniuk's best way of dealing with passion, \\"Lullaby\\" has so much explosive that it is more a Rock `n Roll novel, that won't let you sleep until you've reached the last sentence.ay from their pasts, their mistakes.

Trilogy	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Difficult but rewarding	To read John Dos Passos' \\"The 42ND Parallel\\" is a unique reading experience that I highly recommend, though not to everybody. It is a great book, but very intellectual, slow and sometimes confusing --therefore it requires a lot of concentration from the reader. But those who adventure this superb work are likely to be very pleased. This is a great portrait of the USA circa 1900 --a remarkable read.<br /><br />To begin with, the format of the story can be a major drawback. Not only is it segmented, but also, from time to time, sections that haven't much to do with the narrative itself pop up. Sections named \\"Newsreel\\" and \\"Camera Eye\\" may not make the main narrative --or narratives --move on, but they are important to set the mood and give historical background to the reader. They can put off the reader, or helpful, it only depends on how much one likes historical context.<br /><br />Each main character is a book itself. They have long stories that are told from the beginning. Each one has his or her main conflicts, supporting characters and so forth. But the closer we get to the end, the clearer it is that all the storylines will get together in the end. And this is one of the biggest accomplishments of Dos Passos. Many writers try to do this kind of device and fail --they are neither convincer, nor surprising. But this is not the case in \\"The 42ND Parallel\\". You may have a feeling the narratives will eventually meet each other in the end, but the end is so engaging that surprises us.<br /><br />Since \\"The 42ND Parallel\\" is the first installment of a trilogy, clearly, it has no ending so to speak. The narratives come to a finale, but still there is water to pass under the bridge. The last paragraph is the perfect hook for the next novel. It leaves the reader with a natural excitement to read \\"1919\\".	2004-08-08

I have never seen the production stage, and I knew only a few things of the story, so when I reached the middle of the narrative I was surprised because it is totally different from what I expected. And it was a great surprise.<br /><br />More than a love story, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is a gothic tale of obsession --leading to madness. The Paris Opera House and its hidden rooms, and underground are perfect place to develop a horror story. Leroux noticed this potential. His descriptions of the place are creepy and in the end we start wondering if it is not a true story indeed.<br /><br />Leroux was very smart, writing a novel like he was only reporting something --and not creating a work of fiction. Therefore there are police reports, newspapers' scraps, witness interviews. More than a narrator, the person who is telling the story is only gathering useful information for the reader.<br /><br />His characters are real human beings --even the `ghost', than throughout the narrative we realize that he is the one with most human characteristics. Sometimes, Christine is a little stereotypical, mostly when she says she wants to be `the mistress of her faith' or something like it. And so is Raoul --but that doesn't diminish the qualities of this engaging novel.<br /><br />All in all, this is a French classic that I highly recommend --however one must be patient because the narrative is a little confusing and slow sometimes, but never boring.	2004-08-08
US	49577356	R3347B9XCEVT3F	0060080841	868613530	The Stepford Wives	Books	5	5	5	N	N	More important for the ideas than the language	Ira Levin's \\"The Stepford Wives\\" is already one classic of the feminism --or the chauvinism, depending on where you come from. Written in the early 70s the novel was published when all the feminist movement --and the sexual revolution-- was still fresh, so that it allowed a reading that nowadays is a little dated, nevertheless important.<br /><br />As some have pointed, the book's strength is not the language, but the ideas. Sure it is a quick read. Levin is not worried with the creating of crafted sentences, or using difficult and obscure words --his style is very straight. The major point in \\"The Stepford Wives\\" is the story indeed: battle of genders.<br /><br />The concept of women against men is as old as the mankind, but never has it taken such a dark and creepy bend in the road. In the town of Stepford everything seems to be perfect --as if perfection is a plausible thing. Women are housewives who adore their working husbands. Joanna Eberhart and her family have just moved. Like some women of her time, she wants to have a job, and also tackle her family. Little does she know that such thing is not possible in that place. With a new friend, the spirited Bobbie, she will discover that living in Stepford is not the best place in the world.<br /><br />Playing with sci-fi and the absurdity, Levin wrote a work that is timeless. He has taken the battle of the sexes one step further. It is impossible not to laugh at some point, and be desperate at others. His plot is a metaphor with a naturalistic approach --this is hard device for a writer, but he can manage that very well. At some point --mostly in the first part of the novel --not much happens. There are pages describing Joanna's day, which, by the way, happen to be very boring. And the writer has a point with that.<br /><br />For this novel, Levin should be nominated as the undisputable king of the subtleness. Different from many contemporary writers, he creates the mood without giving too much --in this point he is precise. We always have the feeling that we should know a little more --but he leaves much room for the imagination, and it is great. Maybe one of the best disciples of Levin is Stephen King --not all the time, but he has learned a few tricks with the master.<br /><br />As I aforementioned, this is a quick book, and won't take more than two or three sittings to read, but its effect is everlasting. Just like in \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" it is impossible to be tell with precision what is really happening and what is the paranoia. Maybe everything is happening inside the protagonists' head --or not. And this is the creepiest aspect of his novels.<br /><br />The battle of the sexes and the portrait of time --plus its entertaining aspect-- make of \\"The Stepford Wives\\" a timeless book. For further enjoyment I suggest the original movie, the one staring Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss.point he is precise.

This is a good start for any book. This is the kind of reference that characterizes the contemporary novel. More than making an auto-reference, the writers opts for referring to something outside her novel --by doing that she trusts her reader, and beleives that the person who is buying the book has enough knowledge to 'decipher' the title. With her &quot;The Dogs of Babel&quot;, Carolyn Parkhurst aims in a distant target and doesn't miss her shot.<br /><br /> Not for a single second is the Babel legend mentioned in the novel --it is a knowledge you must have prior to begin the book. And if you still don't have in the end, you will be moved to learn about it. And, believe me, it totally fits the narrative.<br /><br /> The book tells the story of a linguist who decides to do the impossible: teach his dog to speak. In his mind he has a good reason. The dog is the only witness of the fall from an apple tree that killed his wife. What is consuming him is the fact he does not know whether that falls was an accident or a suicide. He has reasons to believe in the second option.<br /><br /> Alternating between past and present, the story of Paul and his wife Lexy is unfolded and we learn that despite the true love, there were mental issues consuming her. The more we read the more plausible is the suicide.<br /><br /> With the tone that is melancholic from the beginning, Parkhurst tells the story with a man struggling to survive --find a reason to keep up, when there is nothing left for him. The narrator has to deal with the grief, and doesn't know how to. The wish of making the dog learn to speak is at the same time his way of accepting his wife is gone. If on one hand he wants the dog to 'tell the truth', on the other, once the truth is told, there will not be much left of his wife, but his memories.<br /><br /> Indeed Parkhusrt's premise is original and poignant. Her option on telling the story may sound na?ve at some parts, but that is how she chose to make her point. Alongside with Audrey Niffenegger's &quot;The Time Traveler's Wife&quot; and Mark Haddon's &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time&quot;, &quot;The Dogs of Babel&quot; makes the trilogy of the mental instability. Each of them has its flaws, but more qualities than problems. Another thing, the paperback edition cover is very beautiful.a?ve at some parts, but that is how she chose to make her point.

Not because the books are similar, but I think they bear much resemblance. Both novels are narrated by a character that is one of the protagonists of the love affair, and, in both cases, he is very sad and jealous.<br /><br />If \\"The end of the Affair\\" is a \\"diary of hate\\", \\"The Good Soldier\\" is \\"the saddest story [the narrator] ever heard\\", is what John Dowel tells in the beginning of the book. Set in a period from 1904 to 1913, the narrative tells the story of two couples -- one American and another one British --that meet in Germany and become friends. Some time later, Dowel discoveries that his wife had a love affair with his friend.<br /><br />This novel is considered a Pre-Modernist work, Ford wrote the book in 1914, immediate before the First World War started --however, the book has some modernists elements, like a break from the Edwardian and Victorian novels, more traditional novels that preceded it. Ford employs innovations: the plot is disjointed, non-chronological, and infused with reflective commentary from the narrator.<br /><br />The feeling we have is that we are unveiling the story at the same time of Dowel. He never seems to know more than we do. His tone of narrative is, above all, confuse and angry, but sometimes he is also very naïve. But, at the end, what is left is the impression that he is/was a man seeking for the truth, for some console, and coming to terms with his wife betrayal.<br /><br />Although it is a novel that discusses the moral of the adultery, \\"The Good Soldier\\" is not a book that preaches any kind of moral.  Sometimes, the major theme in this book is the difference between reality and appearance.<br /><br />Many consider \\"The Good Soldier\\" the best book of the pre-war period, mostly because of the issues it touched upon. By that time, the so-called polite society didn't use to mention subjects like adultery, betrayal and moral confusion. Today we may be tired of discussing these issues, but they still make an interesting book.e society didn't use to mention subjects like adultery, betrayal and moral confusion.

At its root one can find the original and common boy-meets-girl-boy-looses-girl-and-they-get-together-again kind of story, but it is told with such an exquisiteness and witty --not to mention the mind-bending plot-- that even those who don't like it can't stop after a few pages and say `wow'.<br />At this point the plot is widely known. A man with a genetic disorder keeps traveling in time, while his better half takes the normal course of life. Eventually they meet every other time and develop a deeply passionate love affair. Add to this intriguing premise two narrators, Clare and Henry, with powerful voices to take the reader the deepest in their beautiful story.<br />At the surface, \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" is a love story with sci-fi twists, but in another level it has philosophic inquires. The mainly one couldn't be more existentialist: what are we doing here? Where are from? Where are we heading towards? Henry's travels don't provide answers --on the contrary, only bring up more questions. And the more he wonders, so do readers. This is the kind of device that many authors nowadays are not able to provide to their novels.<br />Once, when Clare is a teenager and Henry is his mid-thirties they are chatting about his condition, and he brings up Kierkegarard and Heidegger, but Nietzsche and his eternal return are much more suitable to this unconventional love tale. The narrative goes in a circular way. An event that was mentioned in the beginning pops up in its full hundred pages later. And Niffenegger still manages to keep her readers following this complicated and complex spiral in time, following Henry's life, waiting for more explanation --or a scene from another point of view. He says \\"things get kind of circular, when you're me\\".<br />Using such device, this novel can make a strong connection to Milan Kundera's masterpiece \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\". Sure Niffenegger is not Kundera, but she stands in her own merits showing how time can bring people together and then set them apart. Not by chance, \\"Lightness\\" begins quoting Nietzsche and telling that all the events are `kept alive' in the past, things happen over and over. Like Henry watching things over and over --and trying to accept them, and says \\"always again, always the same\\". Being only a passive being makes him impotent, and he's not able to change things. Maybe a invisible force is in charge, or just this is the way life is.<br />Another strong literary reference in this novel is A.S. Byatt's masterpiece \\"Possession\\". Not because Niffenegger quotes it a couple of times, but because the two novels talk about the same thing: the consequences of the influence of time and love in the lives of two people.<br />Not by chance also is Henry a librarian, who is devoted to books. Being immersed in a book is traveling through space and time. Literature --and many other arts and sciences --takes us to places that we'll never be able to go, be that in the future, in the past, or even in another dimension. Henry's life is, therefore, a beautiful metaphor of the power of reading and creating art.<br />Niffenegger is a plastic artist --more or less like Clare-- and that's why her narrative has so much visual appeal. She has a gift for describing the outside of her characters --and the inside as well. But it is her colors and shapes that immerse the reader in the hurricane of mixed feelings that are consuming people. \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" is also very cinematic. Rarely does a novel have the concept of cutting and juxtaposition --like in a movie-- so clearly and effectively. A rare achievement.<br />One of Henry's wisest advices for Clare is \\"love the world and yourself in it\\". And this coming from someone who has such a special gift --or burden, depends on where you come from-- means a lot. With such beautifully crafted sentences, characters and plot, Audrey Niffenegger is one writer to watch.crafted sentences, characters and plot, Audrey Niffenegger is one writer to watch.	2004-07-09

This is when some people think that you don't live one day more --but you have one day less. This is sad and depressive, but this is the tone that John Updike, one of the best American writers ever, chooses to conclude the third installment in his Rabbit quartet.<br />Keeping up the same level of the two previous Rabbit novels, \\"Rabbit is Rich\\" was deservedly awarded with Pulitzer Prize, American Book Award and National Book Critics Circle Award. Not bad for a novel about man who has a sort of Peter Pan syndrome and he's afraid of growing up --although this is not this clear stated in any novel. In the very beginning the narrative meditates on the fear of death, and from page one on, we can realize that there is no place to go but down.<br />Rabbit, his family, friends and enemies are back more or less ten years after the events depicted in the previous book. Not only is he older, but also he is wiser and bitter. He's living with his mother in law, and running the car lot that his father in law left. His son Nelson is at college, but sooner will be back --and so will problems.<br />In this novel, Nelson has a major role too. He is becoming sort of a Rabbit Jr. --his fears, mistakes, anxieties are more or less the same his father had. Generation after generation, people are still the same --we're the same kind of `animals' after all. And Harry Rabbit Angstrom can't do much to change his son --that hates him because of Jill's death. Incapable of any kind of communication, the two can only drift apart, hoping that time can heal the pain.<br />Updike keeps the detailed examination of the sexual moral of the middle class. After a close look at the 50's and 60's sexual conduct, the author turns his magnifying glass to couples in the late 70's. This was when marriages were suffering the consequences of the sexual revolution, and an enormous boredom is replacing the joy of the discovery of a new sexuality in the previous decade. These were also the time of high consumerism. Rabbit is obsessed with a magazine called \\"Consumer Reports\\". It seems that the whole country is in a time of prosperity and people can spend as much as they want --but it will have consequences in the end.<br />It is not a fluke that Updike writes great prose. His text is full of wit and imagination --but what I like best is how accurate he can portray that society that is falling apart. His sharp dialogues are pitch perfect, and the cynicism is only a plus in the narrative.<br />Like Charlie --Rabbit's coworker and friend, and his wife's ex-lover-- once said: \\"That was the good old days.

And Richard Russo is not afraid of that in his \\"Empire Falls\\". However much it is sad, the situation that turns out in one of the climaxes of the novel is very plausible and can happen --actually has happened a couple in any place.<br />To tell the story of a small town ruining after the close of a local big factory that employed most of the city's inhabitants, Russo uses not only sociology and psychology, but also a big dose of economy. Yes, these three sciences are of much help to the talented writer proves that the economical decline results in a moral one --or vice-versa.<br />The lives of his characters are only the reflection of their city's life. Everything is slowly falling into pieces --literally and metaphorically. And as one might expect, from all this fall, a hero would rise, but, like in real life, there are no heroes, only a group of devastated souls trying to survive, but suffering in their personal lives the consequences of an economic decline of their city -- this is the beginning of the end of their prosperity, in other words, of the world as they know.<br />Mr. Russo's writing is clear as crystal. There are useless words; his prose is straight --as his characters. Not only has he written a novel with a great plot, but also with unforgettable -- and some lovable-- characters. Dramatic as it would be, the writer still finds a lot of room for a laugh and lots of irony. Like most great novels, \\"Empire Falls\\" transcends any label, and becomes an universal book --which is more than most readers bargain for.<br />Awarding Richard Russo with the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2002 was not a fluke. His novel has qualities and ambitions that make it one of the best in the 21st Century. I have no doubts that in the future people will regard \\"Empire Falls\\" as a classic.	2004-07-04

In this book the couple of editors gave more attention to the size of the texts rather than its content. While on one hand it is an interesting attempt, on the other is to reductionism to pick great writers' works only because of its size.<br />There are stories from writers everywhere, some very very famous, others not so much, but all texts are no longer than ten pages, some are really short. Using such device, the editors managed to get an interesting sample of every writer -- which may tease the reader to search for more long and complex texts from an author s/he liked.<br />Like Mr. Howe states in the introduction, \\"the usual short stories cannot have a complex plot\\". And this is the rule for the selected texts in this volume. However it doesn't mean that the shorts are simplistic or even easy. Some of them, like Jorge Luis Borges's, Joyce's, Tolstoy's, Guimarães Rosa's among others are more complex and difficult to read than a whole novel by another writer.<br />But while we have great texts to discover, there are also some flops --or minor works from great writers -- that are grouped in this book only to make the book longer --at least this was the feeling I got after reading all of them. Not that this strategy is a problem, but not all the shorts keep up the same high level.<br />All in all, this is a good beginning to find `new' writers, to discover styles and to see how one great author can gamble with the size and format of his/her text --and most of them still win.

Not many things are comparable to the big gasp that even an experienced reader will utter when he/she read that paragraph, and in disbelief wants to move on.<br />Waters' extraordinary novel is made of that, of a big hanging twist after another -- and we are desperate for more. When the narrative flows in a calm pace we cannot almost believe that `nothing is going on'. Actually a lot is going on all the time, but we keep waiting for a huge twist happen. And they happen --oh, boy!<br />The story of two crossed orphans is told with sophistication and passion. There is more passion from the author towards her creations than from one character to each other. The characters are never what they seem to be --and, no matter how experienced we are, we are delightfully fooled most of the time.<br />Victorian par excellence, \\"Fingersmith\\" can be compared to the also beautiful \\"The Crimson Petal and the White\\". Both are very plot-driven big bravura of novels. Waters's work may not be as big as \\"Petal\\" but it is still an important social panorama of a period in England --the time when women used to `farm' babies for whatever they were required, a time when pickpockets were called fingersmith, among other things.<br />But Waters is usually compared to Charles Dickens. It is undeniable that there is a Dickensian element in her novel -- it is not by chance that in the very first page of \\"Fingersmith\\" the main character goes to theater to see \\"Oliver Twist\\". But while in Dickens' novels characters could be divided into the good, the bad and the very very evil, in Waters's book they cannot labelled at all. Nobody is only good or only bad --they are closer to real human beings, in whom both good and evil cohabit and eventually one of them will come to the surface.<br />At some point, \\"Fingersmith\\" is very close to the gothic novel. Waters has an incredible ability to describe phantasmagoric places without even mentioning ghosts. She creates alive human beings that are much more scarier than any dead soul --just check the beginning of the third part.<br />But there is also room for existentialism in \\"Fingersmith\\". At some point, the narrative would raise interesting questions on the sanity issue. What's a mad person? How can we label someone crazy? There probably is some resonance from Charlotte Brontë's \\"Jane Eyre\\". And the philosophical discussion never stops. The most important thematic in \\"Fingersmith\\" is the identity: what defines who you are? This is a topic that will always be timeless.<br />All in all, this is a novel with so many good influences and references that only enhances the pleasure of reading it. There are so many layers in Waters's \\"Fingersmith\\" that it is a delightful game to try and predict what will come next --but, mind you, nobody has a creative mind as this author.ability to describe phantasmagoric places without even mentioning ghosts.

US	49577356	RJ7O1ZMP3RHG9	0684852225	55789944	Close Range : Wyoming Stories	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Family ties and ranching make it very Close	After reading a couple of stories of Annie Proulx's collection \\"Close Range: Wyoming Stories\\" I started feeling the line that kept the narrative together was the familiar feeling. But near the end, when I reached a tale called \\"The Governors of Wyoming\\", I realized that they are also about ranching.<br />At a point in this very same story, a character states that \\"the main thing about ranching (...), last as long as you can, make things come out so's it's still your ranch when it is time to get buried. That's my take on it\\". This statement is clear what keeps all the stories together in this collection. In a way, or another, the main characters --and the main plot of narrative-- are dealing with forces --be them another person, destiny etc-- that are trying to steal their ranch.<br />However, the family ties are another acting force --that may help to keep the ranch or lose it. There are always conflicts between siblings, husband and wives, mothers and sons. And another major theme is the intolerance that is all around us most of the time.<br />This theme is the main object in the last --and probably the best --story, called \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" that narrates the relationship between to male cowboys that fall in love with each other. Due to their inhospitable environment their affair is fated to surrender. But if this is not a surprise, the dignity and beauty with Proulx deals with the characters that is an amazing thing.<br />The stories have different objectives and paces. Take \\"Job History\\" for instance. It is so fast that sometimes looks like a newsreel. And so it could be, because it is the story of members of a family that are so busy with their own lives that they end up missing the history that is happening in their times. And it --history -- is interfering in their lives more than they realize or wanted to. Contrary to \\"Mountain\\" this is a very fast narrative.<br />Each story has its own appeal and is dealt in a different way. \\"The Bunchgrass Edge of the World\\" stars like a regular one, but when its touches of surrealism begins, it becomes something very unusual, and one of the best of the collection.<br />Much more accessible than Proulx's Pulitzer and National Book Prize winner \\"The Shipping News\\", \\"Close Range: Wyoming Stories\\" is a real treat to readers who like a sophisticated prose, written with heart, soul and smartness. It reads like Cormac McCarthy's best.<br />Like most anthologies it is not easy to keep a high level all the time --but the writer succeeds most of the time. Of course, there are stories that I like better than other ones, but, as whole, I think the book is so good that it is impossible not to give it my highest recommendations.rld\\" stars like a regular one, but when its touches of surrealism begins, it becomes something very unusual, and one of the best of the collection. <br />Much more accessible than Proulx's Pulitzer and National Book Prize winner \\"The Shipping News\\", \\"Close Range: Wyoming Stories\\" is a real treat to readers who like a sophisticated prose, written with heart, soul and smartness.

Explosive as it is, this novel is a mix of revengeful Jews and Catholic priests who protected a nazi officer. All that written in razor sharp prose could turned out in a big mess, but in these talented writer's hands is an unpudownable thriller with some philosophical and ethical issues. One seminal sentence is stated near the end of the novel but it defines all the story is about. \\"Murder is much more of a selling item than old wartime tales\\".<br />Pierre Brossard is a man on the run for almost fifty years. What he lives cannot be called a life any longer, but a big wartime lie. He was a nazi officer, accused of killing fourteen Jews. Since the end of the War he has found help and been hidden by Catholic priests. He's got away with for all this time.<br />However, now, he's been chased. A group of Jews are looking for revenge and contract an assassin to kill Brossard. At the same time, the French government and military are trying to find Brossard before, not to protect him, but to give him the trial and punishment he deserves.<br />Using three different sequence of narrative --Brossard, the assassin and the military-- Moore's novel is developed in a crescendo until its end. This may not be a big surprise, but they way the writer develops the story until it is reached is a big bravura.<br />Above all, \\"The Statement\\" is the portray of the personification of the evil. While Brossard may look like a nice old gentleman, he has no second thoughts when it comes to killing to protect his past and life and lie. Moore has created such a convincing character that the readers have no ethical issues when thinking of Brossard --he was evil, and deserves to be punished, but, it is up to each reader to decide which punishment the ex-officer deserves.<br />The cast of supporting characters may seem a little flat, but that's the way they are required for this novel. Would we follow their lives `outside' the main plot, this would disturb the sequence of the story. There is no much interest in who they are outside Brossard's story.<br />I liked this thriller a lot. I think it is well written and tackles in a respective way with serious issues that many writers will never feel comfortable enough to write about. The `omission' of the Catholic Church in the Holocaust is a subject that has started being explored with the much deserves seriousness by the literature and cinema only in the recent years. For further information, check Costa-Gavra's \\"Amen\\".<br />The subject is real and serious, and when one comes to think of that it really may have happened \\"The Statement\\" reaches another level, and almost becomes a horror book.

To begin with, there is no gore in the book --the moments of horror are so subtle, but they get under one skin.<br />\\"The Turn of the Screw\\" was first published as a serialized novel in Collier's Weekly. After that it was published in the novel format, both in England and USA. When James wrote this novella was a period of increase of the popularity of spiritual issues. Many people were searching for new ways of explaining death, and they were also loosing their Christian faith. Many were trying to communicate with the Other Side.<br />But the dead in the novella, as James once stated, are not ghosts, as we know them. However, this belief persisted through time, and even today, most readers assume that Peter Quint and Miss Jessel are spectrums or a so-called entity.<br />On the form, \\"The Turn of the Screw\\" has some innovations. Prior to James, most novels were written through one point of view --this narrator told the story and the characters and actions are under his/her way of viewing, judgments, and conclusions. On the other hand, most of James's novels count with a difference: the narrator/character is not aware of everything. In this particular novella, we see the story through the eyes of governess and we know as little as she. Not only she, but also we, has a limited knowledge of the events.<br />Much can be concluded from the story --it is impossible to have a definitive conclusion. Some say the governess was a good character fighting against evil to protect the two children. But some scholars have researched and concluded that, as a matter of fact, the governess had a troubled mind. In 1934, Edmund Wilson wrote an essay that has become one of the most influential works on Henry James's ambiguity. Based on Freudian theory, Wilson argues that the governess's sexual repression leads her to neurotically imagine and interpret ghosts.<br />However, postmodernism have led critics to a different conclusion, which adds the two main chains of sturdy of \\"The Turn of the Screw\\". Not only are the ghosts in the novel, but the governess can also be mad. For these scholars, every incident can be interpreted as to prove that the governess is mad and to prove that there are ghosts. This irresolvable controversy makes James's work so brilliant and timeless.<br />Now it is up to each reader to find his/her own ghosts in this brilliant novella --so short and so deep and complex. Contemporary readers may be stunned and still scared with the smartness of the text. As the first narrator introduces the text, he says in the first line \\"the story had held us\\", \\"The Turn of the Screw\\" will hold every sophisticated reader in his/her seat.However, postmodernism have led critics to a different conclusion, which adds the two main chains of sturdy of \\"The Turn of the Screw\\".

US	49577356	R2ZB49LSPM4RSF	0671510053	357229344	The Shipping News	Books	5	5	8	N	N	Difficult at first, but good News after all	E. Annie Proulx's \\"The Shipping News\\" is a great novel. However, it is not recommended to everybody. It sounds like a paradox, but it is true. To begin with, it is not an easy read. It takes time and patience, but it is worthwhile. The action is very slow and interior, besides much happens outside the characters, the main action is with their feelings and what goes inside their minds and hearts. Thus this is not the kind of novel that appeals to those used to fast and easy books. Moreover, this is a very intellectual material and requires a lot of references and thinking from the reader.<br />Quoyle is a thirty-six years old who has devoted his life to his wife and children. He hasn't accomplished much, but he's fine with what they have. However his wife is not happy with this life. She sells their daughters and while is running away she dies. This is falls like a bomb in Quoyle's life --disturbing his peaceful routine.<br />In order to restore the peace, he moves to his ancestors' house in an isolated and cold town. There, along with his aunt, he intends to bring his life back to place. With a new job and meeting an interesting widow, Quoyle realizes that life is good, but he still has some ghosts from the past haunting him.<br />\\"The Shipping News\\" is a novel fulfilled with metaphors. Everything has more than its first meaning. Quoyle is not only the name of the protagonist, but also something related to ships --and it will be through the shipping news that our protagonist will find his place in the world.<br />Another thing is a special touch in the novel is the quotes from \\"The Ashley Book of Knots', written by Clifford W. Ashley, or from \\"The Mariner's Dictionary\\". They are nice and give the insights on what the chapter will be about --another device related to the use of metaphors--, plus there are illustration of these knots which are very well done and even cute.<br />The movie version, directed by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m is a great and underrated film. More than being faithful to the novel, it makes justice to the spirit of the story. It is perfect to take the audience into Quoyle's world. Both movie and book are highly recommended, but only to specific audiences. My suggestion is, if you want to read the book the effort is worthwhile --it is diffcult, but reawarding--, however if you feel this is not the book for you, do not force yourself to read it.being faithful to the novel, it makes justice to the spirit of the story.

What is stated is something that will be dealt with throughout the whole novel, but the question cannot be answered right away. However the answer will be a huge `yes' once you have finished the novel.<br />The first line of the novel reads \\"We were the Mulvaneys, remember us?\\" By beginning with such device, Oates, skilled as she is, immediately immerses he reader in the in that family's universe. The voice of her narrator is so powerful, that from the beginning one may be afraid of saying no. This narrator is the youngest Mulvaney, Judd, who sees his family falling apart after the so-called rape of his sister. However young he is, he has such a sense of persuasion that we almost take for granted what he says.<br />However, as the plot unfolds, one notices that he is still a child and is trying to cope with the destruction of the institution in which he trusted, which is his family. As lost as he is, he seeks for help from every member, but everyone is so immersed in his/her own problems that the boy finds no comfort.<br />In her faulkneresk novel, Oates shows the importance of the ties that bound us together with our parents and siblings. Her plots resonates one of the best novels written in English, \\"The Sound and the Fury\\", and, although she may have been inspired by Faulkner, she still has her own talent and approach. And these qualities are what make this novel so strong and unique.<br />There is no doubt that Oates is one of the best writers of her generation. She has a special eye for society --and what backs it up, i.e. family-- that is changing. And with \\"We were the Mulvaneys\\" she discusses pertinent subjects. Society is changing because of families --or the other way round? This is not an easy question to answer, and the novel doesn't try to. What Oates does with her powerful writing is to point out that things are changing and we can only accept it --or not.-or not.	2004-06-12

To begin with, I wasn't sure that Mark Haddon's \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" was the kind of book I like to read. But after seeing writers that I like, such as Ian McEwan, A.S. Byatt and Anne Tyler, recommending this book, I stopped having second thoughts and set my sights on reading this novel. Little did I know that I would fall for it after reading a couple of pages.<br />Haddon writes as someone who knows his subject. But what make his narrative so fascinating are the options he makes as a writer. Any less talented author could make a novel with an autistic protagonist an useless tearjerker, but he avoids these pitfalls and delivers a clear prose, told with heart, but above all, with smartness.<br />What is more impressive is that, not for a second, words like autism, autistic, disabled or any other such is mentioned. And by using this device the author simply makes the reader forget about Christopher's condition -- sure he has problems, but who hasn't? This boy is so well described and developed that it is hard to forget that his voice keeps with the reader long after he/she has finished the novel. This quality reminds me of Harper Lee's \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\"'s protagonist.<br />Sure the plot is not strong. But it is not a problem; after all, \\"The Curious Incident...\\" is more a character study than a plot-driven novel. When in the middle of the narrative we find out who killed the dog, it is not important anymore, because one is so impressed with Christopher and his surroundings that the plot is in the second plan. And, at this point, the narrative has reached another conflict that will keep you going. The graphics, drawing, pictures are a plus that only enhances the experience of reading this novel.<br />The major achievement in Haddon's book is to show a down-to-earth family trying to cope with its child condition. Besides this, there is another interesting thing about this book. The writer takes inside of Christopher's brain. Giving voice to such an `underdog', it brings humanity and dignity to him. It only proves that he is like everyone else --just a little bit different.<br />Christopher may not know and understand jokes, but he `wrote' a funny and touching book --without being sappy. Only time will tell if  \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" will be part of the literary canon, but, for the time being, it is an excellent and interesting novel, deserving all the kudos it has received.ng voice to such an `underdog', it brings humanity and dignity to him.

Since I like Bradbury's work a lot this friend lent this Bradbury anthology.<br />Bradbury's science fiction is not for everyone. Some readers may find his work too philosophical and sometimes hard. And these qualities are what I like best in his writings. The anthology \\"Dinosaur Tales\\" is a good example of some themes that he tackles with in his short stories and novels. And, in this book specifically there is a big plus, the illustrations made by some of the best illustrators in the world.<br />My favorite tale in the book --and probably the best and most famous-- is \\"A Sound of Thunder\\". This tells the story of a safari to the future of a group of people who will hunt dinosaurs, book something wrong happens. It is short, more or less 30 pages, but it is so profound and well written, and that is very moving and even scary if we come to think that it can be true some day. Moreover, it rises so many questions that it is a wonderful tale to read in a group and discuss afterwards. By the way, the line I used in the title refers to this story.<br />The other tales are quite good too, and also there are two poems that are great. But, like I aforementioned, one of the big plus of this edition are the illustrations made by Moebius, Jim Steranko, William Stout, Kenneth Smith, David Wiesner, Overton Lloyd and Gaham Wilson. All of them have many credits as illustrators and their drawings are unique, and give Bradbury's tales the real dimension of their narratives. In the poem \\"Lo, the Dear Daft Dinosaurs!\\" Lloyd's illustration are kind of dream-like abstract, showing a beautiful ballet.<br />This anthology is a great way of discovering Bradbury's narratives. And since dinosaurs are such a fascinating theme for youngsters, this book comes highly recommended to young readers.	2004-06-05

Nevertheless, it perfectly fits the protagonist. In this second installment of the tetralogy, everybody's favorite rabbit is back in full glory, well, sort of.<br />The sixties have arrived and it caught Rabbit and his family by surprise. There is a brand new moral being followed, and he, as good as any product of his time, is caught by it, in spite of still being very attached to the fifties' way of thinking. But everything is about to change. Janice, Rabbit's wife, leaves him for a Greek colleague, and his mother is sick and dying. To make matters worse, the protagonist takes a young girl to live with him --and replace his wife--, while his mind is clouded with the troubles of his time, like Vietnam War and the man landing on the Moon.<br />But Rabbit's reeducation is about to begin. His new girlfriend brings along an African-American --but, of course, by that time nobody used this word-- called Skeeter who has some very extreme point of views. Actually most of what he thinks --if not everything -- is totally opposed to Rabbit's believes. Living in a constant fight these two men interact in such a way that will change both of them forever.<br />\\"Rabbit Redux\\" --just like the previous \\"Rabbit, Run\\"-- is more than a novel about the education of a man. Actually it is like a huge painting about North America in that period. Full of pop culture references -- early in the Rabbit family goes to the cinema to see \\"2001 - An Spacey Odyssey\\", for instance-- the book shows the environment in which the sexual revolution spread in USA, among other things. It is interesting to see how Rabbit's beliefs are so wrong and how they change throughout the narrative.<br />Just like in the first novel, John Updike is a gifted writer. Not only has he talent for developing characters in plausible situations, but he can also write sharp razor and witty dialogues. The words come to life from the paper when his creations are dialoguing. Another highlight of his writing is the eye he has for the times of change. The sixties were as crazy as he portrays in \\"Rabbit Redux\\". Those were time of radical change and the have a strong reflection in the Angstroms' lives.<br />I believe that Updike's work shares some resemblances with Philip Roth's. Both are important critics of North American society, but if for the second the society transforms the family institution, for the first the family is a reflection of its times and social transformation. And these two different approaches are very interesting, and can only increase the reader's critical sense.<br />All in all, Rabbit will again return in glory in the upcoming two novels, \\"Rabbit is Rich\\" and \\"Rabbit at Rest\\".

However, the three novels have some resonance, this novel stands on its own.<br />Using the decadency of a wealthy family, Lampedusa created a beautiful metaphor for his country. The sentence that perfectly describes the spirit of this novel is \\"Things must change if they are to remain the same\\". But throughout our reading, one realizes that things changed, and didn't remain the same.<br />One of the highlights of the writer's style is the description. From the beginning the narrative is filled with beautiful descriptions of places, people and food. When a garden is described with abundance of details it feels like where are there with The Prince and his dog Bendic&ograve;. But, my favorite segment is the one after the first dinner, when a pudding is served. It feels like we can taste that dessert. And not for a second these profound descriptions are boring or take a detour from the narrative.<br />The characters are also fully developed and presented. From The Prince himself to his dog Bendic&ograve; --a lovely character, by the way-- were come across real people that live, and not act. And this is more than we can ask to a novel. People like Trancredi and Angelica come alive when the writer unfolds a story that lasts 50 years.<br />For its political and novelistic achievement, Lampedusa's \\"The Leopard\\" is regarded as one of the best books of the 20 Century. And it totally deserves its praise. A novel that won't be easily forgotten by who read it. A classic for the eternity.<br />There is also beautiful film version of this novel, made by Lucchino Visconti in 1963. Both are highly recommended as means of entertainment and culture.	2004-05-23

But, unfortunately, most of them are never able to fulfill it. So, it is a great pleasure to come across a book like Matthew Pearl's \\"The Dante Club\\". This novel is everything that it had promised and little bit more.<br />At this point, the plot is widely known. In 1865, a group of Bostonian scholars is translating Dante's masterpiece. While they are dealing with \\"Inferno\\" (Hell) a murderer is executing people based on the most terrifying scenes of this poem. This not only endangers lives, but also jeopardizes the translation itself.<br />Mixing real personalities and fictional characters, the writer creates a novel that if is not real, could have really happened. It is clear that Pearl has an eye for the macabre and it is very effective for this novel. He also makes a literary analyzes of Dante and the process of translation. Not a boring and inaccessible thing, but with his text he brings to light questions that many translators might have had --not only when it comes to Dante.<br />The process of humanization of historical figures works more than fine. They way they behave and think are quite real, and it is almost impossible to think that those events never happened. And, as Pearl states in an interview in the book, it is not required to be familiar with Dante's work. But, I think that those who don't know the Italian poem will feel very likely to read it --at least its \\"Inferno\\".<br />Thinking of \\"The Dante Club\\" comes to my mind another bestseller, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". But while Dan Brown's novels lacks character development and profundity in the situations, Pearl has succeeded in creating a thriller that is bloody good, with believable characters and beautifully written. It also reminded me of Calleb Carr's \\"The Alienist\\", but, again, I think that \\"Dante\\" is much better. It is a winner.	2004-05-23

Somerset Maugham's \\"Of Human Bondage\\" follows a very well known tradition in the western literature. The same one that Charles Dickens's \\"Oliver Twist\\", among others, belong to. These kinds of novels are known as Bildunsroman, i.e. a novel that tells the story of the education of a young man. In \\"Bondage\\" we can follow Philip Carey's personal journey through life in order to achieve full development as a man.<br />In this novel, known as Maugham's masterpiece, the narrative only focus on Carey's life, and although it is not told in first person --Carey's POV-- it feels like, because all we learn is through his personal experience and conclusions. Moreover, he is virtually in every scene in the book. And because it is the story of one's life, not every incident that happens has an importance in the narrative course. Many things only happen because they do, like in real life, there is no much sense or connection with the events that happen everyday. In this sense, this can be a hard reading for some. Many may complain that --mostly the childhood and adolescence's facts --have not much to do with the end of the novel. But of course they do, after all, every thing counted to make of Carey a man.<br />And while the first half is quite slow, once Philip is a young man and meets a waitress name Mildred, who has `green skin', not only does the narrative speed up, but it also heats up. The youngster develops such an obsession for this girl that it will consume his existence. Once dealing with this issue, Mangham made his novel very ahead of its time. The sexual obsession, however never explicit, was a very modern theme for his time. And it is funny to think of how contradictory the writer was. He was able to deal with such modern themes, but opted for using a very old formula to write his book.<br />Moreover, \\"Of Human Bondage\\" has more to do with Maugham's real life, than one might think. Although he wrote two autobiographies, it turns out that his fiction with biographical touches is famous nowadays, and not those books. And, while he touches upon controversial issues, like religion, politics, arts, public health, he does not take sides.<br />The Ban Tan edition features an Introduction written by novelist Jane Smiley, and while it is very insightful, with many information, I suggest reading it once finishing the novel. She gives away many important points of the plot and it may spoil the experience of reading this book.<br />\\"Of Human Bondage\\" is an excellent book, but it may be a little difficult for readers used to contemporary, fast and easy narratives. This novel takes time and needs concentration, but it is a great experience once one is able to adapt him/herself to Maugham's velocity, and that's what makes this book so unique.phical touches is famous nowadays, and not those books.

Knowing the meti&eacute; that she's writing about, the writer is able to develop a dreamy atmosphere where everything is possible. And that's why nothing seems gratuitous.<br />Besides this talent, Tartt has an ability to full develop her characters. Not one of them seems to be inhuman or fake. Actually every one really seems to have a soul and a heart beating in their chests. The group of students alone is subject for many theses, with each one bearing a meaning and a concept.<br />\\"The Secret History\\" is not the average thriller. It is far above it. Mixing the whodunit concept with high doses of Greek culture --mostly philosophy-- Tartt wrote an intellectual novel that really works. It is far beyond your crime driven novel, \\"History\\" stands a new patter, that some has been --and will -- try to copy and failed --mostly because the writer here is impossible to copy. She has a particular style, which switches from beauty to horror and vice versa in the change of paragraph.<br />\\"The Secret History\\" may not please everyone --many may find Tartt's prose is pretentious or something -- but the truth is it is beauty and certainly there is a segment of readers that don't mind a little style and philosophy in their `thrillers'.	2004-05-09

Both talk about the cold feet that husband and wives have after a period of being married. This is not the only thing they share in common, they are both brilliant. Using a polished and beautiful prose, Updike wrote a novel that grabs you by your rabbit ears and never let you go. You don't have to be a young male American to feel related to Rabbit's life. I believe that most people go through his very same issues sooner or later in one's life.<br />Sure Rabbit is selfish --who isn't? -- but his motivations are his fears, rather than his egotistical feelings. His fear of failing as a father, a son, a husband, actually, as a human being is what makes him move from one point to another; to change things is his life. His unhappy marriage, his dead-end job are just symptoms of a bigger disease, and in this angst that lies the central spine of this splendid novel.<br />At the beginning of the narrative when Rabbit is thinking of going somewhere --he's not sure where -- far from his family, he ask for directions in a gas station. The attendant, an old man, simply says: \\"Figure out where you are going before you go there.\\" And, while Rabbit keeps that in mind, he fails to follow this advice. The fact that he goes through the motions in his life --he never seems to do anything with passion -- only proves that, like most youngsters, he is still trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life. This is one of the biggest qualities of this novel, to portray someone's life so full of truth.<br />Updike writes with his heart and his brain, making a colorful prose and characters so believable that you don't want them to go when the book is over. Every character is believable, the wife, the parents, the in-laws. I think his idea has worked so well, that he expanded that in his more books, creating The Rabbit Tetralogy. \\"Rabbit, Run\\" is highly recommended to those who like literary and good books. And now, I'm looking forward to reading the sequels.bbit, Run\\" is highly recommended to those who like literary and good books. And now, I'm looking forward to reading the sequels.	2004-04-29

It is hard to choose which one is the best, because they are both so good. In this new adventure of his best character Philip Marlowe there are many more adventures, thrills and mysteries than in the first novel.<br />In this second step of the noir literature, Chandler has built up and developed his style and characters, so he spends no time with that. The novel begins with plain action, and it takes only a few pages for the writer to set the main mystery of this narrative. Once it is done, he has all time in the world to make the weirdest people cross Marlow's path.<br />Like in the previous book, the prose is dry, there aren't many descriptions --only of some characters, but nothing that evocative-- and it is not a bad thing. by using such a device Chandler is able to write non-stop action making the main plot more and more intrincated, until its solution. A great book, highly recommended to readers who like mistery novels of high quality and beautiful prose.	2004-04-25

The boy --who also is the narrator-- doesn't like the clown thing, but on one crucial Sunday he'll find out what's behind his father-clown. In a story that involves war, survivor, betrayal and love the truth is unfold.<br />With a fast prose, the book doesn't require more than a few hours to be read. But the feeling it leaves is timeless. We have read and seen in movies many stories about War and the French Resistance, and besides this one may not be different from what we have known, it is very engrossing and moving.

The Naumanns have found a very peculiar way of being unhappy --actually, each one of the four members found his/her personal way of bringing problems to the family in this superb debut by Myla Goldberg.<br />Using the spelling bees as a metaphor to life and making it the cause of a familiar cataclysm only enhances the great experience of reading \\"Bee Season\\". I wasn't sure of what to expect from this novel when I picked, but after a couple of pages, anyone can realize to be in front of a talented writer. Not only has Goldberg an ability to create human and flawed characters that come to life in every page, but she also has a beautiful use of the language.<br />The narrative has a couple of twists that come very naturally due to the fact that the writer has developed them from the beginning. We know that the Naumanns won't end up in the same way they began, and that they'll be through lots of changes and difficult experiences. By the way, this is the point of writing and reading a novel. Why should we care about people's whose lives stand still for 400 pages?<br />More than a coming-of-age story, \\"Bee Season\\" is a deep look into the contemporary dysfunctional family, and the role that education and religion play with its members. Western and Eastern religions are present in this narrative and have an important function. Their battle is one of the central turmoil of the novel, bringing characters against each other, setting a familiar chaos.<br />One of the most beautiful characters is the mother, Miriam. She is the one who brings a central twist to the narrative. But she is so well developed that when all her problems come up, they don't sound gratuitous, rather, they are real and sad.<br />Every member of this family has a serious issue to deal with. But mostly the children have to suffer the consequences of their parents' choices. And when this happening, it is devastating. With \\"Bee Season\\" Goldberg is able to drawn into a lake explored to exhaustion, and she manages to climb to the surface alive and full of originality. Her characters go downer and downer and still manage to keep their humanity; and this is something rare in a book nowadays.<br />A quick summary of \\"Bee Season\\" may put off some readers, but it shouldn't.

Thompson's \\"The Rum Diary\\" is knows as \\"The Long Lost Novel\\", and since it is such an entertaining book that we all should be grateful that it was found. Written when he was only 22, the novel is a very down-to-earth account of a young man's experience of working as a journalist in Puerto Rico circa 1960.<br />Paul Kemp is a thirty-ish with no much hope for his futures. He leaves his New York and moves to Puerto Rico, to work in the only local newspaper published in English. Far from a wealthy reality he dawns in a mad world of drinking, love, jealousy and other insane things, mostly with the help of his journalist friends, until he goes as down as possible and realizes it is time he grew up. Or not.<br />Written in fine prose with the speed of someone who devours a barrel of rum, \\"The Rum Diary\\" is Thompson at his best. His first novel has more stamina, imagination, passion and truth that many experienced writers will never acquire. Writing as someone who knows the cause, the author is able to create believable characters and situations. Anyone who has spend a week in a newspaper knows that there are all kind of people self-proclaiming journalists, not to mention yelling editors going insane all the time, and demanding heads off every day.<br />We can find in the book --and in real life-- every sort of weirdos that are trying to find a better existence somewhere else far from home. These outsiders that inhabit Thompson's novel are the real thing, which paints a vivid portrait of people thorn between the passion of being a journalist and the fear of never acquiring any real thing in life. Deep inside this is the moral dilema that comsumes Kemp. While on one hand he has the freedon he always wanted, on the other there is fear of the newspaper being folder and losing his job with nothing in that strange country. While this doesn't happen, he can consume himself with many shots of rum at Al's.<br />With such a realistic portray, Thompson throws his readers to the heart of this late coming-of-age tale, set in an exotic land in difficult times. Political and economical issues are in the background of the tale taking it to another level, making the book not only fun to read, but also important. The constant riots between local people and foreign journalist only prove that Puerto Rico was an incendiary place, in many levels.<br />However, \\"The Rum Diary\\" is not a novel with wide appeal, most people won't identify themselves with the events and the characters and will be put off. But those who can stick with Thompson's masterful narrative will have fun all the time.to the heart of this late coming-of-age tale, set in an exotic land in difficult times.

The characters are Dubliners, but above all they are human beings and act as such, and this makes this collection of fifteen stories so universal. Moreover this book is a good start for readers who want to read Joyce and are afraid of his most famous and notoriously difficult works such as \\"Ulysses\\" and \\"Finnegans Wake\\".<br />The tales are supposed to be read in the order they are published because they follow the natural course of the human life. The first ones deal with childhood, then with adolescence, later adulthood --and in this segment some of them deal with public life-- and the last one is called \\"The Dead\\", making it clear that the stories follow the sequence of life events that happen to everyone.<br />Joyce's brother Stanislaus Joyce once wrote that the book pairs up stories on common themes: adolescent life, sporting life, artistic life, amorous life, political life, religious life, and celibate life (male and female), plus four 'petty employees' (two married and two unmarried), plus the final story on 'holiday life'. But this kind of classification is only a plus when one reads the book, because what really matters is Joyce's ability to create real people and situation.<br />Not only does the writer makes a wonderful job when developing his characters in such a small form of telling a story, but he also has a sophisticated command of the language. And some academics claim that \\"The Dead\\" is one of the best --if not THE best-- piece of short fiction written in the 20 century.<br />The view of the human nature in this book is quite dark most of the time, dealing mostly with the failure or the impossibility of acquisition something desired, Joyce is able to sneak in the human soul and its incapability of coping with loss, fear and another difficult feelings.<br />Most of the stories in \\"Dubliners\\" are not easy to be read, but all of them are a real pleasure to be discovered.

Sure his short tales are not as good as his plays, namely \\"The Seagull\\", but they give a fair dimension of this style and interests.<br />And his interests lay rather in the development of the characters psyche than plots twists or an elaborated story. His stories are more about creating an atmosphere than drowning the characters into it. See the first story, for example, \\"The Black Monk\\". It is actually a study of the madness, or, for some, the portrait of a supernatural situation. It depends on which side you are coming from.<br />Another good example is \\"The Lady with the Toy Dog\\", probably my favorite Chekhov short story. The characters are so real and human that it is not impossible to suffer with them. Like in most of his work, the author tackles with sociological and psychological analyzes of the people he has created --and they end up being as a metaphor for all the human kind, be them Russian or not.<br />Once enjoying this book, the reader can move to more of the Russian author. There are plenty of short stories and wonderful plays to be discovered.	2004-04-04

One of the most famous anti-hero in the policial literature is back to kill and play his game one more time. But Tom Ripley doesn't like to kill. But we, readers, are always willing to read his next adventure.<br />Having his own moral and ghosts, Ripley is one of the most fascinating characters created in the 20 Century. He is so peculiar, and nuanced that many writers tried to copy him, or even invent someone similar, but none works. After all, there was only one Patricia Highsmith, a master of thrillers.<br />There was such a tie linking her to her creation that it is hard to tell where one finishes and the other begins. Both are very cultured, smart, with good taste. But I don't believe she's ever killed anyone --on the other hand, Ripley did. Not because he likes doing that, much the contrary. But it is like a snowball, and he ends up forced to take charge of the situation and someone gets brutally murdered. That's how his life is, since his debut in \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\".<br />Back again in \\"Ripley's Game\\" the character is forced to get involved in a crime. One more time he is forced to face all the moral and personal dilemmas of killing another human being.  At this time, he's set in Italy leading an extravagant life, but not bothering people, until someone needs his help.<br />As one of the most complex and well-developed characters in the noir literature, Ripley does not disappoint his fans. He is ready to show all his knowledge and also his skills to eliminate someone. And with her talent, Patricia Highsmith, one more time, makes us fall for the `villain'. In the hands of a less talented author, Ripley would be a pretentious mad man, that we would love to see caught by the police. But with Highsmith's skills we love him, and can imagine him being caught.<br />\\"Ripley's Game\\" is the third book in the serie. And since the character was introduced in the first novel --The Talented Mr. Ripley-- Highsmith does not beat around the bush. The novel begins in the full swing introducing a new character that will be almost as important as Ripley, and this new man will force Ripley get back in action.<br />It is advisable to read \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\", before Ripley's game so that the reader will know who he is and what he's been through.around the bush.

Once that is done, the reader has reached half way to succed in reading this book.<br />Sure the big and unusual names are not the most difficult part of this novel of epic proportions, but when one stops worrying about them, things smooth over. Those Russian names are beautiful, but very difficult to imagine how to pronounce them, and we have a tendency of wanting to pronounce everything --even if it is inside our minds. Forget the names.<br />Names issue aside, \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" is a great book --in more than one sense-- telling the story of love, war and revolution. It is possible to argue that Zhivago and Lara's love story is the central spine of the narrative, while the war and revolution work as background. This concept is too reductive, once both war and revolution have main role in bringing the couple together and them apart.<br />The three issues are what conduce the narrative. Of course the reader has the expectation of seeing the two lovers interacting together, but they spend so much apart from each other that it is impossible not to start to follow attentively the war and then the revolution. These three aspects take turn in the major focus of the action. And this is one of the aspects that make this novel so multi layered. One can find love, adventure, political ideas and a portrait of life in Russia in the period before and right after the revolution, not to mention, the portrait of the human existence that is in the whole book.<br />The characters are very well developed and human. The unfolding of the action takes time, and this why the novel may seem to be slow going at times. It is not a fault, but actually Pasternak's style. Contemporary readers may be annoyed, but not the ones who care beautiful and deep narratives. This aspect reminded me of Charles Frazier's \\"Cold Mountain\\".<br />To sum up, \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" is a very beautiful book, highly recommended. Its story may please those who like adventures, those who prefer love, and those who enjoy political dramas alike.ives.

Dealing with both personal experiences, fiction and introducing himself as a character, the writer has created a unique work that will remain in the literary cannon forever.<br />It is hard to tell what this novel is about, because it is sometimes funny, sometimes a sci-fiction, and sometimes very very sad. By using such device, Vonnegut shows the reader the absurdity of the war and of the 20 century as well. Death and life are side by side in his words. At the same time, the novel is a personal journey towards the center of himself.<br />Using a fragmented prose only enhances the experience of reading this novel. With such technique, the book requires more attention from the reader, and increases the curiosity of what will happen next, and when this part of the narrative will be resumed. This is one reason why many readers find Vonnegut's work stranger than the average writer. So he is, but in a good way. This elliptic narrative is very sophisticated and beautiful to those who read a book and care about language, character development and plot.<br />Vonnegut's sense of humor and sarcasm are brilliant turning what could be a tacky story into a deep work, filled with undertones and, psychological and political ideas. The constant use of the sentence `So it goes' display a high level of sophistication, that many veteran writers will never acquire.<br />All in all, `Slaughterhouse-Five' is an important read for everyone who is interested in good and profound books.

His harshest critics may say he has had ups and downs in his career, but no one can say that his first book is not superb --even those who don't like it. Crafting with a short novella, Roth was able to display all his qualities that he would develop later on with his books.<br />`Columbus' is nothing more than the simple story of a summertime love. A Jewish boy named Neil meets a girl, who belongs to an upper level in society, they fall in love, and, above everything, have to deal with their social difference. But the way Roth writer is so simply profound and beautiful, that it is impossible no to be touched by this little masterpiece.<br />The characters are so well developed, that the more one reads the more compelling the story becomes. Not failing to mention such a fresh sense of humor that makes this novella very funny. This same quality appears in the other five short stories gathered in this Vintage edition.<br />One may complain that Roth has not much creativity, writing about only one subject: the young Jewish man in the late 50's. But that is not really true. His stories are similar not because of the lack of imagination, but because the writer cares to focus his attention in this subject. And, although, it seems a limited issue at first, with his words it becomes easily universal, because above all the stories concern on the human condition.<br />Among the stories, it is possible to find one the finest Roth's short texts: `Defender of the faith'. The surreality of the proximity of the war and the dispute between the two main characters somehow reminds the tour de force present in the movies made by Amos Gitai. The absurd of the situation, and the characters focusing on another --maybe smaller-- issue are funny, when we don't think of the imminent situation.<br />One doesn't have to look any further to find hints of the themes and characters that would be present in further works. The daughter in `Epstein' is somehow a draft of the daughter who would appear much more developed in his novel `American Pastoral'.<br />All in all, `Goodbye, Columbus and Five Short Stories' is a good introduction for those curious to get into Roth's universe, and, it is a fundamental reading for the ones who like his books.er works.

In this novel he deals with the wave of political correctness that covers this side of the world from the 90's on.<br />From the early 90's everything you say or do has more than its simple meaning. There is always a hidden agenda, even if you don't mean that --or even if you haven't considered that. People started using terms such as `afro-Americans', but they didn't care about the afro-American rights, as long as they use the `right' term. Surrounded by this hysterical blindness the protagonist of this novel, a professor named Coleman Silk, is forced to look back to his past and assume things he supposed to be long forgotten.<br />His downfall spiral began when he referred to a couple of absent students using the term `spooks' that in his context meant ghosts, but, as he finds out later, it is also a pejorative term to Afro-Americans. He's forced to retire and his wife dies in consequence of all this trouble.<br />Silkman reaches Nathan Zuckerman asking to writer the professor's memoirs. The writer doesn't accept, but the professor ends up doing it himself. In this process of rediscovery we learn a lot of his past and how much he had to reinvent himself in order to survive. We also find out about his love affair with a young and problematic janitor, whose ex-husband brings them a lot of problems.<br />In this novel all about finding out who you were and what was made you --i.e. who you are now-- the master Roth is able to go deep into the wound of correctness and the need of lying and faking who you are so that you can be accepted. As Silkman finds out, people didn't like or admire who he was, but who they thought he was.<br />With his analytic vein, the author shows the American dream going bad, proving that the end of the century --and this new one-- is damned with a disease of people being fake most of the time.<br />Using his razor sharp style, Philip Roth has delivered another winner, a novel full of undertones and truth that may make people feel sick. The reading can go a bit slow, but it is not a problem, because in the end one gets more than he/she expected. Not recommended to everyone, but to those who like literary novels.ne-- is damned with a disease of people being fake most of the time. <br />Using his razor sharp style, Philip Roth has delivered another winner, a novel full of undertones and truth that may make people feel sick.

Some are great, others not, but they are always at least enjoyable. The man writes with so much assurance and charm that people who like deep and well-written thrillers have to love and thank him for such a great material.<br />`The Constant Gardener' is a really interesting book. It has an engaging beginning that will be solved throughout the novel. Tessa Quayle is brutally murdered in a distant region in Kenya-- where the couple lives. Before her death, she and her husband --the gardener in the title-- had felt apart. Ever since they moved to Africa, she involved with humanitarian works, while he focused in his office duties. The crime will shad a new light in her life, and Quayle will learn that Tessa is far from being what he thought she was.<br />In a nutshell the novel is Quayle's quest trying to find out who killed his wife and why. The deeper he goes, the more dirty he finds. He learns that her death may be linked to the pharmaceutical industry and its market in the third world.<br />Le Carr&eacute; has his special gift for drawing believable plots with by characters that are very human. Quayle and Tessa are people that may be anyone's friends. The dynamics of their falling apart is very true to earth. But not only them are believable, but also the supporting characters.<br />The narrative is in a worthwhile slow motion --in other words, it requires patience from the readers. But people who enjoy Le Carr&eacute;'s style will find it fascinating the way he unfolds the story until it ending. At the same time, the writer is able to touch upon serious issues like the capitalism and the pharmaceutical industry that causes at lot of harm to many countries --mostly in the third world.<br />All in all, `The Constant Gardener' is quite a decent read, but it requires a lot of concentration from the reader. It is different from the fast pace explosive thrillers that are out there, but it is still very good on its own merits.	2004-03-20

One of the best ways to be introduced to his works is the short --and even funny-- novella `The Gambler'. Working with fiction and reality, this is an addictive novel.<br />As the story goes, a gambler himself Dostoyevsky had been paid by his publisher and had a writer's block therefore couldn't write anything. He hired a stenographer to help him. So she did, and they ended up falling in love. And the world received one of the best novellas ever. On a lighter note, in 2003, this story was updated in a movie called `Alex & Emma'. While it is a great plot, the film didn't succeeded for many reasons. On the other hand, there is a movie version, also called `The Gambler', made in 1997, with Michael Gambon and directed by K&aacute;roly Makk that is much closer to the novel and much better.<br />The book tells the story of a compulsive gambler named Alexey Ivanovitch that while in a German spa casino gets involved with a couple of people, and has the greatest gamble of his life. Alexey will find love and hate, friends and enemies and will learn a lesson he will never forget. To tell more is to spoil all the fun of discovering all the twists in this amazing book.<br />As someone who knows what he is writing about, Dostoyevsky paints a vivid portrait not only of Alexey but also of the casino and its gamblers. People win and lose in the question of minutes, and the more they lose the more obsessed they are. Just like life.<br />Dostoyevsky's prose is crafted and beautiful. This is one of the aspects that make this book so timeless. The other one that the novella deals with human nature, and it nave loses interest --no matter when or where. The human soul is the same everywhere. So are our wishes and failures. And to write about it, Dostoyevsky is first among equals.	2004-03-20

By the way, the conciseness is a great value of this little jewel.<br />The most important thing in this narrative is the development of Gustav von Aschenbach, the protagonist. And Mann does succed in doing that. Once he was a famous writer that is now decadent. He goes to Venice, where he expects to have a great time and relax. Little did he know that he would find a great obsession that would bring up the worst in him.<br />Aschenbach's passion and obsession is not the one we usually think of. There is not a sexual attraction to the teenager Tadzio, the protagonist is much more concerned on the beauty and its aesthetic rather than what we would call love.<br />Mann's prose is slow going, but very beautiful what makes the book so worthwhile reading. His descriptions bring to the pages the best of Venice, and the more we appreciate the city, the less we like Aschenbach. His decadent story may be depressive, but it iluminates many issues --mostly the ones about love, beauty and obessession.<br />There is a film version of `Death in Venice' that is quite close to the novella. Both book and movie are very beautiful and high recommended to people who like great literature and cinema.	2004-03-20

It is not the kind of novel for those who expect a gory ghost story, closer to what we callterror today. The narrative is too subtle, filled with nuances that create a scary mood.<br />The story is not very complicated: in the day of his wedding, Conrad, the son of the prince of Otranto, is killed in a very surreal way. While his mother, sister and bride are terrified, his father wants to divorce and marry the bride, so that he can have another son. This event will unchain a lot of ghosts' intervention and a dark truth will be found. And for such short book --actually a novella-- a lot of things happen.<br />The events and characters are quite unrealistic, but this is where the fun of reading this book is. Not to mention the historical value of the narrative. More than a ghosts story, it is the tale of a man who usurped the throne, and the consequences he suffered. While the aftermath may not be quite realistic, usurping thrones was something quite common.<br />The biggest barrier for a contemporary reader is Walpole's language. Not that it is florid, but it is written in the way people used to speak in the 18th Century.  But while for some it is a discouragement, for other it is a joy --once we get used to it. His dialogues a descriptions easily flow. The way the writer creates the atmosphere is unforgettable. Castle is a place where ghosts seem to be, and Otranto's is a perfect place for them.<br />Moreover, there is a very positive influence of Shakespeare on Walpole. Every now and then a Shakespearian quote pops up --mostly from 'Macbeth' and Hamlet'. 'Otranto' has even a theatrical format. Square brackets are used to indicate changing, like in a play.<br />All in all, 'The Castle of Otranto' is a great novella, but it doesn't have a wide appeal. People who are used to contemporary gothic tales my found it very slow, but anyway, they should try and read, just to find out where it all began.and read, just to find out where it all began.	2004-03-14

With his novels starred by the private Detective Philip Marlowe he creates an unique world that set the patter for the novels -- and later the movies --called noir.<br />Written in 1939, `The Big Sleep' is his first novel featuring Marlowe. And it was so successful that became a franchise, but what's more important, it influenced almost every single writer who tackled detective fiction. The plot is not the most important thing in this novel. It is complicated and confusing, so leaving it aside, one can enjoy all the undertones that are part of Chandler's work.<br />More than a single genre, Noir is a way of life --for a writer, at least. Everything matters in the book, that's why the narrative is so full of a vivid description of places and women mostly. It is hard to follow who is blackmailing who and why. But it is a joy to read the description of a cigarette being lit by a woman, or the way the smoke dissolves. These descriptions are what make the prose so full of texture and brilliant. Not to mention the Californian glamour that surrounds every single page of the book. Those rich people know how to live end have pleasure.<br />Marlowe is one of the best --if not THE best-- detective created in the literature. Before him, they used to be a little boring and too nice. Marlowe is violent, visceral and he is not worried of being nice and gentle. In his trip into the darker side of the underworld he comes across every kind of criminal --which, by the way, are so alive that one starts wondering how Chandler knew so much.<br />All in all, Chandler is one of the most important writers of detective thrillers ever, and influenced hundreds of other authors --in positive and negative ways --, but in case of doubt stick to the original.	2004-03-11

And it becomes even more notorious when we know that this man will be a true revolutionary years later.<br />`The Motorcycle Diaries' is the account of a journey made by Ernesto `Che' Guevara and his friend Alberto Granado throughout South America in early 1950's. Beginning as a pair of youngsters' journey, this trip become more a self-discovering journey having as background the impoverished and exploited, but above all, not well known America.<br />As most young people, Che and Granado had late-adolescent angst and trying to find a relief they went in a journey in the heart of South America, trying to find what was beyond their middle-class homes. What they find out was much more than what they were expecting to: poor people, with almost no conditions of living, consumed by diseases and being exploited and ignored by the government and the system.<br />It is a joy to see Che transforming from almost a brat into a real man of value, fulfilled with social and political conscience, caring for the poor and sick people. At first, he and his friends are only two guys who want to be on the road and learn about the world. But little did they know how was this world they were about to learn about.<br />Nearly the end, Che is another completely different person. He, now, has social and political thoughts --almost Marxist ideas -- about the world we live in and how South America has been systematically exploited throughout the years.<br />Sometimes painfully funny, sometimes extremely sad `The Motorcycle Diaries' is a pleasant read, written with heart and soul, by someone who was destined to be big, a person who was destined to change and touch the lives of thousands --as Che did indeed.	2004-03-09

And the fact that this novel tops the bestseller list for over a year only proves that the average reader limits his/her choice to book with dubious quality. This is the same kind of readers that call Brown's moneymaker novel of high intellectual stuff.<br />To begin with \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is far to reach any level of being called an intellectual book. Plain and simple, this book is a very mediocre thriller written with no style whatsoever. As so it works for about 300 pages when its story becomes tedious and predictable. Moreover, nobody expects a writer who deals with such material to be a James Joyce or a Faulkner, but, nevertheless, there is no need of writing for dummies, like Brown insists on doing. Thoughts come in italic, and to make sure that his reader has understood it is a thought indeed, the writer pens after such sentence 'thought Robert' -- or whoever used his/her brain. To make matters worse, the vast majority of these thoughts aren't necessary. If Brown trusted enough in his reader's intelligence he would leave room for imagination and wouldn't state every single thought every character had.<br />The characters are so archetypical --and far from being human -- that they laughable. Not a single soul lives in this book. Moreover, the supposed 'mind games' are silly and for dummies. It is impossible to believe that someone could find pleasure in seeing Robert breaking a code. Da Vinci deserved more respect and not his (Da Vinci's) name and works in a material with such a low quality. By the way, using Da Vinci's name in the title and Mona Lisa's eyes in the cover of the book was a very smart move. The Renascence Genius has little to do with this book, but his masterpiece has even less. The famous painting is mentioned for about 3 or 4 pages in the beginning of the book and then forgotten. So, be aware, those who expect something on Mona Lisa's smile.<br />It is clear that Brown attempted to copycat Umberto Eco, and his most notorious fiction: \\"The Name of the Rose\\" and \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\". But he failed. Oh, boy this is good to tell how much he failed. While Eco is a genius with novels as deep and smart as extremely well written, Brown writes pseudo-intellectualism for the masses that have never read a really deep and labored book. But with \\"Da Vinci\\" the writer is reaching a part of the population who has never read something brainy. Mind you that his book is not intellectual stuff, but some people may find it so, due to their lack of background.<br />There are people with hot arguments on the theological implications on 'The Da Vinci Code'. Personally speaking, I believe that with his fantasies Brown may have managed to get closer to the truth than we have ever expected. But his prose is so plain, so silly that it is impossible to take his side. Nevertheless, I wouldn't take the other side either.<br />Readers who look for intellectual and well-written material should stick to the original one, i.e. Umberto Eco. Brown is for the masses indeed, for those who read a book for mere fun and not for the ideas.

The book received a Pulitzer Prize and was made into an Award winning movie. This novel is one of the best when it comes to portrait the consequences of the Great Depression in the life of poor families that were forced to leaver their homeland to search for food and jobs.<br />The narrative is filled with details of the landscape and the people. The main characters are the Joad family who embarks in a road trip to California, where they expect to find a better life. Throughout this journey they run into every sort of people --good and bad -- that will help, or not, them. Every new stop is a new challenge for the family, a new barrier to overcome.<br />Not only is the story beautiful, but also very compelling. Steinbeck created an unforgettable portrait of those lives, which were so sad and difficult. One of the major qualities of `The Grapes of Wrath' is the language. While the narrator has a clear and grammar-perfect voice, the author could reproduce the dialogues with perfection. They were written in the way those migrants would talk. It is difficult for the contemporary reader, but not impossible. Such device requires more attention of the reader, but it gives more pleasure once one gets used to this language.<br />This novel interweaves two different kinds of chapters. In one of them the writer sets a general view of the migrants, their way of life, their habitat and such. In the other he talks about the Joads. Using such device, he makes the Joads' story universal. This single family could be everyone's who has to leave their homeland to find job and food in another place. The problems this family face are very down to earth. And, this kind of thing still happens everywhere.<br />With `The Grapes of Wrath', John Steinbeck created a story that criticizes not only the ferocious capitalism, but, above all, the human nature. The evil nature that always wants more and more, and that doesn't mind exploiting, deceiving and hurting other people to fulfill its ambitions.evil nature that always wants more and more, and that doesn't mind exploiting, deceiving and hurting other people to fulfill its ambitions.	2004-02-27

Known as one of the most difficult North American writers he made justice to his reputation. But, what in someone else's hands would be totally absurd and pedant, in his is words turned into magic.<br />`The Sound and The Fury' is one of his most famous and most difficult novels. Indeed it is. However, at the same time it is one of most beautiful works ever done in English. The book tells the story of a supposed sexual abuse of a girl name Caddy. Her three brothers and a servant tell the story and its follow up. Most of the book is told using the stream of consciousness technique, what, if on the one hand makes the reading difficult, on the other only enhances its pleasure, once one gets used to it.<br />The characters are fabulously developed. The three brothers are like real human beings, due to the fact that they are complex, filled with good and bad feelings and actions. And while their segments in the novel don't make too much sense, it is the last one, the one narrated by the servant, which makes some points clear. But, above all, do not start read `The Sound and the Fury' expecting a regular novel or something straightforward. This is a sinuous book; things pop up and disappear in the change of paragraph. And this makes Faulkner's prose so brilliant, because all these devices are perfectly orchestrated.<br />Virtually everyone who reads `The Sound and the Fury' faces a problem with the time change in the book -- from one word to another it may be years. There are no magic advices for overcoming this device. The only thing one can do is reading with attention. Nowadays there are some good Internet resources that may help the reader to understand time in `The Sound and the Fury', and while they are great when it comes to this point, they do not --and don't even intend to-- replace the actual reading of the book.	2004-02-24

With his work he was to create a huge portrait of the life in the first half of the 20th Century in United States of America. East of Eden is among his masterpieces, in which he is capable of bringing to life real and vivid characters, influenced by their habitat.<br />The novel follows the life of a family, concentrating on its two offspring since before their birth. Steinbeck also inserted his own family and himself in the book as minor characters and this device sort of gives him authority to talk about the events and people.<br />Not many writers were able to draw such a convincing portrait of such people. By choosing the right words and building the right sentences, the author gave depth and beauty to his novel, so filled with descriptions.<br />East of Eden has survived for decades and praised as one of the most perfect North American novels ever. All this due to Steinbeck geniality. Despite his labored prose this book is not difficult to read and understand. Its reading flows easily and from the beginning the story captures ones attention.<br />Nevertheless East of Eden is not for everyone. Many readers may not connect with the prose and the story. People who usually read contemporary fiction with dubious quality should stay away from any Steinbecks novel, and not to read it only to appear to be highbrow.	2004-02-22

We follow him from a small and naïve boy worried with school grades until when he is a grown-up in love with the Finzi-Contini girl and has his political sense developed.<br />Bassani has a wonderful prose. Many pages of the book are devoted to beautifully evocative descriptions of things like the house, the city, the garden. That is one of the things that make this book so magical.<br />Another one is its vivid characters. Everyone seems to be real people and not literary creations, and this is a great achievement for a writer. The narrator is the person who goes through the most drastic transformation.

Matters are worse after a chemical accident that threatens his and his family's life. It is with such originality that DeLillo deals with the subject that wit readers are simply hooked after a few pages.<br />The writer has a neat and sophisticated prose, and the plot of this novel is so smart that it is funny. His comments may seem to be about the average North American man, but it turns out that he is able to reach everyone in the Western civilization. It is curious that with 'White Noise' DeLillo created such a prophetical novel, foreseeing events like AIDS and anti-depressives.<br />DeLillo does not writer for the masses and this is one of the reasons that his novels does not make a huge success. His target is the smart and experienced reader who is tired of average prose and writers afraid of dealing with the disease. DeLillo's White Noise is sharp and cutting and doesn't please those who are used to best sellers.<br />Above all things, 'White Noise' is a novel of ideas.

Describing and criticizing with brilliance things from a time she lived and knew, the writer was able to create a timeless book. Something that nowadays, almost a hundred years later, is still fresh and very important.<br />The most important thing is not if we have wisdom or not, but what we do with the wit we have. Edith Wharton, for one, used her in a brilliant way creating some books that will last forever, such as `The Age...' and `The House of Mirth', showing people how a beautiful society can be mean and hurt whose who dare to be different.`The Age...' and `The House of Mirth', showing people how a beautiful society can be mean and hurt whose who dare to be different.	2004-02-15

The play is delightful, with borrowed elements from many genres. There is comedy and romance, above all, but there is also a very clear social critic -- and even a Marxist idea of class struggle. What only enhances the reading of this masterpiece.<br />Professor Henry Higgins is a linguistic expert who is much more interested in how people say the words rather than what they say. He ends up taking a bet that he is able to transform a simple cockney flower seller, Eliza, into a sophisticated and refined young lady, who would be able to fool the Queen herself. To succeed in such a move he claims he will change only the way she speaks.<br />To work on Eliza he puts her up in his house and starts polishing her speech. This is not an easy job, because what the girl speaks is not English, but a language she has developed herself. After some time, the Professor decides to introduce her to a group of friends, without mentioning her backgrounds. At first the meeting is blast. Although Eliza can use a fine language it is clear she has not backgrounds to develop and keep up a conversation. And her behavior ends up being the laughing stock. But one of the guests notices how beautiful the girl is. Higgins feels sort of jealous and this could lead their relationship to another level.<br />Shaw's prose is funny and touching at the same time. He uses devices, like everybody speaking at the same time, which only enhances the fun of the play and brings more truth to the action. His characters are lively and well developed. His social critic is evident. Eliza doesn't want to be rich or sound as such, she only wants to get a better job in a flower store, in other words, she only wants to be what she is. But the Professor insists on making her another person, very different from what she really is. Eliza's presence is the sweetest thing in the play. She is a nice and good-hearted girl, who suffers the consequence of her surroundings.<br />The play is based on the Greek tragedy `Pygmalion and Galatea', and was the base for one of the most famous musicals of the cinema, `My Fair Lady'.s the sweetest thing in the play.

PC-ness aside, actually it is hard to believe that such a book would be written in the 90's. It smells counterculture; it smells like the sixties. This story wouldn't come from a mind of a contemporary writer, because by our time the issues have change. Have they?<br />Ken Kesey's `One Flew...' is usually read as an allegory of the individualist. Free-spirited McMurphy is the rage against the machine --personified as the nurse Mrs. Ratched. After the new patient is admitted into the hospital the `fatal attraction' is instant and mutual. They both represent different things, and fight for different sides.<br />The story is told by Chief Broom an Indian --or a Native American, pick which one you prefer-- that pretends to be deaf and dumb, just to be left a lot and not be bothered by the other inmates. As he is an almost invisible presence --at least before McMurphy arrives-- he is allowed to some `privileges' that the other ones are not. He can clean the meeting room white a meeting is taking place, and he can hear --although the staff thinks he cannot-- what is being discussed. Having this character as a narrator gives the reader the chance of knowing the inside side of the story; at the same time one can have the required distance with the Chief's observations and comments.<br />Sarcasm is one of the Chief's chief use of language. He has a unique mind to comment the events around. For instance, at some point, talking about the hospital he says that `there is something strange about a place where the men won't let themselves loose and laugh'. Besides, even being considered a lunatic, he has a very down-to-earth view of reality. When thinking about the nurse after she has another big fight with McMurphy, the Chief tells to his readers: `to beat her you don't have to whip her two out of three or three out of five, but every time you meet'.<br />This is a wise person --after all, Indian Chiefs are the smartest ones in their tribes--commenting that the system, the Establishment is powerful and knows that it is not easy to defeat it. But it is not impossible either. This was the purely 60s way of thinking --and one must be grateful to that, otherwise the world would be even worse.<br />There is a movie version, directed by Milos Forman and staring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. The author Kesey abominated the movie --and reportedly never watched it-- because the Chief is not as important in the film. However, it is still a good and interesting movie.<br />A contemporary writer would probably tackle the issues in another way, not so plain and sincere as Kesey did, creating a metaphor that will last until the day we have master and slaves. And, the last time I checked, it is not going to end very soon.every time you meet'.<br />This is a wise person --after all, Indian Chiefs are the smartest ones in their tribes--commenting that the system, the Establishment is powerful and knows that it is not easy to defeat it.

Anne Rice --writing as A. N. Roquelaure-- wrote a whole trilogy showing to us that the `ever after' includes a lot of sex --actually sex, spanking and sex again.<br />Writing an erotic novel was a clever move of Rice, thinking of fairy tales for grown ups. The novel begins with the last scene of the original story, but instead of awakening the Beauty with a kiss, the Price uses all his manhood. After that, the beautiful princess is taken to his kingdom where she becomes a sexual slave --not only his, but also many to people. At an early point she is introduced to BDSM and is humiliated and [warped]as many ways as possible. And so the novel goes, with all the possible humiliation and some sexual games. Nothing other than this.<br />There isn't enough plot to fill in a book, let alone a trilogy. One starts wondering what Anne Rice has done with the two other books. `The Claming of Sleeping Beauty' is reduced to a lot of spaking, and not so much sex. Of course, there is a `love story' between Beauty and another slave who also happens to be a prince, but it is not near enough to grab the avarege reader's attention. I guess one must have some interest in BDSM to keep interested and read the whole book --the others will feel bored after a hundred pages.<br />It could have been a more interesting book, would it have dealt with some issues like womem freedom and sexual behaviour. But the way it is, it is very simple and doen't have a wide appeal. Moreover, it could have, say, 50 pages less, because the novel is too repetitive. It has a good start, a good idea, but it goes bad, unfortunatelly. At some point, the prince Alexi --who Beauty truly loves-- starts telling his story. And, alas, it is very very similar to what we have read thus far. If his his story could be told in 30 pages, why does Beauty's need 200?<br />All in all, `The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty' is a clever spin off, but it can't keep its interest for too much time, unfortunatelly. Maybe one has to read the whole trylogy to understand it, but why three books if something could be told in only one?eping Beauty' is a clever spin off, but it can't keep its interest for too much time, unfortunatelly.

Not because it has detailed sexual descriptions --although it has a lot of sexual tension in its pages--, but because it has a candid portrait of the desire and showed the nobles in a way that they weren't used to seeing. Even the Queen, Marie Antoinette, had her copy and read the book with a different jacket, so that nobody wouldn't know she was reading Choderlos de Laclos' masterpiece.<br />The book is the collection of a more of 100 letters exchanged by a group of nobles in the end of the 18th Century. One of the things that make this novel so brilliant is that is supposed to be a work of nonfiction. The first thing we read is an Editor's disclaimer, where he tells his doubt on publishing these letters. Moreover, he states that the adventures told in those letters could not happen in their time. Then we read a preface written by the author where he tells that he didn't write the letters; therefore, it is not a work of fiction.<br />And 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses' is so well written that one can believe it is not a work of fiction. Laclos is able to switch his point of view in every new letter; but what is more remarkable is that every person has his/her style and the letters seem to be written by different persons.<br />In the story there are so many webs perfectly linked that it is almost impossible to put 'Liaisons' in a nutshell. It is easier to state what it is about, albeit different people can have different conclusions on a given work. This novel shows how empty and self-centered the nobles were; that they couldn't notice how much power and money the bourgeoisies had acquired. More than a sexual analyzes, this book is a sociological study of the emptiness of the French nobles.<br />This book has been adapted to the cinema a couple of times, and my favorite versions are the French one made in the 60s by Roger Vadin, that has a jazzy cool appeal; and the 1988 version directed by Stephen Frears, with a script written by Cristopher Hampton, based on his own stage play --needless to say, based on the novel.s a jazzy cool appeal; and the 1988 version directed by Stephen Frears, with a script written by Cristopher Hampton, based on his own stage play --needless to say, based on the novel.	2004-01-15

It is because of Him that the novel's protagonist Scobie ends up taking drastic --and tragic-- decisions.<br />`Heart' is set in a West African state, where a British man called Scobie lives with his wife and some other foreigner, while the War is consuming the world. He is a police officer who is very honest, competent and has no ambitions in his career --to his wife's disappointment. Louise Scobie, the wife, gets shocked when she learns that he was passed over for promotion. She feels that the most important people in local society --i.e. the English ones-- don't like them, and she spends most of time trying to be their close friend. When she's tired of that place she decides to move to South African, leaving her husband alone. But for her travel, he is forced to borrow money from a Syrian criminal, who likes Scobie because he is incorruptible. Or so he thought.<br />Not long after his wife leaves, Scobie meets the young, beautiful and widower Helen. He falls in love with her, and that's when his downward spiral begins. He is tangled in a web of lies and has to deceive and betray his wife, friends and department. But, what makes matter worse is that he is a very religious man, and to God's eyes he is committing a huge sin, and this is what most consumes Scobie.<br />At a certain point, discussing with friends the idea of hell, Scobie states that he doesn't believe that hell is a place full of flames, but the sense of loss. And this shows how Scobie is sent to hell --in life! -- when starts losing everything --even his dignity. The devotion to God -- or so believes Scobie-- has a main role in this point of his life, and he is a torn man, fighting against what he wants, because he thinks it is wrong.<br />Greene is a master storyteller, and is able to create very believable characters and situations. He once stated that he believed Scobie to be a little far fetched, but even if it is true, the character serves well to a specific purpose. The language is very elaborated without being difficult or boring, it only enhances the reading of such a great novel.lieved Scobie to be a little far fetched, but even if it is true, the character serves well to a specific purpose.

Instead of setting the novel in her beloved and well-known New York, with the wealthy people, the action happens against a bleak New England background, and portraits the life of a very poor man. But, this issue aside, 'Ethan Frome' has the same virtues of other Wharton's books, like the Pulitzer Prize Winner 'The Age of Innocence' and 'The House of Mirth', that too many experts is her masterpiece.<br />Ethan Frome is a young man who quits his studies to take care of his father. Later on, when he mother dies, he marries his cousin Zeena, who took care of his mother. He marries her because he doesn't want to be alone --and not for love. Only after their marriage does Frome realize that Zeena is a hypochondriac, and leads an existence claiming to be sick all the time, and visiting doctors, spending most of their money with medicines.<br />Some time later, her cousin Mattie moves to their house, to nurse Zeena and do the house chores. Mattie is the opposite of Frome's wife: she's beautiful, young and full of life. They fall in love. But Ethan's story won't have a happy ending. Telling it is no spoil, because we know from the first chapter that something tragic happened in his life. The novel begins with a nameless narrator telling how he met Ethan Frome and that a tragic event happened to this man's life.<br />By using this device, Wharton only increases the tension in the novel, because we do know that something will happen, and the more we read, the more curious we grow, to find out what had happened. The novel is set in the Wintertime, and Wharton is very gifted to describe the environment and characters. We can feel the cold weather during the whole story. It feels as if we were there with the characters, 'freezing' together. Of course, the coldness is much more than only in the weather --it affects the characters too, their hearts and lives.<br />'Ethan Frome' was published almost a century ago (1911), but it is a very modern book. In the narrative, Wharton uses devices that became common only throughout the 20th century --like irony and flashback. Ethan marries a woman that keeps him from realizing his potential and being a fulfilled human being --and it is a question that became very popular in the late 20Century.<br />'Ethan Frome' is a great novel written by a master who has made wonderful books.

Mostly basing on his personal experiences and people he knew, J.M. Barrie created a work full of subtle undertones that have been subject of deep controversies.<br />Rather than the story of a boy who refuses to grow up, a new approach on 'Peter Pan' has been developed. One of the most interesting is the one which is based on the analysis of the three primal female characters: Wendy --and Mrs. Darling, as well--, Tinker Bell and Tiger Lily. According to experts, they represent aspect in women that Barrie found intolerable. It is largely known that Barrie had serious problems with his mother, which may have led him to use such bipolarity on motherhood in the book. While on the one hand Mrs. Darling is a loving and concerned mother, on the other, Peter's --and the lost boy's as well-- mother abandoned him -- leading him to an eternal search of a mother figure, however unconscious it is.<br />The sexual aspect of the novel is so subtle that for many people it may be unnoticed. However, it is clear that the book deals with several taboos, being incest the most recurrent. Peter and Wendy have both a mother/son relationship, and also there is the wish of being 'lovers' --recurring to Oedipal myth. This is one of the most interesting aspect for the books --at least when it comes to an adult approach on 'Peter Pan'. According to Jacqueline Rose's 'The Case of Peter Pan, or, The Impossibility of Children's Fiction', \\"The sexuality which matters is both more and less explicit than this. It is sexuality in the form of its repeated disavowal, a relentless return to the question of origins and sexual difference which is focused time and again on the child\\". This is what makes the novel so intriguing: it is possible to read 'Peter Pan' is more than one way --and all of them are more and more interesting.<br />When it comes to kids themselves, this book is part a fairy tale, part an adventure and a familiar ode. These aspects make 'Peter Pan' appealing to both boys and girls. The characters while archetypical --this is unnoticeable to children-- are very vivid and it is not hard for young readers become their 'friends'.  At the same time, all the 'sexual' aspect of the book is so subtle that parents can't be afraid of allowing their children to read the novel.<br />However, the unabridged 'Peter Pan' is not advisable to very young readers due to its fanciful language. When it was written in the early XX Century, that was the current language, but, nowadays some words like 'ofttimes' and 'diffidently' are not very common in a 10 year-old lexical. The narrative is told in first person, and the narrator used a lot of 'I''s which only bring the children closer to the story making it easy to feel part of the adventure --it was very smart of Barrie, because with that he makes friend with the child, and the story flows as if they were exchaging confidences.<br />All in all, J.M. Barrie's 'Peter Pan' will always be a children's fave and it deserves its place in the Fantasy Literature canon and will amuse young --and not-so-young-- readers forever.and a familiar ode.

The dialogue is so sensitive --without being tacky --that it is impossible to deny that we are with a very unique book.<br />'The Piano Tuner' is one of the most impressive debuts of the last few years. The writer is able to put together an exotic land and a different tale about power, colonialism friendship and love. Edgar Drake is a British piano tuner who is invited by the British Army Office to go to Burma to tune the Erard, a very expensive and beautiful piano that belongs to an eccentric army surgeon, and that became indispensable to the imperial design.<br />And off he goes. On arriving there, he finds a mysterious place, populated with beautiful and 'savage' people --but what touches him is the piano itself. A wonderful piece almost lost in the middle of the jungle, but soon he learns how important it was for the colonization of the place.<br />Little did Drake know how much he would get involved with the surgeon, the place, but above all, with the piano. It almost becomes a love affair. But things change and Edgar ends up in the middle of a situation he would never expected to be.<br />Using a crafted prose, Mason is able to bring the reader into the story. Although sometimes it is difficult to imagine the exotic place, he describes in details many contents, so that we can have a clear image of how Burma is like. The best character is Anthony Carroll, the surgeon. He is a mystery throughout most of the book, until a surprise near the end. Unfortunately the women and the Burmanese are a little stereotypical, but this is not something that really spoils the reading.<br />Mason has written about things he knows set in a place where he knows very well too. What is left unknown is if in the future he will be able to write about another things. All in all, 'The Piano Tuner' is an interesting book: very vivid and colorful. It is undeniable that Mason has a gift for storytelling and we will be looking forward to his next book --be it set in a place he has been to or not.gs.

Notwithstanding it is very dated, and today's readers/audience may find it boring and hard to understand, because there is a very long interval since its first performance to the XXI century.<br />Although women, unfortunately, still have much to fight for when it comes to rights, they are no longer like Nora, the play's protagonist. She is a complete doll, living to his husband's, Torvald, will. Due to his health problems, she has involved with not reliable people, and borrowed money. Years later, when he is safe and sound, she is still paying her debts --however, he doesn't know it. In order to keep her lie, Nora is involved by a snowball effect, where one lie leads to another one, until the moment when it becomes unbearable.<br />While I much like the feminist thematic of the play, analyzing it as a literature work I think there are some flaws in the text. The most important character, Nora, is not very well developed. We can easily notice how repressed she is; and we do expect her to take charge in her life and do something, but when it happens, in the very end of the play, it seems to be so unrealistic that it is hard to believe she is a human being rather than a character of a play.<br />Another thing about Nora is that she is extremely selfish. If on the one hand, she does things to help her husband recover, on the other, she's doing it because she's afraid of losing him, and being left helpless alone. Moreover, in the end, she simply quits her life --good for her!--, but she doesn't care about her children. How convenient it is to leave their three small kids, claiming she is not a good person and will harm them. She becomes a free person, and under no shadow of doubt, her children will grow up problematic people.<br />Above all things, 'A Doll's House' is a play, and it doesn't deny its origins. The dialogues are very theatrical. The monologues pop up in almost every page, compromising the natural flow of the events.<br />All in all, it is still a good play, and has its cultural and social importance. It portraits the hypocrisy of XIX Century European society, when women had no power at all, and were brought up to satisfy their huband's will. It has lost its freshness and power, but still stands up as one of the first work with a feminist thematic, and for that matter should be read and known.pop up in almost every page, compromising the natural flow of the events. <br />All in all, it is still a good play, and has its cultural and social importance.

And here it is. Daniel Wallace's 'Big Fish' does not disappoint when it comes to explore this universe.<br />It is not a novel, but a episodic book, nevertheless, it must be read in the order, because they chronologically tell the story of Edward Bloom, through the eyes of his son, William Bloom. Edward is dying and in order to reconstitute his life, his son starts telling his (Edward's) stories --somehow, he believes that telling this father's adventures is a form of keep him alive. Like his father advises to him once: 'Remembering a man's stories makes him immortal'. Of course, that to William's eyes his father is a hero, more than that sort of a mythological figure-- hence the subtitle of the book 'A Novel of Mythic Proportions'.<br />From time to time, a chapter called 'My father's death' pops up, and this is the bitter side of this bittersweet book. While most of Edward's stories are sort of expanded jokes, these chapters are much more serious --even being funny when Edward shows up-- and sad, because that's when William has to come to terms with that his father is dying.<br />When commenting a hard fishing, William states 'Only a fool or a hero would try to catch a fish that size, and my father, well -- I guess he was a little of both'. The love that William has to his father is touching. More a dreamer, like a Don Quixote, it is hard to tell how Edward really was, because his stories a very fantastic --he fights against giants, meets fantastic creatures etc.<br />As a book of episodes, it is undeniable that they don't share the same level, some are much better and more developed that the others. It seems that Wallace put a lot of effort in some particular chapters --which ended up being very good, by the way -- and working in others segments in a hurry. It is clear that 'The Day He Left Ashland' and 'In Which he Buys the Town, and More' were much more crafted than the rest of the book. It is not a majot flaw, because the writer's style is light and he keeps it most of the book, but when comparing these two particular chapters to the rest of 'Big Fish', one notes the difference and wonders why it happened.<br />As a whole, the book is fairly good, whit funny and sad moments, that will certainly touch many hearts. Nevertheless I wonder about its gender appeal. I'm not sure women will enjoy 'Big Fish' as much as man. Of course, the girls can like it, but maybe not for the same reasons boys do.ear that 'The Day He Left Ashland' and 'In Which he Buys the Town, and More' were much more crafted than the rest of the book.

When you reach the end, you'll understand that she was probably kidding with you. The whole book is to tell `irony' from `reality' and `sarcasm'. But all that is there, in the very first page.<br />Written in the first person we meet Franny, a NYU English professor, who embarks in a sexual self-discovery journey. She is a free spirited person who doesn't like to be attached to anyone. After a brutal murder her in neighborhood she meets officer Malloy. They end up clicking and having wild sex. While on the one hand, her life seems to be getting exciting, on the other, it is becoming dangerous. More similar crimes happen in the town, she can be a potential victim, and, the worst part, she is suspicious that Malloy is involved in the crimes.<br />Moore needs only a couple of pages to set the mood for the novel: it is dark --very dark -- and inhibited. It is a sexual thriller with many hot scenes and not so many thrills, but that's not a problem. The first time I read this novel, three years ago, I hated it with all the strength I could. Now, I can't say I loved it, but certainly I had a difference response to the book.<br />In the second time I wasn't so surprised when the narrative abruptly stopped for Franny and Malloy to have their wild intercourse. Moreover, I wasn't so so so shocked with the disturbing end. I still can't accept such a thing --as that extreme act of violence-- but I could come to terms with that being the end of Franny's narrative. I could even appreciate the last line and all the irony in that.<br />Moore seems to know what she writes about, and what the reader is expecting from her book. The novel is a self-discovery odyssey of a woman who thought she knew about relationships. Bearing that in mind, we can't expect much from the book. It is a late coming-of-age tale. I couldn't agree more with some reviewers that say that `In the Cut' has a shallow plot. It is indeed, and if you don't mind much about it, you can draw yourself into the book. It is a quick read, but not for everyone, the graphic images and violence shock a lot.y that `In the Cut' has a shallow plot.

One of the best American novels of the 90s, this book is not for everyone. Part an unconventional love story, part a War story, but above all, the study of the human condition, the novel requires patience from the reader.<br />To experienced readers, who like literary works, it is not difficult to fall in love with this narrative. The story is slow, the writer builds his characters and situations bit by bit --that's why people who are looking for a war adventure or a conventional love story should stay away from `Cold Mountain'.<br />The focus on three main characters: Inman, a soldier who deserts the battle and embarks in a journey to meet Ada, his beloved who's trying to keep going the farm left by her father, and Ruby, a mountain-girl who helps her with the farm. Throught his journey, Inman meets a different cast of characters --some people help and some not-- that more than anything exemplify the human condition, mostly in war times. Meanwhile, Ada, who can't keep in touch with him, tries to survive in the farm her father left. She will count on the help from Ruby, a simple girl who knows a lot about nature and farming and wants to help Ada, as long as she is treated like an equal, and not a maid.<br />After the story is set, and the characters introduced, Frazier is free to left the three main characters dominating the narrative. Although they are not the narrators, we're allowed to see their most inner thoughts, fears and joys. Every character is believable, in my opinion. Everyone has his/her life changed because of the war, and all of them are wounded souls.<br />The narrative is very descriptive therefore many parts are static. And although the story seems not to be going anywhere, it actually it --but it is very subtle. For some readers, this kind of device is a problem --while for others this is truly beautiful. Not many writers have the ability that Frazier does to do such device. What in many narratives could be a bore, in his is simply wonderful to take a time off and look around, to see how much the environment has changed with the war.<br />Inman, Ada and Ruby are unforgettable. While he has one different supporting character every chapter; the two girls become close friends, in a beautiful friendship of mutual need. While Ruby can teach the mysteries of the nature; Ada helps her friends to learn things like arts.<br />All in all, Frazier has written one of the best novels published in the 90s. This is the kind of book that requires a lot from the reader, but it gives back much more. It is very rewarding to follow Inman, Ada and Ruby in their journey, however long and difficult it is.o do such device.

US	49577356	R2HSPXHSF54VN8	0679720200	882163178	The Stranger	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A foreigner in his own life	I don't believe Albert Camus had any that idea that his novel `The Stranger' would be so popular and timeless when he wrote that book in 1946. It is not a fluke, but he didn't seem to have many aspirations and pretensions when writing this short, but amazing, book.<br />In a nutshell, `The Strange' is the story of an Algerian, Mr. Meursault, who loses the strings of his life, and leads a flow of events decide his fate. The narrative begins of the death of his mothers. He is forced to go to the retirement house where she used to live and attend the funeral. In doing so, he feels strange, and doesn't seem to have any tender feeling toward his dead mother-- to the surprise of the local people. Later on he starts dating Marie --but notice he doesn't love her. It is just that it is easier to be with her, than being alone. He ends getting involved with Raymond --who seems to be not very honest. And in an unfortunate event he kills an Arab. That's when his life falls apart. Well, it would, if he was a normal person but he is not.<br />Camus has created a vivid --albeit lacking in energy and chutzpah -- character to be the protagonist of his novel. Meursault is not a normal person, however he is just the French average Joe of the mid 40s. He doesn't have many aspirations for his life; he lets the flow of events drive his life. The book is so well written that after a couple of pages you really feel upset with him. Is he incapable of showing feelings, or doesn't he have any feelings? These are questions raised throughout the novel, but it seems that the writer never came up with a plain answer to that, because it is not easy.<br />Like it is stated in the novel `Everything is true and nothing is true.' Like in life, it is nothing is really one thing. It all depends on a referential to what is true and what is not. Meursault seems to not have this referential. He simply doesn't care about being alive and governing his life. With this Camus shows all that generation angst. They seem to lack strong feelings, or even any kind of feelings.<br />`The Stranger' is one of the 20th Century classics, one of those books destined to be discussed forever-- because it generates so many different interpretations. More than book, it became a cultural event. It is a novel that deserves multiple readings.ey seem to lack strong feelings, or even any kind of feelings. <br />`The Stranger' is one of the 20th Century classics, one of those books destined to be discussed forever-- because it generates so many different interpretations.

We are never happy with what we have-- we always want more, and we always have a hard time trying to fulfill our egotistical desire. This wish is what moves the characters in Patrick Marber's play `Closer'.<br />A group of four characters get together and falls a part. It begins when the stripper Alice meets the journalist Dan. Months later they are married, he has written a book, and he meets the photographer Anna, who's taking his pictures to the book jacket. Dan grows obsessed with Anna. In an Internet chat room, while pretends to be Anna, Dan meets and have `sex' with the dermatologist Larry. They arrange to meet in the Zoo on the following day. Larry goes there and by coincidence the real Anna is there. They end up getting together and married. This is when these four persons relationships are about to get more complicated.<br />It is undeniable that what moves Marber's characters is the sexual attraction, rather than love itself. People desire each other, more than love --albeit they can say they are in love. Dan seems to be the kind of man who wants to be with as much women as possible, while Larry appears to be in love, at first. But this feeling total disappears and becomes a feeling of revenge --sexual speaking. He wants to hurt both Anna and Dan. On the other hand, Alice has a blas&eacute; behavior at first, which ends up being an obsessive sexual relationship as the time goes. Moreover, Alice develops a sick patter through the years. Anna, while seems to be a strong and independent woman at first, turns out to be fragile until when she is hurt very hard, and has to be strong again.<br />The dramatist manages to give a sad and honest look in love and desire in our times. His characters and situations are totally believable and well developed. We can go inside people's feelings and understand what moves them. Not a single scene has flaws-- everything and everyone are where they are supposed to be. A great play for our times.eat play for our times.	2003-11-30

Byatt's `Possession' or Arundhati Roy's `The Good of the Small Things' or Michael Ondaatje's `The English Patient' to name a few. DBC Pierre's `Vernon God Little' stands in its own merits.<br />It is a story of a teenager Vernon Gregory Little who is accused of shooting some other kids at school. The book begins with a jailed Vernon telling his story. He has been accused of something he claims not having done. Living in a weird place, and with a strange mother, the boy has not so many people to ask for help, until he comes across a so-called CNN journalist, who turns Vernon's infamous act into a show. There are more things when the plot unfolds, but telling that is spoiling the readers' fun.<br />It is strange a book whose subtitle is `A 21st Century Comedy in the Presence of Death'.  We know that the author is dealing with a sensitive subject that terrorizes everyone nowadays: the killing of children at school by their own mates --a Columbine-like act. But one starts wondering how he turned that into a comedy. Pierre's tactic is to make a satire. Does it work? For most of the book it does.<br />`Vernon' is one of those novels that leave us with mixed feelings: at the same time we want to like that, there are parts that make it impossible to top this book in your favorite books list. The reason for that is simply the author's ability. One on hand, Pierre has created anthological passages such as: `The Constitution (...) is a tool of interpretation, for the governing majority of any given time. (...) [And] we are the majority. This is our time.'; on the other hand he insists on a game of words playing with their sound and meaning, like saying `paradime' instead of `paradigm'. This is so bad to the development of the narrative that he stops toying with this idea after a couple of pages.<br />The feeling left is that this novel is a sort of fluke. Pierre was not taking himself too serious, and wasn't confident that he would be published one day. Therefore he wrote whatever popped up in his mind. It is not a bad thing, but while we feel the writer has potential, some events any many characters are not as well developed as they cold have been. Most of them are stereotypes, archetypes rather than real people. Maybe this was part of the author's project of this satire, but, I believe, the book would be much better with real people instead of The crazy Mother, The Journalist-from-hell, so on and so forth.<br />`Vernon God Little' is far from being a bad book --but it is not great either. It is fiction at almost its best. With a good heart and a funny spirit Vernon manages to grab some hearts, but I still believe DBC Pierre could do more than that to get our much-deserved admiration.too serious, and wasn't confident that he would be published one day.

Bearing this in mind, his play `The Importance of Being Earnest' is one of the most useless pieces ever written. Writing a simple and funny play, the play writer managed to criticize the hypocrisy of the Victorian society in this comedy of manners.<br />The whole story is around the words `earnest' and `Ernest'. More than toying with the words and their sound and meaning, Wilde is talking about the `masks' that people put in their faces by that time. Nobody is really what he/she seems to be. The two main characters Algernon Moncrieff and Algernon Moncrieff create another ego that they pretend to be their brothers-- to such device they call Bunburying hence the name of Algernon's brother. <br />What is very clear with this plot is that Wilde shows how one has to lie in order to succeed. However, in another level, Bunburying is way of describing homosexual liaisons or is a way of escaping from the chains of the marriage. By the way, marriage itself is strongly criticized by the author in this play. The two marriageable girls are interested in men whose names are Ernest, no matter how they look or what they do. <br />All the undertones of the play aside, `The Importance of Being Ernest' is a quick and funny play, full of great lines that could only come from Oscar Wilde's mind. Just like Lady Braknell says to hurry a marriage: `I am not in favour of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.' Simply funny, acid and true!	2003-11-23

Written in the 1950s' it was an instantaneous scandal for dealing so clearly with teenagers and their sexuality. The times have change, we see the world in a different way, adolescents are the same, but this novel still holds the interest.<br />C&eacute;cile is a precocious seventeen-year-old girl who travels to the French Riviera in the company of her father and his mistress. She is used to having different women around with her father all the time. But when he decides to marry one of them, C&eacute;cile and her lover Cyril decide to do something to stop him. Meanwhile, she is also learning about life, love, sex and pleasures. All these life-changing experiences will make the girl grow up towards to womanhood.<br />Françoise Sagan writes about something she knew, and it makes the book very interesting to read. Her prose never sounds fake or far-fetched. Although, it is a little dated --some of C&eacute;cile's acts that were daring by that day are just `normal' nowadays-- it has not lost its freshness. The Riviera settings are beautifully described, and we're often asking what the girl will do next.<br />It is undeniable it is a novel about that time in our lives when we're not a child any more and not yet an adult. With a mind filled with questions, we're trying to define who we are and will be in the future to come. C&eacute;cile has to face tragic events to understand what her life is and what it will be like for the next years. While many consider her being a spoilt little brat, this is the time when she is forced to stop being that, and see she won't have her father papering her forever.<br />`Bonjour Tristesse' opens with a powerful paragraph that reads: `A strange melancholy pervades me to which I hesitate to give the name of sadness'. At this point, had we any doubts it is a book about teenage angst, they are all dissipated.<br />Sagan wrote this novel when she failed to pass her examination at Sorbonne. The book became an international best seller and also a movie. While `Bonjour Tristesse' is a short and quick book, it is a good work of fiction, and probably Sagan's masterpiece.an international best seller and also a movie.

Everybody is being watched, every single move, words; they dress code reveals a lot: women with big hats, men with fancy suits and top hats. This is the society they are trapped into. It is very hard to get into it, and easy to be dumped out of. This is the world where Edith Wharton's characters from `The House of Mirth' inhabit: the early XX Century New York. Actually this is the world where Wharton herself lived in.<br />Lily Bart is a marriageable orphan who is trying to marry a rich man. Her first victim is Percy Gryce, a very rich and insecure man, guided by his mother. When this attempt fails, her friendship with Laurence Selden almost leads to a match, but rumors of her being friends with married man, only brings her ruin and social exclusion. A series of unfortunate events --among them losing money in gambling-- and a very mean `friend' called Bertha Dorset lead Lily to the ruin.<br />More than anything, `The House of Mirth' is a study of the social condition of the New Yorker wealthy women in the early XX century. Rather than being a heroine, Lily is a human being struggling with her problems. She is neither rich nor strong enough to be independent, so that marriage is the only way of keeping a comfortable life, unlikely man. Early in the novel, Lily and Selden are discussing marriages and she says that `a girl must, a man may if he chooses'. This states clear the difference of men and women, the lack of freedom, and the way people have to live under the social establishment if they want to succeed.<br />Writing as an insider --and so she was-- Wharton is able to give a faithful and acid view of that society. Inspired from a verse in the Bible, she titled the novel with a wonderful contradiction; there is neither a `house', nor `mirth' in the novel. They both are very abstract ideas that we get from the book.<br />`[Lily Bart was] so evidently the victim of the civilization which had produced here, that the links of her bracelet seemed line manacles chaining her to her fate'. I believe the writer felt this same way --maybe that's why she moved to Europe and lived there for many years. Personal connections to the book aside, Edith Wharton has written one of the best American books of the XX Century.

Chronicling a period of almost ten years the lives of two families who have neighbor graves in a cemetery-- the Colemans and the Watherhouses--, the writer takes us to look inside the Edwardian society in the early XX Century.<br /> Essentially this is the story of their two girls, Maude Coleman and Lavinia Waterhouse. They became friends, and then neighbors. And while the families are not very found of each other, they can tolerate one another. Besides that we also have Kitty Coleman, Maude's mother, who seems to have lost passion for life and is trying to find something exciting that changes her life.<br />After all the main characters are introduced, the writer is able to unfold a breathtaking story, full of twists and turns, that make you only looking forward to turn the page and see what will happen then.<br />In my opinion, the novel can be divided in the three different parts: 'Life X Death', 'Kitty's Awakening' and 'Death X Life'. In the first part we learn about the traditions about funerals, and how each character stands on it. In the second, more political, it shows Kitty involvement with the suffragettes. And in the third one, characters have to cope with death, and the entire struggle after that.<br />There isn't a single narrator in the novel. Each chapter is told by one character --even servants have a chance to tell their point of view of an event. While this may not have been the wisest form of narrative, Chevalier manages to hold the reader's attention, because all the characters are interesting and have something to say, which counts in the main narrative.<br />Somehow, this novel is quite different from Chevalier's previous books --'Girl with a Pearl Earring' and 'The Virgin Blue'. She seems to be more confident, and is not afraid of touching upon issues like death. Although this sounds like a book about death, one must be really close to this theme to talk about life. Only in a novel like this a reader would find such a sentence: 'What people do with their dead is usually a reflection of themselves rather than of their loved ones'. 'Falling Angels' may not be a sociological study of funeral rites and women's position in the early XX Century in London, but, as far as fiction is concerned,  it is the next best thing.about life.

Coetzee's The Man Booker Prize winner `Disgrace'. Telling the story of single man, the South African writer managed to give us a deep portrait of life in his country post-Apartheid.<br />David Lurie is a professor who, after having a relationship with a student, is fired. His only refugee is his daughter's farm in the countryside. His idea was to spend only a couple of days there, but after a violent event he is forced to stay there, analyzing their father-daughter relationship, to learn who to live in a farm, but, above all, to live in a different country.<br />Were `Disgrace' only Lurie's personal journey to self-discover it would be a great novel, but as soon as Coetzee brings politics and racial issues in the novel, it is lift to another level. The story and characters are quite well developed. The three acts of the novel are very clear, and interlinked. The last part is the best, when all the turmoil comes to a conclusion --very plausible, by the way.<br />When David and Lucy --his daughter-- face an act of extreme violence, they are left helpless. And so is the reader. At a certain point, one can't believe in what is happening. You feel as shaken as them. The aftermath is very well developed and believable --not to mention the twists in the last pages.<br />Halfway through the book, when they are talking about it, its consequences and what can be done, Lucy says that in another time and place it would be different. David asks what place is that, and she replies `This place being South Africa'. If you had any doubts that you'd been reading a political book so far, your queries are dissipated. At this moment the writer shows all his cards.<br />Coetzee is not looking for reasons or solutions, he is advising what his country came down to be, and that now `black' and `white' people have to live together and come to terms with each other. For this matter, Lucy and her `neighbor' Petrus have a fine purpose. Each represents one racial group, occupying the same piece of land, having to stand the each other.<br />With `Disgrace' Coetzee created a sort of fable that is perfect for our time of intolerance. Don't expect a teary ending. Like life, he makes no concessions. With his down-to-earth book, Coetzee's ideas are kept with us long after you've finished the novel..

Would he be able to produce another novel as lyrical and dreamy as his debut? Or was he another fluke, a one-book wirter?<br />It took almost ten years, but it was worth waiting. His follow up is as good as `Virgins', if not even better. `Middlesex' is many things but an ordinary story. At first level it is the story of a hermaphrodite discovering his/her body and trying to cope with it. The novel is also a vast panorama of the story of the XX Century, showing events such as the genocide in Greece, the first days of Ford Motors, the Prohibition era and the 1967 race riots --not forgetting to mention life in the pos-wall Berlin.<br />History epic aside, `Middlesex' is also a personal journey of a human being trying to figure out what he is doing in the world, what life means, where we are being led to. Callie --and Cal later on-- has many questions, and no answers, and she is not even aware where to find them. She knows she is different, but she doesn't know that extension of that.<br />The first person narrative brings power to the novel. Callie's voice is beautiful and said at the same time. Her family --with no surprise-- is what brings her together. Even when she is not with them. At a certain point, one must run away from his/her family in order to understand his/her origins. And this is exactly what happens to Callie/Cal. In a level this book is a coming-of-age tale --a very very different one, but still a novel about becoming an adult, and leaving behind all you used to believe as a child.<br />Somehow, this is an extension to what he worked with in `Virgin'. We will never forget that dialogue between a shrink and one of the girls, when he asks why she tried to kill herself, she didn't even know how hard life can be. And her smart answer is that he had never been a 13 year-old girl.<br />Eugenides make no concessions. The novel has a sad tone --despite some funny parts. The lesson we learn is `life is no easy'. And we have to struggle to survive. Not many writers have the courage to write like that.

This was the very first classic novel that I ever read in English. As I needed that for an exam, and didn't have enough knowledge for reading the original I was supposed to read an abridged version. And so I did. And I loved the book.<br />Years later, I decided to read the real thing, the original novel. Much to my surprised it turned out to be highly accessible, and as entertaining and a nice read as the abridged version. Moreover, in the original book I could find all the details, and were able to savor Charlotte Brontë's language.<br />Written more than 150 years ago, `Jane Eyre' reads as fresh as a XXI Century novel. Brontë's use of language is vivid and remarkable. Her descriptions bring the book into life. We cannot forget that the book is the social portrait of the women in the writer's society. It shows how they struggled --and failed most of the time-- to reach a respectable position in the society.<br />Jane didn't have any attractive that was required in her time. She wasn't rich or even beautiful, although smart. But smartness wasn't a good thing for a woman in those days. She is even punished for having brains. She ends up being a governess, and end up having a humiliating experience, being forced to change places and even name. Ms Eyre is only noticed when she receives a heritage and becomes rich. And she does not let all she has suffered affect her.<br />`Jane Eyre' is a novel ahead its time. This book is about feminism much before the term was created. When Jane speaks to her aunt about her rights --can you imagine a girl speaking about her rights in that time-- she is doing what other women would do years later. Charlotte Brontë has managed to creat a strong and sad girl, who is trying to find her place in the world. With that, the writer made a book that will be read for generations to come --even if they read an abridged version before reading the unabridged book.ook.	2003-11-09
US	49577356	R3HFLQ9GVQWUV0	0312195516	226874686	The Red Tent	Books	2	8	19	N	N	Is it only for women?	As someone who strongly disbelieve in labels, I never thought of `The Red Tent' as a women novel. Many readers talk about it like a wonderful novel. However, I have noticed that most women who read this book enjoy it, while I haven't find many men who tried this novel.<br />From the beginning, Anita Diamant's book didn't get my attention. I found the female characters too good to be true. All the women should have a halo over their heads, because they are almost like saints. They can bear pain, they have good hearts and are full of love, while most men are men and selfish. Gender discussion aside, those people don't appeal me as characters. I found them too one-dimensional, and full of themselves.<br />The narrative in this novel is complicated. The narrator is Dinah, a girl who's briefly mentioned in the bible. On the one hand, Diamant has created her whole story from square one; on the other she didn't have many evidences of what she's been writing. We must bear in mind, that `The Red Tent' is fiction. The author herself has admitted that in her personal website. There is not proof of the so-called Red Tent, or the bricks mentioned in the novel. As far as fantasy is concerned, the novel didn't work for me. As I have aforementioned, the women are too nice and smart. Most of them sound like martyrs. I don't mean that there aren't --or even weren't, for that matter-- strong women. My issue in this novel is with the narrative itself.<br />As a man, I don't mind reading books that are supposedly for women --albeit I don't believe in such things. Calling bad novels `book for women' sounds like depreciating women's intelligence. All in all, either being a chick lit or not, The Red Tent did not work for me. And all the hype is meaningless.	2003-11-09

The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies'. Bearing this in mind, it is doubtless that Bradbury is included among the good writers. In his novel, he managed to create a parable about the intellectual wakening of a man and the dangers of censorship, in a society where people are not allowed to think.<br />In an undefined future, the firemen job is to start fire. They are supposed to burn books, and the houses of people who keep published material. Guy Montag is a fireman who has never questioned the pleasures of burning, until one day when out of curiosity he takes a copy of a book home and together with his wife he tries to read. However, they have never read a book, and while they can read, they are not able to understand, to connect the sentences. This is just the awakening of Montag's mind. We know there is something about him, and that he won't be the same until we reach the last page.<br />Rather than being far fetcher Bradbury created a timeless story. Things like those describes in the book have been happening for ages. We may not literally burn books, but books, newspapers and magazines are burnt everyday. Like he describes in the book it began with one minority ripping one paragraph, then another, then one more... until the day that it would be better to burn the whole book. We live in the age of minorities, and we should watch out some request.<br />The present edition is followed by an `Afterword' and a `Coda' written by Bradbury in first person. In the first he tells specifically about this novel, the process of writing and once more give voice to his characters to talk about themselves and they world they --and us-- live. In the second part, the writer talks about how timeless his novel indeed is. These two last chapters are very clarifying and help a lot in the understanding of the book. My suggestion is: read this novel, think of it, and see how the world can be one day. And then do your part to avoid things in this book becoming real, because `Fahrenheit 451' can be anything, but far fetched.n is: read this novel, think of it, and see how the world can be one day.

Nick Arnold has a funny way of writing, talking about things that could be boring the hands of a less talented writer.<br />The information he brings is interesting and completely new to many people. Plus, his style is easy and talks straight to kids, like he put himself in their shoes. Another great thing in this book is Tony De Saullres` illustrations. They are funny and cute-- even some nasty animals.<br />Some interesting information are provided about Mother Nature. But what I liked best is the light way that the book is written. Arnold has a gift of making what would be a bore in a funny and whoth reading book<br />My suggestion is: buy this book to your kids and read it yourself too.

If the book was only that it would be good, but the beauty of Amy Tan's `The Joy Luck Club' is beyond that. She is not afraid of going really deeper in her novel.<br />Using her own background, Tan was able to build a story with a universal appeal. The main line of narrative follows he generation differences between for Chinese women who immigrated from China to USA in the 1940s. These women although being living in Western for over 40 years, somehow managed to keep their Chinese identity, history and traditions. On the other hand, her daughters are typically North American. This would bring a lot in anyone's plate to talk about, but the writer brought the daughters' and mothers' individual problems, and all they have faced that made them what and who they are.<br />Tan's style is nice and easy to follow, albeit there are 7 narrators in the novel, each one telling her story, and how it influence --or was influence by-- her mother's or daughter's.<br />You don't have to be a woman or a Chinese-American to like this book, and even identify with the characters. This is where Tan's prose reaches the universal appeal that so many writers lack of nowadays. It is an interesting book written with the heart, and also the brains.	2003-10-12

Even though it was written more than 100 years ago, Arthur Schnitzler's  `Hands Around' is still fresh and down to earth, when it comes to man-woman relationships that will lead to a sexual intercourse.<br />Originally written in 1890s, this play was an instant scandal when first performed in 1920s. One can't help but wonders why. Don't wonder that much everything is there: sex is the main theme of this text. Yes, in this play people frankly talk about having sex for different reasons, such as money, love, power etc. This is what makes this text so timeless. A proof of this is that dramatist David Hare --who scripted the movie `The Hours'-- updated it and entitled as `The Blue Room', that brought together talents like Nicole Kidman and director Sam Mendes, to the London production.<br />`Hands' is a cycle of 10 dialogues always featuring a man and a woman. One is trying to seduce the other, who, by different reasons, is trying to escape from the seducer. More than baring bodies with his words, Arthur Schnitzler --whose one of most famous work `Dream Story' was the base for Stanley Kubrick's `Eyes Wide Shut'-- bares people souls, and brings a lot of tension --mostly sexual-- to the stage. Most of this author works' deals with Love (sex) and Death and this play is no exception. Although very subtle sometimes, Schnitzler is not afraid of talking about dissimulation and the power that sex has over people, making them do things they would never do in other context.<br />This play is a gem. Wonderfully written and with unforgettable characters. Nevertheless, it is not for everyone. Some people may be offended with so many invasions of our minds and souls.	2003-10-06

Sometimes it reads like a big Victorian soap opera-- in the best sense of the expression-- and it is, indeed. Full of emotion and twists, it is like a wild ride in a roller coaster, full of ups and downs.<br />With such length, it is obvious that 'The Crimson Petal and The White' is full of details. And what could have been a bore in the hands of a less talented writer becomes a total joy in Faber's. One can notice how deep he went in his research, to bring us so many delightful details that only make his prose more vivid and colorful.<br />The characters are another chapter. Of course they have flaws both as human beings --what is expected from a book -- and as a character, but that doesn't spoil the novel. The most developed ones are Sugar and William Rackham, but the supporting ones are well written to.<br />Some people complain that the novel leads to nowhere, but I don't agree. Of course some actions don't fit the main plot of the book, but I believe they are just like life: not everything has a point. Faber has composed such a sharp web that even the plots that don't make sense in the main story are interesting on their own.<br />All in all, it takes time and a lot of energy to be devoted to reading such a huge novel, but I think it is worth reading. And when it is over, we have spent so much time with Sugar and her people that it is sad to let them go. Well, we may have a sequel. Why not?	2003-09-24

They have been hiding for many years, but end up found by an adolescent who lives nearby. Telling more is spoiling the fun of reading the wonderful novel wrote for kids, but that may please adults alike.<br />What I liked most is how subtle the writer deals with the ecology preservation is in the novel. The Tucks got eternal life from drinking the water of a pond, and there is a man in yellow suit trying to buy the place where the pond is, so that he can bottle the water and sell it. I think that somehow the writer is showing us how dangerous it is to mess up with Mother Nature. All the time, Babbitt talks about the importance of the forests and the water to life.<br />This is a book that will sure last forever. In a hundred of years people will still be reading this novel and enjoying it. Kids may grow used to technology, but they will always be touched by such a simple and lovely story. So will adults.	2003-09-14

Putting all pride aside, Elizabeth Wurtzel has written a powerful memoir about what it is to be a person suffering from depression. She shows how complicated life can be, and how important our friends are to help us getting out of such a situation.<br />Many people complain that the book is full of self-pitty. Sure it is, but I don't think it is really a problem. We can get through it. I found the writing very touch and sincere, and Wurtzel a brave woman to come so clean about he problems. I do believe that writing was somehow a catharsis that helped her to `overcome' her condition. The `Afterword' present in the paperback edition is clarifying and elucidates how much we aren't aware of our conditions and ourselves.<br />It is a good book --but depressive (but it is not a surprise, since we know what it is about). Nevertheless, it is not recommended to everyone. I suggest it only to people who have suffered from depression and to those who has a least interest in the subject, otherwise, it won't be interesting for you. If you enjoy this, I also recommed `Bell Jar', by Sylvia Plath; and `Girl, Interrupted', by Susanna Kaysen.	2003-09-14

As a character, she define fashion, charm and desired, and she has lived in our imagination since when the movie was released. But before the movie there was the book. Written by Truman Capote, `Breakfast at Tiffany's' is one of the best novellas ever written in English. The charm, the style, the passion, all is there.<br />This is more or less the book that defines the glamorous New Your in our mind. The city is virtually a character, as important as Holi's cat, so to speak. Its urbarn landscape is pictured in our minds as a happy place, where one can help but having fun whenever one wants. At least this is what we get from the protagonist's behaviour.<br />Capote's style is full of charm and passion, and the length of the story makes it precise and almost flawless.  Maybe we wouldn't have succeded had he written a long novel about Holi. Things and people pops up in her life and a few pages later they are gone and forgotten. Lucy are the ones who had the luch to meet her.<br />The other three stories in this book are quite good not, although not as nearly as famous as `Breakfast'. `House of Flowers' tells a story about love and how much we sometimes give up in order to be with the one we like. It is a story of a girl who is trying to find her place in the world, but all she finds is not so many good people. Those people are not bad, they just aren't good. `Diamond guitar' is about two convicts who become friends and how important this friendship is for them in order to survive the difficulties of jair. But, of course, something will came up and may --or may not-- set them appart. The last story `A Christmas Memory' is a little jew that should be saved for Christmas time. It is about the unexpected friendship about an old woman and a seven-year-old boy.<br />To sum up, the four stories in this edition deal with misfits, that are trying to survive in a wild society that does not accept too much poetry and sweetness. This book is a high achievment for world wide literature. And later, with `Breakfast at Tiffany's' an achievment for the cinema.poetry and sweetness.

It is amazing to see of how much this guy went through and came up a winner. Yes, he is. Living among those people many others could have surrundered and gone crazy.<br />If his book were fiction, it would be too, well, unbelievable to be true. But since it is Burroughs's memoirs, we do believe in those `characters' that he brings to his pages. We all know that there is all kind human being out there --even the most strange. So, why not have them all toghether in the same house? If it were fiction we'd say it is strange to have them all in the same place, but it is reality and it is not by chance that so many strange people were gathered in a house.<br />Burroughs has a powerful voice, and his narrative is dense and funny at the same time. Sometimes we forget how bad that could be living in such an environment, because it seems that he had fun indeed with some things --not everything, of course. `Running with Scirssors' is one of the best memoirs released lately and it must be discovered to open people's mind and eyes to how really complicated life can be sometimes, but, we can still manage to be a survivor.	2003-08-18

(If you want something depper and brainny try Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum )<br />What I liked most about it was the way the author developed the situations, making it a non-stop thriller about books. Now, when I started reading `The Nautical Chart', I was expecting something more or less in this way --something that at least kept me interested me in. Little did I know that the two books share only the same author in common. `Chart' is much more boring and less interesting than `Club'.<br />Supposedly this book takes you to place where many others have taken you before, such as `Moby Dick', `Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World', `Old Man and the Sea' etc. It is about the SEA and the relationship that MAN can have with it. It feels like this link is to be a metaphor, or something like it. It could have been a contender, but it is not. I believe the main fault are the main characters, Coy and Tanger. Question about Coy, like `what's up with this man?' floated in my mind all the time. And about Tanger, the clear vision I had of her is a spoiled little brat. Not forgetting to mention the `bad guys'. They couldn't be more cliched. Another thing that spoils the reading is the abundance of details --moreover, useless details. You keep waiting for the story to come, and when it does, you're too tired of reading the details of ships, and sailors' way of life.<br />But, I still have some faith on Perez-Reverte. Yes, I do. I had so much fun with `The Club Dumas' that I can't start hating this guy. One of these days I will try another of his books. I only recommend this one to his die-hard fans.	2003-08-18

We just assume some things beforehand and expect that our assumptions to be<br />true. When I started reading `Three Junes' I wasn't sure of what to expect.<br />Maybe another `chick lit', or something alike, but I couldn't be more wrong.<br />`Junes' is a wonderful novel, an impressive debut. It is hard to believe that<br />this is Julia Glass's first novel, because she has such an use of language and a<br />confident style that many veteran writers don't have. I read an article on Glass<br />and she says to be interested in how people manage to survive after having their<br />heart broken, and that's exactly what she does in the novel. Sooner or later,<br />every character have their heart broken at least once, and they try to survive<br />--if they'll be able to accomplish that is another thing. That is where Glass's<br />power as a writer is. Her creations are very vivid and believable.<br />The book has its own pace, and the story changes time without much explanation--<br />what brings a major charm to the novel. The flashbacks come and go, but they<br />make total sense to what's being told at the moment they pop up. It is a gift<br />for avid readers to have such a `slow' novel in this time of disposable and fast<br />literature. You read word by word and be transported to another time and place,<br />and you start feeling you know those people, and that they could be your friends<br />in another life.<br />Somehow Julia Glass reminds me of Michael Cunnighan --which is a great thing in<br />my opinion. Of course, each one has his and her own style and peculiarities,<br />what make their prose unique, but they share a lot in common: mostly a tender<br />view of some so called `outsiders' that aren't cool enough to be a beatnik, but<br />still that can't fit in the common place of society.<br />My suggestion is be good to yourself, and give your inteligence and good taste<br />this lovely gem. And mark this name, I believe we will hear a lot more of Julia<br />Glass. We, readers of prose with quality, deserve that.

His books of essasys `Me Talk Pretty One Day' is one of the funniest things I've ever read. And not only is it funny, but it is also very witty. His text is so good that you don't want to put it down, because you know that in the next page there will be more laughing coming for you. Moreover, his comments about life, family and being a foreigner are very pertinent and never silly.<br />There `characters' --real life people who are related to Sedaris-- are so good that you may believe they were made up, but on the other hand, we know that there are every kind of people around, so the people in the book they do exist. My favorites are his sister Amy, Bonnie(this woman deserves a whole book about her!!), his brother Paul, aka The Rooster (and believe me You Can't Kill the Rooster!). I believe that all these people should be flatered on being in Sedaris's book, because he writes about them with such a passion, that even when he is making fun of them it is impossible to be angry with him.<br />It is hard to choose one favorite essay because they are all so good, but there are a couple of them that can be pointed out as even better. My favorites are `Picka Pocketoni' (you have to read to find out what it is!), Go Carolina, The Learning Curve, The City of Light in the Dark and Jesus Shaves. But above all, the essay title Me Talk Pretty One Day is close to perfection. Anyone who has taken a single class of a foreigner language will easily identify him/herself to the story. Everything is there: the student who can understand everything but the most important word in the sentence and is afraid of having to talk, the native teacher to whom everything is obvious, the student who knows `everything' and is only taking classes to polish his/her language --but, as a matter of fact he/she wants to snob the other ones who know less than him/her-- etc.<br />My suggestion is: after a hard day, find a confortable armchair, open this book, and have non-stop laughs. And if you read this book and don't laugh, please, go to the doctor, you must have serious problems. Enjoy it! And Congratulations, Sedaris. I'm looking forward to reading more of his writings.-stop laughs. And if you read this book and don't laugh, please, go to the doctor, you must have serious problems. Enjoy it!

With A Fine Balance he proves he can writer about the human soul and social condition with the same love for both aspects of life. Moreover, there aren't many writers around there who can keep readers' attention for more than 600 pages. In `A Fine Balance' there is something going on in every chapter, and from time to time, a new characters pops up, and he/she is as well developed as those who are presented at page one.<br />In my opinion, `Balance' is, among other things, about the social condition overcoming the human codition. Not only are the main characters struggling to survive, but they also need to fight in order not to lose their human condition, and become animals. And, believe me, in their times and place, it was not an easy thing. The book also succeeds when shows how politics interferes in everybody's lives --even in the one who are not interested in that.<br />`A Fine Balance' is a great book and a wonderful read. But I something weird happened to me when reading it. On one hand I wanted to read it as much as I could, all the time, on the other, once I put it down, I wasn't very excited to get back to it again, but once I got I would read 30, 40 pages in a row. This thing had never happened to me. Maybe because I was scared to find out that no matter how bad life is, it can always get worse. In the book when you think that the characters' lives are bad and there is nothing else to happen to them, think again...<br />Mistry has written a book for our times. You may not like it, or even understand, but it is impossible to finish it and still think in the same way about life, about being a human being.	2003-06-22

I found `Rules' much better written and interesting than `Psycho'. <br />Ellis writes as someone who knows what he's talking about --and he does know. Growing up in the early 80s was not easy, and the generation who had to face it grew up a very messy one. We're talking about coming-of-age in the time when individualism was the international order -- live for yourself, and forget the others, no matter how much celebrities clamed `we are the world'. Nobody really cared about the other, in that time the term `Politically Correct' meant nothing. And in this enviroment Ellis brings some of the most interesting characters of his literature: a group of 20-something who is discovering life. Yes, above all, they are getting in touch with their inner selves, and that's why they are so `dirty' and mean. <br />Actually there are no rules when it comes to have sex, everyone does it with everybody --people weren't very aware of AIDS (it was a `new' disease) so the characters made free love. Everyone is seeking everybody, and it doesn't really mind with whom they will go to bed, as long as they don't go alone. But, you know, there is still some hope. Love may happen when we less expect, but it may not get along well with sex --at least in Ellis's world-- and every character suffers its consequence.<br />I highly recommend this book, because it is a fun reading.

Well, don't let the hype surrounding `Everything is Illuminated' put you off. This novel is magic, funny and sad at the same time. It is impossible to deny that Jonathan Safra Foer has talent and he will be (already is ?) one of the finest American Writers --with a deserved Pulitzer coming soon.<br />Reading his debut we wonder whether it is a fluke or the result of hard work and talent. I would go for the second option. Anyone can notice how hard he laboured every single sentence, the characters, the plot. There are three stories that will meet each other in the end. The first one is a story that's being written by an Ukranian guy called Alex -- his butchered English is one of the funniest things in the novel, and it make the book lighter, what is really good, once it deals with  such a depressing subject. His segment is about how he, his grandfather, a she-dog named Sammy Davies Junior, Junior and an American boy named Jonathan Safran Foer went to find the woman who avoided  Jonathan's grandfather te be killed by Nazis. The second story is the one written by Jonathan that tells the story of his family, and how it turned out to be what they are. The third segment are Alex's letters to Jonathan, again in a strange English, so to speak, he tells how his own story is developing and gives a lot of opinion on Jonathan's story.<br />Alex's letters are unforgettable. We can discover a lot about the life of a young Ukranian, his dreams, joys and fears. Reading between the lines, one can easily note that a young person's life is more or less the same everywhere in the world. And this is one of the things that make the book so universal. Jonathan's segment is full of magic --that loosely reminds of Gabriel Garcia Marquez-- and delightful.<br />This is a wonderful novel that will be read for years to come. A book that has a light in everypage, that illuminates not only the novel, but life itself., but life itself.	2003-05-25

I found it very beautiful with this dark red in the background and the photo of a male and famale body in blue. But when I started reading the book I was hooked by Robert Olen Butler's style and narrative. This is not an easy book. Full of undertones, and with a specific pace, masses will never be able to enjoy it. It requires a lot of strengh to go through all the pain of its pages.<br />Ira Holloway is the narrator, but form time to time he lets women he knows to speak for themselves, rather these women whisper to him their inner thought and desires, their view of the situation. When he meets Fiona, they immediately fall in love, and get married, but they can have a normal life, because both are hunted by dark past secrets that may lead the to hell. Him from the Vietan war, and beautiful Vietnamese that he loved. Her secrets are about her childhood, and they may push her toward madness. After his son is born he changes completely --well, sort of-- and starts to concentrate his love on the boy --and consequently to the boy's mother (his wife), once he doesn't her to suffer and make the kid suffer too. And this is really beautiful.<br />It is admirable how sincere Butler is when it comes to both male and female feelings. One may wonder how he knows so much about human psyche and the process of loving and desiring someone. This book is a great read, but, again, not for everyone. Some people may be offended by Butler sincerity and even call him sexist-- what is not true. Moreover, it is a book that it is not easy to forget.	2003-05-25

One may read `The Seagull' and wonder what's that all those things about death and killing, and failing love stories. So sad! But in Chekov's world this is a comedy, and it doesn't take too much to get why. It is indeed funny in some parts-- well, not the kind of funny we are used to, but nevertheless, it makes us laugh.<br />The tragicomic play is of paramount importance in modern teather. Rarely has a playwriter written such a realistic piece analyzing the life of an artist and his/her role in the society. In `The Seagull' Treplieff is a writer  wanna be, who is trying to grow over the shadow of her mother --an aging actress--, and to get an actress wanna be to love him. But above all, he has to deal with feeling jelous of Trigorin a youger and successful writer. There aren't many characters, but there is so much going on, personal dilemas, that the story grows to a placeless dimension.<br />Chekov can write with such a confidence that for not a second you doubt the existence of these people. His words are vivid. More than 100 years later, his play is up to date dealing with issues that are universal and timeless-- that can make you either cry or laugh.	2003-05-12

It can be even worse when you have a problematic pregnant sister who is getting divorce, and you can't express yourself in the language spoken in this country. Well, this could be problematic enough, wouldn't Isabel --the protagonist of this novel-- bring more problems to her life, making `Le Divorece' an interesting book.<br />Diane Johnson has a nice style, and the book keeps in a good peace, being funny and tragic at the same time. The characters are well developed, as long as you consider the rich people's lives--don't expect people working or doing something serious. But it is not a problem, because that's the way they can be. The French are...well, French -- in all the senses the word can have. And the relationship between the two countries' people are cordial, albeit you think there must be a hidden agenda somewhere.<br />More than a novel about social and cultural diferences between USA and France, as one may expect, this novel is a coming-of-age story, of a girl who has to travel many miles in order to find herself. Only after arriving is Europe is Isabel total free to experiment with her life, and other people's lives so that she can find out who she really is. Not that she hadn't suspected it before...<br />I think Diane Johnson avoids falling into traps that the theme could have lead some other less experienced writers. She is not afraid of showing how silly we can be when it comes to make a good impression on the other. A highly recommended novel.	2003-05-12

Period. While Chivalier's work is deep and remarkable, Moggach is interesting and that's it. What first attracted me in the book was the thematic, but in my opinion the execution was poor. I read it very fast-- it is not a bad thing--, but I forgot in the same speed.<br />The story sounded to set up in order to grab readers' attention, rather than the natural flow such a narrative would have. The characters are okay, but sometimes too simplistic. It seems that Moggach could have used all the research she did in a better way, giving more deepen to the novel and characters.  Anyway, it is not a bad novel at all, but it is not as good as it could be either. One a lighter note, the beautiful cover worths the whole book.	2003-05-04

Well, many things, if you have just moved to another country and doing up a house is like doing up your life. In her book o memoirs, 'Under the Tuscan Sun', Frances Mayes recalls her experience when she went to Italy, bought a house and had it done up to live there-- or at least spend some months in that country.<br />With a lot of charm and wit she takes us inside the problem, or changing one's life so drastically. More than working on the house, she's working on her life, making it better. The result is a pleasant reading, funny sometimes, but above all lyric and poetic, evocating magic and the beauty of Tuscany.<br />Food is a whole new chapter in this book. It is impossible read these memoirs and not starve. But, the good thing is that all recipes are included, and you don't need to go to Italy to try them. Thank God, otherwise flights to Italy would be overbooked with Mayes's readers.	2003-05-04

He has a good style, and is a great storyteller, but somewhere in the middle I got lost --but found again in the end. I liked the way he mixed politic and religion -- and I've read he does it in many novels, so I'll probably read another of his books sooner or later.<br />I liked the first part best than the second. It was very interesting to learn the traditions in that court, but I have the feeling that most characters were human types rather than human beings. Anyway, his attention to details is one of the things that makes the reading interesting. The description of lucheons, parties and huntings are very interesting.<br />In my view, he lost the command of the narrative in the second part, when the story is set in Algeria. Local people again seem more human types, and the narrative got a bit confusing. Nevertheless, the climax of the novel  is something very interesting, and that grabs your attention, and there is one twist in the end, that makes sense.<br />Emmeline, the magician's wife, is an interesting character --of course, the most well developed one in the novel--, and despite some flaws she is totally believable. So are  her husband and Denieu, the two other important characters.<br />To sum up, this is an interesting book, but not recommended to everyone. And for me, I think I should try anothe Moore novel before deciding where I place him in my taste for books.	2003-05-04

S&aacute;ndor M&aacute;rai's Embers is one of those books for me.<br />After having this novel recommended so many times I decided to read it-- and what was my surprise if not it it is one of the finest narratives ever. Everything is subtle, the words are crafted, the magic it brings is unforgettable. After a 41 years-old break tow great friends are about to meet again for a dinner. Between them there are unfinished business, questions that one depends on the other to know the answer-- if such thing is possible. And a woman that may --or may not-- have led them to fall apart. Half of the book or so, tells the events while General Henrik is getting prepared for meeting his friend Konrad --and flashbacks tell how they become friends and what happened afterwards.<br />M&aacute;rai is smart enough as writer not to provide answers, they would be to simple and plain. Rather than that, he raises up many questions, and leaves a lot of room for our imagination. What really happened is impossible to know, but does we really care about the truth? Anything is possible, but now, 41 years later, nothing makes any difference, both Henrik and Korad have lived in shadow of those events, and it is not possible to change things that happened. It is to late for atone anything. By the way, this book will please those --just like me-- who enjoyed Ian McEwan's Atonement. Both books are superb, well written and unforgettable.	2003-05-01

And when they are combined to make a sentence, a novel, they become even more powerful. They can change lives, minds and hearts. Anyone who has found the joy of reading a book will be delighted with Dai Sijie's `Balzac and the little Chinese seamstress'.<br />After the cultural revolution in the comunist China, two friends are sent to a educational camp, where they are supposed to be re-educated, and probably forget all they have known. While they are there, both guys end up meeting a young seamstress whose thirst for knowledge and love for live is heartbreaking. They also come across Balzac. Not the writer himself, but his works and his books will change the trio's lives.<br />Sijie is a moviemaker and as so has a peculiar eye for images. In the book not only are the ideas great, but also the images the evoque are perfectly beautiful. He can be funny while writing about such a dark period in China. His words are light, but not without consistence.  the book is short but profund when it comes to show the importance of books in life. More than that the importance of freedom, the possibility of choosing, the right of expressing yourself. The writer has done a great work! By the way, he has made the book into a movie, and this one is certainly a must see.	2003-04-27

In these memoirs the chef/writer tells it all-- I mean IT all about the profession. In his words we can see revaled the darkest secrets of the backstage of either a big restaurant or a small and obscure pub around the corner.<br />Bourdain has no time for futilities he goes to the botton line. He tells what you can or cannot eat when out in a restaurant. Moreover, he shows there is no glamour when it comes to be a chef. Forget that fancy thing we see in movies, in which chefs look more like poets. Yes, you will have to carry heavy things, you will get dirty, and you'll barely have time to eat. Bourdain's book is highly recommend not only for food aficionados, but also for any good reader.	2003-04-21

But, still readers depend on what is written, it is like the writer has the power over us readers, over what we read, where we go  to or even what we think. Some may say we are deceived, led to believe in what is written, or in what someone wants us to believe. In `Atonement' Ian McEwan gets all this concept of readers/writers a goes a bit futher. A narrative is an entity over which neither the reader nor the writer has much power once it is published.<br />At a low level, `Atonement' is a coming-of-age  story about a very imaginative girl named Briony. Frustrated and unable to understand the adult's world, she destroys  a relationship, and later on her family. In the background there is the WWII, and its effect upon Brittain and its people. But digging depper into the novel we are taken to a higher level, where everything is more sophisticated. McEwan rises very pertinent questions about literature: how reliable is what you are reading? Do you believe in what the writer (anyone, not McEwan specifically) has written? How does he/she know what he/she is talking about? Does he/she have to have experience everything he/she is writing about?<br />This is what makes `Atonement' so complex and great, in my opinion. In a age of fast-food novels, it is a relief to read such a deep and complex novel in which the writer is not worried about souding cool, more than that, he wants us reader to think. He wants us to doubt everything --even what he has written. In a time when most writers wants to be the owner of the truth, `Atonement' sheds a light showing that there is no such thing as an universal truth. Everything depends on who is telling, and what effects this person wants to cause in his/her audience. A highly recommended novel to `advanced' readers, who like to think while they are reading a novel!	2003-04-19

Ever since I always meant to read his other novels, but to be honest I was afraid of not being moved as I was by his Pulitzer winning book. Silly me.<br />With all the fuss over the movie `The Hours' I really felt in the mood for another Cunningham and I chose `A Home at the End of the World'. I wish I hadn't waited too long. The book is as amazing and well written as `The Hours'. The characters are vivid and the plot deeply profund. This writer does have the ablity  to move us using the power of words. He knows how to make a reader think of his/her life and the world we live in.<br />His characters may look unconventional at first, but think again. They have the same issues everyone has--being homossexual or not. They struggle to keep on living, and they think it is possible to find true love, however they know there might be no such thing. They know life can be hard, but they still believe it is possible to find happiness --who doesn't? Even failing so many times, there is always a new chance, a new begining, and the sense of possibility.  It is definitely a sweet novel, but it is set in a bitter real world.<br />Although Cunningham's novel is superb I'm not sure it is for everyone. Some people may feel down with story, others may find it silly. All I can say is if you liked `The Hours' you're very likely to appreciate `A Home at the End of the World'. I'm looking forward to his other books.	2003-03-23

And Philip Roth with his wit and prose takes us to those decade's ugliest side. By that time it was hard to define what was normal, regular. The innocence was about to be lost, and families didn't know what they were about to face. There it comes the Levovs, the family of the protagonist of `American Pastoral'.<br />Known as The Sweede, this guy had it all. His father was the owner of a factory, he was one of the most popular boys in school, he married an ex-miss and had a wonderful smart daughter. A perfect life. Think again. Roth turns the Sweede's world upside down --and our brains also-- when he tells you look closer. So far, Sweede's life has been nothing more than a big mistake after the other, his choices were all wrong, and he never noticed it. But his life is about to fall down in the moment his daughter  bombs a local store and kills a decent man. Now, the story is like a snow ball, that gets bigger and bigger and unstoppable.<br />Roth has a very sophisticated prose which grabs the reader's attention since the very first page. The book rises important issues like, how guilty the parents are when their child becomes a `bad' person, or, if the family prepares the person to the world. I highly recommed this novel for those who are interested in a interesting reading, take will stun you. If you enjoy this book --like I do-- I think you may also enjoy Jonathan Franzen's `The Corrections'.	2003-03-16

Rather than a whodunnit, Dennis Lehane's `Mystic River' is a book about human condition. Yes, there is a crime, an investigation, some false hints, but they all are supporting roles in this novel. To me, what the author really wants to show is how impotent facing a tragedy.<br />The book follow some years in the lives of three childhood friends, that grew apart after an incident. One of them was kidnapped by two men --and may have been abused. And while his two friends could have done something to avoid the act, they didn't. The two boys grow up with the feeling of guilt, while the other grows up a bit messed up. Years later, the murder of a girl will bring them together again.<br />This is a novel that will please both thriller and drama fans. It reachs both levels with no flaws. There is a crime to be solved, and there are people living their lives. All characters go though a transformation, and nobody ends the book the same way he/she began. Very recommended.	2003-03-14

But, rather than that, the book tells a story of a man whose only desire was to survive, against all odds. That's when the book gets an universal interest. His memoirs written fresh right after the war are from his heart. His words have an effect on those who read it, that it is impossible to forget this book. He seems to have put his hate aside and written this book in the best form possible. Moreover, this new edition with some pages from the German officer Wilm Hosenfeld's  diary are specifically clarifying and show that not every German officer accept Germany's politics, but they didn't have many options too.<br />Szpilman used his passion for music to survive and with his memoirs it is impossible to forget one of those most shameful peoriods of history. It is a pitty his book was `lost' for so many years, but thankfully it is back now, stronger than ever. This is a book that must be read over and over again, so that we don't make more atrocities like those commited to Szpilman and all other Jews. Congratulations to Roman Polanski who made a brilliant movie from the book.	2003-03-09

How to prepare: mix all the ingredients there is no way of failing. In case of doubt consult an expert, my suggestions are Joanne Harris's Chocolat; Isak Dinesen's Babette's Party; and Laura Esquivel's Like What For Chocolat.<br />Elle Eggels seems to have follow that old recipe, and this is exactly the taste we have when reading her novel. You've read it before, and you're read a better story, because it was fresh. `Seven Sisters' is not a bad book, it is just not very good, that's the point. From the begining you can figure out where it will lead you. And the novel is missing in passion. I didn't care too much about the characters. Maybe there were too many people and it always made confusing which sister is who. Eggels has talent, and she should use it better. Her novel reads like a nice pie you're eaten before many times, you may enjoy while eating, but tomorrow you won't remember how it tastes.	2003-03-02

And it did. This novel is one of the most scaries I've ever read. The last one that really `stole' my sleep was `The Exorcist', and so did `House'. It became a compusive reading for me. I needed to know soon how all that would end. And, what an ending!<br />The novel tells the story of a haunted house --well, nothing new so far-- but the way Matheson describes the house and its history is creepy. The cover itself is already disturbing. The characters are not perfectly developed they have many flaws, but one gets so involved with the house itself that they actually have supporting roles in the story. The writer is not afraid of describing  violence both physical and psycological. And some parts that are very graphic may offend some sensitive people. I highly recommend this book for those who like horror stories, and are not easily impressed.	2003-01-05

While they are telling how Frank became the most wanted con is funny and interesting to learn how fragile the system is. But when they tell over and over again the same thing-- how he forged checks and pretended to be a Pan Am pilot-- the books becomes boring.<br />In the middle of my reading I got me thinking `Why am I reading this?'. I mean it is not even entertaining me. But I went on until the last pages thinking that anything really big would happen. But it didn't. The book left me with the feeling that someone up there loves Frank W. Abagnale more than other mortals, because this guy is so lucky that it is almost impossible to believe. I think the movie may be better, once it gets a `story' from the book, and not only chronicle Frank's adventures.	2003-01-05

More than a coming-of-age tale, `To Kill A Mockingbird' can be a life-changing experience. Her story is so simple, and at the same time so profound that it touchs deep inside. <br />My favorite character is Scout, the narrator. She is a girl that loves being with her brother Jem and their friend Dill. And when they are together she does things that most girls don't usually do. Their father is Atticus, a lawyer that is involved with defending a black man in the court. This experience will change their lives forever and will remain with the kids for their whole lives. Scout is a very precocious child, and her comments about people she knows are funny and sincere. She has a very peculiar view of the world and life itself.  All characters are well developed, but I became very fond of Calpurnia and Dill. <br />Harper Lee's style is easy and effective, her words are simple. This is what makes the book very accessible to everyone. This is the kind of novel that makes you laugh and cry in a turn of page.  I highly recommend this book to everybody. This is a great book, and above all things it is a denounce of human behavoir, and its flaws.	2002-12-24

Skipping Christmas ends up being a light and funny read, perfect for this season of the year. <br />Luther Krunk has a very original idea, for this year, he and his wife will avoid all that crazyness -- a.k.a. Christmas-- that most of us have to face in December. Instead of sending cards, buying lots of food, inviting many people and having to prepare them a party, the Krunks will travel to a sunny and beautiful place. Well, sort of. Throughout the novel he will deny all the Christmas costumes, but later on... well, it is more or less what you are predicting from page one, but, in my opinion, that is where most charm of the novel is.<br />Grisham deliveries a Christmas story with all you expect from it. He can easily talk about all that expectation we have in the days before December 25, the feeling that waiting for the party and preparing it is more exciting than the real thing. Plus, between the lines you can read that Christmas has changed a lot through years. It is much more about buying gifts and food, and trying to show how rich you are, rather than the birth of Christ itself. One last thing, I think this is the best time to read this novel, I don't think it works in the same way if you read it in, say, June or September. In order to really have fun, we must be in Christmas mood.	2002-12-15

The most important thing in the novel is the people that live in it than what they do and where they actions led them to. This is the case of `House of Sand and Fog' in my opinion.<br />Andre Dubis III is a gifted writer when it comes to character development. People in this novel are so real, that even if you dislike them you can understand who they are and what they are doing. The three main characters, Kathy, Lester and Colonel Behrani are very believable, and it is what makes the novel interesting.<br />In alternating the narrator's voice betwenn Kathy and the Colonel, the writer allows us to see both sides of the problem and to understand their both reasons to want the house. Through the novel, we can see clearer the reasons for wanting the house. More than a simple house, the building means a lot for both of them: their lost past and all expectations for the future.<br />The novel is strong and its second part is really difficult to deal with. The ending is complex and can be very depressing for some people. I liked it very much, and I hope to read it someday again. Highly recommended.	2002-12-01

But, in some cases, a day means the whole eternity. This is the feeling left to me when I finished David Benioff's The 25th Hour.<br />Monty will be jailed for 7 years for drug dealing. He has only one day to say goodbye to his friends, girlfriend and father. This novel follows him during his last hours while he tries to come to terms with going to jail and losing everything. Moreover, even his friends are in a borderline situation, where they must solve their problems and start again. It is easier for them, because they will be outside, while Monty won't. It feels that they will always have a second chance, while Monty won't.<br />Benioff's style is very interesting and melancholic. His particular choice of words can make the reader sad, and I feel this was his intentation. He is a very talented writer to put down in word so many feelings that many people would avoid to think of. I'll look forward to his next works.<br />The 25 th Hour is a melancholic book about lost chances. Moreover, it is a novel that tells you not to miss a chance in your life. Life is short and there may not be time to do everything again. While we follow Monty's destiny we find out ours, and we realize that no matter how young we are, there is no much time left for us doing everything we want to do. It is a depressing novel, but highly recommended.	2002-12-01

Many people read this novel, and it is not a literary gem, but it is good, since it is so sincere and honest. As we all know the book tells the story of a nanny who works for a very wealthy family in New York, and she tells us all the problems an joys of her job.<br />Maybe for dramatic purpose the X family is a bit caricatic but they work as characters. Everyone knows women like Mrs X who doesn't care all their kids, and let another woman take care of them in every field. Mr X is also a bad father, husband etc. Actually I think they are terrible as human beings. What scares me is that we know there are people just like them out there. We all have met many.<br />I felt very sorry for the boy. And I was glad that Nanny was very nice and genle to him, despite everything she felt for his parents. I wonder what kind of adult will a child became having such a childhood without mother love. They don't see their son as a kid, but just as a thing they can use to promote themselves. What is the point of making the child face interviews to get into a school? Poor Grayer, had to face all that just for his mother own satisfaction. I think we all get upset with the Xs.<br />The last chapter is very strong and I feel it as a catharsis for the two writers --former nannies-- when they said (wrote) everything they always thought and wanted to tell to parents but they couldn't for many reasons. I think that only in the last chapter I realized the seriouness of this novel. More than a novel it is a yell to the world, telling `Parents love your kids above all things'.	2002-12-01

Fielding Pearce and Sarah Willians have one of the strongest love affairs from recently literature. They are meant for each other, despite their antagonistic political beliefs. They live togheter, and Pearce can't come to terms with Sarah's political activities --she helps refugees , for one. They have a common life, against all odds.<br />But everything Pearce believes is about to fall down in the moment when Sarah is murderer in the explosion of a car. His life chages drastically, he becomes more cynical and less sensitive. Years later, he is married again, and running for a position as a Senator, but he has never got over Sarah. While caimpaing he starts seeing her and he wonders if she is really dead.<br />Rather than telling everything by the numbers, Spencer chooses to go back and forth with the chapters, showing how past interferes in the present. His style is very heartfelt and accurate. His particularly choice of word works really good through the novel. I cannot forget to mention the characters: they are quite well developed. Both Sarah and Pearce sound like regular human beings, the kind of people we know, that's what make them believable. Sarah has the rebeliouness of the 60s, and Pearce is the poor man who makes something huge.<br />It is a very interesting book that deserve to be discovered, nevertheless, I don't recommend it to everybody. Many people may not enjoy its particular pace and Sarah's ideas, which can be a bit disturbing at these times we live.	2002-11-15

So, I thought, Nicholas Sparks' novels give all these things. Then I decided to try A Bend in the Road. And it didn't let me down. Plus, it is not stupid. <br />This novel is about losing the one you love and the problems of a starting again. Miles Ryan has never came to terms with the tragic lost of his wife killed in a hit-and-run accident two years ago. He devoted his time to take care of his little son, and to find the person who was driving the car that killed her. His life was nothing but this until the day he meets Sahah Andrews, his son's teacher and they fall for each other. Things are fine until the day something crops up, and put their love in jeopardy.<br />Most of the novel is about how much we can forgive in order to move on. Sometimes, life plays tricks on us and we are supposed to deal with situations we never expected to. This novel shows exactly it. Both Miles and Sarah are supposed to give up things they belive in order to move on. The point Sparks brings up is: can we sacrifice our beliefs for love? Well, you must read the novel to discover why Sarah and Miles have to make sacrifices and if they can make them.<br />To sum up, I had a great time reading this book. As I said this was the love story I wanted to read. A Bend in the Road was my second Sparks book, but, surely, not the last.	2002-11-03

That is impossible. This book has things for all tastes: romance, friendship, betrayal  etc. I have read this book 3 or 4 times and everytime I can find something different, or, even, be surprised. I think it is a wonderful thing how long Louisa May Alcott's masterpiece has been delighing readers everywhere.<br />As everyone knows this is the story of four sisters and their love for each other , but above all, for life. Jo is the most impetuous and she wants to be a writer; Meg wants to get married and be a housewife; Beth, the most sweet, loves helping people; and, Amy wants to be an important person somehow.  Through many years of their lives we learn how they succed --or fail-- in their ambition. <br />Alcott's novel became a paradigma of the condition of American Women during the civil war. Each girl can be seen as a possibility of what women had for their future by that time. Maybe this is why this novel is so timeless. The writer didn't want to make a sociological analysis of that period, but her work is very helpful, once it is quite  reliable as a portrait of that society.<br />This novel deserves to be read over and over again, and not only by little women.	2002-11-03

I've read `Asylum' and `Dr. Haggard's Disease' . The first is a haunting and dark love story --quite different, and very touching--, the second is interesting, however I don't know what happened, but I couldn't click with the book. But `Spider' became my favourite, and it is unforgettable to me.<br />It is a story of man, named Dennis `Spider' Cleg, a man who lives in a kind of halfway house for the mentally ill in London. As he is both protagonist and narrator, we are never sure of what he is talking about. Maybe things happened the way he says, maybe he is alucinating. Who knows? He is a man with mental problems that is followed by the image of his father killing his mother and bringing a whore to substitute for her. And we learn all that happened from Spider's sick mind. Until the surprising end.<br />I highly recommend this novel to readers who like dark thrillers, with psycological undertones. The characters are very well developed. Spider is a human being as any other, we can easily understand what happened to this man that led him to be the way he is.	2002-10-17

I can't come to terms with such a thing. Just because the protagonists are a group of 4 women doesn't mean the novel is only for women read. Men can read `The Saving Graces' and have a lot of fun themselves. As I did.<br />It is a story about a group of four ladies --Emma, Isabel, Lee and Rudy-- who clains themselves The Saving Graces, a group that gets togheter twice a month to talk about their problems, the city's problems, world's issues or whatever subject pops up. Each chapter is narrated by one of them, and it concerns on the narrator's own problems, fears etc.<br />Of course, as many people say, this novel is quite predictable. We can say from page one what will happen in the end, but I don't see it as a problem. I got so interested in the reading, that I even turned a blind on the predictability. And I must confess, I had a lot of fun. I felt happy  when something nice happened to them, and felt like crying when they had to face bad things. I can't say I recommend this novel to everyone. Many people will find it boring and tacky, but I didn't. I think this novel has accomplished its mission with me: entertain me for a couple of days.	2002-10-13
US	49577356	R1E91N9D56KL3I	0380002450	110871072	The Awakening	Books	5	0	0	N	N	It couldn�t be more timeless	Kate Chopin's \\"The Awakening\\" has led to many different response since 1989. Some think this is great and, even, inspirational, others point out that it is silly and meaningless. In my opinion, this is a masterpiece. To truly understand this book, we must look back to when it was first published. Not only was the novel a shock, but also very inspirational throught the years. Many women have done like the protagonist, Edna, and taken their chace to live a better and independent life.<br />The books tells the story of a repressed woman, who lives under the husband opression. She is bored and feels that she has to do something meaningfull with her life. Surrounded by snobish people, Edna feels alone, despite all the `friends' she has. During one summer she is taken aback when she realizes she is in love with one of this people. It takes her a time to come to terms with this, but once she does, her life has a completely new breath. Robert, the man, seems to be more afraid than Edna, and runs away. Edna's solitude only increases her desire of changing her life. Robert's returm may be the event she has always expected.<br />The characters are quite strong and well written, even the supporting ones. Of course Edna is the most developed one, and she faces the same fears of any other human being in any time or place. Perhaps, the men are a bit silly and confused, novertheless realistic. Robert and Mr Pontelier -- the ones who surround  Edna most of the time-- are particularly intriguing: they love her, but can't tell  why. <br />All in all, this is a very interesting novel: both as a character study, and also as a portrait of a period of time.  However, women's condition haven't changed so much as one could expect it to. Many women nowadays face the same feelings, and the conditions that Edna did.	2002-09-29

One may enjoy or not, but will have a strong feeling for it. Some like --or hate -- the plot, others prefer --or can stand-- Eggers's style. It is just a question of taste.<br />As it is widely known AHWOST is about a young who loses his parents in the space of five weeks, and inherits his eight-year-old brother. So in the book he tells the experiece of parenting his little brother and trying to have a own life either.<br />Many parts --mostly the first chapter-- are quite sad, and even scary. However, as the narrative goes on, funny things pop up --nonetheless, important issues, are dealt with the proper seriousness. Ordinary things have a special sparkle. The characters --most, if not all of them-- are based on people Dave knows, and they are very interesting and well-developed. I don't agree with people who says the writer is egocentrial -- or something like it. I think everyone has an interesting story to tell -- some more interesting than others. And it all comes down to put it down in words. If people will read it or not is another problem. Dave did write about his situation, and people liked it.<br />All in all, AHWOSG reminds me of both Chuck Palahniuk and Nick Hornby. Dave shares with Palahniuk an acid view of the world --ses the MTV interview that actually becomes a shrink session. From Hornby he's got the tenderness of dealing with nonsense situations in a smart and funny --without being stupid-- way. Highly recommended.	2002-09-29

It is the story about a `crazy' mother, whose teenage daughter has more sense than her. The woman, Adele, thinks her little girl,  Ann, can make it big in the television, so they move from Wisconsin to California. There, they have a hard life, but for Adele everything is fine. She spends most of the time trying to get a rich husband while Ann spends most of the time hating her.<br />It is hard to find a plot in `Anywhere', actually it is a sequence of situations, with ups and downs. Some chapters are narrated by Ann, others by Lillian (Adele's mother),  and other's by Carol (Adele's sister). Adele's personal speech is showed only in the last section of the novel, when we are really tired of trying to find out who she really is. I understand Mona Simpson's objective with saving Adele for the end, but I wasn't interested  to hear her by that time. I was exhausted.<br />Adele is completely selfish. Maybe in her own, she thinks she is doing all the for good, but she more hurts Ann tha helps her. Maybe we are induced to believe this because Ann tells most of the story. Ann doesn't seem to care that much about their lives, despite all the fought.<br />Anyway, the novel has its funny and interesting moments, but if shorter, it would be better.  There is a movie based on this book, that is quite good, mainly because of Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman's performances as mother and daughter.	2002-09-11

Were it not for its wonderful story, `White Oleander' would be unforgettable by its powerful writing and addictive style. Janet Fitch proves herself to be one of the most competent American writers from late XX Century. Astrid and Ingrid are so well created that we do believe they are real.<br />The novel is coming-of-age story of a teenager whose mother is imprisioned after killing her boyfriend. From this moment on, the narrative bounces between the girl's, Astrid, foster homes, and her new life; and her mother, Ingrid, in jail. These two women must cope with things and people they are not used to. And to make things worse, none of them is prepared to face it. The people they aren't the ones they would choose to be their friends, and it is in this strange world that lies, to me, the most powerful points of the narrative.<br />It seems to me that this book is above all things about adaptation. Everyone  must adapt him/herself in order to survive. It is quite inspiring reading about Astrid's experiences in her foster homes.  All of them has its own universe full of joy and sorrow. The girl must know what she can absorve from each one, because --as everything-- they all have their own flaws.<br />It is easy to notice who Fitch hardly worked every sentence. We can see that she spent a time thinking of the right word for the structure, and this is what makes her work so beautiful, in my opinion.<br />To sum up, this is a wonderful and disturbing novel. Some people may feel very bad after finishing it, due to its strong content. Some will love it, others will hate, but it is impossible not to be indiferent to this novel.	2002-09-01

I liked The Silence... the charactes and situations are well developed and disturbing. On the other hand, I think Hannibal is quite confusing, it reads like it needed to be edited to me. The situations seem to be unfinished, as if Thomas Harris was such a writer that no editor could change his work. That's why I think Hannibal is so over-rated.<br />So when I started reading Dragon I didn't know what to expect from it. It comes out that the result is much closer to Silence. This is when Mr Lecter - everyone's favioute cannibal - first and shortly appears. He is not the main character, he has only a supporting role as a man who helps an agent to find a serial killer, that claims himself to be the Red Dragon, hence the title.<br />The best parts of this novel are those when we are with the Dragon. He is not only fascinating, but very disturbing. It is not scary, but some descriptions are kept in your mind a while after finishing it. There is nothing new when it comes to serial killers. He kills, and Freud will remembered later on, as usuall when we learn why he is the way he is. That's it, most of the wirters seem to have the same explanation to mental disturbs.<br />All in all, to me, Harris is not a great writer, despite having created one of the most famous characters from thrillers, but his style is too simple, and when he wants to sophisticate it becomes confusing and pointless. Hannibal had so many sub-plots and bizare characters that it is pointless. Red Dragon has less characters and the whole story is focused on the killer, what makes the reading interesting and keep the interest up most of the time.	2002-09-01

I'm not talking that it starts in page 289 and chapter 47 and goes to 1. I'm talking about his thematic and the approach he uses to his characters. As in Fight Club nothing here is for sure, his world is sureal, his people outsiders.<br />Survivor is the story of Tender Branson. He is the only survivor of the Creedish Death Cult. He's spent his simple and insignificant live easily. Nor great problems, neither exciting things. He was programmed to work for people as a slave somehow, doing houseworks. His life becomes upside down in the moment he realizes he is the only surviving member of the cult. Along with a woman, who has psychic powers he becomes a celebrity. But expect the unexpected. All in all, this is Palahniuk's world.<br />People who enjoyed his other novel, like Fight Club and Invisible Monsters, will adore this one. Everything is here again: catching plot, an outsider protagonist, smart sentences, quick dialogue. Many people complain that his novels are over and over the same thing. Well, it maybe true, but, in my opinion, it is the same GOOD thing all the time.<br />There is no middle term: either you love, or you hate. And , in my case, the word is love. I feel smart reading his sentences. I feel that he deeply undertands my generation, our fears and expectations. He knows how to put down in word what we like and what we loath, whitout giving a lecture.<br />I can't say I recommed his novels to everyone -- despite I love them. But he is too visceral for some people. To strong for some hearts & stomachs. But people who like him will have a great time with Survivor. It is an easy read, but not easy to forget.	2002-08-11

It is a mix between The Silence of the Lambs -- without such a poweful killer --, a bit of Henry James's early XX Century Fiction -- without too much social analysis --, and a bit of Agatha Christie's murder mistery stories. The Alienist is all of that, and  none of that.<br />Simply cassifying this as a thriller is not enough to be faithful to waht this novel is. The point that makes it differs from, say, The Bone Collector is the setting. Carr's novel could be like any other thriller, but it takes place in the late XIX Century NY, and things were different by that time.<br />Well, not so different. There were young travestites hanging around, and psycho killers --despite not being called as that. The whole book revolves around a serial killer who is murdering male prostitutes. A group of high society people decide to investigate the murders and stop the killing. We must remember that by that time, the forensic techniques were starting to catch on, so most people didn't believed the man murdered by his mental reasons.<br />The title alienist is Dr Lazlo Kreizler who is a friend of a journalist man -- the narrator. They go little by little discovering what happens and why it happens. There are no many clues and they still must face some factions of society who is trying to cover the murders because of its sexual and escandalous content. An there it goes: who is the killer and why.<br />Carr's style is interesting, because he tries not to make a XXI century high speed thriller. And he gets it. Things happen on their own pace. The writing is in slow moting sometimes, what may demotivate the readers --myself included-- in some chapters. Nevertheless, the novel is interesting, mainly because of the well done research about the older forensic thechniques. There are some very graphic passages, but they are not very frequent, despite being desturbing.	2002-08-11

And in this conception, \\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavlier & Clay\\" is a great escapism.<br />Michael Chabon's daring and provocative novel is superb. It is almost impossible to believe that Kavalier, Clay and Rosa are not real people, and that The Escapist has never existed. Some people may go to collectors looking for some old comic books of him, but, unfortunatelly they won't find it. But I don't blame them, the character in the novel is so real that I wish there were comic books for we read.<br />In a nutshell, Sam Clay, n&eacute; Klayman, is a 17 year-old jew who loves pulps. His cousin Kavalier studied drawn and magic before scaping from Nazi-occupied Prague. Togheter in NY they creat the Escapist, a masked hero, who becomes very popular, not only amog teens and children, but also adults, what lead them to another step in comic book creation.<br />Later, a woman come between them. She is Rosa Sacks, a artist somehow, who has a very eccentric father and a very peculiar life. Rosa will play a mayor role when Kavalier falls for her; and so does Clay later, making a love triangle. Much more happens but I'll leave for you find out what reading this novel.<br />Some people say this novel is over-rated, but I don't think so! It's been a long time that I don't read such an interesting and funny prose in such an sophisticated style. I have read Chabon's \\"Wonder Boys\\" and really appreciated. He is one of the best American Writers from the late XX Century/ early XXI. The  themes he tackles in his books are serious and relevant.<br />I have to admit that I didn't enjoy the part that takes place in Antartica as much as the others. That one is a bit hard, nevertheless good once you get why Kavalier is there, and what he is facing. The last part is superb and the ending unique. This is the kind of book that makes us have some hope for literature. Reading Michael Chabon we discover that some writers still have imagination, and love for their art, and they are in the business not only for increasing their bank account, but, for making our lives better.book that makes us have some hope for literature.

She is assigned to work at the Veermer  family's house. At first she is not happy to leave her family to live with strangers and, to make things worse for her, catholics. She does only small things, like going to the market, washing clothes; but her importance increases when she becomes the maid who cleans the room where the painter works. She must clean everything without removing them from their original place. She develops a methode of measuring using hands, arms, and many others parts of her body. With time, she is one of the few people allowed to enter into that room. As we all suspect, she becomes friend of the painter, despite his sense of reservation. This leads them both to events that will change their lives, and many others'.<br />Tracy Chevalier has done a remakable job when writing this novel. It is undeniable that she made a huge ammount of research about not only the painter, but also Dutch life in the XVII Century. She reacreats the set so perfectly that it is impossible not believe that things were the exactly way she describes. The details are impressive: the market, the streets and houses, eveything is exaustive described but that doesn't necessarily mean a boring description. Tracy's writing is alive and colorful.<br />Another point well explored in this novel is Veermer's paintings. While she describes his process of painting, readers can easily picture him setting the scene, preparing to paint, and, even, the painting process itself. Then again, her research about his methods, his material is impressive and very accurate. And Griet is not the only model that comes to life in this novel. Some other paintings done by him in the same period are `explained', and the models become charaters in the novel.<br />The narrative is told by Griet, so she is the character that we know more. She describes her life, family, duty and even a love affair. In her 16 year-old mind, things are seen by a peculiar point of view. Her `text' is easy as it is supposed to be, once she also barely knows how to write. The painter has a very important role in her life. He helps her in her coming of age -- depiste that none of them is aware of it. The painter is a very mysterious character. His family -- mainly wife and kids -- is much more the characterzation than real life people, but I don't think it is a problem, once it is a very young girl who is trying to describe them.<br />As I aforementioned, you don't need to know Veermer, or have seen his paintings, the book is a work of fiction, and can be read as it is. It is a novel about love, courage, fear and rendenption.<br />All in all, reading this book is so enjoyable as seeing the paint.

Anyway, who knows what really happened when Veermer painted \\"The Girl With A Pearl Earring\\"?nly model that comes to life in this novel. Some other paintings done by him in the same period are `explained', and the models become charaters in the novel. <br />The narrative is told by Griet, so she is the character that we know more. She describes her life, family, duty and even a love affair. In her 16 year-old mind, things are seen by a peculiar point of view. Her `text' is easy as it is supposed to be, once she also barely knows how to write. The painter has a very important role in her life. He helps her in her coming of age -- depiste that none of them is aware of it. The painter is a very mysterious character. His family -- mainly wife and kids -- is much more the characterzation than real life people, but I don't think it is a problem, once it is a very young girl who is trying to describe them. <br />As I aforementioned, you don't need to know Veermer, or have seen his paintings, the book is a work of fiction, and can be read as it is. It is a novel about love, courage, fear and rendenption.<br />All in all, reading this book is so enjoyable as seeing the paint. Chevalier's work may not be as close to perfection as Veermer's, but her novel is superb and it amazingly deliveries as a piece of fiction.

US	49577356	R2U8215IF05CFR	0805062971	311054036	Fight Club: A Novel	Books	5	1	1	N	N	I want you to hit me as hard as you can, Mr. Palahniuk	First things first, Chuck Palahniuk is a master when it comes to bring the late 20 Century regular male specimen's psique to the paper -- and the female too, mainly in \\"Invisible Monsters\\". His world is compound of regular people, like us, that in a edgy moment make a slight change and it affects everything. So far, we've seen this in hundreds of books, but his characters, their fears and joys are so unique that he makes me wish writing like him. Or at least be as smart as him. And if you think he is a fluke, try his pos-Fight Club novels, whatever.<br />Personal issues aside, \\"Fight Club\\" is a delightful novel about the nihilism an other feelings of the late 20 century and the prospect of mankind somehow for the 21. The narrator is numb, like many drug addicts he cannot feel new experiences, so he must go to a higher level in order to have his neurotransmissors working. He can't even sleep. Insomnia is not his actual problem, this is just a sympton. The first step is to meet people with terminal diseases in support groups . Later, this doesn't work anymore. His biggest step: Fight Club.<br />Forget all about you've heard about violence. If you think this novel is violent you haven't paid too much attention to the world lately . The violence here is graphic sometimes, but it is not the hardest part for reading.  Nevertheless, it is a scary and painfull experience. It seems to me that FG is one of the best portrait of my generation. The desperate feeling for new things and for getting things harder and harder.<br />From time to time a stunning sentence pops up in the novel. \\"It's your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.\\" \\"(...)Our culture has made us all the same. (...) Indivually, we are nothing.\\" Or \\"I am the toxic waste by-product of God's creation.\\" And many others called my attention. Palahniuk's sentences are very short, but at the same time very effecitve. The periods are also small what makes the reading pretty fast.<br />The movie based on the novel is remarkable, thanks to Jim Uhls' script & David Fincher's dark, smart and unique mise-en-sc&egrave;ne among other things, like Edward Norton's perfect numb nameless narrator & Brad Pitt's subversive and funny Tyler Durden. After seeing the movie, it is impossible to imagine two other actors playing there characters. Despite some different through the narrative and the ending, both --novel and movie-- leave quite the same  feeling in the audience/readers. The result is the same.<br />I don't recommend reading --or watching -- \\"Fight Club\\" to everybody. It tackles subjects that are too hard to some people, like self-improvement -- self-destruction --, terminal diseases and \\"Michief. Mayhem. Soap.\\", as the cover says. But those who dare to step into the fight club will not regret. You may not like it, but you won't be indifferent to it.<br />In the end it feels like you've spent your whole Saturday night in the Fight Club, and you can't hardly wait for the next weekend. Like Tyler says to the narrator, you'll say \\"I want you to hit me as hard as you can, Mr. Palahniuk\\". And hopefully he will do so with another amazing book.el is remarkable, thanks to Jim Uhls' script & David Fincher's dark, smart and unique mise-en-scène among other things, like Edward Norton's perfect numb nameless narrator & Brad Pitt's subversive and funny Tyler Durden.

It surely has it admirers and its haters  -- and it is not a surprise due to its explosive, realistic and trashy material.<br />Jacqueline Susann's novel tells the story of three wannabe stars through a period of 20 years. So there are up and downs in their careers and personal lives. And when I say up I really mean the highest up possible, and down... well, their down is the lowest possible:  in the `valley of the dolls'.<br />Jackie wrote as who knew the cause. She herself was a starlet in Broadway in the 50's and did some TV later, but she never made the stardom until she became a writer. And fame was all she wanted all the time. She could tell all the excentricities and disfunctions of stars because she lived with it for years. In front of the public: the glamour; in the backstage: fights, arguing, drugs and a lot of sex.<br />The characters are quite interesting and intruguish in this novel. The trio of protagonists, Anne, Neely and Jennifer are the best developed ones, but the supporting ones are very believable too. It is impossible to deny that Jacqueline knew the female soul very good, so her women are much more active and alive than her men. All three girls pass through a self discovery journey whose results are not good, and become addicted to pills-- a.k.a. dolls, hence the title.<br />Despite the subject, it is not a serious or depressive book. You will find yourself laughing out loud in some moments -- even though Jackie's intention wasn't to make you laugh.<br />Another interesting point in the novel is that it traces a realistic painel of the show biz in the 40's, 50's and 60's. The novel brings up themes like the rise and fall of the studio system, the 3 picture deals, the substituition of the radio and cinema by the TV, the adaptation of the actors face the new media. This kind of things is between the lines sometimes, but sometimes it is very explicit.<br />I highly recommend this novel to everyone who wants to have some fun and read about a crazy time. All in all, \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" may not be a great piece of literature, but it is a great piece of escapism; and sometimes, that is more than enough.br />I highly recommend this novel to everyone who wants to have some fun and read about a crazy time.

US	49577356	ROWTM0UDWP2HQ	0451525264	996904481	Les Miserables	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Miserable Bodies, Rich Souls	People tend to be very afraid of reading classic novels, mostly when it comes to French Classic Auteurs, such as Victor Hugo. So was I! It took me years until I had all the courage to pick this book from the shelf. Anyway, now, that I have finished I noticed it is not a monster. On the contrary, it is much closer to the novels I usually read than I was expecting. Of course, Victor's language is complicated and it requires all the reader's attention.<br />\\"Les Mis&eacute;rables\\" tell the famous story of the ex-con Jean Valjean, and his journey to rendempetion that took him many years. In a nutshell the plot is widely known, but only by reading Hugo's lines that one can get the richness of his speech and the profundity of his story.<br />The story may be quite interesting and catching, but it is involuntarily funny. To me there were too many coincidences happening all the time. The characters are so good that we don't usually see people like them around. Others suffer so much, that you doubt they are human beings. As a matter of fact, some of should wear halos over their heads; but, anyway, this may be the way Hugo found to show the hypocrisy of his society.<br />Don't get me wrong, it is a great novel, but it has funny things. For one, Javert and Valjean run into each other too much. In a big city, this wouldn't happen so frequently. On the other hand, Hugo's panorama of the Napolionic France is quite good and reliable. Moreover, his battle sequences are very vivid and  believable.<br />In the end, we notice that is much worse having a miserable soul, than a miserable body, and then we can notice an inversion: the characters who are fisically miserable, are the ones who have the best heart and soul. All in all, this is the kind of novel that can be very inspiring to some people, and that is not a bad thing. To me it was just a great novel, unfortunatelly. Very above the avarege but still only a novel.	2002-05-05

It is the kind of book that when finished you ask \\"What is the point?\\", and this is a question that should never be asked to any work of literature -- or any other kind of art.<br />Due to the fact that Ramus himself was a marchand, the novel has many points close to reality -- anyway, he knows how this world works; but what could be a dark trip to the underworld of art becomes a cold thriller. The characters are very one demensioned: the good guys, the bad guys -- and there are also some undercover people, but you can easily discover them. The protagonist Adrian Sellars is the over-clich&eacute;d idea of bad-guy-cum-good-guy looking for rendemption. He solve his problems to easily. Life has been to good to him, as a matter of fact. He is rich, but he owns millions to other art dealers; he has money to buy everything he needs, but we never know where it comes from, once he uses the only money he has in the beginning of the novel to buy drugs. Add to him the lovable and shallow Devon, a very rich girl who happens to be his secretary... why? Because the author wants her to be, this is the only explanation. The Japanese Mafia is very caricatured. Their moral code in Ramus's hands become a simple reverence-killing-reverence-hummiliation and strange guys in expensive suits.<br />His style of writing is the simplest possible, and you can point out how the end will be after reading 100 pages. There is no twist that makes you hold your breath and the ending... well, it is what you got in your mind. This book is definetily a page turner, because it is easy and it doesn't require too much of your mind, just read to spend your time; or read \\"Thief of Light\\" between two hard books in order to refresh your mind, but don't expect something deep or provoking . Another thing: I wish I could give 2 ½ and not 3.	2002-04-23

The novel reads like a mix between Austen countryside prose and Wilde's cinism and desbilef, that made the book very interesting, but, on the hand, its characters are very shallow and monodimensional.<br />When Flora losts her parents, she seeks any relative who can support her. The only family who accepts the girl are the Starkadder, who happen to live in the Cold Comfort Farm, hence the title. They are quite a family. Any of them has his/her problems, limitation and interests. Flora goes to live with than and she [can you guess?] changes everybody's lives, even the farm's.<br />Gibbons's prose is fluent and interesting. The story, despite its previsibility, keeps the reader interested. The characters, as I aforementioned, are very monodimensional, ie, they are more types the human beings, like, the Sad Aunt, the Naive Cousin.... nevertheless, they are good to spend some hours with. Flora, the protagonist, is the more interesting, but and she suffers some changer through the narrative, but very smoothy ones. In the end, she is not very different from the girl she is the begining.<br />The title is very interesting and self-explianable: in that farm, Flora finds some comfort, but this is still a cold place due to the weird people that live there. The farm can be read as a metaphor of the world and the some kind of people one may find, but even then, the author is a bit naive. Her world is too easy to live and the problems too easy to solve. Real life is a bit different.<br />All in all, it is a funny reading. Despite being a bit of Austen and a bit of Wilde, this novel isn't close to any of their work. Anyway, it is worth reading for people who like an easy and sometimes interesting prose.	2002-04-13

Novel after novel, le Carr&eacute; proves to be the best writer when it comes to spy stories mixed with political thrillers. And this novel is no exception in his work.<br />With the end of the USSR, a great lack of political ideology dominates Europe. The new countries created from the breaking of the potence started their own politics and their own rules against the rest of the world. This is the set of `Our Game', when we meet Mr. Cranmer, a retired spy, who is trying to locate a friend, Larry, who happens to be very ideological, even fanatic for politics. We are invited to go with Tim Cranmer in this dangerous journey, where everyting is risky. To make things worse, Larry and Tim, who has been friends for many time, have shared a woman, Emma, who is now playing some dangerous political games either. This bizarre love triangle is the main motivation of the novel most of the time -- but, of course, with many political and spy backgrounds.<br />The best character in the novel is Tim, who is also the narrator. So we see everyting through his eyes, what makes the clues we have very dubious, once is a spy and is trainned to deceive. Is he deceving us? Nothing is free from his peculiar point of view. All his actions and thoughts have a meaning and are important in the novel. Larry is also very well developed, but we learn little by little how he became who he is. This is something that really grabs the reader's attention, because it is very well written and always lets us wanting more. I agree with a reviewer who says we should know a bit more about Emma. She is not shallow at all, but she is such an interesting character that I was left with the feeling that I wish I knew more about her and her past. Anyway, she makes sense in the narrative, and she is a main piece in this game.<br />Le Carr&eacute; has a very nice style. His writing is not difficult, but it requires the reader's total attention to the details. There are many flash backs that come out of the blue sometimes, but they aren't boring, nor break the rhythm of the narrative. I highly recommend this novel to eveyone who likes a very interesting spy book.flash backs that come out of the blue sometimes, but they aren't boring, nor break the rhythm of the narrative.

After finishing \\"The Color Purple\\" I still have those characters in my mind and think of them.<br />In a nutshell, it is an epistolary novel about two black sister who have been apart from many years. In these letters, some addressed to God and some from one sister to the other, they talk about their lives, and at the same time the draw a huge picture of the condition of black people during some years of the XX Century. Most letters are written by Celie, the sister who is sold to man, after being raped by her father. In her life, she has never had any kind of pleausure until she meets Shug, a singer and devoted passion of her husband. After living a time with Shug, they become friends, and this friendship will lead both of them to take never-imagined huge steeps in ther lives.<br />Most we learn comes from  Celie's point of view, and it is fascinating to see her opinion about many things changing through the novel and her life as well. To me, one of the most dramatic changes is the way she thinks of God, and after it, she is ready to take new a daring paths in her life.<br />Alice Walker's style is complex and demanding. Her use of Language is very impressive, once she reproduces Celie's writting. At first it reads a bit difficult, but once you get in, it is impossible not to fall for Celie's hope, courage and innocence. Nettie's letter that arrive in the middle of the novel give a new breath to the narrative. They show another perspective of a black woman's life. She is a missionare and goes to Africa.<br />The novel tackles it genuinely important subjests, like racism, fear, male domination and female submission, African native costumes against European and American ways of lives. But the strongest theme in this novel is the racism -- or better saying how much of descrimination a black woman has to face, even from black people.<br />To finish, I see Celie, Nettie, Shug and Sofia the same personna. They all represente different perspectives of Celie -- or the black woman's condition in general. Shug is the happiness, the arts; Nettie means the African roots, the political conscience; and Sofia is the physical strengh that one has to use sometimes in order to deal with some problems. `The Color Purple' is not only purple, but as colorful as a rainbow when it comes to characters, deep of situations and writing; and it is a book that must be discovered more and more by everybody.ente different perspectives of Celie -- or the black woman's condition in general.

Everybody -- even those who haven't seen the movie -- has seen the shower sequence. So that's why Robert Bloch's novel won't surprise many people. The film is the filmed novel. There are no virtual differences in the story, despite some changes in the order it is told.<br />Smartly Hitchcock started the movie with Mary Crane, instead of with Norman Bates, as in the novel. Using this resourse, he made the audience feel sympathetic for her and get interested in the movie -- something that probably wouldn't happen if Norman'd been the first contact the audience had. Whe the film begin, we develop feelings for her and star rooting for her plan work. Almost in the middle when we are introduced to Mr Bates, we'd already been with Mary for too long. When she is murdered the audience is left like an orphan, once their heroine is dead and they have no one to root for any more. Nobody expects the protagonist get murder in the middle of the film.<br />... Nowadays, as I mentioned, everybody knows at least a bit of the story, so hadly does it surprise the reader/viewer, but by that time, when the novel started to catch on the story was very frigthening.<br />To sum up, if you are looking for some more explanations, about Norman or his condition don't expect the novel to answer your questions. It is very descriptive, but it is not giving you answers. It is worth reading to learn a bit more about Norman et al, but don't expect a surprise ending.	2002-03-23

It is the story of a prosecutor who is accused of murdering a work mate and ex-lover.<br />Most of the novel can be classified as courtroom drama, and this is the most effective part of the story, despite being a bit boring sometimes. The book is divided in three parts. In the first Scott Turow sets the story, presents the characters and the crime. The second, the longest one, is the judgement, and the third, a conclusion with some moral undertones.<br />Turow has an easy reading style. He seems to know a lot about laws, lawyers and their underworld, and he can perfectly translate it to people who is not used to it. The only problem I had with his narrative were the flashbacks. Sometimes he stops in the middle of an event in order to move years back to tell something that in end is not important in the present time. This regression really bothered me sometimes.<br />The main character, Rusty, is interesting but not great or unforgettable. I think Turow wanted to show what happens when a man who knows the law is accused of crime that he might -- or might not -- have commited. His main objective was showing a man who can manipulate the law, and prove himself innocent dispite comminting the crime -- or how the prosecutors can use this device in order to incriminate an innocent man. These questions are at the centre of the narrative, but to me, I could never believe that Rusty could  have killed Carolyn, so half of the story sunk to me. The other characters are a bit caricatured and shallow. They work more like human types rather than human beings, i.e. they are the enemy who can do anything to get a position he wants, the betrayed wife, the good lawyer, the fair and sympathetic judge...<br />`Presumed Innocent' is not a page-turner. The false hints through the novel distracts the reader rather than creating a surprise in the end. This novel demands time and paciency from the reader. It rises some interesting moral questions, but they get lost through the middle of the novel, and in the end, some people may find theirselves asking `what is the point?'er, the fair and sympathetic judge... <br />`Presumed Innocent' is not a page-turner.

He's been hunted by another professional killer. And he hasn't the slighest clue of whom he is. This is Jason Bourne -- or not.<br />Robert Ludlum's \\" The Bourne Identity\\" is already a classic thriller. This is the first instalment of the Bourne's serie and as many other series, you have to read all the books to really reach the end of the story. I mean, this novel has an ending, but it is very open, and many mysteries remain unsolved so far.<br />Of course the most developed character here is the man named Jason Bourne. It is interesting to see how he discoveries his potential identity little by little -- and brings up many other questions about himself. And as it should be, he is very afraid to find out who he is, because he may not be a good person. The other important character is Marie St. Jacques who is not as well written as Bourne. Sometimes she lacks in credibility, but it doesn't jeopardize the reading.<br />Some people may complain this novel is very dated: the actions happen in the mid 70's and geopolitics has an important role through the action. But it seems to me that only by that time such story would happen. Nowadays, the world is so different and tecnology much more developed that would make Bourne think and act in  different ways.<br />I think the film version of this novel --starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente --that is about to be realesed is quite different from the material source, adding characters, events and maybe updating the story. We have to wait to see it. Anyway, I highly recomend this page-turner  for those who wants to read some action and mystery.	2002-03-13
US	49577356	R17FX4JG0NVJ9P	0679735909	627682796	Possession	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Impossible not to be Possessed	Read A.S. Byatt's `Possession' is one of the highest challanges a reader can face. The novel is wonderful, but very demanding, not only because its length but also its structure. I had to read it twice in order to get better all the references and magic of Byatt's work and I still have the feeling that I'm missing many things.<br />To put in a nutshell the novel is the story of two British academics, who study two late poets Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte. After finding some never seen letters of these writers, the scholars discover a secret love affair between the poets and start to investigate it and its consequence their lives and works. It is hard to classify this novel: it is part a drama, part a thriller and much of an analyze of the sexual behaviour of the Victorian Era and the `80s.<br />To begin with the title, the word `possesion' allows many interpretations related to the novel. One of the academics, Roland, who is the first to find and steal Ash's letters says he was possessed when he did it. Another good explanation is that he and the other academic. Maud, are so `possessed' by the late poets that they revive the love affair. Or the word `possession' refers to love itself: being in love is being possessed by some unknown entity. Ash says many times he was possessed by something he didn't know when in love with LaMotte. Possession may also be related to the obsession that all the academics can have to their object of study. All of them in the novel go deeper in the poets' lives than in their own, mainly Croppe. There are some other explanation that anyone can come up with after reading the novel. All of them can be right, all can be wrong.<br />As a modern work as it is, `Possession' allows many interpretations and conclusion. Byatt's wrtinting is very semitotic: everything is related to everything. Acts from the past still have effect in the present time. Things that the poets did in the XIX century, interferes in the life of people in the late XX.<br />Another effective technique used by the author is the interrelationship of verse and prose. More than creating two characters who are poets, Byatt created their work. One can read many verses and tales written by these poets through the novel, and their meaning and  importance are in a higher level. Their works are clues to understand their lives and their affair. And, yes, Byatt is this good. She can created verses as good as her prose and so different that one may doubt they were written by the same person. By the way, these kind of writing reads a bit hard at first, but once you get uesd to it, it is very pleasant to have many different sources as poems and letters than the plain narrative as usuall. The poets' letters are very vivid and beautiful, it is impossible not to be touched by their relationship and feel sorry for all the problems they have to face.<br />The comtemporany characters are very well developed also. Roland and Maud are the ones who face the most drastically change. Not only all the work they have developed about Ash and LaMotte have to change, but also their own private lives faces a challenge. The other three main academics, Croppe, Leonora and Blackadder, also see their working falling down. These characters are very realistic: it is not hard to find people who spent their whole lives devoted to study one single subject that they become obsessed to it.<br />Byatt's prose is insightfull and discriptive. Colours have an mayor role through the narrative. She uses many shades of colours just to give to the reader the right feeling of the moment, particularly  green, that seems to be associated to the female pole of the novel. The sexual tension between the characters is very subtle. The differences between the Victiorians and the XX Century people is very thin, although we think we can point it out easily. Byatt's shows we still share some of the same doubts and fears that were so common in the other century.<br />All in all, `Possession' is possessive. It is impossible not to fall for Byatt's writing and characters. After finishing the novel you got the actuall sense you've read a true story. It is impossible to believe that Ash and LaMotte have never been alive and lived that deep love affair.Possession' is possessive. It is impossible not to fall for Byatt's writing and characters.

Much more are the four ladies --who have been friends for over 50 years--, the protagonists of this wonderful novel.  Many people claim this to be a `chick novel', but I don't agree with them. It may talk much more about the female universe than the male, but it is worth reading by any person who likes reading about friendship, love, family and all these crazy things that we have in life.<br />Siddalee Walker has never had a very easy relationship with her mother. But things got much worse when in an interview to The New York Times she refers to her mother as a `child abuser'. Vivi, the mommy, refuses to talk to her anymore. When Sidda starts working on a stage prodution about female frendishp, she  asks her mother's help and she receives a scrapbook called \\"Divine Secrets of The Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\". Through this book she will learn how her mother's life has been since when Vivi was a little girl and met her 3 Ya-Ya friends. Needless to say that Sidda's life will never be the same again.<br />The novel has two distintc poles: Siddalee's life and Vivi's life. And the reader can notice that although both lives seem to be different at first, both mother and daughter share much more in common than they would ever imagine. Vivi's life is told by her book, by letters, by the three other Ya-Yas, by memories... These many points of views and resources used by Rebecca Wells only enhance the reading, making it be easier and much more interesting than if there was a single narrator.<br />By the way, Rebecca Wells has created some of the most `vivid' -- according to Sidda, this word comes from her mother's name -- female characters of contemporany literature. Her four Ya-Yas are irrepressible. They are normal people like us, trying to make their lives a better place to live in. Sidda can be any woman anywhere. She shares the same fears and joys of women have been facing ever since. This novel is dominated by female characters, but the few men who show up are also very interesting and well developed.<br />The text is funny and lyrical, but be ready, you may need some tissues sometimes. My advice is: read this novel and learn a bit about friendship, loyalt, love and other things that make life worth living. This is a wonderful book, that should be read by everyone.the few men who show up are also very interesting and well developed. <br />The text is funny and lyrical, but be ready, you may need some tissues sometimes.

His works are in the same level of Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Harmmet. His prose has a by flying style and appeal that make almost impossible to put down any of his books once you had started.<br />I have to admmit that I'd watched \\"L. A. Confidential\\" dozen times before reading the novel -- and it is something I don't usually do , I mean I prefer reading the novel before watching a movie. So my work was a bit easier, because I didn't need to picture the characters, I imagined the actors who played them in the movie. But, as my reading went on and on, I noticed how different -- and equally good the novel and the film are.<br />The novel focuses on the life of three officers of PDLA through seven years. They are Bud White, Jack Vincennes and Ed Exley. And there are hundreds of suporting characters that help to show how these guys went up and down in their carrers.<br />It is almost impossible to put this novel in a nutshell due to fact it has so many plots, sub-plots and important twist through the story that it would be impossible to tell them without taking away the surprise of who hadn't read the book yet.<br />Ellroy is really good in character developing. All of them have a past -- and most of them very obscure-- with interesting facts that also have some relation in their present time. Moreover, they are very psychologically believable.<br />LA has never looked so glamurous and so scary! In this city everyone is an angel, but also a little devil. This is the perfect city where any noir story fits.<br />When it comes to the movie, the script written by Curtins Hanson and Brian Hellgland is very smart. Many scriptwriters could have fallen into the trap of trying to translate the whole novel to the screen. Such a thing would be very complicated and the film would result in a mess. In the book, many characters and plots work very fine once the readers can move back and forward according to their needs. But in the movie -- once you are in a theatre-- you have to follow what is in the screen, so if you missed an important line, you can miss the whole movie.<br />More than adaptating everything, they took L.A. Confidential's premisse and worked on their very own story, although it has many things inspired by the novel. They left out many sub-plots and created another ones, that make the story more watchable and interesting. But, they never lost the Ellroy's appeal.<br />All in all, both novel and movie are great, and they should be experienced by everyone, once they are two different works that complete each other.needs.

US	49577356	R2ZU6ZSI6NPFQ8	0679741933	977039001	The Wild Palms	Books	4	6	9	N	N	Wild Loves	I have to confess that it took me two years to finish reading this book, that includes two novel. But it was worth reading. The two stories are very deep and touching.<br />The stories told in alternated chapters are about love, resignation and dedication. `Wild Palms' is about two lovers who dare to have a very deep and selfless relationship that leads them to madness and death. The other is called  `Old Man' and it is about a convict that saves a woman from a flood, but it means much more, it is all about maternity and the old battle of Men against Nature.<br />I like most `Wild Palms', but it doens't mean I didn't like the other novel. But Palms somehow pushed some buttons inside me. Many people complain this novel is too obvious, and after the second chapter you can predict things that will happens to the lovers in the end. Well, it can be so somehow, but what I think it is more importante here is how far they go and how they take their love affair so serious and passionate. Charlotte and Wilbourne are very brave . When reading I could see the tragic result of their love, but one cannot imagine what leads the to such an ending. `Old Man' also is about love, but a different kind. In this novel, the river is one of the main characters, subjugating men, but also meaning free will.<br />All in all, it is a very dense novel, that tackles both about bizarre and lyrical sides of life. I don't think it is a kind of book for everyone, due to its difficult and deep subject, but some people will delight with Faulner's words.	2002-02-05

This is the expression that best describes Dolores Claiborne's life, the title character of this Stephen King's novel. Told in flashback by her to some investigators we learn little by little what  has led her to jail.<br />Dolores's life has never been easy or even nice. Living beyond the shadow of an alkie and mean husband, she could never experience true love and the only thing she does is working. But to make things worse, she happens to have a job at Vera Donovan's summertime house in Little Tall Island in Maine. Vera is known for being repulsive and extremely snobish. But Dolores, who is very brave and not afraid of working, doesn't mind having this job as long as she can save some money to her three kids go to a college. When she discoveries that her husband is doing not so good stuff to their teen daughter Dolores promisses revenge. One day when a Solar Eclipse is coming, Vera gives her some tips that will led Dolores to do things that will change her life forever.<br />This novel is almost a flew over the cuckoo's nest in King's work, but don't be fooled, only those who know just a little about his work would be surprised by this one. Everthing that is so characteristic of his novels is here: character development, a crucial non-returnable point in their lives, and some very unpredictable turns. Some very bad things happens to Dolores, and she does not have telekinectic powers, just like Carrie to help her to solve the problems, so she has to fix things with her own hands.<br />It seems to me that the eclipse that happens in the middle of the novel has a very metaphorical meaning. When the night comes in the middle of the day, people change, they feel freer, they can do things they wouldn't be able to do with the Sunlight or, even, the Moonlight. The complete darkness seem to cover things.<br />I don't think this is King's best work -- `The Shinning' is much better --, but, anyway, it is a very nice and disturbing novel. The only problem is that it is not divided into chapters or blocks, and this difficults the reading. I understood why he did it -- the whole novel is Dolores's mologue, her confessions --, but we cannot read everthing in one sitting, so it is hard to decide where to stop avoiding missing what we have reading so far. Sometimes you are able to track points when she is moving to a different subject that helps a lot.<br />All in all, it is an interesting novel. And it shows how cruel human beings can be, and what some people make in order to survive.

When it comes to \\"Out Of Africa\\", it seems that in the whole book Karen Blixen -- aka Isak Dinesen or Tania Blixen or Pierre Andrezel -- is trying to come to terms with the lost of her farm in Nariobi.<br />In my opinion, the last part is the most important a nd I had the feeling that all the others are a preparation for what would happen. The novel bounces between naive humor and native costumes in Africa. It is very clear that the writer is deeply in love with the continent, so it is not possible to have an anlytical approach to the subjet. But, of course, we have to keep in mind that she is telling us part of her live, so who would be able to be analytical ? the writing is nice, but sometimes heavy and boring. It came a time while  reading that I had the feeling I was `reading' in circles -- I mean it seemed that I'd been reading the same thing over and over again. But I think I could see her point: she wants to tell the more experiences and life in Africa she can. I liked the first pages vey much, they are very lyrical and funny somehow, but after a time all these things become boring and very hard to be followed.<br />Anyway, the book can be read as a prortrait of the portrait of the colonialism in Africa and its impact on natives's lives. But I wonder how accurate it is. We cannot forget that the story is told by an European's point of view, and many times she addmits not undertanding many costumes of the natives.<br />However, I cannot forget to mention the high points of the book. It is very admirable to see a woman living and managing a farm by herslf in such a hostile continent. It is very interesting to see how she tackle with so many problems that crop up.<br />All in all, it is not the kind of reading for eveybody. Many people may find hard to follow it, once there is no plot, nor actually a story, but many memories which are much more linked by their subject than by the chronology.people may find hard to follow it, once there is no plot, nor actually a story, but many memories which are much more linked by their subject than by the chronology.	2002-01-25

Surely they are a kind of bloodsuckers, but they don't match the steriotypical concept of vampires, such as Count Dracula, Nosferatu, Lestat and his peers.<br />\\"The Hunger\\" is the story of Miriam a creature who has been living for thousands of years and creating lovers from time to time. Mostly of the action happens in the late XX century while she gets in touch with a scientist called Sarah Roberts, who is working on sleeping disturbs and aging experiments  As the novel goes on Miriam and Sarah get more and more involved -- phisically, mentally and even sexually. The results of this union can be nothing but tragic.<br />I have read many vampire novels and seen a lot of movies. And all of them seem to have their own peculiarities. In this book, as it was aforementioned, the creatures here aren't really vampires. The don't have fangs, so they must used a knif or something alike in order to reach their victims' blood, but Miriam, who is a natural born bloodsucker, has got a special tongue that allows her to cut and then suck the blood. Plus, they don't need to hide from the Sun and only fire can kill them.<br />In my opinion, the novel is very entertaining, but it misses some details. For instance, it kept me wondering where these creatures come from. Miriam is born in this way, and she has been sucking blood ever since. But, if the person stop aging in the moment he/she is transformed, how could she grow up?  Moreover, she is said to be 30 so did she grow up until adult age and stoped aging? There are some points that really aren't very clear to me. I also wanted to know much more about her life in ancient times, like in Rome, Greece, Egypt. Another point that isn't very clear to me is when Tom is at Miriam's trying to save Sarah, what really happens? What did John do? It is no more mentioned later, so I could not be sure of what had gone on.<br />Whitley Strieber is very able to mix styles, which is a pro for the book. He can floats between fantasy and sci-fi in a turn of page, although it gets a bit annoying after a time, when the narrative becomes much more sci-fi than fantasy. While reading this novel I tried to think of it in a higher level. Maybe it was metaphor somehow, but I couldn't come up with something yet.<br />All in all, perhaps I am too addicted to Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles to appreciate other kind of bloodsuckers. Some instalments of her work are much better than this one. I also missed some gothic details and dark events in this novel. But anyway, it is a very interesting reading for whose who enjoy the subject. The film version is very good.

Now, after finishing my reading, I love film much more, but I didn't like the novel very much.<br />In my opinion, Arthur C. Clarke's work has  much more details and gives away many subtle nuances of the film. Everthing that kept me thinking about for days when I first saw the picture was easily `solved' in the novel. I mean, he explains -- or at least tries to -- everthing we saw in the picture. Opposite to the film also, there are many, many dialogues, and  some solutions  that shouldn't be given to the reader, once he/she could come up with his/her own interpretation. In the novel things are very clear and not so much dubious. It seems to me that many things Kubrick tried to hide in order to make us think about, Clarke just give them facts and figures. It took way all the magic that the movie had created in my mind. If I haven't had watched \\"2001...\\" once, I would think this novel was terrific. But, as I said, I have watched this movies dozen times.<br />Moreover, Clark's way of writing is a bit boring and sometimes it seemed to me that he was treating me like child -- as when we explaing abstract concepts to little children. Bowman is a bit shallow as a character, he seems not to have many inner conflicts, what really makes charaters interesting and worthy to carry for. I thought really boring  a chapter where the auhor writes about the different theories about E.T.s, and I didn't think it read at least intesting. In some parts of the novel, the writer makes us feel that scentists and astronuasts are a kind of blessed human beings, much better than us, ordinary people. [But maybe it is just me!!]<br />Anyway, it can be an interesting reading mainly if you compare what they expected the world to be in the year 2001 and -- now that this year is over, we already are in 2002-- how the world, people and science were. The are much more errors than guesses when it comes to Clarke's `predictions'. For instance, the greatest one is we haven't been living, colonizing or exploring planets in the way they mention in 2001. Space Travels are not as easy and common as in the novel. I also think the writer reads a bit naive when talking about living in other planets. According to his writings, there seemed to be no war or fights between nations for discorvered lands. I think when mankind will be able to live and colonize another planets there will be wars -- just like in past centuries when Africa was being colonized. He also mention URSS, but it's been many years that this union has been dissolved. Of course, when this novel was written the world was living beyond the shadow of the Cold War, and the writer hadn't imagined that I might have ended in the 90's as well as the end of URSS. On the other hand, he is right about people being able to exchange information via computers. [Although computers are not as smart as HAL 9000] Many times in the novel, the astronauts read newspaper in a computer screen -- ie the Internet, albeit it was not possible to Clarke predict that this would be the net's name.<br />The part I like most in the novel is the first one; the one about the pre human beings. It made many points clearer because I could read what was going on inside their minds-- something we can not be sure in the movie. I also appreciated the ending. Not only does the author explain about the star child -- a bit frustrating --, but he also goes a bit further with a little pessimistic event -- very creepy!<br />All in all, it is not a bad novel, but I think it misses a lot when compared to the movie. I'm not a sci-fi geek, but I could understand most of the language used in the story, so this will not be a problem for those who intend to read it and don't understand scientific language.

It's widely known that the life of the main character, Charles Strickland, is based on some events of the life of the painter Paul Gaugin. However, it's not closely to be a byographical work, actually, it is good work of fiction.<br />The narrative can be divided in three distinguishing parts. In the first one, we are introduced to narrator, Strickland and his family, and some friends. In this section of the novel, the painter is not a painter yet, and he has an ordinary and boring life with his wife and kids. Although we can notice he is not a happy man, we never got a slightest clue of he is about to do. Charlie appears only in a couple of paragraphs of this part, and we learn much more about him through other people's comments. The second part stars with a surprise when he escapes to Paris and his wife ask the narrator to help her. That's when we see much more about Charlie. It's discovered that all he wants is to get down to painting. It's the largest part of the novel and this when the most important events of Strckland's life happen, and this will influence his art forever. The last part is very interesting, because it is when the narrator is no longer in touch with the painter and everything he learns about him -- and so do we -- is through the people who had lived with Charlie in the Tahiti.<br />This novel may not be Maugahm's masterpice, but on the other hand it is a very good reading. I think the the whole novel comes down to following a dream. Many times near the end, the writer makes it very clear. Mainly when he tells a woman a story of a doctor who could have got everything he wanted but he chose living in a far and poor place, because it satisfied hismelf much more. This is the same thing that happens to our hero. He spent most his time in a tasteless and senless family life in London. He was almost 40 when he gave everthing up in order to fullfill his feelings. Nobody understand why he did so, but as he said all the time, he didn't give a damn to what people thought or said about him.<br />All in all, this novel I had the feeling that Charles Strickland was a desperate soul in search of rendemption, and he only got it after quiting his meaningless life and seaching for his own sense of life.his feelings.

It's a very strange novel that already shows some of his main themes, such as a clash between American and British -- or European -- culture and moral, but it lacks character development and in psychological  analysis .<br />The main characters, the Europeans, Eugenia and Felix are  weird, and I could never get them across. All acts of them seem to come out of the blue, and nothing they do seems to be justified. Maybe I was expecting a couple of sinical and looking-for-money people, but what I got was two boring people. All the time I had the feeling that they came to America in order to make profitable marriages, but it was never confirmed. Felix's marriage to Gertrudes is silly and I was not convinced that he loves her; he does nothing but laughing and painting all the time. And Eugenia affair with Robert is so quick and meaningless. Why does she not marry him? It's never really explained.<br />I see it could have been a better novel if it was writen by a more experienced Henry James. There are many points that want to be developed but -- I don't know why -- the writer just left them with an easy solution. Many events could have gone a bit further, such as Clifford's crush on Eugenia, or Brand's love for Gertrudes, or even the relationship between Eugenia and Robert Acton.<br />Please don't get me wrong! I like James's works very much, but I couldn't connect to this novel. It didn't make me care for the characters or what happens to them. Moreover, the marriages that happen in the very last pages of the book sounded very meaningless, or something like &quot; let's give a happy end&quot;. Anyway, it is a nice book to start reading Henry James, but move on afterwards. I mean, no matter how hard &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot;, &quot; The Portrait of a Lady&quot; or &quot;Golden Bowl&quot; can be, read them, so that one can  fully get James's style and greatness.mes's style and greatness.	2001-12-26

Even though the novel was written almost a  hundred years ago, it is still very suitable for this XXI Century. It seems to me that the story is all about the different moral and background that every class of the society had by that time, and the consequences of it during their lives.<br />The main characters are the two Schlegel Sisters, Margaret and Helen, who are keen on arts, books, philosophy, feminism and other things that have a relation with the soul and the thought. After a misfortunated love affair between Helen and the Paul Wilcox, whose parents they met in a trip to German, their lives change forever. Magaret becomes a close friend to Mrs Wilcox, and her sister starts to despise the family. When Ruth Wilcox dies, she leaves Howads End to her friend, but the Wilcoxes feel betrayed and don't follow up the lady's last will. Years later, Mr Wilcox marries Margaret, and in the very end of the book, after a serie of extremely unpleasant events he tells her that Howards End belongs to her.<br />This brief summary I've just done misses a lot in details and the feeling that anyone only gets reading the novel. There are so many brilliant and subtle nuances in Forster's work. His works bounces from comedy to tragedy in a turn of page. I burst out laughing the first time Helen meets Mrs Bast -- a.k.a.Mrs Lanoline. Sometimes, many things are just left between the lines. For instance, I doubt whether Henry Wilcox feels anything for Margaret but guilt for not telling her about his wife's last will. Personaly speaking, I think he likes and respects her but does not love her until when Charles is arrested, that is when he falls apart, and she is there helping him.<br />As I was saying, I see the whole story as clash between the different cultures that each character have .  The Schlegels may feel very confortable in the XX Century. They are very open minded, enjoy discussing, and were not afraid of showing what they think or fell. On the other hand, the Wilcoxes are very worried about social position and not used to letting women express themselves. And to represent the lowest classes are the Bast : Leonard and Jackie. He likes arts and books, but his older wife prefers the joys of the world - and Mr Wilcox used to know it years ago.<br />The prose is so alive that sometimes I felt extremely agry with some characters, mainly Charles- the oldes Wilcox boy. He is so snobbish, self-centred and xenophibic. For instance, he doesn't face up the fact to that he's killed Mr Bast and after telling the event to his father , they both go and have coffe, as if nothing had happened. Mr Wilcox is the character who goes though the most drastic transformantion, and in the end he is a vey different man, in many senses.<br />Finally, I love the film version of this book. I only regret I hadn't read the book before watching the movie. I think I would have had much more surprises. But, anyway, both book and film are worth reading  or/and watching.feel very confortable in the XX Century.

He likes arts and books, but his older wife prefers the joys of the world - and Mr Wilcox used to know it years ago.<br />The prose is so alive that sometimes I felt extremely agry with some characters, mainly Charles- the oldes Wilcox boy. He is so snobbish, self-centred and xenophibic. For instance, he doesn't face up the fact to that he's killed Mr Bast and after telling the event to his father , they both go and have coffe, as if nothing had happened. Mr Wilcox is the character who goes though the most drastic transformantion, and in the end he is a vey different man, in many senses.<br />Finally, I love the film version of this book. I only regret I hadn't read the book before watching the movie. I think I would have had much more surprises. But, anyway, both book and film are worth reading  or/and watching.	2001-12-21
US	49577356	R1A082FVB5PAHF	0312243022	785940945	The Hours: A Novel	Books	5	17	18	N	N	The Day They All Chose Life	I first read this book some years ago, and I hadn't read &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; by that time. Now, after reading Virginia Woolf's masterpiece, it was much more pleasant to read &quot;The Hours&quot;. Cunningham does not only make a homage to Mrs Dalloway, but also a reverence to Mrs Woolf and her unique style.<br />The book follows one single day in the lives of three different women living in different times and places. At first we are introduced to Virginia Woolf herself, who is an artist creating her most daring work. She is still at the begining of her novel, so we can see her development process. The second women who steps into this book is Clarissa -- a.k.a. Mrs Dalloway, named after the character by her friend and ex-lover Richard. She is a gay editor who is organising a party for Richard. The last one we meet is Laura Brown, who has just started reading &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; and wants to make a cake to celbrate her husband's birthday.<br />Page after page, these women got changed. Unexpected things crop up all the time. It's someone Clarissa meets at the park; it's Virginia's sister arriving earlier for a tea; it's Laura's neighbour asking her to look after a dog. Simple things that make them take small decisions, but decisions anyway.<br />As the book focus on one single day in these women's lives, not very big events happen all the time. The charm and appeal in Cunningham's writing are the daily situations. Ordinary things that everybody does are charmly discribed. Buying flowers is much more than this single act, it's wondering about how Clarissa could have been a closer friend to the shop keep; the result of Laura's cake may reflect her vision of her life -- although it's very nice, it's not really the way she wanted it to be--; Virginia changes her mind all the time about what she should do to her character-- does Clarrissa Dalloway kill herself? has she got a lost love?<br />The supporting characters step in and out of the book all the time, but they always leave some footsteps in the lives of our heroines. All of them have some problems and need the help of the main characters. It is the sick neighbour, or the sister worried about her kids, or a daughter and her friend.<br />I think one of the most interesting thing that happens to all three main character is the fact that they kiss another woman, and this make tehm change their minds. It's not a love kiss, it is just a silly one, just lips. But the effects are much stronger. Virginia decides that har Mrs Dalloway will kiss a woman either; Laura thows the horrible cake in the trash can; and Clarissa... well, she is a gay, so kissing another woman changed her mind years ago.<br />You may think it is a chick novel, but, definetely, it isn't. As a matter of fact, it is a book for grown ups, I don't mean you have to be old to get it, but you, surely, need some life experience in order to understand the character's fears and joys. What parent has never worried about a friend of his/her child (such as Clarissa, who does not like Mary Krull)? Or who has never wanted to give up his/her whole life a try something completely different as Laura and Virginia somehow?<br />Many people may feel a bit down after reading the book. Although the very begining and the last chapters deal with death, the book as a whole shows why we should choose life instead of just letting death take us. Even though Mrs Woolf has killed herself, she does not do it in that day. And we also learn near the end that Laura tried to kill herself either, but it didn't happen in the day told in the book. So 'the hours' of the described day are for celebrating life, more than this, they are to celebrate the option of choosing life!<br />All in all, it is an important book and I think that it deserves every single prize it won -- Pulitzer included. And more than this, it is a novel that deserves to be discovered more and more. If you haven't read &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; yet, you can enjoy &quot;The Hours&quot; a lot, but you'll feel very tempted to so afterwards.he Hours&quot; a lot, but you'll feel very tempted to so afterwards.	2001-12-19

I was completely wrong. It was not only useful for my course but also for my everyday life as an art enthusiast.<br />Now, three years and much more experience later I still have this book at hand because I always want to check something about a painter or a work. Her stile is unique and easy. Although the book is chronological developed, one can pick a picture at randon and read and learn about it. It deals with the whole history of painting since the primitive humans to the late 20th century artists. It is packed with beautiful colourful paintings that are a refresh for the eyes - some readers may find funny what I said hence the fact I am writing about a of about art, but I myself have some art history books in which most pictures are black &amp; white, what can be very frustating.<br />In the begining of every section, there's a very complete timeline showing historical and artitics events of each era. And in every single page there are some margin notes about any relevant point related to the main picture such as times, characters, literature...  But the most important thing, to me, is the study of the paintings. They are very detailed and easy to understand even for those who always complian not understanding art. Evey tecnical term that the writer uses is explained in an easy way.<br />It seems to me that the only thing that this book misses out is sculpture. But it is not actually a problem, once the book is about painting. I feel that after reading and studying most of this book - I haven't read everything yet- I've never looked to a painting as I did before. Now I know how to analyze and really enjoy it. I highly recomend this book for those who when contemplating a painting can only say &quot; OH! That's beatiful!&quot;,because everybody says so. This book will give you background to say why a painter is good or not.ckground to say why a painter is good or not.	2001-12-05
US	49577356	R1AKT2GSDHZZZ7	0684801469	11530247	A Farewell To Arms	Books	4	3	3	N	N	In Love and War	When I was in college, I took writing classes. In my group there was a girl who used to write very long clauses, with many whos, wheres, thats... One day, a Professor suggested her to read Hemingway paying atention to how he wrote sentences so short and at the same time so complete, with many information. So, everytime I  read Hemingway, I bear this in my mind! He always gets me over! And it's very efficient. Short sentences aren't tiring or boring. I think that is one of the reasons I like and admire his work.<br />When it comes to A Farewell to Arms, readers complain about a lack of character development - mainly before the war- and psychological analysis. And I agree. There isn't much of it through the narrative, but it seems to me this is not an accidental omission. My feeling is that the writer wanted to show us when you are at War - as the characters - it doesn't matter where you come from, what you've done, or what are your preferences. You are only one more soldier (or nurse, as he also portraits). And that's why we barely know what happen to them before the war had broken out.<br />I liked the book both as a love story and as a war novel. The love affair between the soldier and the nurse is very touching. And it kept me rooting for them all the time. The end of the novel got me down.	2001-12-03

Personally speaking, sometimes  I couldn't get very exactly what Henry James was trying to say, but I could understand the situation as a whole and be able to move on.<br />As everybody knows, Hery James is not an easy writer. His appeal is very difficult and complex although it doesn't read very old-fashioned. The story is very interesting and timeless, because it deals with passion, money and betrayal. The books follows Kate Croy and her beloved Merton Densher when then both get involved - in different degrees and with different interests- with the beautiful rich and sick American heiress Milly Theale.<br />Most of the time, the book kept me wondering what would come next and its result and the grand finale. But, that doesn't mean I was fully understand its words. As I said, I was just feeling what was going on. As a result, i don't think I was able to get all the complexity of Henry James. Maybe, if I read this book again in the futures, it will be clearer.<br />There is a film version of this novel made in 1997, and starring Helena Bonham Carter, Allison Elliot and Linus Roach, directed by Iain Softley. Carter is amazing as always! Kate is a bit different from the book, she is not only a manipulative soul, but, actually, she is a woman trying to find happiness. One character says of Kate, &quot;There's something going on behind those beautiful lashes&quot;, and that's true for most female leads created by James. Watching this movie helped me a lot, after finishing reading the novel.	2001-11-28

Although the title mention The Lover, in my opinion the book is about Lady Catterley herself.<br />It is very interesting to imagine the effect the story might have caused on people by the time its was first published. It's known that the author had many problems in order to get it released and had to use his own money to get it printed.Even nowadays, Lady Chatterley may shock some puritans, but its effect would never be as strong as in 1928. The large use of slang names for private parts sounds a bit funny, but still disturbing.<br />After finish reading the book, the mainly feeling I had was: selfshiness. All characters most of the time just worry about themselves. On the other hand, I would read very naive if I believed that human beings are not natural born selfish, consequently, people in this book are very close to people we met on the streets when it comes to feelings and emotions. Clifford, the husband, is disgusting. He is a British aristocrat and as so he looks down on everybody all the time.Nobody is good enough to be an equal. Mellors, the lover, appeared to be very polite and open minded in the beginning, but I change my mind in the middle of the novel, after Lady Chatterley spends a Sunday night with him. He sounds very sexist and racist in his speech. However, I think that was the common sense by that time, today readers may feel a bit unconfortable with his opinions- as I did-, but he can still be taken to. But the real 'star' of the novel is Connie, yes, I am talking about Lady Chatterley herself. At first, Clifford takes it out on her all the time- and I felt sorry for her.  Later, she finds a new love and starts living her own life - this is the best part of the book. We can't run her down having the love affair because she had such a boring and senseless life before Mellors. By the end - I won't give it - she is not the same person.<br />Some nice twists are saved for the last chapters, what makes the reading much more interesting. I highly recomend this book for whose who are not afraid of reading - and discovering - about sex.y the end - I won't give it - she is not the same person.<br />Some nice twists are saved for the last chapters, what makes the reading much more interesting.

I think that the fact of being written more than a hundrer years later than the time when the story takes place allows the writer to have a critical and ironic inight in his characters and events as well.<br />Fowles is a master when it comes to go over the XIX century using the XX century approach. From time to time he reminds us that when the book was being written most of the moral of its characters and situations had already changed. On the other hand, we can see that the world hasn't changed at all in many other subjects dealt in the book.<br />I guess that when the book was first published in the late '60s it caught on, and it is easy to understand, The French... goes with the sixties ideas.<br />To sum up, it is a book interesting for anyone who enjoys a good writting and wants to see how different ( or similar) we are from the Victorian Era.	2001-11-22

I know it's not Lawurence's masterpiece, but I touched me very deep. Everthing seems to wok in this book, from the characters to their enviroment.<br />It seems to me that Lawrence took daily events and showed them the way they are: unglamourised. He showed me what love and support seem to be. It's not about being happy all the time or that kind of love that happens only in movies. The book deals with the ordinary love, the one that normal human beings have the chance to face.<br />Following the experience of both couples made me see how different love can be and it is the still the same. I could perfectly understand all the worries and anxiets Gudrun had. And I think Gerald and she made quite a couple! Yet Birkin and Ursula look very nice together since the begin. Their love is not as 'wild' as the other couple's, but it is very strong indeed.<br />When the book was over I got down because I had to let them go. Following the lives of such people for a few days made quite an impression on me. Even though they may not be XXI century people like us, they have the same essence we do.<br />All in all, I know this review may read very emotive and personal, but this is a book that I couldn't apart in other to write about	2001-11-22

Anyone who has wondered 'what the hell am I doing here?' or 'it's only me or the world went Crazy?' will easily indentify him or herself to Susanna. <BR>Plus, there is all the late 60's madness surruonding every single page. It's not hard to close your eyes after reading some pages and just listen -inside your mind- songs by Jefferson Airplane, Buffalo Springfield, Janis Joplin ... and so many others, becase they get alive along with the book. <BR>I suggest to anyone who liked this book to move on to Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, because this book is as good and deep as Girl, Interrupted.	2001-10-18
