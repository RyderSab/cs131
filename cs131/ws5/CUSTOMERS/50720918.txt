All the usual elements are in place: action, suspense, mystery, Florida, humor, science, sex, fishing, boating, and more.  And as always we learn more interesting facts about the past of Doc and his buddy Tomlinson.  Some of the revelations about these characters were fascinating and surprising.  Now I'm ready to tear into Shark River.	2005-09-02

I'm a big fan of apocalyptic fiction and this book is one of the best of that genre.  As typical of Laymon, it's a fast and suspenseful read loaded with violence and gore.	2005-04-12

Revenge of the Sith is engrossing, detailed, insightful, and action-packed.  The battle sequences will blow you away.  Those who only see the movie will be missing out on a lot of important details.  Only in a book can you really get inside the heads of the characters.  My only complaint is that book completely skips over Yoda's escape from the clone attack on the Wookie homeworld of Kashyyyk.  For that reason I would have given it 4 1/2 stars if given the choice.	2005-04-12

However, with this prosperity comes a human and environmental price.	2005-01-21

It's one of the most humorous books I've ever read.  This is in contrast with descriptions of  what is best described as a living hell. Jimmy Lerner provides a realistic and captivating account of prison life. I only wish he'd write a part two.	2004-06-17

The Doc Ford novels are fantastic and they've got a little bit of everything.  There's mystery, suspense, action, sex, Florida history, science, politics, and fishing!  What also impresses me about these books is that they appeal to both women AND men.  I think the Doc Ford books have a lot of machismo but that doesn't seem to deter the numerous female fans (my mother included).  The Doc Ford novels even got my father reading.  He's not an avid reader but with my prodding he tried Sanibel Flats and ended up quickly reading the entire series.  White writes an exciting novel that's chalked full of interesting tid-bits and with each passing novel in the series he develops his characters more fully.	2004-06-17

Reading this for the first time many years after it was published, it is amazing to see how much it has influenced movies and books that came later.  It's a very quick read that makes you wish it were longer.	2004-05-27

Like I am Legend, which the author acknowledges, Midnight Mass is a post-apocalyptic vampire masterpiece.  There are a lot of short descriptions of events in Midnight Mass that leaves the reader wanting more.  In fact, Midnight Mass is but one story in what is best described as a vampire world war.  Wilson could have easily made this the second volume in a series as it lends itself to a prequel.  And with the open ending there's definitely room for a follow-up.  It's a fast, fun, book that's full of action and gore.	2004-05-27

The Art of Raising a Puppy is an incredibly comprehensive book that has everything you need to know about getting a puppy, raising it properly, and turning it into a well trained dog.  If there's one negative to the book, it's that there's more information than the average dog owner can use.  However, you can take as much or as little as you want from this book.  The important thing is to read it.  If you're going to purchase two dog-training books, I also recommend the Canine Good Citizen.	2004-05-07

The Truth About Dogs provides a fascinating history of dogs; where they came from, their relationship with humans, and why they do what they do.  Of particular interest is the section on purebred dogs, which turned me (a former purebred devotee) into a mutt lover.	2004-05-07

It you can get past that and suspend your disbelief (especially when it comes to Tor-Tor) you'll really enjoy this tale of non-stop jungle adventure. There is plenty of action, violence, and gore.  I listened to the book on cassette and the reader does a great job of using different voices, expression, and inflection.  It would make a great popcorn movie.	2004-04-05

There's a lot going in this multileveled book but at its heart it is a great adventure tale.  However, I also feel that the author tried to do too much with the story.  Some chapters seem pointless and confusing and could be omitted.  The main story line (of the Helios expedition) makes the book absolutely worthwhile but I think some of the ideas should have been used in separate (but related) books.  I'd love to read a \\"Descent\\" series.  The bottom line is I love the book and I'm still thinking about it long after finishing it.	2004-03-15

Be warned that it is graphically violent and sexual but I expect that'll attract more readers than deter them.  I'm sure some will claim that it's sexist and misogynistic but you have to keep in mind that it's written from the perspective of a horny male teenager.	2004-02-25

Through Totch we learn of a nearly forgotten way of life and we see the Everglades as it used to be.  I appreciate his honesty and plainspokeness and I'm thankful Totch made this book to preserve an important history.  I also recommend the three movies made about him: Totch Brown's tales of the Everglades and 10,000 islands, The Everglades outlaw Totch Brown, and Yesterday's Everglades.	2004-02-25
US	50720918	RKSO2IZGN2XPW	0553379615	160413158	Into the Forest	Books	5	8	9	N	N	post-apocalyptic masterpiece	Overlooked when it was published more than a decade ago, Into the Forest is difficult to classify. It is a novel of female empowerment, ecology, and science fiction. In the near future of the novel; war, famine, and disease has thrown the United States into a perpetual state of anarchy. Against this post-apocalyptic backdrop, Eva and Nell, two orphaned teenage girls must learn to survive alone in a California forest. It is here that they discover their sexuality, create new lives for themselves and possibly a blueprint for a new society; one in which we become part of the natural world. It's a powerful story of love, the human spirit, and endurance. Although the book is required reading in some women's studies courses, it has appeal to both genders with its action-driven storyline. Jean Hegland has written a lyrical and engrossing novel with an ending so moving that it will stay with you for years.	2003-12-27

It's a shame more people haven't heard of him or more importantly, his book, The Straw Men, which is really more like two books in one.  This novel is a mystery and a thriller that is more complex and more satisfying than the typical novel of this type.  Pick it up and you won't be able to put it down.	2003-12-05

Boy was I disappointed.  This book is a boring, rambling mess that made little sense and did nothing to further the series.  Save yourself some time by reading the first 200 pages (at most) and then the last two chapters.  You won't miss a thing.  Let's just hope the next one is better and that he starts listening to his editor (or gets one with the guts and/or power to trim his novels).	2003-12-02
