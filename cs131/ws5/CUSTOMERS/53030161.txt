The peace message must raise its voice and we must respond, regardless of who's collecting royalties or quoting whom.    <br /> <br />In the early part of the book Deepak presents the Tangled Hierarchy of Fear/Greed/Unsustainability and shows us then how and why this must be replaced with Tangled Hierarchy of Love/Sharing/ Compassion/sustainability/ peace consciousness.  I found this a valuable framework first because it's more realistic than the current black or white myopia that the media and political systems are helping to maintain (whether intentional or not;) a narrow focus on issues limits our interpretation of problems and then therefore limits our ability to provide solutions.  An example of these important `peace linkages' in our time can be seen in the recent Nobel Peace Prize winner, Wangari,  a lifelong environmentalist, who has taught women, the primary victims or caretakers of victims from war, to plant trees, helping themselves and their communities. The other concept that I agree with in this framework is the focus on peace and all its origins versus saying `not war.'  Deepak then shows us how we each need to realize and choose the sustainable ways of peace consciousness in our own lives, hoping and working toward the tipping point; when the majority of us have accepted and projected peace, we change humanity toward this pattern of peace.  <br /> <br />I love the hopefulness presented in this book, the affirmation to hold on to the hope for peace and the absolute necessity for committed peacemakers to do so.   There are many great affirmations throughout for further exploration and to lead us toward the tipping point such as \\"What you resist, persists; what you can feel, you can heal,.\\" to further the requirement for transformation that begins in each of our hearts, a common theme throughout Deepak's writing.   The promise for peace resides in each one of us creating a reality of peace, living responsibly within that reality and leveraging the systems so we can change them.  (Deepak suggests that the aware vote has more power!) Pick your path to peace.  While the world may seem far from peace maybe we are rather approaching this tipping point such that what we see around us then is the last ditch attempt for the greedy, fear mongers to get their last fill because they too know at some level which they may not even recognize, that the times they are a changing; peace. <br />	2005-05-29

Even the House of Representatives on C-SPAN last night were talking to the charts of Hubbert's Peak so start by accepting that reality. Else denial will continue to find its out maybe as witnessed then in a scramble to take over the last of the natural resources, or the frantic desire to build out our homes or cars well beyond need, while continuing to live lives of excess with little regard for environmental impact.    Further exasperating the situation is the main stream media that not only ignores but rather continues to push the consumer message, as their dozen or so owners in this private ownership society continue to benefit by our addiction to consumption, of which petroleum is an integral part.  In a state of ideology, we're more offended by the truth than the message that reinforces our own little world.   <br /> <br />This book takes the reader deep into the prophesy that stems from the hierarchy of devastation, fear and selfishness but does not admit our psychological and emotional state as a core problem or its solution which each one of us including the author must participate in to create a post industrial future that we each want to be a part of.  If we continue the path of excess and ignorance that we're currently on, then we are reinforcing Kunstler's depressing world view.   <br /> <br />You might want to read Limits to Growth to at least bring yourself into the realization that we need to act on post petroleum solutions, without Kunstler's somewhat hopeless perspective; reading between the lines I sensed that Kunstler feels more comfortable with his gun than with himself, a problem that many of us share.  To survive in the post industrial era we must move away from our negative emotions, anger, revenge and fear and instead evolve to become loving, compassionate and respectful human beings.  Also seek news beyond the television and honestly look at the policies and practices, actions not words,  of our political players and make an aware choice when you enter the ballot booth.   <br /> <br />The point is that we must participate, make choices and realize that we create the world based on our choices and the intentions from whence the choices come; I am not sure if reading the Long Emergency will bring the reader to this key realization, although there is the philosophy that complete disillusionment is a path to awareness and as such, I'm giving it 3 stars.	2005-05-22

Did we ever realize that we were one with the environment and each other or is this saving recognition of truth still to come? <br />  In reality we are still living with our 20th century lifestyles with little regard for even questioning whether we should change.  This book proves we need to change our habits and our attitudes toward each other and the planet itself.  It's amazing to me that we so readily discount years (30 Years in the this case) of scientific evidence that describes factually our energy, land and resource use,  in ways that are overextening the earth's support systems, like air and water. This is further witnessed in our local papers with articles on inner city asthma from ozone and mercury rendering fish inedible, yet we live in denial.  When  will we accept that the human footprint is bigger than the earth can handle, i.e. unsustainable, and realize that it's only depressing if we do nothing about it? <br />If someone does not believe we have issues that we need to put governmental, corporate and individual resources toward resolving,  I'd hand him this book which also talks to solutions including alterative energy sources and ways of being.  Well defined facts and figures can help bring us toward the inclusion of ecological solutions as part of our shared concern for life.  We need to achieve a paradigm shift toward sustainability leveraging the following starter tools: visioning, networking, truth telling, learning and loving; by the latter is meant love of humanity and nature and increasing desire for nurture, further emphasis on positive thinking over scare tactics, and the need to respond compassionately to the truth.  <br />	2004-11-27

The message of this book is about us humans realizing that we are all connected to One God, One Life Force that includes all of Life itself, and therefore requires us to respect all things Created, each other and our ecosystems.  I love Jesus Christ because of the WAY He lived; he would agree that we are of One Body.  This book is blasphemy only if we hold onto the words rather than see beyond the words to truth.  If we recognize and respond to our unity that includes the Love of God there will be more compassion, more responsible action; even the selfish will realize that to hurt another hurts oneself.  Anger burns the angry the most.    <br />The author is right in saying that we need to change our negative behavior patterns.  I ask, Has Money become God?  Is the Almighty Dollar worth more than our own well being as seen in the consequences of the loss of the forests, lands turning to desert, lack of attention paid to human impact on the greater whole?     Must some of us stuff ourselves to obesity while so many starve?  Must we give into the media telling us we have to look a certain way or buy certain things to be happy?  Is this the Way?  Who is really running our lives?  Why are we so freely giving away our freedom?  What are we afraid of?  There should be no fear in a state of Grace.<br />Religion has helped to do much good such as charitable relief organizations that give over 80% of their collected funds to help the poor &amp; hungry.   We've created and we can end this hunger by giving to or working with these kinds of groups.  This author rightly also suggests that the man made aspect of religion is loaded with man made self interests and bias and as such can bring about separation. See this happening in this day and age with the extreme acts of violence in the name of God!   <br />The Truth should only serve to strengthen your Love of God.  Realize that you are the Light of the World; every day is judgment day or otherwise said, Today is the first day ofthe rest of our lives.  Read and Act and still go to church and worship. The only threat herein is one for those who want to sleepwalk their way through life; this book will wake you up!<br /> We create the future by our actions today.

(see that Amazon review.)  <br />It's the message that counts!  We are all connected.  We must realize this connectiveness that extends to the energy of the universe and includes the forests that we are quickly eliminating because we cannot see this connection with our eyes.  The answer to peace is to seek it from within and utilize the remaining bits of nature to help show us the way as the character in this book does.  I will continue to believe in the power of human potential for constructive rather than destructive greatness and you can too by examining your own contributions or detractions from the whole.<br />Even for me this story line is arguably a bit far fetched but it still echoes the dangerous patterns of behavior that lead us humans the wrong direction and offers some solutions on the journey that you may have heard before but maybe this time it will stick (like eat your vegetables for energy!)  <br />This book is worth the very quick read that it affords, to see what insights you might garner, or just to stop for a moment under a shady tree, read and drink in the energy, before you continue on the adventure of life!	2004-05-12

I enjoyed the explanations on consciousness with scientific affirmation for these experiences.  I am relatively well read on this subject matter but still found some new perspectives however I am not sure how easy this all is to grasp in general.  Chopra does make it more tangible in the second half of this book by providing meditations including ancient Sanskrit Sutras, or Mantra's with meaning, that have been reverberating since veritably the beginning of time, that we can practice some or all of.   <br />Most importantly, the message presented in this book is essential to our creating shared happiness and peace in this world which somewhere behind the wall of delusion, self-centeredness and materialism, is our true shared goal.  That is, we need to realize our connective-ness in this world, the universal energy, power, consciousness, Spirit, God, whatever name we call it, which connects us to each other and to all living things (including the fewer and fewer trees left that we've not cut down!)  This is not about religion; to deny the Spirit because of our disillusionment with religion is also a falsehood.  <br />Each of us needs to actively focus our attention and intentions on the greater good to bring about positive change; change happens one person at a time.  If you feel lonely or depressed please realize that the solutions we seek are not found in material goods, legal or illegal drugs or the bottle; we create solutions when we center our attention and intentions on the greater flow of the universe.  Mere words are not enough to describe this important message; read this book and the ones recommended by other reviewers until you understand the message and then live it!	2004-02-06

This book provides a well organized framework for us human beings to manage our energy by defining its sources first on the dimensions of physical, mental, emotional and spiritual.  Physical energy's source is primarily food, breathing, sleep and exercise.  Mental energy is most optimal when we strive to be realistic optimists (we are what we eat AND what we think.)  Emotional energy relies on all the facets of emotional intelligence including trust.  Last and not least as spiritual energy is the starting point for all this energy; very secularly put, the energy of the spirit is all about core values beyond self interests.  The authors also show us how we can create positive habits, or rituals to enrich these sources of energy.  After reading this book and realizing that I do strive to tap into all four of these sources I was better able to define one of my own core competencies; I would think most employers want someone who is indeed fully engaged!	2003-08-01

Actually the concepts are not really new.  If you're familiar with Jungian concepts, you'll note similarities herein as well as with the teachings of Jesus Christ and Buddha and a number of the world's great psychologists, philosophers and spiritualists.  Personally I believe all these teachings to be true and to be saying basically the same things. I also appreciate the author's sense of urgency and I believe that we must awaken and respond to the urgency of the messages summarized within this book or like books if you cannot let yourself be enlightened by this book.<br />Enough of why to read this, let me tell you what I heard while reading.  First, we are all connected by the great life force, call it spirit if you like, the author refers to it as the now, that exists within each one of us and every living thing.  Result of this recognition will be respect and compassion for others and all living things as well as your own internal peace which is in the end that which we are really seeking.  We must constantly observe and challenge our thoughts and the inherent patterns of response that we share with all humans, (Yung called this the collective unconscious.)  That means asking yourself, why do I feel this way, why can't I stop thinking about this, why did I do that etc..  Another essential message is forgiveness; specifically the author cites that we need to forgive the past.  We hang onto anger and bitterness and perpetuate pain; to forgive frees us from this.  For many, not allowing forgiveness of another or the past, that which has already happened, causes them to be physically ill today.  It is hard to forgive but harder to hold onto these grudges.  The other half of staying in the now is of course living in the future, or living for the goal instead of living along the way to the goal. Isn't that what Carpe Diem means?  <br />God is love; in a state of true Spirit, in the now as the author cites it, there is only love and joy.  If you've never felt this comfort, seek it now.  It is a hard truth to realize that we are perpetuating our own suffering because it means we are responsible not only for the cause but for the solution as well.  If we each sought, found and acted on our own storehouse of inner peace, suffering would end.  While this is an ideal, it can happen, as change does happen, one person at a time starting with the person in the mirror. <br />This book also has an interesting chapter on relationships further citing to the discomfort of some readers that women have more power because they are more in tune with their whole beings that includes their Spirit; if you want this power, read this book, or some of the other recommendations but respond to these common messages while we still have time.  While I think human beings may be able to survive for a good while, I am very concerned that our planet cannot.  My only other comment on this book and that those of us who are already awake must do more than just be conscious in whatever way we can; much is expected to those who have been given much.	2003-06-03

Books	5	2	3	N	N	Dreamrunning your way through life	This book is an easy read that allows us to then to face life facts with instant solutions!  For example, change is inevitable and increased so we must seek ways to deal with this inevitability.  The author points out that for starters, we must detach ourselves from the outcome; that is, be happy doing as opposed to only when you are done.  When you enter the present, you expand time; Kant also espoused this as the author points out.  Stop expecting.  Let events in life flow through you; all we can control is our response.  Identify with your life force, your Spirit; we must develop new ways of knowing and being.  <br />This book is written by a runner who continues to run and who seeks to realize his human potential and is happier because of this.  (Hence the subtitle A Dreamrunner's Guide) The author provides some specific tips in particular mindsets for running; I'm more of a sprinter myself but this book makes me think I can also haul the longer distance!	2003-06-03

These mind life participants from various backgrounds all agree that destructive emotions namely anger, craving, delusion and all their offshoots are just that-destructive and we as human beings must train ourselves to become aware of the potential of these emotions so that we can truly change for the better and create peace.<br />A major tenet of Buddhism is the belief that us humans beings can free ourselves from the grips of these destructive emotions.  This books shows us that the more secular scientific approach agrees and proves that we can change.  The participating scientists  speak of current and future neurological experimentation, some involving yogis or those trained in meditation techniques, that prove for example that mind training such as mediation can alter the brain in ways that endure.  This book further speaks to the affirmation and hope that we can change because of neuroplasticity.  That is, scientific studies as referenced herein have revealed that the brain and the nervous system generate new cells in learning for example; the brain can reshape itself!  This books also provides new insights for the field of psychology.<br />I hope that this important message not only endures but continues to be acted on through training adults and children toward a better way of being that we can all reap the rewards of; I believe the future of humanity depends on this.

I decided that Sacred Contracts was not a book for me to finish reading.  Although many of the reviewers who liked this book, also like the archetypal descriptions, I found these to be much too skimpy to compare with the complexity of human beings, as opposed to a storybook or a movie.  Even those archetypes that I knew to associate with still left me feeling incomplete.  <br />While I wholeheartedly believe in our inner power from the Divine and a holistic approach to our lives that should include others and the earth itself, I feel that we cannot so neatly assign ourselves in succinct packages of the collective unconscious otherwise known as archetypes that this method suggests.  In fact I wonder if we lose touch with mystery when we try too hard, as I felt the assignment of this book called for, to define that which is in reality indefinable; we can be in awe and acceptance of mystery and still not understand it!<br />Yes, we need to understand our strengths and weaknesses, the latter I felt was over emphasized here, so that we can in turn be more compassionate towards others.  So, rather than read this book, do something nice for someone else!  You'll note that the shadow sides of these archetypes are all related to self-centeredness.  One who seeks to help others avoids the trap of the shadow.	2002-11-06

Admittedly, this book is not easy to get through but worth the bit of struggle; it seems everyone should be interested in psychology since it's how we think, our attitudes and resulting behavior that rules our lives and the lives of all the human beings that we come in contact with!  <br />Interspersed with Jung's theories are real life psychoanalytical scenarios most centered around dream analysis which I thought was way more real and interesting than reality TV!  Prior to reading this book, I did not realize how much of Jung's theory has become a part of our lives, such as archetypes, although I think these were originally discussed by Plato, projection and transference, synchronicity and of course the individuation process.  The latter is the acceptance of our humanness on a holistic level and the continuing discovery of our potential.  <br />Warning, this book may raise your level of consciousness and force you to realize that the world does not revolve around you!

I have affirmed my belief in my power and responsibility to shape the world.  I have learned much about the human condition. I have helped others with the knowledge that anxiety (of the existential kind as opposed to the neurotic kind, the latter being the denial of anxiety) is actually a positive state since if acknowledged it can lead one to a rebirth.

By the looks of these well-used library books, many families have shared the joy of drawing with Ed and each other!  He makes it so simple that my 5-year-old can readily render this art; I think Ed made these books remembering his love for art when he was about 5.   My 9 year old and my 5 year old also enjoy these books; we are getting our own copies today!	2001-01-19

The Diamond Cutter affirms, in matter of fact way, the power of integrity, generosity and positive thinking as proved throughout history.  You can be of any belief system including no belief system to gain insight from this book.  The author provides a case study, for human behavior, based on his experiences in the Diamond business.  I applied many of the work specific examples including how to handle someone yelling at you! <br />'Any work has honor if it's honest work and it's OK to make money so long as you are not stingy;' I needed to hear this!<br />You can apply one or two or all of these ideas gradually or all at once into your daily living but at least read and decide how you can make peace.  It is not easy to live out these concepts but hey, we can at least try.  As each of us takes full and active ownership for our value system, we will change the world!	2000-11-28
