This book is long and plodding! It parades itself as investigatory but  there are inaccuries and mistakes throughout the book.  Even if its an  expose book, it's not a very good one becuase its not dramatic nor eye  catching. The writing is plodding and becomes boring, you start wondering  where the sensational material is. Not a good book on the Clinton scandals,  its not informative.

Alexander's &quot;official&quot; centennial Utah history is a strong  overview of the history of Utah. Their are many pictures to make the work  interesting, and the narrative is flowing and enjoyable. It's only flaw its  that it does focus on Mormons, but that is the majority religious group in  the state so he can be forgiven. The book celebrates the people of Utah  past and present and glosses over some not so pretty events. A must read  for anyone interested in Utah history.	2000-08-19

This book is a collection of essays that cover many aspects of Utah history from the Mormons to Miners to Native Americans to the Depression  and World War II.  The essayists write clearly and make possibly dry topics  at least palatable, such as the ones on the economy in Utah.  It is  organized mostly chronilogically and the main idea of all the essays is how  the people of Utah expirienced life in the state, and sometimes it wasn't  what was expected, thus the title, &quot;A World We Thought We Knew.&quot;  The title could also be a commentary on the reader as well. Someone who is  not familiar with Utah history or has a stereotypical view of Utah history  will be surprised at the depth and breadth of the Utah expirience.  The  essays were certainly thought provoking and painted a picture of diversity  and struggle throughout the history of Utah.	2000-08-19

This book is a thought provoking account on how various groups and enitites sought to bring down President Clinton.  The book covers just  about every scandal that has dogged Clinton for his entire political  career. One large omission which should have been discussed however are the  campaign finance and China connection that the DNC and Clinton engaged in.   The selling of the Lincoln bedroom, tea parties in the White House, and how  China was able to donate to the DNC, and Clinton's very amorous attidutes  towards China needed a deeper discussion that what was given.        This  book details the over zealous efforts by Clinton's enemies to bring him  down. It is a well documented work, and persuasivley argued.  I am not a  Clinton supporter, I do not like Clinton and think he is one of our worst  presidents however I must admit this book is a good one to read.      In  thier &quot;Aferword&quot; section the authors suggest that Clinton's  shenanigans did not hurt America or the Presidency. I strongly disagree. I  think Clinton lowered the moral standard needed for public office, he  damaged the credibility of his office, he was/and still is a poor role  model for our children.	2000-08-16

The book paints a picture of the idealistic  and somewhat tortured personal lives of two people who get caught up in the  corruption of not only Arkansas, but Washington D.C.  The book does get  kind of bogged down in discussing tangents to the main theme of the book,  the Clintons, but its meant to show what kind of Arkansas and Washington  D.C. they came into politically.  The book, although defintely not  pro-Clintons, avoids purely polemical and emotional language and writing.   It is a sad commentary on politics in general and our country when corrupt  people can get into high places.	2000-08-12

The best thing about this book is that it uses Soviet and Chinese sources that up until early this decade (meaning the 90's) were unavailable to U.S. historians.

The authors take a detailed look at the Kirland, Nauvoo and Salt Lake City temples and discuss the architecture of each building and the symbolism of various designs in each of the temples. The book is well organized and easy  to read. There are good illustrations to help the reader visualize what the  authors are discussing.  The book has good footnotes and a bibliography for  further study.

The book is well researched and well written. As an academic book it is very good, however the author's discussion ignores the deep spiritual attachment that many members of the church have towards the temple, his  book focuses on why members might not like the temple ceremony rather than  why a vast majority draw strenght from temple worship. The list of books in  the appendix that describe what goes on in the temple are mostly polemical  works that mock, and denigrate things that are sacred to a large group of  people.	2000-08-01

Good, but needed North POV	I read the first edition of this book (published 1979).  This is an excellent introduction into the Vietnam War.  The book does focus on the politics and policies of the United States rather than more palatable  topics such as the human stories of the war. The book gives a firm  background into the years preceding American involvment in Vietnam.  The  first edition needed the perspective of communist sources to make it a more  well rounded work, but of course at the time that was near impossible. A  good book for anyone interested in a general history of the Vietnam war.	2000-07-31

The authors incorporate the persepectives of all sides of the war in their work.  Not only is the war itself discussed, but the antiwar movement, North Vietnam's strategies and policy decisions.  The book although full of  details, the writing moves the book along avoiding the weight of tedium, (I  was able to read the book in a few days).  At the end is an admirable  attempt at assesing not only the historiography of the Vietnam War but also  the evolution of popular depictions of the war and American/Vietnamese  relations during the intervening 25 years. This last section could have  been a little more clearly written. It kind of felt like the authors were  jumping all over the place in dealing with post-1975 relations,  historiography, and popular perceptions of the war. Overall, a must read to  any student of the Vietnam War.	2000-07-31

This book was less about Ho Chi Minh, and more about why the United States should not fight him.  This reader was hoping for a more detailed discussion of Ho's life, his philosophy, etc. This book does over some  insights into Ho Chi Minh's character and life, but I was left with the  feeling that the book was written for other purposes. The book was  originally published in 1970, a year after Ho's death so the book also  smacks of the eulogy, glorification of the dead variety.	2000-07-31

I remember the first time I read Pawn of Prophecy. It's so riveting that you can't put it down.  It takes you on a magical journey with many twists and  turns.  I love this series so much that I have read it at least half a  dozen times and I catch myself reading it over and over again.  There are  times you are so caught up in the excitement that you forget you know how  it ends.  I love the ways you see Garion grow up and starting to realize  that things aren't really as they seem.  I also love the characters Aunt  Pol, Durnik, the old storyteller, Silk and Barak.  You get so involved with  the books you want them to continue forever.  I will probably read the  series so many times that my books will get worn out.  I think if you get  Pawn of Prophecy you need to get the rest of the series so you can keep  reading without having to wait to get the next book.	2000-07-06

This book was wonderful.  It let you see the stuggle of the light and dark thru the daughter of Belgarath the Sorcerer.  It takes you on a journey to place that Belgarath  briefly touched on.  I really enjoyed seeing the world and history thru her  eyes.  I also enjoyed the female perspective.  It helps you understand even  more the character Polgara in the series.  After I read Polgara the  Sorceress I reread the series to look for things I may have missed but now  understand.  I enjoyed seeing her raise Belgarion's family by hiding and  protecting them.  I enjoyed reading about her time with the Arendish  people.  You learn in this book where she learned her love of cooking, the  beginning of her close relationship with her Uncle Beldin and why she  detested her father so much at times.  You also learn what drove her to  become a physician. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy  or who loves David Eddings books.	2000-07-06

He tells you how it difficult it can be and informs you of the basic building blocks of good fantasy.  I also  enjoyed his different religious books for the different people of The  Belgariad and the Malloreon.  Anyone who has the desire to write this genre  needs to read this book.  Also if you are a fan of David Eddings it is very  informative of how he came up with the characters and the extent of the  background history of the series.  I really enjoyed his commentary thru out  the book.  I also enjoyed hearing about his own history and background on  becoming a fantasy writer.  He helps you realize that it is very hard work  to become a really good writer.	2000-07-06

The organization of her chapters is excellent. She critiques every aspect of the Turner thesis.

Limerick seeks  to include everyone in her story of the American West, not just white,  Anglo-American cowboys and Native Americans. A wonderful book.  There is  NEW stuff in this book, in that before her few historians of the west  looked at women, Asians, Indians from their perspective, blacks, etc.  A  must read for any student of the American West!	2000-06-29

I don't know that one could write a comprehensive book on one topic, but this comes very close.  Although at times plodding Johnson covers Jewish history from beginning to current.  I learned a ton about the Jewish faith  and people and I felt that I was getting a balanced fair discussion without  propaganda.  Other than the at times plodding narrative the only other  problem with this book is that the chapters go for 100 pages without any  subdividing. Johnson needed to break these long chapters down to make them  easier to digest, and to make it easier to stop reading and rest. It was  very easy to get lost in the chapter that is why it needed some subdividing  of topics. Anyway, the book is wonderful and a must read!	2000-06-29

Backus is a distant relative of Phillip Klingensmith a participant in the Mountain Meadows Massacre. The author seeks to tell Klingensmith's life story by weaving her narrative with the testimony he gave in the first  trial of John D. Lee.  It is a unique way to carry her story and her  writing is engaging, and favorable towards Klingensmith.  She does tend to  take Klingensmith at his word, and doesn't deal with the few times he was  misleading or lied during his testimony, especially when he was talking  about the massacre. On the whole a good book, and well worth the reading.	2000-06-29

From a secular academic point of view this book is well written and well researched and offers some interesting insights into Mormon temple worship. The book has two main problems however. First, the book ignores why the  temple is so important to faithful Mormons. It downplays the spritiual  importance of temple worship to a faithful member of the church. Second, at  the end is an appendix of works where you can find the Endowment ceremony  discussed. Most of the books are polemical works which are vindictive and  inacurrate. The books in this appendix mock things that are sacred to  Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. It's like the  Ancient Romans mocking the first Christians for believing that their God  died and rose again the third day.  It's sad that people can't respect  other people's religious faith.	2000-06-28

She traces her large family from one of her ancestors who came to America during the 1860's.  She handles the numerous story lines well  and the pedigree chart at the beginning is very valuable in helping the  reader keep track of her family. The author also does a good job of  incorporating her family into the times they lived in. We see her family  not in isolation from the world, but as part of world and local events.  This adds humaness and closeness to the people in her story. She is  non-judgemental and attempts to handle &quot;family skeletons&quot; with  tact, although you get the feeling that her version of some events isn't  what some family members believe, And she seems to have the &quot;I'm  grandpa's favorite grandchild&quot; attitude which doesn't neccesarily hurt  the book, but you wonder how her relatives felt about the book. Although  the book is long, the story keeps you interested. Defintley a must read.	2000-06-20

This book is an example of how the end of the Cold War has helped American history be less &quot;Americancentric&quot;. We think one thing, but along comes Chinese and Soviet sources that help us have a more balanced view of  the past. The book traces the relationship between the U.S., U.S.S.R. and  China from 1945-1972. It is well researched and well argued and for the  most part balanced.  I felt there could have been a little clearer  discussion of what lead up to the Nixon visit to China in 1972, It still  seemed to just happen. A must for those interested in the cold war, China  and Soviet communism and the such.	2000-06-20

This book is generally good, unfortunatley the class I took that used this book was not good. So I'm having trouble separating the book from the class. Taken by itself the book is informative and I feel does a good job  of covering the various expiriences of women.  The book, of course, does  take a liberal slant but the attempt to be balanced is there and should be  appreciated by readers of a more conservative slant. The authors do have an  agenda, as do most liberal feminists, and they make no apologies for their  ideas. The best sections are the ones dealing with women and sexuality. The  authors are sensitive and try to go beyond mere male-bashing. The authors  also stick to significant issues, (something the class didn't do), and to  keep the book from getting to boring they insert cartoons, usually  Doonsberry, to illustrate their case. The cartoons are appropriate and add  to the work.	2000-06-20

The book is well written and I  found it enjoyable to read.

This book focuses on the diplomatic history of the United States from 1801-1815. There is very little social history, and &quot;the people&quot; are usually only reffered to in their reaction to larger political and  diplomatic events. However, the author's style is readable and catching.  Diplomatic history can be very boring, but Smelser has melded academic  scholarship with writing that can interest almost anyone.	2000-06-18

The authors take ten Asian leaders from five countries (China, Indonesia, India, Cambodia and Vietnam)and studies their lives and their leadership qualities. After a wonderful introduction of each country the authors  attempt to answer such questions as: What motivates people? Is their an  &quot;Asian&quot; way to lead? What makes a leader good or bad? Often in  each country they take leaders of opposite viewpoints such as Diem and Ho  Chi Minh in Vietnam. Diem was the Anti-Communist leader of South Vietnam  and Minh was the communist leader of North Vietnam.  The book also looks  into why people follow certain brutal leaders such as Mao and Pol Pot. It  looks at the establishing of personality cults and how the leader used that  to his advantage.	2000-06-10

Lewis gives us excellent insight and perspective on the nature of temptation and how Satan works. The work is set up as correspondances between a beaucrat in hell and his nephew Wormwood.  The letters are advice  and training for Wormwood who is given charge of luring certain people down  to Hell. The book is entertaining, humorous, but also deep and should  strike a chord with those expiriencing strong temptation in their life  towards some form of evil.  The best way to fight your enemy is to know  him, and this book is an theory on how the devil and his angels might work  to take souls away from God.

This book takes various beliefs of the LDS church such as God, Salvation, the relationship between God and man and argues for LDS beliefs using philosophy and logic.

Ann Eliza Young was President Brigham Young's 19th wife.  This book is a reproduction of her own autobiography.  It is obvious in the book that Young expected much more from her marriage with President Young than he  did.  She apparantly expected Young to be much more attentive,  affectionate, and caring for her.  Young for whatever reasons, (running a  church, a territory and having 20 other wives might have something to do  with it), was not able to offer Ann Eliza the marriage she wanted.  Ann's  problem is more with Brigham Young as a husband and father than the Mormon  church itself.  One reading her tale should sympathize with her but should  be wary about her bias in telling about Mormon beliefs.	2000-05-26

This book has several major problems.  One, It's way too long and tedious. Second,Quinn's conclusions can be debated especially in regards to how acceptable folk magic was in the United States during the early 19th  century.  Third, as with all of his books since his excommunication Quinn's  &quot;hidden agenda&quot; is to show that Joseph Smith wasn't really an  inspired prophet but was deeply learned about magic and used that to start  Mormonism. This leads to another debateable point. First, how learned was  Joseph Smith? Quinn seems to think that a young teenaged Joseph Smith who  lived on a farm in rural New York had all day to sit around and read magic  books from local bookstores. Come on! Second, Quinn logic seems weak at  points, i.e. &quot;There was a bookstore with magic books only five miles  from Joseph Smith's home, so he must have read the book.&quot; or  &quot;Some early members of the church believed in Astrology so that must  mean the Mormon church during the 19th century believed in Astrology.&quot;  These are not direct quotes but the essence of some of his logic. Quinn's  footnotes are to long and tedious to investigate. In fact he goes to so  much length to footnote that one wonders: 1-does Quinn have any original  thoughts and 2-Is he burying us with footnotes to make up for weak evidence  and poor conclusions?  Another problem with this book is Quinn spends way  to much time fighting his critics in the book. Is this book about Early  Mormonism or Why my critics are wrong? Like some of his other works Quinn  again seems to have a &quot;hidden&quot; desire to fight against the church  that excommunicated him.  Advice: Quinn stop whining and fighting your  critics and work on your research and writing skills.  This book has some  good thought provoking sections.	2000-05-25

The book is balanced in its treatment of the Mormon religion in every way.  The research is very thorough. Any student of Mormon polygamy or the History of  Utah should read this book.

The book is a good compliation of issues and events leading up to the Civil War, and during and after. However, if you are a Civil War buff or are a student of History, or a professional historian you might find the  book dull, because you probably already know it.  I would reccomend this  book to high school students, college freshman or anyone who feels their  knowledge of U.S. History lacking, (which unfortunatley is common in our  society.) I found my self skimming alot, already knowing the information.   The author gives a nice touch of primary source material by quoting some  appropriate words from someone from the era a chapter is discussing.  The  book is also nicely organized into questions that he answers, like  &quot;What does the Constitution say about Slavery?&quot;  I found some of  his conclusions strained however, for example &quot;if there had been no  Lousiana Purchase there might not have been a Civil War.&quot;  It's that  kind of strained conclusions and sloppy logic that gives History a bad name  in our society.  Anyways, good book, informative, and well done.	2000-05-25

It goes year by year  discussing major events, and some minor ones in baseball history for that  year.  It attempts to trace the beginnings of baseball, all the way back to  1776, this book claims.  For Baseball Historians this is a priceless work,  although it would have been helpful to footnote all of the sources, and the  other reviewer is correct the author should have used the Official  Encyclopedia, as well as others. It's kind of like he ignored the source.	2000-05-25

This would be a good book in a historiograpy class because it traces the development of how studying the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has gone and also treats current trends as well. The book is a good book,  and is one of the good works by D. Michael Quinn.  One should be warned  however.  The title says &quot;Revisionist&quot; meaning it is probably  going to say some things that someone is not going to like, so keep the  title in mind when you read this book. Also since the authors make it plain  that this is a &quot;Revisionist&quot; work it would behoove the honest  researcher to go find out what the authors are attempting to revise,  meaning don't take this book as gospel, but find out both sides of the  story before you come to conculsions about the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-Day Saints.	2000-05-25

This book details some of the ways a person can overcome problems in finding meaningful relationships.  For example, if you are shy, Burns has you do activities that involve you interacting with people. He teaches you  how to flirt.  His advice is often common sense, for example if you don't  bathe or comb your hair very often he tells you to bathe and comb every  day. Burns also teaches you ways to set your expectations at realistic  levels in order to minimize painful emotional episodes, for example I'm not  going to try to date Christie Brinkley, she's &quot;out of my league&quot;,  so I'm not hurt that she doesn't want to date me. (That's just an example,  I do not know her personally, nor have ever asked her out).  The only  problem with this book is that at times it focuses on shallower aspects of  relationships, like flirting, and appearance and gives the reader the  impression that he views these aspects as more important. I believe Dr.  Burns meant this book to be a basic level guide to relationships, meaning,  that he has you concentrate on shallower aspects of relationships in hopes  that it will be easier for you to develop more meaningful relationships.   The reader should take from this book what he/she needs and drop the rest.  For example, I had no problem flirting, so I ignored his pages on that and  focused on a couple of other items that he addressed.	2000-05-25

Of course, some controversial subjects are broached, polygamy, masonry, etc. but these were a part of life in Nauvoo  so to shrink away from discussing them would have been to completley  distort Nauvoo during the 1840's.

The author does a wonderful job of first determining which women were actually, strongly documented wives of Joseph Smith, then those that there is some evidence for, then some where it is just heresay. He then organizes  the book by bascially writing biographical sketches of each wife, including  as much of there own story as possible. These women are portrayed without  either praising or condeming them. This book is recommend for anyone who  really wants to know about the Prophet Joseph Smith's polygamous activites.	2000-05-25

This work effectivley demonstrates how oppressive Asian nations have attempted to justify their rule using Confucian concepts to argue that western ideas about human rights do not apply to them.  The author clearly  demonstrates that Confucian principles are not inherently in conflict with  western ideas about human rights, despite the cultural differences that do  exist between &quot;Western&quot; philosophy and &quot;Eastern&quot;  philosophy about the individual and the state.  The only weakness in the  book is its pretentious style. I mean do you really have to have a sentence  that is seven lines long?

The book also has several  Journals written by Joseph Smith about his life and the early LDS church.

The book is well researched and the writing for once isn't tedious, (good job Dr. Quinn). However, Quinn really strains it at times to prove his ideas. This is Quinn's hidden agenda: The Mormon church during the 19th  century was not as homophopic as it is now, therefore the Mormon church  should not be so severe in its attacks and excommunications of Gay members  of the church like myself.  Quinn's whole purpose in writing this book is  to try to say that the current LDS leaders are hypocrites because earlier  leaders had more lenient attidutes towards homosexuality. The book is a  good history of same-sex relations but the reader needs to be aware of the  hidden agenda and the bias in Quinn's historical research and writing.	2000-05-25

The book's  conclusions are well argued and the documents are used in a fair and  balanced way.  Brooks also does an effective job of discussing the  background of the massacre with clear chapters on the &quot;Mormon  War&quot; of 1857 that was coming.  Unlike many authors, Brooks overcomes  the tendancy to become emotional or polemical about the massacre.  Instead  of using the book to further her own agenda, (either to be an apologist or  what is called an &quot;Anti-Mormon&quot; and tear down the church), Brooks  attempts to bring to light not only the massacre itself but the motivations  behind it and the cover-up that happened afterwards.  Anyone studying the  Mountain Meadows Massacre need to read this book first or at least second  or their research is woefully incomplete!	2000-05-24

This book simply show the effects of porno on malebehavior. Is a South African female being murdered for pleasure the same as Pamela Anderson Lee posing nude for playboy, no, of course not. BUT the fact that women like Lee pose nude to gratify their own greed for money, and men's selfish lusts creates an environment where women can be objectified to the point where a female servant can be murdered for pleasure.  This book very nicely presents the research that suggests that pornography has a profound effect on how women are viewed and treated, and that there is a connection between women who willingly participate and those that do not.  For example perverts that are steeped in the garbage of pornography use women like Pamela Anderson Lee and other porn stars as an excuse for victimizing women, they say, &quot;well if Lee likes it then this girl must&quot;.  The above reviewer in New York takes a very liberal view towards porno. The book was well written and well researched. Did some of the connections seem strained (i.e. those that are willing participants and those that aren't? Maybe to the liberal mind who is afraid of offending anyone by taking a stand on a moral issue.  Should feminists marginalize those in the porn industry? No, they should speak for all women and should work for the betterment of all women. Yet, the research clearly shows that women are harmed by pornography as well as men, that is why feminists fight so hard against the porn industry. This book is a VERY zealous effort in that direction.	2000-05-23

The only problem with the book is that it at  times strays from the interviews into philosophical musings that are  tedious. but the book as a whole is worth while and a must for anyone  studying Japan.	2000-05-23

The author did an excellent review of major currently used high school texts to tell us what's wrong with how we view our history.  This is a book for everyone who  wants to know what history is and how its done.  High School teachers must  read this and implement it into thier teaching--history teachers that is!

However, the authors seemed to have gotten stuck telling one side of the story.  They started out very balanced especially through the first few chapter but you  can see a slow downward spiral into conclusions that are based on one-sided  arguements. By the end of the book they are clearly siding with those who  think the Mormon church is non-Christian, and evil. They do have a point  though, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is different from  the Apostate &quot;mainline&quot; christian churches out there because it  teaches doctrines that were lost for centuries and that should be  celebrated.  The authors need to go back and tell more of the other side of  the story in order to be what they claim to be--disinterested observers.	2000-05-22

My wife has told me about this McDonald case and I finally read &quot;Fatal Justice&quot;.  From just reading this one book on the subject it appears that McDonald is innocent. It is persuasivley argued and I  believed well written. I enjoyed reading it, and found myself asking  &quot;How does the other side respond to this author's arguments&quot; and  that is what a good book is supposed to do. It's supposed to get you to  have an emotional reaction to the subject, to make you interested, to  create a desire to find out more about the subject. This book does all  that.  Those who find him guilty should consider this book before coming to  a final judgement, just as I'm going to read other books on the case before  I come to a final judgement.	1999-12-20

I read this book for a philosophy of history class as a student at college.  If you do not like philosophy and are easily distracted when reading mind-numbing abstractions then do not pick up this book.  The  thesis, or point, of the chapters are convoluted and seem to meander  everywhere.  I could read a chapter twice and still not have a clue what  the author was saying. I can't comment on how persuasive his arguements are  because I'm still not sure what he is saying. If you like philosophy then  this book is for you becuase the author launches off into a universe of  abstractions and shades that make one go insane, thus the title of his  book.	1999-12-18

I was dismayed though that the other reviews I read all thought this was worthy of 5 stars.  Some of Bolton's arguments are flawed and using some of  his techniques may lead to greater conflict. On one part of his work he  seems to be saying that compromise is bad, and you are weak if you  compromise.  Not compromising has led to many of the armed conflicts that  we have seen, (I will concede that compromising TOO much is weak), but some  compromise especially in a marriage faciliates greater harmony, and opens  up the possibility for greater communication between spouses.  I feel the  reader needs to &quot;read between the lines&quot; to really see what  Bolton's philosophy is.  The reader should take what is good out of this  book and use it.	1999-12-18

The book focuses on the development of the Mormon church from its small beginnings to the 10.5 million members it has today.  Her arugement is that Mormonism is a new religious tradition in the sense that it grew outside of  the mainstream Protestantism of America in the 1830's.  She argues that  although it has aspects of Old Testament Judaism and New Testament  Christianity the Mormon church should be considered another Religious  tradition that is developing into a world religion. Overall the book is  persuasive, but I found some of the logic or proofs strained and hard to  follow. It is favorable towards the church and does tend to gloss over the  controversial parts of the LDS faith.	1999-12-17

I found it somewhat persuasive in its arguments, however some of the primary sources that he uses could be interpreted differently. I've read a couple of reviews that said after  reading Quinn's work they left the LDS church, that is unfortunate because  Quinn is not the final word on the topics he treats. One should always look  at author's who offer a different picture using the same primary sources  that Quinn uses.  Also, one could argue that Quinn is a biased historian  since he was excommunicated from the church he is writing about.  It's like  writing a book about the IRS just after they've audited you and took  everything you had. Would your book be considered objective? Apply that  logic to Quinn's work and enjoy.	1999-12-10

It is this man's opinon. He is not a prophet. His authority is &quot;20 years of teaching sunday school&quot;.  Some of his assertions border on fantasy. The true test of this man's  opinons is found in the scripture, where the prophets say that the way to  know if a man is a true prophet is if the things he says come to pass. We  DO need to be prepared but Mr. Young instills a false sense of hysteria and  paranoia. He uses many scriptures, but in the end Mr. Young merely  speculates on them. Probably the most true part of this book is his  discussion of a prophecy by George Albert Smith. We should listen to the  prophets and heed their counsels, especially if they go against what Mr.  Young has here stated in his book. Be prepared, but not paranoid!	1999-10-26

The authors are very capable men. The book is at least an attempt to objectivly explain one's own religon without attacking another's religion.  I've found that often Christians think that the only way to share their own  religion is to attack others. For Mormons it is a good course in  understanding other christians. For evangelicals it is a good way for them  to learn that Christ intended his Gospel to be shared with love, not by  tearing others down, but building them up.  However Ultimatley this book is  only these two men's opinon. Robinson can in no way speak for 10 million  Mormons living today, not to mention the millions that have lived since  1830. As A Mormon I sometimes found Robinson more interested in trying to  ignore real differences in the religions. There are differences between  Mormons and evangelicals, otherwise God would not have saw fit to inspire  Joseph Smith to restore the true gospel of Jesus Christ.  And I'm sure  Blomberg doesn't speak for the who know's how many Evangelical Christians,  or Christians in general there are. Overall its a good book, it probably  glosses over differences in order to make the thesis of the book fit, but  an intelligent reader can easily see where they are straining to find  common ground where there is probably none.	1999-10-24
