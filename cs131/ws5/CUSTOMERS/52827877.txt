I am dealing with big health issues and relate on many many levels to much of what she talks about.  Her wit and self-deprecating humor, combined with her honesty about the stuff that isn't funny makes this book really ring true for me.	2002-05-12

However, it was pretty depressing.  I'm not sure if I would recommend it to anyone else just because I didn't leave with a feeling that I had learned anything or been made better by reading it.  It just seemed dreary and depressing.  Left me with the feeling of &quot;what's the point of it all?&quot;	2002-05-11

This is a nice little memoir and made me want to enter some contests myself.	2002-05-11

I tried and tried to like it, but it was just too dense and there wasn't enough reward to keep going.  It reminded me a bit of the The Fountainhead, only the story isn't as good and the characters aren't nearly as interesting.  They are somewhat intriguing.  That's what kept me coming back to it, but after I'd made it halfway through without ever getting to anything that &quot;hooked&quot; me in, I decided it wasn't worth the effort.	2002-05-11

My sister had read it and just raved and raved about it.  I started and felt like I was just plodding along.  But about halfway through, I finally got caught up in the characters and the plot.  I was incredibly unhappy with the resolution.  This is one of those &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot; books where you just want to shake the stupid characters and ask what they were thinking.  I was not happy with the ending at all.  But it was a good read overall.	2002-05-11

It doesn't take long to read, but it will stay with you for a while afterwards.  I have passed it on to several friends and family and everyone has loved it.  The characters feel real and you want to know what's going to happen to them.  It's fun to imagine that this is really how the painting came about.	2002-05-11

The main character was funny and irreverent.  I particularly liked the passage where she told her maid where the children were (&quot;oh, one's out back playing with knives, another has been kidnapped by Indians, and the third is in the living room playing with the scissors).  But once she goes from her life into the forest to search for the lost little girl, the story really does ramble.  I was quite bored with it.  I finished the book, but only because I wanted to find out if they ever found the lost girl.  I was glad to be through when I did finish and could move on to something better.	2002-04-24

It is appropriate for most people with chronic illness, although it does focus on &quot;invisible chronic illness&quot;.  I was impressed that there were few places that made me want to roll my eyes and toss the book across the room.  Usually books like this are filled with cheesy advice, such as &quot;take time out for yourself&quot; and &quot;a good bubble bath can do wonders for your psyche&quot;.  This one is written on a more intelligent level and talks about the real issues and challenges that face people with chronic illness and their caregivers.	2002-04-24

However, there has to be some redeeming value to the story to make it worth the effort of slogging through.  I do not want to be left, as I was with this book, with the feeling that it's all pointless.  That everything [stinks] and there's no point in trying, because it's all meaningless anyway.  It is well-written, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one, but certainly not worth all the buzz that it has received.	2002-04-24

As with all of Chris Bohjalian's novels, this one sucked me right in and kept me enthralled the whole way through.  I love his use of words.

I remember that I read the book, but even after listening to them talk about it, I could not remember what the book was about.  Only after coming and reading some of the Amazon reviews did I remember the plot.  Frankly, I read it quickly and forgot it just as quickly.  It didn't resonate with me.  Tragedy and turmoil.  It was entertaining while I was reading it, but not enough to stick with me.	2002-04-06

However, were it not for the connection to Sept. 11, there would be little reason for this book to exist.  While I'm sure these emails were interesting and informative to friends and family, they are really very tedious.  I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that the financial situation of the family made it difficult to relate to them - stories about birthday parties filled with nannies and hired companions did not make me feel sympathy for the family.  It made me wonder what happened to those people who weren't lucky enough to be rich in addition to being victims of terror.	2002-04-06

It was a wonderful story.  It reminded me of a good Oprah's book club selection.  I loved the characters and wanted to find out what was going to happen next.  I wanted to eat a fried baloney sandwich with them.  It's sometimes hard to like novels when bad things happen to characters that you like, but this had a good balance between bad things and good things.  I also liked the way that it wrapped up in the end.	2002-04-06

It was the only one that they had at the library, and I am so glad that I started with it.  Hilarious characters.  As my sister said, it's like Carl Hiassen without the morality lesson attached.  Great fun and it will definitely lead you to Moore's other books, which are equally enjoyable.  Plus it's just so much fun to say the name when people ask you what you are reading!	2002-04-06
US	52827877	R41PVBMT14Y3	0375414819	366389334	A Fine Balance	Books	5	4	7	N	N	Intriguing, entertaining, and thought-provoking	Oprah didn't sell this one very well when she announced it on her show.  All she said was that it was set in India and that it was good.  And it is, but it is so much more than that.  I was sucked into it from the beginning, despite having misgivings about whether or not I wanted to read it.  Many of Oprah's choices seem to be depressing, so I was wary.  Although there are some awful things that happen to the characters in this book, it never left me feeling depressed.  I felt for the characters, but I also felt that there was hope and happiness just around the corner.  I really liked reading about the daily life of the characters.  It was a glimpse into a world that I had never really thought about.  It made me grateful for what I have.  It made me respect how hard it is just to survive in other places in the world.	2002-01-17

It follows generations of women through their lives as they struggle with surviving slavery and the brutality of the men in their lives. I kept getting sucked into the story of each character only to be devastated as the character was sold away from her family.  I thought the author did a marvelous job of capturing the terrible heartbreak that these women went through.	2002-01-17

It reminded me of &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;.  I liked the strong women characters.  The healing gift storyline was intriguing to me, but I was disappointed because it seemed to fall to the wayside in the latter half of the book as the lovelife of the characters took over.  The story was a little bit predictable, but overall it was an enjoyable experience.	2002-01-16

I remember my parents reading it to me.  I remember reading it myself, searching through the pages to find Wallace and all of the other characters.  I am so glad that they have re-issued it, as it was out of print for a while.  When I re-read this as an adult, I realized that the zookeeper was actually &quot;letting&quot; Wallace escape.  There is so much humor that I missed as a child.  Looking through the scenes to find the characters and following the evolution of their stories is fun for both child and adult.  Even if your child can't read the words on her own, she can look at the pictures and try to find everyone.  And if you do have to read it to her over and over, you will not be bored to tears.	2002-01-06

I loved all of the characters and enjoyed finding out what was going to happen next.	2001-11-27

When I finally got it, I wished I'd read it sooner.  The story is very twisty, especially the latter half.  I read it very quickly, but I was just a little disappointed with the ending.  All in all, it was a good read.	2001-11-27

It's hard to recommend this book to people because they hear what it's about and almost universally think that they don't want to read about it - religious fanatics handling snakes, drinking poison, plotting to kill their wives - sounds like loads of fun.  But it is!  It really is.  Dennis Covington treats this subject with a great deal of humility and respect.  He makes the characters come alive and really shows you some of what they may be thinking or feeling.  Everyone that I have convinced to read this has enjoyed it tremendously.	2001-11-27

The author's use of language makes it feel like you are listening to her tell you a story.  There were lots of times that I had to stop and read things out loud to the other people in the room because they amused me so much.  It made me remember living in a small town - both the good and the bad.  It is a great read.	2001-11-27

Get Fuzzy is right up there with Calvin and Hobbes, the Far Side, and Rhymes with Orange.  What's so funny isn't always what the characters are saying or doing, it's the WAY that they are depicted.  The expressions on their faces.  The interactions between the three of them just crack me up.  I tried turning down the corners of the pages to show my friends the ones that were especially funny and ended up with half the darn book folded over.  Definitely a great stress reliever.	2001-11-27

The book is very poorly edited, which caused me no end of distraction.  It has the feel of a religious Harlequin romance novel, although religion never really shows up.  I felt preached at.  I wanted to know what happened to the characters, but felt like I was having to slog through the poor writing and editing to f ind out.	2001-11-27
