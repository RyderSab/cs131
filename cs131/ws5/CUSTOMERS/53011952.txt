On top of the usual perils of dangerous territory, uncertain allies, finding the target, and enemies who would delight in their deaths, they start out saddled with a half-trained and fully-clueless superior officer with a horrible talent for screwing up.<br /><br />\\"Mad Mike\\" has a talent for dropping the reader into not just the action, but the *feel* of the action, and everywhere in the story, just as in the previous books, we get carried along into the minds of the characters and how their work impacts them, even as we get to read a very well-told suspense thriller. Always, right up to the end, we are forced to keep asking ourselves \\"Will they succeed?\\" and \\"How in the hell can they pull this one out of the firefight?\\" and ask those questions right along with Wade and Kyle.<br /><br />This book is well worth reading just for the Army-tours-Hell story. Be aware, though, that Williamson bestows a great gift on anyone who reads through it. For he uses his talent to place the reader into the minds of his characters and shows you something that, when it occurs, is a glorious thing in a life. There is the moment when a boy CHOOSES to become a man, with all the responsibility being the latter entails, and you get to see it through HIS eyes. That passage alone is worth the trip.<br /><br />Thank you, Michael.	2005-09-26

Chris Cs&eacute;jthe's background is, at least to me, wonderfully original, and the author proceeds to pile on him with living, dead, undead and half-alive adversaries and friends until it seems like the spine of the book will break from the load.<br /><br />Yet somehow, it all works, including one of the most incredible auto chase/firefight scenes I've ever read that left me stunned for long minutes after I finished the chapter, and a climax that left me unable to put the book down.<br /><br />Worth the time.  I'm going back to read the first book, \\"One Foot in the Grave\\", and I'm eagerly looking forward to \\"Habeas Corpses\\", the sequel, when it comes out in November.<br /><br />Simmons has gone on my \\"watch this writer\\" list.	2005-07-19

But, of course, not all is as it seems, and Ingrey ends up facing challenges moral, physical and, ultimately, philosophical, before his Long Night can end.<br /><br />This book has it all. Comedy high and low. Tragedy to make even the Gods weep. Treachery and forgiveness. Laughter and heartache. Mercy and vengeance. And the true horror implied by the words \\"mostly dead,\\" which for me will never again be funny. Above all, Bujold's characters are always *people*, with all the strengths and weaknesses that implies.<br /><br />Along with all of the above, this book is a most wonderful romance, as Ingrey and Ijada meet, utter strangers, and go on to find first friendship, and then love, and learn why their hearts must truly beat as one, if either is to beat at all.<br /><br />\\"Hallowed Hunt\\" is even better than \\"Paladin of Souls,\\" and I wouldn't have believed that possible before I had read it.	2005-06-02

US	53011952	R23BY15LS5I7FH	0975590324	778096654	Paradise Passed	Books	5	5	5	N	N	For All Ages	And by my title, I don't mean just from adolescents to the old. This is a book that raises issues the human race, once we get off this rock, will be dealing with until the last of the stars goes out.<br /><br />It's an odd mixture here. On one hand, it seems a lot like the \\"Winston Juveniles\\" of the mid- to late- nineteen-fifties, with a young hero thrown into major trouble, and he must either grow up or lose everything he stands to become.  On the other hand, there are serious philosophical issues raised, and, as I said, we'll be dealing with them for a long time to come.<br /><br />On the surface, it's the story of Ryan Hughes, who comes across as a boy about to become a man, and who must choose just what *sort* of man he will be.  This is complicated by the fact that, if I understood the chronology, he is about twenty-seven years old when it hits.  It's a truly delayed adolescence, made more complicated by the fact that he's spent his life from age eight aboard a slower-than-light starship, and only now, after nineteen years of voyaging, are they about to make planetfall, and he must leave the comfortable world he has known all his life, that of the starship.<br /><br />This part of the story is, as I said, a familiar theme of stories aimed at young people, and the theme is a familiar one, right up until everything goes off at a skew angle.<br /><br />The cover of the book gives part of the game away, for one of the world is inhabited by a sentient species, and to make matters a lot more complicated, they are *JUST* on the edge of discovering fire.<br /><br />We take fire for granted, our ancestors having mastered it literally megayears ago, so we tend to forget just what a change it made in us. Jerry brings this singularity back to vivid life, as the locals begin to plunge into what, if we knew all the details of our own history, would be saga that spanned centuries.<br /><br />But that's not the only complication, for we, and Ryan, are also brought face-to-facewith our responsibilities under such circumstances.  Do we intervene in another species' path?  *Are* there other ways to grow as a species besides the one we took?  Do we have the right to become teachers? Or, perhaps, Gods?<br /><br />I won't spoil the resolution here.  Anyone can read this book as a solid story of exploration and growth in a young man. But there's a lot of philosophical meat on these bones, and food for hours of thought.<br /><br />It works either way, and is equally rewarding, either way. The book didn't waste my time, and it won't waste yours either.  I highly recommend it.	2005-03-31

I'm *very* fortunate to have a wife who understands why my motto is \\"Reading is life, the rest is just maintenance.\\"  I got the book on a Thursday, and finished it on Saturday at 1AM.  The seven hours it took me to read this were seriously interrupted by maintenance.<br /><br />We tend to forget, living in what we call \\"The Land of the Free\\", that George Orwell, in 1984, summed up most of human history with the words \\"The object of power is power,\\" and that freedom, historically, is a very rare, and usually short-lived, phenomenon.<br /><br />Kratman hasn't forgotten, and he sets forth on a gripping cautionary tale clearly based on real-world events.  We get the story in small, bite-sized chunks, hopping from POV to POV so we get to see a major historical turning point from *all* the sides involved.<br /><br />I was especially taken with two things about the characters: One, the \\"good guys\\" represent a breed whose successful extermination by Political Correctness will mean the end of the country. Two, the \\"bad guys\\", all clearly based on real-world models, represent the ugly outcome when people insist on being judged by their (magnificent, shining, etc. etc.) *intentions* and NOT by the results.<br /><br />The result is a story as gripping as watching an avalance, and hoping like hell that what is good will survive it.<br /><br />My reading time is at a premium these days, but this book amply rewarded my investment.<br /><br />Thank you, Tom Kratman.  I'm *VERY* much looking forward to \\"Watch on the Rhine\\" later this year.	2005-03-30

The heroes come across as craftsmen, who care about their work in the world, their obligations both to themselves and to those they protect, and ultimately, to why their jobs are important.<br /><br />This is a book about winners, and while the ending doesn't have the slam-bang finish of \\"Scope\\", the tension level is, if anything much higher.  I read the climax with little beads of sweat on my forehead, and it certainly put the normal troubles of daily life (dodging traffic and unreasonable demands) into a new perspective.<br /><br />A fun book, solid storytelling, and it was muchly worth the time spent reading it.	2005-03-07

Everything else about &quot;Second Coming&quot; is magnificent.<br />In this book John Dalmas explores a very simple question: In the two thousand years since Joshua bar Joseph of Nazareth taught among us, what would happen if the world needed another Great Teacher?  This is not your usual science fiction premise, but in a genre which embraces everything from faster-than-light travel to bioengineering, it is a completely legitimate story premise, and Dalmas proceeds not merely to run, but to dance with it.<br />By that I mean that all of the questions which the premise question brings up find their way into the story.  What sort of messiah might we need?  What would he teach? What sort of followers would he gather?  Who would listen?  Who would neglect to listen?  Who would stop up their ears and shout &quot;La la la I can't hear you!&quot;?  Have the Great Questions changed?  Have the answers to them done likewise?  All of the above and more show up in a story filled with likeable (and despisable) people, action both spiritual and physical, stories, parables, some brief lectures, which are, after all, part of what any teacher would do, and jokes, including one so funny that I almost fell out of bed laughing.<br />This is not apocalyptic fiction, but solid food for the mind and spirit, with some of the most profound issues of philosophy explored in the course of a marvelously entertaining story. When I finished this book (at two in the morning!), I found my mind asking the oldest of all humanity's questions: &quot;OK, what happens NEXT?&quot;<br />This book is a joyous journey, well worth the time, and I'm looking forward eagerly to the promised sequel.	2004-04-02

That's not a contradiction, by the way.  Any book about alien contact where I spend the first third of it trying *NOT* to grind my teeth into powder over Jao callousness and Jao brutality has definitely involved me in the story.<br />For the Jao have conquered Earth, reducing its population to sullen subservience, destroyed cities for the merest trace of resistance, and even wiped out Mount Everest to prove that they are not to be defied. The areas which resisted most strongly have been hammered into poverty and want, and there are places where no one who collaborates with the Jao dares walk unarmed or alone.<br />But the Jao are not the monolithic Beast of the Apocalypse they seem to be, for one faction, known only as the Bond, has apparently engineered a situation they hope will resolve the mess, and so the tale begins, as a new Subcommandant arrives on earth, fresh from the equivalent of Annapolis...<br />There is more to this book than the parts of the story which aroused my wrath, for these aliens are truly *alien*, and that provides the tale with its richness.  John Campbell defined alien as \\"what thinks as well as a human, but differently\\" and the Jao are indeed different.  From those differences arise the conflict, for how do beings who are engineered, rather than products of evolution, proud of their rationality, and involved in a war for survival against others whose alienness is so bizarre that meaningful contact with them is impossible, deal with the inconsistent, irrational, maddening and quarrelsome humans?<br />For that matter, can, or will the Jao succeed in fixing the horribly botched first contact and conquest of the humans? Without breaking the very things that might make humans valuable partners in their ultimate quest for survival? And, if they can do so, how can they achive it without destroying their own species' unity, upon which the survival of all, Jao and human, must ultimately depend?<br />All of the above issues and more come into play in this book and by the time the story ended, I found myself actually trying to think like a Jao, and see the universe from their perspective.  Quite a change, I must say, from my \\"kill them all\\" attitude generated by the early part of the story. That change is a high compliment to the skill with which the story was unfolded before me.<br />Both K. D. Wentworth (\\"Black/On/Black\\", \\"Stars/Over/Stars\\", \\"Imperium Game\\") and Eric Flint [website]BR>have shown themselves writers of the highest caliber, and this book, written by them as a team, is a credit to them both. I am grateful the book was so difficult and hence, so wonderful.<br />Thank you, Kathy and Eric.	2003-08-20

After that, things get weird! :)<br />And very very funny.  This is a magnificently well-paced book, as the reader is led to just how deep is the slok our Heroes are standing in, and how carefully they must work their way out of it lest they do even more damage in the process. (Take a look at a city block after Superman's been fighting in it, and you'll see what I mean.)  The prose is deft, the characters involving, the villains villainous, the belly laughs plentiful, the plot thickening superb and, as a bonus, there is some excellent wisdom to be found in just WHY our heroes are so careful.<br />This story has made it onto my &quot;Gotta RE-read this&quot; list, and these days, given that I can't even begin to Keep Up With Them All, that list is the highest honor I can give a book.<br />Thank you, Ms. Elrod.

This is a magic book, and I don't just mean that it involves magical artifacts, cantrips, quests, errands of mercy, dirty politics with and without sorcery, showmanship, spirituality, sibling rivalry, plots, counter-plots, and, oh, yes, the kitchen sink.<br />It starts off slowly, with Edwina Godz children going on a quest to take over the family business.  There's lots of glitz and glamor as the kids take off to sell themselves to the big clients as THE great hope of the future, and along the way...<br />Let's just say that there's real life, and then there's REAL life, and the book gets into both without ever losing the light touch. As just one example, there's a Teddy Bear who makes sarcasm into a High Art.  We watch as the kids get the comfortable illusions that have sustained them for years get stripped away, and with each chapter and revelation, the quest gets sharper and more real until...<br />But then, that would be telling, and I don't want to spoil it.<br />These days, I generally don't have time to re-read books, but THIS one goes back in the stack to be gone/lived/dreamed/laughed/wept through again.

There are courage, adventure, challenges, humor both high and low, joy, sorrow, wisdom and folly in each of the stories.<br />You don't necessarily need to have read any of the other books in the Honor Harrington collection, either the four previous multi-author anthologies or the (so far) ten novels by David Weber, to appreciate these stories, either.  Each could stand proudly alone, but together, they form a splendid show of lights, each one illuminating events only hinted at elsewhere in the other books.<br />In Jane Lindskskold's \\"Promised Land\\", we find out that the Manticorean Royal Family is truly *royal*, as the Crown Prince fights to keep innocents alive in the heat of his first battle.<br />Timothy Zahn's \\"With One Stone\\" shows the gift that being in the right place at the right time can be, and change forever the course of history.<br />John Ringo and Victor Mitchell show us the military equivalent of Siberia, where wit and grace are as much survival tools as discipline.<br />Ringo then returns with \\"Let's Go to Prague,\\" which had me both laughing like hell and scared likewise, sometimes both at the same time. Warning: do NOT read this story in public, or when you break out into laughter, you may find people edging away from you and eyeballing you for sharp objects. :)<br />Then we see, in Eric Flint's \\"The Fanatic\\", both the price AND the cost of duty and power, and the toll each can exact on even the most honorable of men and women.<br />And last, Honor's creator himself gives us the title story \\"The Service of the Sword,\\" as we watch a young Grayson woman, determined to follow in Honor's footsteps, find out just how BIG the boots that made those tracks must be.<br />Any ONE of the stories in this volume make it worth buying.

Unlike its predecessor,  1632, this book is a solid foundation for what I hope will be a long, long series.<br />1632 was a stand-alone, but when it proved popular, Eric Flint did the smart thing and, with David Weber (no mean series writer himself), used this to A: tell a solid, interesting story and B: lay a lot of the groundwork for future books, short stories and a whole \\"1632verse\\" alternate history.<br />Fine by me.  This book isn't as fast-paced as 1632, since it's a \\"foundation stone\\" type novel, but it gives a lot of the \\"surround\\", political background, TONS of new villainy, and the feel of the massively confused game of \\"musical chairs played with a death penalty\\" that is pretty much a hallmark of human history wherever and whenever.<br />The necessary downside in the writing is more exposition, slower pace, and less character development.  The upside is that we end up with, waiting in the wings, the Dutch insurrection, the Scottish revolt, Cromwell's Revenge, \\"1634: The Baltic War\\"(next book), The French and Indian War, and my personal favorite, \\"The Spanish Inquisition doesn't know WHAT to expect.\\"<br />All told, this book was a solid investment of my money and even more, my precious time.  I trust Eric Flint and David Weber, and even if we do spend a fair amount of time in this book watching them stuff dynamite into a lot of holes in the rock, I am certain that, sooner or later, we will get our reward: an earth-shattering \\"KABOOM!\\" The added benefit from this book is, we'll know WHY the rubble is bouncing.	2002-08-06

I generally don't like David Drake's stuff and haven't read the third story in this book.  He concentrates too much on the ugly and nasty of war to the point that it destroys my enjoyment.  If I want ugly, I can just turn on the 6 o'clock news.<br />However, the other two stories in this volume were well worth my time and money.  The editorial review on this page pretty well sums up the stories' overall themes, but it doesn't do justice to their content.<br />&quot;Ms. Midshipman Harrington&quot; takes us to Honor's first cruise, and we see her when she is just beginning to find out that, while command talent may be inborn, it must be annealed and honed by life. It's David Weber's usual solid &quot;What comes next?&quot; storytelling, and it kept me going from beginning to a very satisfying ending.<br />&quot;Islands&quot; is the truly great and rare jewel.  We get to watch BOTH Anna AND Calpodius grow in the forge of their adversities, and watch them deal with a world in which women are sold in marriage as chattels by learning to deal with the challenge of being human partners not by merely discarding or rebelling against the world's rules, but by choosing to stand boldly above them, molding their own lives to their own wills and hearts.  Legends are made of equal parts work, courage, and love, and I will be returning to this legend again and again in years to come.  Thank you, Eric.	2002-05-06

This latest book certainly adds weight to that impression.<br />This is the second in a pair of books plotted by David Drake involving the battle computer, Center, its guide to things human, Raj Whitehall, and their chosen instrument to save a planet which otherwise has no future, Adrian Gellert. The first book was \\"The Reformer\\", and it was fairly readable, but S. M. Stirling is only a fair writer.<br />*THIS* book, on the other hand, blazes with drama, comedy, political intrigue, hatred and revenge, love and laughter. Just about everything, in fact, that makes being alive so intriguing. I came to care deeply about all of the characters, and all of them brought perspective on what it might be like to live in a time when the old must die that the new may be born, and each player must decide for him- or herself whether to attempt midwifery or murder, or both.  I found in this book two paragraphs filled with such insight that I deem the cost of this book, in both money and time reading, amply repaid by them. (I'll let you find them rather than spoil the beautiful surprises.)  The rest of the book is a bonus from a master storyteller.<br />Thank you, Eric.	2002-03-25

Sprague deCamp and Fletcher Pratt created &quot;The Incomplete Enchanter&quot;, the beginning of a series of wonderful romps in which modern humans got dropped into alternate worlds where myth and magic were real and the Norse Gods just happened to be heading into Ragnarok.  After that first episode, things got REALLY weird. The stories have since gone on to become classics.<br />Now Flint and Freer have revived this tradition of riotous fun.  Our unlikely band of heroes consists of a U. of Chicago Professor who specializes in ancient myths, a lady guest researcher from South Africa who happens to be A: stacked, B: very tough and C: has a purse which is a survival kit in itself,<br />and a couple of bewildered U.S. Army soldiers, all of whom have been drafted for a trip through both Greek and Egyptian mythologies.  I'll save you from having to guess: EVERYTHING surrounding them is a death trap and the Gods themselves are looking for our band's collective butts.<br />How they deal with all of this, figure out whattheheck is really going on, cope with the REAL heroes behind the Iliad, etc, and try to get out with minimal damage, was a barrel of laughs.  There are some events in the &quot;outside world&quot;, as well, involving serious disrespect for Established Authority that were worth the reading even without our heroes' doings.<br />This one is in my permanent collection.

With the publication of the fifth volume of the &quot;Belisarius' War&quot; hexalogy, there is very little doubt that Flint has forged a modern saga, full of sly (and wry) humor, courage, glory, love, hate treachery, honor,  tragedy, and grief.  Everything that makes life worth living.<br />All of our friends are back to fight another round against the Great Evil (no, not Microsoft).  If they lose, mankind will know an age of darkenss that will never lift.  But they battle with courage and with their minds in this volume.  It was a true pleasure to watch each and every one of the major characters not merely planning on how to fight, but also on how to &quot;win the peace.&quot;  In other words, to achive not just a military victory against the Great Enemy, but to build the foundation for a lasting and just peace for all involved, including the Malwa's victims.  This is a lesson that our world lost in the last century, and paid for it in unnecessary warfare and too much spilled blood.<br />All of our friends are here.  Belisarius, his wife Antonina, Eon the nagusa nagast of Axum, his dawazz Ousanas, Irene Makrembolitassa spymistress supreme, Kungas the mask, and even the traitorous eunuch Narses all have major roles to play, plots to stage, trouble to stir up and trouble to end.<br />You do not necessarily have to have read the earlier books in the series, although having done so will add depth to your appreciation of this one.<br />I regret not one moment of the hours of pleasure I have taken in this book and the others, and when the sixth book is published, I plan to re-read them all, to appreciate a master saga about a great craftsman (Belisarius) which has been crafted by another (Flint).	2001-06-16

To the aliens, the primitive humans are useful puppets who can be used to conquer other primitive worlds.  But THESE puppets have swords, which can cut strings... and their masters' throats.<br />The stories in this volume range from non-stories like S. M. Stirling's &quot;Three Walls&quot;, which is a fairly dull run-of-the-action description of a battle, turned into a story only by a throwaway moment at the end which warns of what is to come in the final story.<br />There's also &quot;A Clear Signal&quot;, which doesn't really feel as if it fully belongs in this book, since the political circumstances described don't match anything else, nor do the Romans even get mention.  It's not a bad story, but it really belongs elsewhere.<br />Drake himself contributes &quot;Lambs to the Slaughter&quot;, which I'd call the sprightliest tale in the book, being how one underofficer, known to all and sundry as &quot;Froggie&quot;, manages to outwit both his masters and his enemies.  I laughed like hell at the ending of this one, and Drake doesn't usually do that for me.<br />David Weber contributes &quot;Sir George and the Dragon,&quot; which serves both as solid entertainment and as a reminder that humans are dangerous, whether they be Romans or English, and a tribute to what has probably been the finest weapon of battle ever created, the English Longbow.<br />Finally, Eric Flint's &quot;Carthago Delenda Est&quot; is the treasure of this volume, and it was worth getting this volume for this story alone, even without Weber and Drake's work.  I don't want to spoil it, but read the other stories first, then read &quot;Carthago.&quot; The beauty of this one is that you have toread the story to understand both why and how it ends, and in my case, it took me a few seconds to puzzle it out, but the reward for doing so was to know true joy.<br />Well worth the time invested.	2001-05-22

Kathy Wentworth has a real gift for bringing situations and people to life, including even the sketch-glimpses we get of the flek, and the color-sketch of the Laka.<br />I really liked the development of character in this book.  Blackeagle and Mitsu both overcome major limitations in their mind-sets and grow to meet new challenges, and I had a lot of fun following the ways events kept backfiring on the flek. Even the minor characters such as Kei were worth knowing, and it was fun watching each of them deal with the mess into which they were pitched.<br />About the only negative comment I have is that the cover isn't nearly as good as the one for &quot;Black/On/Black&quot;, which was much more evocative.  This cover is truer to the content of the story, but definitely not as much of a sales point.  I bought the dead tree &quot;B/O/B&quot; on the basis of the cover alone, then got blown away by the story in that book.  You don't, by the way, have to have read the first book in order to follow this one, but you'll have a lot of fun if you do.<br />I sincerely hope this won't be the last we see of the *Avalanche/In/Motion* pattern that are Heyoga Blackeagle and Mitsu.	2001-02-15

Hogan's best works have always been about science and scientists exploring the universe, finding out how it ticks, and being surprised not so much by what they find as by the byproducts of what they find.  In this story, a machine which can send signals back in time is invented, and the rest of the story revolves around three key questions: &quot;Exactly how does it work?&quot;, &quot;What does it mean about the way the universe works?&quot;, and finally, &quot;How do we use it wisely?&quot;<br />Hogan's characters quickly became friends, and I got thoroughly caught up in their quest for answers, some of which, as you would expect, are kept secret until right up to the very end, which includes one of the most gorgeous juxtapositions of &quot;Surprise!&quot; with &quot;Of course!&quot; I've ever read.

It's books like this that make me a loyal Baen Books reader.<br />John Ringo has crafted a universe in which some aliens, themselves incapable of violence or, apparently, military strategy, have decided to use humans as literal &quot;army ants&quot; to destroy some other aliens who have been taking their worlds away from them one by one.  And, of course, once the job is done and we're no longer needed...<br />Of course humanity has long had a history of wriggling out of binds and generally playing merry hell with expectations made of it, and in this book, we are no different.  I won't spoil the fun, but it's interesting seeing Ringo deal simultaneously with High Strategy and Low Tactics at the same time, while giving us characters we can care about and follow around as they attempt to keep humanity alive.<br />This is the first book in what promises to be a series well worth following.  The ending ties up the current set of loose ends very neatly, but I'm already salivating in anticipation of the sequel, which will be out in April, 2001, and I've already bought my &quot;webscription&quot; copy.<br />Read it and enjoy.

I persevered right up to the massively  unsatisfying ending, which essentially amounted to saying &quot;OK, that's  the background, I'll start the *story* in the next volume.&quot;  I was not  amused.<br />I suspect that what I'm going to do is wait for the *rest* of  the series to appear and then read the other volumes as a group, assuming  Chalker doesn't tedious them out again just to fill a length requirement.  However, my personal take is that I'll wait for them all in paperback  before I start.<br />Chalker is justly famous for the richness of his  creations.  The &quot;Well World&quot; saga is as rich as the Bayeux  Tapestry, and the &quot;Four Lords of the Diamond&quot; a Bokhara Carpet.

Maybe it's not a good idea going back and looking at your old reviews, but I couldn't resist the temptation, and I'm paying the price now.<br /><br />I'd very much like to add at least a couple of stars to my rating of this book, because I realized later that this was the book that got me back into reading David Drake's stories and becoming a staunch fan. At the time I wrote this, I was still in a bad state from what I've come to realize is the only story David has ever written that I didn't enjoy, \\"Interrogation Team.\\" And it does say something for his power as a writer that I had that reaction to the story.<br /><br />But that doesn't change the fact that I've enjoyed every book in this series, as well as a number of others David has written in other universes, and, by coincidence, as I write this update, I've just finished an advance copy of his next RCN novel, \\"In the Stormy Red Sky,\\" which is due out in June from Baen. I loved it, and it's going to get five stars when I review it.<br /><br />David, I apologize for the review below. You really didn't deserve it for this book. I leave it below so that all will know that its own author disowns it.<br /><br />+++++++++++++++<br /><br />I'm *NOT* a big David Drake fan.  Usually, his stories, particularly the Slammers, have left me feeling as if I'd been dropped into the Augean Stables and then left for the stuff to dry on me.  Those of his characters  I've met generally belong on any reasonable \\"Shoot to kill on  sight!\\" list.<br /><br />This one is at least somewhat better, in that it  didn't revolt me and I don't feel any particular urge to drown both of the  major characters as a favor to humanity.  As a matter of fact, I managed to  finish the book, which is the first for a Drake novel in years.<br /><br />Why did I  try this book?  Because of the Belisarius series by \\"Drake and  Flint\\" (An Oblique Approach, In the Heart of Darkness, Destiny's  Shield, and Fortune's Stroke, so far).  I figured maybe Drake mighthave  improved.  He has.  Like I said, I finished the book, and the roughly $1.75  I paid for my copy was worth it.	2000-06-23

This is the fifth Eric Flint book I've read.  I suppose it's possible that some day he'll write a bad book, but I won't be able to review it because the shock will have killed me.<br />This one didn't disappoint me in the  least.  Belisarius doesn't figure as centrally in this one as in the  previous three books, simply because Flint gives more room to the  vitally-needed Rome-Axum alliance and to Shakuntala, Rhagunath Rao, and the  Deccan Revolt. With the possible exception of Churchill, nobody has ever  changed the course of a war single-handed, and even Belisarius can't manage  this one alone.  Fortunately, Belisarius has friends, without whose help he  would find himself out on the end of a long tree limb, and find the Malwa  standing behind him with chainsaws. Antonina, Eon, Ousanas, Shakuntala,  Irene Makrembolitassa, Kungas, and Rhagunath Rao are all people well worth  spending time with. I'd have liked to see a bit more of Byzantium and  what's going on back there in this book, but that can wait.  We'll be going  back.<br />The really neat thing about this book is that Flint understands  that, while wars aren't won without combat, the true battle is always in  people's minds and souls.  Two scenes in the book bring this out starkly.  In one scene (no spoilers here) Belisarius does more damage to the Malwa in  ten minutes with his wits, wisdom and words, than in the entire Battle of  Charax.  He did it so neatly that I didn't even realize the Malwa had been  stabbed through the belly until the book was almost over.  In the other  scene, we encounter the *true* depths of the Malwa evil.  The key section  occupied only two paragraphs, but when I finished them, I felt as if  somebody had dripped icewater down my spine.  This is *writing*!<br />The  book is, of course, part of a series, so we don't see how the whole story  comes out, but the ending, like those of the earlier books, is both  logically and emotionally satisfying.  We are allowed to rejoice with ourfriends even as we realize that the REAL work lies ahead.<br />There are now  three living authors whose new books I'm willing to buy sight unseen on the  strength of their names.  Poul Anderson, Lois McMaster Bujold, and now,  Eric Flint.  Once more, thank you Eric. I'm looking forward to the next  Belisarius book,  to &quot;Rats, Bats and Vats&quot; later this year, and  &quot;1633&quot; next year.  Peace and blessings.	2000-06-15

Your mission, should you decide to accept it, will be to lead your armies against overwhelming force led by the ultimate evil.  If you lose, commit suicide, for humanity will enter an  age of darkness that will never lift. If you or any of your companions are  caught, you will face slow death by hideous torture. This message from the  future will *NOT* self-destruct because you will *need* everthing it can  teach you.  Good luck.<br />With this, the third (of four so far) book in the  series, the overall structure of the story is now plain.  We get to watch  Belisarius, his wife Antonina and their friends, like the I.M. force, begin  forging a boom to lower on the Malwa.  The true pleasure of this series is  that it's on a much larger, far more beautiful, and incomparably better  painted canvas. You don't HAVE to read the earlier books to follow the  story.  Eric Flint intersperses enough of a situation report into the tale  that you can jump in and pretty much figure out what's going on.  However,  there is a lot of the fun getting to know these people over the course of  several books.<br />As seems to be his habit, Flint's writing is superb, and  the people, places, time and battles are well-drawn.  Again, as always,  there are wonderfully memorable scenes, including one particular sequence  where Antonina comes into her own.  If Belisarius is a Craftsmaster of War,  she is a Cook, seasoning the siege of an impregnable fortress with a dash  of force and a soupcon of violence in a display of lateral thinking that  left me dumbfounded, admiring, awestruck, and laughing like hell.<br />Start  to finish, this book is a pure delight, and I get to start on number four  at once!  I have only one complaint: I agree that - the maps could be  better, since much of the ground of the story is unfamiliar to those of us  who are not historians.<br />As always, Eric, thank you for hours of reading  pleasure.	2000-06-07

Every superlative in the language would merely be redundant.  I was hooked from the first page and by reading the first book in the series, and watching characters  who have become my friends  as they work, play, hope, scheme, dream, love,  hate and fight against the background of a world in the shadow of monstrous  evil.<br />As always, Flint's people are superbly drawn, and there are scenes  and times in this book I will return to again and again.  This book is a  treasure of graceful writing, with the battle scenes, while accurately  done, not done with unnecessary nastiness.<br />This book is the second in a  series of which four have now been published.  Even so, the ending, while  clearly aiming at a sequel, was as logically satisfying as a proof, and as  emotionally satisfying as listening to Sarah Brightman sing.<br />This volume  is a must have, and the last paragraph on page 302 is words I will treasure  all my days.  Thank you, Eric.	2000-06-01

Drake's stories are usually nasty, and his characters people who, were they dying of thirst in  the desert, I would not spit upon them lest the moisture help them  live.<br />But *THIS*, this is Eric Flint's work I am sure, with Drake  supplying, at most, an outline.  I ran into Flint by reading his  magnificent &quot;1632&quot; and, when I learned of this series, went out  and got all the volumes.  I'm working my way through them now.<br />There  *are* parallels between this series and the Stirling/Drake  &quot;General&quot; collaboration, but while Stirling's good, Flint is  easily the master.  The writing is strong and, in places, is pure poetry. I  don't want to spoil anything, but just wait until you read &quot;How the  Monsoon Visited the Palace&quot;, and what it wrought there!<br />Flint writes  superbly, bringing all his characters to full and vivid life.  We see their  loves, their hates, their dreams and their nightmares.  Belisarius has a  cause worth fighting for and an enemy that makes the MPAA, the RIAA, and  the Nazis all rolled into one look like spiteful, spoiled children.  I  would deem it an honor to die guarding *this* Belisarius' back. Or I would  follow him to hell.  Judging by the vileness of the enemy, it looks like  I'll have that privilege before the series is over.<br />Thank you, Eric.  I  don't find stuff this good very often.  May all kindly Gods and Goddesses  watch over you and your word processor!	2000-05-25

Goin' DOWN!&quot;	Okay, the villains make cardboard look thick, the end-of-the-world genre has been &quot;done to death&quot; :), and the Kronan social model is, to be charitable about it, ridiculous.  Add to the foregoing the fact that it  took me four tries to get past the book's opening, which doesn't  (apparently) have *anything* to do with the story, and you'll understand  why, despite the fact that I'm a Hogan fan, it took a year for me to get  around to this one even after I bought the hardcover.<br />On the other hand,  I finally discovered that this book has two things going for it.  First, is  Hogan's attitude toward scientific evidence, which shines through many of  the scenes.  It can be summed up in the phrase &quot;evidence outweighs  theory,&quot; and Hogan's characters make their case without theatrics.  The second thing is the *scale* of the story.  It is uncommon for an author  to show you in your guts how having six billion voices screaming  &quot;INCOMING!&quot; simultaneously feels.<br />Once this story really got  rolling in Part Three, I was hooked.  It was like stepping on a skateboard  at the top of Mount Everest with no brakes.  At midnight, I found myself  turning &quot;just one more page&quot; and forcibly reminding myself I had  to get up early.  I had to know &quot;what comes next, what comes  next,...&quot;, and I was relating seriously to the hero, who tries  desperately to do the right thing even if it means giving up what might be  his only shot at survival. That sort of involvement is something only solid  writing can create.  To be sure, this book has its flaws and it's not  Hogan's best work, but it was worth the time and effort I put into it, and  I don't recommend starting it if you don't have the time to finish it. Like  all the rest of James Hogan's writings, it is good, solid reading.  I may  not read this one a second time, but I'm glad I read it a first.	2000-05-11

Neil Smith was the author who first got me introduced to libertarianism, and it started a friendship with the ideas and ideals of that philosophy that never wore off.  This book was a delight, not only because it finally completes the cycle &quot;Questar&quot; never finished,  but because, about halfway through the book, I had one of those wonderful  &quot;Aha!&quot; moments.  I'll describe it at the end of the review, but  that moment made my year!<br />The story is very well told.  Smith *can* be a  tad preachy, but it doesn't interrupt the flow of the story, while making  sure you understand not only WHAT happens, but WHY.  Smith has taken the  concept of alternate realities farther than anyone else, and made it a  truly living thing.  In these days, when our government waves automatic  weapons at terrified children, it's a comfort to think that *somewhere* in  the multiverse there are people, (and sea-scorpions, and nautiloids, and  ...) who HAVEN'T screwed up.  This is a book I plan to re-read, and, with  the limits on my time these days, I don't do that often.<br />As to the  &quot;Aha!&quot; moment.  One of the main characters is &quot;Eichra  Oren&quot;, a &quot;Moral Debt Assessor&quot; who is a combination of  detective, arbitrator, judge, jury, and, if need be, executioner.  It hit  me about halfway through the book that *ALL* debts are MORAL debts.  Money,  or any other form of restitution, is simply a tangible expression of that  morality.  Mr. Smith, if you read this, thank you.  A book which hits me  like this is a rare and valuable gem.	2000-05-03

Sheffield always ties each story to some neat idea or scientific concept, and then rides it all the way to its logical consequences.  Every story in this book has some really neat (no pun intended) kernel, and we  get to see how scientific thinking copes with the universe.  Only one story  in this volume (Out of Focus) is weak from that standpoint, since there is  no real explanation given for either the AI's capabilities or actions. I  don't recommend the book for characterization, either, since neither the  narrator character, nor McAndrew, come across as particularly deep.  But I  give this book four stars for bringing alive a sense of what a truly  *surprising* playground G_d has given us.  For that alone, this book is  well worth the time.	2000-04-03

I enjoyed the first two of Elizabeth Moon's &quot;Esmay Suiza&quot; books immensely.  Esmay is a very likable heroine, and she's the same sort of &quot;trouble magnet&quot; as Modesty Blaise.<br />*This* book, however, isn't  about Esmay.  It's about the assassination of a head of state, power  politics, technical problems with rejuvenation technology, a mutiny on a  prison planet, and a blood feud between the Suizas and Serranos (think  Montagues and Capulets with nuclear weapons)  Esmay herself appears in no  more than about one-sixth of this overly-long book, and she's mostly being  shoved around from pillar to post.<br />I have a feeling that Ms. Moon is  basically using this book to set the background for what I call &quot;meal  ticket series&quot; writing, where each book is milked for maximum revenue  without regard to entertainment value, and you have to buy *all* the series  to understand any of it.<br />I was greatly disappointed with this one.	1999-12-27

This one starts with a jolt of adrenalin  in the first few sentences and never lets up, right up to one of the most  moving endings I have ever read.  I've been through this one three times,  and enjoyed it every time.	1999-12-13

Even when she's writing a romantic comedy, Ms. Bujold still manages to ask Questions:  big questions, small  questions, and all sizes in between. This book made my mind itch and my  heart sing.  I can give it no higher praise.	1999-07-22
US	53011952	R1MAOFDK9FHKBH	0671578197	344226228	The Multiplex Man	Books	5	1	2	N	N	&quot;Total Recall&quot;, only *much* better	Remember the old days, when a new gadget and its implications would be explored in a science-fiction novel which had more twists than a pretzel factory?  Hogan has a ball with the idea of the electronic educator and  just how far the technology might go. On this basis, he adds a truly  satisfying thriller, throws in a quest, and garnishes this salad with some  croutons by investigating just what constitutes &quot;creator's  responsibility for his invention.&quot;  I had a ball reading the  hardcover.  Some of the politics in the book are a bit dated by events in  Eastern Europe since the book was originally published, but this book was  well worth my time in hardcover, and I plan on rereading it.	1999-06-10

I suggest getting a mouth guard before reading this book, before you grind  your teeth to powder.	1999-05-19

These days, it takes an extraordinary book to pull me away from my computer, but this one did it and with margin to spare.  It offers fascinating ideas, and a clear, thoughtful vision of what a mature Internet  might be like.  Along the way, I got to meet some wonderful people and grew  to care about them, just in time to be pushed into one of the most  thrilling and suspensful action adventures ever written.  By the time I  reached the final assault on SHIVA, I was hooked, and absolutely refused to  go anywhere until I had finished.  At every twist and turn, I just had to  find out what happened next, and watched with awe and pride the Earthweb  becoming humanity's greatest defense.<br />I understand from other comments on  Amazon that this is the first book in a trilogy.  Wonderful!  Bring them  on!	1999-05-03
US	53011952	R1S1OA1IYKEFT9	0671578081	348946541	Komarr (Miles Vorkosigan Adventures)	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Combat wasn't as tough as administration! :)	One thing Lois McMaster Bujold never does is keep doing quite the same thing each time.  Miles' predicament in this novel reminds me of a scene in Farley Mowat's &quot;Dog Who Wouldn't Be&quot; where the dog is trying to  sit on five wounded ducks at once.  He has four paws and five ducks...  Here, Miles has to solve a mystery, discover true love for the first time  in his life, learn a new profession and a couple of other things that I'll  let you find out by reading the book.  At the same time, we get a  fascinating glimpse of what it's like to watch the &quot;Dwarf  Tornado&quot; as our favorite hyperactive tries to play whack-a-mole in  real time.  As always, I had an awful lot of fun reading this book and I  absolutely can't wait for the next one, &quot;A Civil Campaign.&quot;<br />Incidentally, I've seen some complaints that Miles seems a bit  thick-headed as an Imperial Auditor. I don't agree.  In the earlier books,  Miles was leading the band.  Here, he's essentially a cop, and, as somebody  once commented, cops are historians.  They come along *after* the deeds are  done and try to cope with the mess.  That's a lot harder than combat.  I've  read this book three times, and expect to read it a few more.	1999-04-16

The typeface used is also a tad oversized, which  suggests that it was padded to make it seem like more for your  money.<br />Wait for the paperback, or the &quot;combined  edition&quot;.	1999-04-09

This book is a wonderful sequel to one of the neatest books of all time, &quot;Operation Chaos.&quot; Our heroes return to us enough older that they'll use a mirror to peek around the corner at their foes, and still  bold enough to charge the guns if that's what it takes to do the job.  In a  universe where &quot;Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable  from technology,&quot; courage and intelligence count.  There are also some  utterly delightful japes here that had me in stitches more than once.  I  came away from the bound galley I got to read richly rewarded for my time  spent.  I have also sworn an oath that when this book finally comes out, at  least one copy is *mine*.	1999-03-30

His work, however, has always had bits of what I term  &quot;arrogant liberalism&quot; acting as anti-grace notes to the story,  and this one is the worst yet. Example: &quot;And Canadians didn't like  guns, either - they had no Second Amendment, or whatever damned thing it  was that made Americans think they could go around armed.&quot;  The  product of the most profound thinkers on society and politics Earth has  ever produced is airily dismissed.  The book is studded with similar  passages, and eventually they get on the nerves.  I gave up after chapter  17 of the bound galley I read.  Even the fascinating question of whether  scientific foreknowledge precludes free will couldn't keep me in this book.	1999-03-13

So here we are, 17 years later, and the Lizard females have arrived to stir the pot.  Turtledove handles the development of a partially  alien-occupied earth well, and the characters and situations are  believable.  Not a bad read, but I *wish* Turtledove would stop re-fighting  the two ugliest wars history has ever seen and go on to something new.	1999-03-10

It's fun, lighthearted fare, and the author makes some serious points along the way about what might happen when reality and fantasy become  indistinguishable.  I found it well worth my time, and enjoyed myself along  the way.	1999-03-10
US	53011952	R3QJVEATVYBPW1	0312856393	947042753	Far Futures	Books	5	10	12	N	Y	One of the best anthologies ever published	I'm beginning to suspect that the Kirkus review service pays its people by the mudball.  Two of the stories in this book, Anderson's and Haldeman's, ended up in Dozois' &quot;Best SF of the Year&quot; anthology.  Hardly a downcheck for the writing.  For myself, I enjoyed the Anderson and Sheffield stories muchly for their breadth of scope and sense of the immense reaches of time that stretch before us.  Most of all, however, Kingsbury's contribution is a dazzling, awesome, pyrotechnic refutation of the ironfisted tyranny that has always lain within the velvet glove of Asimov's ostensibly gentle &quot;psychohistory.&quot;  The book is worth its entire weight from this story alone.  In addition, Haldeman's &quot;White Hill&quot; contributes tragedy of cosmically moving proportions.  I purchased this volume in hardcover *after* reading it from my local library.  That's not something I often do	1997-08-26

It played up every hackneyed cliche about super-agents battling aliens and then added just that little twist...<br />It was a very enjoyable read, and if the movie is as funny as the book, they'll definitely have a real winner on their hands.	1997-07-02

Weber/White don't create the deepest characters, but the book reads like a futuristic version of &quot;Victory At Sea.&quot;  The technology race is fascinating, and I found myself wondering howintheheck the Human/Orion/Gorm/etc. alliance can beat these things?  I spoke with the author, and he told me this is book one of three, so I'm just going to have to wait, darn it!  It's still an excellent read, particularly if you like techno-military science fiction	1997-07-01
