He was a 17th-century Jesuit who studied everything, collected everything, and at times seemed to know everything.  Perhaps most famously, he formulated translations for hieroglyphic inscriptions on Egyptian monuments and such; unfortunately, without the Rosetta Stone and Champollion, he was dead wrong about nearly all of this.  Nevertheless he was a fascinating figure situated at a major crossroads of Baroque intellectual culture.<br /><br />The negative about this volume is the usual one: because it is an edited volume, there still isn't any coherent argument made, nor any agreement.  Indeed, it seems that the authors duck and weave around a number of major issues, as though they think others in the book will take them up.  But since there is so little really serious scholarship readily available, this is an important addition to the little library.<br /><br />I can't really say that there are certain \\"shining stars\\" in the volume.  All the essays have strengths and weaknesses; it really depends what you're interested in.  That may seem like a cop-out, but if you know something about Kircher, you can see why it comes up: he was interested in everything, after all, and generally published on it as well.  Consequently you might be intrested in Egypt and find several essays interesting, and then think the essays on magnetism and biological wonders and Chinese very boring indeed.  But what if you care mostly about Kircher's important contributions (often via Gaspar Schott) to the study of magnetism, and care nothing about linguistics?  And so on.<br /><br />Fortunately, the volume is a relatively inexpensive paperback, so there's no reason not to buy it and dip in.  When Daniel Stolzenberg's book comes out, we'll maybe have a solid foundation to work from as well.  Now if only we could get some decent editions of Kircher's actual work in translation....	2005-04-30

The analysis itself is valuable and important, contributing to an understanding of Dee as a man deeply involved with his political and social environment, as well as clarifying the ways in which Dee read his sources. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Sherman goes overboard in attacking all previous scholarship on Dee, particularly what he calls the \\"Yatesian\\" approaches (in reference to Frances Yates).  He never wastes an opportunity to attack, implying at times that his predecessors did not really read Dee but rather constructed a myth (of the magus) about him. <br /> <br />While it is certainly true that Yates overstated her thesis, she saw a good deal in Dee that was accurate.  And without a thorough reevaluation of the _Monas hieroglyphica_, the angelic conversations or _Libri mysteriorum_, and such varied works as _Propaedeumata aphoristica_, it is not possible to assess Dee's work as a whole.  Sherman seems to think that all the occult works are incidental, irrelevant to who Dee really was.  But he never argues this directly, preferring instead to pick out the flaws in Graham Yewbrey and Peter French.  In the endnotes, he does note that Nicholas Clulee and Deborah Harkness have done excellent work on understanding Dee the occultist, but he gives them little credit despite his own total incomprehension of those works. <br /> <br />Sherman's account is important and should be read by anyone seriously interested in Dee.  But the total project cannot be understood absent Clulee and Harkness.  More recently, Szonyi and Hakansson have added important rereadings, not of course available to Sherman.  If one takes Sherman alone, one has a wrong impression of Dee -- which is precisely what he accuses his predecessors of.  Taken with a grain of salt for all its remarks aboutother scholarship, including especially the totally wrong-headed misunderstandings of hermeneutics and poststructuralism, and in fact taken strictly as the work of a very narrow historian interpreting a few texts, Sherman is essential.  But if you think this book covers the range of Dee, you (like Sherman) are sadly mistaken.  Read Clulee and Harkness, then come back to Sherman.	2004-12-10

He's done his homework on the criminal gangs of the period and all, I don't fault him on that, but the writing is drab and tedious.  Moriarty just isn't an interesting character the way Vito and Michael Corleone are, and the whole Holmes side of the thing is a series of flashbacks that stink.  There's a little jab at the Jack the Ripper stuff, but it just doesn't ever get off the ground. <br /> <br />Guess what?  Moriarty was evil.  Isn't that interesting?  Bet you didn't know that. <br /> <br />Gardner invents a whole new character, the new detective who hunts Moriarty (named Crow), but the guy never comes to life.  Gardner seems to think here that character life happens when you make people talk in old-fashioned slang and put a glossary in the back to make it all authentic.  Ho hum.  The only time anyone ever got away with this was when Crichton wrote \\"The Great Train Robbery,\\" and that was because it was a true story. <br /> <br />Snooze.  If you love Holmes pastiches, go ahead, but otherwise it's nothing to stay up for.	2004-11-17

If you're looking for a simple, straightforward account of the possessions at Loudun, read Huxley's book.  If, on the other hand, you're interested in Michel de Certeau, this is definitely the place to start (as Stephen Greenblatt says in his foreword).<br /><br />De Certeau was one of the greatest historians of his generation, but many of his books are simply inaccessible; The Practice of Everyday Life makes graduate students all over the world weep.  This book is accessible and tells you most of what you really need to know about how de Certeau works.<br /><br />First, look at the way he breaks down a straightforward narrative structure.  He notes that the traditional mode of reporting is aligned with an empirical sense of data, but that in this case, that mode of data-reportage is very much one faction's bailiwick--that of the doctors and the jurists, who are working for the King.  So he recognizes that he can't quite buy that mode, and has to step outside.  This is something Harry Harootunian has talked about too, but de Certeau did it better.<br /><br />Next, examine the way he talks about the layers upon layers of \\"possession,\\" of the colonization or imperialism expressed toward the nuns' bodies and voices, their language and discourse, the whole truth of \\"what really happened.\\"  These things are exactly the problem in the Loudun case, and de Certeau tries to leave them as complex as they were while making them comprehensible.  Some might think this is playing with words and metaphors, but it's not: it's the most elegant take on this kind of approach you'll ever likely see.<br /><br />Finally, look at his intersections of original texts and commentary.  The original was given as texts \\"presented by\\" de Certeau, which gets at the heart of the matter.  He contextualizes all those texts, but not just in the sense of where they happened in history but also where, in the most complex sense, they existed or were produced or had meaning in history.<br /><br />This is de Certeau at his best.  Read this first, and think about everyday life.  Think about spectacle: think about how, as he says, although there was weeping and wailing about the possessions and exorcisms, this didn't prevent the serving of snacks to the visitors.  Put it all together and you have an actual historical moment in its total context.<br /><br />Nobody ever pulls this off like he did.  Read it, think about it, do it, and try again.  Then re-read it.  And do it over.  This is what great history really is, at base, if we are willing to discard outdated preconceptions and dubious assumptions.<br /><br />Not an easy read, but this is the best there is.d meaning in history. <br /> <br />This is de Certeau at his best.

It's a Paul Prudhomme recipe, you see.\\"  The nutritionist now begs for a copy of this recipe.  I should note that I had eaten this dish (and I hate squash) and thought it was delightfully full of fat.  Oops!    Okay, not every recipe in here is spectacular.  But most of them are incredible.  Your pantry will fill with things like apple juice, evaporated skim milk, and the like, but you will eat very well and not look like Paul Prudhomme (I'm sure he'd think this funny, and you know what he looks like).      The baked squash with shrimp is worth the price of admission right there, because you'd think it was seriously bad for you.  You can taste the butter, you see, and the cheese.  Of course, there isn't any, and it's amazingly healthy.  If you ate this every day, you'd probably lose weight, but people would be begging to come eat with you.  The guy's a genius.    Let's face it, if you mastered all these recipes you could open a health-food restaurant and make a mint.  Serve up a lot of hard-core fattening food that just happens to have no fat at all.  And they'd line up.    A couple hints.    You really do need a bunch of non-stick pans.  The insane heat with no fat thing doesn't work so well without non-stick.  Get the best quality you can.  For an extra-special treat, put a tablespoon of olive oil in the bottom instead.  That's the kind of non-fat we're talking about: a tablespoon of olive oil is a big jump.    If you're making the browned flour to produce fat-free roux, go very slow and don't expect really dark colors.  It works, but it's definitely a halfway measure.    Magic Brightening is surprisingly effective.  Don't knock it until you try it.    Remember that this is way pre-Atkins, so it's low fat but not low-carb.  If you're a carb [...], go eat a steak and shut up.  If you're into delicious food with very low fat, buy this book.    About 50% of the recipes here are brilliant, absolute genius.  About 25% are very good indeed.  The rest are a mixed bag, but I must mention that I don't have a dehydrator so the whole \\"turkey jerky\\" thing just passed me by.    So what you do is you buy this and you buy \\"Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen\\" and you alternate.  You have \\"Fork in the Road\\" health food for two days, which is no hardship, then you have something totally evil and decadent from \\"Louisiana Kitchen\\" for a night, and then, feeling guilty but full, you start again on the \\"Fork in the Road\\" health food.    There are other Cajun cookbooks, of course, but what for?  Eat 'em and weep.	2004-11-13

Unfortunately, the quality of testing has slipped, so that not all recipes work just the way he says.  I say this at the start, because in 95% of cases, these recipes are wonderful.    This is definitely not yo' mama's Louisiana cooking.  But Prudhomme adds all this \\"taste as you go\\" information that is fascinating and helpful.  He tells you, you see, what a dish will taste like at each stage.  For example, he remarks that something is going to be very spicy and salty, with an undertone of ginger.  Okay, you taste it at that point, and see what he's saying.  Then you add the chicken (or whatever), and that cuts the flavor and builds it up.    Prudhomme is into flavor layers.  Basically the idea is that you have caramelized stuff, then very cooked stuff, then lightly cooked stuff, then just barely cooked stuff, all going at the same time.  At each layer, the flavors are different, even the spices.  If you can tell the difference between a raw onion and classic (good) French onion soup, you know what I'm talking about.  And this cookbook is a primer in how to build layers of \\"meaning\\" in your cooking by these techniques.    Okay, not every recipe works perfectly, but most of them are excellent as they stand.  The Country Chicken Pie will kick your [...].  The Beef Stew Pirogues are unbelievable.  And some of the desserts are things you'll dream about.  I actually had a guy call me to tell me he was quite literally dreaming about a meal I made for him, primarily from this cookbook.    The other thing is that Prudhomme has gotten better as a teacher.  The more you read and cook with this book, the more you will get how this cuisine works, and be able to construct your own recipes.  I have done this with great success, and I give him total credit for it.  I make things up, people tell me I'm a genius, and I know that really it's Chef Paul who's taught me everything Iknow.    And, yes, as one reviewer noted, your kids will like this stuff too.  Weird but true.  If you want your small children to eat leafy greens, cook them this way and stand well back.    A lot of people object that Paul Prudhomme is too into hot food, and if you hate spicy food you're going to hate this cookbook.  But you can tone things down: just make up the spice mix and use less of it than he says.  But it's very odd.  I love his Lambalaya recipe, which I make with orzo instead of rice, and while you're cooking it the dish is WAY too spicy.  But once it's done and you wait about an hour before serving, since you've got to pick up the kids and get everything ready, the spice layer drops wildly and suddenly the thing balances perfectly.      It's black magic and voodoo, that's what it is.  Must be.	2004-11-13

Very high heat.  Complicated sauces.  Intricate spicing.  Cooking \\"the hell out of\\" some ingredients.<br /><br />These things are antithetical to Chinese, Japanese, French, Italian, and Spanish cooking, from which come almost everything you might think you know about cooking.  The whole concept, in so many cases, is to \\"bring out the true flavor\\" of some ingredient, which prompts all that \\"fresh and perfect\\" stuff about ingredients.  All of which is grand, of course, but a little arch, don't you think?<br /><br />This kind of Cajun country cooking, however, often takes unwanted ingredients, or ones that are a tad old, and makes something spectacular out of them.  Looks like hell, tastes like heaven: it's brown and gooey, but by god you'll get down on your knees and beg to be allowed just a little more!<br /><br />Now if you're an accomplished home cook and you've never cooked this type of cuisine, you're going to find instructions that you will naturally want to ignore.  The Sweet Potato Pecan Pie, for example, has you bake it for something like an hour, at high heat.  So quite naturally, you assume it's a typo or something and you \\"correct\\" it in the cooking.  DO NOT DO THIS.  My wife did this with that pie, and it was very good.  I did exactly what I was told and it was spectacular, just absolutely to die for.<br /><br />Here's some examples.<br /><br />Barbecue shrimp.  Will kill you if you eat it too often, but it's basically shrimp just barely poached perfectly in a spicy butter sauce, and you will beg for more.<br /><br />Sweet Potato Pecan Pie.  My very hard-core Yankee relatives who never eat anything they don't know were faced with this thing one Thanksgiving, and finally my uncle-in-law had a piece just to be polite.  Within 30 minutes the entire pie was gone: word spread, and nothing was left over.<br /><br />Chicken Etouffee.  Heaven on earth.  Chicken cooked the way it would have wanted if it could have known how good it could be after its demise, as Garrison Keillor put it.<br /><br />Chicken-Andouille Gumbo.  Bet you thought gumbo was all about seafood and okra, didn't you?  Nope.  This is amazing.<br /><br />Crawfish Magnifique.  Oh my god.  Will make you worship at the altar.  Unbelievable.  Good with shrimp, but with crawfish it'll make you pound the table in ecstasy.<br /><br />Oyster-Brie Soup.  Huh?  Yup.  Just do what he says, will you please?  Serve this at an elegant dinner and watch people sit up straight, realizing this isn't just messing about but serious eating happening right here.<br /><br />I have now cooked about 90% of the recipes in here, and never once had a miss.  I'm no great chef, but I can follow directions, and Paul Prudhomme never ever steers you wrong.  Just do exactly what he tells you and brace up for some truly fine dining.<br /><br />A hint: if you don't like spicy food, decrease the spice mix total.  That is, make up the spice mix as he directs, and then instead of a tablespoon put in 2 teaspoons.  Don't just decrease the hot stuff; it will not be perfectly balanced.<br /><br />Another hint: if you use stock from a can or box (ugh), decrease the salt in the mixes and reduce the quantities of spice mix accordingly.<br /><br />Yet another hint: read his notes at the start about ingredients and especially about cooking roux.  It matters.  Get a cast-iron pan and a good whisk, too.<br /><br />One last hint: if you're making something with chicken in it, and it's too hot just before you put in the chicken to heat up, don't worry.  The sweetness of the chicken willmake it balance perfectly.<br /><br />The man is a genius!make it balance perfectly.<br /><br />The man is a genius!	2004-11-13

The original text is phenomenally complex, with interwoven puns and jokes and references to make an ordinary translator weep.  Most such translations are stilted, painful to read except as \\"cribs\\" for students. <br /> <br />But this one, well.  Heh. <br /> <br />Okay, consider this: <br /> <br />\\"I've just been visiting a businessman and, according to him, the only way to succeed is to practice the 'triangled technique': try to escape your obligations, annihilate your kindly feelings, and geld yourself of the sense of shame.  Try-an-geld.  You get it? Jolly clever, don't you think?\\" <br /> <br />This is a remark from one of the various intellectual snobs who are dominant characters here.  Now if you can't guess, and I suppose several of the reviewers here can't, there is a complicated pun in the original (my wife teaches Japanese literature and deals with the originals, you see).  But the point is that it's sort of funny, but really it's just a play on words that's a little too labored to be funny.  It's a joke for the sort of intellectual snobs that find this kind of thing amusing.  And that's exactly what comes across with this \\"try-an-geld\\" thing.  Brilliant! <br /> <br />I know a professor who teaches Japanese literature who started working through the original and this translation with his students.  At every turn, they found another deft and elegant in-joke turned into a deft and elegant English variant.  It's not perfect, but this is as close to a perfect translation as you're ever likely to find. <br /> <br />For those of you who know a lot about literature, consider translating Nabokov -- let's say Lolita or Pale Fire -- into Chinese, a totally uninflected language.  Can you say, \\"pain\\"?  Insanely difficult.  Okay, same problem here.  But Ito and Wilson pull it off. <br /> <br />For normal people, let's bear in mind that this book is hysterical, if you're a little worldly-wise and alittle over-educated.  If you know people like the intellectual snobs and elites who populate this book, you're going to love this.  You can quickly get over the fact that it's early 20th C. Japan -- academics are academics, and you will recognize them immediately. <br /> <br />In case you were wondering, Mr. Sneaze's name, in Japanese, is Mr. Sneeze.  Yes, it's a weird name.  No, it's not just a name, it's bizarre. <br /> <br />I'll conclude with one further remark about translation of this beloved, very funny book, which incidentally is also good for cat lovers (the discussion of appropriate sleeping places based on moral and aesthetic principles, culminating in the assessment that on top of the rice cooker is the correct place for morning naps is very funny if you have a cat), taking up the problem of the title. <br /> <br />Wagahai wa neko de aru. <br /> <br />(Literally) I Am A Cat. <br /> <br />But the problem is that \\"wagahai\\" is kind of like the royal \\"we\\" taken to extremes; it's a lordly, infinitely superior way of talking, of saying \\"I\\".  And the \\"de aru\\" form is again ultra-formal, just not the way people ever, ever talk.  \\"Neko\\" is just cat.  So the point is that the whole title is insanely incongruous: how could a cat, of all beings, ever say \\"wagahai\\", much less use the \\"de aru\\" form?  Well, this cat can.  Believe me, he can.  He may have no name, but \\"wagahai\\" he is forever, a lord in his domain, a superior being among cats. <br /> <br />If you think academic humor is EVER funny, you will find this book hysterical.  Absolutely the funniest thing you've ever read.  If you hate all such things, you may not like this.  But it's a pity: this cat is a charmer. <br /> <br />If you own a cat, of course, and he does things like indicate (ever so subtly) that somehow he is a superior being who deigns to live with you but is actually studying you for some kind of philosophical text, then you know this cat.  And if you're an academic with a cat, you'll get it in two chapters, and be hooked for the rest. <br /> <br />A brilliant translation of a wonderful book.  Read it and laugh!	2004-11-13

Ideally, you should get the paperback, but it appears to be out of print. <br /> <br />The volume wastes little time or space on trivia (web pages, business memos, etc.).  The handling of grammar is clear and to the point.  Discussions of reading and note-taking, argumentation, and analysis are useful, if not always inspired.  Coverage of documentation and research writing is as good as such manuals get, which is to say decent without being fully satisfactory.  Much of the pedagogical material interspersed with the rest, particularly about ESL students, cultural backgrounds, writing literature papers, and so forth is very well done. <br /> <br />Unlike every other manual I saw when my program reviewed nearly fifty of these tomes, Lunsford's text is clearly written by someone who understands what students will actually be asked to do in college classes.  She doesn't lard the book with a lot of bad Mickey Mouse assignments.  Those who actually read the text will find that she moves rapidly from basics (grammar, etc.) into elementary academic writing, which is of course exactly what professors will demand of students.  Every other text I read through seems to think that professors want their students to write position papers expressing their opinions! <br /> <br />Lunsford has a charming, clear writing style, and the book is simply and clearly laid out.  Those who only flip through it rapidly may think it insufficiently glitzy, but you buy a manual for its content, not its colors. <br /> <br />If you have to choose one writing textbook, this is far and away the best.  Unfortunately, that just means it's acceptable, not that it's actually particularly good. <br /> <br />One day someone is going to write a manual that's about 500 pages (instead of 1,000), that's simple and clear and to the point, and that costs about $25.  Until that happens, Andrea Lunsford's manual is your best bet for college writing.	2004-08-25

After reading extensively in the anthropological literature of the time, Macfarlane formulates a close reading of documents from Tudor/Stuart England.<br />In essence, Macfarlane argues that accusers usually knew those they accused quite well; they were in fact commonly neighbors.  Under older medieval conceptions of neighborliness, one was supposed to offer elderly women (as the accused very often were) charity and the like.  But in the early modern period, with the difficult economic conditions all over Europe and the rise of new conceptions of privacy, property, and so forth, as well as tremendous population growth, people increasingly did not feel inclined toward such easy charity.  What commonly occurs, then, is that a middle-class landowner turns away a somewhat unpleasant elderly beggar, who then stalks away cursing and muttering; indeed, even if given charity, she may similarly stalk away cursing, perhaps believing the charity stingy, or perhaps angry at a situation which requires her to beg for charity at all.  The landowner now feels guilt: he or she has in some sense violated a traditional trust.  One way to assuage this guilt, however, is to assert that the woman was undeserving of Christian charity, on the grounds that she is a witch.  Thus the accusation of witchcraft could serve to assuage one's own personal sense of guilt.<br />This is an extremely simplistic version of Macfarlane's complex social-historical reading.  More broadly, he goes through huge numbers of documents and establishes that difficulties of social relations seem to underlie the majority of accusations in his chosen period and region.  <br />While Macfarlane's work has been improved upon for both England and for the rest of the witch-hunting Euro-American world, it is nevertheless a seminal work in the social understanding of witchcraft accusations.  The basic problem, you see, is that usually there is no reason to think that the accused witches had actually done anything resembling &quot;witchcraft&quot; -- no, they were not midwives, cunning women, or anything of the kind, as a rule.  So the questions are (1) why were these particular sorts of people singled out, and (2) why did anyone level the accusations in the first place?<br />Macfarlane's book should be on the shelf of anyone serious about studying the history of the witch-hunt phenomenon in Europe.  If you are a witch, you may find nothing of value here, as suggested by a previous reviewer.  If you are interested on an historical level, however, this is a major work.	2004-04-18

In fact, even with the price, it's the best.  Too bad about the price....<br />In essence, the volume is a compendium of classic works on the anthropology of religion, from across the twentieth century.  Everybody's here, jammed in hugger-mugger.  The organization is thematic, and you can certainly argue that the particular themes are weak or that the works chosen don't always fit them, but really it's the sheer breadth of the articles that makes the volume so useful.<br />If you are interested in the anthropology of religion, the table of contents will stun you.  You already have some of these articles xeroxed somewhere -- but where?  You may have made copies for your students, or put them on reserve.  But then you have to do it again, because chances are the reserve desk has lost them, or some stinker student has taken the copies away so only he can study for the exam.<br />If this book cost, let's say, $50, you could simply assign it and save the trouble.

US	52809741	R2JCKY3NLBEZKB	0195076133	326851006	Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice	Books	5	90	96	N	N	Groundbreaking, but no sort of introduction	First of all, a little word of warning:<br />As seems to be generally agreed, Bell's writing style is more than a little dense, and while she in some sense introduces ritual theory, she really assumes you already know a great deal about it.  Consequently, the book is simply not approachable unless you have already read most of the works to which she refers.  If you've been assigned this for an undergrad class, or a beginning grad class, you have been cheated.  Professors, please, don't assign this until people have already read Smith, Levi-Strauss, Durkheim, Frazer, Malinowski, Radcliffe-Brown, Evans-Pritchard, Geertz, Ortner, Bourdieu, de Certeau, Turner, Grimes, and probably Derrida for good measure.  This is a wonderful book if you know all that stuff; it's truly painful if you don't.<br />I first read this when I started grad school, and I hated it.  Couldn't see the point, frankly.  Bell's criticisms of various theories seemed worthwhile, but as she doesn't really propose a new method in the end, what's the point?  So I dropped it happily for a long time.<br />Then I came back to it, almost ten years later, because I found myself delving very deeply into ritual theory, its history, and its future.  Suddenly I saw what Bell is up to, and realized that this thing stands as one of the single most important contributions to the field.<br />Now how can both be true?  Well, here's the short, grossly-simplified version.<br />First, Bell argues that pretty much all current ritual theory tends to cleave along a fault-line: thought/action is the usual form.  That is, people DO ritual, and THINK something else.  She then turns to a deconstructive approach, and demonstrates that this is logically nonfunctional.  She's right, by the way.  Whatever you think of the rest of the book, this argument (about the first quarter of the book) leaves smoking rubble where the vast majority of ritual theory used to be.<br />Next, she picks up the notion of &quot;practice,&quot; as formulated by Sherry Ortner, Michel de Certeau, and Pierre Bourdieu, and argues that ritual is a mode of practice, and thus continuous with other modes of behavior within everyday life.<br />BUT, you see, one of the oddities of ritual is precisely that it usually is understood by the people doing it as NOT continuous.  This, she argues, is one of the defining factors of ritual as a specific mode of practice: the practice of &quot;ritualization&quot; largely depends on the construction of a division between ritual and other behaviors, within the culture in question.<br />Armed with that as a structure, she goes and proposes a new way of looking at ritualization, rather than ritual; that is, she wants to look at the way people ritualize rather than the product of their constructive process.<br />Personally, I suspect that this shift to ritualization drags us right back into action rather than thought, precisely the thing she wanted to get out of, but the way she does this is very, very slick.<br />Now here's the $64,000 question.  Did you understand, or care about, almost any of what I just wrote?  If yes to both, you're going to love this book (or hate it, but enjoy the process).  If no to either or both, don't read this.<br />Once again, would people stop assigning this book to those not prepared to address it intelligently?  It's simply not fair, and you should be using the time on something more useful and approachable.	2004-02-15

It's not an argument book, as such, but rather a brilliant overview of the great Elizabethan magus's intellectual career.<br />In essence, Clulee synthesizes Dee's various works into a cohesive whole, arguing that Dee wasn't a scientist on Mondays, a magus on Tuesdays, and so forth.  Instead, he views the totality of Dee's work as a developing project.<br />Clulee's perspective is unabashedly within the history of science, but not in its old-fashioned positivist sense; he was a student of Allen G. Debus at the University of Chicago, and while he grounds his work solidly in the history of science tradition, he does not dismiss material that doesn't quite accord with modern ideas of science.  This is, in fact, what makes the book so valuable: scholars like Frances Yates (to take a famous and wonderful example) draw fascinating conclusions, but sometimes stray rather far from texts; Clulee never does this, remaining locked to Dee, yet is able to build up a synthetic picture.<br />Good recent works on Dee, such as Harkness's book on the angel-conversations, all lean heavily on Clulee.  His book is not, thus, the &quot;last word,&quot; but it doesn't seem likely that there will be a new survey of Dee to supersede this one.<br />If you're interested in Dee's work from a scholarly perspective, you need to read this.  Without it, you can't make much sense of Harkness, or Hakansson, or whoever.  Pity it's so expensive, though -- I can't imagine why.	2003-11-25

If you are not used to academic prose, you will find this book very difficult; it would also help if you know a certain amount about the reception of the Hermetica in 19th and 20th century historiography, and perhaps a bit about the late Classical era.<br />At the same time, this book has been reprinted for a reason: it's the single most important historical argument about the Hermetica.  For a long time, the Hermetica were understood to be purely Greek, essentially Hellenic misappropriations of pseudo-Egyptian ideas, recast in Neoplatonic style.  What Fowden does is to show that these texts do have an important base within the dying Egyptian traditions of their day.<br />For non-specialists, this may seem like small potatoes.  But it changes everything.  If you have read Frances Yates, for example, she argued that these texts were grotesquely misread by Ficino and the Renaissance tradition, on three counts: (1) they thought the texts were really, really ancient, more or less contemporary with Moses; (2) they thought the texts were Egyptian, not Greek; and (3) they thought the texts were really about magic (and not philosophy).  Now there's no question that the Hermetica are from 1st-2d century Alexandria, but they are _not_ simply Greek; they are, in a sense, Egyptian formulations that draw on the then-influential Greek modes of philosophical thought.  Furthermore, it means that the texts we usually think of as the Hermetic Corpus can and should be correlated with the PGM (the Greek Magical Papyri and their Demotic associates), changing the whole character of the texts by giving them a wildly different literary and ritual context.  In other words, the Renaissance got the dating wrong, but in many respects got the rest more or less right; as a result, Fowden's book not only changes the way we read the Hermetica in their Alexandrian context, but also how we make sense of the Renaissance magical revival (Ficino, Pico, Agrippa, Bruno, etc.).<br />If, having read this review, you think, &quot;Who cares?&quot; then this book is certainly not for you.  If you think, &quot;Wow!  That's fascinating,&quot; then this is essential.  I have seen the odd quibble with small points in Fowden's arguments, but I have not seen any serious attack on the main thrust of the book.  Considering when it was first written, that's extraordinary.<br />But you do need to be comfortable with academic prose.Hermetica in their Alexandrian context, but also how we make sense of the Renaissance magical revival (Ficino, Pico, Agrippa, Bruno, etc.).<br />If, having read this review, you think, &quot;Who cares?&quot; then this book is certainly not for you.

But until you have read The Raw and the Cooked, at the least, you are not really entitled to speak about the study of myth, and certainly not about structural anthropology (or its weaknesses).<br />The whole book-the whole four volumes, actually-is structured according to a complex musical metaphor, and the Overture to The Raw and the Cooked explicates this metaphor in detail.  You'll need to know something about serialism (i.e. Schoenberg) to understand it, but once you do you'll really begin to see what L&eacute;vi-Strauss is up to.  He thinks that myth is not like poetry, and is more like music than ordinary language.  I think his comparison is misguided, based on a misunderstanding of serialism, but it's essential to understand why he correlates myth and music to understand the project.<br />In the main part of the book, he goes on to select a \\"key myth,\\" a somewhat arbitrarily-chosen tale from the Bororo, a people he has studied fairly intensively (and did some fieldwork among).  He then begins a massive project of connecting this myth to other myths from South America, breaking down and analyzing all the little bits and pieces as he goes.  The logic can be hard to follow at times; his little diagrams don't help much, and in fact he seems to see this and ditches them in later volumes.  But if you lose the thread, you can lose track of the whole book.<br />Ultimately, he's going to link up a thousand-odd myths from both Americas, demonstrating how each transforms and adds to other themes, until we get a vast complex of American mythical thought laid out in a mesmerizing sort of crystalline web of relations.<br />In short, L&eacute;vi-Strauss thinks that myths are a way of thinking, using concrete objects, about such problems as self and other, social relations, kinship, cooking, culture and nature, and so forth.  He argues that each myth demonstrates a particular thinking-through of such problems by what amounts to cultures as intellectual entities.  This may seem hard to believe, but if you've read The Savage Mind, this is the bricoleur at work.<br />The big problem, as various people have noted, is that his readings are necessarily somewhat subjective; he could be breaking the myths down incorrectly, splitting up whole units or lumping discrete pieces.  What we really see is L&eacute;vi-Strauss giving it a shot, not a conclusion.  Indeed, he calls this a \\"prolegomenon to a science of mythology,\\" which hits the nail on the head.<br />I doubt very much whether anyone ought to continue the work, correcting the readings on the basis of further fieldwork or computerized analysis, as he seems to want.  Once you've read through this series, you really have to wonder whether it's worth going further, or whether there aren't more interesting questions to ask about mythology.  But his point really does stand: myth cannot be taken as a bunch of moral tales and ritual foundations; it must be recognized as thought enacted, or action thought-through.<br />The big question he doesn't address is history; as in The Savage Mind, he wants to exclude the historical from analysis.  Thus the next big step would be someone like Sahlins, who tries to build an appreciation of the historical into structural analysis.  Nevertheless, these books really do deserve serious study.  If you want to see what mythology really is about \\"in the raw,\\" as it were, you need to read this.  As far as I'm concerned, those who haven't read The Raw and the Cooked have no business saying that structuralism is dead, or that it's unhelpful; they don't know what they're talking about.<br />L&eacute;vi-Strauss is a genius, and if he goes in directions that maybe now seem a bit dated, let's remember when he wrote all this stuff (i.e. the 60s).  Butonly the intellectually lazy can afford to pass over this essential moment in the study of myth and religion; we have to work through, not skip over.can afford to pass over this essential moment in the study of myth and religion; we have to work through, not skip over.	2003-10-31

Tarot was certainly invented in the fourteenth-fifteenth century, in Italy, and was used for a trick-taking game not unlike Hearts, Spades or Bridge (the Trumps were Trumps, you see).<br />2. In the late eighteenth century, Antoine Court de Gebelin re-invented Tarot as an occult device, as part of his vast project of interpreting everything interesting as Egyptian.<br />3. Eliphas Levi picked up on Court de Gebelin (we don't know how directly), and through his influence Tarot (as a divination device and later an initiatory and meditational one) became central to the occult revival and now Neopagan and New Age spiritualities.<br />4. In the nineteenth century, lots of people got interested in Tarot and cartomancy, such that it became a big fad, especially in France.<br />Now, given all that, Dummett would have us go one step further: since Tarot was not invented for occult purposes, and since Tarot was not handed down since Egypt, Atlantis, or what have you, Tarot as an occult device is stupid and everyone who uses it is an idiot.  <br />Dummett is a distinguished scholar of Frege, if memory serves, and has a top chair in logic, with expertise in epistemology and language.  You'd think he wouldn't fall into this elementary logical trap: what makes historical origin (of a word, a practice, an object) necessarily absolutely contiguous with every possible later usage?  For example, \\"occult force\\" was once (until the late 17th C.) a stock term describing things like gravity, and now it's always and only used to mean magical forces and such; does that mean Dummett's book should be retitled to avoid \\"occult\\"? or that Newton was an idiot to call gravity \\"occult\\"?  It boggles the mind that Dummett can turn off his brain this completely, book after book.<br />At any rate, in this particular book, rather than going on from this claim to tell us all about how Tarot was (and is) used for playing a card-game (as in other books by Dummett), he and his pals tell us instead about how various interesting characters of the Belle Epoque developed cartomancy into a fad, a craze, and an occult tradition.<br />Unfortunately, there is no better history of occult Tarot out there, and if you simply discard every editorial or analytical remark, it's not even all that bad.  Of course, that's rather a lot to cut.<br />If you want the history of occult Tarot from about 1790 to about 1900, this is the only place to go.  Just disregard everything except factual statements (and consider carefully whether any given remark is really opinion masquerading as fact), and be ready to look things up in the notes if the authors don't make it clear.<br />Someday somebody will do a Ronald Hutton on Tarot, and things will be better.  Until then, Dummett is as good as it gets.  Too bad he's so miserable.<br />Incidentally, if you want the original texts on Tarot, they've been published, in French (try amazon.fr -- American Amazon doesn't have it):<br />Court de Gebelin, Antoine.  _Le Tarot_.

Unfortunately, he had a tendency, especially in later life, to crank out volumes on every conceivable theme and concept, and many of these later works simply do not work.  But he wrote a small number of great books, works without which you simply cannot claim to have read the \\"classics.\\"  Patterns is one of these great books.<br />The translation is dubious, to the say the least, but even so Eliade comes through.  He always does.  In Patterns, he walks through a kaleidoscope of images and concepts, demonstrating at once his brilliance and his disturbingly broad reading.  He never uses one example where ten will serve, and this becomes part of the whole argumentative structure of the book.<br />The point, you see, is that these \\"patterns\\" he pulls out-out of history, out of context, whatever-appear again and again.  The opening chapter, on \\"Sky Gods,\\" for example, is a little manifesto, a demonstration of everything Eliade is all about.  If you really master this chapter, come to understand every bit of how it works, you will truly understand Eliade.<br />For those who have been introduced to Eliade through The Sacred and the Profane, for example, and are looking for an accessible book, Patterns does have the difficulty of moving rather rapidly through its arguments.  Some discussions simply move too fast for the general reader; Eliade is trying to talk primarily to scholars, and as such he assumes that his readers have some familiarity with his examples.  But unless you plan to challenge his thought deeply, you simply do not need to read all of the background material.<br />One failing of Patterns is simply its publication date: this book is from the fifties.  And a lot has changed since then, particularly our knowledge of lots of other religions.  So sometimes his examples seem simplistic, or downright dubious-and they are!  But youjust can't begin to make sense of Eliade without Patterns.<br />If you liked Joseph Campbell, it's time to step up to the plate.  Read Patterns, maybe reading Cosmos and History and The Sacred and the Profane first, and you'll see the real thing at work.  It's true, he doesn't really address his audience magnetically as Campbell sometimes does, but then his project is primarily to suggest to that reading and studying other people's religions is the only way for moderns.  You see, desacralization has made modern humanity incapable of seeing the truly powerful worldview of homo religiosus (religious humanity).  But unlike Campbell, Eliade doesn't think that we can solve this by getting in touch with our bliss and our myths; he thinks that only reading books can approximate this world.<br />Admittedly, from a scholarly perspective Eliade is a crypto-theologian with a huge axe to grind.  Sure, some of his examples are extremely problematic-a point that Jonathan Z. Smith has made on more than one occasion.  But like Smith, I'd argue that we need to go through, not around: without Eliade, we can never really make sense of how we look at religion now, how everyone looks at it.<br />The point about Patterns is that it's really a great book.  It's wrong-about just about everything, when you get down to it!-but it's one that needs to be read.  These days, lots of folks in and out of the Ivory Tower seem to want to get in touch with spirituality.  But Eliade was talking about this fifty years ago, and his points still have considerable weight.  Why reinvent the wheel?  Go to the source, read Eliade at his best, and feel a revolution overtaking you.	2003-10-24

One tends to balance detail and complexity against efficiency, to narrow one's audience while deepening argumentation.  Thus the truly great books of a particular discipline are often incomprehensible outside it, while the wonderfully accessible books rarely do more than describe what others have done.<br />The Savage Mind is one of a small number of exceptions to this rule.  In a book that requires no prior knowledge of anthropology, L&eacute;vi-Strauss succeeds in leveling a major challenge to his discipline and simultaneously to every reader.  In elegant, graceful prose, he meticulously dissects his objects, formulates his arguments, and stretches the range of theoretical speculation to cover an extraordinary range of material from all over the world-including the modern.<br />In the nearly fifty years since this book first appeared, however, much has changed.  Structuralism, for which The Savage Mind served as something of a manifesto, has collapsed beneath the weight of its own logical formation and the critical assaults of various respondents-not all of them well-informed.  But even that most scathing critic of structuralism, Jacques Derrida, has noted repeatedly that we can never really go back: structuralism is part of our thinking now, and the only way out is through.  To put it simply, if you never read this book, you will never gain the right to criticize structuralism as a method for studying culture.<br />Another thing that has changed is basic education.  L&eacute;vi-Strauss takes it for granted that we all know quite a bit about European literature, music, and art; that we know who the painter Clouet was, and the difference between Mannerism and Impressionism.  He doesn't assume expertise, but a kind of general cultural education no longer usual.  This can make some of his analyses opaque, where they are intended to be illustrative.  Just as you can skim these arguments, which are often problematic anyway, you don't actually need to know much about totemic practices to understand; he summarizes what's important, and so long as you don't intend to challenge through data, you need no background.<br />L&eacute;vi-Strauss's arguments proceed methodically and exceedingly rapidly.  Their weight lies in their logic, not their particulars; that is, it really doesn't matter whether his interpretation of any one myth or ritual is correct, but rather whether the means of going about it makes rigorous sense.  He is not expert on everything, and he often inserts such phrases as, \\"Without presuming to decide this issue....\\"  This is not mere qualification: he distinguishes between illustration of method and rigorous analysis of particular material.  If you want him to analyze material, go read The Raw and the Cooked; if you want to know how he does it, read The Savage Mind.<br />To put this differently, to pick on trivia here is to miss the point.  Perhaps you do name your pets differently than he does.  Perhaps the Murngin creation-myth has a step he forgets to mention.  Perhaps the interpretation of Clouet doesn't really quite make sense if you know much about Clouet.  So what?  These are illustrations, not proofs.  The same happens with the famous essay \\"The Structural Study of Myth\\": L&eacute;vi-Strauss proposes a reading of Oedipus which, though wildly suggestive and interesting, really doesn't make a lot of sense for Oedipus, and leads to a stunningly silly conclusion.  No matter: the point is to demonstrate how the method works.  Again, if you want to see him analyze something, you don't read his pure theory books; you read The Raw and the Cooked, or Totemism, or (especially) The Elementary Structures of Kinship.  So long as you can work out how the method functions, L&eacute;vi-Strauss thinks you should go test it yourself, on material you know.  Then, if it doesn't work, you can come back and criticize.<br />As we read The Savage Mind, we are constantly forced to slow down.  L&eacute;vi-Strauss has a tendency to condense an enormous argument into a paragraph, then move on; unlike his best American and English counterparts, who make their analyses as explicit as possible, L&eacute;vi-Strauss takes the classically French approach of hitting the highlights in the topic and concluding sentences of a paragraph, then putting all the illustrative detail of logic and material into the middle.  This is a matter of style, a choice and not a vice.  So if you really want to understand the book, you actually have to work through his examples very slowly and carefully.  Otherwise one has a tendency to lose the thread and simply become bewildered.<br />Unfortunately, this translation is, as Clifford Geertz and everyone else has noticed, execrable.  Some sentences are not even acceptable English grammar, to say nothing of their failures to render L&eacute;vi-Strauss's beautiful, dense French.  Mercifully, the various translators involved all recognized their failures and refused to sign their names.  Some day, a really good translation will come along, I suppose, but in the meantime at least this one is hyper-literalist-far better than simply wandering off course.  If you read French perfectly, read La pens&eacute;e sauvage; it's genius!<br />The Savage Mind is an endlessly fascinating, stimulating, brilliant book, a true masterpiece of the human sciences.  It happens that L&eacute;vi-Strauss is quite often wrong, but the fact remains that this is a landmark of scholarship and a book everyone seriously interested in culture needs to read.  Durkheim, Weber, Freud, and Marx are all wrong too.  So are Eliade, Geertz, and Turner, for that matter.  Does this mean we shouldn't read them?  To think we can simply jump to the most recent people and skip what came before is to submit to ignorance and laziness.  L&eacute;vi-Strauss is perhaps the last of the great French intellectuals, and his work will stand for a long time as a challenge and a landmark; you must take up his challenge, read him, and thoroughly master his thought.

If you're looking for that, you simply will not find it here -- try my more recent book (shameless plug).  This is not to say that Van der Poel downplays the magic, or distorts Agrippa; rather, he focuses on the large but essentially unknown corpus of Agrippan works which deal with theological, legal, and traditionally philosophical topics.  Another caveat: this book will be tricky, though not impossible, for those who have no Latin.<br />Van der Poel is a Neo-Latin philologist, and this training allows him access to this very difficult corpus.  He builds up a complex, sophisticated picture of Agrippa as an intellectual very much of his time.  By thus situating Agrippa within his intellectual context, Van der Poel is able to provide coherent, effective readings of _De vanitate_ [On the vanity and uncertainty of the arts and sciences] and _De praecellentia_ [On the pre-eminence of the female sex], two rather refractory works.<br />In addition to his precise analyses of Agrippa's Latin, Van der Poel also carefully goes through the entirety of his large correspondence, resolving or at least clarifying a great many long-standing difficulties in Agrippa's bio-bibliography.<br />Perhaps most essentially, however, Van der Poel succeeds in placing Agrippa's work in the context of early sixteenth-century humanism, both at a rhetorical and a philosophical level.  Those interested in these subjects will find a wealth of material here, scrupulously annotated and painstakingly analyzed.  In some respects I suppose some would see this book as plodding, but it is an excellent example of a classic mode of scholarship, much maligned by people who'd rather sound clever than do the kind of hard work Van der Poel does here.<br />If you are serious about understanding Agrippa as an intellectual of the early sixteenth century, you need to read throughthis book, along with Nauert's earlier study (_Agrippa and the Crisis of Renaissance Thought_, 1965).  If your interest is in Agrippa as part of the skeptical and humanist movements, this book is absolutely essential.  If you want the magic, look elsewhere.	2003-10-22

Smith is the enfant terrible of the History of Religions discipline, although he's no longer young.  From his first essays (collected in Map Is Not Territory) to his more recent musings in To Take Place and Drudgery Divine, he has outraged, stimulated, challenged, and restructured the study of religion in the modern academy.<br />Each essay here is a little gem, and should be read and savored by any serious student.<br />Right at the start, in \\"Fences and Neighbors\\", Smith shows his true colors: he talks about the taxonomy of walnuts, and uses this as a startlingly perfect demonstration of the strengths and weaknesses of various ways of defining and categorizing religion, religions, and religious groups.  \\"In Comparison a Magic Dwells\\" points out that most comparison falls into Frazer's homeopathic/contagious magic division, and demonstrates the various pitfalls of the comparative endeavor.  I could go on, right through the devastating and terrifying analysis of the Jonestown White Nights mass suicide, in which Smith argues that to study religion seriously, we have a duty to recognize that it is not always \\"nice,\\" not always about love and peace, and that sometimes awful things are done because of religious feeling, but that nevertheless we are required to try to make sense of it -- a lesson that has renewed force in the wake of 9/11.<br /><br />Smith does have one real flaw, though, which is that he assumes that everyone is as intelligent and careful as he is.  He thinks that every reader will read all the endnotes, for example, and think about their implications for his arguments.  And he assumes that every reader will hang onto a certain common-sense perspective on human nature, and interpret his arguments in that light.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this isn't always the case.  \\"In Comparison a Magic Dwells,\\" for example, argues the need for a radical rethinking of how comparison should be done; many readers, however, think that he is anti-comparison ingeneral.  \\"The Bare Facts of Ritual,\\" which tries to uproot an old sympathetic-magic reading of certain kinds of hunting rituals, and by implication a broader range of apparently intrumental rituals, has been interpreted as a failed attempt at a complete theory of ritual.<br /><br />In short, this whole book needs to be read again and again, notes and all, with extraordinary care.  If you're not willing to put in a great deal of effort, just don't bother--you're going to come out thinking that Smith has nothing constructive to say.<br /><br />In _Imagining Religion_, Smith is by turns devastating and hilarious, and always brilliant.  Not all of it can withstand every possible criticism, but what can?  A seminal work, _Imagining Religion_ marks a place at which the History of Religions must either turn or turn back; the very possibility of the study of religion depends upon our turning.	2003-08-30
US	52809741	R2QTYJOA9IYZFK	0791421783	564265050	Access to Western Esotericism (Suny Series, Western Esoteric Traditions) (Suny Series in Western Esoteric Traditions)	Books	4	65	65	N	N	Important but imperfect	This is certainly Faivre's most useful book for a broad knowledge of esotericism.  It's really not a book, actually, but a series of articles and an annotated bibliography, but it holds together well and is readable just as it is.  The translation is solid--it's the work of Joscelyn Godwin, a student of Faivre's, whose works are also very useful.<br /><br />The nice thing about Faivre is that he takes the subject-matter seriously, which isn't exactly usual, and he goes into some depth about the 18th and 19th century thinkers he's interested in (von Baader, notably).  For an introduction to a somewhat lost period, i.e. Enlightenment occultism, you could hardly do better than Faivre.  He was until recently a professor at the Sorbonne, and has founded a whole little school of scholarship on esotericism (Hanegraaf and Godwin leap to mind).<br /><br />On the down side, Faivre is a weak phenomenologist, and this leads him occasionally into dubious categorical divisions that distort the material.  To put it more simply, the distinctions he makes among esotericism, mysticism, and occultism are problematic, and lead him to cut off from view a lot of interesting figures.  The reason, I think, is that he believes that a certain sort of syncretic esoteric viewpoint is the best hope for a spiritual revival of western humanity, and so he focuses on the thinkers he thinks best support that goal.<br /><br />The very best thing here is his annotated bibliography.  It's not perfect, to be sure, and now a bit dated, but there is nothing like it since Albert Caillet, who's so encyclopedic as to be unhelpful to a beginner (he's also very dated, of course).  If you're serious about learning something about the occult in later European history, you need to read through this bibliography and take Faivre's advice.<br /><br />I don't think this is a book that a serious student should be without.  At the same time, I would advise a little caution with his glib definitional and methodological pronouncements.	2003-08-30

In order to understand Idel's work here, you really need to know your Scholem pretty well; begin with \\"Major Trends\\" and move on from there.<BR>Now once you understand a fair bit about the history of Kabbalah in the Scholem model, you are ready to make sense of Idel's highly constructive critique.  In short, Idel notes that Scholem divides Kabbalah into two major blocks: what he calls the \\"theosophical,\\" i.e. discussions of emanations (sefirot) and related topics, particularly within the tradition of the Sefer Zohar, and the \\"ecstatic\\" or \\"practical,\\" which focuses on various means of achieving mystical unity with the Godhead through revolutions of letters and so forth.  <BR>Now Scholem, you must understand, was working against a conception of Kabbalah as basically nonsense: the antisemites saw it as typical ... stupidity, and the philosemites as essentially fodder for antisemitic tracts and thus something to be suppressed.  So Scholem focused on theosophical Kabbalah because it is quite congenial to an intellectual, philosophical perspective on mysticism.<BR>Idel, however, is working in the next generation after Scholem.  It is no longer necessary to defend Kabbalah: everyone grants that it's an important, legitimate tradition.  So in this book, Idel begins the process of rehabilitating ecstatic Kabbalah, particularly that of Abraham Abulafia (on whom Idel wrote his dissertation).  There's more to it than that, of course, but this is the basis.<BR>The book is elegantly argued, erudite, and deserved the prize it won.  But trust me on this--you really need to know quite a lot to understand what he's on about.  You do not, fortunately, need to know Hebrew or Aramaic.  If you've never read much about Kabbalah and want an introduction, go to Scholem and come back in a while.  If you want to practice Kabbalah, I doubt this will be much use to you.  But if you know some Scholem and are ready to work through a rigorous critique very slowly and carefully, \\"Kabbalah: New Perspectives\\" is hands-down the best there is.	2003-08-30

In essence, Hutton isn't for or against; he's an historian.  This approach may well annoy those looking for support for their beliefs, of course, but for those interested in a dispassionate account, this is the book to buy.<BR><BR>Hutton really starts with the eighteenth century, with Masonry, \\"cunning men\\", and other magic-workers of various kinds.  He discusses these folks as sources for the later witchcraft revival, and gives his sources scrupulously.  He then moves on to the nineteenth-century \\"occult revival\\", which is only rather sketchily handled, and to Gardner and the whole complex from which he arose.<BR><BR>Next, Hutton discusses Gardner in considerable detail, considering the whole \\"Dorothy Clutterbuck\\" problem and the whole complex of the first Wiccan covens.  It seems not unlikely that this discussion will infuriate those who don't want to think of Gardner as a spiritual ancestor for their modern practices.  At the same time, it's likely to tick off those would-be \\"debunkers\\" who want a lurid account of Gardner the evil sex-maniac.  Overall, I found that Gardner came off rather sympathetically, which surprised me.<BR><BR>For me, the best thing about the book is the discussion of the extension of Wicca past Gardner's own influence.  For example, I tend to associate the rise of Neopaganism with liberal politics, given the strong affiliations with the rise of feminism, ecological activism, and a kind of back-to-the-earth approach to collapsing the modern military-industrial dominance of (especially) American economics and politics.  But Hutton demonstrates that in the first half of the century, in England, Wicca was very much a right-wing movement, not entirely divorced from movements like Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts and the Kibbo Kift.  The transition from right to left, concurrent with the switch from one side of the Atlantic to the other, is fascinating, and deftly handled by Hutton.<BR><BR>I suppose the book is somewhat dense, if you're not used to mildly academic prose, but by academic standards it's pretty breezy reading.  The book is quite accessible, as it is carefully indexed and Hutton makes clear what he's doing and why.  If you are interested in a fairly direct, straightforward history of Neopagan witchcraft, this is a great book.<BR><BR>You will hate this book if:<BR>1) You are absolutely certain that Wicca is a surviving ancient pagan religion, continuing underground despite centuries of oppression; or<BR>2) You are absolutely certain that Wicca is a load of nonsense, made up by some foolish sex-crazed women, which offers no spiritual rewards to anyone with half a brain.<BR>You will love this book if:<BR>1) You are willing to read some rather dense, careful historical prose, in a mildly academic style; and<BR>2) You would genuinely like to know a good deal about the ins and outs of the origins of the modern pagan witchcraft revival, and how it has developed over the last century.	2003-08-30

If none of these fit you, you won't probably like the book much; but let's assume you are so interested.<br />Serendipities is a group of five short essays about various oddities of European intellectual history as it relates to ideas about language.  If you have read Eco's The Search for the Perfect Language, this collection is a sort of addendum, unfortunately rather repetitive.  If you haven't, you will probably have little context into which to fit these discussions of Athanasius Kircher's theory of Chinese characters and Egyptian hieroglyphs, Leibniz's binary-mathematical interpretation of the Yi Ching, etc.<br />Assuming, however, that you have that context --- and note that we are now talking about a very narrow audience indeed! --- you will find a number of amusing bits of trivia, but little analytical depth.  One has the sense that Eco is describing some little bits of things he stumbled on, which might be interesting to follow up but which are, for him, tangential or marginal.<br />The most valuable discussion in the book is the first chapter, which considers the problem of a history of folly.  What are we to do when we encounter an extremely influential set of ideas based upon an entirely incorrect premise?  For example, the Donation of Constantine, or the existence of Prester John's Christian Empire of the East, or the existence of the Rosicrucians, etc. --- all of these influential ideas are based upon some massive misrecognition, some completely erroneous interpretation of the authenticity of some text or texts.  So how are we to interpret that historical influence?<br />It is an interesting and important question, closely allied to the problem of a history of magic or the occult.  Unfortunately, Eco does not attempt a methodological solution, but rather places these ideas into their respective historical trajectories and points out how influential and odd are the conclusions drawn.<br />But so what?  If you think it's great fun to expose the confusions of our intellectual ancestors, and have the background to understand specifically linuistic confusions of this sort, you might find this book enjoyable.  For certain it is well written and charming, after all.  But as for any conclusions, well, Eco doesn't draw them.  As such, this is more or less a list of things which would ordinarily be found in footnotes to abstruse scholarly works.  And without a serious and in-depth analysis, they should go back there.<br />If you are a big fan of Eco in all his genres, and thus have read and made sense of a good deal of his serious scholarly work (e.g. his Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language, or The Limits of Interpretation), you will probably want to add this to your collection.  Otherwise this is not the place to start with Eco, and probably not the place to end either.	2001-12-16

If, on the other hand, you are interested in ancient Egypt as it actually was, you will find this book extremely elusive and difficult to grasp.<br />Iversen, an Egyptologist of some note, first wrote this book in 1961, but it has been added to the Bollingen Mythos collection from Princeton, which also publishes people like Jean Seznec, Erwin Panofsky, etc.  I have not compared editions, but so far as I can tell the only difference between this and the original edition is the addition of a brief preface discussing the work of such scholars as Frances Yates.<br />Okay, on to the book itself.  In short, Iversen wants to discuss how European thinkers (before Champollion deciphered hieroglyphics at the start of the 19th C) thought about hieroglyphs, how they misinterpreted them conceptually, and how as a result they constructed a vast and erroneous mythology of what Egypt really was and what wisdom it could impart to the wise seeker.<br />The story is now relatively well-known, largely as a result of this book.  Since Europeans did not realize that hieroglyphs are primarily phonetic, they assumed that their meaning was based entirely upon a connection between the pictures and the objects they represented graphically.  Since it was hard to make sense of any actual inscriptions based upon this theory, European thinkers developed elaborate theories about the allegorical significance of hieroglyphs, such that a picture of a snake eating its tail might allegorically represent the infinity of time and space, and hence the universe.<br />If the story I have just sketched sounds boring to you, don't buy this book.  If, on the other hand, you think this is nifty --- or you already knew this but want the details --- this book is for you.<br />Iversen begins with an introduction to hieroglyphics as they really were, then goes on to a chronological story of reception and attempts at decryption.  Along the way, we pick up a great number of really interesting people and ideas, because Egyptomania was a constant theme in (especially) Renaissance iconography and intellectual history.  We get bits of some famous books and some obscure ones, raving madness and serious scholarly analysis, and everything in between.  <br />One can hardly summarize the varieties of mis-decipherments in Renaissance European Egyptomania, but Iversen manages to cover a huge amount of ground in a relatively few pages.  My only criticism is an unfair one: he doesn't know (or care) about cultural linguistic perceptions, and as such he tends to group all of these would-be decipherments into a kind of history of folly.  Nevertheless, he is willing to take it all relatively seriously, considering that he thinks it's silly.<br />The result is a book which is charming and scholarly at once.  Unfortunately, it is somewhat densely written, probably because English is not Iversen's native tongue.  On the up side, there are a lot of pictures of hieroglyphs and, more interestingly, things described as hieroglyphs which bear little obvious relationship to the ones inscribed in Egypt.  It's a fascinating tour of an important and still somewhat neglected field, and suitable for the general educated reader as well as for the specialist; indeed, the specialist may find it a bit sparse on detailed information, although the notes and apparatus are certainly satisfactory.<br />This book is somewhat dated, of course, but remains the seminal work in this odd corner of intellectual or cultural history.  If you find the description here interesting, you will probably enjoy the book.	2001-12-16

That said, most reviewers have suggested that the book be reviewed by someone fairly up on the field.<br />Assmann calls his project a \\"mnemohistory,\\" meaning by this a history of the way certain aspects of an ancient history are remembered and distorted over time.  The central focus of this mnemohistory, as indicated by the title, is Moses and his Egyptian origins.  Assmann is a distinguished Egyptologist, so he wants to root this mnemohistory in Egypt, not in any of the numerous pseudo- or para-Egyptian texts (the Hermetica, for example, or Plato's various renderings of Egypt).  In short, the question is this: What, if anything, might ancient Egyptian historical events have to do with later Western conceptions of (1) Egypt, (2) Judaism, (3) Moses, and (4) monotheism in general? <BR>    <BR>Assmann begins with a seemingly radical thesis: that the historical figure(s) represented in \\"Moses\\" was an Egyptian priestly exponent of the Akhenaten/Amarna monotheism, which lasted a couple hundred years and ended under the reign of Tutankhamun.  The implication of this is that Judaism, and in particular Mosaic Law, was constructed as a counter-religion to normative (i.e. non-Akhenaten) Egyptian religion.<br />Having demonstrated that this thesis is plausible, Assmann moves on to examine how this peculiar origin of Judeo-Christian ritual and legal prescription was remembered and reinterpreted across the millennia.  He examines Maimonides, John Spencer, and Ralph Cudworth, showing them all recognizing the Judaism-equals-Egypt-backwards connection, but interpreting it variously for philoSemitic, antiSemitic, philoEgyptian, or other purposes.<br />Next, he moves on to examine the flowering and spreading of this debate through the eighteenth century, where it influenced Deist and Masonic discourse, as well as that of major philosophers.  Finally, hemoves to what seems to me the heart of the book, an analysis of Freud's _Moses and Monotheism_, examining the ways in which Freud utilizes psychoanalytic techniques to reveal the same half-remembered ancient trauma beneath the very origins of monotheism --- that is, Freud realizes that the hideous cultural trauma inflicted upon Egyptian culture by the Akhenaten revolution led to suppression, repression, and thus to expression in not only monotheism but also a violent aversion for monotheism's apparent originators.  In short, Freud discovers in the Amarna trauma the repressed origins of anti-Semitism.<br />The book concludes with an Egyptologist's analysis of the monotheism of Amarna, on which this reader is not able to pronounce; that said, Assmann's credentials certainly suggest that this should be a most expert reconstruction.<br />_Moses the Egyptian_ is an extraordinary piece of visionary scholarship, wide-ranging and courageous, but copiously annotated and supported.  If, having read this review, you think this book sounds like the niftiest approach to Foucaultian archaeology, or some similar theoretical structure, this book is probably for you.  If, on the other hand, you want a careful history in the more classic sense of a narrative, with people and events, and some sort of proof of who Moses \\"really was,\\" you're not going to get much out of this.	2001-12-02

Although she wrote on other subjects, her primary legacy is in this field, particularly her books _Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition_ and _The Art of Memory_.  For anyone interested in the occult Renaissance, these books are both absolutely required reading.<br />As a scholar, Yates had some bad habits, and these are most obvious in _The Rosicrucian Enlightenment_ and, to a lesser extent, _The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age_.  In these books, we see her habit of beginning with a &quot;What if?&quot; proposition, then repeating it in stronger and stronger formulations until it has become an accepted fact.<br />_The Occult Philosophy_ has this problem to some degree, but the primary problem is that Yates tries to deal with a subject on which she is not qualified to pronounce: Kabbalah.  As she asmits, she is not a Hebraist, and her only access to Kabbalah comes from reading some of Gershom Scholem's work.  Of course, she cannot be faulted for writing on the subject before Kabbalah became a large and accepted field of study within Jewish Studies, but Yates here displays her usual tendency to overstate her case.<br />A related problem is that she can be rather offhanded in her treatment of figures peripheral to her obsessions (i.e. anyone not John Dee or Giordano Bruno), and this can lead her to distort matters by repeating others' second-hand analyses.<br />Having said all this, bear in mind that it's Frances Yates we're talking about here.  Stacked up against her best books, _The Occult Philosophy_ looks pretty sad; stacked up against almost anything else in the field, it's drop-dead brilliant: it's very well written, charming, stimulating, and extremely accessible.  If you like Yates, read this book now, just take it with a little grain or so of salt; if you haven't experienced Yates yet, DON'T buy this --- read _Giordano Bruno_ NOW!  <br />Yates had her faults, certainly, but she almost singlehandedly invented a field of study.  This is an important part of the Yates corpus, but by no means its core.	2001-11-26

Do an author search for \\"Agrippa occult\\" and start there.<br />Now, assuming that you know who Agrippa (1486-1535) was, and roughly what his Occult Philosophy was, let's talk about this volume.<br />This is a scholarly critical edition.  The copious annotations do not so much explain the text as tell you what Agrippa is quoting or referring to, so you can look up more texts.  The introduction is functional, but not terribly helpful to the nonspecialist.  On the other hand, when I wrote my book on Agrippa, this thing was a constant and trusty companion; boy am I ever glad I shelled out for this!<br />Agrippa's book itself is obscure and difficult, but at the same time it is the seminal attempt to develop a philosophical framework for magic as a practice.  If you just want to read the book, read it in English (buy the Llewellyn edition) unless your Latin is stunningly good.  So if you don't already know the book well, you shouldn't be spending money on this.<br />The editing is meticulous, including constant explications of Agrippa's many references and sources.  There is a wonderful index and bibliography, making the volume exceptionally useful -- Agrippa himself is deliberately confusing and at times seems disorganized.  On top of everything else, the editor has included angle braces and further notes so that we get a complete edition of the Juvenile Draft (1510) woven into the final edition (1531/33).  I can't say enough good things about the edition.<br />Every library with a serious early modern collection should have this.  Brill's books are extremely expensive, of course, but they are permanent.  The paper is acid-free, the binding is very toughly stitched, and so forth.  If you shell out for this text, you will still have it a long time from now.  If you are not in control of a library's budget, though, you'd better try to getyour librarian to order this.<br />In short, this is a volume for a library, a specialist, or a wealthy Latinist.  If you are wealthy enough to afford this and just want a cool edition, bear in mind that you can sometimes find Agrippa's _Opera_ in early 17th C editions for about what this volume costs --- no critical material, of course, but pretty.  If you have good reason to want a critical edition, though, this one is not likely to be superseded.	2001-11-25

Unfortunately, his untimely death prevented him from writing up most of his conclusions about Jewish mysticism, although a great deal is hinted in his _900 Theses_.  There is now a good edition of the _Theses_ (ed. Steve Farmer), but even so it is very difficult to understand what Pico was up to.<br />In this volume, Wirszubski delves into the problem by examining Pico's sources, particularly the translations made for him by the convert Flavius Mithridates.  Wirszubski compares those translations to the original texts Flavius must have used, and shows that the translations were often highly eccentric.  By reading very closely into these sources, then, we are able to determine something of what Pico must have thought Kabbalah was like in its original Jewish form.<br />From this point, we can to some degree extrapolate Pico's Christian synthesis, the starting-point of all later Christian Kabbalah (although see also Reuchlin's works).<br />Wirszubski's work is extremely difficult, and not for the casual reader.  A working knowledge of Latin is essential, and a smattering of Hebrew would help.  Furthermore, the analysis presumes a fascination with the minutiae of source-criticism and considerable expertise in the intellectual history of the Florentine Renaissance.  The analysis is meticulous, the notes extensive.  Wirszubski also demonstrates --- although this is hardly his intention --- why nobody does source criticism on Christian Kabbalists: you have to know everything!<br />Overall, this is an essential work for the specialist, and one that should be in every serious library of early modern occult sciences.  I suspect that the lay reader will find it incomprehensible and boring, and it is inappropriate as an introduction to the subject for any reader.  If you have already read Scholem and Idel on Kabbalah, and Yates, Walker, et al. on early modern occultism, however, this is sort of the next level.  One could wish there were more studies like this, but there are very few people who could write them.

It is constructed in the form of a conversation among three thinkers, the most important being Simon, the Jewish explicator of Kabbalah.  This work is in a sense a sequel to Reuchlin's _De verbo mirifico_ [On the wonder-working word], but focuses almost entirely on the Kabbalistic side of things.<br />As an introduction to Kabbalah in an ordinary sense, the text is not particularly useful, since Reuchlin has his own somewhat idiosyncratic spin on what is most important.  As an introduction to Christian Kabbalah, however, it is a seminal work, and along with _De verbo mirifico_ and Pico's _900 Theses_ required reading.  Reuchlin's opinions probably did more than anything else to encourage the spread of Jewish mystical thought into the Christian West, and this is one of the books at the heart of that movement.<br />The edition is useful, including both an English translation and a facsimile of the Latin text.  Unfortunately the layout is poor, so that the translation often ends up several pages off from the Latin, preventing direct comparison.  The translation itself is good, although it would be improved by more scholarly apparatus and notes, which are conspicuously thin.  Fortunately the volume is inexpensive, which makes up for quite a bit.<br />A decent library of early modern occult thought should have this book.  The modern practitioner will not, I suspect, find it terribly useful, nor will those interested primarily in Jewish mysticism and Kabbalah.  The principal value of the book is that it makes available a text which greatly influenced later Christian occult thinkers, notably Agrippa, Dee, Bruno, Fludd, and others.	2001-11-25

This three-volume compendium of occult texts is by far the best of what is otherwise a bad lot --- there are a lot of terrible bibliographies of occultism out there, but this one is something else again.  Not only does it include nearly every important text, it also has them in multiple editions, so you can figure out what was published when.  Caillet also includes brief biographies of the authors, and these are often very useful introductions to sometimes obscure figures.<br />The set was compiled in 1912, so of course it doesn't include anything recent; the really depressing thing is the prices he gives --- oh for a time machine!<br />If you are compiling a serious library of occultism in any period prior to the 20th century, you need to have this.  It is expensive, of course, but worth it.  Put it on the shelf with Thorndike, and you've got the keystones of a good occult library.<br />The only real problem with this set is that many of the texts are extremely difficult to find.  For some people, the fact that it is in French will also be a problem.	2001-11-25
US	52809741	R24RDL6KVH4DDI	1564591700	221031925	Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy	Books	3	53	63	N	N	A Valuable but Incomplete Edition	This volume is a facsimile of Robert Turner's English translation (1654); the original volume first appeared (in Latin) in Marburg around 1554.  The original volume included a large number of short texts of varying interest, but Turner (for unclear reasons) decided only to translate a few of them.  This edition includes 6 short texts: Of Geomancy (H.C. Agrippa); Of Occult Philosophy the Fourth Book (pseudo-Agrippa); Heptameron or Magical Elements (pseudo-Peter de Abano); Isagoge: An Introductory Discourse on the Nature of ... Spirits... (Georg Pictorius Villinganus); Of Astronomical Geomancy (Gerard of Cremona); and the anonymous Arbatel of Magic.  Only the Geomancy is actually by Agrippa, and it doesn't fit well with the other texts.  The Fourth Book is, as another reviewer noted, certainly spurious; it purports to be Agrippa's &quot;secret key&quot; to the Occult Philosophy, of which he spoke in a letter to a friend.  The Heptameron and the Arbatel are grimoires of some interest for those interested in black magic, as indeed is the Fourth Book itself; the Isagoge is a rather dull dialogue about spirits; and the Astronomical Geomancy is more or less impenetrable but perhaps interesting in a peculiar way.  There have been a number of reprints of this volume, some now surprisingly valuable despite their modernity; all, however, have trimmed out one or more of the already few texts.  As such, this is probably the best edition available.  It is, like all Kessinger products, a cheaply-bound xerox facsimile of the original 17th-century text, but it's readable and includes everything.  If you collect grimoires or magical texts, this is a very famous one, and you ought to have it; copies of the various Latin printings turn up with some regularity, and those with access to Latin would do better with those, although they are of course quite expensive.  If you're looking for works by Agrippa, the Geomancy is all you'll find here, but it's interesting in a number of respects.If you want to know about Agrippa's ceremonial magic, however, you need to read book 3 of the Occult Philosophy, available in a nice Llewellyn edition.	2001-11-04

For a serious biography and critical assessment of Agrippa, see Charles Nauert, _Agrippa and the Crisis of Renaissance Thought_, which is hard to find but worth it.  Morley's book is, however, chatty and enjoyable to read, and includes a number of humorous stories and suppositions about Agrippa's life and work.  Morley's assessment of texts is very dubious indeed, although he can hardly be blamed, as he was after all writing in the mid-19th century.  Occultists will find this book useless; historians may find some material here, but should start with Nauert.  See also Marc van der Poel's book on Agrippa's orations, (...)	2001-10-23
US	52809741	RDECREG9ZPU0B	0553096427	522349519	Love and Sleep	Books	5	16	17	N	N	Misunderstood	The first sequel to AEgypt, Love &amp; Sleep chronicles lovelorn and adrift Pierce Moffett as he stands upon the cusp of a magical change in history.  Simultaneously, we view the brief encounter between Giordano Bruno and John Dee at Mortlake in the late 16th century, Pierce's own childhood in the Cumberland mountains, and begin to see deeply into the lives of Pierce's two roses (Rose Ryder and Rosie Rasmussen).  This book seems to have been unpopular with some Crowley fans, perhaps because it almost entirely lacks any sort of action, and is instead a lyrical, brooding meditation on change and age.  It is also true that some of the Renaissance scenes are over-long, windy, and at times do not quite ring true.  Further, it is a sequel, and what's more will have two more sequels of its own; the third book in the series, Daemonomania, is already out, but who knows when book 4 will appear?  Although I would grant all these criticisms, it is Crowley's graceful prose that makes this book such an extraordinary achievement.  AEgypt was a bit unfocused, seemingly unsure where it was going; Love &amp; Sleep takes wing and soars.  Crowley's ear for modern speech is exceptional, and he also manages to clutch us emotionally without ever dipping into maudlin or pathos.  Furthermore, the way he weaves together oddities of Renaissance magical history and mythology with the modern world is breathtaking --- Bobby Shaftoe's werewolf father is hauntingly real, human, and deeply felt.  For me, this is Crowley's best book since Little, Big, but it's certainly not for the quick reader.  Love &amp; Sleep requires a good deal of effort and time from the reader, and we must be prepared to surrender to the homely, slow pace of the prose.	2001-05-09

The first 2 volumes cover late antiquity through the 13th century, and volumes 3-4 cover the 14-15th century.  These are strong volumes, copiously researched and well-indexed, and a major source for work on the period.  But it is the last 4 volumes that are the heart of the work.  Covering the 16th, and 17th centuries (2 volumes each), these four volumes remain entirely unsurpassed.  Thorndike has chapters on almost everything, from major figures (Agrippa, Cardano, Bruno, etc.) to broad themes (Astrology, pseudo-Aristotelian works, etc.).  Just about everything worth mentioning is at least mentioned here; the index alone is worth the price of admission...Now to whom would this set be useful?  Well, anyone who has a good reason to want to investigate something in the history of magic fairly thoroughly.  The primary difficulties with the book, you see, are (1) it was completed in the early 1950s, so none of the more recent scholarship (e.g. any of Frances Yates's work) is taken into account, and (2) Thorndike was something of a positivist, and so he tends to pass rather summary judgment on the more unabshedly magical of his subjects --- note his hatchet-job on Cornelius Agrippa, a personal favorite of mine.  If, however, you expect to do any scholarly research on some figure or problem in especially 16th-17th century magic, you need to read Thorndike on the subject.  Sure, his judgments may be dated, and his scholarly methods even more so, but you will never find another reference work on magic which packs so much information so densely.  Every library which claims to be a research library needs this boook; for private individuals, nobody can really claim to have much of a \\"magical library\\" (for whatever purpose) unless he or she has shelled out for this set.  Scholars of the subejct who don't know about this ought to be ashamed of themselves.  And any occultists take note: chuck out that dreadful Man, Myth, and Magic set, and buy this instead!s ought to be ashamed of themselves.

US	52809741	R1DJFYRC9B98KW	0875428320	373980728	Three Books of Occult Philosophy (Llewellyn's Sourcebook)	Books	5	17	20	N	N	An excellent edition of a classic	Agrippa was undoubtedly the most important and influential magician of the early 16th century; this work in particular was of major importance to Giordano Bruno, John Dee, etc.  Until this Llewellyn edition, however, the complete English translation of _De occulta philosophia libri tres_ has not been available outside microfilm copies and the odd illegal xerox.  Here Donald Tyson has provided a clean edition, with extensive and useful annotations and even a copious index. Insofar as I have problems with this edition, they stem from translation issues.  Tyson is no Latinist, as he admits, and sometimes he allows the original translator (J.F.) to get away with murder, utterly misrepresenting phrases here and there.  Overall, however, J.F. was an accurate if literal-minded translator. Practitioners will probably find Agrippa obscure and unhelpful; other reviews seem to reflect this.  But Agrippa's work intends to explicate the philosophical underpinnings of magical practice, not to lay out spells and techniques as such.  If you want those things, you'll hate this book; if you want a really sophisticated and ambitious attempt at philosophical justification and formulation of magic as an intellectual endeavor, this is the most important book for your shelf.	2001-04-13

This edition, like just about everything from Kessinger, is essentially a xerox copy bound in thin cardstock. Agrippa's book is the great masterpiece of its kind from the early 16th century; modern practitioners as well as intellectual historians may find it somewhat impenetrable. As an historical resource and compendium of magical material, the work is unparalleled.  I suspect that many modern practitioners will find it annoying that Agrippa gives essentially no practical examples. For the linguistically adept, there is an excellent Latin critical edition from E.J. Brill, edited by V. Perrone Compagni.  If you want to understand the book from a non-practical perspective, my _The Language of Demons and Angels_ is now out.	2001-04-13

Yates argues that magic lay at  the heart of the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century, and  places the extraordinary misfit Giordano Bruno (1548-1600) at the center of  that development.  In later works, Yates often let her insight run wild,  but this book rightly revolutionized thinking about magic and occultism in  the Renaissance.  It will be a difficult read for those not used to  academic writing, but it is extremely clear, and well worth the effort.	1998-10-06
