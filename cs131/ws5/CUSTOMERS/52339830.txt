Rather, it represents an attempt to explore, without succumbing to the two dominant stereotypes of `Islamic fundamentalism' and `multi-ethnic Bosnia', how and why a war that began as a defence of Bosnia ended as a Bosniak struggle for survival...  In his introduction to Hoare's book Brendan Simms, author of the best analysis published thus far of British diplomacy regarding the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, says that he wishes he had been in a position to consult the work when writing his own.  Hoare's approach to Bosnia differs from that of participants in, or witnesses of, the events that he covers; but his advantage lies in the fact that, being neither,  he is not a prisoner of memories.  The idea that the war should end without a victory was certainly not Bosnian, but his book explains the circumstances that led it to be accepted at the very point when the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina was poised to win the war, leading to the surprising conclusion of the war ending in neither victory nor defeat.  His research is important for all those who in their different ways are involved with Bosnia, but it is only a Bosnian translation of the work that will permit a critical reading of it, by counterposing the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina's own image of itself with that reconstructed by the British historian.<br /><br />Gordana Knezevic	2005-03-29

Stewart '26 Series)	Books	5	18	36	N	N	Sets the record straight	During the wars of 1991-95 in the former Yugoslavia the military aggression of Milosevic's Serbia involved also a campaign of historical revisionism. Serbian nationalists falsified Yugoslav history, claiming that during World War II it was only the Serbs who had resisted the Nazis while the Croats, Muslims and Albanians had all been collaborators. In presenting to the world this dishonest picture of events, the Serbian nationalists sought to demonise their fellow Yugoslavs so as to justify their own war of conquest.    Dr Cohen's excellent book sets the record straight. As a Jew who is disgusted by the way Serbian nationalists exploited the history of the Holocaust for their own genocidal purposes, Cohen sets out to expose their historical revisionism and does so convincingly. He proves on the one hand that Serbian nationalists collaborated extensively with the Nazis; wartime Serbia's quisling leader Milan Nedic was one of Hitler's most loyal allies while the Chetniks of Draza Mihailovic joined with the Axis forces in attacking the Partisans and even handed over Jews to the Nazis. On the other hand, Cohen demonstrates the massive participation of Croats, Slovenes and other Yugoslavs in the Partisan resistance.    It would be wrong to conclude from this book that the Serbs as a people are somehow inherently pro-Nazi or prone to violence and aggression. The Serbs, like the Croats and Muslims, had their share of fascists and war-criminals; but like the Croats and Muslims they also had their share of anti-fascists and resisters. The xenophobic propaganda of Milosevic and his supporters in the West has done much to obscure the history of extensive COOPERATION between Serbs, Croats and Muslims that took place during World War II. In countering this propaganda, Cohen has helped to restore a more balanced picture of events.	2002-12-27

Curiously, the text was produced in November 1995: anyone can get  predictions wrong in advance of the event, but it requires a special talent  to make false predictions about events that have already happened.	2000-03-13

Specific chapters  are devoted to concentration camps, siege warfare, rape, incitement to mass  murder, and guilt, and the whole work constitutes a powerful argument in  favour of the Tribunals, concluding that: `for the first time in human  history, those committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, or the  ultimate crime, genocide, would have to reckon seriously with the  possibility that they would be brought before the international bar to face  truth, be held accountable, and serve justice.'	2000-03-13
