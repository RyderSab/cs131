However, I found her to be a very dislikable person.  She put friends and family through pure h@ll, yet wouldn't dream of being locked up in a psych ward.   <br />Once I got to the Epilogue however, I lost all respect.  She seems to be suggesting that only she had the awful struggle with depression and there are just too many people on Prozac now.  As if the rest of the people on prozac don't \\"deserve\\" it as much as she does.   <br />If she were my child, she would have been admitted to a psych hospital in her late teens and a lot of her misery (and the misery she put other's through) could have been avoided.	2005-04-05

I mean shouldn't I be since our prisons are full of them.  But, like Michael Moore, I can honestly say that every single injustice or bad thing that has happened to me has been at the hands of a white person.<BR>It was a white person who ran a stop sign and turned my life into a living hell.  I will never recover from that accident.  It was a white boss, who thought that I should sleep with him to keep my job.  It was a White guy who cheated on me.  No, correct that, it was a bunch of white men who cheated on me (in separate incidents of course).  We don't see serial killers who are African americans, no they are all white.  We don't see African American kids going into schools and blowing their classmates away, we don't see black CEO's stealing the company profits while filing bankruptcy.  I had never realized that African Americans have NEVER done anything to me but \\"whitey\\" has screwed me over time and time again.  <BR>I loved the whole book, but this chapter really opened my eyes.  It's like Oprah says \\"a lightbulb went on\\".  <br />I also loved his chapter on the stealing of the White House by our Thief in Chief. \\"W\\" has done more damage to this country in 3 short years than any single human being.

However, this book stood out so much above the rest I've read lately that I just had to share.  The book is about a polio survivor, the 50's, the discovery of the vaccine and oh so much more.  It's about living the life you were handed, not the want you thought you were going to get.<br />His epilogue is pure poetry.  An example:  \\"Life continues to change.  New things surface; old wounds hidden by bigger wounds show up when the bigger wounds are healed; new clusters of misgivings and confusion take shape to replace old clusters of exhausted adjustments.  New things come along to be accepted with grace and peace.  The disability and its challenges continue to evolve, and one must achieve acceptance and grace and peace again and again, day after day.\\"<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone.  I read about 5 books a week and this book is in my top 20 of all time.	2003-07-10

Are memories a drug, since they can be both painful and pleasurable?  What would be like if our memory bank suddenly lost its filter?  Unfortunately, this well written book doesn't answer the questions.  Anne Ursu is a wonderful writer, her phrasing is absolutely beautiful and her use of metaphors is superb. She writes \\"Your mind is a lot like your closet.  Your try to hang up your clothes well and line up your shoes like little soldiers and keep your toys from tipping over, but sometimes you just can't keep it all organized\\".   Sadly though, the story is lacking desperately in plot.  I am on page 205 of this 277 page book and I keep waiting for the story to begin.  Normally I would just toss this type of a book in the garbage but the writing is so good, I'm going to finish.	2003-01-27

I am not adopted, have not adopted nor am I a birth mother.  I'm simply someone who likes to read non fiction.  I also had some interest in reading this as one of my best friends adopted a baby 19 years ago and that child has reunited with her birthmother recently with seemingly little problems for all involved.  I also had worked in a psychiatric hospital in the 80's and found that a disproportionate number of juveniles on the wards were adopted and I've always wondered why exactly that was.<br />This book answered some questions about that and opened my eyes to other things as well.  By the end of the book, I was questioning who really benefits from adoption besides the adoptive parents.  While I hate to see the \\"explosion\\" of teens having kids these days, I don't know anymore if it's always such a bad thing that they are keeping their kids.  I've always felt that life must start out an uphill battle for adoptees knowing that they were rejected by their natural parents (often in all good intentions.)  I also found it interesting that when she went to meetings with adoptees  she saw that they had no idea how much pain the birth parents went through and continued to go through. <br />I liked Margaret's writing style, I like that she did not expose her son.  I'm glad things turned out like they did for her.  What a terrible decision she was faced with in 1965.  (keep in mind, this was before Roe vs. Wade).	2003-01-20

How sad that someone had raised him for 16 years and then &quot;lost&quot; him.  This is a story about one man's dignity.  Unlike a lot of stories involving institutions, it seems as though John encountered an awful lot of caring people employed at these places.  I find it interesting that although he learned to communicate with others, he never discussed his past or gave any real clues as to his beginnings.  <br />It's a well written book about a sad subject.  I recommend it.	2003-01-13

I couldn't find a single book in my collection that I had not read or didn't seem a bit &quot;imposing&quot; in my current state.  I went up to my son's room (he's 18 not 6) and found this book on his shelf.  What a godsend.  A book that can make you giggle out loud in between the moans of the flu is a wonderful book.  I needed to read something that didn't require me to constantly think about the plot or which character was who and this was perfect.  I had my boston terriers in bed with me (as always) and they would periodically come out from under the covers to check why I was cracking up one minute and hanging over the bucket the next. <br />Get this book, put it aside for when you have the flu.  It's a lifesaver and better than any medicine.  I was also amazed by how much I actually learned reading this.  Thank you Bill Bryson.  And Katz too.	2002-12-22

The storyline bounces back and forth between the present and the past and at times that is very unnerving.  However, I found myself very engrossed by this story.  <br />This is a story about post natal psychosis and the resemblance to the Andrea Yates story is downright eerie.  At times the book disgusted me, much like Andrea Yates.  Another similarity between the two stories was that while they may have disgusted you, it was tough to turn off the TV when the Texas murders were on just as it is tough to put this book down once you began.	2002-12-20

I have found comfort and have often pulled my head out of my &quot;you know where&quot; due to this book more so than I have found in many years of therapy.  I suffer from depression at times and while I'm sure there is a physical reason I'm prone to depression, I'm even more sure that my outlook on life contributes to it more than any other single factor.  The teachings of Buddha are to me, more a philosophy rather than a religion.  Life is DIFFICULT.  For EVERYONE.  Accept it and learn not to cling to things, people and dreams.  A mind free of wants will be a peaceful mind.   <BR>If you are interested in learning about buddhism as a means of learning to survive happily in this world, this is the book for you.  It is light, easy to understand and makes a lot of sense.	2002-11-22

The best non fiction always reads like fiction and Lucky does that and does it well.  Alice's description of the rape and aftermath are so well done you feel as though you were there in Syracuse at the time.  However, the book does have a MAJOR fault.  The ending.  I couldn't believe when I got to the ending and there was a short chapter on her heroin use following college with no real warning this was coming.  You are reading along and in the entire book I don't think any substance beyond alcohol is mentioned (as least as far as Alice's intake is concerned).  Suddenly, there in the last chapter she's discussing smoking heroin and living the life of a vagabond.  She just doesn't segue into this very well.  There's no real description of how she began, how she stopped, etc.  I felt like I was reading a different book by a different author.  Considering how much of her family she exposed, her mother's \\"flaps\\" (anxiety attacks-the poor woman was clearly under-medicated or improperly medicated), her parent's indifferent style of loving not only each other but their children; she seems to clam up about this side of herself.   It seems impossible to think that she's intentionally clamming up after vividly and explicitly describing everything else that's happened to her.  It's as though she doesn't think her substance abuse problem was connected to the fallout from the rape.  This being stated,  Alice Seebold is one author that I eagerly anticipate reading any and everything she writes.	2002-11-14

And finish this one I did even though I skipped a lot of paragraphs regarding the adoption of the russian child.  The author, who quite frankly, is not real likable uses her pug Clara (who is of course, the most interesting dog on the planet according to Margot and supposedly EVERYONE Clara encounters) to sell a book that is ultimately about adopting a Russian baby.  So if you are interested in reading a book that has a pug in it but is ultimately about adopting a baby from a foreign country this is your book.	2002-04-16

First, the author was faced with the same dilemma I'm faced with: what kind of job can I do that incorporates my talents with my love for dogs.  Second, since Gracie was deaf I learned a lot about deafness in dogs.  Dan does not carry on about Gracie's deafness and in fact, it does not sound as though it was as much of a challenge as I thought it might be. I have given great consideration to taking in a deaf dog but was afraid to try.  After reading this book I won't be.   I suspect only true dog lovers would \\"get\\" this book.  It would make a terrific gift for your dog loving friends.	2002-04-03

Each one of her books is so different from the other and yet so compelling.  I have read everything she has written and Strange Fits of Passion is one of the finest.  What intrigues me most about Ms. Shreve's writing is how she manages to avoid the \\"formula\\" style of writing that many authors adopt these days. Her books are anything but predictable.

This is a really moving book with profound insights.  I've read two of his books now and each one has left a quote on my refrigerator.  This book put \\"Whatever it takes to break your heart and wake you up is grace\\". Wow! I read that and had to put the book down.  What an interesting way to look at heartbreak and despair.

The book is non judgmental, the author doesn't claim to know whether depression is a nature vs. nuture problem.  He simply say's this is what it is, this is how depressed people think, and this is how you need to change that thinking.   I personally love to read memoirs of people who have battled depression such as Undercurrents, and The Beast, as opposed to &quot;how to&quot; books about depression.  However, this book stands out among the books out there claiming to be &quot;self-help&quot;.  If you are suffering with depression and want some help this is a great book to start with.	2002-01-11

More important was the subtitle &quot;what if mr. right turns out to have four legs and a tail?&quot; I can honestly say it's the only book cover I've ever ripped off a book and framed for my wall.

This one takes a much more serious tone and the topic is quite serious compared to `Watermelon' or `Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married'.   It took a while for this book to grab my interest.  However, it is in the end, a very, very enjoyable and educational read.  Ms. Keyes either did some serious research about the subject of addiction or has some first hand knowledge of the subject. Rachel is portrayed in a realistic manner as are the people surrounding her.

It is both educating and exciting to read.  I really loved this book and truly had no real interest in the subject of sexual reassignment.  However, I had seen the story on one of the tv news magazine shows and thought it might be interesting.  I am shocked that a supposedly intelligent person, Dr. Money, would have ever suggested to the family that changing the gender of the boy who suffered a botched circumcision was the favorable solution.  It's unthinkable that it took years for this story to come to light. I hope that David understands the selfless act he did in allowing this book to be written. The pain that EVERY member in this family must have endured is tragic.   I can only hope that in future cases that doctors will allow the child to come of age to make the choice themself.  David is a MAN to be admired.	2001-06-22

This is a GREAT work of fiction.  The events that unfold are both tragic and believable.  Andres Dubus is a master at creating characters that are both lovable and unlovable. The characters in this book are drawn together by an unlikely but plausible event and the disintegration of these lives is heartbreaking.  He also writes beautifully of the San Francisco Bay area, making you feel that you are there.  This is one of the best books I have read this year.  It's not often I find a work of fiction that I can't wait to pick up again and see what happens next.  So much of the fiction written today is utterly predictable.  I loved this book.	2001-06-06

Claudia is neither.  There are a million and one Claudia and William's in this world.  They just don't seem to have ANY redeeming qualities.  I've known too many Claudia's in this world to get a kick out of reading about one. I also didn't find the book funny in the slightest.

This book, Alice K.'s guide is her weakest book.  Which isn't a terrible criticism as her weakest book is better than most writer's best books!  I found the use of initial's throughout the book annoying as h*ll.  I'm not sure what the point to that was beyond annoying the reader.

This is so much more insightful than most of the single white female, where is the man who's going to rescue me from my life while my mother drives me crazy books that are out there these days.  I laughed out loud when I read things like &quot;I can't believe I'm dating a guy who plays video games&quot; or &quot;parents are the trampoline of life that you spring from again and again until you are comfortable in the air&quot;.  What single 30 something woman hasn't dated a guy who plays video games and wondered &quot;what am I doing with him?&quot;.  I guess if the book is about anything it's probably about someone looking for the easy way out in life while knowing deep inside that until she takes the hard road, nothing's going to change.  Shanny tries every trick in the book to avoid deal with the hard road.  I anxiously await more books from Shannon.	2001-04-17

No, but it's one heck of a fast read and hard to put down.  As a rule, I'm not crazy about the short story category but I found this one addicting.  I found myself wishing I could meet some of the characters.	2001-03-06

I found it incredible that anyone would let a dog loose on the streets to &quot;follow&quot; it around and that she watched one of her dogs get raped.  Her words not mine. I also noted that she mentioned problems with her neighbors due to the dogs.  I am a dog lover and found some of this hard to swallow.  I detest irresponsible dog ownership. She seemed to be so single focused on studying the dogs that common sense went out the window in the interest of &quot;science&quot; and one could argue there isn't much science involved in her methods.	2001-02-09
US	52589742	R1FR4TVLA4SOP7	0312202296	397556684	At Home in the World: A Memoir	Books	5	8	12	N	N	VERY GOOD READ	First, let me start by saying that I came into possession of this book blind. I had not heard anything about it or read any reviews.  I picked it up because I appreciated the comments made by authors that I respect on the back cover.  Another thing I should mention is that I am not familiar with JD Salinger's work and couldn't care less who he is.  I  have tried in the past to read Catcher in the Rye and couldn't stand it.  So....I feel unbiased as far as the subject matter.  To people who say she shouldn't disclose what went on between her and Salinger I say baloney.  The man is nearly a child molester. What kind of man in his fifties starts a correspondence with an 18 year old girl who more importantly looks twelve.  If you are embarrassed by having your life revealed than be darn careful about getting involved with a journalist.  He knew what she was when he contact her and started the relationship.  One would need to be an idiot to contact a journalist if they are so intent on &quot;protecting their privacy&quot;.  Ok, enough on that. This is a very good read.  It holds your interest and flows like a novel.  Joyce is a good story teller and I'm looking forward to reading more of her work.  (I only wish she hadn't undergone cosmetic surgery as it was the only time in the book I questioned her credibility.)	2001-01-09

A few years ago I read Caroline's book &quot;drinking a love story&quot; and found it hit very close to home and that we had many, many things in common.  After spending 10 years sober and divorced, I decided it was time to commit to a dog.  I THOUGHT I was getting just a dog.  No, not me, extremist that I am.  I got a 15 pound bundle of love and joy that I can barely leave to go to work.  I am so happy to read that other people have shared this insanity.  I have found myself like the author reduced to eliminating activities that don't include the dog.   Caroline gives me hope that this situation will abait.  The book is extremely well written, funny and thoughtful.  I don't necessarily agree with some of the other reviewers that people who aren't crazy about their dogs will appreciate it.  I suspect that many of those people who say &quot;come on, it's just a dog&quot; would never get this book.  &quot;A pack of two&quot; is right up there on the list of books for dog lovers along with &quot;dogs never lie about love&quot;.	2000-12-26

Too bad I read this book as I'm no longer a fan.  The book is very readable, but as one reads it one becomes covinced that this woman truly is living in la-la land.  She writes that when her last relationship broke up her ex sold a story (fictional)  to the tabloids about a sexual escapade involving other women and her and how she had to hide her children from the checkout stands from this story.  But, she doesn't mind disclosing to the world that a three way with her and two gentlemen was a fine way to pass an evening.  The irony here is that she claims to be a gay rights activist.  It seems there was not a man in her life that she didn't cheat on.  I'm not a prude but the way she has run ramshackle through her life without much thought to other people's feelings is really, really distasteful.  And of course, she's still doing that by writing this book.  Trust me, you would not want your mom to reveal this history if she had actually been stupid enough to live it.	2000-12-07

This however, cannot be described as a religious book, if anything it is a book about one woman's struggles for SPIRITUALITY.  Anne happened to find her spirituality in Christianity and yet, acknowledges that not every one does.  There's a great quote in the book that reads something like this &quot;religion is for people who are afraid of hell and spirituality is for people who have been through hell&quot;.   Anne covers so many aspects of human nature in this book with grace, humor, honesty and forgiveness.  I absolutely loved her chapter on her mother. She is also very forthright on her struggle with alcoholism and addiction.  I would buy this book for many people on my shopping list this Christmas (well, maybe not my republicans friends)	2000-12-05

I bought this book when I saw that it had won such a prestigious award and I have to wonder what were it's competitors?  Bird goes to the dentist???  I tried and tried to read this book as nothing is more annoying than spending hard earned money on a bad book.  I kept wondering throughout the read, what am I missing.  Hello, where's the story here??? Save your money, assume the committee who handed out the award was asleep at the wheel and spend your money on a book with a PLOT.	2000-11-28

The book reflects on the fact that dogs truly &quot;live in the moment&quot;.  They don't worry about yesterday or tomorrow and are so grateful for the smallest things.  Which, I believe is the secret to human happiness only we don't seem to GET it.  Also, I had never really considered it before, but the inter-species bond we have with our dogs is unique to this planet.  Sure, lots of people love their cats or horses, but do either of them go for rides in the car with their owners, go on vacation with the family or dance with joy when the owner comes home from work?	2000-11-28

Like the other reviewer I found it to be an interesting slice of African -American history.  I found the characters to be believable and sympathetic.  However, I also found that the story really didn't have much of a plot.  It doesn't really lead anywhere and yet it does hold the interest of the reader.  If this is your first Oprah book, don't give up.  Her other choices such as Here on Earth, Back Roads, &amp; A Map of the World are excellent.	2000-10-27

Does that mean it's not effective? NO.  As I was reading this book the quote &quot;what would you be doing if you were not afraid&quot; hit me like a ton of bricks.  Think about it, how would you be living and loving if you were fearless?  Probably not the way you are living now, right? My only complaint about the book is that it somewhat indicated that workers in the work force need to be more flexible. True, but my experience with corporate America has always been that upper management in America needs to be more flexible and not so content to say &quot;but, we've always done it this way&quot; when asked why are we doing something that doesn't make sense or is not cost effective.  The book is worth reading whether you are having problems keeping up with the changes in your workplace or home.  It would make a great gift for anyone.	2000-10-05

I really enjoyed her style of writing.  I found it easy to read.  Her characters at time were a bit shallow in that like another reviewer I  didn't feel she delved into why the characters behaved the way they did  which in some cases was awful.  Her way of presenting life through the  different view points of characters was right on the money.	2000-06-19

This is an important book for anyone who is suffering the fallout of a fairy tale beginning of a relationship.  I recently found myself engaged after only 4 months of dating (and I am someone that ALL my friends call  overly-cautious where men are concerned).  He was everything I ever wanted  in a man....or so I thought.  Things were great until a ring was purchased.   All of a sudden, nothing I wanted or needed in life mattered to this man,  nothing I did was right and I began to feel like I had no business  breathing.  It was like being hit by a bus head on.  I walked around  shell-shocked for days..pleading with him to please talk to me....what  happened?  Thank goodness for this book.  I started reading this book with  the hope that things would work out between us but by the end I no longer  WANTED things to 'work out' with this man.  When I read the line  &quot;would you let a friend treat you like this?&quot;  I thought....NO  WAY.  If a friend did to me what he's done, that person would be written  off my list.  I do think that one should not read this book and believe  that all the commitment problems are his. NOTHING happens in our lives by  accident.   If you are in a world of hurt because of a relationship THIS IS  THE BOOK TO READ!	2000-03-22

There is not a truly likable character in this book.  Everyone is screwing around with people for no good reason I  can see or else is completely self-centered.  I had a hard time believing  that the one affair could ever happen, I mean after all, if you're going to  screw up a long term, happy marriage shouldn't you at least be ATTRACTED to  the person you have the affair with? also I did not care for the variety of  narrators.  This book in no way is on a par with &quot;house of curl&quot;.

While there is a lot of humor, quirkiness and tragedy in this book- it is very believable.  After all, isn't that what all our lives have in common?  The  characters are people you would like to have living next door to you.  I  prefer to read non-fiction books, but this is one fiction book that held my  interest. If ever a book should be described as a &quot;summer beach  read&quot; this is that book.	2000-02-02

I picked up this book based on other reader reviews and the fact  that that Time magazine named it the Best Nonfiction book of the year. The  title of this book, as mentioned by other reviewers, is somewhat misleading  as the book is only in part about Muhammad Ali.  This book is more of a  history about the era in which Ali became the champ.  It is a well written  account of Ali's association with the Black Muslim's and Malcolm X. It is  also an informative account of the other famous fighters of his time and  before.  While the book is not a &quot;gripping&quot; book it certainly  holds the interest of the reader. Surprisingly, after reading it I found  myself less of a fan of Ali's than before,which may be the best evidence  that the book is an honest account of the era.	2000-01-19

Silicon Valley has turned wall street on it's ear and this book gets the humor, irony and just plain craziness down-pat.  Lewis picked the perfect  subject to profile in Clark and portrays him objectively, in my opinion.   The book is a quick read, and holds the interest of the reader.  If you're  looking for a light hearted look at the insanity in the valley this is your  book.  If you're looking for a book about the nuts and bolts of silicon  valley this is not the book for you.	2000-01-02
