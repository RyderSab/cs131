I cannot say too much without giving away everything, but I wanted there to be a pay off at the end of the book and there isn't.  It kind of felt like a waste of time for me as much as it was a waste of time for Andrea as well.  This is set to be a movie in the future staring Anne Hathaway (famous for her role as Mia in the Princess Diaries).  It should be interesting to see if the movie gets better reviews than the book did.  All-in-all the book wasn't bad, it just didn't really go anywhere.  Even at the end of the book it seemed that the author herself couldn't decide if she still wanted to be a part of that life (since this is supposed to be sem-autobiographical) or if she too truly believed it was a waste of her time too.	2005-08-22

Other readers seem to have enjoyed this book a little more than I did.  The other SCU/Bishop novels kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish - particularly the book directly preceeding this book which is called Hunting Fear.  Hunting Fear kept me up at night willing myself to learn as much as I could before falling asleep.  This novel was interesting, but, at least to me, lacked the impending urgency of some of her others.  I believe it is shorter than some of her other novels.  Also, in the other books we are given a clue and then race to the next clue to save lives - there are frightening occurances throughout.  In chill of fear, Hooper wastes a bit of time while we hear a character convince another she is psychic.  It takes up time, and gets a little tiresome.  If the book was longer it would have been okay, but I felt like I got through a third of the book without being sucked in.<br /><br />The sense of urgency wasn't there as much for the reader. Usually Hooper's books have a climax towards the middle of the book and then the grand finale.  In this book, the grand finale almost seemed to be where the book was finally picking up momentum.  Another issue with this book is it wasn't really a question of \\"who could it be?\\" because it is pretty clearly lined up for us earlier in the book.<br /><br />It was an interesting idea, but it seems to me that the book as cut and pasted at the last minute because some part of the story didn't pan out and had to be removed completely. The interwoven characters are great, obviously well thought out!<br /><br />I agree that the flashbacks at the begining of these books are somewhat confusing (as another reviewer mentioned being confused by Miranda).  Obviously many fans are confused by the flashbacks, as she explains it on her website due to reader response.  This is a great series, and I am happy I didn't miss out on this installment - the characters were great, but it isn't up to par.s were great, but it isn't up to par.	2005-08-22

I am sure most people will think this review unhelpful because I seem to be in the minority, but I just couldn't get into it.  Just hear me out...I am glad most people liked it.  For some reason this book seemed to make it sound like it should justify why smart people would want to go to a public university. And also, for a series of books that has always dealt with real issues and growing up...suddenly each family has no issues being able to pay for their daughter to go to a top private university (Lena's parents just don't agree with her choice) and most girls go to college with great boyfriends. I am usually not so picky, but it just wrapped up really neatly (and quickly) for a series of books that has been so realistic.<br /><br />Lena is trying to get into art school.  Her parents aren't too thrilled with her decision and refuse to support her.  She will have to grow up quickly and decide if doing what is best for herself is the best thing to do.  I think I was least interested in her story of all the girls.  The other stories seemed to move more quickly.  We all knew how this scenario would end.<br /><br />Tibby is on her way to NYC film school.  In this book she comes to terms with her relationship with Brian while trying to decide if film school is the right place for her.  She isn't as central to this book as I felt she was to the others...but the author tries to fix that in the end.<br /><br />Carmen is one character who always seems to grow in these books.  I like her! She is dealing wither her mother's new marriage and the changes that come with that.  She is also watching over Valia, Lena's unhappy grandmother.  Her story is cute.<br /><br />Bridget's story is the most interesting in this book, but I cannot say I am all that happy about how it ended.  A few of my friends had major issues with guys in high school...and went to certain extremes to keep them or be with them. I am just concerned about the message this sends to young girls (lol and this is so not usually something I think about).  I don't want to say more and ruin the story.<br /><br />This is a nice ending to the series...and I think the characters are true through the end.  I wish the third book had been more about the girls relationships with each other, rather than with a significant other.  I enjoyed the questioning of colleges and majors and leaving home...that seemed very realistic.essage this sends to young girls (lol and this is so not usually something I think about).

Having no living parents, Chloe's brothers have taken on the roll as protector and she doesn't like it one bit.  Chloe soon finds out that life at Chistlebury might be a bigger adventure than the London Season.  One night she discovers (the presumed dead) Dominic Breckland hiding in her lingerie.  They soon discover that their families are linked through a villian who has scarred them both in the past.  Chloe and Dominic join forces to bring the villian's deeds to the attention of the public- and fall in love in the process.<br /><br />Jillian Hunter's character development is great in this book and I loved it even more than \\"The Seduction of an English Scoundrel.\\"  I don't believe this book had any slow points and had some good mystery without sacraficing romance.  Chloe is strong without being unbelievable for the time period.  The book also has some depth to it as well.  I cannot wait for the final installment of the series!	2005-07-29

After being left at the altar, Lady Jane Welsham seems shocked, but less concerned than those around her.  She sees this scandal as an opportunity to find true love and is ready to embrace a freedom she has never experienced.  That is until the groom's cousin steps in to mend the \\"wounds\\" his cousin has inflicted.  Grayson Boscastle, Marquess of Sedgecroft, is a notorious rogue, but is willing to court Jane in an attempt to boost her sullied reputation.  Grayson assures her family and himself that he is doing this for Jane, but maybe he is trying to convince everyone a little too much???<br /><br />I didn't like this book as much as its sequel \\"The Love Affair of an English Lord.\\"  While the characters were well developed and there was chemistry, I thought the book lost momentum 2/3 of the way through.  Grayson learns a secret about Jane and decides to teach her a lesson....I thought it took away from their relationship.  Nice read though and I cannot wait for Heath's story.	2005-07-29

However, I still find her one of the most enjoyable authors in romance at this time.  The dialogue is always witty.  I can honestly say that she is one of the few authors that makes me laugh out loud.  It does seem that the first four installments of this series were the most lighthearted of the bunch. I enjoy re-reading them on cold winter weekends.  Her books are a little longer than they used to be and somewhat more serious.  I love reading about the family in future novels and learning more about past couples through these more recent books.<br /><br />Despite the fact that I love the older books more, I think Quinn is worth a read.  For me Sir Phillip was my least favorite and I still enjoyed that and am glad I bought it.<br /><br />For those of you looking to start a new series the \\"Bridgerton novels\\" go in the following order<br /><br />#1) The Duke and I<br /><br />#2) The Viscount Who Loved Me<br /><br />#3) An Offer from a Gentleman<br /><br />#4) Romancing Mr. Bridgerton<br /><br />#5) To Sir Phillip, With Love<br /><br />#6) When He Was Wicked<br /><br />#7) It's In His Kiss	2005-07-11

While I would certainly like more...I have to keep in mind that these are short stories. I am usually not a huge anthology fan beacuse I always want more! I would have loved full length stories for all of these characters, but was happy to have their stories told at all.  I bought this book because I read everything Julia Quinn.  At a friend's insistance I began reading Lisa Kleypas and shortly after became a fan.  More recently someone bought me a Kinley MacGregor novel and I can finally review this novel because somehow I coincidentally have now read all the series that lead up to these short stories.<br /><br />Julia Quinn - having always felt left out with not knowing the fate of poor Ned I thought this a fitting end to the \\"Blydon\\" novels \\"Splendid\\" \\"Dancing in the Moonlight\\" and \\"Minx\\".<br /><br />Lisa Kleypas - Dr. Jake has always appeared in Kleypas novels to tend to those in need (which is quite frequently in the Bow Street Runners series).  He was always a bit more developed than some other side-characters and I believe this was a fitting short story.<br /><br />Kinley MacGregor - Every member of the Brotherhood refuse to get married and settle down (but each seems to change their mind one-by-one).  This is a prequel to \\"Dark Champion\\" and \\"Return of the Warrior.\\"<br /><br />Like I said, anthologies are usually not my thing, but this idea of tell a short story about someone the author had skipped over is great!	2005-07-05

Most of the complaints I see in regards to this book are that it doesn't live up to some of Kinley MacGregor's other works.  Having only began reading her novels recently (this is my second), I don't have the same perspective.  I thought this book was very well done.  I enjoyed meeting more of the Brotherhood and am looking forward to the rest of the series.  I usually stick to regency historicals, but Kinley MacGregor is quickly changing my mind.  Those of you looking to find a new author - look no further than Kinley MacGregor.  The short story in \\"Where is My Hero\\" is the official first in this series, followed by this book and then \\"Return of the Warrior.\\"  I enjoyed them all!	2005-07-05

The story of Mary Boleyn and her affair with King Henry VIII and her sister's subsequent marriage to him is one of the most intriguing book I have read in years.  Despite its length it was a quick read and a page turner.  I had owned the book for many months before picking it up to read because I have been so busy that I was afraid that it was so long that it would take a long time to read it (after all my subway commute is only 20 minutes so I cannot fit too much in) but it really went amazingly quickly and I found myself reading it every spare minute I had. I liked the way it was divided by seasons and the attention to detail of where the court of England was at a particular time.  This book gave me more insight as a social commentary than any other book I have read.  Women are pawns politically, religiously and socially.  This is a must read for anyone interested in the period.	2005-06-12

I have had very mixed feelings regarding her more recent works.  I enjoyed the Paid Companion and sicee this wasn't part of the recent series, I picked it up, but I wasn't holding my breath.  I loved this book. The begining was a littls slow going.  But as the main characters got to know each other I really enjoyed the connection. I found myself smiling in the middle of it. I really liked that the mystery aspect was not overly obvious (although I was reading it as a romance novel, not a mystery, so I wasn't really trying to solve the mystery).  I also liked that the mystery climaxed at the very end of the novel.  My biggest complaint is that two of the characters are named Julia and Julian.  Granted, these characters are never together and it isn't too confusing, but of all the names in the world to come up with it seems strange that they would do this.  The psychic aspect of the novel was interesting.  I loved learning the history of our hero and his unusual family.  I loved Quick introduced us to some shady characters just to throw us off the real villian's trail.  Good read.  I am probably givig it such a high rating because I am pleasantly surprised after some of Quick's other, recent books.  Some of my favorites from her past writing include \\"renvezvous\\" and \\"seduction.\\"	2005-04-22

I loved the added story of Emily (our Her's sister) and being able to see the story from her point of view as well.

I will cut straight to my opinion.  MacKenzie is a great writer! She is funny and her characters are whitty. She takes time to develop the characters I think.  The only thing that disappointed me a little was our hero's total lack of fear of his cousin in the begining of the book.  When there is a direct threat to Sarah James reacts, but he didn't seem to worried about them being shot at the first time.  All in all this is a great debut.  It definately had the feeling of an older romance novel which suits me just fine!  I would love to read a second installment with Lizzie, James' sister, and her story!  I think we can all guess who she goes after, but I want to see if she gets him or if she meets Mr. Perfect along the way!  It is a great author who can make me eagier for the next novel!

My friend lent this book to me telling me that I \\"have to read this\\" and that it was something she \\"kept around to re-read on occasion.\\"  I wasn't all that impressed with the first 40 pages.  I had to start it over a few times.  Finally after the 5th time she called to ask how I liked it I just sat down determined to read the whole thing.  After page 50 or so I found myself unable to put it down!  The sensuality of this novel was really well done.  The characters were interesting and human.<br /><br />The suspense of the novel itself isn't all that exciting or surprising.  But the best part of the suspense is that the book reaches a climax during the last 25 or so pages.  This might seem strage but it sure beats the climax happening 75 pages from the end, in which case I usually just find myself skimming the final pages to see who did it.  I enjoyed the book thoroughally.  It seems like Linda Howard is hit or miss (this is my first novel by her) but this one is a hit in my book! I will be buying this one for myself to re-read later!	2005-02-13

She agrees to pose as his fiance to get his family off his back and help him find his friend's killer.  The interesting twists in this novel include: the immediate sensuality (I feel like more and more often we are waiting until page 200 for more than a kiss), Diana's artistic talent seems more thought out than other characters I have read in the past who mearly like to paint, and his interesting ties with the Guardians (a secret group of men who work together for the good of humanity).

I also, in general, do not like books where everything is explained to the reader through a long speech made by one of the characters to a group of other characaters.  This may seem petty but we had the little bit of mystery explained to us over more than 10 pages.  It would have been nice to have it come out a little more over time.<br /><br />I did like the characters and they were developed well.  Ian was cute and Caleb was truely one of the best leading males I have read in quite a while!

It was different than the usual regency novel.  The little bit of suspense did not overpower the romance - as so many do.  I enjoyed learning more and more about Christine, the Earl's dead sister, at the begining of very chapter.  I had to stop myself from reading ahead to find out what happened to her.  In the end, the truth was a little silly, but as I said above, more detail where that was concerned might have over-powered the romance aspect of this book.

The first chapter just grabs you, and, for anyone who rides horses, is an amazing depiction of the relationship between horse and rider.

It drives me crazy in books when parents realize what they should do but are too busy or tired to do it. The first person perspective was great and I loved the horse details.

I thought that the entire begining of the novel was a little slow and then there was little time to wrap up so the end was a little rushed and forced.  It took me a week to read this book and I usually read them in a day or two.  I just kind of had to force myself to continue.  There were very few characters involved with the actual novel.  More specifucally - I was glad that their relationship took time to develop, but it just seemed like it was stagnent for much of the book.  Part of that is because I knew this was a romance novel and we had to get from poverty to educated to wife material, so when it took most of the novel for that first step to occur I had lost interest.  It was all just too neat and tidy for me.  I understand that this is the first in James' new series that involves this family, but they talked about Sebastian's sister Juliana throughout much of the novel and we barely hear a sentance from her in the book.  I get that she was being introducted to us for the future, but I had expected more.  I felt like I spent a great portion of the novel waiting for the necklace to mean something and waiting for James to introduce another character of any kind.  So when the only person who is a secondary character enters the picture and it was she who reckognized the necklace it was just too much for me.<br /><br />I am interested to hear Justin's sotry, however.  I liked his character.	2004-11-13

I think that helped me put it somewhat in perspective.  It took a little longer to get going because we had to meet all the wallflowers and set up their agreement to find each other a husband.  Knowing that, I really liked the story.  Reading about Annabelle's obsession with marrying a peer, mixed with her dislike of Simon (when there was really nothing wrong with him) did get a trifle tedious at times.  But, as always, I love Lisa Kleypas' style of writing and eagerly await the rest in this series.  The relationship between them was well developed in my opinion.  Now that the scene is set with the walflowers' relationship and intentions, I think the rest should be even better.	2004-11-07

Having read wuch wonderful reviews on here I thought I would pick it up.  It is a nice novel...I did like the main characters very much and it was unique.  In general I tend to like novels with more dialogue than this, but Candace Camp writes so well and I barely noticed!<br /><br />My one real issue with the novel is that there is much more suspense, in my opinion, than romance.  The following may be a spoiler for some but in a novel that is just over 400 pages, the actual \\"encounter\\" did not occur until after page 375.  Like I said, it was a good read, but nothing out of the ordinary.  I do think I will read some of her previous works beacuse it appears that authors usually move towards suspense from romance, so some earlier works are probably a little bit mroe romantic.  Authors I like are Gaelen Foley, Lisa Kleypas, Judith McNaught and Iris Johansen.	2004-11-06

I have to say I am sooo impressed with my first encounter with Julie Anne Long as a writer.  This book is special.  It had caught my attention on the bookshelf a few times, but I have a \\"to-be-read\\" pile a mile high, so I resisted.  Then, after seeing all the reviews here I just knew I had to pick it up.  I read it in one morning because I simply had to keep going.  I loved the characters and felt I really got to know them.  They are truely dynamic and just - special.

This is one of those novels where at the end of the book you really feel like you KNOW all the characters inside and out.  I knew from the begining what the outcome of the book would be but I loved every minute of getting there!  Henry and Clare are vivid, three-dimensional characters.  I even liked how well we seemed to get to know the side characters in the book (even those we saw so little of such as Henry's mom).  Brilliant story! The author pulled off a plot that had was so complex that the reader could have gotten lost or fed-up with the time travel aspect - there were so many opportunities to go wrong yet, in my opinion, it all went so well.  She kept us on track.  At times I felt that the book was long but it was amazing to learn so much about characters.<br />I really loved this book which is saying quite a lot since I didn't really like Clare!  I think it is personal - I think that she and I are just so fundamentally different that I couldn't really relate to anything she did throughout the whole book.  But she was a great character.<br />Truely unique book!  Well worth the read - especially for those of us who long for good character development and uinque stories!	2004-07-15

I got this book from the library because of the good reviews here.  I couldn't get into it at all.  I am not one to point out historical inaccuracies and I don't care too much about that whole aspect so nothing like that really bothered me.  Pippa did seem a little vocally advanced for her tender years but whatever.<br />I didn't get into the romance as much as everyone else here seemed to.  I didn't really like the characters.  I have the whole set in this series out from the library so I will prabably finish it, but if I thing don't click for me by the end of the series I don't think I will read much more from James?	2004-07-02

After getting into the book a bit I was shocked at how much I disliked it.  I returned to amazon write this review to see that a few people share my opinion - good because I didn't know how I was going to be the lone negative reviewer!  At times this book is rediculas.  I literally had to force myself to finish it.  &quot;How to Marry a Marquis&quot; by Julia Quinn used a similar situation where a woman used a &quot;rule book&quot; to woo a man, but Quinn is such a fantastic author that it worked.  Lisa Kleypas writes of lawless Lily and even though you cannot think that it would work in Regency England propriety-wise - the love story is too good to be ruined by such things.  Not so much passion here!!<br />Firstly, this plot has been done just too many times in romance that it is rediculas for a debut author to be using it.  Some more experienced authors have pulled it off because they add a lot to the characters or have a real ability to make the reader &quot;feel&quot; the romance-but Caskie cannot pull it off.  Maybe with a little more experience she might be great.  I have a few friends who think that romance is the same old story over and over again with cookie cutter characters.  Unfortunately this book feeds right into that misconception<br /><br />Secondly,  it is very lop sided where propriety is concerned.  They talk about inpropriety in certain aspects of things and totally neglect it in more logical areas. The heroine, Eliza, walks around handing our cards to young men that say &quot;thank you for not calling&quot; to keep them away.  I  didn't get the humor in it at all really.  I am not one to judge a book about inpropriety when they do not bring it up so often.  Magnus says that Eliza going to Italy to paint will ruin her sister's chances of marriage?  Her behavior will ruin their reputation!  And it's not funny at all to me.  How can her Aunts let Magnus spend the night but not let hervisit him unescorted?  And Eliza sneezed on a member of the royal family?  I don't think this is funny and it is too rediculas to imagine.  It starts rediculas and it doesn't get better!<br /><br />Thirdly,  how many people is Eliza going to let push her around?  Her aunts are totally unbelievable (locking the couple in a room together?!?!) and they just meddle in her life the entire book. SUpposedly they &quot;mean well&quot; but locking ELiza in a room with Magnus for the night is not romantic in the slightest.  As if her unfortunate, and poorly written, &quot;aunties&quot; weren't enough Eliza's sister, Grace gets involved!<br /><br />Lastly, unless there is a great GREAT, timeless romance (like, in my opinion, in &quot;Whitney my Love&quot; by McNaught)this back and forth relationship doesn't work!  They like each other - but they won't admit it - and there is no passion.  200 pages into the book they are still just arguing along -  which makes sense since they are so one dimensional characters - but the book is quite wordy without really saying anything.  I didn't feel any relationship budding so if there is no anticipation I don't cannot sit around and read words for tons of pages waiting.<br />I just want people to know that I have never, ever written a review like this before.  You can see my other reviews - in fact I was starting to think that I liked everything I read!  :)  As for a debut author this book lacks, in my opinion, any real unique qualities.  She might be a great author - but this book isn't worth your time.  But, just as I believe Julia Quinn's Splendid isn't one of her best works, I would love to see how this author turns out.  A little experience goes a long way.  If her next book on amazon does well I might be tempted to try again.  I wanted to like the book and I am glad others do!ght but not let hervisit him unescorted?  And Eliza sneezed on a member of the royal family?

I know the purpose was to make him a typical, sullen teenager, but sometime I just didn't want to read it anymore.  I was frustrated with him because he didn't even trust Dumbledore. My only other complaint was that besides the BIG things that happen - there were characters that I expected to have some evil intentions who just turned out to be nasty people.  Sometimes when it seemed like there should be a great scheme there was not.<br />In general the book was great.  I think it is great how Rowlings is writing them growing up.

The only reason I rate the 3rd and 2nd books higher is that we already know the characters by then so the story comes along faster and easier because we don't have to explain so many things.

I didn't like her last set of novels featuring Tobias and Lavinia but was pleased to see that this was out of that series so I gave &quot;The Paid Companion&quot; a shot.<br />Now, this book was better than &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; or the rest of the aforementioned series, but it didn't have the sparkle of Quick's earier novels (those characterized by one word titles).  I always did feel like her books always (as the quintessential idea of romance novels) were where the lovely virgin meets the &quot;rakish roque&quot; and he wants to ravish her so he marries her.  Quick's trademark has always been that one of them is flawed in some way (a scar or a limp or glasses, etc). Later some figure from one of their past comes back to haunt them (usually from her past) and someone is obliged to come in and save the day (sometimes she even saved herself).  In this book I can tell that Quick stayed with the typical formula but tried to add more mystery.  Her female characters are getting more and more assertive which is a plus.  I still, somehow, like the old books better.  This sems strange because they were somewhat cookie-cutter, but I still really liked them and re-read them occasionally when I am waiting for her to come out with a new novel.<br />I cannot put my finger on what exactly abotu this book is lesser than some others, but it is better than her more recent efforts and I did read it in one day - and did enjoy it. It just didn't have the sparkle or chemistry of some of my Quick favorites such as Seduction, Reckless, and Rendezvous.  If you really like mystery with your romance you will probably like this book.  A warning to romance readers - the romance comes late.  If you are a Quick fan you will like this book I think!	2004-06-13

But they were all really cute!  &quot;Lady Whistledown Strikes Back&quot; has recently come out and features the same authors.

This is my first Medieros novel, and I think that I will try another one considering the other reviews that I have read here.  I hope this is not a good sample of her work!<br />The story had a good premise, I just don't think it was executed at all well.  The secondary characters were not at all interesting.  I wasn't all that surprised by who the actually murderer was in the novel so that wasn't too high of a climax.  And then when they come to take Garrick away he and Rowena just explain who the real murderer was and everyone believes them so they all go home???  I think even in Medievil times some proof would be required.  But then again, that wouldn't have bothered me too much at all if the rest of the bok had been good.<br />Rowena lets people walk all over her all the time.  Her father can gamble her away and cheat on her mother for years and all is forgiven?  Garrick can treat her like a dog and she can forgive him?  In other instances this has happened and been more convincinb, but in the way it was handled it just didn't work for me at all.  Johanna Lindsay has some much better Medieval romances if that is your pleasure! So far, I like the romances by Julia Quinn, and Judith McNaught much more!	2004-05-02

While all the Bridgerton novels are a series, they can be read in any order...they stand alone well...but the first few are my favorites!<br />The first time I read this book it was no my favorite of this series.  But, I picked it up again later and I really really liked it more!  It is a Cinderella story and the first time I read it I just kept saying to myself &quot;Whe doesn't she just TELL him?&quot; and &quot;How can he not tell it is her?&quot;  The second time it just seemed to flow better for me!  Sophie and Benedict have a unique version of the Cinderella story when he meets her on a balcony where she is disguised and spends the next few years not giving his heart to anyone else in hopes of finding her.  When Sophie's evil stepmother and evil stepsisters kick her out of her own house she has no place to go.  She runs across a sick Benedict again, and nurses him back to health, only to avoid telling him that they have met before.

She wrote this in her early 20's and while the story is excellent, he execution is not as polished as her other novels.

US	51153827	R2UJZXETOLKHLU	0671032976	869998580	Whitney, My Love	Books	5	2	2	N	N	My all-time favorite	There aren't too many books that I read over and over again and enjoy more and more ever time!  Whitney is McNaught's best book, in my opinion.  The book is long enough to let the reader get into the characters without making us read page and after page of details which could have been left out.<br />I know that some people have issues with Whitney's relatioship with Clayton and how he treats her. But these people just have major communication issues!  From the time Whitney was a girl she had set her sights on marrying Paul.  When she comes back from France a transformed young lady his head does turn her way, but before they are able to marry Whitney is told that she has been sold to the handsom and mysterious Clayton Westland...later revealed to be the Duke Clayton Westmorland.  Whitney resists the match until she realizes that she loves him.  By this point so much has happened between them that she has to win him back!  But the story continues with the woes of marriage when these two high spirited characters butt heads once again...and again!  Despite the fact that you just want to make them sit down and talk through everything from the begining, I still wait with anticipation every time I read it to see if they will end up together.<br />I love all the secondary characters as well.  Clayton's mother and brother are hystarical and her aunt is great!<br />This is a book not to be missed!  And readers should also check out the prequel to this novel, Kingdom of Dreams, which is almost as good as this book (in fact many like it better).	2003-11-14

While I really do think that most of McNaught's books disserve 5 stars, this one is amongst her best.  I don't like it quite as much as &quot;Whitney my Love&quot; or &quot;kingdom of Dreams&quot; for the simple fact that there are certain parts of it that I skip when I re-read it.<br />Elizabeth Cameron was ruined by the advances made by Ian Thornton.  A few years later, orphaned and alone, and by an accident of fate, Elizabeth is thrust into his hands again, this time by the design of an uncle who wants to pawn her off to whoever will take her.  Elizabeth swallows her pride and goes to meet Ian, only to learn that her invitation was an oversight.<br />Ian and Elizabeth immediatly feel the attraction that pulled them together so many years before but pride and misunderstanding keep them apart.  Only when Ian learns the truth about what Elizabeth has been through as a result of his advances does he dare to overcome his own pride and do what he needs to do to heal old wounds and marry the woman of his dreams!<br />But the story isn't over here.  More miscommunications (a trend with ms. McNaught) drives them desperately apart and it takes Elizabeth discovering the desperate results of her actions to come back to him in time to save the day...and maybe just in time to bring them back together again...forever.<br />The characters were great, as usual.  The only thing about this book I don't like is that I always skip the parts where she goes to meet the other prospective husbands when I re-read the novel.  Still a great read!!	2003-11-14
US	51153827	RP1H8ZO6MT1BZ	0671737619	535195561	A Kingdom of Dreams (The Westmoreland Dynasty Saga)	Books	5	1	5	N	N	one of McNaught's best	This book is the prequel to Whitney My Love.  They are both excellent novels!  This is the story of Brenna and Royce.  Kingdom of Dreams is set in generations before Whitney and tells the tale of a war hardened man whose heart softens when he meets his match in a small young lady (and i mean young) named Brenna.  Brenna, who has long saught the love of her father and his people, finds her kingdom of dreams amongst Royce and his people.  In the end, she has to defy her father to prove to her husband that she is his afterall.<br />This is a great novel with wonderful characters and irresistible charm!	2003-11-14

Kate is not searching for a husband at all...she is mostly around to keep Anthony away from her sister Edwina.  Soon Kate finds herself in love and betrothed to a man who thinks himself incapable of love...it is up to Kate to change his mind and convince him that love lasts forever!	2003-11-14

The only reason that I don't give this book 5 stars is because of the period where Jordan is gone and Alexandra has to face British society and the reality of the nature of her husband...I was bored during this part and never have read it again...I skip it when I re-read the novel and it is a significant portion of the book.<br />Alexandra is a great heroine.  She is a strong woman with a belief that the world is a wonderful place: dirt smells nice and people are all noble and good.  After saving a man's life in the woods she is thought to be compromised and forced to marry Jordan.<br />Jordan is actually a great hero.  He is a rogue in the begining of the novel, forced to marry a young girl that he feels nothing for, he won't admit he is attracted to her!<br />Jordan goes missing for a time in this novel and Alex is forced to face the reality that the man she married is not perfect.  All the time he is gone, Jordan pines for his perfectly innocent wife...by the time he makes it back safely to her arms will they be to different to fall in love? read the book to find out!<br />As I said above, the part where Jordan is gone kind of ruins this book for me.  This is amongst the shortest of McNaught's novels and they are separated for a while.  On the other hand, this separation made this novel more unique than many other McNaught novels (which usually dirve the characters apart using mis-communication).  This book is a refreshing change to average romance novels!  McNaught is a born story teller!  The end, which I would never give away, is great and always makes me cry and laugh!!	2003-11-14

Prophecy is the secod novel in the series after Rhapsody and before Destiny and Requium of the Sun.  There are some more novels and a short story coming for this series as well.<br />I love the characters of Rhapsody, Achmed, Grunther and Ashe.  Jo sometimes gets on my nerves, but the book is just great!  It continues the story of The Three as they further their knowledge in the fight against evil.  We see them grow closer and change and I just loved the book and the history that Haydon sets here.  She has created a whole world and I haven't found any flaws yet (which seems a big accomplishment with novels lately).  BUT you have to read Rhapsody first!!!	2003-11-06

It clears up some issues and leaves some others unresolved.  The only way it disappointed me was that I thought it was over!  This is a great series for people newly interested in Fantasy...there is a lot of lore, a little magic, some romance and a lot of plot.  I will be first in line for the rest of the books in this series!  Check them out!	2003-11-06

Yes, I am a female and yes I read romance novels, but I really like a great variety of novels! But I wanted that to be said because I have read several reviews that say this might appeal to silly females who read romances and don't want a real story!<br />Yes, Rhapsody is perfect, and it's not like this didn't annoy me sometimes.  You just want her to get things done sometimes instead of always doing what's right, but who doesn't know a few people like that?  I loved all the characters and how they were all interwoven and all the history in the novel.  I thought it was well thought out and developed.  I don't understand how people can say it's not because it takes three books to get the whole story and I didn't want it to end (and am glad they made a fourth).<br /><br />I admit that each book in this set has about 100 pages in the middle that can cometimes get tedious, but I am always glad I got through them and at the end it all comes together wonderfully!  I think it was these pages that really got me into the characters and how much they care about each other to bring on such alligience.  Achmed, Grunthor, Rhapsody and Ashe are all great characters and it takes a while to develop them all and their subcharacters properly (3 books in fact)! I think the ties to Gwydion and Melisande and Stephen are wonderful!<br />I have passed this book on to three others (yes all females) who have thanked me profusely and bought the entire set.  However, I admit that none of us were die hard fantasy/sci fi readers!  Many of them, however, have taken up sci fi/fantasy after reading these though!  I loved the book at it is at least worth giving a shot, because it seems you either relate or you don't...you either love it, or you don't!  Decide for yourself!  :)lf!  :)	2003-11-05

There was nothing really wrong with the book I guess, I just love the Sound of Music and feel this was a little ripped.  The ending sequence when the kids go to find her and get her back was pretty trite! This was my first Christina Dodd book, and it was going to be my last, but some of her other books got rave reviews on amazon so i gave her a second change and wasn't sorry!  I suggest people check out one of her other books first to get a taste of what she is capable of!	2003-10-19

This is my second Dodd book, and unlike some other reviewers, I didn't have a problem with the male characters in this book.  I thought their actions were pretty consistent with how people could behave after someone called of their engagement or hurt their friend.  The plot was more intersting than the other Dodd book I read, My favorite Bride, (I don't like her stealing the sound of music story personally).  Scandelous again was origional and I liked all the female characters and am eager to hear her cousin's story in a future Christina Dodd book!<br />I have two problems with this book...and I almost gave I would have given the book 4 stars if it had been just one or the other!  There is an editorial problem near the end of the book where it is stated that he is bareback on a horse two or three times and then he &quot;slips from the saddle.&quot;  I am not one to look for flaws in a book, but it was obvious and made me kinda read back a little because I was wondering if I had made the bareback thing up, but it was right there!  They messed up and someone should have caught it!  It may seem petty, but it's in the middle of the hero-to-the-rescue scene and I stopped dead in my tracks to read back to check, wondering what else i must have missed.<br />The other problem I had was that the end was totally thrown together.  The book didn't really drag anywere, and I don't think that anything could have been left out, but that end needed to be expanded.  Nothing rash happens for most of the book and then suddenly there is a great danger and a whirlwind last 30 pages to the finish (which is left open for the sequel).  So I kind of felt like i was just cruising along in a fairly slowly moving book and then bam bam bam...the end.  It's kind of disappointing to have things just explained to you by a character so the book can be wrapped up and this is how this ending felt to me.  It seemed like the author needed to get to the end quickly and just jumped there.  Too bad, for I really did enjoy the characters!!!!<br />I will read the next book though to hear her cousin's story and some other books by Dodd though.really did enjoy the characters!!!!<br />I will read the next book though to hear her cousin's story and some other books by Dodd though.	2003-10-19
US	51153827	R14FHVCJ228QKN	0553290320	502404049	Storm Winds (Wind Dancer)	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Probably my favorite book ever!!	One reason that this book is so great is that it is long enough to let us get to know and care about the characters.  This is the second book in her Wind Dancer Series...after THE WIND DANCER and before REAP THE WIND.  The book FINAL TAGET is also related to the series.<br />First of all I should mention that this book has two aspects that not all readers might enjoy.  The hero of our story is overbearing.  He's hard on her...he makes her do things that are rough on her but help her in the end.  For the most part the men in this series are a little that way, so if you think that will bother you, this might not be the book for you!  Secondly, this book takes place during the height of the French Revolution.  Some pretty nasty things happen to the aristocrats of the novel...including the main characters.  I don't want to give it all away, but these aren't women that are fresh out of a school room...dancing at balls and meeting men...it is a well-researched romance novel about a war against aristocracy ...including women and children.<br />That being said, I love love loved this book!  Johansen's writing style in great...I loved Juliet, our neglected, frieldless herione.  She has that all too true \\"fix-it\\" attitude with everyone around her takes charge of almost every situation.  The novel takes us all over France, which I liked, and lets us follow the stories of the more minor characters without feeling like we are losing time with the main ones.  We also get some time lapse which was nice because Johansen really let us get to know her in her adolescence and then shows us how that changed her later.  This book is great and I think everyone should check it out!!!	2003-10-03

I enjoyed the book, but not as much as some other Cathy Maxwell novels I have read such as &quot;The Lady is Tempted.&quot;  I liked the characters, but the ending felt rushed.  Everything ends up great all in one chapter after a few chapters of turmoil.  All in all worth the read though, and I will be looking for more from Maxwell in the future!!	2003-10-01

I gave this book four stars because I actually liked it a lot, but I think Deb needed to stand up for herself.  I really disliked her sisters AND their husbands.  I couldn't believe the way she let them treat her.  I guess it took away from the story a little for me.  She runs to everyone's aid and they treat her poorly and she doesn't even seem to notice. She took care of them all and raised them all and now they treat her like a they don't care at all.<br />The romance between Deb and Tony is actually very good...hence my rating of 4 stars.  It is interesting and although this is my first Cathy Maxwell book it won't be my last!	2003-09-29

I hated the first half.  In fact, I actually stopped reading it several times.  I absolutely HATED the boyfriend she went to England with and it just made me not like Dougless from the begining.  I am a very strong woman and don't have much tollerance for women who let men walk all over them!!  I couldn't get over the whole, extensive scenes where they try to convince each other that they really are from another time.  I get that that would be my reaction if someone came foreward in time, but I didn't want to read about it over and over and over!  I forced myself to continue and I am not sorry I did.<br />The historical part of this book was WONDERFUL!  I liked how the author went into the daily lives of 16th century commoners and aristocrats...I can tell she did research and that as all well done.  I knew the ending was coming and I was prepared to be unconvinced, but it was GREAT...how she brought everything together almost made me cry!!!  I couldn't give the book 5 stars since I had to make myself keep reading it twice, but i really liked it in the end and I will definitely re-read the second half of the book!!	2003-06-28

This book is the first of the series, then comes STORM WINDS and then REAP THE WIND and eventually FINAL TARGET is loosely related.  I was a little shocked at the way that Johansen wound everything up so that Lion and Sanchia end up together, but it was well worth it in the long run.<br />If you are looking to start the series, this is the book to start with, but the second book: \\"Storm Winds\\" is by far my favorite of them all!!!	2003-04-25
