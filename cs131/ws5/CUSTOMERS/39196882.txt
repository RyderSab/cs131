Good ideas, poor execution, and totally failed by the editor to make it cohesive.<br /><br />Our hero Christian, is the vampire who was the secondary character of the first book in the series. In that he was portrayed as a little crazy, pretty effeminate, and frankly unattractive.<br /><br />But in this book he's magically tall, dark and Alpha. The heroine from the first book, ostensibly his \\"soul mate\\" married to another man, and her best friend have teamed up to find his \\"real\\" soul mate. It is never fully explained how he can have two.<br /><br />But he does, and the second is named is Allie, another America in Europe. Allie is a summoner. She raises ghosts for a living, and has done so for 7 years despite never having raised a ghost before page 50. The author would have us believe in this universe ghosts are as debated as they are in ours but once Allie raises one she raises many and there is concrete proof of their existence. It's never explained why they are not believed in when they can be shown on film and are regularly.<br /><br />Allie must aid Christian to find another Dark One, held captive by her evil boss who now wishes to possess Allie for...well, I'll be damned. Never did explain why. Inevitably she defeats her boss by discovering the hidden power in herself, made stronger by her bond with Christain.<br /><br />The romantic tension is pretty good, even if the author uses ever romance clich&eacute; in the book (previous abusive husband, virginal attitude towards sex yet she gets real freaky real fast, and Christian is so self assured you want to smack him at certain points). The sex is surprisingly *yawn* boring and repetitive, very uninspired.<br /><br />I bought it used for $3.95 and I wouldn't have paid any more for it. I wouldn't read the first (A Girl's Guide to Vampires - the ULTIMATE misnomer) at all, and this one only if you're REALLY bored and want a vamp book.<br /><br />PS- she also shamelessly uses this book to set the stage for her Aisling Grey series. Thanks to the writing in this one I'll never bother with those books, and neither should you.set the stage for her Aisling Grey series. Thanks to the writing in this one I'll never bother with those books, and neither should you.	2005-09-06

We never know her job, her age, or anything about her other than she is 6 feet tall and bitchy and self centered. Her sidekick is a sex obsessed virgin named Roxy.<br /><br />Addicted to vampire novels about the \\"Dark Ones\\" they spend two weeks at a Goth fest next door to the castle where the author Christian lives.<br /><br />Joy gets the hots for English stud Raphael, nicknamed \\"Bob\\". Oh, we are teased that \\"Bob\\" is a vamp but he isn't. And a brain dead, retarded and blind goat knows his big bad \\"secret\\" by the third page you see him. It's moronic.<br /><br />No plot develops until about 250 pages in when a girl at the fair is murdered.  Oh, for about .00025 seconds we're made to think it COULD be \\"Bob\\" but we know it isn't. Oh, and that aforementioned goat can tell you who did do it.<br /><br />The romance between Joy and \\"Bob\\" has me cringing. She just embarrassed herself every time they met and for some stupid reason he is head over heels in love with Joy, who is little more than a complete moron with tons of TSTL (too stupid to live) moments.<br /><br />So, is there a vampire in all this? Christian, who stalks the bitchy Joy believing she is the one woman who can free his soul, even as she knees him in the balls. We never are told what he looks like, shown that he has a decent IQ or anything worthy of notice.<br /><br />And he's the hero of book 2! Not that you would know this, the back covers tell you sh*t about the stories, so I am so embarrassed that I bought the second one at the same time. I really don't think I'll read it.<br /><br />It's overdone, no plot, little romance, passable sex, and every so often there is humor, but I'd recommend this only to brain dead, retarded and blind goats.	2005-09-02

Because she was raised by Herr Mandenauer, the leader of the Jager-Suchers, the people who hunt the weres.<br /><br />This is a little disjointed. There's more action than the others but it's a little choppy and sometimes the plot focuses too much on it, partly because there is no real villain and no real plot.<br /><br />Elise is paired with an FBI detective she had a passionately chaste relationship with in college before she left him after turning into a were.<br /><br />The heat between them is lukewarm at first but gets much better towards the end. And yet there is no real reason why Nic, the FBI agent, has to stick around.<br /><br />And we find out Elise is a virgin and her first time is, well, in the real world I think in some states it qualifies as rape. REALLY uncomfortable to read and very unbelievable (because she magically has an orgasm and even though she leaves the room sobbing hysterically still wants to do it again).<br /><br />There's too much of an effort to stick ALL of the previous heroes and heroines into this little town and when it becomes too confusing they magically get sent away.<br /><br />This leaves a bookish werewolf and an FBI agent to combat  growing werwolf problemm though neither are tained Jager-Sucher field agents. But wait, there is no problem. People are disappearing, old graves are being desecrated, but no werewolves appear.<br /><br />An old secondary character is killed off and the author sets up a very improbable villain who, 'til the bitter end, I can't say whether or not they were a villain or a helper.<br /><br />And the author forgets the own laws of her universe. Our heroine is a werewolf with free will, killing other wolves because they have none. And she has many TSTL (too stupid to live) moments  whaat make you want to smack your forehead.<br /><br />It's the weakest of the three so far. Not the best one to start with and to be honest, if the first book in the series hadn't been the best paranormal romance I'd ever read, I'd stop reading the series. Here's hoping the next one is better. I know she has it in her.<br /><br />The best thing about this book? Finally, a heroine who isn't a butch ugly wierdo with zero personality. Elise is sweet and caring and you really like her. Nic is a muttonhead you find yourself liking the more you read. there's so much promise in this book, it just doesn't live up to it very well.	2005-08-28

Sticking religiously to the romance novel heroine formula Kenyon made her virginal and frankly, a person with too many TSTL (too stupid to live) moments.<br /><br />Alexion has promise, and also follows the formula. Sexy, confident, mysterious, sexy, intelligent, sexy, and oh, did I mention sexy?<br /><br />The plot is ploddding and slow. Not faced paced as billed, it is choppy and contrived and BORING. If Kenyon actually departed from the usual storyline formula to allow a strong, capable female DH to emerge it might have had a chance.<br /><br />Instead, this one is DOA.<br /><br />It's really easy to figure out who Alexion is. No big mystery, and his identity is a total cop out. Keep reading for a spoiler on why that's true.<br /><br />Like me, have you ever felt so sad for the poor, unfortunate DHs that are killed and forced to walk as shades, thirsting and hungering endlessly? Well, fear no more because now we know that doesn't actually happen to the DHs Ash likes.<br /><br />Kenyon sort of lets us down with regards to Ash, making him seem a little bit too much like a teenager. Here he saves his friends from the Sahde fate and he whines a lot.<br /><br />This book added nothing to the series and we really could have done without it. It's just like Wulf's story where she created it just to needlessly explain a realm in her world we were perfecltly happy not delving too deeply into, and she ruins it.<br /><br />We used to think the Spathis were evil; now we aren;t so sure. We used to think that Shades were the most unfortunate souls; now we know they're not.<br /><br />Ms. Kenyon please stop killing off the dark parts of your series. We need the dark to appreciate the light, a yin to the yang if you will.<br /><br />I would even recommendto faithful readers that they skip this one. Don't start here. And you'll probably need to re-read a few older ones to get it.<br /><br />All in all, if I could give it .5 out 5, I would. where is the tremendoulsy talented characterization of \\"Sieze the Night\\"? Where is the hunor of \\"Night Embrace\\"? This really doesn;t feel like it fits the series.	2005-08-28

Meanwhile her richer `n Croesus best friend buys a huge house in St. Paul and they move in after her house is overrun by termites.<br /><br />Betsy starts to meet vamps paying tribute ad also realizes she can see dead people in a hilarious sequence that builds slowly and perfectly with a girl named Marie.<br /><br />However some people are ambushing and killing female vamps. Betsy finds them and does she kill them? No, sits down to tea and OJ with them! Some vamp is paying them to kill other vamps and they try to discover who it is. But they need the help of super delish Eric Sinclair, King to Betsy's Queen, and top of her s**tlist.<br /><br />Betsy once again naïvely makes her way through vamp politics in a very funny story. Towards the end we see more of Eric's feelings for Betsy and you want to smack her for being so callous towards him. But if she wasn't, she wouldn't be our Betsy.<br /><br />A must read. Sexy, funny, compelling and highly enjoyable!	2005-08-25

This book is side-splittingly funny and engaging, very original and refreshing.<br /><br />Elizabeth \\"Besty\\" Taylor is attacked by vamps and survives. A short time later she is beaned by a homicidal Pontiac and wakes up in the funeral home wearing cheap clothes courtesy her evil stepmother.<br /><br />She discovers she is a vamp who can wear a cross, sneezes at holy water, isn't affected by sunlight and is foretold by prophecy to be the Queen of the Undead.<br /><br />She befriends a suicidal ER doc, scare her stepmother and father witless, resumes a relationship with her mother, and eats the yummy Detective Nick berry accidentally cursing him to madness before an anonymous vamp offers to teach her the skill she needs.<br /><br />This leads her to a meeting with the evil King Nostro and his yummy enemy Eric Sinclair. She wants no part in overthrowing obnoxious Nostro, even if it means helping super sexy Eric.<br /><br />No, Besty wants to resume her shallow life of shoes, shoes and more shoes. Hilarious twists and turns, great characters, and a realistic heroine (even if she is a super vamp) mark this book as genius.<br /><br />Besty is a shallow and slightly idiotic twit, but she has a tremendously good heart and always does the right thing...even if it's only because she's bribed with gorgeous pumps.<br /><br />You'll root for her at every turn and will love this one. I think anybody can appreciate this book.	2005-08-25

Sorry, but please don't jump down my throat. I LOVE Underworld and like I said the story ROCKED but I wish they'd get a new writer.<br /><br />Selene is watching the lycans and an arms dealer when she is mysteriously attacked by someone killing her vamp partner and two lycans. Before she can investigate, we are thrown back in time...<br /><br />Lucian was born a werewolf (lycan) and as a baby was enslaved by Viktor, a vamp elder. He has grown up thinking he is better than the rest of the \\"dirty beasts\\" and madly in love with Viktor's daughter, princess Sonja.<br /><br />When he saves her from an ambush they are alone and start to admit their feelings.<br /><br />However, Sonja is soon engaged to an odious vampire prince and in desperation seeks Lucian out. The affair begins and soon enough they are pregnant and marry themselves in a secret ceremony. They plan to escape but are betrayed by a lycan bitch who wants Lucian for herself.<br /><br />As punishment Sonja is burned alive and Lucian is whipped but escapes. Enraged he seeks out wild lycans and forms an army, capturing the vamps' silver mine. However the vamps regroup and slaughter his forces, making him retreat and laying the seeds of a much greater lycan army, that battle should be told in \\"Underworld: Evolution\\".<br /><br />Back in the present Selene kicks butt, takes names, and discovers who is trying to kill the lycans and vamps alike. In the process she almost discovers a secret plot...<br /><br />Great plot but HORRID writing. Try this on for size: \\"the catapults rumbled down the road with the force of...well, catapults\\". It's paraphrasing, but I mean, yeech!<br /><br />Only for the most rabid Underworld fans and please take an Excedrin before you read and spread it over a few days.	2005-08-25

She discovers she has a half sister born of Ant (and her dad's) infidelity, and that this sister is the daughter of the devil (who possessed Ant and NOBODY NOTICED! lol), fated to rule the world.<br /><br />Betsy must find her and see if the prophecy is true. In her own bumbling way she does this but along the way frees a fiend and has him knitting in her basement, seriously abuses Eric until he tells her to go to hell (way to go my man!) and that finally makes her see what a shallow twit she's been to him.<br /><br />She reads the book of the dead too long and turns evil for a night, alienating all the people she loves. Still, Betsy is good at heart and triumphs, winning back Eric and the gang, befriending her sister, telling Satan \\"blow me\\" and kicking serious vamp butt.<br /><br />The Satan encounter is amazing because the Devil tempts her with one of a kind kill-your-own-mother-to-own shoes to trade for her soul.<br /><br />Not as much action as the first two and probably about 10% less laughs than the first, 5% less than #2 but still great. I think people don't like this because Eric isn't slaving over Betsy all the time. But I appreciated it; I prefer believability in my characters, even if they are undead. She rapes him for heck's sake! (while evil because of the book of the Dead) What kind of a man is just going to let that go?<br /><br />It's in the same (dumb joke here) vein as the first two and  I`d really like to have the next one in hand. So much better fleshed out than Sookie Stackhouse, so much less scary than (the sexually sadistic) Anita Blake. Queen Betsy is so air headed, so shallow-but-sweet that you have to love her.<br /><br />She is the sloppy golden retriever of two legged lampreys, and all her sidekicks are in fine form.<br /><br />Please Ms, Davidson, I want to know more about Tina and Eric's past. Please?	2005-08-25

And they say there are 2 short stories that came before, and they are erotica? PUH-LEAZE!<br /><br />No plot. Oh, it pretends to have one. Morgan LeFay is reincarnated into the body of a gorgeous absent-minded nurse named Sara. Derik is a newly alpha werewolf who must leave his pack so he doesn't kill his best friend and current alpha. Sent by a surly psychic to kill Sara before she brings about the end of the world, he instead falls for her.<br /><br />He can't kill her because she is lucky. That's her big major sorceress power! She's...lucky? So she survives and like a total moron, decide to go cross country with the man who just tried to kill her.<br /><br />How do they know where to go? Her surly BOSS tells them the followers of King Arthur need to kill her to bring Arthur back, and the men they want are in Salem, Massachusetts. Real original. Every time Davison realizes the plot makes no sense she gives us a surly character to explain things in a bitchy narrative style.<br /><br />Okay, there is never an explanation about why the men want Arthur to rise, why Derik is the one sent to kill her (after all, they have wolves much closer than his 3,500 mile distance from her), and why her BOSS knows the truth of she is but for all the time he's known her never mentioned it.<br /><br />Okay, so maybe the romance is good, you suggest? The sex is awful, and the romance does not exist. The first time they have sex is no foreplay and he gets off in like ten seconds. But dumb Sara, she wants another go (yeah...right) and again the same thing. But magically, on the third try it's half as good as normal romance novel sex. Davidson decides at this point they are in love enough, and you've read enough sex to totally skip over the rest of their encounters. That's about as much romance as she puts in.<br /><br />They fall in love for no discernable reason. It's really hard to read because it seems Davidson, Derik AND Saraall have ADHD (don't jump on me- I have it too but God is it annoying to people who don't).<br /><br />SKIP IT and be glad. Worst werewolf story EVER. But her vamp stories do rock, so read those instead.	2005-08-25

He meets a werewolf with pink hair named Keeli one night, and through circumstance they become partners, working for the cops and hunting a creature. The creature kills vamps and leaves them mauled, leaving behind werewolf and vamp DNA before he burns them.<br /><br />Keeli is the outcasted granddaughter of the Alpha of the Alphas, Grand Dame Maddox. Haunted by a violent past Keeli is horrified to find herself in love with Michael. Both must overcome their prejudices to work together and save an alliance. The alliance will bring wolves and vamps closer but not everyone is happy. They must fight from all sides.<br /><br />Okay, for the most part here is how you get this book. Mix the following:<br /><br />Movie: Underworld (plot: wolves and vamps at war and one of each falling in love a la Romeo and Juliet, not dying but creating a hybrid of both)<br /><br />Movie: LXG (Keelie's relationship with her wolf is like that of Dr. Jeckle to Mr. Hyde)<br /><br />Songs: Several Sarah McLaughlin lyrics pop up, maybe subconsciously<br /><br />Book: Linda Lael Miller's Forever and the Night (The wooing between man and woman is darn near identical, dancing on the air)<br /><br />Book: Sherrilyn Kenyon's Night series. (Several similarities in characters and the term \\"bolt-hole\\" is applied here strangely, Ms. Kenyon originated the idea as a link to a hiding place)<br /><br />Book: Laurell K Hamilton (the characters' abilities to overcome prejudices without any real reason is similar to Hamilton's main character, Anita)<br /><br />So know that if you are familiar with these elements, most of this book is well traveled ground. But the plot is decent when you look at the action. More interesting is Keeli's struggle to overcome her temper and deal with her grandmother.<br /><br />About two hundred pages before it ends you know who the killer is. And the romance is flat. It reads more like a porn story with two monogamous characters. You just have to accept they love each other at first sight though they are abusive to each other verbally and physically. At first Keeli brings new meaning to the term bitch.<br /><br />The tone is uneven and the human characters are not so good, but this book shows promise. I think Ms. Liu has a bright future but she needs to focus more on paranormal plots, not murder mysteries, and try harder for more original backgrounds.	2005-08-19

Our heroine has alienated her human boyfriend, makes friends with a werewolf insurance adjustor and gets paid by one of Trent Kalmack's bodyguards to guard him. In the process she matches wits with a master ley line witch trying to take over the city now that Piscary is behind bars.<br /><br />She manages to outsmart the demon Al and land the yummy Kisten, all the while slowly understanding vampires a bit more. There is a lot less homo-erotic tension between her and Ivy (thank goodness!) and less choppy action scenes, save for one in a showdown with the ley line witch at the end.<br /><br />She travels to the demon's dimension finally and also understands what ebing a familiar is like, how much she hurt Nick using him to draw power.<br /><br />Sad to say Jenks (who is such great comic relief) doesn't get much page time in this one, but it's so we can focus more on the plot.<br /><br />It's a worthy read but you may have to re-read the last two in order to be ready for this one. Al in all great; a fast page turner but sad to say there was only one sex scene. Still it was better than Laurell K Hamilton's out-and-out porn (which iss just reading more and more egomaniacal these days), but I would have liked a bit more steamy scenes in this one.<br /><br />A must have for the fantasy vamp/witch lover. Well rounded characters and believable tension, the action is a lot sharper and better written in this one. Can't wait for the next one!	2005-08-05

By contrast he hs all the ear markings of a werewolf, always showing up just after she meeets  brown werwolf who's portecting her, killing other werewolves.<br /><br />Leigh obsteively has been called to Crow Valley to train last book's heroine Jessie McQuade and Jessie's boyfriend Will Cadotte. It's a little strange how much of a part these two characters play so there aren't as many secondary characters to rely on as red herrings. It drives character development but the plot gets a little saggy in the middle as a result.<br /><br />Through much talk and a ton of confusing dialogue (it's really hard to keep track of who's talking) we find out that a Super Werewolf is coming. with a special ceremony on some moon the almost impossible to kill wolf shall be reborn (folloing an Ojibwe legend). Um, hello, a new plot, please?<br /><br />This one is a serial killer cannibal who was cursed to b a werewolf because of his appetites. He is Hector, Leigh's one time infedlity. To become a semi-super werewolf he promised the Ojibwe dark ones a sacrifice-her family.<br /><br />Now he needs to find Liegh-- his mate, and have sex with her on the night of the Hunter's Moon to become the biggest badass werewolf- impervious to death about as much as the werewolf God.which, you giuessed it, means he's really easy to kill but our heroes will not figure it out until the last minute.<br /><br />We have the same \\"is her man a werewolf? Is he not?\\" And Damien is just nowehere near as charming as Will, but he is funny. I actually preferred him because he does not magically appear naked from the woods, he comes running out of them at full tilt sweaty and disheveled.<br /><br />Suprirses of surprises as the plot developes we see Leigh making really stupid rookie mistkes that betray her hard-bitten description, just as Jessie did at the end of the last book. Seems Ms. handeland can't back away totally from the helpless female idea of romance novels.<br /><br />We also find out Hector the supreme werewolf is hiding in town, he could be anyone. When you look back on it you realize only one secondary character had lines. Wait a minute, he didn't! Not a single secondary caracter did in this book. He just had the most description.<br /><br />Sensual, well paced, but lacking in the genius twists and turns of the previous novel. But it is a series and you must read this one to understand the coming one, and it is nice to see Will and Jessie are just as in love as ever.<br /><br />It's still much better than most paranormal faire, but I'm a little disappointed in ths after reading the first. The third has promise so I'm definitely holding out.	2005-06-16

Oh, this book has everything I've ever wanted from a paranormal romance!<br /><br />First person narration from tough, no nonsense small town cop Jessie McQuade. Sexy (maybe)wolfmen and an ancient evil with attitude.<br /><br />Jessie finds a woman bitten by a wolf on one late night. It doesn't sit well with her the woman didn't get a rabies shot so she goes to visit the victim only to find her foaming at the mouth and eating her boss (*sigh* remind me, why is that a crime?).<br /><br />She meets incredibly sexy William Cadotte, summer shool professor and naked tai chi enthusiast. She also meets Herr Mandenauer, a very old ass kicking German with a buried sense of humor.<br /><br />She must work with Mandenauer to rid her little town of werewolves, and has just days until the Blue Moon to kill the head werewolf. What's her biggest problem? Her nudist balcony hopping boyfriend is the prime suspect.<br /><br />She is met with small town vigilantism and people who want her to stop seeing Will because \\"he's so darn pretty and she ain't\\". All through it she keeps her sharp wit and her \\"take no prisoners\\" attitude.<br /><br />The two main characters are well rounded and pop off the pages, the sex is steamy and it was a true page turner. I got twists and turns thrown at me that were ingenious and I have to admit until it was revealed I had no idea who the head werewolf was.<br /><br />The hardest thing to swallow is the \\"history\\" of the werewolves, but if you've read her prior short stories in the series you'll get it. Just suspend your disbelief there because this book is a must read.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for anyone that likes normal suspense romance, and anyone that likes paranormal. Or if you've ever wanted to read this genre, here is a great place to start.	2005-06-11

The sex starts out as sensual but then gets to be, well, kind of boring. Hey, no matter how creative you are, if you do it the same way every time it turns *yawn*.<br /><br />The romance between Reece and our heroine is kind of meandering and I just don't get why they fall in love. Doesn't make sense. They have hot sex, she's a whiny bag of needs, and they kick supernatural butt. I see no reason why they can;t live without each other, why they make each other better together than apart. That's why characters fall in love normally, and it's missing here.<br /><br />The plot is also meandering, she tries to stick two completely seperate plots together. A serial killer and the big daddy of all bad vampire demons.<br /><br />The vampire plot is superb and well paced but the serial killer one is slow and halting, and has an ending I would describe only as \\"suddenly I am run over by a truck\\".<br /><br />It has none of the absolute steam of her Lancelot and Galahad short stories (which just rock) but you should read this one before reading \\"Master of the Moon\\" which reclaims her status as an incredible writer.<br /><br />The next one, Master of the Moon, has all of the elements this one is missing. This story should not be read with the purpose of being a romance novel: it is a science fiction/horror novel that borders on pronography.	2005-06-10

I couldn't decide as I read the first half; \\"do I love it or am I slightly disappointed?\\"<br /><br />I couldn't decide as I read the last if I should laugh or cry.<br /><br />The hero is a man we've been made to dislike in previous novels but in this we find Valerius is a lonely man desperate for love and comfort, the most touching of the Dhs actually. The heroine is a wacky background character who becomes so fleshed out I'd swear Tabitha is real, and I probably know her.<br /><br />The other DHs come back and there's a touching moment when Kyrian, the only now mortal DH explains to Ash the horrid reality of having high cholestoral and knowing he is mortal.<br /><br />Ms. Kenyon could be the first romance novelist to ever make her previous heroes have moments of childish stupidity that make them all the more endearing for not being perfect.<br /><br />I was at first disappointed because the villain of the first novel, who's now dead, comes back to be the villain of this novel, but Ms. Kenyon is so creative with it I bought into it completely. She introduces new twist in the world of SPathi warriors.<br /><br />This novel is her best to date in the series. Past characters become more solid and realistic, things happen you won't believe. Reading this on the train the last 1/3rd kept me gasping until the lady in the seat next to me thought I was having a heart attack.<br /><br />The end peters out but has interested me more than any generic \\"happily ever after\\" ending. We see two people dealing with immortality and mortality much more realistically than ever before. You want to weep for them it's so grabbing.<br /><br />All in all, the best part is we see much more insight into Acheron which only makes me desperately need to know when his novel is coming out!<br /><br />DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!	2004-12-30

It felt predictible and was just turning into pointless porn with too much action.<br /><br />But this one won me back. Okay, there isn't a plot at all, there's mostly sex and subplots including Ronnie's relationship with Louie the were-rat as the only plot that has a conclusion... no wait a minute! that didn't either!<br /><br />Anita is charged with hunting down a pack of rogue serial killer vamps who hunt strippers. In the meantime she ignores Michah, finally does the deed with Nathaniel, almost ignores Jean Paul and does the nasty with Richard. That's the plot right there.<br /><br />Do they ever find the rogue vampires? No. Does Anita inexplicably gain more supernatural powers? Yes.<br /><br />But the writing style is lucid and imaginative and the details of the characters are so like the very first novels. The ending leaves you wanting more and if this book doesn't stimulate your creative juices you must be dead and not lovin' it.	2004-12-30

Bored with romance novels and the simpering fidelity and overly flowery language therein? So was I so I ventured into erotica. The price of the ticket was well worth it.<br /><br />Like many heterosexual females I'm intrigued by two men, or a woman and two men. If you're not stay away for there is that aplenty.<br /><br />It's probably some of the best writing I've ever seen in any category. Believable well rounded characters, really well reserached 18th century speech and clothing as well as settings, and penty of steaminess. Ms. Ellis makes you wait for every encounter and builds the anticipation. So when it comes, wow. All I can say is wow.<br /><br />My only beef is that the lesbian scene in the beginning seems abrupt and nowehere near as believable as the other sex scenes. Partly because it takes place with the unlikely Louisa, a virgin with a voyeur streak a mile wide who seems much more like a typical romance heroine than Bella, the main character.<br /><br />A must read for the enlightened female!	2004-08-25

Women are in charge, men are virginal, and it's a futuristic regency place.<br />So original, great as a satire, steamy, erotic, interesting. I found myself in love with Jorlan and Green who are really well rounded.<br />It was interesting to read of a world where women are in charge and end up subjegating men just as men did us. Fascinating, but probably realistic. We would be just as petty as men.<br />A few things at the end don't make sense, but the entire novel is beautifully written. The scenery and imagination is lush, the characters fascinating, and the plot slow but you don't really notice.<br />Jorlan is about to be sold to Claudine, the mortal enemy of Green, the woman Jorlan secretly lusts after. To save him Green puts aside her kept pleasurer (um, Mister?) and marries him, introducing him to the world of sensual arts and land management.<br />Jorlan has surprises. He's a skilled intuitive lover because he's a sensitive- he's tied to the planet and has an affinity with all living things. He's aslo a deadly martial arts master posessing knowledge denied men on the planet.<br />Caludine tries to posion Green's people and destroy her, but only with Jorlan's help can Green win.<br />This introduced me to Dara Joy and most of her books have been worthy reads. This was the first I read and I'm still convinced the best.<br />I was sad to visit her site and see River (Green's pleasurer) was going to be the hero in the next novel. I guess we're going back to the viriginal woman, experienced man type romance.<br />Bummer.	2004-07-15

(Well, haven't read the 4th)	I give it a 5 of 5, not because it's perfect but because if you read the first two this book is exactly what you think it should be, hope for, and expect.<br />Sookie finds out that Bill (the dullest and most tedious vampire ever imagined) has been cheating on her! (A-ha! knew I didn't like him for a reason). He's working on a secret mission for the Queen of LA (yes the sate) and he direly tells her if he goes missing to check her crawl space.<br />So, scene two, Bill goes missing (yipee!). She finds some computer disks but doesn't look at them, wierd, then Eric, Bill's boss asks her to find him.<br />She finds out he was leaving her for his vampire lover when he was kidnapped in MS. She has to investigate that kingdom and her entree in is sexy werewolfe Alcide.<br />So she goes to find her errant lover and shack up with the very tempting wolf. Eric comes in disguise to follow her repeatedly almost seducing her (lord but he's so much sexier than Bill, I wish she'd chose him) and the hijinks begin. It's a little darker than its predcesors, but the characters grow as you'd expect them to.<br />Sadly, Sookie has a few TSTL (too stupid to live- got that from another reader) moments. I mean, she wants to forgive Bill even though he was leaving her and had been cheating on her. Gimme a break, no man is worth that humiliation. And she turns down Eric though she wants him badly, even comes dagerously close to full blown sex. In fact, what they do would be considered in many countries sex, but not by most Americans' standards.<br />It's highly entertaining and had me laughing more then the first two and the characters seem so much more fleshed out, so much more real. Totally worthy read! The ending had me hooting with laughter and I've got to read the fourth. Once again I highly recommend!	2004-07-13

I thought Ms. Harris had lots of potential. In this book I really feel she's living up to it!<br /><br />It's great. Sookie gets loaned out to Dallas vamps to find a member of a vampire nest that's gone missing. She goes with her boyfriend dull vamp Bill and Bill's boss Eric who's incognito.<br /><br />She uses her telepathy to find out the missing vamp has been taken by a cult out to kill all vampires.<br /><br />She and a fellow human-in-love-with-a-vamp try to spring him and it gets messy. They meet a suicidal pedophilic vampire, a huge shapeshifter community, and honest-to-goodness werewolves.<br /><br />It's really similar to Anita Blake, minus the Dirty Harry atitude. In this novel Sookie is so much more real than the first story. Sadly, Bill is once again dull (what does she see in him? he so irritates me) and he's ALWAYS missing when there's action going on. Once again as I read this I have to wonder what makes vamps better lovers than humans? We get no real explanation at it, so be ready to suspend your disbelief.<br /><br />This one made me laugh and had some sad parts. Not nearly as erotic as the first, but we see Sookie growing more to understand her own sexuality by bits and pieces.<br /><br />I think this is a big improvement over the first and it shows not only Sookie growing but Ms. Harris as well. I've read the next one and the series just gets better with every book.<br /><br />I'm recommending this to all my friends and I would to anybody who's ever enjoyed a vampire book or movie in their life. It's great!	2004-07-13

It's erotic and wildly imaginative, but the writing style gave me a headache. It's hard to know what's going on, but maybe that's because the story is told from Kerry's viewpoint, and she's mildly psychotic.<br />\\"No Mercy\\" is yet another story about a man and woman who once were madly in love but then it fell through, and yet they give it one more shot. Who'd be dumb enough to do that in real life? The characters are weak and unbelievable and the steaminess factor is a no show. Sad, because Thea Devine is normally a great author.<br />\\"Satisy Me\\" is the first in a series of three short stores, the next two plaid out in the \\"Bad Boys\\" series. It's a brilliant idea, great writing, and it toally draws you in. It's slightly absurd though how virginal the heroine is, but that's half of Ms. Foster's trademark. A worthy read.<br />\\"Something Wild\\" is dark and unelievably erotic. Annie is fleeing a bad knock from life in a crummy car and borrowed time. On the road to Lousinanna she meets dark and sexy Jacob, a biker dude extraordinaire. Wow, did this story have possibilities. And I was glued to the plot, couldn't put it down. It gets weird, the lne between \\"ravish\\" and \\"rape\\" seems dangerously thin at points and the heroine seems really childish. but it keeps Annie fleshed out and I've gone back to read this story time after time.<br />It's totally worth checking out, the stories are all fairly dark and erotic and overall good.	2004-07-12

It seemed interestng and at first I eagerly read on. She's a wacky novelist who smokes and devours M&Ms, and then her hero comes alive. And if things got any more interesting from that point on, a funeral would have broken out.<br /><br />Saint Just is BORING and his talk is so, well, everybody else has said it and I'll say it too. CONTRIVED!<br /><br />I hear rumors that a plot developes, where? I quit reading because I couldn't find a pulse in the darn thing. And now I hear there's a sequel? Dear God, nooo!<br /><br />Don't even bother with it, lest of course your morbid curiosity demands it. In that case, check it out from the library or read it at the bookstore, just don't buy it.

Her brother is a suspect and things seem to be falling apart as people believe it's either Jason, the brother, or Bill the lover.<br />Well, this novel has promise. I have yet to read the following ones but I will and I hope they're better.<br />Bill is 2 dimensional, he always disappears whenever any action goes on and he has no emotions whatsoever. Sookie in contrast is hot headed and acts without thought. She's kind of selfish and self involved and every man in town is in love with her. That reminded me of Anita Blake and why on earth must these women in these novels be the subject of such blind adoration from man, vamp, and shapeshifter alike? Give me a break.<br />Her grandmother's death is convenient, I think it's because Ms. Harris had no further use for the character, and no one seems to really grieve the woman.<br />The writing seems hurried and more often than not the secondary characters in town are more interesting than the main players. However, it's a good premise and shows promise.<br />I really found it impossible to like Bill and see no reason to explain why a vampire lover is better thna a human. And his relationship with Sookie is kind of sad, she's very childish and impatient with him and he's a bit of a jerk.<br />At leastMs. Harris comes up with a thoroughly more plausible explanation for the heroine's seeming invincibility than Ms. Hamilton does with her heroine, but she makes it hard for us to love Sookie.<br />I do reccommend this to anyone who thinks Anita Blake books are getting too silly what with Anita sleeping around so much and denying her lovers freedom. I'd also recommend it if vampire romances in general make you roll your eyes, this one is so much better thought out and interesting than those.<br />However, if you're new to the genre start out with Sherrilyn Kenyon and the first few Laurell K hamilton books before trying Ms. Harris. You'll appreciate this book's refreshing viewpoint much more that way.	2004-07-11

To sum up this novel: two hours of my life I can NEVER get back.<br />First off, there's no romance. I swear NO ROMANCE in it. Just a heroine and her creepy neighbor. She wants to dig up roman ruins on his land. He wants nothing to do with her.<br />Her best friend is manipulative. She wants the vamp and when he refuses her she addicts him to drugs (can that even happen to the undead?)<br />Our heroine nurses him back to health, doormat that she is. And in flashbacks she reveals once using drugs and losing her virginity to an underage boy in a threesome.<br />I mean, what the h**l?<br />I couldn't finish it and I've read all 1,000+ pages of Anna Karenina when I didn't want to, so you can see how usually I'll finish any book.<br />But this one was so bad I even tried to return it for my money back. The bookstore wouldn't take it so I tried to get something from the publisher, even a partial refund.<br />I sold it at a garage sale last year and guess what? Two days later it got returned. I refunded the fifty cents and threw it out.<br />This book could be the worst ever published.<br />Stick to more modern vamp romances or more established authors like Christine Feehan, you'll be sooooo happy if you take my advice. trust me.	2004-07-08

There I was, so in love with her novella \\"Something Wilde\\" from \\"I Brake for Bad Boys\\" that I was just panting for another story.<br />So eagerly I bought this and Wilde Thing. I read Wilde thing first and it was imaginative and steamy. In comparison, this read like stereo instructions.<br /><br />She writes one helluva hot novella but her full length novels are slow to develop. In this one we have rich girl meets blue collar boy and it's just sadly predictible.<br />You find yourself wondering why she has to hide her name from him so bad, why she keeps being such a b***h to him, and why he keeps taking her back.<br />Add to that a sex scene which involves the champagne bottle seen on the cover, YIKES! and you have a story that's uncomfortable and not romantic.<br />It was a pretty good idea and well written in terms of details and charcater interraction, but I have one beef with it. She keeps setting things in Chicago and as a native to the Second City I barely recognize any facet of the town in it. I mean, ugh. Anonymous coffee shops? Betsy Johnson boutique on Michigan Avenue? No way. I know Ms. Dennison lives n Italy but I think I'll mail her a guide to the city.<br />Sorry I didn't rehash the plot, didn't think I needed to. This one might be worth reading, particularly if you're determined to keep the flow of the Wilde stories going, but if you're new to Ms. Dennison, don't start here.	2004-07-08

But who's his heroine? She's an Appollite Princess hunted by Spathi warriors to bring about... well that Ms. Kenyon never quite makes clear.<br />Cassandra makes you want to weep for the Appollites. She's almost to her dying day and she screams in her mind how she wants to live. Your heart aches for her.<br />The feelings between Cass and Wulf are nonexistent. They have hot, hot HOT sex in their mutual dreams, but in person the sexual chemistry is so that you half expect him to adopt her.<br />They must run from the most fearsome Spathi warrior and his son and so they escape to an Appollite town underground. Here's where it gets bizarre. Cass's sister is alive and a Daimon. And the big bad Spathi's son Urian is her Daimon lover.<br />Kenyon makes you really feel for the Appollities and the Daimons. So at the end you're wondering \\"how can I read more Dark Hunter novels now? I like the Appollites!\\"<br />Add to that an ending that makes you roll your eyes, and well, this seems like a half hearted effort. Ms. Kenyon could you PLEASE stop giving us Dark Hunter's who A: actually have a soul and are too dumb to walk out in the sunlight to test it (like Zarek) and B: get a chance to take revenge on the people who wronged them, and yet the forgo it(Like, well, all of the nancy boys)?

Tall, dark, handsome, devoted to his duty as an army officer and to his men he needs excitement.<br /><br />Enter LaReina, the singing duchess. She's actually a mountain girl, daughter of famous explorers who's sister Laurel has been kidnapped. For ransom she must transport gold in her giant coach under the cover of a singing tour.<br /><br />Her friend sent for one man to escort her but since he died Ring the tight-butt comes along to spar verbally with her and warily watch her three hired companions.<br /><br />Filled with beautiful descriptions of Native Americans, really colorful secondary characters, and great humor that will have you giggling this is a timeless escape.<br /><br />And the love between these two characters is so real it will instantly make you remember how it feels to fall in love. No hate-love here it's simple attraction and two very well rounded characters with their own wounds and insecurities coming together in desperate times.<br /><br />The sex is very minimal and towards the end but this is the most sensual thing I've ever read. The anticipation that builds between these two will have you chasing your honey that night.<br /><br />How I wish they'd make a movie of this novel! But for now, I'll keep reading it, and it would be so terrible if you missed this one.<br /><br />Admitedly, the follow up \\"Wishes\\" about their son is very funny but lackluster in comparison, but you revisit with these heroes.

But I will say people fell in love with the prudish Episcopalian Anita Blake who was almost 2 dimensional and flat. And people, remember, always remember how young Anita Blake is.<br />Through the series she's been growing and so to read this one first would be a jumbled shock to the system. Read them in order and you'll see how she grows.<br />Admitedly Dolph's anger and Richard's depression are, well sad and useless to me. I've always hated Richard the gorgeous but wimpy boy scout who can eat your face. I wish he'd just slink off.<br />This one is as good, if not better than NIC, way better than and I mean way than OB. But if you liked the first eight you might find this one disappointing.<br />It's very long and poorly edited but the ideas are gorgeous and it's a good escape. I've been a fan since GP and I'll read to the end.<br />PS<br />to REALLY understand not only character development, but Laurell's development as a writer, read Guilty Pleasures through Obsidian Butterfly. Notice in OB how Laurell AND Anita have gotten sick of the whole scene. Then read the first two Merry gentry novels, then go back to Narcissus in Chains and read on. It flows seamlessly and you'll get Anita Blake a lot more.	2004-06-20

I've worn mine out and have had to buy new editions.<br />This story is humorous at turns, dramatic, unbelievably well researched, and above all the purest testimony to what love truly is.<br />It's unique for a time travel romance with Nicholas the errant and wickedly sensual knight tugged into late 1980's England by abandoned tourist Dougless, a naive woman.<br />Investigating how to get him back is full of chuckles and sensuality. When he does go back Dougless gets pulled along and it was hilarious.<br />Needless to say they cannot live in the same time. I'm not normally a crier but this book makes me bawl like a two year old without her nap. And I read it probably twice a year, every year since it came out.<br />This book is sophisticated, smart, funny, sensual, and perhaps the most romantic I've ever read. Why perhaps?

Then she meets the duke and dissolves into a simpering mass of the worst of female qualities, which made me roll my eyes.<br />The middle lags because of it but soon she's back on the case and it picks up. A worthwhile read...	2002-05-01
