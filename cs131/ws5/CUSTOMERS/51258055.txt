I couldn't get it off my hands until it was over and that hasn't happened to me since I read the \\"Heart of the Condor\\" some time ago.<br />There is only one \\"flaw\\" in this book: it is not an original plot. I know most romance books tend to have many similarities in plot but in this case it is not just a similarity. Rather the plot is an exact replica of Jude Deveraux's all time classic \\"A knight in shining armor\\", which was written many years ago.<br />On the other hand, despite being a copy-cat (and thus the author can't be praised for her brilliant idea), it is a book that stands finely on its own and it's highly addictive!<br />The plot of the book is this: A modern woman named Gwen goes on a trip in the highlands in order to find her perfect man. She literally falls over him and manages to awaken the highland laird from an enchanted sleep. Although she is attracted to him, she can't believe that he is from the 16th century, but agrees to help him return to his family castle anyway. Drustan, gets to know some of the wonders of technology (car, jeans, etc) but is also very attracted by the innocent Gwen. When they reach the place where his castle was, they find only ruins. Drustan knows that he has to return to his century and make sure that the family line continues. The fact that Drustan is a druid adds an interesting twist in the book and is the only difference between this book and \\"Knight in shining armor\\". Before Drustan gets back to his time though, he falls in love with Gwen and she with him. But because of a mistake Drustan makes, Gwen finds herself in his century where she meets a Drustan who doesn't even remember her! Can Gwen alone save Drustan's life and thus his clan's family line? Can she find a way so that she and Drustan live happily ever after?<br />Though the answer in these questions is obvious, I guarantee you will have a wonderful time reading this book and not once regret buying it. I am now certainly going to buy \\"The Dark Highlander\\" and find out what happens with Drustan's brother, Dageus.<br />Also, if you haven't read \\"A knight in a shining armor\\" and you liked this book, go and order it right away. Even if their plot is the same, both authors are masterful story-tellers, each with her own style, and these books are among the best about time-travelling.Dark Highlander\\" and find out what happens with Drustan's brother, Dageus. <BR>Also, if you haven't read \\"A knight in a shining armor\\" and you liked this book, go and order it right away.

I certainly didn't love it or became enthralled by it as most reviewers seem to claim. To me the humor was good, especially the dialogues between Reggie and Damian were really hilarious, but otherwise the plot was too contrived. I would also prefer much more, that the revelations about Reggie at the end of the book never took place because it completetely refutes Reggie's character and originality.<br />The fact that I didn't like at all is the numerous religious arguments appearing in the book. No one seems to mention this fact in their reviews, but if I knew it earlier I would never have bought the book in the first place. I believe they were too many for a romance book and certainly one that claims to have such a hot hero! In accordance to this, the heroine was too good, loving, caring and honest to be true, even for a historical romance where all heroines are always as pure as water. It's the male characters, Damian and Reggie, that keep the story going and the humor floating.<br />Perhaps, if I hadn't read all those 5 star reviews, I wouldn't feel so disappointed, since it wasn't a bad book anyway but merely an average one.	2002-11-22

The two of them were married when they were just children in order to bring the two families close and never met after that.<br />As they grow up they both realise they don't want to keep this wedding. Julia leaves her home to become an actress and Damon searches for her in order to get an annulment. They meet without knowing each other's identity and find they are attracted. When Julia realises that Damon is her husband, she tries to get away from him but Damon runs after her. After finding out that she is actually his wife, he is begining to think that their marriage might not be so bad after all. Julia refuses to stay with him though, because she knows he will ask her to stop her career as an actress but Damon won't take \\"no\\" for an answer...<br />I read \\"Somewhere I'll find you\\" after reading \\"Because you're mine\\". I loved \\"because you're mine\\" and consider it one of the best books of Kleypas after \\"Dreaming of you\\" and \\"Then came you\\".<br />\\"Somewhere I'll find you\\" was a nice book and a definite page turner. But after I finished reading it I realised one thing: the two main characters (Julia and Damon) have never shared a true conversation in the whole book! They never really talk about anything: their likes and dislikes, their interests, why Julia loves the theater so much, why Damon is so rigid and autocratic. All these come as realisations and deductions to each other. In fact, the only powerful attraction between them seems to be sex rather than love.<br />Besides being an entertaining book, since Kleypas has the talent to write moving scenes and keep your interest, it is the most empty (from feelings) book I've read from her. When did lust became a synonym for love? As soon as it was over I felt that I didn't knew any of the characters and really don't care much about what happened to them afterwards. Besides the whole idea of their marriage, on which the story relies on, seems to be a little unstable since they both seem to acknowledge at the end of the book that their marriage was not a valid one anyway!<br />I would suggest saving your time and skip this book. If on the other hand you are a Kleypas fan as I am and have plenty of time in your hands, you certainly will spend a few pleasant hours reading it.since they both seem to acknowledge at the end of the book that their marriage was not a valid one anyway! <BR>I would suggest saving your time and skip this book.

I couldn't stop laughing while reading it, much to my husband's regret who was desperately trying to sleep and the fact that I kept re-reading the funny passages again and again didn't help at all! The way poor Radcliffe finds himself attracted to a young boy \\"Charles\\" and starts to wonder for his sexual preferences is incredibly hilarious.<br />In a few words, the story goes as follows: The earl of Radcliff meets a yound couple, a brother named \\"Charles\\" and his sister \\"Beth\\" trying to escape from their uncle. Much to their dismay (!), he offers to escort them to London, settle them in his house and introduce them to the ton as his relatives so that Beth can find a husband to escape from her uncle's plans. Although Beth is a very attractive woman, he finds himself attracted to her brother, Charlie! Radcliff is shocked by his response, but when he finally admits to himself that he is indeed attracted to \\"him\\", he finds out that he is also attracted to Beth... only at certain times! Little does he know that the brother and sister are in fact twin sisters and keep switching places as Charlie and Beth. As if this is not enough, a blackmailer appears that threatens to reveal the twins' secret.<br />How much longer can the twins keep their secret? Who is the vilain? Will Radcliff find out the truth before he loses his mind? Get the book and find that out!! I only regret that this book has been in my \\"to read list\\" for over a year and I only decided to read it last week. I will certainly not loose time again and go right away to order the other books of Mrs Sands! Don't make the same mistake with me if you haven't read this book. Go and get it right away!	2002-08-12

He is a man that talks little, never laughs and keeps his thoughts to himself. When he is ordered by the king to take Emily in his castle he tries to stay away from her as she is the daughter of his enemy and also believes that his rage could prove uncontrollable when it comes to her. But what surprises him is that Emily is not afraid of him as everyone else is. She stands up to him, speaks her own mind and she is determined to get him to marry her! They are attracted to each other but too many obstacles stand between them. Of course, as in every romance they find a way to get through them and live happily ever after.<br />The humor was perfectly balanced with Draven's tortured past so you couldn't name it a light read not a heart-wreching one. It certainly was extremely easy to read and I couldn't leave it of my hands. Emily is determined, willful and also romantic and sweet. Draven is the typical medeival hero: gorgeous, tough outside but warm for those who know him.<br />Go out and read it!!!	2002-08-05

Royce Van Cleef accepts a bet from his friends that he will manage to court and gain the heart of Lady Laurel. She is attracted to him at first but whn she finds out about the bet she decides to turn him down. He is most insistent as he becomes interested in her when he gets to know her better and Laurel has to find new ways to discourage him and fight her emotions at the same time. There is also at least one person trying to ruin Laurel so they both have to find the vilain before they get together.<br />I found his antics to get closer to her and hers to turn him down were not humorous at all, in fact they were repeating the same things over and over. I also didn't feel close to the characters at any time, they had no depth at all. The whole story was boring, no witty dialogues, no imagination and the vilain was obvious for anyone to find out. In fact, I stopped reading it for a month or so and got back to finish it when I run out of books. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're desperate to read something and you have no alternative. This is my first and last book of Victoria Malvey. I ordered some new books from Kleypas a while ago and they kept me inside my home the whole weekend. If you want something lighter though try Julia Quinn.	2002-08-02

I just finished reading one of the best books I've read this year and probably one that deserves a place in my all time top 5 list! Lately I read several romance books, all of them nice but nothing to rave about. Well, this is cartainly not thie case with the Bride Thief. Thanks to Jaquie d'Allessandro, I spend a most delightful weekend (and came to work after only 5 hours of sleep, since I couldn't out it down)! I've read \\"Whirlwind wedding\\" and \\"Red roses mean love\\" and liked her style very much, but this time she wrote a novel that could only be described as perfect. What I find most amazing about her writing style, is her ability to blend humorous, lighthearted scenes with heartwrenching ones with extreme efficiency, making you pass from laughter to tears and vice versa with ease. This is a book that has it all: tenderness, humor, friendship and of course -what most romance readers crave for- Passion. The characters don't stare at each other and find themselves immediately in love or in lust as is the case with many books: their relationship and feelings for each other evolve as they spend more and more time together, until they realize they can't keep their hands to themselves and get caught in a very compromising situation. The story is fast paced, humorous, witty, the heroine lovely (who else can write a book about a 26 year old, average looking bookworm with spectacles and make the reader actually believe she is desirable???) and the hero is to die for!!!<br />Do yourself a favor and buy this book as soon as possible. You certainly won't regret it! At the least, you'll have an entertaining evening. But what I think, is that you'll find a new keeper. If you haven't read other books by Jaquie d'Alessandro this is definately the place to start.	2002-06-25

I just finished this book, after staying up until 2:30 last night and had to get up at 7:30 to go to work! As it's obvious I couldn't let it down. This book is one of the best I've read this year and I've read a lot, believe me! Perfectly balanced, the first part where Madeline tries to seduce the famous actor is funny, heart warming, tender and makes you laugh with Logan Scott's attempts to avoid her. The second part is much more serious, dealing with the problems that these two people face. It's a very rare case (for me at least) to see that the two heroes love each other but also understand their reasons for staying away of each other. Usually, most writers fail to make the reason that keeps the heroes apart believable, that reason being almost always some misunderstaning. The whole book is very carefully written, always making the reader understand why the heroes act the way the do, feel the way the do and thus feel close to them. All in all, a very heart warming, touching book with less than flowless heroes that you come to love from page one. Highly recommended!	2002-03-26

I read \\"The more I see you\\" by Lynn Kurland first and I was impressed. The book was excellent, humorous, sweet, romantic... it was perfect. I thought I had found an author to rival my favorite Jude Deveraux. So, I decided to buy another book of hers, and what could be best than \\"Stardusts of Yesterday\\" that has the most amazing reviews and book prizes?<br />Please, allow me to say I was sorely disappointed. It was perhaps, as the book critics said, a very good debut. It certainly shows that the author has possilities, good ideas and a very good writing style. So, you probably wonder, why did you rate it with only 3 stars? Well, the first half of the book was very very good indeed, almost perfect. I will agree with another user that the way her \\"loving\\" staff left her was unbelievable to say the least, but at least it saved us a lot of introduction pages before the story really began. When Genevieve meets her ghost and gets to know him better it's sweet, tender, humorous sometimes, a real page turner. But after the ghost becomes corporeal the story keeps falling and losing its interest with every page. Of course, we all have realized who the vilain is, so there's no interest there (not that I always want mystery in my romances, but it could keep this story going a bit more...). Also, I found her fear of making love to the man she loves a bit too much. Being 30 years old means that you've learned some thing in life -even if you haven't tried them yourself- unlike 16 years old girls, such as making love for the first time won't kill you from pain. Anyway in my opinion, the ghost became real, they slept together, end of story. Instead for over 100 pages, we get to read the same dialogs: \\"I love you\\", \\"I love you more\\", \\"I love you too\\", \\"I love you more than life\\", \\"I'll love you all my life\\" and so on...<br />I consider myself a romantic person, I've read almost 100 historical romance books and loved most of them, but I found this almost nauseating... Ok, we got the idea, they are in love. What else now? I kept turning the pages waiting for something new to happen, instead found myself reading again and again how good Kendrick was at making milkshakes (he must have made over 10 in the whole book) and how wonderful peanutbutter and chocolate chips taste.<br />At least, after reading \\"The more I see you\\", it was obvious that the author has talent and certainly improves over time. I already have ordered 2 more of her books and I believe I'll enjoy them. Now, if you like this kind of romances: sweet, pink, cinderella stories and are satisfied reading about the heroes just speak love words to each other over and over again this is the book for you. To me, it seems that this book is not for anyone over 20 years old. Or you could read the first part, where Kendrick was a ghost and throw it out of the window after you finsh it.they are in love.

I love the feeling that once has while reading the book, that the two heroes are really in love and care for each other... it's not just physical attraction for the two of them, but real love. The way the Dragon came back to save her from the wild croud while she stayed back to protect him is so tender. And the fact that she is not a beauty makes it even more heart warming.<br />Sexual attraction was there, love too... what more can someone ask from a romance book?	2001-12-21

She is along with Jude Deveraux and Julia London my favorite authors. I rated every book I've read from her till now with 5 stars, since they were all brilliant. This one, good as it was -4 stars is still a very good rating- was lacking something in plot.<br />Jennifer and Royce are met under very bad circumstances: they are English and Scot, sworn enemies. But when Jenny is captured by Royce, living with him she starts to see another view of him, that of a very handsome, generous and attractive man. He too, is attracted to her mainly by her courage - to stand up to him- and her soft heart. Jennifer's loyalty though, lies firstly to her family, so when the first chance appears she escapes from him, thus making him the laughing stock of all England and Scotland. Royce feels betrayed by her, since he has reasons to believe that all the tenderness and attraction she showed to him, only served her purpose to get free. Jennifer on the other hand, is told that he called her a (...) in front of everyone. So when the king orders the two of them to get married, they both agree to do so with reluctance.<br />At this point of the story, I felt the plot weakening. How this fierce hate they felt for each other turns to tenderness and forgiveness so soon, is something I felt difficult to believe. Also, the story starts to loose its pace, and at some point I was very tempted to skip a few pages and see what happens next... Thankfully this didn't last long and soon I was once again drown to the story which came to a very very interesting ending.<br />The book in general is great though, her writing style uncoparable as usual and you definately won't regret reading it. But, since I have come to expect more that \\"just good\\" from Mrs McNaught, I couldn't rate it with 5 starts as I did with her other novels (Whitney my love, almost heaven, once and always, something wonderful).	2001-11-07

After reading many books describing either the &quot;ton&quot; or the medieval scottish highlands, I found this book to be a nice and very refreshing interlude. It is very fresh, well written and it certainly makes me want to read the rest of the series.<br />Deborah is a very well developed character and so is Tom. It's wonderful to see how they both change (especially Deborah) after living together for so long in Tom's cabin. The descriptions of the island are very enticing, and you can't help but want to go and visit it! Also, all the inhabitants of the little village, take part in the story, they're more than the usual background you see on romance books.<br />Tom is caring, gentle, considerate and Deborah grows up to become a woman instead of the girl she was at the beggining of the story. Respect grows slowly between them which slowly becomes strong love. And the scenes shere they live alone in the island, getting closer to each other are great...<br />This book is definately a must read and I can't wait to read the stories of Deborah's friends!	2001-09-10

I read the &quot;Sherbrooke Bride&quot; and I'm looking forward to read more books from Catherine Coulter. I agree with a reviewer that wrote that this isn't earth-shattering literature, but it's a trully enjoyable read, fast-pacing, funny and with witty dialogues. Of course Douglas may sound as a beast at the beginning, but he's so outrageous that the whole affair seems hilarious. It is a fun read after all and not Dickens.<br />Alexandra is a great heroine, loving him since a child and willing to forgive his mistreating her since she realizes that he feels trapped in their marriage. I like it when one of the heroes can see thgrough the other's point of view and not stick to their own beliefs and sentiments.<br />The book is a most enjoyable read, one you never want to end and one I'm certainly going to read again!!!

I read the reviews about the book and considering that it was in the bestsellers list for historical romance last year, I decided to give it a try.<br />Well, the first part of the book was not bad. In fact it had some witty dialogues and the characters were well developed, though it certainly wasn't up to what I expected (that's why I didn't rate it with 1 star). I know romance books are not supposed to be quantum physics but this? From the moment Lucien proposed her to marry him, the scenario started to fall apart. Every 10 pages the heroine would change her reasons for not marrying him. I'll just refer some of them: she wanted her independance, she believed he didn't love her, she owed it to her parents(!!!), she didn't want the scandals about her affecting him, she believed he was doing it to gain money and titles... For god's sake! It seems to me that the book was supposed to have ended there, except that the pages the writer had promised to complete were more so she kept writing and finding ways to keep it going in order to meet the editor's requirements! The last 100 pages were perhaps the worst I've read in a book.<br />Poor Lucien... I actually felt pity for him: he asked her to marry him almost 10 times and he was turned down all of them after doing everything in his power to help her reputation with the scandals that surrounded her, to get her father's paintings she had sold, to make up with her uncle and she kept on believing he did all these for himself??? Please, if she doesn't want to marry, let her be! The girl is the most ungrateful, stubborn and selfish I've read about. Save your time and read another book by Judith McNaught, Jude Deveraux or Julia London.	2001-09-10

And certainly forget the english ton, ballrooms, etc: the story takes place in a small english village -or to be more specific inside Nicholas house- and in a imaginary land, the home place of Nicholas.<br />It was nice and interesting, though a little too long I think and I would not recommend it to those looking for a light afternoon read.	2001-09-10

It is very well written, the plot is good and not very unrealistic and combines the mystery well with the romance. Eleanor is a nice heroine with much more brains than the usual romance heroine. I like the fact that they both accept from the beggining that what's done is done and married willingly or not, they should try to make the best out of it. Also there is deep respect and caring for each other, which doesn't take long to turn into love. The fact that Nicholas was actually sleeping with another woman during their marriage though, wasn't very much to my liking and I would prefer Jo Beverly had found a way to avoid it.<br />All in all it was a nice book, not one with great passion and heartbreaking scenes, but a good read with sensible heroes, and interesting plot. I recommend this to fans of historical romance but not to someone new on the field: there are much better books to start from (try Judith McNaught for example). I will certainly read more books of the same author myself.	2001-09-10
US	51258055	RIX3QGL6DP1Y2	0440226325	682784432	Wicked Angel	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Another wonderful book by Julia London	I have already read devil's love, the dangerous gentleman (which I consider her best novel), the wicked angel and I'm currently reading the ruthless charmer. I have to say that Julia London is a terrific writer that never lets me down. I compare her to my favorite authors Judith McNaught and Jude Deveraux.<br />I will agree with another reviewer that said her books are perhaps too dramatic, but that's what I like in a book: passionate love stories with the heroes facing many obstacles to achieve happiness. If that's what you like too go ahead and buy all her of books, they're great.<br />In wicked angel, Laurene and Alex meet at Laurene's country house without knowning each other's identities and fall in love. Thet will meet later in London, where she will find out that he is a duke and is engaged to be married soon. Despite this, they both can't deny their attraction to each other and they will be seen in public in a compromising position. Alex will have to decide whether he will go on with his engagement as planned or break it and claim Laurene. The book doesn't end here though as will find out of you read it as more decisions have to be made- which I'm not going to reveal now!<br />All the characters of the book are great, especially Alex!, the story is very well written and has a very funny beggining to balance with the dramatic ending. I strongly suggest you read this and all of Julia Lonodn's books as soon as possible!	2001-09-10

I expected something great, a book that would be close to Whitney my love and Knight in shining armor. As a result I was disappointed, not because it was a bad book but because it doesn't have that &quot;something&quot;, the special magic that will make it a REALLY FANTASTIC book. Certainly not a waste of time or money, but if you're just starting on historical romance, look out for something else first... and don't get your expectations too high.	2001-01-17

This is the first Julia London book I read and I'm determined to buy any other book of hers I can get my eyes on. The plot is quick, very very interesting, the dialogues witty, the characters very well developed.<br />Lillie makes all sorts of things to attract his attention during the daytime. In the night he is a wonderful lover, but during the day he completely ignores her.  Adrian certainly has good reason to avoid getting very intimate with anyone, after his father's behavior and the killing of his cousin. Adrian, though a rake, is adorable, especially after the accident he has. He married her for revenge against his brother. The simple, timid country girl proved a real surprise in their wedding night. But he is determined not to feel anything for anyone again in his life. So Lillie starts making all sorts of extreme things to provoke some feeling inside him, even if that feeling is anger! Adrian slowly starts to notice his wife and finds out she's not as simpleton or as demure as he thought. After some time he realizes that he cares for her and wants to tell that to her, but everything goes wrong. Adrian has a terrible accident that makes him even more distant than before. But in this time of need she stands beside him, despite his angry words to her. But they have to fight all the lies that are thrown between them until they realize, what the reader already knows, that they are made for each other.<br />I stayed up until late reading this book wanting to find out how it ends and at the same time, wishing it wouldn't end. I'm looking forward to read about the two other rogues, especially Arthur. I am only sorry I haven't found Julia London earlier. I think of her at the same level with Jude Deveraux and Judith McNaught, my favorite authors. If you haven't read them, do it now!	2000-10-09
US	51258055	R24AYLHYV0HFZI	055357521X	704749584	Merely Married	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A most enjoyable read!	I highly recommend this book to anyone. It's a wonderful book which kept me laughing all the way through (ok, except near the ending). I finished it in an afternoon and looking forward to re-reading it again. The dialogues are witty and really funny and they don't depend on the stupideness of the naive/innocent heroine to make the reader laugh. Instead, Leah is a very clever woman and Adrian is wonderful. The story goes on without delay, without 10-pages dialogues, and with great humor.  A very nice, entertaining book for anyone to read which will lighten up your day!	2000-10-02
US	51258055	R3F05MD6Q3SED9	0671737791	378094364	The Bride	Books	2	8	18	N	N	A big disappointment	I have read books of Judith McNaught and Jude Deveraux and loved them. I noticed a lot of readers mentioning julie Garwood and decided to give it a try. I could not believe that the book I am currently reading -The Bride- is considered such an awsome book from so many readers. Am I the only one having problem with Jamie? The girl is the embodiness of stupidity. How can a girl that looked after her family for years be so silly and jump to  ridiculous conclusions where her husbant is concerned? I am in the middle of the book and I don't think I'll have the courage to finish it. Alec is ok, but Jamie is the worst heroine I've met in a book. Extremely clever in everything and exrtemely &quot;naive&quot; when it comes to understanding her husbant? Something does not fit right here...	2000-10-02

Vampire Lestat is a fabulous book, which I've read 3 or 4 times. It's a  book that you can't put down until you've finished it and when you do  finish it, you want to read the next of the chronicles... The queen of the  damned, the third of the series, id a very nice book too, I highly recomend  it, but after that they keep getting worse and worse... But the first three  books are absolutely great, don't miss them.	2000-08-18

Too bad the next vampire chronicles didn't come near them. A little more  romantic that the previous two, but certainly a worth reading one. I highly  suggest reading the first 3 of the vampire chronicles, but I wouldn't  recommend any of the next... I would also suggest reading the  &quot;mummy&quot; too, a very nice book indeed.	2000-08-18
US	51258055	R2TWU1LQ56O3WS	0671705091	386088520	A Knight in Shining Armor	Books	5	2	3	N	N	One of the best romance books I've read!	This book is marvelous! It's a story of time travel (it may sound strange at first, but you'll love the idea as you read on) and love between two souls that were meant to be together.  Nicholas is the man every woman  dreams: caring, witty, humorous, generous, romantic and handsome, a true  knight in shining armor. He is my favorite hero of all romance books I've  read and surely you'll love him too. Dougless appears  very immature and  lacking confidence at the begining, but becomes very brave and strong as  the story develops, without ever losing her sensitivity or femininity.  The  author manages to write a love story that will stay in your heart long  after you've read the book, which you will no doubt re-read later. It's a  must have book for lovers of historical romance and romance generally.	2000-07-31
US	51258055	R3RHO124EG8BMA	067174383X	369934628	The Taming	Books	5	1	2	N	N	I loved it!	This was the first book I read from Jude Deveraux and I loved it! I bought some more books of hers later, some were good some not so good, but this one has a special place in my heart. I read it over and over and I never  get bored of it. It's very interesting to see tenderness and love  developing in such a hard man, and I think Liana's character, as presented  by the author, totally justifies this change in Rogan. For me it's a must  have for funs of romanting literature.	2000-07-28
US	51258055	R2N3T6BLWPH7HE	0671739751	335874452	Velvet Song	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Rather disappointing book I would say...	It was not that bad, but I have read 2 or 3 books of Jude Deveraux and loved them so I expected this to be a very good book too. Unfortunately, it was just an average book, good to read and pass your free time, but nothing  to remember about it after it's finished. Alyx's transformation to a boy,  ends very early and the only thing that keeps the story going after that,  is Raine's jealousy (a very common theme). I loved  the Taming and the  Knight in Shining Armor, and this book had nothing to do with them. I would  suggest readers to try other books of Jude Deveraux and forget this one....	2000-07-28
