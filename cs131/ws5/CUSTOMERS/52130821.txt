US	52130821	R2SBP7R5VY2I5W	0965469417	23096094	Brigid's Charge	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Interesting read about frontier life	I was originally drawn to this book because of the goddess lore.  I enjoyed reading about Deborah and her trip from England to the New World and was intrigued by the Quakers and the hardships of living in a colony.  It was interesting to see Deborah think about having another life for herself other than wife and mother.  Although the story is plainly told, Deborah had a complexity to her.<br />What I liked least about the book was, unfortunately, the goddess lore.  I found it to be forced and New-Agey.  It just did not ring true for me.  I think the story would have been better served by not forcing the Old Religion into the plot and kept to the plight of this woman trying to find her self in a new world and having her livelyhood taken away from her.<br />It also seemed like the ending was a bit over the top.  It was exciting but after I read it, it felt like sensationalism.  I won't give it away but suffice to say I wish the book concluded with a bit more restraint.<br />Authors like Marion Zimmer Bradley and Rosalind Miles do a very good job of intergrating goddess lore into their stories.  I would recommend this book if you are interested in women of spirit and tales of the frontier.	2003-09-23

Based on her comments in the Introduction and concluding paragraphs of this book, I am quite sure that Wilde would not consider herself a feminist.  While I do not consider myself a feminist, I definitely bristled at her clear statements on how men and Christianity taking over female-centered societies have advanced civilization.  Says who?  She must live in a Eutopian bubble not to see the inequality around her.  Unfortunately, we will never know otherwise.<br />With that said, I did appreciate the book.  Wilde takes us with her to various Near and Middle Eastern countries to search for the Amazons.  There is also some great information on Goddess-centered and therefore female-centered societies.  The book is clearly written and is not sentimental.  Wilde does not bash males or push to give females more of a place of power than she can prove.<br />What does ruin it for me are the comments about how Christianity and men have advanced civilization and made the world a better place.  I consider myself her target audience and wish that even if she does feel this, she kept it to herself because it sticks in my mind much more than all of the research and travel she embarked on to bring the Amazons to life.	2003-08-30

I won't go into the details of the book since so many others have.  Suffice to say that the story is fantastic (in all senses of the word), and Moore clearly spent a lot of time researching for the tale.  I think it is an entertaining story for both Christians and non-Christians.  Moore is respectful of Joshua while being true to his style - Biff makes an excellent fall guy.

Practical Demonkeeping is very funny but has a lot of characters to keep track of.  I loved all of the characters but felt that the story was truncated by them and wrapped up too quickly.  I would have made the ending a bit longer.  Other than that, it is still a great read. Moore's books are like eating chips - after reading one, you will have to consume them all.	2003-02-16

I read this book in a day. While the humor is sexually charged, I never found it offensive or vulgar.  What I love about Moore is that he constantly catches me off guard with his storytelling.  You can clearly see his evolution from Practical Demonkeeping to Lust Lizard.  He makes you care about his characters and sucks you into their lives without sacrificing the plot.  You will never look at seafood the same way again.	2003-02-16

The main portion of this book notes various deities' festival days throughout the calendar year.  The back of the book has correspondence tables and examples of rituals for the 8 sabbats.  What I really liked were the mini rituals/spells given for some of the festival days.  Lady Sabrina's workings are inventive and crafty.  The only oddity are the season/element correspondences on the front cover which don't match her correspondence tables, but I don't know how much control authors have over their book covers. Good reference book.	2003-01-09

While I thought the book was overlong and perhaps a bit too poetic for my taste, what I liked about it was that it made me think about the rituals I was putting together.  I was disappointed that Orr's rituals were not very interesting but she did give me a lot to think about, especially in the beginning chapters.  I would suggest reading the first few chapters and then stopping before the rituals (which tends to be the opposite thing to do for most magic books!). Not a must-buy but is worth a read.	2002-12-23

This packet comes with a small goddess statue that acts as an incense burner, 4 sticks of incense, and a very thick, small book of goddess affirmations - heavy on the Native American and more obscure goddesses.  The box also turns into an altar. I have always been a big fan on Nancy Blair and really like this concept.<br />My only bias is that because it is a 365 day book of goddess, I wish all the major goddesses were representated.  I agree that mentioning obscure goddess is important, but I think representing the core group is also valid.  I would recommend this set to anyone.	2002-07-30

While I thought this was fairly well written as magick books go, Ostara did not inspire me.  Granted, the history of this sabbat may hard topic to write about.  What I really found lacking was the ritual / spell aspects.  It was just a rehashing of correspondence tables that we have seen many times before.  McCoy does not give us a real, solid ritual to work off of.  I read through the book once and went through it about half a dozen times looking for something to inspire me but came up short.  It is not awful, just not that great.	2002-03-24

However, I made the mistake of reading this book right after reading &quot;How to be a Wicked Witch&quot;.  I felt like I was reading the same book twice.  The information is obviously slightly different but the formula is the same.  If you are new to Telesco, I would definitely recommend this book because she is a lot of fun to read with great ideas.  If you have many of her other books, you might want to wait to see if her next offering does not perhaps feel like more of the same. (It kills me to say this!)	2002-03-24

The introductory information seemed a stretch but the rituals are really outstanding. I was tremendously inspired by their sabbat and Brigit celebrations.  It made me rethink my entire festival.  They clearly know how to craft a ritual. Recommended!	2002-03-24

I was very wrong.  This is the best book I have ever read on the solstice.  It tells of celebrating Yule before Christianity abducted it.  &quot;The Winter Solstice&quot; has the look of an arty, coffee table book but it is definitely worth the read.  It offers a couple of small rituals and some great phrases for ceremonies.  It is more of a scholary history than a magickal book.  I cannot wait to read it again next December to get me in the Yule spirit!	2002-03-24

The bulk of the book touches lightly on the celebrations throughout the world.  It is interesting, if not a little dry. The remaining chapters suggest ways in which people can celebrate on their own.<br />This is a pagan-friendly book.  I was disappointed, however, because I thought I was purchasing a book which focussed mainly on how to celebrate rather than a historical book.  The title and cover were misleading to me.  I think it should have been named &quot;Ancient Solstice Celebrations&quot; instead.<br />The book is well written and the information is obscure.  I would recommend for historical background rather than celebration ideas.	2002-03-24

Morrison clearly has an affection for this holiday.  However, the beginning history of this book has very little to do with Yule.  It seems like more of a justification of pagans celebrating Christmas without Christ.  And her 'history' is very suspect - as in referring to the Greek world as Persia. I think there is a danger of doing most of your research off of the internet.<br />I would recommend this book for the ritual / spells.  Morrison can turn a magikal phrase and I was inspired by what she had to offer. To get the most out of this book, skip the beginning fluff and go right to the meat.  If you really want a book on Yule, read &quot;The Winter Solstice&quot; by John Matthews.  Now that is a pagan book on this great holiday.	2002-03-24

I think that books like this are vital and need to be written.  I love stories of the goddess and fairy tales in general.  When they miss their mark, however, it is very disappointing.<br />The premise is excellent - retellings and new stories of the goddess prefaced with an introduction to each story.  While there are one or two gems, most of the stories are either just fair or feel incomplete.  All of the stories are very short - just a few pages each - some only two pages.  Those stories feel like they are missing a bridge or link to what the author is trying to convey.  Some of the stories do not follow conventional mythology (like referring to Horus as Osiris) and that can be very confusing if you have a strong background in mythology.  The stories that worked best for me were the ones where I was not familiar with the goddess or culture.<br />The stories were meant to be read aloud.  I think they lose something in simply reading them.  It would be interesting if the author put out an audio tape and presented her work as it was meant to be enjoyed.	2002-02-15

To me, it seemed as though he was writing to a female audience.  This book is also good for pagans or non-pagans.  Pond goes through all of the chakras and gives some meditations at the end.  I found the chapters on the sixth and particularly the seventh chakras to be a bit confusing but perhaps that is the point - that they are hard to commit to paper.<br />The only criticism I have is that I wish there were more meditations.  Other than that, I recommend purchasing for beginner / intermediate students	2002-01-11

With one eye on the 'three-fold law,' this book lightheartedly illustrates ways of practicing gray magic.  The workings are highly creative and range from divination, spells, charms &amp; amulets, and kitchen witchery among others. With this book, every single act can be turned into a magical moment.  What is 'wicked' about the book is its humor.  The charm adapted from Albertus Magnus is a riot.<br />Rather than repeating detailed correspondence charts, the author references other magical books with more detailed entries.  What makes this book special is the sheer inventiveness of what can be considered a magical tool. &quot;The Wicked Witch's Rules&quot; are also important to take into consideration as we walk in our pointy shoes.  This is beautiful, pure, earth magic at its best.	2001-11-09

Without repeating the plot or giving away any spoilers, I loved the reason behind all of the odd happenings in Crane's View.  The author does not wrap up the story in a bow.  There are questions posed that remain unanswered - as well they should.  That is the magic of the story.  While there is no real sex in the book, the story has a sexuality to it - we can identify with Frannie McCabe because he thinks as everyman and lives as everyman.  We should all get the opportunities that he has been given.  I read the book in 2 days - I just couldn't put it down.	2001-11-07

While I thought the meditations were a bit too structured and guided, I appreciated the creativity behind them.  It did surprise me, however, that the suggestion was placed where a goddess may refuse you during the meditation.  I think planting that idea in someone's head is defeating the purpose of the working.  It would have been better to say &quot;how does the goddess respond to you&quot; instead of going into the meditation worry if the goddess is going to refuse you.  Also, there was little mention of thanking that goddess for her gifts/audience.<br />I thought the weakness of the book was in the Mundane Archetypes.  For the most part, it gave the impression that the goddess are petty and the information did not necessarily follow the mythology presented earlier in the chapter - especially for Artemis (orgies?!).  The book &quot;Goddesses in Everywoman&quot; by Jean Shinoda Bolen is a much better resources for this type of information. I think the author would have been better served to leave out these sections and maybe focussed more on the Tarot aspects.<br />I would recommend this book for the ritual baths and meditations (with less structure).  I would not turn to it as a resource for goddess information. However, I was inspired to check out the author's bibliography to see where she got her background information.	2001-11-07

We are transformed as we follow Rose through her betrayal and redemption.  I think I would have been overwhelmed reading this if I was a beginner because like the fairy tale, it assumes a spiritual life and previous magical experience would be very helpful. There is no hocus-pocus in this book. Meditiation is stressed and spells are practically non existent.  This is real magic.  The connection to divinity is profound.<br />The book is written in a feminine voice. The authors explain that it is not only to try to balance all of the books that are written in a male voice but also to avoid the constant repetition of god and goddess and he and she.  It was refreshing to read a book written in this light.  This book does not male bash or Christian bash, and I was also grateful for that as well.<br />I would go through this book line by line if I was either starting a group or working in one currently.  While you can be a solitary and get a lot out of this book, I think a newbie solitary would have a hard time at first.  Towards the end of the book, the authors drop solitary references and recommend ways to draw people of like mind into your life.<br />There is a lot of political activism and community spirit in this book.  The authors recognize that we do not live in a vacuum and it is all well and good to do spells and prayers for the Earth but real, concrete involvement is really what's going to save the planet and our souls.<br />The writing is superb.  Read this and be transformed.	2001-10-31

The meat of the book is only 173 pages for 14 authors.  There were no real glimmers of insight and when there were, there was no detail to back them up.  I wish the questions posed to the authors were a little better thought out and that the authors took time to illustrate what they do magically in their daily lives and how they combat discrimination.  Everything else is just fluff - knowing glances and histories full of royalty and generals as well has statements that they are the magic.  If you are going to write books to try to reach people, certainly there is more to your daily lives than that!  Also, there is no insight into any of the authors' creative processes.<br />That said, I am glad that I read the book.  Some of the author responses are definitely worthwhile and prompted me to read some people I had been leery about before.  Unfortunately, the book just has a thrown together feel - It could have been a bit longer and better thought out (or perhaps the selected authors could have made their responses a little better).  Generally, I think I would have been better served to buy a book by any one of these authors.<br />This book would be good for people who collect books by particular writers or to get a very small insight into the leaders of the pagan community.  I just think it was a missed opportunity.  I wish I had a chance to ask the questions!	2001-10-31

I really enjoyed this book.  I own a lot of spell books and what separates this from all the others is its simplicity.  Dolnick tells you why you are doing the spell and exactly how and when to do it.  The only thing I found missing was a further explanation as to why particular flowers or herbs were used and if we could substitute (i.e., some flowers are expensive and not always in season).  There is little-to-no spiritual reference in this book so you do not have to be Wiccan or Pagan to appreciate it (Wiccans/Pagans may miss the witchy atmosphere as I did at first); Dolnick mainly relies on astrological information and herb/color lore - again, without much explanation (my opinion, the only failing of the book).  If you like your spells with a little more flexibility, you may feel a bit constrained. I like that there are spells to work during the waxing and waning moons and that prosperity can be about letting go of fear as well as drawing opportunities. I am very glad that I purchased this book.	2001-08-05

I am a big fan of Stephen Fry's work, and he certainly delivers in this book.  It is both touching and scandalous.  I loved it!	2000-07-12

The book discusses the differences and similarities between the Orisha and provides prayers and offering suggestions.  It would be helpful to those  either just getting started or as a quick reference for the inititated.	2000-03-26

The type is hard to read and the illustrations are small.  I would only recommend purchasing this book if you collect books on witches and want to add it to your collection.  You will not get anything else from it.	2000-02-19

While it does have some interesting Wiccan references, it is clear that it is not for instruction, but for novelty purposes.  As a  witch, I think it is a fun book to have with wonderful illustrations.	2000-02-19

I was less enchanted, however, with the book.  I did not find the questionnaire very helful or entertaining.  But, the information on the Goddesses was useful and  thoughtful.  I would definitely recommend to anyone who loves Goddess  images.	2000-02-06

It is ripe with information on the Goddesses, including mythology, invocations, and rituals.  Highly recommended!	2000-02-06

Short on words; long on beautiful photographs.  The only drawback is the size.  The book is so well done that I wish it was larger!	2000-02-06

Beautiful artwork and a well-written, thoughtful companion book makes this a perfect combination.  I can't believe I almost passed it up!  Definitely a must-have for Goddess-worshippers and people interested in Mythology	2000-02-06

I read many of the reviews before I purchased the book but have decided to return the book because you do need the supplements to make the diet work.  I'd say having 3 shakes a day for 12 weeks is a big part of the program!  Also, this is not a diet for vegetarians.	2000-01-21

I have been reading it to him since he was about 1 year old (he is  2 1/2 now).  We read it over and over and pick out all the little surprises in the artwork.  He even &quot;helps&quot; me read it.  We are on our second copy!!	1999-10-22

I have always felt that Terry Pratchett was at his best writing about the witches. They seem to be written with such pleasure. In Carpe Jugulium, the side plots are great and the ending was a surprise. I read the last page and started all over again. Thank you, Terry!	1999-09-27
