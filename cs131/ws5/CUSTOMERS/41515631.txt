That being said, for any Cardinals fan this is a good book.  Get yourself a copy!  It's great to read.  There a great insights and profiles of the team.  For anyone with a desire to see a little further behind the scenes of MLB, this is also a good book.  There is however nothing new here.  Mr. Bissinger states at the begining that this book is sort of the answer to Michael Lewis' \\"Moneyball\\".  I don't see that. I suggest reading them both. \\"3 Nights in August\\" and \\"Moneyball\\"  both shed light on baseball and human nature and the fundamentals of success.	2005-05-04

Mr. Donald has made a very to the point work without speculation and over examination.  It is simply Lincoln, who comes across as simple and well meaning. This is not the Lincoln of high rhetoric grandly leading the country through a difficult time.  Donald's Mr. Lincoln comes across as a man of great potential and high purpose who struggled daily with the complex world around him.  You feel his frustrations and his troubles. This is one book that really demonstrates that history does not just happen.  The outcomes are not known.  The struggles are real.  Lincoln's struggles are real.  Just a wonderful read!!	2004-08-18

The amount of spin that goes on in today's public life is astounding.  Spin has always been there to one extent or another, but the amount of time expended on it from both sides boggles the mind.     Stephanopoulos gives a good account of the more liberal side of the Clinton story.  He is often too critical of the President assuming that any move to the political center was a sell out for the sake of polls and not inspired by conviction.  Clinton was elected and for several years had preached the gospel of pragmatism; activist government through practical means. He was a prophet of moving the Democratic Party closer to the political center. Above all he wanted to get things done. His is an honest accounting of a flawed person with great potential, and the frustrations of what might have been. Growing up just across the Arkansas state line in Missouri, I watched Clinton's rise on the local news since the early 80s.  His convictions are very real and his political skills are amazing.  His goal is to make progress and get things done.    This is a really good read however.  I couldn't put the book down.  Balance it with other views of the Clinton White House, but definately include it if you want to see things from all sides.	2004-08-17

This is the perfect book for those who want a refresher from their principles of management class in business school or for those who never had one. The opening belongs, as one would expect, to Frederick W. Taylor and surprisingly Elihu Root.  From there it is simply the progression of managment thought over the course of the twentieth century. Going by decade Crainer offers up the trend of managment theory and practice with insights from the important thinkers and practitioners of the times.  At the end of each chapter there is a brief timeline as well as a sample of the companies on the Dow at that time and various bits of information that provide the opportunity for further study.  All in all this is a wonderful book!!	2004-08-16

There are wonderful historcal explanations of the rise of socialism in the west and communism in the east as well as the two grand economic schools in the west which were the products of John Maynard Keynes and Frederich Von Hayek. From this point the authors go on to give some form and explanation of globalization and the benefits and negative fallouts that are associated with it. <br /> <br />As a whole the book is absolutely worth reading, however keep in mind that the writers develope a certain point of view. The reader is left with the impression that after the free market revolutions of the 1980s Keynes was put to flight and it is obvious that what we need are even more open markets and that this is the solution to all the world's problems.  Keep in mind that there are some goods and services that the market simply cannot deliver and like most cycles in history this debate is probably not settled. <br /> <br />As for their explanations on globalization they are pretty much on the mark.  Obviously free markets are what is needed in most parts of the world and the move towards them will absolutely make the world a better place in the LONG run, but maybe a much less agreeable place in the short. <br /> <br />There are numerous supplements that I would recommend with this book, but I won't list them here.  Make this a part of your journey to understand the wider world, but do not make the mistake of thinking this is the final answer.  There is much more to learn and understand than this book offers.  Great place to start however.	2004-08-09

It's all too complex to go into in this small space, but suffice it to say that any understanding of the modern world that has come into view after the fall of communism must start with the peace that was negotiated after the First World War. The world was carved up in many ways and was held together by dictators and communism for the next seventy years. For those particularly interested in the Middle East you should also consult David Fromkin's &quot;A Peace to End All Peace&quot; which gives a more in depth account of the fall of the Ottoman Empire.       This work is well written and balanced and the character studies are wonderful. This is first rate narrative history!	2004-08-04

His father was a powerful man by local standards who owned a large farm which was cropped on shares by the poor blacks of the area. Mama was a nurse and it is clear that she was very much admired by her children. Carter gives an unvarnished account of life in south Georgia in the 20s and 30s.  There are vivid accounts of Mama, Daddy, Uncle Buddy, and the farmers who sharecropped on the Carter's land and who became close friends.  The social ways of the rural south are written about and Carter shows that it was a place where things are not always what they seem and good church going Baptists can look the other way when it meets their needs.  This is a strong work, well written and a joy to read.	2004-07-28

Although Taylor's works focus on the \\"society\\" of Nashville and Memphis for the most part and not the agrarians of the rural south, his themes are much the same. The breaking down of old loyalties, manners, faiths, and relationships by the pluralisms of modern life.      A Summons To Memphis has already been described by other reviewers and I'll leave that as it is. Taylor's fiction is a much wider target than the simple story of Phillip Carver and his transplanted family in Memphis. By all means read this book and spend some time with Taylor's masterful short stories as well.	2004-07-28

Tony Earley's essay, Letter from Sister: What We Learned at the P.O., which concerns Eudora Welty's great short story, is probably the best thing in the book.

Schoolcraft's jouney begins at Potosi, Missouri on November 5, 1818 and proceeds southwest to the Arkansas border along the North Fork River.  From there he travels northwest towards modern day Springfield and then back southeast into Arkansas along the White River to Batesville.  From the Batesville area he proceeds northeast back towards Potosi arriving there on February 4, 1819. <br /> <br />Schoolcraft's descriptions of the unsettled land and its native plants and animals are wonderful. Prof. Raferty has added an appendix which provides a day by day account of Schoolcraft's journey and the modern reference points with amazing accuracy. <br /> <br />This is a great book for anyone with an interest in the history and geography of the Ozarks Region.

Prof. Gilmore has done a great job detailing the history of just how people of the turn of the century Ozarks entertained themselves.  Taken mostly from old newspapers and oral histories you get great insight into the box and pie suppers, community picnics, spellings bees, debates, school plays, singing schools, and other gatherings that people used to spice up their isolated rural lives in the rugged Ozarks.  I was amazed at some of the worldly topics that were debated in the schools in the evenings and the pure excitment of packing up the wagon with fried chicken and pies to spend the day at the community picnic.   <br /> <br />This book provides a warm look back at a much simpler time.

I did not grow up in Kentucky in the baby boom generation, but I did grow up in rural southern Missouri just after it, and this story is so very like what I was familiar with. Ms. Mason is of my mother's generation and except for the disfunction there are many similarities between this story and stories my mother has told. My family reminded me of the older Masons and not the disfunctional Lees. The isolation of rural life, but the joy in many ways that come from it. The curiosity of the outside world, but the fear of it. She relates that Clear Springs hadn't changed much since the Civil War and she was correct in that. The world that slowly evolved for most Americans changed before this rural generation's eyes. A Great book!	2004-07-23

This is very much a regional book and will have little interest to anyone who isn't searching for some meaning from the South. It is great reading however.  Although the essays in the book are not connected, the general theme is one of a general distrust of the modern industrial world where people have no connection to place and stable values and ideals. There is a definate feeling of longing for the agrarian South of old that was slowly slipping away at the time. Very interesting.	2004-07-23

As a whole he did a good job however it did go on at length at times after the subject had been explained. This could well be one of those books that would have made a outstanding article in The Atlantic, but was stretched to fill the space of a book.  It is an important subject however and don't shy away from spending the time with this book.	2004-07-20

I pick this book up and read it over and over again.  It's WONDERFUL!  Ms. Welty does a great job explaining her life growing up in Jackson, Mississippi in the first half of the 20th Century and how it influenced her writing.  Her descriptions of her school prinicipal and the town librarian are priceless as are her descriptions of sunday school at the Methodist Church. Originally delivered as a part of the Massey Lectures on American Civilization at Harvard University, she did a wonderful job spinning these into a super little book. After reading the book I had to visit her home in Jackson and see Jefferson Davis School across the street.	2004-07-20

Facinating reading on the evolution of political thought through the last thirty years of the 20th Century. If you have an interest in politics and economics and are the least bit curious about ideas it can't be beat. When you finish you should follow up with &quot;They Only Look Dead&quot; which, sort of, takes up where this book leaves off. Dionne is a great writer and a solid thinker.	2004-07-20

Caro provides a vivid account of the very difficult younger years of Lyndon Johnson. He does not come across as a hero, but you do have admiration for the man even with all of his very human flaws. He was striving and manipulative, but he had a sensitive side to him as well. Johnson is the great paradox of the century in American politics.	2004-07-20

I've read it three times and enjoyed Ms. Cather's outstanding writing, finding something new each time.  This is one of those classic works that every literate person should read in their lifetime. It's a great story of a brave determined girl in Nebraska, but it is Cather's vivid writing that makes the book.	2004-07-16

This is an extremely entertaining book and very well written. The characters are real although sometimes you almost wonder and hope that they aren't. The Civil Wargasm with Robert Lee Hodge is, well, interesting. Each chapter tells the story of a different stop on Horwitz's journey across the south and there are colorful characters at each. It was very hard to put the book down at times and hard to keep reading it at others. I almost put it down for good with the chapter &quot;Dying For Dixie&quot; Sad! I'm glad that I kept with however. It was quite a ride, but well worth it!! Really a good read!!!!!	2004-07-16

Her story of farm and small town life are great, but her descriptions of war and Europe at the end seem almost like a separate story.

Michael Lewis does a great job telling the story of the Oakland A's and just why a team with one of the smallest payrolls in baseball has compiled one of the best records.

Ms. Dalton's work does a great job covering those areas.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone just encountering TR for the first time.  He is absolutely a person that we all need to know.  What a great character!  If it was fiction you might not believe it all.  If  you do know TR's life story already then I would suggest Edmund Morris' work.  By all means however give this book a try.  It's worth your time.	2004-07-14

Albert Castel does a great job keeping up with a long campaign.

What a great waste.  Connelly and McDonough put forth a very solid effort on the battle.  Their preface to the book is actually worth the price of the book itself.  Each man had experience as young men on the battlefields of Tennessee and they do a wonderful job describing how it effected them.  For drama and color, Wiley Sword's work on Franklin is best, but for pure military analysis &quot;Five Tragic Hours&quot; can't be beat.	2004-07-14

Being a native of Southern Missouri and growing up not too many miles from the Pea Ridge Battlefield, I may be biased, but in my opinion this is THE BEST work of Civil War history that I've read!  Shea and Hess do a great job with background on the characters in the book and the descriptions of battle are chilling. Unlike many works on battles and war, &quot;Pea Ridge&quot; gives the full flavor of war. The writers did have the advantage of a perfectly sized battle that made it easier to cover in detail, but I give credit to their wrtiting and research for making this such a great book.  Even if the Trans-Mississippi area of the Civil War is not a great interest to you, I would recommend this book.  It's really that good!!!!!	2004-07-14

I've read it over several times since and each time I enjoy it just as much as the first.  What a great person and what a remarkable life! This is one book that I can't possibly say enough about. IT'S OUTSTANDING!! Mr. McCullough obviously admires his subject, but he is objective and shows Mr. Truman warts and all.  He had very few warts however.  BUY IT and READ IT as soon as you can.

It's a soldier's point of view of all things military.  To fully understand this interesting army you will still need to go to Thomas Connelly's masterful &quot;Army of The Heartland&quot; and &quot;Autumn of Glory&quot;, but start here. If you've already read Connelly then this book is a great compliment to those works.	2004-07-14

If you have a good working knowledge of the characters involved then you won't find anything new here. &quot;1912&quot; serves more as either an introduction to the subject or a refresher.  If you have the time and the interest I would suggest a biography of each of the four main players and possibly one on William Jennings Bryan who was an extremely important player of the era who gets beat up some in this book.	2004-06-25

The author covers a history or flood control on the Mississippi, which might sound dull but is not, as well as some of the very important characters who shaped the history of this very important river in our history. His story of the Percy family and the powers of New Orleans is equally interesting.  The events and stories that lead up to the great event are as interesting as the Great Flood of 1927 itself.

TR had a zest for life that I would have to say is unmatched!  His time in the Badlands, his adventures with the police department in New York City, any part of TR's life is facinating and his zeal for it unmatched.
