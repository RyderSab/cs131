It covers my favorite area on the planet (the Colorado Plateau) and as soon as I heard it was to be published, I decided to hike the section from South Rim to Zion National Park.  With a lot of maps, trails could have been chosen and mistakes would have been made.  This book has cut my planning down to less than half.  The section getting from the Utah border to Highway 9 in Zion is worth the price alone.  I can't wait to squeeze through \\"Fat Man's Misery\\".<br /><br />This book should eliminate the planning mistakes.  I'm sure I'll be able to make enough on my own.  The mileages are essential information and well laid out in the different sections of the book.  Important information such as where not to camp because of crossing private property and specific locations where there is  danger of flash flooding, is vital to the component that needs to right up there with fun: safety.<br /><br />The maps are excellent with the mileages shown on the maps corresponding with the mileages in the mileage portion of each section.  Telling where water can be located and where to cache food for later pickup is equally important.<br /><br />Most of the \\"Trail\\" is non-trailed.  Excellent navigation skills are required for a successful completion of any portion of the Trail.  I would have liked to see some GPS coordinates but most of those I wanted were available on the internet.<br /><br />The book deserves additional credit for not sugar-coating the dangers that one will face on this Trail.  The dangers cannot be overemphasized.  It's not called wilderness for nothing.<br /><br />Mitch and Joe want to bring attention to this wonderful area that seems to increasingly be under attack by those who look only at profit.  To that end, I hope this book will be successful.	2005-03-22

The Trails Illustrated map of the GC includes this area so that if you want to explore anything west of 112 15'W, you'll need to get the TI map.<br /><br />This is a lovely map for the limited area it shows.  If the map included the missing area, the quality of this map would be my choice of the two.  Another unique and nice feature is trail mileages included on many trails.<br /><br />Use area designations are shown which assist in applying for a backcountry camping permit.  I'd have preferred that the designations such as BJ9 and AK9 had color variations to indicate their respective Management Zones such as Primitive and Wild.<br /><br />All in all this is an excellent map subject to above comments and provides a tremendous amount of information.	2005-03-17

His faith is strong and when attacked and nearly dead, waits to hear God's words before dying.  He is judgmental which I don't find endearing regardless of faith or lack thereof.  The only women that are treated kindly are those that are already devout, the rest are confused, jealous, fickle, fornicators or worse.<br />Things move at a slow pace without the unpredictability of everyday  life.  But since there aren't a whole lot of Christian mysteries and I can imagine devout Christians not being happy with some of the debasement of other humans found in so many mysteries these days, this should be just up their alley.	2004-03-08

I didn't find him sufficiently developed.<br />Tom seems to stumble towards a final resolution with regular discussions of his attraction to violence.  The reason for the original crime is pretty much ignored although quite obvious and then dealt with at the end in a somewhat off-handed fashion.<br />The characters were fun but they seemed like part of a formula.  The main character is a smart lawyer who breaks the rules.  Sancho Panza is a 6'6&quot; PI with an ex-stripper girlfriend.  The love interest finds the men's behavior and speech Neanderthalic.  Where have I seen variations of these characters before?<br />Starts out well but just stumbles along to a tidy but less than stunning conclusion.<br />Cotton candy.	2003-11-25

The system requires high maintenance observation (in 1 minute, 5 minute, 15 minute and 60 minute charts in each future discussed) that would require programming assistance in the background.  NB Another reviewer states he has programmed this in ELA & offers his email address.<br />There are many charts which take up half of the book, but since most of the time the chart being referenced in the text is on another page, it's a hassle to jump back and forth.  The writing style could cure insomnia.<br />As in Larry Williams' daytrading book, this book would have benefitted greatly by inclusion of Performance Reports with Profit Factors, ROI, consecutive losers and the like.  In fairness to the author, he provides the results of all trades in a month period for the different time periods (1-minute through 60-minutes) for various futures including the DM.  These could have been enhanced with profit targets, it was surprising to see better than potential $1000+ trades allowed to turn into losers.<br />Once the single system was explained, the various futures could have been presented with 1 time frame Performance Report and the best value, on successive pages.<br />Unfortunately since Barnes limited himself to 1 month of trades, there is insufficient information on those time frames greater than 1 or 5 minute charts, to determine the validity of the system.  One needs a minimum of 30 samples and in many instances there are only 3 trades for the time period presented.<br />Better editing would have enhanced the value of this book in making it more comprehensible and capable of the system being confirmed as being viable.	2003-01-04

The plot set-up and development were very predictable.<br />The story is narrated about three-quarters by Bridgett Logan, a Manhattan private investigator from an Irish-Catholic Bronx background.  She wants to live up to her father's expectations of her when he was alive.  He wanted her to become a cop, she became a junkie.<br />Now recovered and working for people far better than her, she is asked by an old friend from her junk days to help her out of a jam.  The things Bridgett subjects herself to, strains credulity.  The loyalty her friends have for her and what they're willing to expose themselves to, equally strains belief.  She rewards each one, including her nun sister, by repeatedly lying to them.<br />This is my first Attiticus novel.  I found Andrew a much more interesting person than Atticus.<br />Bridgett has few redeeming characteristics except a methodical mind that's willing to risk her life for a friend.  I didn't find her a very believable or likeable character.  The other characters were not developed well enough.  Perhaps I'd have to read previous novels to have a better feel for them.<br />Maybe most of the other reviewers who praised this novel so highly, enjoy stories of the mean streets of addiction depravity, but I prefer to make a better connection with the characters I read about.  They don't have to be necessarily likeable, but they need to be at least interesting.  Bridgett Logan was neither.	2003-01-04

The premise of immortality due to an exotic plant, and the ramifications to the individual and to society as a whole, could have been a classic. Instead it became a TV thriller screenplay. Now, an idea that could have been done so much better in more capable hands, has been for the most part, ruined. The editor should have seen how great the story could have been, but copped out for a commercial success, rather than a contribution to something of thought-provoking literary value.<br />Chris Bacon is in in Papua and is given a plant by a childhood friend who claims to be 123 years old and the plant is the reason. Chris takes it back and somehow works on it at the pharmaceutical company where he is employed, for two years before the company CFO (the initial villain) stumbles on it.<br />In the meantime, Chris discusses with his wife the impact of taking the serum (Elixir) by a human and thgus achieving potntial immortality. His father has lost many of his mental faculties in his early 60s and Chris feels (or imagines) he is experiencing early Alheizmers at age 42. His wife, certainly more level headed, accepts her eventual demise and states \\"Death is what makes us human.\\" This point and her later quote of Wallace Stevens \\"Death is the mother of beauty\\" could have been a recurring theme as the author tries to convince the readers immortality is fun to think about, but we don't want to try it.  Instead the book takes itself too seriously without putting in the effort such a topic deserves.<br />There are a lot of muddled plot digressions, especially from the wife's sister. That ridiculousness and the part played by the 13 year old son just as his parents are about to be killed by the next bad guys. There's a lot of unnecessary filler here.  The President of the United States wants to get hold of the serum so that people could work longer and contribute longer to Social Security and not bankrupt the system. If Congress would get away from deficit spending, SS wouldn't become bankrupt but that's a different story. What amazed me was that no one considered that by virtue of retiring, job holders move up the ladder and thus open up jobs to the young who need them. Talk about fuzzy thinking! The brief discussion of economics showed the author as out of his league yet the impact of having Americans live longer certainly, amongst other things, is economic, big time and cannot be ignored.<br />The philosophical issues brought up are worthy of discussion, but developed so poorly, it cries out of wasted opportunity.<br />As a thriller, it is so-so. As something that could have been much more than just another \\"family on the run\\" story, it didn't make the grade.eficit spending, SS wouldn't become bankrupt but that's a different story.

Even more disappointing are the reviews on the cover of the paperback from authors (Wiliam Diehl and Dennis Lehane) most of whose works I've enjoyed immensely.  Do these authors read the book?  Do they write the reviews?<br />There's nothing here that hasn't been done better before (much better).  It's unfortunate that the commercial success it seems to have enjoyed, appears to be from readers who have been overly influenced by the drek usually put out on television from whence the author hails.  I had hoped the San Francisco locale would enhance the book, no such luck.<br />The plot is predictable.  Successful lawyer (David) loses mentoring father-in-law in a 'plane crash and expresses his wish that his wandering wife would disappear to someone he meets on the subway (which in San Francisco doesn't go near where he lives).  The police inspectors of the murder are (apparent series regulars) Jane and Kenny.  They are as two dimensional as the rest of the cardboard characters in this \\"mystery\\".  Jane is conveniently starved for affection and is ready to jump into bed with David, the main direct or indirect suspect.  Her history with Kenny conflicts with her involvement with Dave and reaches screaming level.  There is almost no professionalism manifested by the police.  Just like in tv, all you have to do is figure who all the characters are, and eliminate them to figure out the villain. It was amazing Kenny let Jane go without any backup to meet the actual murderer.  Kenny's driving should put him back walking a beat in the Castro where he could resensitize himself.<br />I've been privileged to go to the top of the South Tower of the Golden Gate Bridge (one of the few well written parts of the book), and I know that the security on the Bridge is not as lack as portrayed here.  All electronics in the Tower are monitored in the Guard Station, and that includes the elevator used twice.<br />As a police procedural, as a mystery, as a love story, this lightweight book \\"Falls From (attempted) Grace\\".love story, this lightweight book \\"Falls From (attempted) Grace\\".	2002-01-27

It could stand on its own without the first two, but a less convoluted plot would have aided immensely.<br />Most off Sally's charm comes from the spunk she exhibited previously and abiity to think on her feet.  Now at the ripe old age of 24 or so, a succesful single mom in Victorian London, she sems to have grown complacent.  Her ability to analyze problems, consider options and move ahead with a solution, seems to have left her.  She realizes she doesn't know much about child rearing since she has a nanny do that for her.  She knows who is trying to destroy her life but she doesn't take appropriate measures to protect herself.  In the first book she shows she is capable of shooting someone who threatens her.  Rather coldblooded, but when she knows who wants to steal her home, business and daughter, what more do you need to take aggressive action in your defense?  She could have removed Parrish from the scene, inherited his estate and if she wanted, given her child a last name.  There is plenty of violence in the book so threatening Parrish would not have been illogical.<br />While on the run, still trying to figure out who is trying to ruin her life (despite it being abundantly obvious the first time she meets with her attorney to anyone who has read the first book), Sally is exposed to many socialist ideas.  Since she finds herself attracted to Daniel, the main socialist and there are somewhat bizarre diatribes against capitalism, it's unclear at the end of the book, which economic system will direct the rest of Sally's life.<br />Sally falls into the helpless female role that I found unattractive.  She doesn't need men to help her but it seems progress isn't made until men come to her aid at various times.  It isn't until Jim (my favorite character in the series) comes back from South America near the end that the action picks up.  I found myself skipping over most of the \\"woe is me\\" passages.  The book starts out with a bang, drags through the middle and has a high action conclusion in which nature saves Sally's life.<br />The book still has an abundance of charm, especially to me in the description off many of the lesser characters such as Parrish \\"He's not shy, not backward in coming forward.\\"  There's Sydney \\"Not like some men she knew, all mouth and trousers.\\"  When a girl gang member is comatose and her mates (they \\"looked as if they'd been pickled in sin for years\\") thinks she's dying, they tell her upon finally awakening \\"Devil, Bridie, but you scared us.  We thought you was about to stick your spoon in the wall.\\"<br />Read and enjoy a very nice Victorian novel.ut with a bang, drags through the middle and has a high action conclusion in which nature saves Sally's life.<br />The book still has an abundance of charm, especially to me in the description off many of the lesser characters such as Parrish \\"He's not shy, not backward in coming forward.\\"  There's Sydney \\"Not like some men she knew, all mouth and trousers.\\"  When a girl gang member is comatose and her mates (they \\"looked as if they'd been pickled in sin for years\\") thinks she's dying, they tell her upon finally awakening \\"Devil, Bridie, but you scared us.

She considers herself a feminist although she does nothing else for the cause except ignore the sentiment that women only exhibit \\"susceptibility to the vapors\\".  She's now 22 years old and able to find a sufficient client base of women who need Sally's ability to provide financial consultation.<br />Sally's friend Jim is back in the book which is good since he's the best developed male in all three books.  How can you not like someone as verbally prolific as Jim who describes the case (and the book itself) as \\"There's fraud, there's financial jiggery-pokery, there's spiritualistic humbug, there's all kinds of wickedness, maybe worse.\\"  Later when Sally gives him a sisterly kiss, he remarks \\"That's better than a whisticaster in the rattlers (a smack in the gob)\\".<br />Sally's still friends with the Garlands, who own a photographic studio and detective agency.  Fred Garland develops into a love interest.<br />One day, a retired school teacher tells Sally that her advice for the teacher to invest in a company has had disastrous results.  I had to wonder if they had heard of diversification in those days since the teacher had \\"put all her eggs in one basket\\".  I was also surprised Sally didn't know the company had gone bankrupt, but those are minor points.  Sally resolves to look into the matter.  Her investigations bring her threats and dastardly deeds from the owner of the bankkrupt company.  It develops that her investigation has links to one Fred Garland has ongoing involving a weasel like magician and other mediums who are necessary to provide enough clues to lead the intrepid investigators in the right direction.<br />The clues are too convenient, the bad guys aren't too belivable, the plot twists a bit too contrived, but it doesn't matter.  There's a charm in this series that comes out everywhere, especially its characters.  One is described as \\"He's a Unitarian, Henry; a man of conscience, you might say.\\"  The squalor of London is well described but there always seems to be hope in the lives of the survivors.<br />Not as good as the first but better than the third.  Read them in order and you will always remember the reading as time well spent.or of London is well described but there always seems to be hope in the lives of the survivors.<br />Not as good as the first but better than the third.

It's written for young adults but at 56, I enjoyed it thoroughly.  The second two books find the protagonist, Sally Lockhart in her 20s and probably makes her of less interest to the young adults, not so to us \\"seasoned\\" adults.<br />While the mystery is well thought out, it's a bit far fetched at times, but like so many off the best Victorian and later mysteries, there are strong influences from the kingdom of the Raj, India.<br />Sally needs to solve the mystery of her father's death and her inheritance.  One of the biggest strengths of the book are the characters populating it.  Thre's wicked Mrs. Holland who wears a set of false teeth that are too big for her that she yanked out of her husband's mouth just before his coffin shut forever.  There's also Jim Taylor, sort of a gopher who is no respecter of office clerks, who he regards as \\"a very low form of life\\" and who has some of the best lines in the book when for example he describes the death of somone stealing Sally's money as \\"that's not murder, that's natural justice\\" or \\"She's mad.  Best leave her be, in case it's catching\\".<br />There are a few strange things such as where Jim found the ruby and why Ah Ling felt the need to explain everything to Sally in the end instead of just killing her.  I realize it was necessary to tie up loose plot ends, it's too bad the most feared smuggler in South East Asia was willing to waste precious time to explain how clever he was to a 16 year old girl.<br />Sally isn't concerned about her limitations.  She considers her options and generally makes the right decision.  She has just the right amount of pluck, respects the values taught by her father and lives by them.<br />Strongly recommended.	2002-01-27

The protagonist, a reluctant member of the Witness Protection Program of which she was critical while a New Orleans assistant district attorney, seems like the typical TV female lead, in need of a man to help her (one does get tired of the helpless female character).  Newly widowed (probably by a revenge promising convicted felon), she and her 9 year old daughter move to Boulder, CO.  Kirsten Lord, sees whales (a plot device I could have easily done without) that bring good and bad memories in various forms so for that and her overall state of mind, seeks therapy, thus linking with Allan Gregory who is in a minor role from previous books in this heretofore excellent series.<br />Kirsten's character seems uncharacteristically incapable of making good decisions, instead endlessly repeating in her mind the threat made to her in the courtroom by the man who probably killed her husband.  For somone experienced in making life and death decisions as a district attorney, it was frustrating to see her unable to be more decisive as well as exposing her and her daughter to unnecessary danger such as calling an old friend and giving away the state in which she lived.  Fortunately the man her shallow character needs is another member of the program, a former mob hitman, who is able to be of major assistance as several forces are looking for her to do her harm.  The rationale behind the new hitman (not the one in the Program) was somewhat contrived but it added the suspense this novel would have did without.<br />The reformed hitman, Carl, is fun.  I'm sure a lot of readers chuckled when Kirsten's daughter's asks why Carl's neutered miniature poodle doesn't have what she expected a boy dog to have. After a pause, Carl proudly responds &quot;He may not have nuts, but he has balls.&quot;  I learned more than I wanted when Carl taught me flatulence is a byproduct of torture.<br />The second half of the book moves better towards an exciting and fairly believable climax.  The suspense picks up nicely as Kirsten starts being more responsible.<br />I preferred the other books in the series.  This one had little more than suspense going for it.<br />I recommend all others in the Allan Gregory series and tepidly recommend this one.  I'd suggest starting with the others.er towards an exciting and fairly believable climax.

The victims are wearing  American &amp; British uniforms so Russian authorities invite England and the US to join in a joint effort to solve the mystery. Charlie Muffin, the British representative, doesn't want to go, but after getting there the investigative juices take over and he starts enjoying the battle of wits in which he can't trust anyone including the British government much less the CIA who have wanted his scalp since the first great book in this series and a fine TV segment with the delightful David Hemmings in the title role.  When Charlie does identify the bodies, he finds he's even more vulnerable and exposed and has to lead the other parties down the garden path so that enough of the truth can be exposed without increasing the danger to him and his lover, a high person in the current Russian spy organization that we've met in previous books.<br />While this book is complex, it's representative of the current state of espionage in which the good guys and bad guys aren't as easily identified as in the Cold War.  Those who were bad guys yesterday can be the good guys today.  It's often every man (or woman) for themselves.<br />The book seemed a tad long but each new devlopment added another useful piece to the puzzle.  If you like novels in which the mystery is more who is going to outsmart the other rather than whodunnit, this is for you.  Freemantle is a master at developing situations in which one survives or dies by their wits, ability to recognize clues you hope your &quot;allies&quot; don't see and how to anticipate where the attacks will come (from enemies and allies alike).<br />Charlie Muffin is one of the most clever (if not the most) series protagonists in the Crime/Spy genre.  You can't breeze through this book, you need to pay attention all along so you don't miss the nuggets Charlie mines.  Freemantle doesn't hit you over the head with clues, you have to work at it, and for me that greatly increases the pleasure from this terrific series.<br />I wish the next sequel would come sooner than this one did.  Incidentally, I haven't enjoyed other books by this author nearly as much as the ones with Charlie Muffin.lues, you have to work at it, and for me that greatly increases the pleasure from this terrific series.<br />I wish the next sequel would come sooner than this one did.

The story does very well in portraying life in Vermont and the politics in a small city in which everyone has to answer to someone.<br />The character development is well done and the love interest aspect is satisfying.  There are a plenty of subplots, maybe too many, but the overall story is inventive without being too complicated.  However the various successful developments of solving the mystery do seem to be very conveniently available.<br />The solution is more of following the dots than putting the pieces of the puzzle together to get the big picture, the way most police solve crimes.<br />Better than the average crime novel but if you read 1-3 a week, you might have trouble remembering much about the book 2 weeks after finishing it.	2002-01-13

Thanks very much.<br />The opportunities to make an important American history connection that are contained in this book are inspirational.<br />I just got back from the Delta (there's only one, isn't there?) last month (12/01) and had the opportunity to visit 8 sites.  I drove a small car with my 15 year old son, and the information this book and my experience with the blues provided, prevented the mayhem one frequently associates with excessive exposure between generations from the same family.<br />We started in Leland and went to Clarksdale and came down to Greenwood and back to Leland.<br />While I expect to continue to use this book for years to come as my family and I go back to annually visit the in-laws, my sole complaint is the directions.  I've driven from Guatemala to Vancouver and been in 26 countries, so I have a well seasoned sense of direction.  Perhaps I'm overly pedantic but some of the directions did not anticipate some of the predictable confusion I experienced.<br />While the directions to Zion Church in Greenwood were good, confirmation such as a green roof or easily visible from a mile away just after the curve to the right would be helpful.  It was a lovely church but I was a somewhat self conscious about parking in the driveway.  Fortunately there wasn't anyone else there at the time.<br />The graveyard for Mississippi John Hurt was fascinating but the directions could have been a bit better.  When a turn is called out and the driver makes it, I'd prefer to see right away that one should park right after 1.0 miles.  By the time my son read the preceding information, before the distance,to me, I wasn't sure how many tenths of a mile we'd gone.  So, do we turn around to the mail boxes or try to guess?

The locals walking that road saw me 4 times in a half hour, probably livened up their day.<br />I'm sure I expect too much, but I would have liked some idea about the driving time between sites with a line item complete itinerary in the back with the driving time between the site you're looking at and the site on the line above.

US	49685521	R3TG1YOEGH9R13	0380789175	154562288	The Crook Factory	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Very Good story but too slow and too long	J Edgar Hoover wants FBI agent Joe Lucas (half Hispanic and a proven killer) to join the famous writer Ernest Hemmingway in Cuba who has offered to run a spy ring against the Germans in 1942.  J Edgar knows Hemmingway to be charming and warns Joe not to fall under Hemingway's spell.<br />Joe (writing throughout the book in the first person) knows there's lots more to his function than keeping the local amateur Keystone Kops out of trouble and focuses on finding out J. Edgar's true motive while trying to keep from enjoying too much the stimulation and relaxation afforded by being at Hemmingway's farm, thre first he's had in many a year.<br />This is very good historical fiction.  Hemmingway actually did offer to spy on the Germans in Cuba as well as track German submarines dropping off spys in Cuban waters.  His involvement in this period was chronicled by him in his bittersweet &quot;novel&quot; &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; and William Granger's &quot;Hemmingway's Notebook&quot; and others.  As a sidenote: I found most of &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; to be a delightful movie with George C. Scott in one of his two best roles, Claire Bloom, Gilbert Roland and the wonderful rascal David Hemmings.<br />Alfred Hitchcock once said (paraphrasing him) &quot;A movie is like life with the boring parts taken out&quot;.  This book left the boring parts in.  While the characterizations are first rate (except for Hemmingway being somewhat stereotyped) and the attention to historical detail is admirably researched, there's just too much that isn't necessary in this 576 pages.  The pages that describe the detail of what happened while waiting for something else to happen, didn't help the book.  I certainly enjoyed how well Simmons described the American characters with the culture of 60 years ago as my parents related to me long ago.  Too many books seem to get lazy as they describe characters from 50, 100 or more years ago as if they had today's values, mores, language and goals.  Simmons doesn't fall into that trap.<br />He does fall into a celebrity trap by bringing in Gary Cooper, Ingrid Bergman, Marlene Dietrich and Ian Fleming.  Their intoduction to the story didn't seem necessary and added clutter.<br />The action scenes are well done and not overly confusing.  However Joe eventually confirms he has more to fear from his own agency than he does from the Germans.  Joe is shown to be very clever with a &quot;photographic&quot; memory.  I believe the book would have been better if it focused more on Joe's ability to solve ongoing mysteries than on historical accuracy.<br />Recommended but not a &quot;must read&quot; book.nd goals.

Authors can't always be on target, this book isn't. Yet while the book doesn't really hit its mark like &quot;Purple Cane Road&quot;, it's a lot better than some of the other drek out there that won't get this close on their best day.  Don't waste your time with the movie of Robicheaux's early exploits.  That said. . . .<br />Billy Bob Holland, a Deaf Smith Texas attorney visits an old Texas neighbor Doc. Voss in the Bitterroot Valley in Montana.  This is the second time Burke has written about this amazingly beautiful part of the West.  I preferred the previous story &quot;The Lost Get-Back Boogie&quot; both for the story and descriptions of Montana.<br />The &quot;mystery&quot; is who killed an undesirable biker &quot;brain dead misogynists&quot; that Doc Voss had recently damaged in a fight, resulting in Doc's arrest and need to go to trial.  The mystery becomes less and less germane to the story as we guess early on who the murderer is.<br />Why Do These People Talk to Each Other This Way &amp; why do they take it when being addressed in such offensive fashion?  I live in the West and normally peaceful people would not talk this way to anyone unless armed and ready to fight, certainly not every waking moment.  The characters in Dave Robicheaux's world in Southern Louisiana talk this way; it's a Burke trademark of dialogue but it's losing it's appeal.  Perhaps it's meant to be abstract.  Normal conversation in which people reflect a bit more beforehand, and are not trying to offend or hurt someone's feelings would be welcome.  Maybe the intention towards the other person in all the book's conversations is expressed early on in the book by Cleo Lonnigan &quot;Sometimes if you confess your real thoughts, people will be afraid of you.&quot;  The protagonist, Billy Bob says to his romantic interest &quot;With regularity I say the wrong things to you, I just don't want to do that anymore.&quot;  Yet it seems until the very end, he doesn't change saying &quot;the wrong things&quot; to her and everyone else in the book.<br />The book becomes overpopulated with characters, many of whom follow Billy Bob to Montana, including Billy Bob's 18 year old son, a potential girl friend and a very well drawn villain who speaks in an amusing but unlikely fashion.  Some of the superfluous characters in the story include BATF agents.  Their involvement appears to be an attempt to make a connection between the Oklahoma City bombing and a militia group in the area.  That plot detour goes nowhere and the three agents seem to be acting in an unlikely  renegade fashion.<br />Doc Voss is not developed very well and just about everyone seems to have a deathwish based on their actions.  The overriding current is not found where everyone wants to fish, it's made up of violence.  Just about everyone is a whole lot more self-destructive than the people I've encountered in my 56 years.  When I've found people like them, they sure didn't concentrate in one place like they do here.  As a minor character says to Billy Bob &quot;You must put away your violence, sir.  You will never have peace until you do.  Until that day comes, a minister such as I will only be a seashell echoing in the wind.&quot;  &quot;Seashell echoing in the wind&quot;?  How come I don't know anyone that talks like that?<br />I have to wonder if Robicheaux/Holland are just wearing out.  The sheriff is well described, especially when he &quot;walked away heavily, like a man who knew his knowledge of the world would never have an influence on it.&quot;  The rest of the characters confirm Billy Bob's observation &quot;it's presumptuous to assume a common moral belief governs us all.&quot;<br />In addition to beautiful descriptions of the Montana scenery and wildlife, most of which resonate &amp; delight, there are enjoyable and startling for their unadorned clarity, descriptions of character's passage of emotions.  &quot;Eventually he would forgive Sue Lynn, not at once, not by a conscious choice or arriving at a philosophical moment, but instead one day he would look back through the inverted telescope of time and see her as possessed of the same moral frailties as himself and hence, in memory, an acceptable part of his life again.&quot;  It's passages like that which will keep me going back to Jimmie Lee Burke.e and startling for their unadorned clarity, descriptions of character's passage of emotions.  &quot;Eventually he would forgive Sue Lynn, not at once, not by a conscious choice or arriving at a philosophical moment, but instead one day he would look back through the inverted telescope of time and see her as possessed of the same moral frailties as himself and hence, in memory, an acceptable part of his life again.&quot;  It's passages like that which will keep me going back to Jimmie Lee Burke.	2002-01-05

The sentiment was much more pervasively Christian during the 1860-1870s when Hall made his 3 trips to the north and was able to get farther north than any Westerner had until then.  In the Afterword, Loomis describes some of the appeal the vast, unexplored Artic must have had for Westerners.  The Artic was both magnificent and terrifying, it was as Byron wrote &quot;All that expands the spirit, yet appals.&quot;  Loomis explains that the public had an asthetic of the sublime and this went a long way to explain to me the attraction Polar exploration must have had for Hall.  But as a modern day mountaineer Fred Beckey said, &quot;Man is not always a welcome visitor in a kingdom he cannot control.&quot;<br />The American explorer Kane, who died at age 36 was so revered by the American public for his exploits, that when his body was brought to New Orleans and then went up the Mississippi to it's ultimate burial location, people lined the river the entire way to bid him farewell.  This helps explain the regard the public had for explorers (especially the ones who wrote accessible books).<br />Hall leads the first two expeditions in search of one of the overriding mysteries of the time, what happened to the members of the British expedition led by Sir John Franklin.  The last and fatal voyage was in search of the North Pole.  However, because of the funding by the US government of the expedition, the loss of Hall and loss of the ship itself, there was a US Naval inquiry.  Because of the quasi-Naval nature of the expedition, there was insufficient discipline on the expedition and the loss of the leader under strange circumstances caused most discipline to evaporate thus dooming the expedition.<br />Loomis undertook his own mini-expedition 97 years after Hall's death in 1871. He visited Hall's gravesite and performed an autopsy with very interesting results.<br />The book is well written so that during the narrative when the details might seem tedious, they are not.  Exhaustively researched and well presented with essential maps, photographs and a list of the crew on the last voyage.<br />Read and enjoy.the expedition.<br />Loomis undertook his own mini-expedition 97 years after Hall's death in 1871.

I'm a HUGE fan of Perry, so much so that every 2 years I reread all his books.  Unfortunately &quot;Death Benefits&quot; was weaker than those preceding it and &quot;Pursuit&quot; is even weaker.  I'm trying to think if I would have felt differently had I not read all of Perry's books beforehand.  I don't think so.  Since I get annoyed with reviewers who say &quot;there's much better out there&quot; and fail to make suggestions, I'll recommend the late Ross Thomas' books starting with &quot;Briarpatch&quot; and of course Perry's books prior to the last two.<br />The entire book dragged.  The killer might be called psychotic (I believe it means they can't tell the difference between right and wrong), but I believes he does, he just doesn't care what is right or wrong.  The killer's history isn't interesting but we're exposed to a plethora of it.  The minutea of his life doesn't enhance my knowledge of his character, especially since he's certainly not a sympathetic character.<br />The title describes the story.  However the biggest disappointment to me was the careless fashion in which the pursuer constantly and incompetently lets the killer get away.  Why there wasn't a poison gas canister in the trap in Buffalo, why there wasn't a source of lethal electricity in the house in Minnesota, amazes me.  Granted hindsight is 20/20, but we're talking about the pursuer having weeks to plan.  Finally, there are a minimum of 4 unnecessary deaths of probably good people before the pursuer follows the course of action he should have in the first place.<br />I'm sorry, this book started well with a nice set up that appeared to be a contest of cleverness, and dragged into a plodding story in which I just wanted to get it over with.	2002-01-02

The story keeps your interest for most of the time. I did want to like this book more, but ultimately it was just a nice story to me.<br />The protagonist, Joe Trona was scarred, in infancy, with acid in the face by an angry father. He's saved by an Orange County, CA politician from a life of anger and the attendant manifestations anger can bring. The politician and his wife adopt young Joe who grows up to become a Sheriff's deputy all the while being tutored in the political life by his new father, an ex cop. Unfortunately the ex cop's instincts fail him and he is assassinated early on, leaving 24 year old Joe to vow vengeance.<br />Joe is a loner without much experience with women but his first encounter in the book with a woman his age becomes a mutual total commitment immediately. The budding relationship is handled nicely.<br />Just as Joe's Dad ignores his cop instincts, Joe forgets his and is taken captive. The scenes following the hostage taking are very well done.<br />I found it hard to believe a 24 year old living in a uniformed environment could be as methodical and correct as Joe needs to be in order to be successful in this satisfying story. Ultimately, soon after reading this story, not much had stayed with me and I was reaching for the next book.<br />I will buy Jeff Parker's next book which I hope will stay with me longer, as most of his previous works have done.	2001-12-30

There is no rough language or gratuitous sex.  I recommend this book for young adults.<br />In the 1880s, George Armstrong Custer, President of the US is affronted that neither as General or US President, has he been able to take over the Unorganized Territory they &quot;bought&quot; from the French.  The Cheyenne have been able to hold off the US because of their domestication of two types of dinosaurs that provide them with mobility during raids and battle.  Custer's only son is an Army captain and is sent to scout the Cheyenne from a dirigible.  A thunderstorm causes the dirigible to crash, thus fulfilling a vision received by the book's best drawn out character, Speaks While Leaving, a medicine woman.  Custer jr. is the poorest drawn character and I'm not clear why the Cheyenne would follow him except to finish the last part of the vision.<br />The premise was somewhat simplistic and the mission/journey taken by the war/peace party was not entirely realistic.  Because of this and the weakness of the Custer jr. character, I was unable to give this book a 5 star rating.<br />The level on which it succeeded most for me was the solidarity expressed amongst the Cheyenne as well as with their indigenous neighbors.  I was able to feel their joy and know its source was the passion they felt in everything they did.  The book expressed some of their sprituality but not too much.  Just as the Cheyenne's life contained balance, so too did this book.<br />The descriptions of the Cheyenne life and why certain things were done in a certain way, enhanced my pleasure with this book.  It almost seems Maria Montessori would enjoy the integration of all aspects of the Cheyenne life.<br />This story stays with me.  I hope there'll be a sequel.	2001-12-29

This is the first time I agreed with all the reviewers, whether they panned the book or loved it.  No it wasn't well written, the bad guys aren't all going to grovel in front of the FBI, the rookie black agent and his romance are not well addressed, the black characters are either all good or all bad, all characters are pretty stereotypical with the good guys idealized and the bad guys demonized. and yes the plot is more like a series of vignettes that tie together too neatly at the end.<br />But so what?  This is a fun book.  It wasn't meant to be the Bard.  The characters in the trenches are likeable and the witticisms are often hilarious (they almost steal the book).  The FBI doesn't get a lot of respect these days and no wonder since the general impression is the administrators care more about improving their careers than removing crime and in so doing, all too often forget good case solving technique and procedure.  However this book gives hope to those of us who want to have good feelings about the FBI, that there are those agents who believe in what they're doing, not solely about career advancement.<br />This book stayed with me a little longer than the typical 3 books a week that I normally read.  I've read Paul Lindsay's subsequent books and they're an improvement over this book in terms of character and plot development.  If you like this book, then you should get the rest of them.  I've asked Amazon to notify me when his next book is out.<br />P.S. I hope the former FBI agnt who reviewed this book (and gave it a positive review and whose reviews of other books I enjoyed), had a spell check feature on his computer when he wrote reports in his capacity as an FBI agent.	2001-12-15

The first page and a half are hilarious, then Myron gets overly juvenile. The bit about Win's source of meditation sounds is ridiculous. After 7 books, I'd like to see Myron grow up. It's easy to understand why his partner rolls her eyes all the time.<br />The mystery is rather soap opera-ish. The bad guy is predictable when you realize all the clues are pointing to a character that doesn't show up until the last 10 or so pages. The explanation of how Myron figures out who, what, why and where is pretty convoluted. The book has a flow but the flow gets all jumbled up with the explanation in the last few pages.<br />I'll continue to buy Coben's books unless the next one is worse than this one. I hope not since the characters are for the most part, endearing, especially the parents.	2001-12-11
US	49685521	R3LKGRFX6IDQBP	0688163165	733601761	Mystic River	Books	3	2	6	N	N	Dark, well written but not upllifting	My favorite genre is mysteries and Dennis Lehane is in the Top 10 of favorite authors.  Probably the same way the main characters in this book are compelled to do what they do, Lehane got this story idea in his head and couldn't do anything until he got it out of his system.  I just wish it could have had a positive ending.  The ending is probably more true to life, so my wish for happier says more about my tastes than the reality most people create.<br />It is extremely well written, but ultimately that wasn't enough for me.  I lost interest in it as a mystery pretty early on and settled in to appreciate it as literature.  It is a remarkable tale of turn of the century Boston.  Although I like Boston a whole lot, I wouldn't want to spend one second with any of these characters the next time I visit.  They're on a merry go round of their own making and are either too stubborn or too blind to evaluate themselves and get off so they can stop being at the effect of others.  I found myself drawn, despite the slowness of the story,  by the sparse and intense writing, onto the merry go round.  I was glad when the ending let me get off.  The book didn't get stronger, it seemed to get weaker.  I found it overwritten.<br />Stark and dark realism, no matter how well written, doesn't do it for me any more.  I'm glad so many people enjoyed as much as they did.  I wish I had been one of them.	2001-12-10

I had read glowing reviews and gave this one a chance.  I don't understand what the attraction is.  The storyline appeals to peoples' rage regarding their perceived inequities of society.  The writing is manipulative intending to have the reader overlook the sterotypical cardboard characters.  There are the white hats and the black hats with no one in between.  I enjoy post apocalyptic (after the Great War - apparently any time now) stories but this one is ridiculous.  The good guys love freedom and the bad guys are all crazed Nazis.  That's it, they're either Rebels (good guys) or Nazis, nothing in between.  The Nazi men all enjoy sex with young boys and have frequent temper tantrums.  The good guys live in the old United States (Canada seems to have separated itself from the continent), Mexico still appears to exist but the border between the two countries apparently still is recognized although why I can't imagine.  The bad guys are combination of Nazis from South (where it is all Nazi) and North America.  It seems in previous books there were zombies and other mutant enemies to blow up with delighted zeal.  The Rebels must be all shell shocked since they have no compunction about blowing away 30 people each before lunch time.<br />If you like lots of references to different armament and how many ways they cause carnage (there's lots of that here), you'll love this book.  The main characters all lead charmed lives.  Bullets hit everyone else and if they ever dare to get near the heroes, body armor deflects any damage.<br />The main characters live to get into the non-stop battle from Kansas, to Cheyenne to Mexico where the main character is captured and facing a firing squad when the book ends.  If that isn't manipulative (buy the next book), I don't know what is.<br />The main characters drive around in Hummers always getting ahead of their troops but always avoiding injury.  They never seem to have to take sanitary breaks, eat or sleep.  Their lives are on hold until they conquer the world for the white hats.<br />Lastly, the endless supply of food, fuel and armament defies reason.  Prepare to suspend belief on a major scale.to take sanitary breaks, eat or sleep.

I'm reviewing the series for the most part.  Kerney is pleasent enough although he gets less so in subsequent books.  These are &quot;feel good&quot; fluff books.  I enjoy the South West and I enjoy well written mysteries so I hoped there'd be something close to Hillerman.  There just isn't enough of substance to keep me sustained.  I understand McGarrity was a cop in New Mexico and his love of the local country is a major highlight to my enjoyment of the books.  However I have to believe that when McGarrity was performing police work, his cases were not solved that easily nor was he shot or injured as often as Kerney is.  Kerney pretty much leads a charmed life going from subsistence living in the first book to inheriting valuable acreage in this book from a former teacher who he was nice to.  Where are those nice old ladies when we want to have more material possessions in our lives?  I'd like to be like Kerney who always knows when someone is a low down varmint and he can therefore treat them like dogs because it's convenient to the plot.  I forget which book (they tend to run together) has Kerney bedeviling a young ne'er do well until the kid dies unnecessarily.  The impression I got was that the kid was a disposable person and there are plenty of them out there so no one will mourn their passing.  The way the kid was portrayed, was he would never be a great asset to society and so we get the impression it's ok for people to die because they'll never be a CEO or write poetry or drive a race car fast.  I wanted to like this series.  Kerney doesn't need to start drinking or gambling to make himself more interesting, but after a while you need more so you can keep on liking him.  Too much black and white, not enough greys.  Thin stuff.	2001-11-25

I don't forsee the need to hire any assasins in the near future, but I know who I wouldn't want to hire if I needed any.  All the plot twists and their eventual consequences were predictable.  There was the reappearance of a former lover that triggered the main tragedy in the protagonist's life propeling him into retirement, there was the Boss who manipulated the protagonist in his own secret agenda, there was the protagonist coming out of retirement for one last revenge, there was the bad guy with a potentially fatal condition, it just goes on.  I didn't care for any of the characters nor could I see what made them special as assasins. A main plot twist develops because the assasins can't bug a bad guy's apartment without nearly getting caught but still tipping him off.  The female protagonist couldn't hide her emotions from the bad guy, but the scheme hinges on her abilities as a pro.  The book is like a car with a sticky gas pedal, it speeds up then slows down, endlessly.  The epilogue has no redeeming characteristics.  There's lots better out there.  Look at some of the espionage Lists on Amazon.	2001-11-25

Use a breakout/breakunder system with appropriate money management and you'll save the price of this book.  Let's not hold our breath.<br />Not that it would ever happen, but where authors write books specifically targeting a distinct audience (but not really, just target audience exploitation), I wish the publisher provided a web site as a companion to the book.  You'd have a one week password access to determine if you want to buy the book.  The first day the site might say &quot;The indicator on Page 179 is getting a set up in the Spanish Peseta.&quot;  The next day, you'd get one or more messages about a diffferent indicator in a different currency, etc.  After a week you'd see if you would have put on any good positions and if you liked the eventual results, you'd buy the book.  Kind of a put up or shut up approach.<br />They did use nice paper though.	2001-11-25

So acts of contrition and soul searching follow.  But there's always someone who wants him to come out of retirement but it requires balancing &quot;the morality scales&quot;, i.e. unspeakable acts have to be committed against him before he'll &quot;strap on his guns again&quot; and seek vengeance that just happens to benefit the country's needs (in the author's view).<br />The style is an old style of writing.  Lots of filler. Lots about someone that after their story is told, they get their throat cut.  Lots of flashbacks.  And of course, even after the head of the Medusa is chopped off, tentacles remain: a follow up?<br />He's a better writer than I am, but I'm not a writer.  This book is formulaic and predictable....	2001-03-16

This new book relies strongly (90%+) on dialogue between a man and a woman in which much of the man's &quot;contributions&quot; to their conversations seem to come from being quite distracted, he's always asking &quot;what&quot;, &quot;huh&quot; or making off the wall and ludicrous assumptions.  She patiently puts up with his conversational lack of focus.  He's certainly not very sympathetic in that he is an assassin for hire.  He's clever but I can't imagine any situation (regardless of what I thought he did for a living) in which I'd want to spend time with him.  There are other fictional assassins who are much more interesting as individuals.  The premise of the story about competition in the assassin business certainly can't be taken very seriously.  I wanted the book to be over by the half way point. This one is below the midway mark in Block's long list of books.	2001-02-10

There are a limited number of authors whose books I'll reread every few years and all of Perry's books heretofore have fit into that category.  When I saw him at a booksigning last year and he explained about Jane being left to wedded bliss and new characters in the next book, I had no regrets since so many series characters become stale after a while.<br />Max Stillman is fun but a not-unwelcome repetition of similar characters that figured prominently in &quot;Metzger's Dog&quot; and I believe &quot;Dance for the Dead&quot;.  I enjoyed Max's comment about age in which he says &quot;The ones (changes) you can't see are bigger than the ones you can.  One day you just discover that you can't watch this movie or read this book or have this conversation any more.  Sometimes you've had it too many times already, but at others, it's not even that.  It's just that nothing in it is anything that you're interested in anymore.&quot;<br />Perry's books are always about clever people and I enjoy the way he uses his secondary characters so the primary person can explain how they're in fact so clever (it's done totally modestly).  Max starts out being clever but too many years or too many of the old fashioned Mai Tais creep up and he loses his edge and becomes very naive towards the end.<br />While the maturation under fire of John Walker is interesting, his statements don't always stay in character.  Sometimes he seems the only one who knows what's going on and then he's back to the bumbling way he was.  There are numerous implausible circumstances.<br />Those are the cons.  While this is the weakest of all Perry's books, he's done so well before, he's entitled.  How does this compare to what else is out there, not much of a contest.  Will I read this book with Perry's others every summer in which the year is even-numbered, you betcha.	2001-02-02
US	49685521	RQWMJGYDRWHCE	0071352325	180281585	Strategies for the Electronic Futures Trader	Books	1	7	7	N	N	A Waste of Money - &lt;1 Star	This book looks just like a compilation of the &quot;author's&quot; position trading books but with editing to put in the words &quot;day trading&quot; where &quot;position trading&quot; used to be.  There's no other difference.  The only potentially useful info to a newbie was about monitoring the first 30 minutes to try to determine the direction of the day.  However, everyone has been doing that for years and most websites suggest it, without charging.  Who doesn't know what an oscillator divergence is?  That's not a system and while a valid indicator for some trading styles, is certainly not unique to day trading.  Mr. Bernstein was reportedly run off tv with his infomercials that made claims the government stated he couldn't back up.  Put his name in a search engine to see what others say about him.  If you want to get your money's worth, read whatever Larry Williams' latest book is.  He'll show you his brokerage records, Mr. Bernstein won't.  'Nuff said.	2000-12-27
