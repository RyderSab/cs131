And how their ideas influenced the transformation of Scotland, England, and later the rest of the world through the work of such legends as Witherspoon, Bell, Carnegie, Livingstone, ... Needless to say, the modern world is not the work of a mere handful of people, much less a mere handful of Scots.  The Scots, however, were the right people at the right time to have exerted a dramatic impact, and in Herman's view, in far greater proportional representation than any other ethnic group. <br /> <br />Herman's story of the Scots placed a great emphasis on the positive side of the Scots' accomplishments.  He also took pains to present, over and over again, the not so glamorous side of the affair - the tribal backwardness, the persistent poverty, the plight of those displaced by progress, the discontent of being subordinate to England, etc, etc.  In the concluding chapter, especially, Herman proffered a critical assessment of the Scottish Enlightenment and the British Empire - that it is a force that has run its course, and modernization is exacting its price on that very society that had brought it to the world. <br /> <br />Some say that Herman is a white supremacist, and some say he has a bias so deep that he presented the Scots in a good light, even in their most dubious enterprises, such as the Opium War.  A white man is no more a white supremacist when he writes about the achievements of white men than a black is a black supremacist when he writes about the achievements of black men.  As to bias, we all have it, although we tend see more clearly that in others. <br /> <br />Herman, in connection with the work of David Livingstone, stipulated that cultural supremacy, as opposed to racial supremacy, was real and tangible and, although I might add, not necessarily permanent - a point of view that certainly did not endear him to the politically correct crowd.  If anyone doubts that, he has quite simply not learned anything from history.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-21

Nonetheless, I found this book well worth my limited reading time, as it is informative and truly engaging.   <br /> <br />The history of the Royal Navy is essentially a history of the emergence and decline of the British Empire.  Reliving this history from the angle of the Royal Navy, with unvarnished assessments on luminaries from Hawkins, Drake, Anson, Cook, Nelson all the way to Churchill, and their adversaries, has been a welcome educational experience for me.  For the history of the Royal Navy is not just about sea battles; it is also about navigational technology, exploration, colonization, combating piracy and slave trade, quest for knowledge about nature, etc. all of which the Royal Navy had taken a lead role. <br /> <br />The Royal Navy is a great institution.  It is certainly not without flaws and its history is not without unglamorous passages.  It is, nonetheless, the embodiment of the strength and character and resourcefulness of the British nation and her people.  To Rule the Waves tells a compelling story of history. <br />	2005-04-07

As a purveyor of gossip it does a marvelous job.  It tells you more than you ever want to know about the background of some discoveries and the human side of some of the big names in science and technology.  <br />Bryson sourced his materials from an impressive array of books and other publications and weaved them into a readable, almost connected, set of essays.  As we all know, just because something appears in print does not mean it is true, and just because something is true does not mean it is the whole story, much less an objective one.  I don't know how much of the material has been independently confirmed.<br />Unlike most other books of this genre, which focus on informing the lay reader on the science and the scientists, and add some gossip to liven things up, this book is full of gossip and has scant retainable information.  <br />It is not a bad book to kill time on a plane and be entertained; it is just not particularly useful.	2004-02-07

If you were expecting to be enriched by lots of kitchen lore and simple explanations (which was my original aim) you would be disappointed.  This book tells you much more about tidbits of history, physics, chemistry and physiology than tips and tricks for cooking and is, in truth, quite long-winded.<br />Now if you are also interested in the acquisition of knowledge of various sorts, common as well as obscure, and don't mind being the &quot;most knowledgeable amateur&quot; among your friends, this is an excellent source of information.  The author spares no ink in serving up history, scientific theory and experiments (The famous oil drop experiment by physicist Millikan, a Caltech cohort of the author, was featured!  Plus many of his own), findings in medicine, etc. in covering a subject, even &quot;simple&quot; ones like browning of vegetables by salad dressings.<br />If you managed through the first couple of chapters, you will probably go on, and you will quickly find that the author is a no-nonsense scientist (Ah! the Caltech imprint) and his stuff is well baked, so to speak.  By the time you finish the book, you will learn much more than a few useful tips to augment your cooking skills, and find your reading time quite well spent.	2004-01-25

Many excellent reviews have been written for this book and quite frankly I can add little more.  But I cannot resist writing a few words after reading and tremendously enjoying this rather charming memoir.<br />The author chronicled her somewhat adventurous settling in the Italian Riviera through (almost impulsively) buying a very old farmhouse - with a few dozen olive trees to go with it, and struggling to make it a home, and herself and her sister part of the community.  San Pietro was not exactly known for being hospitable to outsiders, how did this pair of foreign females (extra virgins) manage to get accepted as part of the community - in fact, practically as everyone's darlings?  Well, they were friendly, respectful, open-minded, conscientious, and armed with a tremendous sense of humor.<br />Besides learning a good deal about the life style and food fares of the Northern Italian peasantry, the landscape and climate of the place, and the folklores and sentiment of the locals - all through a gracious style of writing, with wit and humor in good measure, I must say I also learn from the author much wisdom for getting to know and live with strangers in a strange place.<br />If you have not read this book, you should not wait any longer.	2004-01-12

More importantly, this is a book about the meaning and the pursuit of excellence.<br />Murray has an important message, which crystallizes toward the end of the book.  An important part of the human spirit, after the basic needs of survival and procreation are met, is its natural attraction to truth, beauty and good.  (This is the best elaboration I have seen of what is meant by the &quot;pursuit of Happiness&quot; in our Declaration of Independence)  Given the right cultural climate, the emergence of excellence in the pursuit of truth, beauty and good, will thrive. I do not know if Murray had that message in mind and used the data to support it, or that he analyzed the data to conclude on that message.  Either way, the message is powerful.<br />Murray also made the point the religion (not organized religion, but a mature contemplation of truth, beauty and good) and its contagiousness is what is behind the waves of achievements and discoveries in history, entailing superhuman efforts and sacrifices that produced the greatest art and the articulation of the most insightful truths.<br />There is in this book a detail list of &quot;inventories&quot; of great and significant figures and an elaboration of how they are selected, with special consideration -- allowing quotas, if you will -- for non-Western achievements.  The inventories will undoubtedly generate a lot of debate from the PC crowd.  Murray anticipated that and did quite a bit of that debate within the book.  If you are a serious reader of the book, you will find that the inventories, despite the amount of space devoted to them, are mere launching pad for the thesis of what is the meaning of excellence.<br />Like &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, this book is not for everybody.  But for those who are drawn to the pursuit and appreciation of greatness and deference to truth, this book resonates powerfully with the mind.s powerfully with the mind.	2003-12-09

This is one of a handful that I find to be particularly informative. While most art instruction books tell you what to do and how to do it, Jeanne Dobie patiently explains why. In other words, she tells you what is behind the magic. <br />For example, she says that you cannot get a good green by mixing any yellow and any blue, because, a yellow such as cadmium yellow contains some red and a blue such as ultramarine also contains some red, and the presence of red in green (the hoped-for color), which are complements on the color wheel, yields gray.  Thus the resulting green is very muted.  Explanations such as this are invaluable to me, because the underlying reasons she gives completely convinces me that she is right and the knowledge is extensible to other color combinations.<br />There are many such gems of knowledge in this book.  Jeanne Dobie teaches you how to create not just contrast, but a &quot;singing&quot; combination of colors, and how to mix your own blacks and your own whites to achieve much more nuanced presentations.  And there is much more.<br />Admittedly, some artists do not feel bound by these &quot;rules&quot; of color and can still produce very good art.  Charles Reid comes to mind.  For the rest of us, the wisdoms Jeanne Dobie shares in this book are an important part of an artist's knowledge base.	2003-11-23

The substance of the book, however, is rather lightweight. <br />The author presents a great deal of information and analysis on many subjects, from history to religion to nationalism to corporate governance, etc.  So, for your money, you get to read a lot, but all without much coherence and with little depth. <BR> <BR>Harvey is mildly biased against the United States of America. In some sense his tirades are a good illustration of the adage that your are damned if you do and you are damned if you don't. Harvey criticizes the U.S. military intervention in certain cases, Panama and Grenada, but then he also criticizes the U.S. for not intervening in certain crises, like Bosnia and Rwanda. In fact, there was a \\"lost decade\\", according to Harvey, of not sending our troops to maintain order.  His thesis seems to be that if the U.S. flexes her military muscles to protect her interests, it was wrong, she should only put her soldiers in harm's way to pacify ethnic fighting and other regional conflicts where she has no political, economic or military stake.  Thanks a lot for that advice!<br />Harvey argued that even though the September 11 attack was the worst single act of terrorism, it was not REALLY bad when put beside of the vast number of people terrorists killed year-in and year-out; in fact it was \\"a drop in the ocean\\" (!) compared with the number of civilians killed in Dresden, Tokyo and Hiroshima during WWII. This is how Harvey asks to put matters in perspective. <BR>His bias notwithstanding, Harvey does offer some sobering facts on how America is intensely disliked in some parts of the world, and why, at least according to his reasoning.  There is, in fact, not much mystery here.  Envy is a powerful human emotion.  If the price for not being disliked were for the U.S. to be a loser, I would not care much for it. <br />The redeeming values of the book are the breadth of subjects covered and a lucid writing style.  It is not entirely a waste of time as I do want to get a perspective of the U.S. and the world as seen from a Brit, even though I might not be in total agreement.	2003-11-20

If you are halfway interested in politics and history, there is nothing in this book that you don't already know, other than being able to glean through the actual words spoken by the policy makers of the time - what was &quot;behind the scenes&quot; was not startlingly different than what was on the TV screen.<br />I am disappointed with this book, not least because I am much impressed by Dr. Kissinger's other work, especially his defining tome: Diplomacy.<br />I am thankful for the tip given by the previous reviewer from Amsterdam, pointing out where to get the declassified information from the NSA.

It is organized around a set of constitutional issues as illustrated by what might be called some of the landmark cases pertaining to those issues.  Starr manages to lay out highly legalistic issues in simple terms without diluting their significance, and in the process walks the reader through the history of the Court since the New Deal Court, all the way to the most recent Rehnquist Court decisions.  The Court's history, as such, in large measure reflects the Nation's history as seen through the litigation of some of the most controversial issues - abortion, free speech, church and state, criminal justice, affirmative action, federalism, etc.  <br />In telling his story, Starr puts great emphasis on the background and judicial philosophy of the individual justices, which puts a human dimension to an otherwise academic subject.<br />&quot;First Among Equals&quot; is a worthwhile effort that bridges a gap between the highly legalistic arguments and the ordinary people, whose life are profoundly affected by the decisions of the Court.  For anyone who is interested in rendering after-dinner opinions on events in the political, social and legal landscapes, this book is an invaluable backgrounder.	2003-10-28

But the giant is not a legend for naught!<br />Gerry Spence is not only a superlative legal tactician, for that alone he would not be what he is.  Gerry Spence is a wonderful storyteller and most of all one eminently gifted in the art of persuasion.  This is amply illustrated by the several books, including this one, authored by Mr. Spence.<br />&quot;Smoking Gun&quot; is a riveting story of how a little guy (actually, a woman) and her son was rescued from the ugly jaws of the law enforcement and legal establishment of the Lincoln County, Oregon.  And how the heroic efforts of a small, dedicated team had made a small difference in the American legal jungle, yet a life-and-death difference to an innocent, nameless woman and her son, struggling to live a simple life.<br />&quot;Smoking Gun&quot; is a sobering story of why we should never develop a complacency over those vested in state power.  Prosecutorial excesses and prosecutorial misconduct may not be widespread, but when that hideous force visits upon an ordinary citizen, it crushes him!  It is for this reason, among others, why we must be vigilant against the concentration and abuse of power, especially state power - I mean even faced with the menace of terrorism.<br />I like Gerry Spence.  I think he is believable.  However, I am never comfortable I get the whole picture with only one side of the story, compelling though it certainly is.  I wish someone knowledgeable in this rather high profile case would offer a challenge of some sort - a book may be, so that that matter can be seen from another light.<br />I like Gerry Spence also because he is a liberal in ideals but he does not embrace the despicable tactics that are the standard fares of most other high profile liberals.  Although I don't always agree with him on issues (I am not a liberal), I can hear him speaking from his heart why he wanted us not to cut down an old grove tree...<br />&quot;Smoking Gun&quot; is written like a novel.  It is very well written and a joy to read.	2003-10-22

He predicts the rise of Europe to counterweigh the United States in a bi-polar world.<br />Predicting the future is a risky business.  Luckily, whereas those who made the right predictions are anxious to remind others, as for those who were way off, hardly anybody remembers or cares.  This book, in my judgment, belongs to the latter heap.<br />It is true that America will not forever be far stronger than the rest of the world economically, militarily, technologically, and culturally.  Not only is this unsustainable, it is simply not good for the America and for the world to have such an permanent and pronounced imbalance.  But unless we screw up big time (and there are barbarians within the gate who try very hard to screw ourselves up!), America will be a strong leader for many generations.  American should welcome a strong Europe, a strong Asia, and America should welcome any country or groups of country to be strong, as long as they are peaceful.  That said, Europe can never be integrated like America, people who speak different languages and have deep differences in their culture will not function well under the same political and legal system except sustained by force, nor will they trust each other enough to give up their own defenses.  On the other hand, the English-speaking world will always be a reliable alliance in times of crisis.<br />Drawing parallel from history to make future predictions surely sounds rational.  However, historic parallels are more often than not superficial.  The Roman Empire fell chiefly because of the rot from within, but also because the empire was an overextension of an empire covering disparate people and cultures.  The decline of the British Empire was also inevitable because of the same reasons.  America has never built an empire with our military might and we should be vigilant not to allow politicians to do that.  Wedo have a large contingent of liberals who are intent on weakening those institutions that make our country and our people strong.  What do they do?  They creatively interpret our Constitution; they appoint judges who make laws at the bench; they encourage immigrants to not learn English; they teach our children to equivocate right and wrong; they fan class envy; they agitate the race and gender divides, and they intimidate and silence their critics, they even hijacked the term &quot;liberal&quot; to describe themselves.  These liberals are the barbarians I alluded to earlier.  America's decline, when and if it irrevocably happens, would be due to the liberal's good work, and NOT the rise of Europe.	2003-10-13

It is after reading Ann Coulter's \\"Treason\\", that I decided to read it to get a good understanding of Whittaker Chambers and the Alger Hiss Case.  And I ended up doing this on the double: I also read Sam Tanenhaus's biography of Chambers: \\"Whittaker Chambers.\\"<br />\\"Witness\\" was a moving account of how one person, who endured a disastrous childhood and adolescence in a dysfunctional family, was attracted to the liberal thinking, eagerly sought to become a communist, went through wrenching mental struggles with respect to communist ideology and methodology, eventually broke with the party and its underground apparatus, re-established himself in \\"respectable\\" society, and finally made a determination to expose communist infiltration of the U.S. government, culminating in his pivotal role in the trials and conviction of his friend Alger Hiss.  <br />Many people have said this:  Whittaker Chambers was a complex person.  Indeed he was.<br />\\"Witness\\" was essentially truthful, albeit somewhat self-serving.  It was filled with vivid details of Chambers's thought processes and gives a rather nuanced (although far from complete) portrayal of the communists, the \\"open party\\" as well as the underground (espionage) apparatus.  Except for some minor points, Chambers's account of his life up to that point was fairly independently collaborated by Sam Tanenhaus's biography of Chambers. I say \\"fairly independently\\" because Tanenhaus referenced \\"Witness\\" quite copiously. <br />There were so some intentional omissions in \\"Witness\\" that are not altogether immaterial, however.  Chambers did not disclose in his book that he had strong homosexual tendencies and had engaged in habitual homosexual acts for a period of time, even though he had made testimonial depositions to that effect.  In fact, in \\"Witness\\", one gets the impression that he regarded his adversaries' insinuation of his homosexuality as a baseless attack.  Another omission was that Chambers, in his youth, was apprehended for stealing significant number of books from two libraries, and was barred from them. These issues later emerged as a strike against him during the Hiss trials.  A third, perhaps most significant \\"omission\\" was that Chambers consistently claimed that the reason he withheld the evidence of espionage was because he wanted to shield Hiss and his family from being prosecuted for that much more serious crime.  The truth of the matter is that Chambers was also shielding himself from the same crime.  These omissions are quite understandable and it is probably normal for autobiographers to gross over some warts and scars.  In my judgment, considering the overall proportionality, they do not impair the value and truthfulness of \\"Witness.\\"  <br />To get the whole story, however, the reader is strongly recommended to also read Tanenhaus's book.  Besides putting Chambers life story in a more neutral footing, with warts and all, Tanenhaus's book also gave a much more detailed version of the proceedings of the Hiss trials, as well as some interesting facets of Chambers's life after the Hiss conviction, in particular the writing and publication of \\"Witness\\", his friendship with William Buckley, Jr., and the gradual, mellowing shift of his political thinking in his last years away from the extreme right.  Also, Tanenhaus's book added some new material, which surfaced years later, that tend to put Alger Hiss's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br />Back to Chambers's \\"Witness\\", it is a captivating story written with a superb writing style and a perfect mastery of the English language.  And because of the unusually variegated life Chambers had lived, which touched many big events and big names in mid-century American history and with the backdrop of the epic ideological debate, it is hard to overstate the stylistic and substantive values of this book.	2003-10-10

It is particularly useful as a supplement to Chambers's own story: \\"Witness.\\"<br />Tanenhaus's biography of Whittaker Chamber was written with a deliberately neutral stance, although collaborated well with Chambers's own story.  It was backed by copious and meticulous research, and filled in more than a few gaps.  <br />The most notable gaps in \\"Witness\\" included Chambers's strong [same sex] tendencies and his having engaged in habitual [same sex]  acts for a period of time, even though he had made testimonial depositions to that effect.  In fact, in \\"Witness\\", the reader gets the impression that Chambers regarded his adversaries' insinuation of his [alternative lifestyle] as a baseless attack.  Another omission was that Chambers, in his youth, was apprehended for stealing significant number of books from two libraries, and was barred from them. These issues later emerged as a strike against him during the Hiss trials.  A third, perhaps most significant \\"omission\\" was that Chambers in his own book consistently claimed that the reason he withheld the evidence of espionage was because he wanted to shield Hiss and his family from being prosecuted for a much more serious crime.  The truth of the matter was that Chambers was also shielding himself from the same crime.  Tanenhaus's book provided these facets, which Chambers would rather not get into.<br />Tanenhaus's book also gave a much more nuanced version of the proceedings of the Hiss trials, including defense lawyer Stryker's courtroom rhetoric and the sparring on the Woodstock typewriter.  As well, there were some interesting facets of Chambers's life after the Hiss trial, in particular the writing and publication of \\"Witness\\", his declining health, his support of and eventual distancing from Senator Joseph McCarthy, his friendship with the up-and-coming William Buckley, Jr., and the gradual, mellowing shift of his political thinking in his last years away from the extreme right.  Also, Tanenhaus's book added some new material regarding the accusation, which surfaced after the cold war, that tend to put Alger Hiss's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br />Although not as riveting as \\"Witness\\", this book more than held its own in terms of style, pace, clarity, completeness, and analytic insight.  Tanenhaus also tried hard to maintain a sense of neutrality on a person as complex and controversial as Whittaker Chambers.  I am quite willing to regard \\"Whittaker Chambers\\" as the definitive portrayal of the person, and definitive assessment of the Hiss Case.	2003-10-10

In less than 200 pages, Johnson gave the Renaissance a most delightful treatment.  <br />This book will disappoint those who try to look for exhaustive treatment of any area of literature and art of that fabulous era, or of any of the fabled masters.  But it delights the reader with a short tour of the Renaissance Italy (and to a lesser degree, Europe) by vivid illustrations of some of the most outstanding literary, architecture and artistic accomplishments and the personalities behind them.<br />A most valuable part of this small volume is its casting of the Renaissance in a historical and geographical context.  What brought about this marvelous revival of high arts?  How was it related to the Gothic tradition?  How some &quot;imported&quot; technologies, such as the movable type printing press from Germany and the oil paint from the Low Countries, were enthusiastically adopted by the Italians in propagating ideas and revolutionizing art forms. How the guild system produced successive generations of artists and also contemporaneous competition.  Roles played by local politics and art patrons, and, of course, the church.  And how eventually the French and German invasions from the north undermined the power foundation of this spectacular flowering of the arts, while ushering in the era of Reformation and the Baroque.<br />As a short history book - rather than a subject matter book - I find it informative, illuminating and well worth a couple of evening's reading time.	2003-07-22

This Book Is The Best Answer	Paul Johnson writes in a unique style.  Many say his style is quirky, but I think his way of writing history is really the best.  My reading his book is like being taken to a month-long tour of the early nineteenth century, mostly to England and Europe, but also to other parts of the world - American, Australia, Latin America and Asia - by virtue of the English (mostly) influence.  It was like waking up in the morning and reading the morning paper of the era, learning about the what were unfolding in politics, business, industry, literature, music, art, science, and even gossip as they happened.<br />In this 1000 page volume, Johnson tells how the modern society rapidly took shape in a relatively short period of time after the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte.  It is an interesting and compelling thesis.  The industrial revolution, which created a lot of \\"self-made\\" men, and the arrival of the white men to all continents with their modern morals and superior weapons, the emergence of science, the popularization of music, art, communication media and eventually politics, all interacted to bring about an era of politics of the masses, or democracy, in the West. <br />Johnson tells us that this was not just another period of progress. It was the birth of the modern society. After reading his book, I am inclined to agree.  Many of the salient features of today's society first took shape then.  From little ills like traffic jams and parking tickets, for example, which started with increasing number of horse carriages, to party politics fanned by the media, newly juiced up by the steam-powered printing press.  As if he anticipated what would happen in September 2000, at the ending pages of the book, Johnson innocuously chronicled the invention of the Lucifer match, a godsend for housewives but which also spawned arson.  Does that not sound like a foretaste of terrorists and weapons of mass destruction?<br />The Birth of the Modern is a very unique history book.  It is well worth your time.   It gives meaning to the author's famous quote: \\"The study of history is a powerful antidote to contemporary arrogance. It is humbling to discover how many of our glib assumptions, which seem to us novel and plausible, have been tested before, not once but many times and in innumerable guises; and discovered to be, at great human cost, wholly false.\\" <br />It is the best answer to anyone who might ask why we should study history.	2003-06-18

As a result, schools were inundated with advocates, programs and teaching material that treated little boys as suspect criminals, doing grave harm to their development. <br />The \\"gender feminists\\" are not swayed by the facts presented by Christina Hoff Sommers in \\"The War Against Boys\\", and earlier in \\"Who Stole Feminism?\\"  They did not debate what she wrote; they attack her instead.  Centuries ago, Bishop Bellamine refused to look through Galileo's telescope; he prosecuted him instead.  Such are those who play the game of faith.<br />This book puts a magnifying glass on one facet of the harms done by the radical left:  how the gender feminists used frivolous theories to support programs and practices that demise the development of boys, and their dishonesty in this pursuit.  It is well researched and well written.  Sommers treats you to some fantasy theories, to cite just one:<br />New born babies do not know anything about gender, and gender identities are therefore not innate but taught.  Sommers: babies don't know anything about blood types either, but they still have one.  <br />It never ceases to amaze me how these advocacy or junk \\"scientists\\", many of whom have lofty credentials - PhD, directors, and what not - are engaged in literal intellectual fraud rather than honest scientific inquiry.  In a few cases, Sommers takes the readers through their research data (where they made it available) and their interpretation, one sees that such research is virtually worthless, because it doesn't meet even the minimal standards of statistical inference and causation analysis.<br />We need more people like Christine Hoff Sommers, who use a cool-headed approach to expose the intellectual dishonesty that is so pervasive in the social scene.	2003-04-14

In the campuses of the institutions of American higher education, from the Ivy League to community colleges, the First Amendment and had given way to political correctness. The spirit of liberty - freedom of expression and freedom of academic inquiry, was under senseless assault. Students and faculties alike were silenced by speech codes, intimidated and persecuted by secret kangaroo judicial apparatus controlled by radical liberals, save a few brave souls such as Kors and Silverglate.<br />Kors and Silverglate barely lifted a rock so huge by a crack as to allow us to see some of the ugliness underneath. The university administrators proclaimed their allegiance to academic freedom, but in the same breath denounced \\"offensive\\" expressions. What an irony! And nothing is offensive when it is directed against conservative values; everything is offensive when one is not in concert with the race and gender radicals. The blatant double standard insults one's intelligence.<br />The casualties have been heavy. Countless students and faculty members succumbed to this onslaught. Many were silenced or coerced to admit to false charges. Some suffer much greater losses such as expulsion (students) and termination (faculty), without any semblance of due process.<br />Why do most universities keep their disciplinary proceedings secret? Anything that has to be kept secret is highly suspect. And, of course, when one is brave and resourceful enough to take the matter to a court of law, the administrators run for cover. <br />This book is very well researched and equally well written. (I love historians, they are such good prose writers.) I myself have been considerably educated by it on the subject of the interpretation of the First and the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Court's ginger handling of academic freedom.<br />As the author said \\"Sunlight is the best disinfectant.\\" This book is sunlight. Great work.	2003-03-25

The book is really about how politicians deceive the American people by concealing, withholding and misrepresenting information - in short, by lying, and how decades of growth of government power has resulted in such entrenched bureaucracy, power base, incentive structure and dumbing-down of the public, that the trend is practically irreversible, short of a revolt - according to the author.<br />Reading this book tries one's patience. The author apparently has not thought through who her audience was, whether it was her academia cohort or the broader reading public. She uses economics jargons where simple words would quite suffice; she uses the term \\"transaction cost\\" in almost every sentence in the first chapters and it makes you think that a robot is talking to you. Then again, she makes the same points over and over again, paragraph after paragraph.<br />To her credit, the author has chosen a worthwhile subject and has done meticulous research. And she does offer some valuable insights. This book is for you if you are seriously interested in the history of the administrative state and an analysis of the underpinning political dynamics, and do not mind the rather tiresome style of presentation.	2003-02-21

Think Again!	This rather unassuming book is one of great import.  When the same book is endorsed by Milton Friedman and Alan Dershowitz on the same page, it is one not to be taken lightly.<br />The book started off with the cornerstone pieces of the Anglo-Saxon law - mens rea (criminal intent), non-retroactiveness of new laws, presumption of innocence until proven guilty, sanctity of attorney-client privilege, property rights, and went on to cite laws and legal cases, some of the very high-profile, that helped chip away the these cornerstone pieces and made the law no longer a guarantor of constitutional rights.  This dangerous practice of eroding the \\"Right of the Englishman\\" is, according to the authors, a result of well-intended, but poorly thought-out legislation and over zealous government prosecutors, who were driven by political ambition, pressure of revenue and even personal enrichment.<br />It is frightening development.  It is hard to believe that this country has allowed its cherished legal system to deteriorate to one that, in essence, is no different than that of a police state - one that prosecutors could at will use the full force of the government to break any individual, sometimes by threats, lies and confiscations.  Most people will dismiss this notion as alarmist, until they read what this book has explained and chronicled.  After 9/11, the Ashcroft regime seeks to greatly enlarge federal powers to fight terrorism, but that inevitably be at the expense of our cherished civil liberty.  We should all be vigilant about what is being done.  History has taught us that some really bad things that are done with good intentions are very, very hard to undo.<br />Reading this book forces me to revise my opinion on those who had been vilified by the prosecutors and the media, like Charles Keating, Jr. Leona Hemsley and Michael Milken; as well it dims the much-heralded Rudolph Giuliani legacy.  It also reconfirms that damages done by FDR's New Deal - the emergence of theadministrative state, and his Court-packing initiative, not to speak of the unleashing of the welfare state.<br />The presentation of the book, unfortunately, seems to lack clarity and force, and the organization is somewhat loose.  There are anecdotes abound, but they are not backed by statistics, and the reader has no idea if the outrageous prosecutorial excesses are 10% of the cases, 1%, or less.   The book is otherwise very readable.  I will recommend this book if only for the seriousness of the subject matter.	2003-02-09

She is given to exaggerations and rather inflammatory rhetoric, not a style I particularly like.  But this book is surprisingly good.  Her hyperbolic style notwithstanding, this book is a well structured for the points she is to make and she proffers an impressive portfolio of evidence and statistics to illustrate and prove those points.  I am impressed with her critical thinking and analysis.  As well I should be, she is an attorney and it shows.  She is amply good at sourcing and presenting evidence to prove her points and does so beyond reasonable doubt.<br />Those points are that the liberals control the media and use it to slander conservative politicians with lies, name-calling, censorship, biased portrayals, and outright attacks while fawning on liberal democrats.  The liberals, Coulter contents, have no respect for the facts and would do anything to win.<br />Needless to say, this book is one-sided, which means that the facts, data, etc., are all selected to support her thesis.  Nonetheless, those who disagree with her seem to choose to attack her person and her motive instead of trying to debate her by proffering counter evidence or noting errors in her book.  Could it be that, as Ann Coulter herself says in the book, that the liberals just can't, because they don't have the facts with them?<br />After reading this book, I am inclined to revise my opinion of her.  Those exaggerations are still there.  But, like a good lawyer, she does her homework very well, and she writes with clarity and force, generous with wit and humor.  Coulter's well-researched accounts left the liberals no place to hide.  &quot;Slander&quot; is both informative and entertaining.	2003-01-02

This very readable book addresses the mass audience on a serious subject of media bias and to debunk the ultra-liberal litany that has saturated the broadcast network and the \\"mainstream\\" print media, and at the same time offers an alternative, positive outlook for the vast captive constituency of the Victicrats. <br />Elder's book covers much ground on the socio-political landscape.  He exposes what is oftentimes craftily hidden from news stories.  One striking example captured in this book: to what length would a liberal go to deceive his audience?  Just listen to Stephan Schneider, and environment \\"scientist\\", who famously said, and defended \\"...we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have...Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest.\\"  I am sure the reader will be able to come up with a much less torturous sentence by using a three-letter verb.<br />Elder devotes a good portion of this book to address the predicament of the black and Hispanic communities.  Elder himself is one of the many many examples of how the right set of values, role models and hard work and perseverance can bring success to people despite formidable adversity.  Of course, success manifest in many ways; few people, regardless of race, are able to achieve to the level of Larry Elder.  He, along with Thomas Sowell, Alan Kayes, Walter Williams, Clarence Thomas, and many whose name I might not be familiar, are great heroes and role models for blacks (and indeed for all of us.)	2002-12-16

Drawing on his own formidable knowledge base and a wealth of source material vast and deep, his account of key historical events are fascinating, often accompanied by interesting and obscure details, such as private conversations between the key figures, contemporaneous commentaries, evidences recovered long after an event, etc., which are not on pages of most history books.<br /><br />Everyone who reads this book will discern the author's conservative undertone, although that tone has not interfered with the truthful presentation of historical events. Johnson does not only narrate; throughout the book, he quite liberally offers his own interpretation and causation analysis of events, and his assessment of the movers and shakers of their times. This conservative undertone, I must say, is Johnson's trademark.  Johnson expresses his own sentiment judiciously and lets the reader judge his views along with his work.<br /><br />His conservative sentiments notwithstanding, I find Paul Johnson to be, first of all, credible, and then also balanced in his treatment of issues. (By balanced, I don't mean not taking sides; I mean presenting both sides.) Quite distinct from the ideologically predisposed, Johnson does not pull punches, even with figures he professedly admires.<br /><br />This is the second book of Paul Johnson's that I read, the first being \\"Intellectuals\\". I enjoyed both books tremendously. Although I am not as incensed as some reviewers about his liberal use of foreign phrases, titles and quotes within the text, often without English translation, I AM mildly annoyed by it. Overall, I highly recommend this book. Ifind it to be the most impressive of narrative history books. You will find it an excellent investment of your reading time.	2002-12-03

Paul Johnson takes on a line-up of first class intellectuals spanning three centuries, and declares: Beware Intellectuals.<br />By shining a bright light on the dark side of these very public figures - on their greed, their lust and promiscuity, their deceit and arrogance, and especially the despicable way they treated those around them, including and especially their spouse and children while proclaiming selfless love for humanity, Johnson made a strong case on how only human these luminaries truly were.  And posed the question as to how fit intellectuals really were in preaching to others how they should manage their affairs.<br />You will find an idol or two of yours deflated as you read Johnson's well-researched book.  Some would argue that the merits of a man's ideas are independent of the man himself.  This is certainly true with scientific ideas (or theories), which can be empirically validated.  Albert Einstein, Edward Teller, or even James Watson were not necessarily what one wants for close friends, but one would not reject the theories of relativity, thermonuclear reaction and the double-helical structure of DNA for the personal failings of these scientists.  On the other hand, one must wonder aloud the value of the social theories proclaimed by the intellectuals who somehow saw their theories fit for the masses but not for themselves!<br />Perhaps this book is one-sided.  It mostly picked on the leftists.  I am afraid the raw statistics are also quite one-sided.  It is the vision of the left to see themselves as an anointed group who are destined to \\"run things\\" to make a better world.  Regardless, I am inclined to think that the intellectuals on the right are just as hypocritical, if fewer in number.  <br />One key point well argued in this book is that the talent of people in one area, which renders them famous, does not give them license to mentor mankind in all affairs.  One sees this folly everyday with many Hollywood and other media celebrities. <br />\\"Intellectuals\\" is a joy to read. While Johnson harshly critiqued the dark side of these intellectuals, he also presented them in the proper historical context and gave due to the epochal importance of their work where it was appropriate.  Johnson's writing style was graceful and engaging.  Like a good historian, he was meticulous with facts and data, which, though selected to support his thesis, were factual nonetheless.  This book, besides being informative, has given me quite a refreshed perspective on intellectuals.  It is one of those books that you read and think about again and again because it is rightly provocative.	2002-10-30

I think he was right about that.  At some point, a combination of righteousness and frustration would drive a person to the point of desperation wanting to be heard, even at a high cost.  Goldberg did a good job with the op-ed.  He made a valid point.  He pointed out the obvious.  His credentials also provided high-power ammunition to the networks' critics.<br />So, good job Bernie.  Just please don't whine about being put in the dog house.  Not that you deserve to be, but, seriously, what else do you expect? <br />Bias is mostly a small vendetta on the CBS news operations, specially targeting Dan Rather and Andrew Heyward.  If you enjoy exposé by an insider, this book is reasonably good specimen.  It is written with wit and filled with interesting details.  Quite frankly, although the details are interesting-being able to listen to what one is not privy to is always interesting-but none of it is at all surprising.  The media bias is so obvious, so in-your-face, that it needs no one to point out!  What Goldberg has told in this book is entertaining rather than enlightening.<br />I had a couple of enjoyable evening reading this book.	2002-10-14

This universality begs an explanation, and that explanation is found in the difference in the hormonal systems of the two sexes, starting with the hormonal musculinization of the male at the fetal stage.<br />Simple and convincing to some, this theory is anathema to the politically correct crowd, especially the \\"feminists.\\"  Thus the earlier version of the book had a dubious honor of being the book rejected (by publishers) the most times that was eventually published.  After publishing, furious critics came out and slam the book, predictably.<br />Also predictable, however, was that the critics were mostly political debaters cloaked behind the veritable titles of professors and such, who attempted to discredit Goldberg's theory by rhetoric and muddled logic. Goldberg gave several examples of these professorial arguments and they were downright ....  One would burst out in laughter, for example, after reading the \\"haggis\\" argued by professor Fausto-Sterling, or the evasiveness of the Lowontin, Rose and Kamin trio, to mention just two.<br />Goldberg spends a lot of energy to answer his critics and in doing so, he literally elevate it into a science.  This book is thus also a good course in debunking muddled logic-the confusion of a physical law and a statistical claim, the confusion of cause and effect, the \\"glancing blow\\" of attacking the excess to discredit the core, the \\"red herring\\", and all forms of misrepresentations and flawed logic can find examples in the critics' arguments.<br />If one accepts the scientific method of inquiry, one has to give credence to Goldberg's theory.  As the author wrote: \\"Empirical analysis in sensitive areas invariably elicits fear, fear that acceptance of its conclusion will compel an unpalatable moral or political position...such fear is never relevant to the correctness of the feared theory...\\"<br />My criticism of this book is on the writing style.  Goldberg wrote out his theory and arguments in a style similar to that of a mathematical proof.  As a result, the book is littered with long and windy sentences, covering multiple situations, conditions and pre-established fact, in order to make a point.  It requires considerable concentration to follow his long and complex sentences.  Perhaps because Goldberg is in a position of answering his critics, he is extremely careful in laying out his arguments, and clarifying what he says, what he means, and what he does or does not argue or imply.  In a nutshell, the book is quite tedious to read.<br />The concluding part \\"The Meaning of Male and Female\\" with a lone chapter is a refreshing exception.  It is polished, thoughtful, and it brings the reader back to the real life of the office and the family living room to illustrate how the stereotypical roles of the sexes have worked to the advantage of society and, indeed, to the survival of the specie.<br />This book is not exactly pleasure reading and is not for the casual reader.  However, except for the ideologically predisposed, it settles the issue of sexual difference in behavioral tendencies.	2002-09-25

It is not a textbook; it is a polemic, if you will.  Regardless, the material in the book is so well chosen and the argument so clearly made that I highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to be an informed citizen.<br />The media elite would have you believe that to be \\"informed\\" is to simply subject yourself to 15 minutes of sound bites every day or reading through the headlines of the newspaper.  After reading this book, and you will never take at face value what the political pundits deliver.<br />A simple example from this book: basic economics dictate that farm subsidies drive up prices of farm products and creates hardship for the poor.  However, by voting for large farm subsidies AND food stamps for the poor, the politicians got two \\"constituency\\" vote blocks loyal to them.  Over time, these policies sculpt a webwork of entitlements.  Guess who pay for it?<br />One reviewer disagrees with Sowell and argues that the Scandinavian countries have a higher standard of living than the United States \\"by almost every quantifiable standard\\" such as life expectancy, infant mortality rate,etc.  Well, in order to provide these social benefits, Swedes pay 75%(!) of their income for unemployment insurance, and when they buy something, they pay an astonishing 25% national sales tax, and the Swedish government is running a deficit consistently several times higher as a percentage of GDP compared with the U.S.  Moreover, the tax burden is so high and the incentive to work so low, that the Scandinavian social welfare systems are on the verge of financial collapse!   And the Swedish politicians know it.<br />This also makes me think of what Einstein said: \\"Not everything that counts can be counted; not everything that can be counted counts.\\"  What the Scandinavian folks have less is freedom.  Most of their basic needs are taken care of through very high taxation.  But if ones want to get anything other than \\"basic\\", something different - simple things like imported foodstuff, you pay out-of-the-earth prices.  Most people therefore do mostly \\"necessary\\" things and do them mostly the same way.  Instead of looking to the market for answers, they look to the government.  In Sweden, for example, because the government essentially pays for child rearing through public education and other subsidies such as food and health care, children are increasingly regarded as charges of the state, and there are laws that govern how children must be raised as (for example, spanking a child is illegal.)  The free market is not perfect, but it is the imperfection that makes progress possible, and hence makes it the best system there is.<br />Basic Economics is not Sowell's best book, but it is very readable for the general audience.  After reading this book I gave a copy to my teenage son.  I want him get a no-nonsense course on basic economics, so he can make up his mind on important issues with more than just sound bites, headlines, and classroom indoctrination.	2002-09-11

According to People's History of the United States, this country is a bad country, conceived and built by bad people with bad motives, did nothing but bad things throughout its history, and continues to infest the world with bad things and bad ideas to this day.<br />If one wants to write about bad things in a democracy, he should know two things: 1.

To claim that different people have different levels of intelligence runs counter to the cherished notion that all men are created equal.  However, empirical evidence is overwhelming that every human being is not born with equal potential.<br />Some people do not like the findings of scientific studies because the findings undermine the premises of their belief, and they tend to attack and discredit the scientist and impugn his motive.  Others may not like the findings but accept them if they are satisfied that the findings are the results of scientific methods.  This book appeals to the latter group, as the professor was very meticulous in explaining the hypothesis, the experiment, the data, and the analysis.  He was very candid about what he was sure and what he was not so sure and why.<br />I learned a lot about the subject of human intelligence from this book.  More importantly, as I read this book, I could see that even as the professor pursues the subject with uncommon vigor, he is also a healthy all-around skeptic and would not rest until all arguments, including &quot;rival&quot; ideas, have been thought through.  For this reason, I believe what I learned is the best knowledge to date of the subject.<br />If you are seriously interested in the subject of mental abilities, there is frankly no substitute to this book.	2002-08-21

This title of this book is an alluring theme but the book is, upon reading, virtually worthless.  The analogy between a natural ecosystem and an economic system is clear enough and certainly not an earthshaking discovery - the rhythms, cycles, feedback mechanisms, etc., of any dynamic system are obvious similarities.  But try to draw too much parallel between a natural system and a man-made system will inevitably lead to meaningless conclusions.<br />The author proposes a theory and then cites real-world examples that conform to that theory, sometimes rather forcibly.  One example:  In a section on information, the author said that the Indian auto industry was protected by high tariffs and that it led to its stagnation and decline.  The author claimed that it was because the industry \\"failed to encourage the use of information.\\"  Anyone with the slightest knowledge of free market knows that lack of competition was the real cause.  Does the rainforest add anything?<br />At another point, the author pondered on how the eye was (or was not) the result of evolution, and after postulating that incremental evolution was not possible for certain very complex biological structures (such as the eye), he cites the new notions of \\"intelligent design\\" and \\"downward causation\\".  High sounding names, but how do they come about now?? Well, intelligent design must be because evolution is not...As to downward causation, it is, as illustrated by the rainforest, a series of adaptation.  Wow, I thought that was evolution.<br />There was also a lengthy tirade denouncing the Wintel platform's dominance \\"threatening the infospace.\\"  This was taken right out of the annals of the cyberspace sour grapes.<br />Finally, although the author tries to appear apolitical and centrist, his liberal bias was all too clear - from his dismissive comments about Dick Cheney to his proposal of (government?) setting rules on how software must be created to be modular, with open interface, etc., etc.  Whew!<br />This book was recommended by a number of big name business people, whose businesses got a fair bit of free PR from this book.  My recommendation: waste neither money nor time on this book.  Do enjoy the rainforest, but learn your business skills by studying the free market instead.	2002-08-08

Given the controversy generated by this book, it is hard to assess the book without referencing the criticisms piled on it.<br />Many reviewers alluded to the fact that many critical and repudiating reviews of the book were from scientific journals. This on the surface commands credence. However, taking a deeper look into this matter reveals something quite different.<br />The science of the environmental studies, mostly conducted in college campuses and in concert with scientific publications, was virtually taken over by the advocate scientists, whereas the old fashion fact-finding scientists have all been silenced. Lomborg's book is an exposé on the political agenda of the advocate scientists, their shoddy work and outrageous claims. It is small wonder that loud squeals are heard from the \\"scientific\\" community. Their integrity, their competency, and their raison d'être, no less, are being openly questioned!<br />Reading into some of the refutations (I read a fair number them all, including the ones from Scientific American), one would find a profusion of rhetoric, patronizing and denunciations, but very few actual errors they could cite in Lomborg's book. These criticisms are generally along the lines that Lomborg was a statistician and not a natural scientist, that the issue is \\"more complicated\\", or that Lomborg drew conclusions without looking what was happening in the \\"developing\\" nations, or that Lomborg selected data to support his claims. (Of course, Lomborg, like anyone else, selects data. But he gave source of the data and also compared data from different sources and explained why a set of data is more credible and/or more consistent with observed facts.)<br />Even the condescending criticism of Lomborg confusing production with consumption about the ocean was not right.  It is customary to refer to the rate of yield from a land or an ocean, or a worker or a machine for that matter, as its productivity.  The ocean is not a consumer; human beings are.Human beings could not have harvested and consumed the fish if the oceans have not produced them.  The question is whether that productivity can be sustained.  If this productivity had been on an upward trend for thirty years, and is now double what it was in 1970, Lomborg was quite correct in making that claim.  I would not argue that there has not been over-harvesting or depletion over the years.  When they happen, feedback mechanisms, natural, economic and legal, will kick in to stop or correct them.<br />Having read both sides, it is clear to me which side is more objective and credible. ...	2002-08-02

Her third and (probably) last book offers a view to the principles and logic behind the policies and actions that led to the revival of the British nation and in partnership with Ronald Reagan the triumph over communism.<br />I deduce that the people who have had the most influence on Margaret Thatcher were Adam Smith, Winston Churchill and Friedrich von Hayek. Accordingly she is motivated primarily by three things: love of freedom, love of Britain, and an unshakable belief in capitalism.  These themes resonate throughout the book.  She also admits to special kindred for America and also the English-speaking people, disdain for the modern day socialists (a.k.a. left-wing liberals) and a strong, reasoned aversion for the European super-state project.<br />At this point in her political life, Lady Thatcher sees no need to be politically correct.  In fact, she seems to find it her duty to speak with candor about many thorny issues that serving politicians of like minds simply can't.  For example, she spoke of Americans having a easily troubled conscience, and with due respect to the drafters of the Declaration of Independence, that of all men (and women) are NOT created equal, and that women are better wielding handbags than bayonets, etc., etc.  These statements, although self-evident even freestanding, are quoted without context here.  When you read the book, you will find many similarly candid assessments as she sorted through issues ranging from the pound sterling to global warming.<br />This book is memoir in nature; as such, not much of it is entirely original.  However, in this one volume, she covers with depth practically every key issue of the current political horizon in all key regions of the world, with both accurate historical context and her own insightful analysis and conclusions.<br />This is genuine stuff from a genuinely great statesman.   It is a rare opportunity to study how this \\"grocer's daughter\\" analyzed complex national and international issues and made high-stake decisions that made history, and shares her wisdom with a new generation of world leaders.  It is a very enjoyable read.  You would not want to miss it.	2002-07-11

Islam And The West is a serious dissertation not so much of the Muslim culture and Islam faith, which are very large subjects, but how one should even attempt to understand them.  This is a short, but very substantial book.<br />The author points out that many popular interpretations and beliefs about Islam, which are common currency in the Christian West, are actually incorrect.  Still more notions which are common in the West have no real equivalents in the Islamic paradigm.  <br />It is not hard to see, with a deep understanding of the Islam faith and the Muslim culture, that many \\"commonsense\\" formulations of, say, the Palestinian solution, simply won't work, or why most people could not comprehend the Islamic Revolution (actions of the Ayatollah Khomeini and his followers,) or of the Taliban.  This is simply because the Islamic faith is not comparable to the Christian or Judaic faith, the Islamic state is not equivalent to the Western state, or any other state, for that matter, and that the Islamic teaching is central and all encompassing to the purpose in life of the \\"fundamentalist\\" Muslim.  Our faith in such fundamental concepts as patriotism, peaceful co-existence, trade, and a good many others are either non-existent or even forbidden in the Islamic mind.  Use of these concepts in formulating political solutions in that part of the world will inevitably fail.<br />Islam And The West is a must-read for politicians, journalists, scholars and ordinary Joes like myself, who have a serious interest in the Middle East issues.  Besides the high quality of the studies presented, Bernard Lewis's writing style, especially with his careful choice of words, and elegantly crafted sentences, surely has helped make this book a classic.	2002-07-01

But I must after reading several essays in this book.<br />The First Amendment is not an absolutist rule for all occasions. It is a compact between our government and us as to how the State may not make laws to abridge the freedom of speech, the free exercise of religion, etc.<br />The First Amendment protects ideas, in the sense that a citizen cannot be prosecuted for advancing an idea, however unpopular. It clearly does not sanction all acts of expressing an idea. The government does not allow a person to express his hate of another by murdering him, for example. So, freedom of expression, important as it is, does not trump everything else. (The hating person can distribute pamphlets or make a speech to denigrate his enemy. And that would be allowed by law.)<br />Further, the First Amendment's operative domain is the society at large, at the level of legislation and law-enforcement. Within an organization in that society, public or private, is not the place to practice First Amendment rights, unless that organization has adopted similar guidelines for its code of communication. An organization can and must set rules of governance in pursuit of the mission of the organization. The armed forces, for example, are a government, or public, organization. I doubt that a soldier should have the First Amendment rights to openly express his sympathy for the enemy at the time of combat, say by passing out pamphlets to glorify the enemy or to urge fellow soldiers not to fight a battle. Clearly, such expressions are protected by law within the society at large. Similarly, a school, even a public school, exists for the purpose of educating the young, those who are in charge of schools should and must set rules to ensure that the school is safe, effective, and its charge has good discipline. What those rules should be is open to debate, and even subject to administrative challenge. But I don't think that any person who is a member of a school, be he a teacher, or student, or whatever, even a teacher of the Constitution, can exercise his First Amendment rights as if the school were just open society. Anyone who violates a rule within the jurisdiction of an organization to express himself must be prepared to accept the consequence. Sometimes it makes the person a hero, other times it makes him an idiot, or even a criminal.<br />Finally, any organization that is in a position to allow, or disallow, a particular speech or a speaker in connection with its business must have the right to do that, that right to approve or disapprove is the First Amendment itself! The First Amendment guarantees the right to express; it does not guarantee approval by others. Disapproval within the confines of an organization is not the same as repudiation of the First Amendment exercisable in the society at large. The reputation of an organization is inevitably tied to what ideas that organization approves or disapproves of. The organization must certainly have the right to shape that. Whether it did the right thing or is up to others to judge.<br />So the glorification of a student who insisted on disregarding the rules of the school on the previewing of a speech, or the teacher who broke rules because of her fervent First Amendment belief, is misplaced. A government can, as seduced by good intention, use law or administrative power to take away the authority of organizations regarding rule making and enforcement. This good is purchased at the high cost of more government coercive power on how people may freely associate (or not.) Looking at the schools, one can see that taking away authority also takes away accountability. We have done too much of that and this is one reason why public school authorities cannot foster a disciplined environment.<br />The First Amendment is one of the most precious things we have in this country. We owe it to ourselves to understand it clearly and teach it correctly.to understand it clearly and teach it correctly.	2002-06-10

Another thing is that by scrutinizing what he wrote about one particular place that I happen to know very well, I can say that he captured the essence of the place quite masterfully in a dozen pages or so.

Timmerman's book is a great public service.  \\"Exposing the real Jesse Jackson\\" is a most appropriate subtitle. <br />You should read this book to see the exposed Jesse Jackson:<br />- a ruthless man who lied and cheated to promote himself and destroy those who spoke the truth about him.<BR>  <BR>- a talented con-artist who used gangster tactics, cronies, connections, and threats to amass a fortune and build a black family dynasty.  <br />- a greedy, self-serving opportunistic hustler who inflamed and exploited the race relationship to empower and enrich himself and his cronies.<br />But all of the above, revulsive as they are, are trivial - they are industry standard for politicians.  That is why no established politicians want or dare to tangle with him. Jesse Jackson's contorted success was no doubt helped by the politician's cowardice, the media bias, and Bill Clinton's patronage.<br />The real tragedy is that the \\"Reverend\\" Mr. Jackson has poisoned the race relationship in America, and by promoting a thesis that black's success depended on preferential treatment and their failure were due to racism, he mortgaged the character of his own people.  Poor blacks growing up with this man as their morale compass will get hopelessly lost.<br />Jesse Jackson is no Martin Luther King Jr.  He has nothing to do with civil rights.

Netanyahu concluded, quite convincingly, that the latter was what Israel can hope for in the foreseeable future, and hence it is essential for Israel to be powerful and constantly vigilant. <br />Though quite hawkish in tone, Netanyahu made an impressionable point that Israel's goal is for peaceful coexistence with, and not the subjugation of, its neighbors.  The return of the Sinai to Egypt in exchange for a peace treaty was cited as a powerful testimony.  Also, he candidly pointed out some of the shortcomings of the Israeli policies, as well as the diversity of opinions within the Israelis.<br />This book is admittedly one-sided in its selection of facts and data, but they are basically factual, if skillfully put through a prism to fit the former prime minister's thesis.  Overall, though, it is a very well written book - rich in material, logical in its analysis, powerful in its arguments, and witty in appropriate places to make reading interesting.  <br />This is one of several books I have read from various angles on this complex, controversial and immensely emotional and deadly conflict.  It may very well be regarded as an authoritative view from the Israeli point of view.  As such, this point of view must be fully appreciated by anyone, be it career politician or armchair guru, who wants to fathom an end to this conflict.  <br />A last word of caution:  you cannot get a fair and complete picture of this conflict by reading just one book or listening to just one voice.

In addition to the usual political and military litany, the book also places special emphasis on the social and economic aspects of the poignant Palestinian existence.  It is hard not to develop sympathy for the Palestinian people after reading this exposition of what they have gone through, and how much they have suffered in the 20th century.<br />I will also point out that this book presents a decidedly one-sided view.  Although the authors pointed out, and documented in considerable detail, the inherent problems within the Palestinian cause: deeply fractured leadership lacking consensus in regard to goals and means, embrace of violence, conflicts with the nationalist Arabic regimes, the incompetent and self-serving acts of their leader Yasser Arafat, etc., they (the authors) nonetheless put the lion's share of the blame on Israel.  They insisted on holding Israel to high standards of well-established Western democracies while Palestinian transgressions were given a gentle touch and often with historic and contemporaneous excuses.<br />I don't know if it is the Arab people, the Muslim culture, ideology, or just the desert wind, but even as the book's authors are high educated, cool-headed and analytical, they, and most vocal Palestinian supporters, seem to lack a few commonsense elements in their framework of thought and analysis:  a) When you are in a position of weakness, you don't hold on to a wish list and demand 100% satisfaction immediately. b) In this time and age, violence, especially terror visited on civilians will arouse anger and contempt rather than sympathy. c) Jews also suffered greatly historically, in fact much more than Palestinians.  Israeli leadership will not let stand any development that could jeopardize their security or diminish their ability to defend their country and their people.  Consider this:<br />In a conversation in between Benjamin Netayahu and Chinese premier Jiang Zemin, they noted that the Chinese, the Indians and the Jews are the three oldest peoples in the world.  Netayahu pointed out that there are 1.2 billions Chinese today, 1 billion Indians and only 12 million Jews, and asked the Chinese premier why.  The latter had no answer.  Netayahu then said, \\"...but they all boil down to one big thing.  You, the Chinese kept China; the Indians kept India. But the Jews lost our land and were dispersed into the four corners of the earth... culminating in our greatest catastrophe in the twentieth century...\\"<br />The similar tragedies of the two peoples (one historic and the other contemporary) suggest that rather than regarding Jews as their mortal enemy, the Palestinians may do well to emulate Jews instead: to educate their young, to build human capital in marketable skills (rather than martyrdom,) to be respectful of other people and cultures, and to work realistically with what you have.  Will the Palestinians ever see this kind of leadership vision?  The unfortunate fact is that most Middle East Muslims are still not done fighting the Crusaders.<br />Back to the book:  it is exceedingly informative, but you must also get the other point of view (and their selection of data) to understand the whole picture. I might add that many books on this controversial and emotional subject tend to be unavoidably one-sided or otherwise incomplete. The book is well written with a lucid style, and one of the best in presenting the Palestinian view, and deserves to be read by those who want to go beyond sound-bite politics.r country and their people.

Although the facts of many high profile cases were eventually known, such as the Kelly Flynn case, the Diallo case, the black church-burning drama, and the California Prop 209 vis-à-vis Ward Connelly case, etc., it was terribly disturbing to learn how the media had manipulated their news reporting to shape public opinion.  There are many other, both high and lower-profile cases that this book documented.  It is enough to make you wonder whether the flagship newspapers such as the NY Times, the LA Times, the Washington Post, etc, and the many broadcast networks, still have any sense of civic responsibility of reporting the facts.  Often in the book, the author wrote:\\" (the emergence of new evidence) again fell through the journalistic cracks.\\"  More accurately, it was carefully kept in the journalistic closet.<br />Many times, these major media outlets presented their spin on the front page when the news broke and when more facts emerged later that contradicted their view and, more importantly, their faith, they were frequently either ignored or given two paragraphs on page 34.  (I notice that a few conservative pundits do this also.)  The audience, I surmise, were largely left with the earlier, erroneous, impression.<br />It confirms what a lot of people have already sensed through their own experience with the major broadcast and print news media outlets.  I have not watched CBS for ages, and I am one, probably among many, who discontinued a several-decade-long subscription to my local metropolitan newspaper because I found it so biased in its reporting and commentary that has no value to me.  Instead, I look to various news sources on the Internet for information and draw my own conclusions.<br />Given the monotone of the subject and the fact that many of the examples and cases have in fact the same fabric and texture, the book comes across as tedious.  The research is meticulous and pounding is on the mark.  And if you don't mind the ideological undertone, it is worth a few evenings' reading time.	2002-04-21

Those of us who care about the environment are thankful for Lomborg's book.  It is a Herculean effort to compile and analyze this immense amount of data on so many fields to give us a rather dispassionate, but certainly much-closer-to-the-truth view on many environmental issues.<br />In the beginning of the book, Lomborg skillfully explained why most people believe that the environment is in bad shape by pointing out some interesting statistics:  most people believe that their own immediate sphere, a town or village, is in better shape environmentally than his country, and that his country is in better shape environmentally than the world at large.  (And similarly over 70% of drivers rate themselves as above-average drivers!) So, the \\"environment is in bad shape\\" is not a personal experience, but has been communicated to them.  Lomborg than correctly pointed out that incentive structure for the career environmental scientist/activist tilt them to communicate bad, or even alarmist, scenarios.  Basically, it is money (donations and government grants) and livelihood (career and fame.)  Similarly, the media is incented to communicate \\"news\\" that attracts a large viewership - the only real news is bad news.  .  <br />Lomborg's method is quite straightforward: present a \\"received wisdom\\" of some claim of crisis, provide some explanatory material and put the issue in context, then expose the claim as either having no data or evidence to back it up, or is soundly contradicted by subsequent, more authoritative data, or its prediction wildly off the mark.<br />This book documents how the \\"Silent Spring\\" never came to pass,  \\"Our Stolen Future\\" is actually quite secure, the \\"40,000 species loss per year\\" is utter fantasy, the \\"50% drop of the human sperm count\\" is not to diminish our manhood.  And there are many more...<br />I do not come away thinking that everything is rosy - it is not the message of this book.  Even though Lomborg does not have any startling new discovery to share, I certainly feel that his work is most valuable, and he is much more objective and credible than Paul Ehrlich, Lester Brown and other luminaries who have made a career of making outrageous (and wrong) predictions of environmental disasters year after year. <br />Lomborg's point is not that there are no environmental issues, or that none of the environmental regulations has done any good.  He merely points out that if we use scientific methods (rather than faith) and make claims responsibly (rather than based on self-interest), the populace will have a better understanding of the true state of the environment, and resources can be directed to the areas that are truly a source of concern.  But of course that might well mean that less governmental money, and less environmental research jobs.  Lomborg did not make many friends of the environmental stripe by publishing this book....	2002-04-15

Much of what I thought I knew about sex is a tiny fraction of what this book has documented, analyzed and argued. <br />I have known that many early Greek luminaries, such as Plato, Socrates and Sophocles were homosexual. This book puts these mere points of interest in a wholly different light by exploring the social settings of the early Grecian (Athenian) society: that the early marriages were not companionate, that women in that society, including wives, were sequestered, that boys and girls were raised separately, and not by the mother, that pederasty was almost an accepted social institution, etc.<br />I have always believed that homosexuality is a rooted genetically, although it is not binary factor. This book puts homosexuality, through the use of the \\"Kinsey scale\\", into different degrees and clearly distinguishes between homosexual tendency and homosexual activity, and defines the opportunistic homosexual in economic terms. With very simple reasoning, this book explains why urbanization seems (only seems) to foster homosexuality and the emergence of homosexual enclaves such as San Francisco and New York.<br />This book also explains, again through an economic model, why the black men in this country seem (again, only seem!) to be sexually aggressive and promiscuous, whereas sexual abuse of off-spring children (girls) have a higher incidence in white households.<br />I am also enlightened on how the child birth, which in the early days often caused the death of the mother, created serial polygamy (polygyny, to be more precise) and that the widower, who were older and more economically established men, puts young bachelors at a competitive disadvantage in securing a mate, especially in the early industrial society where the cost of marriage was high.<br />I am enlightened to the role of the Church as the promoter of companionate marriage and how its fairly profound effect on this social institution. And also why the Church \\"overtly condoned prostitution and covertly condoned monastic homosexuality.\\"<br />There are many other issues, such as infanticide, fornication, adultery, divorce, coercive and abusive sex, pornography, adoption, surrogate child-bearing ... to which Judge Posner gave interesting and informative treatment.<br />The thoroughness with which Judge Posner analyzes a problem is unmatched. Although I am not always completely convinced by his reasoning (because some of the arguments are necessarily qualitative and intuitive,) but the plausibility is striking. And I am frequently amazed by the different angles with which he looks at an issue, and the amount of facts and data he brings forth to support his views. When facts contradict what his theory predicts, he graciously points that out. In the conclusion of the book, Judge Posner, with scholarly grace and modesty, points out that his work was exploratory, a learning process for himself, and was not being presented as definitive. <br />Judge Posner's writing style is very good. The book is never boring, though some of the information and arguments are repeated due to the inter-relatedness of many of the issues. Throughout the book, the Judge's remarkable analytic skill can be felt. At one point, the Judge mercilessly took apart the New Jersey Supreme Court's opinion of the Baby M case (Stern vs. Whitehead) and clearly showed how judges, lacking knowledge on the subject matter and often ignorant about economics, proceeded to vote their own prejudices, and substituted rhetoric and sloppy logic for judicial analysis. This one episode, which clearly illustrates the reason he wrote this book, as he stated in the introduction, is worth the price of the book.<BR> <BR>How many judges are as good as Judge Posner? Since he has published so much, chances of his ever being nominated and confirmed to be a justice of the High Court must be pretty slim, considering the infamous borking effect. This is just as well. I wishfully think his publications probably has a greater influence on the society, especially the legal community, than if he were appointed a justice. <br />Having read several of Judge Posner's books, I mark him down as one of a handful of top-notch intellectuals in my estimation.	2002-03-30

I had high hopes on this book.<br />Professor Dworkin is no doubt a serious thinker and a very good writer.  However, I am disappointed in his book.  His theory in equality is well written but not well reasoned.  It seems that the professor lives and thinks in the rarefied theoretical world, but tries to develop a theory that he hopes to put into practice for the real world.  <br />Economists and demographists talk about a distribution as a manifested result of spontaneous transactions, such as the distribution income for a particular year.  The professor's starting premises has to do with a notion of distribution of resources as an action, or the direct result of policies, by some dictating authority (the government).  Although Dworkin tries not to make it sound like his views are socialistic, they in fact are.  <br />Professor Dworkin takes great care to define his preferred notion equality to be distributional equality of resources.  This immediately raises many problems:  Who grants the control of resources?  Where do these resources that are to be granted come from?  Who decides what is a fair (equal) share, given the different needs of different people? What happens over time, when individual actions and choices create new inequalities? The professor is aware of these problems and theorizes on them.  But no reasonable answers can be developed, except in small and/or theoretical cases such as a father in a position to will his assets to his off-springs, or what happens after a shipwreck on a desert island.<br />I did not finish reading the entire book - I could not justify spending time to continue after I concluded that foundation of his theory, as well as much of his \\"theorized practice\\" were so wholly academic that they placed serious limits on the usefulness of the theory itself.  Anyway, in all fairness, you should give more weight to those who have read the entire book.<br />For those who seriously ponder on the related issue of equality, fairness and justice, I would highly recommend \\"The Quest for Cosmic Justice\\" by Thomas Sowell.  You will be spared the tedious academic theorizing and get a lucid, well-reasoned dissertation on the subject.	2002-03-25

However, I find myself very much absorbed as I started to turn the pages.<br />Miss Crittenden took on a very complex and controversial subject in what might be called a contrarian approach, and presented some revealing facts, refreshing ideas and insightful analysis.  With so much poisonous theories and commentary that built and shaped the gender battlefront, which should never have been, this book is one that invites the readers to take a rational look at what women really want from the opposite sex and the society at large.  <br />If you have a daughter (or friend) at her late teens or early twenties, you should introduce her to this book.  Yes, it could be life-changing for her.	2001-01-08

And I decided to read this book because it was a highly recommended read in the Freedom's Nest Website Reading List.<br />As soon as I started reading  this book, I developed a warm feeling toward the author.  In his original  introduction, Hayek started with: &quot;When a professional student of  social affairs writes a political book, his first duty is plainly to say  so.  This is a political book....&quot;  His candor and his confidence were  so befitting with his great intellect.<br />Noting that Hayek was an  Austrian, I was impressed by his mastery of the English language and I  enjoyed his writing style.  With mild language and in simple terms, Hayek  made very sweeping predictions and patiently explained his reasoning with  convincing arguments based on economic and human behavioral theories.<br />Hayek's thesis was that central economic planning will inevitably lead  to governmental control of every facet of its citizen's life, and hence  toward a totalitarian state.  Hayek's other insightful observations:  Nazism, Fascism and communism all have the same roots.  In a totalitarian  state, it is always the ruthless and the unsophisticated who ascend to the  top.  Extensive governmental control harms the society not just in  delivering dismal economic results, but, more seriously, it produces a  psychological change, an alteration in the character of the people.<br />One  must not forget that when Hayek wrote this book, his was very much a voice  in the wilderness; he was ridiculed and denounced by his contemporaries.  But his ideas stood the test of time!  And blessedly, he lived to see that  - to see first the building and eventually the fall of the Berlin  Wall.<br />This little book was said to have had definitive influence on such  giants as Churchill, Thatcher, Reagan and many others.  Perhaps the book's  influence was best attested to by its being banned in the USSR, China and  many other totalitarian countries.<br />This book belongs on your book shelf.nd  many other totalitarian countries.<br />This book belongs on your book shelf.	2000-05-04

True, it is not an instructional book in that it does not provide step-by-step instructions to arrive at an end result.  Nonetheless, Ambrus's comments revealed a bit of the workings of  his mind as he approached his subjects, and they provide a good deal of  insight into the how these drawings are put together, such as which parts  of a figure in each case are most attention-demanding, etc.  <br />This book  is an excellent reference for the artist.  Its drawings are so beautiful  and plentiful that it also belongs on the coffee table!	2000-04-25

People mostly use their own  subjective standards for such judgment.  However, I do enjoy reading this  book thoroughly. As to the sexual explicitness, I can imagine that it would  be &quot;groundbreaking&quot; in the fifties as far as it being on printed  pages; they otherwise did not seem overly dramatized.<br />The book gives me a  sense of what a New England small town life is like.  Of course, I don't,  for a minute, believe that the events are typical.  I enjoyed all of the  characters Grace Metalious sculpted, and I also liked the plot very much.   Grace Metalious constructed a perfect web of links between the characters  to tell her story.   At the center was the evolving relationship between  Constance, her husband Tom (Mike) and her daughter, Allison.  The other  characters, such as Selena Cross, and the Harringtons added important  sidelights.   The sequel was quite well done and provided a welcome sense  of closure, although it is not as riveting as the original.<br />Yea.  I think  you will enjoy this book, too.	2000-04-18

The author's objective portrayal of the two conflicting visions, their premises, their history and their wide ranging implications and  ramifications is an excellent education for all who have a serious interest  in social and economic policies, as well as politics.<br />Like Dr. Sowell's  other books,  &quot;A Conflict of Visions&quot; was the product of  meticulous research, objective analysis and much original thought.  In my  opinion, few people in the public arena today are as brilliant and as well  informed as Dr. Sowell. <br />If you ever wondered why the same two camps of  voices combat each other on issue after issue, in politics, in law, in  economics and in social policies, if you ever wondered why no unequivocal  truth emerged from the conflicting premises through more than 200 years of  war and peace, and if you ever wondered (this is the kicker!) why one  side's vitriolic portrayal of the other side met with a generally  benevolent counter portrayal, you will find the answers in Dr. Sowell's  theory of conflicting visions.  Reading this book is like discovering  Newtonian mechanics.  <br />&quot;A Conflict of Visions&quot; is not an easy  read.   However, you won't soon forget its ideas.	1999-06-10

As a novel, Atlas Shrugged has too much preaching; as an exposition, it lacks power because practically all of the characters are far too extreme for the readers to relate to the real world.   It is a great work  nonetheless. Ayn Rand used her tremendous writing skills to forcefully  express her (somewhat extreme) social views in the form of a novel -  perhaps the most effective way to touch the minds of a lot of  people.<br />Atlas Shrugged has a great plot, the characters are vivid and  engaging.  However, the last fifth of the book was not as well formed as  the earlier part.  <br />Whether you agree with her views or not, you will  find the book thought provoking and very entertaining.  It is one of a  kind.  Don't miss it.	1999-06-04
