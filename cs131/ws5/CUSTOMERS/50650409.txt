I believe it was actually here on Amazon.com that I read someone's assesment that this book looks like an infomercial. Whoever said that... was right! You will be impressed by Schwarz's graphics and charts-- although some of them will take a bit of deciphering to comprehend. And, you'll like the easy lay out of this book  (in five parts: here's what we're talking about, here's when to do it, here's how to do it, here's why... now, do it this way...<br />My only negative critique of Schwarz is that he starts off by pummelling the church growth movement-- and its highly pragmatic orientation (which he caricatures like \\"do this and your church is guaranteed to grow by x amount of people in the next year\\"). I have no problem that he takes this approach to the movement at the outset of his book (we could stand to look at the issue from many perspectives, and I think there does need to be some balance here), but Schwarz's theories CAN come close to being just another pragmatic approach, if not read and implemented carefully.<br />His work is invaluable in that it causes us to stop, step back, and look at the issue of QUALITY growth as opposed to seeking out QUANTITY growth. Of course, I'm not so sure that many church growth books would actually disagree with this idea. Schwarz's conclusion is that if you get the quantity, quality will happen (see-- this can quickly sound like pure pragmatism, if you're not careful).<br />I think, however, he is aiming at a more organic view of growth-- than a managerial or business model. In this, his comparison in the middle of the book between a robot and a human is helpful. Sure, you can create a robot (or a church) by doing this certain thing. But, it can't change, can't adapt, can't maneuver, can't reproduce itself. On the other hand, sometimes humans are messy... but they can adapt... they are living... and so should be the Body of Christ, the Church.<br />The way Schwarz lays out his eight \\"biotic\\" (life giving) principles is helpful, especially in how he illustrates how they affect each other-- and the idea of the minimum factor, the idea of interdependence in the system, etc... In this, those charts ARE helpful.<br />Much of what he writes is not new. What is helpful, though, is that there has been a comprehensive survey going on behind the scenes of this book-- and Schwarz lets you in on the preconceptions he had, what he thought he might find out but didn't, where he was wrong in his initial gut takes, etc. In other words, the most helpful aspect of this information is HOW he says it, and how you can work through it and apply it.<br />Much of what is in this book I have read (in different ways) in Callahan's book on \\"12 Strategies of Effective Churches,\\" in Aubrey Malphurs book \\"Planting Growing Churches,\\" and others. An interesting study might be to chart all of these out side-by-side, and see what the commonalities are... Just a thought. If you're only going to be one of those books, though, get this one. The way in which the information is presented (graphically and linguistically) places this at the top of the list.	2002-06-05

Banister follows up his first release, The Word and Power Church, with his premise that there needs to be a convergence of Evangelicalism and Pentecostalism (Evangelicals could learn the passion and intimacy with Christ that Pentecostals embrance-- while Pentecostals could embrace also the depth of the Word that has defined Evangelicalism.<br />This work differs from Banister's first in that he seems to take a more individualistic look as to what this new theology (which, of course, is really very old and Biblical) would look like. That is, The Word and Power Church evaluated these concepts as to how they fit in the overall context of the Body of Christ. Here, Banister writes of what that Sacred Quest might look like on a more personal level.<br />In his usual transparent style of writing, Banister speaks of his burnout in ministry, what caused it, how the Spirit of God broke through to him in an intimate and personal way... and how his working theology continues to evolve from this relationship. <br />You will not find quick answers in the Sacred Quest. Rather, you will find the memoirs of one who is journeying along, seeking to know and do the will of God. And, you will be challenged-- and comforted-- as you take guidance from a fellow sojourner. The book is not about imparting information-- rather, it is about life transformation... a transformation that comes, steadily, as you discover-- and rediscover-- intimacy with God.	2002-05-28

Banister pens an incredible work for those looking to move beyond dry orthodoxy and into passionate, spirit-driven relationship with Christ. He pushes you to take that plunge into the unknown, to that place you so much want to go, to where you feel God tugging you... that place where what's going on in your heart matches what's going on in your head... to where you not only know ABOUT God, but have an experience of Him. <br />I like Banister's honest approach (i.e., he speaks of his role as a pastor, and of preaching, but still feeling this tension). He doesn't back down from his own shortcomings, offers a clear perspective about his own biases, and never fails to let you know where he stands...<br />His goal... it seems it to bridge that gap between orthodox evangelicalism and passionate pentecostalism-- and show us that we (he writes from the side of evangelicalism) need not sacrifice thick Truth in order to worship-- and experience God passionately, as our &quot;Charismatic&quot; brothers and sisters do. Nor, do they have to negotiate their passions when seeking out deeper revelations of God in His word. It's not that you have to choose this OR that, Banister suggests. Rather, we are invited to experience God in Word and in Spirit-- in Word and in Power-- or, as Jesus suggests, in Spirit and in Truth.<br />Is an excellent book to read, as well, if you are coming from the Pentecostal side of Christianity, and are looking for solid theological footing, and wondering if you must comprimise your style of worship, your exercise of the prophetic gifts, etc., in favor of depth. This is not to suggest that you would lack depth simply because you are coming from that perspective. And, Banister conveys that well. <br />We can learn from each other. Indeed, we SHOULD learn from each other. For we are one in Christ.	2002-05-23

He doesn't balk at the idea that ministry takes money. But, He always presents the case in terms of people instead of paper, mission instead of mortar, and investment instead of costs...<br />This book promotes the idea of seeing &quot;giving&quot; as investement in God's mission, which is for the sake of reaching people. And, Callahan suggests that there is a greater &quot;cost&quot; than giving-- that is the &quot;cost&quot; of what we lose when we don't invest in the kingdom-- the cost of rebellious children who are not taught, the cost of marriages that are not healed, the cost of not a community not knowing God. Incredible-- it always goes back to the mission and people-- and how we can invest in the Kingdom.<br />Chapter 1 is among the best in this book, and details how &quot;mission&quot; actually builds the finances of the church (not that a church does the mission for the finances, but finances to come as a result). More finances provide for a greater investment in mission, which results in more finances, which results in an even greater investment... it's cyclical. And, often, our financial problems in the church MAY result from our missional perspective. That's what I've gathered from the book, and I'm starting to agree with it.<br />The middle of this book bogs a little, although it does have some practical helpson stewardship campaigns, etc. If you're a church administrator, or the treasurer, chairman of a finance committee, ministry team, etc... you might want to read this one. If you do not directly over see the finances (the nuts and bolts) try reading Callahan's other book on church finances, &quot;Giving and Stewardship in an Effective Church,&quot; for it will appeal more to your missional theology (and much of what you find in &quot;Effective Church Finances&quot; is simply a rehash of the other book, some chapters even being copied verbatim).	2002-05-23

This book is uncharacteristically long for one of Callahan's works (most are about 130 pages or so-- this doubles those). It lacks his concise nature and brevity (Mark it, though-- he usually says a lot in a few words, and it does take time to wade through and gather all of his wisdom). This book bogs a little in the middle, as far as readability...<br />Nonetheless, Callahan provides great insight as to how to run a smaller church. Often, small churches (which they all start out as, even if planting one)attempt to be &quot;mini-megas,&quot; as C calls them. The reality is... some will be mega-churches one day... but, they must live that tension between where they are today, and the vision of what God has called them to become in the future. And, rather than doing EVERYTHING right now, they are better off doing one or two things INCREDIBLY WELL NOW, then adding on from there. In other words, vision means that many times you have to say &quot;no&quot; to good opportunities. <br />This allows the church to focus its energies in moving forwards, creating critical mass to do other things... which brings success in an area, providing momentum... which brings success and more momentum... <br />The book as an organic, relational approach to church growth, which is refreshing. That is, growth happens naturally through relationships with people-- not by getting into trap of throwing out more programs (a tendency in the small church, wanting to be a mini-mega). <br />Callahan calls churches to be strong-- and to start building on their strengths. To take seriously the gifts and abilities and resources God has placed in that Body... And, to build the Kingdom.	2002-05-23

Published in 1983, Callahan's work, in my mind, bucks the notion that &quot;newer is always better.&quot; Indeed, as you read this book you will be familiar with it already-- because so much of what you read about today must have, in some way, found its roots in Callahan's ideas (i.e. many have read &quot;Purpose Driven Church,&quot; by Rick Warren, which is also an informative read, but have no idea that many of the concepts put forth by Warren seem to originate here).<br />Callahan's book is straight-forward-- and is applicable in any church, in any size, in any location, and in any setting. He doesn't presume that you need a certain worship style-- his writing is not so shallow as that. Or, that you need a contemporary building (or a traditional one). No, he goes beyond the &quot;surface&quot; issues that we so often get stuck in and looks at the church in light of its MISSION.<br />That would be a central idea to Callahan in this-- and in all of his writings, as a matter of fact-- THE MISSIONAL CHURCH. In this work, he describes how the mission is central, and how various aspects of the church (he deals with facilities, visibility, mission and vision, finances, relationship, leadership, etc.) fit together to fuel the mission (rather than detract from it, or run as separate, disjuncted aspects of the organism).<br />A great read. You will benefit from the two introductions (on planning and hope, and mission and success) and chapter 1 (&quot;Specific, Concrete Missional Objectives&quot;) alone. Those twenty pages are worth the price of the book, which is good... again... not because it is trendy, but because so many trendy works have stood on the shoulders of this groundbreaking work.	2002-05-23

I thought I'd probably read through, mark if off the list of things I've been referred to read, then never look at the book again. <br />What a surprise!<br />Callahan walks you through several principles about giving-- and how these principles, when enacted, help reach the potential God places in each follower of Christ through His Spirit. He speaks of people wanting to give to winning causes, and how the fact that we speak the vision in a positive (or needy) way changes people's perspective and willingness to give. He speaks of &quot;the ask&quot; and of other great concepts, many of which have much to do with leadership in other areas besides the finances of the Church.<br />I'm impressed by the practicality of this work, as well. And, of how Callahan offers useable space in the actual text for you to jot your ideas, thoughts, and how you might implement some of these principles.<br />Also, if you've ever wondered if &quot;special offerings&quot; willl detract from &quot;general funds&quot; (i.e. &quot;Will people give to this and forget about that...?&quot;), KC addresses that, in depth, as well. <br />A great book. You can read it in a few hours, but it will take much longer to digest-- even though it can be implemented immediately!	2002-05-16

This book will jump out as being a little out of date as you are reading (Sweet mentions the possibility of using the VCR not the DVD player, he speaks of the probability that people will be using personal computers at home, he mentions nothing of the internet), because there have been so many changes (see above) which have taken place since the publication of Q.S.<br />However, Sweet's insight into &quot;people&quot; and &quot;perspectives&quot; in timeless. And, the incarnational Gospel he calls us to live out (using the tools of the day-- whatever they may be) make this book worth the read. In addition, the fact that book is a little out-dated (by techonology mentioned only) does give you a chance to evaluate-- how much of what he has suggested has come true? how much has been useful? how might we have better taken some of the advice? In other words, read it NOW and look BACK and you can &quot;case study&quot; yourself and your ministry for the last few  years. That's worth the price of the book and the time it will take to wade through it, alone.	2002-04-30

Face it-- as the book says, &quot;We want a map.&quot; We want to know what to expect, how to move, what to navigate around... We want seven steps now, eight steps before we get there...<br />Yet, LS reminds us that Christ never gave a map. He was never that pragmatic. Rather, He called us to intimacy, to relationship (&quot;Follow Me.&quot;). Using the idea of &quot;true North&quot; as our guidepost, Sweet expounds upon the idea of the Church as a ship... (Another interesting read here, which is somewhat related is Ike Reighard's &quot;Discovering Your North Star&quot;.) In this &quot;sink or swim&quot; time for the Church, this message bears our time and careful attention.	2002-04-30

In this book, which continues to build on Piper's idea that our &quot;duty&quot; as Christians is to delight ourselves in intimacy with our Heavenly Father, he speaks of the power of prayer and fasting-- and how these disciplines which seem to be so tedious, so difficult, so &quot;duty&quot; like actually release some of the greatest freedom and joy we can experience in this life.<br />Read it along with Dallas Willard's &quot;Spirit of the Disciplines&quot; and/ or Richard Foster's &quot;Celebration of Disciplines.&quot;	2002-04-30

Zahl's work stood out from the beginning because of how he begins this theological treatise-- with Christology. For him, Christ is the center of God's revelation to us, the crux of our faith, the epicenter from which our thoughts and beliefs about God should expand. It sounds like a no-brainer, that we would discuss Christianity from the standpoint of Christology. Yet most theological works start with Scripture, Natural Theology... Or the question of whether or not there is a God and what leads us to believe there is... I like this approach better-- not only does it make sense (Why didn't I think of this before and write the book? I'm thinking... or, Why didn't someone else...?), but it is Biblical-- as Christ is the epicenter of the Scriptures. Short enough to be read in one sitting, you will probably want to take each of the 25 theses alone, so that you can think through (and savor) the ramifications of each.	2002-04-30

Spirit of the Disciplines takes us back to what the early Christian mystics, such as the desert fathers, sought-- communion, intimacy, with God. Not programs, not more things on a list of &quot;things to do.&quot; Simply being. It is in this &quot;being&quot; still and knowing God that God transforms the disciple-- and, ironically, empowers the diciple to do more than they could have done just by doing. The odd thing... we tend to look on the practices that Willard (and others like him, for instance, Richard Foster) suggests as &quot;doing&quot; the wrong things... or doing things that don't make much of a difference, since, at first, they seem so unquantifiable (how can you measure fasting? time spent in prayer? solitude? service?). At any rate, Willard helps us take this important journey, this shift, in this book. A definite tool for the journey.	2002-04-30

Why this is not selfish or vain... How God is our highest good... How this drives the mission of the Church...<br />The book (and others Piper has written) do much to recover our \\"buddy Jesus\\" ideaology that has pervaded the Church. And, in doing so, he rearticulates the idea that, although God is intimate with us (so much so that the Word became flesh, and that the Spirit now indwells us), He is still God. He is still sovereign. He is still high above, transcendant...	2002-04-30

Strobel does a great job bringing his journalistic background to the table and interviewing various scholars in their respective areas of expertise to nail down the Truth of the Cross of Christ. This book was refreshing in that it takes you a bit deeper than many popular apologetic books, yet, at the same time gives you personal insight into the character of the scholars and Strobel himself. Very personal style of writing...<br />It's odd in that it reads much like a story... a story of exploration (an introspective Lewis and Clark tale, perhaps). At the same time, though, it will take some time to wade through the arguments and presentations (which are helped along by the fact that you do feel like you're reading a conversation rather than a dissertation).	2002-04-28

Brennan Manning, in an honest (yes, sometimes it even seems rough and abrasive) and authentic look at grace, writes one of the best interpretations of the Gospel of Jesus Christ I've read. He speaks of grace as a gift, yet doesn't shy away from what it costs. He speaks of following Christ wholeheartedly, yet not falling into a rut of legalism and religious rhetoric. He keeps us mindful of some of the tension in the Christian life (Jesus is the lion and the lamb, Christians must lose their lives to find life, the Cross was life, etc.), and reminds us that grace is not some wishy-washy concept that can be nailed down. Grace is complex. It is God's passionate pursuit of us until we literally &quot;find&quot; him. <br />Not a good book (I don't think) for someone wanting to understand the basics of Christianity. Rather, Manning provides a fresh perspective for those who are weary in their faith journey, who need to see their faith, again, through the eyes of another.	2002-04-28

In Celebration of Discipline he calls us back to some of the historical &quot;disciplines&quot; of the faith-- things that have become all too easy to skip over and relegate to a level of second importance in our consumer/ microwave/ instant fix/ cell phone culture.<br />Things like fasting-- a practice we here of (some) and read about in Scripture...

Let alone and explanation as to its theological importance and the practical applications of how...<br />Or the discipline of solitide... and how it's different than loneliness. Or a defintion of worship... of giving... of mediation (who in our day and age has actually done that before-- on purpose?).<br />This is an important work for the Church-- not only because it recaptures and places into discussion some important practices of our faith, but it does so in a way that celebrates our freedom to do these in order to experience God (as opposed to legalistically doing them to appease Him). And, Foster shows you how to get there... or, at least, get going...<br />Don't buy it if you want an inspirational read.

Yes, it seems strange to write a review on the Bible, but... here it goes...<br />It's been said that many people don't understand the Bible because they don't read it. And, they don't read it because, let's be honest, there's much in it that's difficult to understand (so you get into a bit of a cycle here-- it's hard, so you don't read, so you don't understand, so it's hard, so you...).<br />That's where this book enters the scene... And, here's how it's helped me (this was the first copy of the Bible I bought AND actually read-- I'm still working on the understanding it part-- and the \\"living it out\\" part even more).<br />First, the NIV text is very readable (moreso than King James and even some of the other modern translations). It reads a lot like you might talk. You can understand what it's saying, then, without weeding through the \\"thee's\\" and \\"shalts\\" and \\"bidsts\\" etc... In my opinion, a more readable translation makes it more enjoyable to read, makes it more likely that you will read... and insures that you comprehend more as you do read.<br />Second, the Life Application Bible provide great information in the margines (including notes for just about every verse, personal profiles of many people in the bible, and small write-ups on other relevant topics and events). You can read biographies about people you are meeting in the stories, view the maps to see where they are where they've been, and make quick personal applications. That, in effect, is what this Bible is about-- both reading and comprehending the Word of God so that you can live it out (the hard part).<br />If you buy this Bible (any Life Application would be like this, as well, it would just be a different translation) you will, in all seriousness, have a commentary, small Bible dictionary, and a few maps and biographies with you.<br />If you're searching for a study Bible, or a first \\"adult\\" Bible... go ahead and get this one. If you already have an NIV version, get the Life Application versionof the NASB, or NKJV...	2002-04-28

Is a good book to read if you're searching to (and, I know this is ironic) nail down postmodernism to a few tenets you can understand. Provides the necessary framework to understand the topic when it comes up-- and, at the same time, Grenz does a good job of sifting out the negatives of the movement while pointing to the opporutunties it holds for Christianity to communicate to this culture.<br />Does not contain much info at all an literature, art, and architecture, which are the main purveyors of the movement. Then, again, by the time most of us in the Church catch wind of anything like PM it's already in the rear-view mirror for most of society, anyway.	2002-04-28

I was encouraged that this book speaks more to the sovereignty of God, than it does the sovereignty of America. Don't misunderstand, I am pro-America, proud to be here... but, the danger is that we equate Americana with the Kingdom of God. <br />Lucado, the word-smith that he is, draws us back to our Heavenly Father in this work. The message he suggests: &quot;God is pro-you.&quot; (As opposed to God is for-America). That's a complex idea to communicate, it seems. And, Lucado's inspirational work here focuses us in a much needed away.<br />Another book to read... of a much different audience... Saint Augstine's The City of God (note, though, Lucado's work is inspirational and Augustine is somewhat academic in that work).	2002-04-28

This won't keep you guessing and wondering who's guilty-- or not-- and how the plot will unfold. You pretty much figure it out within the first few pages. Then, again, what's most captivating about this tale is not what the people (the Kranks) do-- but that they even do it at all! And, it something we wish we could do-- if we're honest. Skip Christmas!?!?<br />In the line of Charles Dickens (even the names of the people reflect who they are-- think, Krank, Scrooge, Tom Thumb...), Grisham weaves this little story (short enough to read in one sitting, long enough to allow you to read a chapter a night before bed) that takes us not only through the actual act of skipping Christmas (in a way), but takes us through the pyschology of it as well. We feel-- and identify-- with the tensions of money spent, good gifts given and bad gifts received, parties no one wants to go to but needs to show out for anyway, etc...<br />Oddly enough, the quirky story is a small mirror that reveals much to you (if you'll admit it, and wrestle with it) about the condition of your own soul.	2002-04-28

Many people are responding to this book with great praise (i.e., &quot;I prayed the prayer and look what happened to me! Now, I'm...&quot;). Others are repsonding to it with great criticism (&quot;This is like a hocus-pocus thing... and Jesus never said to pray this way, etc...&quot;).<br />The key here... is to pray. God has promised to move if His people pray. And, we don't.<br />Fact is... we would rather read a book about prayer, than to pray (just as we would rather read a book about the Scriptures than dig through the Word).<br />If you're going to read this book and think it will change your life, it won't. You'll be disappointed.<br />But, if you think that reading this book will give you some principles, some encouragement, and some boost in your praying... You're probably right.<br />But, ultimately, that will be decided not by how fast you read the book, how many times you recite the prayer of Jabez, or if you even like the book...<br />You will have to pray... honestly, openly, speaking to your Heavenly Father who knows your needs, even before you ask.	2002-04-27

All are biblical-- none are legalistic. All are process type things (you work at them, over time, towards a life-style transformation as opposed to just doing \\"one thing\\" and checking it off the box) instead of one-shot deals.<br />Would recommend for believers looking for a fresh approach to historical Christianity, if wanting to get into a small group study but not use one of the pre-packaged fill-in-the-blank books.	2002-04-27

One of the most powerful influences on our lives is story. The stories of other people. I them, we see ourselves reflected (or refracted, perhaps, as the case may be). And, in some way, a living sermon (for good or bad) has always spoken more clearly than a preached one.<br />In &quot;Soul Survivor&quot; Yancey works his story into the stories of those who have gone before him, those he has learned from (again, for good or bad). In this, see three stories emerging, then... 1) theirs, 2) his, and 3) hopefully, our own.<br />Interestingly enough, some of those Yancey learns from (through their stories) are Christians (MLK, Jr.) and some are not (Gahndi, for instance). <br />Read it, and discover your story.	2002-04-27

Too often there is one without the other, resulting in dry, crusty beliefs that lack spirit and passion-- or, on the other hand, a tendency to get lost in the moorings of the Scripture, and getting trapped in one's own agenda or &quot;canon within the canon.&quot; Boice articulates the importance of the great beliefs of the faith (the ascension, for instance) and how our neglect of them as influenced our reading of Scripture, our articulation of the Gospel, and, subsequently, the power of the Message we proclaim (or lack thereof). I don't know that this was his agenda when he began writing or not. Nevertheless, it is certainly a welcome by-product of this work and the Church will be the better for wrestling with these concepts.	2002-04-27

A very insighful work that does not shy away from the tough issue presented in 1 Corinthians (people following men instead of God, sleeping around in the church, slander and gossip and jealousies, coveting...).<br />The only part of this work I had any trouble with was the cessionaist approach MacArthur takes towards the gifts of the Spirit (12-14). Then, again, it is good to read the thoughts of sound thinking evangelicals-- even when they disagree with you on peripheral issues.<br />Perhaps the best aspect of this work is that... anytime MacArthur writes, you know he has thought and prayed through his position. And, he will not write something unless he can defend it from the Scriptures. This is helpful when you are unsure about some issue (divorce and remarriage, for instance, and presented in 1 Corinthians 7 f.), and it is honest even when you disagree.<br />I've read a few in the series of commentaries he offers. I would not buy the entire set (of any set of commentaries, really, because some are outstanding and others fall a bit short). This is one I would definitely grab hold of, if you can fork out the [money] for it.	2002-04-27

I was intrigued to read Wilkinson's &quot;follow up&quot; to the the work on Jabez's prayer-- especially after seeing the way it polarized so many people (being completely for it, or completely against it). I wondered what he would say, what message he would carry on, how we would clarify (if at all) the ideas presented in his first book.<br />The one aspect I did not like about Jabez was that it seemed so preoccupied with material things (hence, much of the criticism that was levelled at the work-- and much of the interest in it at the same time). In the &quot;Secrets of the Vine,&quot; which I thought might lead us more towards &quot;getting that stuff&quot; (i.e. Was there a magic thing to do while you prayed the prayer of Jabez? Did you need to say it in a certain tone, or certain amout of times...?), I was impressed that Wilkinson directs us to...<br />Intimacy with God.<br />That's it. And that's really what we need to know. Know, intellectually-- and know, experientially.<br />Wilkinson speaks of what that looks like-- and wrestles (skillfully-- much more skillfully than in the prayer of Jabez) with the text of John 15 (&quot;I am the vine, you are the branches... Abide in me...&quot;).<br />He speaks of how God wants to (not bless us with stuff) use us so that we can be a blessing. And how we must be intimate with Him for Him to shape us into vessels He can use to do that. Incredible. <br />Even if you didn't like Jabez, by this one.	2002-04-27

Does take some time and effort to work through, but well worth it...<br />Main point-- argues against the &quot;Jesus Says...&quot; (Spiritual version of Simon Says). For a long time, growing up, I thought the Christian life was a lot like that game Simon Says- except it was Jesus Says. The problem was, you could never do it. Read your Bible. Pray. Go there. Nope. Don't...<br />We forget, Christianity is not- in its essence- a game of &quot;Jesus Says...&quot; In this book, Willard moves us  beyond that... beyond rigid religion and into relationship... and, of course, shows us what that looks like...<br />Based on the framework of the Sermon on the Mount, this book reminded me a lot of J.I.Packer's &quot;Knowing God,&quot; if that correlation makes sense.	2002-04-22

But, I think that he reads much into it. Instead of wrestling with some of the tough issues that creep up in the book of Acts, with which the church needs to struggle, he gives pat, comfortable answers (i.e., in regard to financial matters, the idea of physical healing, the gifts of the Spirit, etc.). <br />No, I don't have the answers on all of those issues, which is why a more honest struggle with them, in print, would be helpful. More helpful than just dismissing some very relevant issues. <br />Anyway, please, please do not take this as a personal &quot;slam&quot; on MacArthur and his ministry-- obviously, he's a very anointed leader. And, I would recommend some of his other commentaries (1 Corinthans, for example). I just was not impressed on this one, and, if you have a limited book budget,  by another commentary on Acts.<br />(FYI... it is helpful, if you do have this one, to read it in tandem w/ C.Peter Wagner's commentary on Acts, which takes the polar-opposite stance on almost every issue MacArthur presents.)	2002-04-22

Great book... very thought provoking... and will bring a few new concepts to surface about Jesus (i.e. He wasn't like Mr.Rogers, but was someone that the establishment saw as a big enough threat to actually want to exterminate, He had Jewish instead of Anglo-Saxon roots, etc...).<br />Most of what Philip Yancey writes is very articulate, very well written, and well informed. This book is no exception, and it's encouraging to see a devout follower of Christ who has some depth, and has, obviously, struggled through the issues he is presenting rather than throwing out simple answers.<br />The videos (old movies about Jesus) Yancey references, and many of his resources are available in the study pack, as well. And, it's worth going to check out from the local library to watch as you read (when he references something).<br />Again, a solid book. At Christian bookstores, the tendency is to put the more popular fluff up front, so you may not have even seen this one before (it's several years old). Should be moved back up front, though... needs to be read, then, perhaps, re-read in tangent with the Gospels. It will defintely add a new dimension to them.	2002-04-22

This book recovers a much needed perspective for the evangelical church-- the importance of theology (what we believe about God) and intimacy (how well we know God). Too often, we get caught in the middle, in methodology (how we do things). Most books, most conferences, etc., deal with &quot;how&quot; instead of the other, more pertinent issues, which Piper relays from Edwards in this book. (I see this most often in the &quot;church growth&quot; movement-- where pastors all get together, go to conferences, and seek to copy what's working in some other place in the country, rather than struggling to know God in the present.)<br />J.Edwards was one who, according to Piper, was steeped in both theology and piety-- both, without neglect the other. Theology without intimacy leads to cold, dry orthodoxy. Yet, intimacy without theology often has no moorings... no depth...<br />The book is challenging... and will stretch you to move beyond simply copying the methods of others (whether you're a church leader or whatever) and get back to the God you know and relating to that God as you seek to know Him and make His glory known.	2002-04-22

Wild at Heart is a great book, not only if you are a man but also 1) wife, or 2) a parent with a son (whether you're the mom or dad). It will help you understand the male persona from a biblical, rather than pop-pschological, point-of-view.<br />One popular movement in the Church suggests that what is missing in most evangelical circles is 1) deep theology (which has been traded, in effect, for a more pragmatic approach), and 2) intimacy with God (again, replaced by pragmatism). Many times, we neglect those two and look only at methodology (how do you...?, etc.). Much preaching and teaching has morphed in this direction, to our deteriment, as has been the case with much writing.<br />Eldredge seems to regain the balance in this book-- it's definitely not a \\"how to\\" book, although you will have a stronger idea of how to lead (as a man), or how to raise a son, etc... Eldredge provides a strong foundation here-- based on Scripture-- as to who we are in the image of God (and, of course, \\"what that means\\" follows).<br />His central arguments... First, we are created in the image of God, who is passionate and fierce (Eldredge does much w/ the war imagery in the Old Testament, and the idea of spiritual warfare that fills the New Testament). We were created, he suggests, for excitement... for the Quest... for the adventure.<br />Second, there are things that hold us back this calling-- and we feel the tension for it. Things like the idea that men should be \\"tame\\" and \\"calm.\\" (Don't read this as a book that promotes maile chauvenism, hunting at the expense of family time, or beating your chest like Tarzaon). His simple idea is that most of us don't live up to the Biblical idea of true masculinity...<br />Third, finally... and we could go on... Eldredge presents the idea that the true masculine self must be found in God. He is the one that heals old wounds, gives the vision of the life to live, and empowers it... Sure, we search for meaning and defintion in other places, butfinding our worth (and image of what we are to be) in the Father alone makes us better leaders, better lovers, wiser workers, more passionate live-ers.<br />Another book to read... The Sacred Romance, by the same author with his pal, Brent Curtis.	2002-04-21

Peter Wagner obviously writes this book from the perspective of \\"power evangelism.\\" That will turn some people on, it will turn others off. Often, it seems that he allows that framework to guide the biblical text, rather than allow the text to guide his discussion/commentary. Yet, I would suggest that you read the book, anyway. He provides the forum for a discussion that needs to take place. Why don't people get healed today, as they used to in Scripture? Why don't we pray like we used to? What is the difference between how other nations handle missions, as opposed to how we do in the U.S., and could we not learn from them...? Such are some of the issues Wagner discusses. If you read this, two things...<br />1. Read it alongside MacArthur's Commentary on Acts 1-12, in which MacArthur seems to dismiss the idea that healing and power evangelism takes place, except in cases of theological excesses and misappropriation of Truth (see both commentaries comments on chapter 3:1f. with the lame man at the temple, for instance).<br />2. You will want to pick up another of Wagner's books on Prayer and Spiritual Warfare, because, again, much of what Wagner writes here seems to be filtered by those books, first, rather than the biblical text. (Then, again, we all bring our preconceptions to the table-- and he is very honest about them-- and they are definitely issues we need to wrestle with).	2002-04-21

I know they say that sometimes the art and artist critique the critic-- and what you say reveals more about you yourself than about the great master. That could definitely be the case here. No doubt this man 1) knows the Scripture, and 2) has written and ministered with the power and authority of God...<br />But, if you can only buy one book (commentary) on Acts, go try Adjith Fernando's NIV Application Commentary.	2002-04-21

It is a resource of quotes, for the most part. So, it's not like a typical commentary, where you can read the passage of Scripture, then read the &quot;commentary&quot; and have an idea of what's being said. This book is full of quotes (a few lines long) related to each passage.<br />2. Which leads me to the second point... Usually, when you have a commentary you know the author's bias-- whether he/she is conservative, liberal, their theological leanings, etc., and you can make like adjustments when reading. Not so here. You will need to be somewhat versed in Church History (or have access to a book) in order to distinguish the sound theology of these individuals from the not-so-sound/heretical theology. And, it's possible (as was the case with Origen, for instance) that some of what they say is sound and some is way, way off... You just need to have some tool to make that distinction.<br />3. This book is very helpful, nonetheless, because we often forget that the ancient Christians struggled with the essentials doctrines of the faith for hundreds of years... and were versed in Scripture (although some of them get lost in allegory, etc.). It is both helpful-- and respectful-- I think, to know what these fore-runners in the faith said.<br />Buy the book-- but only if you already have some other commentaries (or resources) you can consult.	2002-04-21
