They don't explain the background of the Princess much.  Princess and William seem to have a cold interaction, yet he claims he's in love with her, or could it be just in lust with her? The book gives the perspective mostly through William's point of view, but should also reflect the Princess to make their interaction and feelings towards each other more real.  I think if the author wrote more of the background of the Princess within the story, then it would make the story more interesting.  I've enjoyed most of Lois Greiman's books, but found this one needs improvement on a lot of areas.  It was a dry reading for me.	2005-02-06

You could see that they both loved each other and would be willing to risk anything to be with the other.

I've not been disappointed yet.  I think &quot;Invitation to Seduction&quot; was another great success.  She really outdone herself with the characters in this book.  Both Richard and Kitty share a strong attraction for each other, as well as having a strong determination in following their plans.  Richard is determined to have Kitty in his life, yet Kitty who is betrothed before meeting Richard is fighting to ignore her attraction and go along with her wedding plans with her fiance.  I enjoyed reading and watching their contest of wills, and seeing how it would develop from beginning to end.  There's a twist in there, and you wouldn't have thought of it earlier til the end of the book, don't cheat now!  I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good romance story.	2004-06-01

The story focuses on finding the outlaws who killed and robbed money from the McKettricks.  Amanda poses as a nun, but Kade McKettrick believes she is hiding something.  Her past catches up to her when Gig Curry,a mean, old bf of her mom's come to threaten her life for her half brother, Cree.  Kade becomes Marshall when the one prior to him had a stroke.  He captures Gig after a horse race who is accused of murdereing 12 soldiers and robbing.  Throughout the book they try to solve the problem.  They also try to resolve the relationship between the McKettrick brothers and Holt.<br />I thought the story reflected too much on the outlaw problem rather than having it focus on the relationship between Kade and Mandy.  Romance is lacking in this book, which is why I would call it more fiction than anything else. The book was a bit dry.  This is not something worth buying, perhaps buy as used or rent from library.	2003-11-25

I just finished the book, thinking it ended, it really never did.  Obviously the story as well as Kate and Jared will continue in the next series or two.  Frankly, if the author had created more romance with the couple rather than having it focused on saving a famine and watching over the children, the other series would probably have readers anxiously waiting for the next series to hit the bookstore.  Since it wasn't focused on romance as it should be, the other series may have readers wait til they hit the used stores or the library for a cheaper read to make it worth it's read.  I don't know if I will even buy them, much less take a peak to get a glimpse of what the book is about.  The author did make Andrew and Ross more likable as well as having a better personality than Jared to make you want to hear their stories foretold.  So she may pull it off with those two if she focuses more on the romance than solving a global problem.  <br />Don't get me wrong, it's good to see a story of an independant woman who wants to help those who are less fortunate than her.  But the story lacked so much things that it needed for it to be a good read.  I was not satisfied at all how the book ended.  I wanted those couple to finish with a happy resolution and start off with the next book in the series to be fresh and new characters. The author didn't give enough background for Jared to make you want to like him enough. Not even Kate knew him well even at the end. I'm sure their story will continue to the next book in the series.  I don't even know if I'd want to finish their story since it really left me disappointed.  Her other books are great, this one just doesn't pass.	2003-11-11

The nuptials, however, are interrupted by the appearance of a flame-haired beauty carrying two babies, boldly claimin that she is his wife and mother of his two infant sons.  Armed with her seven very large brothers, she has come to demand her due.<br />Having waiting one year for the return of the handsome laird who wedded her, bedded her, and then disappeared, Ilsa Campbell MacEnroy takes matters into her own hands and sets out to reclaim the man she briefly and passionately loved.  Stunned by his denial, her heart softens when she learns of the injury that has ravaged his memory.  Now, she faces the nearly impossible task of conquering his past--and hi s fierce reluctance to share his heart.  Though desire flares hot and wild between them, it will take more to win his trust.  It will take the magic touch of a woman in love..&quot;<br />My Review<br />There's an error in that back insert, her family name is Cameron, not Campbell.  Ilsa tries her best to gain Diarmot's trust.  Diarmot has a hard time trusting a woman since his late wife was a lying, cheating, and mad woman.  Attempt had been made for his life after he leaves Ilsa to return home where he has been attacked brutally that caused a memory loss.  He thinks her brothers and herself are still suspects for wanting to get him murdered.  However, he slowly realizes she is innocent of the crime when she was poisoned.  Her family along with his tries to find the murder before Ilsa, Diarmot, or family are the next victim.  Diarmot's trust and love grows as he gets to know and live with her.  I loved the book, loved all the characters, and the story.  Hannah Howell is a great author, so don't miss out on any of her books!	2003-11-03

She made Tony to be someone who is gullible towards Letty, who is obsessed with getting Tony to be her husband.  Regardless of seeing Letting giving pain to Amanda, an indentured servant whom he fell in love with, he still sees Letty as innocent of giving torture.  He makes Letty his mistress off and on. He believed in her lies rather than believing in Amanda.  Mason does a great job with making one hate Letty easy.  I hated her a lot as soon as I saw a few paragraphs about her!  This book is really really harsh, so if you can handle reading it, go for it.  I felt touched everytime Amanda faced pain in her life, especially at the end.  At the end of the book, when it could have been the end of the story where Amanda and tony were happily married with 2 kids, Letty comes back and the story continues with more pain. Instead of Tony fighting off Letty's blackmail in which Tony has to sleep with Letty for a year and she will burn Amanda's indentured papers.  It made me irritated that instead of going somewhere to think about a solution to solve the blackmail he goes and screws Letty after a few minutes of getting the blackmail.  It also made me mad that Amanda forgave him to easily after he told her about the affair even though she knew about it.  <br />This is a harsh love that Amanda goes through with Tony since she has to endure him being with Letty and watching and hearing them have sex.  She had to endure a lot of torture done to her throughout the book.  I think Mason went to far with the blackmail, she should have ended it right before Letty arrived back.  Why would she give the book more torture than it needs to?  Would I suggest this book?  I can only say again, if you can handle harsh treatment done to someone, then you may like this book.  I don't think for me I could read this book over again.  I would say this is not something worth buying, unless you borrowed from a friend or library.	2003-10-26

Alicia longs to follow her dreams to be married to a man who loves her in return.  But she puts that aside for the sake of her 3 young brothers and her sister who are left improverish.  They made it to the balls by luck and wit, dressing to the next fasion and a false pretense of Alicia being a widow. Only Tony seem to get close to her emotionally and physically.  Tony, who assume Alicia is a widow, sets his mind to seducing her into passion.  Alicia finally accepts herself as a mistress for Tony.  Along the way they are very attatched to each other emotionally. From the first time Tony sees her, he protects her from start to end. There are several scenes of sex, just to give a little warning.  <br />The only thing that I really don't like is the story behind it, it seems her new series is more into mystery than romance.  The book is so longwinded that it takes forever to finish a paragraph and so long to finish the book.  It's a good thing she made the characters very likable else I wouldn't have finish the book.<br />I believe the next book will be about Charles St. Austell who goes out to find out the second traiter who is worse than A.C	2003-10-11

Laird of Stonehaven is about a Faery women, Blair, who is a healer and a seer.  People consider Faery women to be evil, and a witch.  Whenever she is around people, they draw away from her and curse her for being a \\"witch.\\"  Yet, somehow Blair manages to win most of the villagers' hearts.  Blair's brother Niall and friend Mccay partner up to control Blair's wealth and her \\"powers.\\"  Knowing of Niall's evilness, Blair's father urges Graeme, Laird of Stonehaven,to wed her so that she would be saved from Niall's evil plans.  Blair refuses to love him, for that will break her healing gifts if she loved, and the love not returned.  Only way for the healing gifts to keep intact is if they both love each other.  Blair thought he was uncapable since he told her of his broken heart, and loving a pure woman.  He takes her to his home, and tries to protect her from harm.  However, some accidental events took place that caused her harm.  She has to face fire, water, and stone in order to pass the test.  Graeme has a hard time believing that she's a healer who has good intentions.  He also has a hard time fighting back his emotions for her.<br />I enjoyed reading this book.  I love Connie Mason's books, so I know this book wouldn't disappoint me.  The storyline was a little iffy for me, since I'm not really into reading books about spirits, witchcraft.  But I gave it a try since Mason wrote it.  I'm glad that I bought it.  It's definitely a little different from her books, but refreshing to see a little variety from the normal story plot. She did a great job with the characters and the plot, yet I thought she kind of did most of the sex plots the same, kind of like cut and paste in certain places.  But overall, I would say it's worth buying and a good read.  If you are Connie Mason's fans like me, then you already have a copy of it!  If not, get it!	2003-09-11

Since there isn't a summary of what Angel of Fire is about, let me tell you what this book is about.<br />Chrestian de Lontaine's life changes after the news of her father's death.  She plans for herself to be a nun after seeing her twin, Adelaine, marry to their father's friend.  She meets Weston FitzStephens, who rides to take Lontaine for his King Henry, after he helps her group of an ambush from an unknown enemy.  Weston, an arrogant, fierce warrior takes Chrestien as a prisoner after realizing that \\"Christopher\\" belongs to Lontaine.  His life changes after he realizes that \\"Christopher\\" is a woman and the daughter of Gilbert, who turns into a traitor in favor of Normandy.  King Henry orders Weston to marry  Chrestien.  Weston realizes that Chrestien is not like other selfish women, and finds himself in love with her. She realizes that she isn't meant to be a nun. She also falls in love with him yet has a hard time believing of Weston's love for her since he doesn't say the words.  They both have strong personalities in which they seem to have arguments from time to time.<br />I hope that summary helps!  I know it's hard to buy a book without having a book review/summary about it.  Words of advice to those who sell books or going to, WRITE SUMMARIES ON THE BOOKS YOU SELL!!!!  You'll profit better with a summary than without.  <br />What I think about the book:  It's great, a must-read.  It's worth buying.  You would want it as a collection.  Tanya Crosby did a great job with the story and the characters.  This is a Viking theme so if you enjoy reading Viking stories, buy this one!  I was touched, even cried at one part of the book.  Chrestien faces a lot of hardship in the story, but she's got a stong personality to overcome any obstacles in her way.  Weston is someone right for Chrestien who is unlike other men in that century and respects Chrestien's spirit.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  Author did a great job!	2003-07-14

US	51744606	R19ZLXDG4RZU0K	0380778521	779529367	Midnight Lord	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Found it disappointing	The first of the sequel, Midnight Bride, was great to read and loved the characters, Rachel and Jerome.  The author did a great job in pairing them up together as well as giving them great characteristics.<br />However, I was disappointed that the second book, Midnight Lord, didn't match up with the characters and the story as the first book did.  If this book was read first before Midnight Bride, I wouldn't blame readers to not read other books by Marlene Suson.  For which I am glad that I read the first book first.<br />The story was long and boring.  Very mediocre. There wasn't much action to keep the story exciting, much less interesting.  I only finish the book so that I can see how Rachel reacted to Stephen's return to London.  Summing up the book, I can say, the book is about an English Lord who escapes from a plantation as an indentured servant and finds himself being helped by a woman and her young brother.  He recovers and wants to go back to London and seek revenge on the person who gave him to a slave ship to die.  During his stay with the woman, he develops a strong character within himself as well as falling in love with the woman who help him to health.<br />I found Meg (Megan) to be annoying and has a low self-esteem throughout the book.  She doesn't trust Stephen from the beginning.  Not even til the very end of the book.  Also, doesn't mention her love to him when Stephen confesses his love to her a couple of times.  Says she went to London with him due to her love for him, yet I doubt that since she is married to him so has to do what he tells her to do.  She even said that she can't love him if she doesn't trust him.  So I doubt that she loved him til the very end when she realizes by others pointing that he was an Earl and not a murderer. When they did go to London, she then doubted his fidelity towards her since she thinks she's plain.  I could understand her having some doubt and not trusting him in the beginning of the story but it dragged ontil the end, which I find it annoying.  He showed her a few times that he is one to be trusted.  She didn't even thank him for saving her life from [drowning!!!]<br />What I can't stand in Stephen is that he doesn't stand firm with Meg when he should have when she told him that she doesn't believe in him.  It seems that he is only interested in her feelings rather than his, but I guess that's a good thing sometimes.  But I don't think it was good in this book.  He should have told her that after showing she could trust him, that if she can't trust him, then he'd rather be without her.  It would have made the story interesting if that was done and then have them reunited so Meg can have a wakeup call that she has to trust or she'll be left alone due to her inability to trust others.<br />I'm reading Midnight Bandit, and so far it's interesting.  so do yourself a favor, read Midnight Bride and Midnight bandit first, then go to Midnight Lord if you really have to.	2003-06-30

I don't know about you, but I wouldn't buy a book unless I know what it's about.  I took a risk with this one, since I love most of Nicole Jordan's books.  She's an awesome writer who gives romance books sensual characters full of passion and personality and the story always interesting. I like to collect books written by my favorite authors, so this is a worthwhile item to keep.  However, I don't think it's her best book she written.  It seemed to go in circles, and too longwinded of a book to read.  I thought I would never finish the book.  At times, it was hard to pay attention to the book.<br />REVIEW:  Alysson Vickery--wealthy, beautiful, and wildy rebellious--leaves France to go to an exhibition with her uncle to a war-torn Algiers regardles of her fiance's arguement of wanting her to stay due to her safety.  She gets kidnapped by Jafar, a Berber sheik who wants to use Alysson as bait for her fiance and his army to lead into a battle with his clan.  Jafar finds Alysson's fiance responsible for his parents' brutal death.  Alysson defies Jafar anyway she can and tries to get her freedom.  They both have a strong attraction towards each other, yet they have to control their passion for one another.  They both learn the person within each other as well as resolving emotional pain.<br />My thoughts on the book:  Like I said previously, the book is long-winded.  The characters are great, but the story needs work.  It drags in certain places.  If you want this as a collection, you should get it, however I suggest you shop for a lower price at different places as well as here.  I hope this review helps.	2003-04-10

If you have read other books by Lorraine Heath, then you know that this is a worthwhile book.  I haven't been disappointed yet in reading her books, old or new.  Each reader has their own tastes in what they like and dislike in a book.  I bought this book despite the negative review received for this book; and I am glad I purchased it, for now I have this book to add to my Lorraine Heath collection =o)  <br />This is a heartfelt story about a man who has to challenge himself to overcome his weakness and a woman who gets her dream of being a schoolteacher unfulfilled. Even though, Meredith has a hard time trying to dislike Lee, his smiles and his caring personality wins her heart.  Lee overcame his weakness of school by teaching the kids a different approach of learning. Although Meredith is strict with how a teacher should teach and lectures Lee to follow the guidebook, she becomes less strict and sees the value of learning differently rather than one way. From the first time they met, Lee has been drawn to Meredith. They help each other deal with their weaknesses, and grow closer together.  Not only do they fall in love with each other, but fell in love with an orphan boy who also had problems with learning as Lee has.  Meredeth has grown all her life as an orphan and knows how Jimmy feels: to belong to someone who loves them.  Lee showed Jimmy and Meredith about the value of love, family, and belonging.<br />A uniquelly written story to touch your heart.  You can see the characters are passionate, funny, and compassionate.  This is not a heady passionate romance book, but it has its own unique depth.  Not only do you feel for the story, but you feel for the characters.  It shows different perspectives viewed from 3 characters rather than having a book focus on one perspective.<br />If you are contemplating on buying this book, I would say get it, you dont' see these types of books often.  Ifyou haven't read books written by Lorraine Heath, read them all,they are all great.   However, like I said before, each person has their own taste in reading material.  But chances are if you like one book by Lorraine Heath, You'll like her other books gauranteed.<br />The reason I bought this book is that it's great to see the beginning of an author's work in her books, and from the start, Lorraine Heath writes from the heart and touches the heart of her readers by the stories written as I see in this book.  This is one of her books when she first wrote in her book career.  What can I say, it's well done.  Now I have to get the other series from Sons and Daughters to see how the other characters do in their labor when they turn 20!	2002-12-12

I would disagree with the previous comment, I think Connie Mason is getting better.  She captured both Vanora's and Lionheart's emotions and personality perfectly.  Lionheart appreciated and loved Vanora's bold, independent spirit which brought out his love for her in the end. Vanora fell in love with him after she sees how tender he is to her when in the past she has seen and felt the ruthless behavoir of men who tried to rule her land and herself.  Connie Mason wrote this in a great historical time and place.  I hope she writes more books similar to this book!<br />It's a worthwhile entertaining book to read and to keep as a collectible.  Have plenty of time to read this book, it will have you glued to the pages! =o)	2002-11-04

It was hard to stay interested when it went back and forth from past to present.  It is different, yet the author didn't make good transitions when she went from present to past then back to the present.  This book would have been written better and a good tone if the past history was done in prologue and the present afterwards. The book did give a sense of hot and cold relationship between Honoria and James as well as the past and the present.  Yet it is hard to believe Honoria's love for James at the end, when throughout the book she couldn't stand him and disliked him.<br />My advice, buy it used if you have to, it's not worth the full price you pay for it.  I couldn't read this book a second time, so not much of a keeper.  This is more of a drama/fiction book than romance.	2002-11-04
US	51744606	R2TSKUKUU3SEOC	0515118044	845135086	Always to Remember	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Well-done and unique	Lorraine Heath definitely makes her books unique and well done.  Always to remember is similar to Sweet Lullaby in that the point of view is mostly through the eyes of a male.  A touching story about a man, Clay, who comes back from war and branded a coward because of his choice not to fight.  He suffered through the years during and after the war.  He comes back, and the townpeople are outraged that he had the nerve to come back when others died fighting for the Cause.  One of them is Meg who decides to punish Clay for his cowardness by building a statue for the town.  Yet, Meg later turns her hatred into love when she realizes that Clay is a compassionate, caring man.  <br />If you have read Lorraine Heath's books, this is one to keep as a collection.  It's a great story to warm your heart.  If you haven't read her books, you are missing out!  All her book are awesome and must have's, especially Texas Splendor(heart-warming and will touch your heart)	2002-09-19

Wren is an amusing spirited woman who knows what she wants.  She goes after her dream and want to follow her acting in the theater.  She is tired of doing what others want her to do or be.  She defies her parents and takes acting lessons.  Cord, an old friend of the family, guards her while proving to others and himself of his innocence of a suspended case.

In that, instead of the usual act of selfless love and dedication mostly done by women characters, it is the man who displays these emotions and actions.  An average guy who falls in love with a beautiful woman who doesn't notice until after their marriage of a few months.  He loves her unconditionally even though she was pregnant with another man's seed and in love with the man who deserted her, the opposite of Jake, handsome and self-absorbed. It was heart-warming to see how Jake's character was displayed throughout the book.  You can feel his pain when he goes through pain and letting go of his love. <br />I admire Jake for his unconditional love towards Rebecca even though she doesn't return those emotions back til later when she chooses her life to be with her love who deserted her.  I think the book would have been better if Rebecca had more of a stronger character.  She doesn't really give a reason to her love for Brett except perhaps the physical attraction.  She doesn't fight for her marriage to work, and leaves so that she could be with Brett.  If she had a stronger character, she would have realized from the start that Brett wasn't the man for her, especially when she catches a naked woman in his bed!  But she ignores that incident, and accept's his infidilities.  She then realizes her love for Jake, and comes back. Jake was appreciated more in the story and others see his unique strong character to admire and want, how could Rebecca turn him down for someone who she felt physically attracted to?  I am pleased with Lorraine Heath's writing, she's a great writer!  My favorite and I would highly recommend is Texas Splendor, an awesome heart-felting romance.	2002-09-15
US	51744606	RTM82V1TP64I4	0440226384	823736786	Brazen Heiress	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Dry reading	I've read most of Elizabeth Boyle's books, and &quot;Brazen Heiress&quot; is not her best, it's dry, and lacking.  They could have put more into her relationship with Web, have more personality to draw them near besides the obvious physical attractiveness towards each other.  This book isn't much of a romance book to expect.  Right when you see Lily's passion for Web and vice versa, the passion unraveled later lasted only a page, not that passionate at all for the readers to view or realize the true extent of their love for each other.  I was hoping to see more of their passion of each other after reading the prologue, but I was left disappointed.  I will say though that this book would probably go better if she made this into a drama/mystery/spy book since she focused more on the spying than on the romance department.	2002-09-14

Karen Hawkins brought a nice contrast between Anna and Charlotte against Anthony.  It was nice to see a little change with that, so it wasn't an easy pairing if he were to be with Charlotte. I agree, Karen Hawkins should have at least concluded the development of Richard, why he won't talk, and if he progressed at all.  But the kids were were a nice touch to the book.  I can't wait for the next book to come along!	2002-08-29

The characters are well developed, and Hannah Howell did a great job on the plot.  The only thing is that the love that Storm felt for Tavis came to early in the story, yet didn't really give a reason to why she loved him. It's easy to see how everyone could love Storm, I was moved when she got beaten up by Sir Hugh and her stepmother.  I don't see how Tavis could have accepted his exmistress back into the castle nor could I see how he could have gone back to kissing her after she told Sir Hugh of Storm's whereabouts in which she was captured and beaten badly. <br />All of Hannah Howell books are great, if u havent' read them, go buy them, you won't be disappointed.	2002-08-28

A little twist in the story.  Not as passionate as her other books, but worth reading.	2002-08-27
US	51744606	REFY9JKGF4LFP	0380778319	842433769	The Warrior	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Great book, disregard negative feedback	I think this is a great book that Nicole Jordan has written. She fit the characters to the history it was written in.  She did an OUTSTANDING job in showing how women were treated back in that time when life was harsh and men led hard lives.  Of course, a woman in the 20th century can't live in that history of time, because it would have been cruel and degrading.  It would have been badly written if women were treated soft and sweet back then, that would not fit at all, cuz obviously she has done plenty of research to know how people were treated in each generation of time.  Women were not treated well back then, they were just a bargaining tool to get land and power.  This book is different from the soft, light romance books, yet it's great because you can see the raw strong passion that they have towards each other.  I enjoyed seeing their strong will clashing, and how they both defend their loyalties and beliefs.  Just read it for itself and don't compare it to another history in time, because each generation women were treated differently.  It progressed better through time.  If you enjoyed Catherine Coulter's &quot;Lord of Hawkfell Island&quot; and Johanna Lindsey's &quot;prisoner of my desire,&quot; then you will enjoy this book.	2002-08-23

Even though Edward married Lindsay out of revenge it later turns to love and passion. Lindsay has a stepbrother who kills her brother, yet she doesn't display any emotions of hate towards him, she just tries to distance herself from him. She is an innocent woman through and through, and that is what draws Edward to loving her.<br /> The book defitely has a twist in the end, which makes the book a good read.  I wish Stella Cameron wrote more historical romances.	2002-08-22

After years of mistrust from the noble women, he puts the same mistrust to Arienne. Ariene is loyal and a faithful woman who tries her best to proof her father's innocence of being traiter to the crown.  Even though Ranulf wanted to treat Ariene like any other women, he treats her differently and has a strong passion for her that he can't ignore.  Both have strong-wills and insecure with each other's emotions til the end.<br />I thought this was a great book that Nicole Jordan wrote.  It fits the history it was written in.  If you like light and soft historical books, then this isn't the book for you.  This is different, and if you like that as I do, then you'll enjoy it. This is something you can't compare one time in history to another, if so you'll find this book to be lacking and evil as the previous opinion person does.  If you read it by itself, then you'll like it.  If you had read Catherine Coulter's \\"Lord of Hawkfell Island\\" or Johanna Lindsey's \\"Prisoner of my desire\\" then you will like this book.  If you know the history that the book was written, then you'll understand how Ariene was treated harshly, and why Ranulf was very stubborn to not believe in Ariene.  Women were treated harsh, and men lived hard lives.  You can't always expect women to be treated in a nice way.  I coudn't put the book down til I was done.  Nicole Jordan put a lot of emotions in these 2 characters, and I enjoyed seeing their interaction with each other.  Great book.	2002-08-22

I've read most of S.Jeffries' books, but this one I find it truly lacking in a lot of areas.  Nothing in Sara's character compelled me to like her, even in the end.  She was annoying and irritating. Even Gideon said that a few times in the book! She's a little self absorbed with what she wants, she thinks for the women rather than let them have their say in what they want. As Queenie would call her, \\"high and mighty\\" she never saw it through the perspective of a convicted women, because she mostly was treated way better than the convicted women did, so what does she have to complain about? I would have been more compelled by her character if she actually went through what the convicted women went through in sleeping in the floor rather than in a private bed to herself. She didn't have much to complain about in choosing a husband since the men left her alone. Gideon does most of the compromises, yet she never thanked or appreciated his change of plans.  I was not convinced that she loved him as much as he loves her, all she did was take and he did all the giving!  All she made me feel was sorry for her because she couldn't accept the passionate side of her, and blamed it on Gideon for corrupting her to have .... She thought it was a mistake after their first night together, and felt guilty for having it, yet ten min later she goes at it with him.  Just shows how much she loves to complain in the book! This book wouldn't be so bad if Sara stopped complaining at a certain point, accept changes, and adapt to those changes for the women and herself. For a reformer, she isn't much of one, since she never made any changes to herself, yet expects other to do it for her.  I don't see her changing as a character should, she remains the same spoiled person she was in the beginning.  I would suggest you read S. Jeffries other books,and pass this one.	2002-08-16
