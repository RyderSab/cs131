It is merely a boring, dry, wordy, repetive, confusing (and confused) compilation of web-services related topics.<br /><br />The authours might be good programmers maybe, but as they are clearly very poor technical authors.. their writing style is boring, excessively wordy and abstruse.<br /><br />Not clear and concise enough to be useful as a reference and absolutely terrible as a tutorial.<br /><br />The preface tells how the idea of writing this book came form one of the authors who, sitting in a pub with the others was the the only one who wasn't drinking. I have some advice for this guy: start drinking.	2005-09-21

Be warned though, tit has the wrong title. (that's why I give it 4 star instead of 5). It should be called<br />Head First SCWCD and not Head First Servlets & JSP, since the scope of this text is to prepare you for the SCWCD exam, and it succeeds in that brilliantly. As a first book to learn Servlets & JSP programming though, I think it is a terrible, if funny, book.<br />In fact it is very good on conceptual matters and especially on the tricky casees and questions that you might encounter in the exam, but it lacks the hands on and by example approach necessary to learn how to actually DO things.<br />[...] This said, it is still a great book if you intend to refresh or improve your Servlet and JSP knowledge, or to actually take the exam and get certified.<br />Only , please, enough with this style, let's find another funny one, if I read another Java book with martial arts characters in it I will feel sick ! ;)	2005-09-19

Absolutely not recommended unless you have never programmed before and want to start getting your feet wet with a cheap book. But remember this book won't teach you C++.<br /><br />For the real things I recommend \\"Absolute C++\\" by walter Savitch (notwithstanding the scary title is a very friendly text..)<br /><br />or Professional C++ by N. Solter, or for one that s very good and very cheap, \\"C++, A beginner's guide\\" by Herbert Schildt.	2005-09-18

The theory and explanations in this book are sometimes decent but more often than not quite lacking. (es: in one of the first chapter the author uses Bresenham algorithm without taking the time to explain it). The use of tile based examples introduce unnecessary overhead, and the continuos attempts to introduce physics related code and references to the author's other book on game physics are just plain annoying. The range of subjects covered is very broad (chasing and evading, pathfinding, emergent behaviours, rule based reasoning, bayesian networks, neural networks, fuzzy logic, finite state machines, genetic algorithms), definitely too broad to treat each of these subject in decent depth and with clarity. Example code is of low quality and just superficially object-oriented. If you are looking for a decent introduction to game AI I recommend Matt Buckland \\"Programming Game AI by Example\\" and \\"AI Techniques for Game Programming\\".	2005-07-17

One of the most interesting application of CSS, layout management without tables, is relegated to the last chapter and receives just a cursory treatment. Also be warned that half of the book is dedicated to basic HTML tags which you should really be already familiar with unless you have lived in a cave for the last 10 years. Don't buy this book if you are interested in design. It is not a bad book after all, if you are totally new to the subject and looking for an easy and direct introduction just to get your feet wet, but from an author of the caliber and reputation of Molly  Holzschlag I was expecting something more inspired and inspiring. My advice is stay clear form this book and use freely available web tutorials if you really need some material now, and wait till \\"CSS Hands-On Training\\" by Eric A. Meyer comes out. That should be the right book to give you decent training and inspiration on CSS.	2005-07-10

This book starts very well with a practical, easy to follow, step-to-step introduction to regular expressions and their use with Java. This is to be appreciated since regexp are a complex subject that can easily be presented in an intimidating and obscure way. The problem is, this books never soars over this elementary level and in the end leaves you a bit disappointed even if you are totally new to the subject. The book is small and there are lots of white spaces, repetitions and not so useful discussions. I am under the unpleasant impression that the author and publisher realized the book lacked some meat and tried to cover up for it. It can still be a useful text if you want a really gentle intro to regexp usage in Java, but be warned that it lacks a serious and convincing treatment of regexp syntax. You will come out from this book with the ability to use regular expresisons only for really simple cases.<br /><br />The subtitle should be \\"a light intro to java.util.regex engine\\" and not certainly \\"taming the java.util.regex engine\\".	2005-07-03

If you are intererested in coding intelligente agent that can move around, flock, swarm, hunt and flee or follow a basic sort of strategic behaviour this text is an excellent choice. It offers practical examples examples of all of the above in the context of a simple soccer game and a search & destroy game called raven. Don 't expect 3D and fancy graphics. All games and concepts are 2D and the graphics is rudimentary at best, but that serves the puropose of keeping teh complexity of the book to manageable levels and the focus on AI programming. There is ton of example code to study and play with, and the little theory in the book basically is just an explanation of the code that the author has written. I would have liked to see more space dedicated to theory, and clearer and more genral explanations instead of \\"here is the code that..\\"  but oh well better too much practice than too much theory.. and after all the book title makes it clear that this is a hands-on kind of text.<br /><br />Definitely a must have book for the aspiring AI programmer or hobbist. Code is C++ but you don' t need to be a C++ guru, knowing the basics will serve you fine. Only one warning: you won 't get much out of this book is you don't spent a lot of time tinkering with the code presented and trying to extend it.	2005-06-30

For those who are still interested in dear old lean and mean C++ in these days of Java and C# this is an excellent second book (assuming the first was a good one ;) If you have mastered the basics of C++ this book will gently introduce you to the power of the Sandard Template Library teaching you how to use vector, list, deque and all the other containers and how to manipulate them with STL algorithms. You will also get a tutorial on how to extend STL. Written by a master of the language, it has a clean, efficient, lean and mean style... just like C++.	2005-06-24

You can buy any book by these two dudes with your eyes shut. I would have loved to see more new material in this second edition, especially on Seam and EJB integration in general. The book being so similar to the first edition there is little need for you to buy it if you already own the previous one.<br />The chapter on custom JSF tag development will be well over your head if you are reading the book as a first intro to JSF, and the LDAP material is pretty brutal and useless for a newbie to the subject, the chapter on opens source miscellanous frameworks is way too sparse to be useful beyond a little inspiration to learn more, but the rest of the book is top notch and will greatly help you to understand the JSF framework deep down to the bone.<br />The monkey wrenching title is not really about the book but about my feelings towards the development of java web development (forgive the horrible pun). First there were servlets, then JSP then EJB then Struts then JSF then Seam then Facelets then Shale...Am I the only one who feels that stacking framework over framework is going definitely overboard and leading us to do \\"frankenstein programming\\"?

Exasperating... this is the only word I can find to describe this insult to the writing art. It could be forgiven only if it was the work of a budding 14 years old aspiring writer.. The characters are stereotypical mannequins monstruosly bumping aroud in a shallow, totally unrealistic plot devoid of any originality. The Harvard professor is shy and reserved, the english lord is snob and the french cryptologist.. well she is hot! Inconsistencies and blunders are scattered all over the place, and leave you in this strange state when you don't know if you want to throw the book away in a fit of rage or have a great laugh at such an helpless author. The Harvad professor and the cryptologist together have the brain of a turnip, fighting hard to solve little riddles that would be a joke for kid. But what made really burts with laughter was the choice of the super secret passord that should have securely guarded the cryptex (basically a bycicle lock) containing the precious Holy Grail secret.. the Gran Master chose his grandaughter's name! Anyone who has even a slight familirity with security knows that a loved person name is the first and most obvious and stupid password choice of a dummy! :)<br /><br />Another comical side is the attitude of Langdon and Sophie towards feelings and sex... when you read that Sophie has interrupted all contact with her beloved grandfather you imagine all sort of violent things..murder.. pedophily, ..rape and it finally turns out she just caught him giving a \\"ride\\" to a middle aged plump lady? Coooooome on!!!! And ok, you had to have a couple to make the story just a bit more stereotypical.. but at least make something reaistic, comlex and deep happen! No, by the end of the story Langdon and Sophie share only a timid kiss \\"full of promise\\". Is the author a teenager or just trying to win the favours of the neo-con prude wave?<br /><br />And the final blow.. at the end of all that road, the little secrets and passords and riddles.. there is nothing like the Grail but just a happy family reunion!

The publisher would have shown much more business sense if it had taken time for a really solid book on Hibernate 3. The amount of typos and inaccuracies both in the text and in the code is staggering.

Here's the typical example of a \\"game development\\" rip-off book. Some amateurish programmer with no deep and solid game programming knowledge and absolutely no clue about how to effectively teach the little he knows has been playing around trying to implement his little game. Realizing his work is no good he stumbles upon the idea that he could scrap up a few bucks writing a book on what he is unable to do. Unscrupulous publishers aren't hard to find it seems: the leading champion being Premier Press, who has been a road opener to publishing trash game development books (and a few good ones, probably by accident). Now Wordware seems to have happily joined in the business...inside this book you will find countless pages in which the  author passionately reminisces about his teenager gaming habits, some general considerations about gaming and programming, and quite a few irritating jokes.And yes there is some working code coming with the book, but lost in his blabbering the author gives to it just a passing look and very shallow coverage. I understand that plastering a book with source code might not be the best tactic to teach programming, but exlaining only 5% of the code you present is even worse ...but certainly quicker and easier. That this peace of junk made it to the press is unbeliavable, and that its price was $40 is outrageous. My advice: stay clear from this title and from the upcoming (inevitable I guess) books from the same author.	2005-04-11

Don't miss this one	There are many, many book for the amateur or beginning game programmer around, but most of them stink, and for some reason the Java game programming ones stink even more! This book is an exception to the rule, and it is way over the average, especially compared with the other books in this very sloppy and superficial New Riders's game programming series. No tome fattening explaining the fundamentals of Java, just the raw meat of useful game programming techniques. Threading, full screen, Swing, double buffering, animation, a little 2D scroller, up to date NIO game networking, fundamentals of 3D graphics, BSP trees, AI, scripting...you will find all these cookies inside the book! The \\"level of detail\\" of course varies from subject to subject, do not expect a through , complete, super-extensive treatment, but all the subjects are covered in more than decent depth. I have only one  critique: The author's code doesn't use any form of 3D acceleration. I understand that this way the code can be more interesting.. as you are forced to learn more about what it takes to put a 3D object on the screen, but still software rendering is history now. The author is definitely too young and inexperienced to be a game programming guru, and sometimes his explanations are a bit vague and too \\"code-oriented\\", but he is definitely a very talented programmer and a good technical writer... on his way to gurudom! ;)	2005-03-03

Even if you are not convinced of the benefits of test driven development and unit testing you owe it to yourself to check what this is all about. This book will serve as a very hands-on introduction to a lot of APIs, libraries and techniques in the field of unit and integration testing. My only complaint is that it tries to cover too many subjects in too little space. The introductory part on JUnit is superb. I found the treatment of Cactus, surprisingly, too superficial (Vincent Massol is the cactus creator) : the author makes you first (after a brief interlude with Jetty) run the cactus test using Maven, and that would be ok with me if he gave a through introduction to this tool, but instead all you get is  a \\"run the tests typing maven cactus:test\\". Now this kind of monkey work is not what an intelligent developer loves to do.. and besides when things go even slightly wrong (and you know they will...) you are left clueless. You also get a chance to run cactus tests with ant but the treatment is not general enough to give you a solid understanding of this procedure. Anyhow after reading this book you will be much more competent on software development best practice and testing, but probably wondering if, having to learn and employ all these tools and APIs, unit testing is still useful or is monstrously transforming into  a heavy and complex part of your application...	2005-02-20

My only complaint is the presentation method: a bunch of code followed by a bunch of explanations.  I think presenting the more relevant lines of code interleaved with explanations and then the whole example program would make learning much more effective and easy. This book is also starting to show its age, so until a second edition comes out I would recommend the O'Reilly book over this one, unless you can get it real cheap.	2005-02-14

This book gives a very readable and clear overview of the main functionality of the Java Collections APIs and can make a decent introduction for someone just starting out with the language, but is definitely lacking depth and solid and interesting code examples and applications. So, I recommend the book only if you are a newbie to Java and data structures in general. Unfortunately, most of the books on Data Structures in the market will put you off with their pompuous academic style and horrible price, since they are created as textbooks to rip off CS students. A sound, detailed, no bs, up to date, code intensive technical text on the Java collections API is still sorely missing.	2005-02-12

Watching the steady decline of his enthusiasm and the gradual curbing of his hopes while he progresses through his PhD and postdocs makes a clear pictures of how helpful and nurturing academic life can be to the ones who dare to choose it. Isolation, extreme competition, lack of decent working opportunities and conditions and the need to \\"produce something\\" to sustain his academic career slowly disoriented and disgusted a truly passionate, talented and enthusiastic young physicist to the point that he found the business, money crunching world more intersting and pleasant!

It is just a lively written exposition of the workings of evolution and the subtle interactions that living creatures have among themselves. The focus of the book is on shifting the idea of evolution from species evolution and individual animal evolution to gene evolution. To be true, at the elementary level the game of survival, mutation and evolution is played by the genes and not the organisms, and this is a very important and interesting idea to behold. Sometimes Dawkins gets a bit carried  away by his \\"communicative genius\\" calling animal bodies \\"lumbering robots built by the genes\\" but at least he manages to catch the reader attention vey effectively. I personally don't understand his sectarian hostility towars group selection. To me, species, group, individual, kin and gene selection are all valid, they just tend to be the dominant force in different time/space domains. The only downside of the book is the smell of the petty disputes of the \\"specialists\\" in the field, which seemed to be quarreling more on words and way of seeing things than on real, sound, genuine ideas. This is the unmistakable sign of a stagnant field. I think that what makes some religious people snarl at this book is not its main idea (evolution is played at he gene level, and genes that are around today must have done well in diffusing at the expenses of others) but the very natural explanation it gives of selfishness and altruism (they help a single gene or a pool of similar or identical genes to survive and spread), something that religious people see as too \\"God-related\\" to be subject to biological explanations... Overall a a great book that will spark your interest in biology, genetics, ethology, sociobiology and even apparently unrelated fields like game theory.f similar or identical genes to survive and spread), something that religious people see as too \\"God-related\\" to be subject to biological explanations...

Ever had the feeling that there is something terribly wrong with the way society works and most other people think and live? Ever felt exploited, or even worse, felt that the only way you have to get on well in this world is to exploit others? You will find a delightfully subtle potrait of this experience in the history of poor Bardamu, first tossed in a war as \\"cannon meat\\", then in colonial africa as a corporate slave, then in the consumistic, maddening, squallid american society and finally involved in the every-day miseries of his own french society. In his cynical voyage he shows you the bestiality of war, the obtusity of the myriads of men that let themselves be<br /><br />sent to death for the wealth of of a few privileged ones, the savage exploitation of colonial africa, the obscene vulgarity and mechanization of american society and the horrors that hide behind the calm facade of burgeois society and yet under it all you can sense a subtle vein of gentle idealism and regret.<br /><br />From youth to old age, look at life of a potentially good man, whose good nature and quest for a meaning in life have been thwarted by our disgustig \\"human society\\". And all in the words of a true master of the language. I strongly recommend it to young people, as an true eye-opener and to \\"prepare them for life\\". As for who considers it dated...even a cursory look at central africa today, or at at the Iraq war will quickly prove how terrible actuality of this book.	2004-12-09

Stay far from this one if you need to learn Java from scratch. (Go for one of the many excellent intro books by Ivor Horton or Cay Horstmann). Not surprisingly this book is one of the best in the series, being mostly the effort of Brett McLaughlin who, besides being a talented coder and writer is also the man behind the O'Reilly \\"developer notebook idea\\". In about 150 pages you will get plenty of working examples and clear, concise explanations on the new features of \\"Tiger\\": generics (templates), varargs, annotations, autoboxing etc .. If you are a serious Java developer you cannot miss on these new features, and have no excuse for doing it since now you can bridge this gap with just a few hours of reading on a train. And if you are an old school C coder who grudgingly had to pass to Java for \\"marketing reasons\\".. I have great news for you.. believe it or not, we got printf back! ;)	2004-12-09

How? First of all from the visibility it got and secondly because there are people (like me) who wouldn't trade the pleasure of holding a good book in their hands with simply staring at a screen. So, go to Bruce Eckel's site (just make a search for  his name, you cannot miss it) download the book and code and decide for yourself if you are happy with the e-edition or want to buy the paper one. Either way do read it!<br /><br />You will get a through expositions of C++ syntax and inner workings, with explanations of why things are the the way they are. I especially liked the discussion of how virtual functions are implemented which isn't really essential to use the language but it does give more depth to your understanding and mastery of the language. If you need an even gentler introduction I would advise to buy either the 97 edition of Herb Schildt (another C++ master) \\"Teach yourself C++\\" which you can get used for about $ 1 on amazon or Ivor Horton (the clearest and most patient teacher I have ever read from) \\"Beginning C++\\" which will give you and exhaustive tutorial even on the \\"c part\\".<br /><br />A couple warnings:<br /><br />1) You should have at least a basic knowledge of C before reading this book.<br /><br />2) This is a book on the core part of language, not on a particular compiler or platform. So you won't find info on Borland C++ or visual C++ .NET<br /><br />The only issues I have with this book are:<br /><br />1) The typesetting on the book is the same you have on the html edition (quite crappy) and for book that costs more than 30 bucks this is unacceptable.<br /><br />2) Solutions to selected exercises are available but \\"for a small fee\\".

As the author says, last time I looked Java still had the +, -, /, *  and % mathematical operators.. though most programmers end up forgetting it lost as they are in the boring, vulgar and repetitive coding of boiler-plate \\"enterprise\\" (read \\"sell sell sell\\") applications. This book does a very good job of introducing a Java programmer to one of the most fun and interesting powers that Java can offer ... that is playing with numbers and exploring the world of mathematics. Forget (at least for a little while) Servlets, JSP, EJB, and database massaging... and give  a look to how you can use your JDK to study functions, solve differential equations, integrals, system of equations, discover prime numbers and admire the beauty of fractals. The  treatment of the various subjects is done is sufficient detail to be clear and sound, but without burderdening the reader<br /><br />with detail and depth best left for more specialized and hard-core texts that the curious reader can explore after this one.

Indeed this book, as said in its preface, came out in \\"cell-phone time\\", (that is, very quick) but unfortunately also in \\"cell-phone-quality\\" (that is, very poor). It is an incoherent puzzle containing disparate info about EGL, some basic considerations about OpenGL ES functionality, audio for mobile devices, fixed point math and advertising for a few commercial game engines. If you think that looking hard enough you will find at least some info on how to choose and configure your development environment, to see working code for some basic functionality and maybe a little game.. well you are sadly mistaken. Another \\"book\\" hastily put together to make a few extra bucks at the expense of the unsuspecting reader.  Buy only if love rough toilet paper.	2004-10-30

At the end of the book you certainly won't be a Hibernate expert but at least you will know enough to start playing with it and decide if you want to go farther. Writing style is concise but clear enough, and gets a little confusing only in the two central chapters on richer associations and enumerated types. Overall I like the dev notebook style, but I think that 50 pages more used for more clarity and examples would have made it perfect.	2004-10-28

It is basically a review of the code of a few simple games (like a cowboy jumping tumbleweeds, or a simple 2d maze) with very little space devoted to theory and explanations.. both of the APIs and of the internal logic and algorithms.  Not that this book isn't useful.. it is but you have to wade through a lot of code, and I think the author could have done a much better job if for example she had taken the time to EXPLAIN the maze generation algorithms instead of just saying \\"look at the code\\". In short, more time and effort on the author's side, less on the reader.. and I think this book was written in very little time and with very little effort.	2004-10-25

Design patterns are  cool, indispensable, useful ways to combine objects to build better OO programs. (Here better means basically more clear, extendable, maintanable, and elegant). Now, this is the book that started the design patterns \\"frenzy\\" and this is of course both good and bad, since in this frenzy some folks start to forget that good OOP ins't only about design and that design patterns are simple ways to combine object and not rocket science.<br /><br />Anyhow... this book is not very good as an introduction to the subject, due to its  dry and sometimes obscure style.<br /><br />It is a very good read though for someone who has already read a more tutorial-like book (like \\"Design Patterns Explained\\" or the excellent \\"Thinking in Patterns\\" that you can download for free at Bruce Eckels's site) and wants to see them explained again from the \\"masters\\".  This book<br /><br />is extraordinarily useful and important, you cannot go without reading it if you are an OO programmer.. but still I wish that the style was simple and down to earth.<br /><br />Most of the sample code is given in C++ but you don't need to be a C++ pro to read it. Some is in Smalltalk.. mmmm and that was definitely a bad idea .. but you can just skip it without losing anything.	2004-10-02

I find that game-programming is one of the most fascinating and well, fun<br />area of programming and CS in general.. so any effort in this direction is welcome to me.. but I have seen too many titles from this publisher who were too superficial to do any good, or just plain rubbish. This title stands out for the professionality and competence of the author and for the level of detail and completeness of presentation.  If you are a programmer with decent C/C++ skills, a curiosity about how games like Diablo work, and a LOT of patience and enthusiasm for game programming by all means get this book. It won't enable you to write the next episode of Diablo or Dungeon Siege but still if you work your way through it studying carefully the text and especially the code presented, in the end you will know enough to create a small<br />2D/3D adventure game on the diablo style.<br />Beware this book is thick and dense, and will take time to absorb  but you cannot help it if you want to learn something interesting and enjoyable about game programming.<br />The second edition is coming out, probably updated to the latest<br />release of DirectX, so watch out for it!	2004-06-16

The idea behind this book is a very good one: teaching patterns avoiding excessive formalisms and with a hands on approach. I had great expectations from this title which were only partially met.<br />The book content is sound and some of the patterns are explained in a decent way, but the workbook approach fails as most of the questions are unclear or just too trivial. I find the choice of using a firework factory to work out all of the patterns weird at best.. it makes for a very boring sequence .. fireworks might be fun to see but who cares to learn about star presses, fuses  and chemical batches? Besides squeezing all of the patterns in a single context makes for a very forced result. And how about all the swing code thrown in without a real reason? It is just distracting. The author is certainly competent, and a sharp programmer, but he could not resist the typipcal geeky tendency of making things more complicated than they really are by throwing into the discussion basically everything he likes or knows about... parsers, state machines, swing, recursion, object models etc etc.. not to mention the damn fireworks.. ! ;)<br />I am still looking forward to a book that offers a clear , no frills explanation of design patterns and presents for each pattern a series of ( a lot of ) examples from different context. That is what is n eeeded to absorb good object oriented design and patterns.. simple, clear explanations and practice, practice, practice. Meanwhile, before you go for  \\"the book\\" (Design Patterns by Erich Gamma, et al ) I would recommend reading<br />Design Patterns Explained by Alan Shalloway.	2004-06-14

The price to pay is some of the explanations end up being rather superficial. I like the practically oriented attitude of the book and the wealth of examples, from basics to more complex. Do not expect this to be a book that will transform you from a complete openGL newbie to a master... but it a very good introduction for somone who needs to make sense of openGL and see it at work. It uses GLUT as a library to interface with OS specific command like showing windows or getting keyboard input to shield you from having to deal with the dreaded windows API or any other OS dependent functions. If this is a good or bad thing , you decide. You will have to \\"treasure\\" the CD coming with the book as you will have no chance to download the source code form the web.

This book won't leave you alone on the intricacies of marrying physics and computer programming and will make your programming activity more intereesting if you are more of a programmer and you physical studies more rewarding and less<br />\\"pen-and-paperlike\\"  if you are an aspiring physicist. In fact I highly recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in how nature works and in playing with computers. The extreme clarity of this book makes it accessible to junior colege students and even to advanced, motivated high school students or for self study. I would have preferred to see the example code in the book<br />in C or better C++ but using BASIC has the advantage of making the book more esy to read and is just sligtly annoying for the<br />C++ or Java programmer. ( Are there any other kind of real programmers? ;) Just make sure you master your language enough to make calculations, use functions, and are able to produce at least some basic graphics (using C++ and openGL or DirectX would rock).

Now this is definitely what I would call advanced topics.. but even if you are a beginner it is nice to read about them just to figure out what these mysteriously sounding entities are ;)<br />My only grudge with this book is that it is quite a little one.<br />Lenghtier explanations and a few more examples would could really benefit the beginner.. especially since like for many books of this kind the author is more a programmer than a technical author or tutor so the writing style is pretty much like: here are the basic points about the theory and here is the program I wrote to show you how it works. So you won't get much from this book if you don't dig a lot in the code. The difference with many  other similar book on the market is that the author gives you at least some good assistance into it.	2004-04-18

As such it could have been written only by two first class scientific minds and masters of physics like Taylor & Wheeler. The thing is... great scientist tend to have a distorted sense of what is fun and, more important, what is easy...Some points in the book could have been explained in a clearer and less wordy way. I find the author's obsession with trying to explain everything geometrically a bit disturbing. But don't get me wrong, this text is a great accomplishment as it manages to give a clear,  effective introduction to one of the most puzzling areas of physics, without burdening you with heavy math and tons of formulas. And what is most important, it makes you understand that in physics what is important is .. IDEAS.. not terse expositions, formulas, mathematical rigor.. as important as they are as aid to express ideas and obtain results.<br />Definetely a recommended read for anyone with a serious interest in special relativity.

An excellent read for someone who has just learned how to program in an object oriented language and wants to progress to the next level. The strong points of this book are: it is very clear, to the point and gives a broad coverage of all relevant problems and techiques in software development. Weak points: it is way too espensive, it could be more in depth in some areas, and it would benefit from the addition of a few chapters on how to use CASE tools.

Beware that Simone's mind had a strong tendency for<br />abstraction so you won't find here lots of juicy details, or a sequence of emotional adventures like in Rousseau's Confessions.<br />Principles, abstract thinking and reflexion had a great weight<br />in Simone's life and this book is principally the biography of her mind.

Let's be honest.. how many of us are absolutely sick of dry, boring texts that try to sell you ejb technology and themselves as they were rocket science? Most computer related books nowadays are ridiculously formal and dry. Is this the way to attract the interest of students or new developers? I don't think so, and neither do the authors of this book. This text is both a good intro to EJB and an example of how to teach. So it will be useful for both the novice programmer and the expert one who is involved in teaching or mentoring. Be warned that this book is really \\"different\\" so if you are kinda stiff and find it disconcerting to have lots of images scattered along the text<br />and like to concentrate only on the \\"essential raw matter\\" this<br />might not be the book for you. A fine example of the fact that only really serious people are not afraid of being funny...	2003-12-22

Wrox books had the<br />habit of being no BS, clear, hands-on, detailed techical tutorials.. and this is why they had their original success. But now, perhaps in conjunction with being bought by Wiley, Wrox is definitely going down. The authors of this book souns like IBM managers, not certainly programmers. The first chapters do not contain ANY techical info but just advertising for IBM products (I am not making this up..!)<br />The rest of the presentation is a confused, disorderly, bloated,<br />verbose, unnecessarily complicated sequence of \\"click here and then click there\\" instructions. If you have some brains this book will be unbearable, if you have none, well you're probably one of the authors.<br />What is most irritating and annoying about this book is the pompous, monotonous, slow tone  aimed at passing straightforward<br />technical notions for rocket science, which unfortunately seems to be a general trend at IBM.	2003-12-15

It touches both the practical<br />side of women's condition and the more subtle sociological and psychological issues that<br />explain the whys and hows of their condition. It is not an \\"agry\\" book againts males, but a<br />very balanced analysis that puts the blame for discrimination both on the arrogance and hypocrisy<br />of the dominating male gender and on the passive acceptance that women often offer in exchange<br />for indulgence and \\"adoration\\". I wish I could say that this book is now old and outdated, but having lived<br />both isn the US and Italy, I must say that its content is very much actual and relevant today in<br />both countries. Don't think this book is hard to read. It will be hard only if you are one of those<br />persons wwo have lost the ability and habit of thinking (too much TV maybe?) This book WILL make<br />you think. Remember that this is no boring essay but some arid sociologist but the work<br />of a great artist and as such will touch on philosophy, and on a deep view of human character,<br />desires and aspirations. Another very strong point of this book is the beautiful writing style<br />of Simone, so if you have even a basic grasp of French try by all means to read in its original language.	2003-12-06

What I do not like: explanations are not clear at times (what boggles me the most is that the most confusing part is on the use of the validator, an area in which one of the authors is a commiter..!). Also the style of the books is pretty much like this.. here are a couple basic notions and consideration about the new subject, here is a code dump of a toy application using these techniques, and finally a<br />really quick and superficial overviiew of the code. So apart from a  few simple concepts the only way to learn something from this book is to go dig in the source code, and even so you learn only how to do that thing.. not how to do things in general..and that is not my idea of a good tutorial.<br />Also, I would have loved to see coverage of XDoclet to produce configuration files...	2003-11-30

The style is concise but clear,<br />the code clean and simple, and compile and works perfectly.<br />Besides you will have clear, detailed explanation (not only directives or instructions)  on how to compile and run it.<br />As and added bonus, the books uses mainly Ant for building the examples so you can integrated this new knowledge nicely using the tools you should be using for your usual development projects in Java. I give it only 4 stars because the book title should be INTRO to J2ME development as the coverage is broad (forms, networking, persistent storage, evena  nice chapter on games!) but not terribly deep in any area. But if you are new to J2ME and hate wading through the docs buy this book and you will not regret it!<br />The price is reasonable, too.	2003-11-22

The only defect of this book is its unbelievable price... surely due to the fact that is used a college textbook so the poor students have no choice but squander their savings on it. Luckily the content is very good,<br />the teaching style is excellent ( the author uses macros initially to do input and output so you won't be overwhelmed by lots of material just to write and read from the keyboard, and after you have played a bit a learned the basics he goes on explaining them).  You can certainly read this book with no prior exposure to assembly and computer inner workings.<br />You 'better have at least some exp with a high level language,<br />and if you don't, why on earth do you want to start programming with assembly? Masochisms?<br />The one word that comes to mind about this book and author is CLARITY. It is certainly not a fun<br />read, but it is so clear that it is not boring.<br />Compliments to Richard and one star less than the max because of the rip-off price. (Get it used!)	2003-11-22

Cons: its vast breath is counterbalanced by<br />little depth. Ant 's coverage is appropriate to get you started working with it quickly, and to have you appreciate what this tool can do for you.

Very good programmers are often terrible authors.. as you will find out from both this book and the manning book on Struts. Having been written by Ant contributors and \\"junkies\\" it tends to be more of an \\"ant treatise\\" than a tutorial on how to use<br />it in the most common and useful situations. So buy it if you want a long and wordy description of of ant and all its quirks,<br />but you want lots of clean, short, to-the-point, easy to follow<br />examples you might get disappointed here.

I have been somewhat disappointed by the security chapter which is basically just an overview of the J2EE standard security model. Also, being a book \\"practice oriented\\" I would have loved to see details on the deployment of the source code presented. Overall a 3 and 1/2 star book that gets a little bonus for being simple and practical.<br />Previous knowledge of design patterns in general would certainly help you to get the most from this text.

Or you will have to do like all other newbies game developers.. hunt through lots of books and SDK documentations....<br />I am very disappointed because I had the impression that with this book Lamothe had stopped writing \\"fake, for dummies\\" books<br />useful only for his bank account and had taken the effort to write something less nice and easy  but \\"REAL\\"	2003-07-14

I am not kidding! That is 70% along the length of the<br />book!

I do praise Lamothe<br />for having showing that techical books don't have to be boring, but still very much prefer a boring<br />but instructive and complete text to an empty pretentious booklet.

Start here	The introduction to C++ part alone is worth the price of the book. I cannot think of a better way to make \\"first contact\\"<br />with C++ for someone who is really new to C++ and maybe to programming at all. The part on Windows programming is starting to be a bit dated (no .NET stuff here) but is well structured, informative and really step-by-step. The style of the book is teaching you by example developing a drawing-sketching application. You will find also useful info on building DLLs and database programming. Be warned this is not a book on MFC! If you are looking for a MFC through treatment and reference look elsewhere! But if you are new to C++ and want to see how it is used to build basic windows apps this book will definitely give you a great foundation.	2003-07-09

Ivor is a very, and I mean VERY good teacher, having the two most important qualities needed to teach effectively: clarity & patience. You will not find confusing and hasty  or \\"terse\\" (another word for cryptic)explanations here, but this comes to the price that sometimes<br />this text will be even \\"too clear\\" so you must be the type that<br />can appreciate a calm, relaxed pace and is not a fan of a \\"fast & furious\\" style. My personal opinion is that a little patience<br />is not a big price to pay to get a solid foundation ... but that is just my idea..<br />You should also note that this book will teach you the foundations of the language in detail and will touch on some of the APIs (xml, graphics) but it is not going to cover technologies like Servlets, JSP, EJB and with good reason since doing that would be insane in an intro book. Don't worry though, with Classes & Inheritance, Threads , Streams, Collections, Graphics and XML you will have more than enough to digest. To sum it up, do you prefer to learn Java by  a young, rampant, hasty, cocky young teacher or from a older, wiser one? Your choice.	2003-06-27

Beside explaining you that NN are built upon nodes and links and that nodes have values and links have weights, which you can probably figure out by yourself, it present NN rules and techiques without a word about why this is so. For example the formulas used to modify<br />the NN values during the training process are gives \\"as is\\", so<br />that you you must just copy them and use them without having a clue at what is going on. So why do I give it 4 stars? Because<br />it does have working source code, and not in some weird language<br />like Lisp but good old C++. C++ gurus might indeed have more than a grumble with the quality of the code, as it has some<br />glaring faults, both in style and concept (like attempting to inline virtual functions and poor distribution and organization of code among header and source files) but hey, it is very simple to understand, and it works! And that is already something especially for someone who is a beginner both in NN and C++. The NN described are ADALINE, Back Propagation NN, Self Organizing NN and Bidirectional Associative Memory, (in case this tells you something) but with a little work and study you can reuse part of the framework to create new architectures. I definitely prefer a book with working, explained code than a tome full of abstraction and algorithms whose implementation is left as an exercise to the (clueless) reader. At least with this book you can play with the code and see NN in action. To really understand what is going on though you will need a theory book. As a gentle introduction I recommend Fundamentals of Neural Networks, by Laurene V. Fausett	2003-06-27

If you are really interested in programming with EJB this is one of the books you should check, despite its many flaws.. The first three chapter make<br />a fully successful attempt to protect the mysteries of J2EE from<br />profane eyes by putting a deep sleep spell on the reader.<br />If you survive it you will probably find yourself wondering about the order in which the story is told...<br />First a hurried example involving a session bean collaborating with an entity bean, then one chapter on the client side (which of course you need to understand how the heck you could have tested the beans just developed), then entity beans get presented again but this time in more detail.. only you get to know first the CMP flavour (which is the more complicated) and the BMP flavour after, totally against what common sense would advice. Then you go into session beans, which , being simpler than entities should have been presented before..and how about a chapter 16 on deployment descriptors? They are the configuration files you need to deploy ANY EJB and you explain them at the end of the book? The impression is this author would be much better if he stopped thinking by compartments<br />and trying to make things appear much more difficult and deep than what they actually are. Also, the workbooks with the exercises for this text are a joke. You will be presented with<br />canned code and a few ant scripts to execute, compile, build<br />deploy and run the code. Very kewl but if you know what you are doing you can do it yourself and if you don't .. well clicking on a few batch files or executing ant scipts won't teach you much I can assure you..	2003-05-27

You might find all or a few of these in the zillions of servlet/jsp books around.. but you won't find a great teacher like Marty so easily.<br />That si probably due to the fact that this guy is not a code<br />munching corporate programmer but comes from an academic background.

Marty gives you the full story but makes it really simple, because, let's face it.. web developement IS SIMPLE even for the average programmer.. unless someone throws you a fuss of code snippets and incoherent or incomplete explanations.

I personally like to learn by example (is there another way?) and did like these examples even though I am no big fan of frameworks ( I prefer to start from square one so that I am sure I understand 100% of what I do and also feel that everything I do is exactly like I want it).<br />Unfortunately the book soon changes in an encyclopedic-style<br />review where examples are scarce to non-existent, explanations<br />very confuse ( I could check this lack of clarity and method looking at the presentation of concept that are absolutely familiar and clear to me like MVC or Tag Extensions or JSTL ..<br />well the book explanations were horribly dull and confusing )<br />and often to understand the subject presented you should have<br />knowledge of matters presented later in the book.<br />In conclusion I think this bok might be marginally useful to someoone starting out with Struts .. so if you find it on your colleague's desk open it.. but as for shelling out the $$$ to buy it.. you would be better off investing in ice-creams...	2003-04-04

Keep in mind that the treatment is superficial and also Barron is not a teacher but a programmer. This means that his way to explain things is just to walk you through some example code telling you what tis code does, but rarely explaining you why it is so and the possible alternatives. It is pretty much like having an experienced co-developer giving you a quick overview of his code to get you into a new project, but not like attending a class or a course. I have to say I might also show little enthusiasm because of the &quot;natural repulsion&quot; I get for any Windows code.<br />Am I the only one who wonders how a giant company like MS who certalinly has great developers working in it can produce such<br />downright UGLY design and APIs?	2003-03-22

As other readers have said it is a good SDL<br />primer (covering just the basics). Other APIS are mentioned but just ina cursory view. There is a whole chapter dedicated to the code of a sound player software whoch is really out of place here.. it looks more like the author stuffed it in since he for some reason had developed it and he thought it was marginally relevant.. A good point is the book is about a working 2D game, Penguin Warrion ( a spaceship against spaceship typical game ) but the game development is not properly explained.. it loks like the book is an appendix to the game and not the contrary... in short to really learn something you must go and scan the code on your own...<br />With a little bit more affort and time to give the book more depth and solidity it could have been a great beginner's text..too bad!	2003-03-13

I had been waiting for quite some time to get it as I was hoping to find an advanced treatment on automating the \\"practical\\" matters of ejb.. generating code but especially deploying on various application servers ( a topic that sadly most ejb books skip since it is \\"vendor dependent\\") and how to do all this the right way using JBuilder. This booklet turned out to be a weak introduction to ejb, that just teaches you the very, VERY basics and also in a hurried and superficial manner. And trust me I am not a snobbish theorist or a \\"I read-only-manuals-and-oreilly-books\\" kind of guy, and I know a good book when I see one.<br />The JBulder part is at best laughable: first of all, the code for the book was developed with JBuilder FIVE and the title says proudly 7...The difference doesn't show up much anywasy since the code examples are not even worth calling toy examples.. they are just snippets that could have bene put together by someone who started learning java last week. And as for deploying the examples, good luck man, you are on your own.<br /> Ah, did I mention that the first FIVE chaps are not even on ejbbut just the plain vanilla javabeans? Did I mention that the whole layount of the book and the style of writing reminded me of a high school student who uses the biggest possible Word fonts to fill up the required number of pages of an assignment when he is totally without anything significant to say?	2003-01-09

Arrington is an experienced teacher and his teaching proficiency shows all along the book. His style is very clear and sometimes repetitive, but that makes sure you get the idea through.<br />Being a &quot;hands on type of guy&quot; I like the fact that the book explains the theory in the context of developing and example application.<br />The UML &amp; Object Oriented Analysis section of the book is truly outstanding, while the implementation part leaves a bit to be desired. It is also outdated as it still uses HTML production classes inside Servlets and not JSP. The second edition should fix this.<br />Overall the best book on UML for a Java developer I have read so far.	2003-01-04
US	49450716	R3MV9ZSKX4KILA	0130894680	971975150	001: Core Java 2, Volume 1: Fundamentals (The Sun Microsystems Press Java Series)	Books	5	7	8	N	N	SOLID &amp; ELEGANT	I have read and browsed through quite some Java books and  I found this one particularly impressive. The style is a bit academic but very clear, concise but understandable. It just makes you feel that the authors should relax a bit, their only defect is they fail to convey the idea that Java is a beautiful language and programming can be fun.(Somehow you get the imprssion that they don't really like Java..). Anyways the material presented is great, the examples are solid but simple enough for you not get lost, and it is full of interesting complex points like reflection and inner classes that get finally explained in a clear and non pretentious way. It also has a lot of examples on Swing components, applets and file I/O. The second volume seems to be even better! This is one of the TWO best Java book. The other one is Beginning Java Programming by Ivor Horton. Buy Core Java if your priority is on style. Buy Ivor's book for a more pleasurable and more &quot;tutorial-like&quot; (but still solid) experience. If possible, buy them both!	2001-07-04
