It's not your typical marketing consultant book by any stretch of the imagination, after all, Naomi, is not of the Zyman, Reis, or Trout family of marketing writers.  Those guys write about Positioning, Focus, (excellent works by the way) and how the only thing that matters in marketing is selling more things to more people more often.  After reading Zymans \\"The End of Marketing as We Know It\\", you'd think there was nothing more important this world than getting people to consume until they explode or go bankrupt.<br />No Logo takes an entirely different tack.  Branding, yea, it gets it due here.  Most companies in the US don't make anything anymore.  They build brands; they don't build products.    Nike, whatever companies made the clothes on your back, or branded the computer you're reading this review on didn't sell you a product.  They sold you an image.  Maybe they sold your kids an image you finally broke down and bought at the expense of something else.  <br />Cash strapped schools are great place to set the brand hook early.  The kids might come home wired and fat from the Taco Bell lunches and Coke machines around every corner, moving one step closer to diabetes or heart disease every day.  These days maybe we should just be happy the brand are there to step in and help out where public funding no longer makes the grade.  As long as your kid isn't like Mike Cameron who got suspended for wearing a Pepsi shirt to school on \\"Coke day\\", there is nothing to worry about, right?<br />It's intuitive from the consumer side, particularly when we look around and see all the \\"stuff\\" we have for which there is really no need.  Brands rule, branding \\"works\\"; it gets people to buy more stuff more often at increasingly higher prices, often required to offset the cost of the branding campaigns.  <br />That's great unless yours is an industry that has or is in the process of outsourcing production of the actual material goods to an \\"Export Processing Zone\\" and your job entails some part of the production process.  If it can be made in an overseas sweatshop and shipped back over here, chances are it will be in the not to distant future.  It'll be interesting to see what effect the move to the brand based company has on the current and future economy of the US.<br />So maybe you think it's crazy (or not) that companies here spend billions just create images and perceptions to drive demand for products made elsewhere.  Image becomes everything, however, an image can also be extremely fragile. People in glass houses don't throw rocks anymore, the lawyers protecting those fragile brands do.  Sometimes it's shutting down fan sites or user groups on the net or trying to block the dissemination of informational leaflets that may not paint an ideal rosy picture of the brand.  As was the case with McDonalds in the McSpotlight case, some times the brands take a beating.  The glass house comes crumbling down.  Sometimes it just takes a few brave sould to stand up for what they believe in.<br />No Logo will make you think.  It might arouse a passion deep within to get involved and look for a ways to bring about change or affect your future career (hint - the money is in brand marketing!).  It ought to be required reading for any student of marketing, if for no other reason to provide a sense of balance and awareness of how marketing and branding fits into the business process these days.<br />If ya like No Logo, you might also be interested in:<br />** The Age of Access by Jeremy Rifkin<BR>** The Divine Right of Capital by Marjorie Kelly<BR>** Unequal Protection by Thom Hartman<br />and on the more pro business side<br />** \\"Positioning\\", a classic by Reis and Trout<BR>** \\"Focus\\", another outstanding marketing book by Al Ries	2003-05-20

This book puts search engine optimization in perspective.  If you've been looking at the web sites of search engine optimization firms and not been able to figure out what it is they do, this book will clue you in as to what you should expect to hear from a reputable company.  It may also be an eye opener if you think attaining top rankings in the main search results on engines like Google is as simple as breaking out the checkbook and paying some company to \\"do optimization\\" without making any changes to your website (though there are some companies that can pull this off for surprisingly long periods of time).  <br />Search Engine Visibility is the first book I've ever seen that acknowledges search engine optimization does not exist in a vacuum separate from the business or philanthropic goals of a website.  Search engine optimization should be an integral part of the planning and design stages of any website.  It's refreshing to see a publication that emphasizes this.<br />This book will help you understand what you can do to increase search engine referrals and further your business goals without spamming the engines. [Though if you take everything in this book literally you may be scared that if you put a few words in your meta tags that don't appear in the copy of your page Google will ban your site - that's just not going to happen, but you do put your site at risk if you resort to some of the other Spam tactics mentioned in the book]<br />You'll learn best practices in:<br />* Keyword research and selection<BR>* Site design and layout<BR>* Designing search engine friendly navigation systems<BR>* Crafting keyword (and user!) focused copy on your pages<BR>* Improving visibility for search engine \\"challenged\\" sites<BR>* Preparing for and doing directory submissions<br />The section on dealing with directories and directory editors is probably the best write up of the directory planning, submission, and listing process I've ever seen.  [This comes from one who has been one of those editors since 99']  It gives you very realistic expectations with respect to getting your site listed in the major web directories.  Follow the included guidelines and checklists and you can't go wrong. Chances are, however, it will take a fairly long time for your site to get reviewed and listed unless you expressly pay for an express review.<br />You won't find the minute technical details of how each engine works in this book and you don't need them.  All engines look at the link text and visible copy on your site as well as some combination of title, description, keyword, alt, and header tags.  Focus on the basics and you'll do just fine.  Keep your eye on your customers; a search engine spider will never buy anything from you.  <br />To round out your search engine optimization/marketing library be sure to pick up a copy of \\"NetWords\\", \\"Persuasive Online Copywriting\\", and a good book on style sheets (CSS) such as \\"Designing CSS Web Pages\\" By Christopher Schmitt or \\"Eric Meyer on CSS\\" <br />For more up to the minute info on search engine promotion pay a visit to the WebmasterWorld forums.	2003-02-11

To say the bookshelves are flooded with political fodder these days is an understatement.  Some blame the state of the nation on \\"Stupid White Men\\", others talk about \\"Winning the War of Liberty over Liberalism\\".  No matter where you look or what you read, the mudslinging is intense.  At times, these authors make EMINEM's rap \\"battles\\" with gangsters in the movie \\"8 Mile\\" look like an episode of the Mickey Mouse Club.<br />Unequal Protection, however, is not one of these books.  It is an historical documentary of sorts that traces the history of the corporation and its role in society from the East India Company, through the FORTUNE 500 of today.  It examines the people, actions, beliefs, and mistakes that have led to the extreme concentration of power and wealth among a select few global corporations.<br />While laying the foundation for the future of the United States, keeping power in the hands of the people and preventing institutions similar to the East India Company from gaining unlimited economic and political power was one of the key drivers.  For many years corporations were kept relatively well in check and responsible to the people and governments that granted them the right to exist.<br />The passage of the 14th amendment, intended to give all persons (not corporations) equal rights, combined with a ruling in single court case that has been mistakenly interpreted to define corporations as \\"persons\\" like you and me opened the door to all kinds of crazy claims by corporations.  <br />Subsequent claims and court rulings have directly and indirectly granted corporations virtually unbridled power through creative legislation and enabled some to operate with no consequences whatsoever for damaging and deadly actions.<br />\\"Unequal Protection\\" also discusses of NAFTA, which appears to have granted corporations the authority to override what people and sovereign nations have determined to be in their own best interest.  This may include protecting local jobs andeconomies, banning Frankenfoods with the potential to disrupt and/or destroy the food supply and outlawing toxic additives or chemicals known to have adverse effects on public health and the environment.<br />The pursuit of profit is a necessary and healthy part of a democracy and free market economy.  However, when it is the exclusive focus, to the detriment of the environment, the commons, and the health and well being of the people that make up societies and corporations, its time to take back the reigns.  When corporations factor in the human and environmental costs associated with doing business and can be held accountable for their actions will real change begin.  <br />Through the acceptance of corporations as persons in the legal sense, we've come full circle to facilitate and reward the types of actions and behaviors of the East India Company that this country originally fought so hard to get away from.<br />Unequal Protection is an outstanding work.  It's history with a perspective, but does not in any way sink to the political mudslinging ways of other books that may be classified in a similar category.	2002-11-17

It's not about winning awards for creativity, it may or may not make people \\"feel good\\", it is not a magic box, and it is not something that can be completely outsourced. That, in a nutshell is the gist of \\"The End of Marketing as We Know It\\". <br />This book is really nothing more than common sense (NOT necessarily common practice!), however, if you have been in the advertising/marketing word very long, chances are this book will be a breath of fresh air. In order to sell more stuff to more people, marketing has to focus on positioning and delivering messages that connect with real people, not the CEO or the folks that hand out advertising awards. It's got to show people what's in it for them, why they should buy your stuff, and why they should buy your stuff again, and again. <br />If you work in an environment that already thinks and work like this, this book may be a waste of your time. If you work in an environment that is developing campaigns for any purpose other than selling more stuff directly or supporting the sales function and making it effortless, this a book you need to read. If you are looking to hire a marketing consultant or an agency and don't know much about marketing, you need to view marketing as an investment in future sales revenue.

Tim details the early days of conceptualization of the web followed by the evolution to a research tool and onto the multifaceted web of today used for commerce, entertainment, research, communications and any number of other activities.<br />He begins with the early days of the web as a project at CERN, the difficulty getting people to conceptualize a worldwide network of hypertext, (how long did it take you to \\"get it\\" when you were first introduced to the web?) its tremendous growth and commercialization in recent years, and his vision of the future.<br />The book discusses the various interests that pull the web in different ways and the possibility of the development of a future \\"semantic web\\" in which a variety of standards and technologies combine to enable search engines to respond more intelligently to queries when people search for information on the web.<br />The case is made that research, commerce, communication, and any number of other activities has its place on the web and all serve to enrich the web as a worldwide network of communication and knowledge.  In order to continue to grow and thrive, there must be basic standardized protocols.  In addition, no one party should be vertically integrated and grow large enough to be able to control access, technology, and content such that it inhibits the free flow of information and global communication.<br />It would be tough to find a better figure to pioneer and contribute so profoundly to the development of the Internet and World Wide Web.  Had it been pioneered and developed on proprietary patented protocols and technologies; access, usability, and overall usefulness of the web would be nowhere near what they are today.<br />To gain an understanding of where the web came from, where it's headed, and how various companies, technologies and other interests may affect the future development of the web; pick up a copy of \\"Weaving the Web\\".	2002-09-02

Your life is part of a larger drama.  As you grow up you are presented with numerous options as to the character you will play.  What attributes should your character have, what personality traits, what reputation, what should your character strive to be?  Will you take on different personas at work, in social situations, in simulated environments? The choice is up to you, but your choices are presented by advertisers who seek to steer you in a particular direction and supply you with the props to act out your character of choice.<br />Once you acquire the physical props needed to reinforce your character (which have limited revenue potential for the companies supplying them), you need to compliment your props with experiences.  Maybe you want to play a distinguished individual; one who lives in an exclusive golf community with others of similar status and means.  Your character of choice has the newest cars, the latest gadgets, and adheres to the norms of others playing similar roles.  <br />You own little if anything and consume most everything as a service - you lease your car, despite \\"owning your home\\" you have to pay for all kinds of memberships and fees to keep up the act.  You script your social circles and cultural experiences.  The majority of your relationships are based on monetary exchange and are pre planned.  You are able to purchase cultural experiences based on what market research has determined you want to experience.  You are presented with that which others have determined you want to see and will pay the most to experience.  Your experiences don't reflect reality, as it exists in nature, but the \\"reality\\" which you want to, and think, should exist.  <br />If you have enough financial resources you can rent the exact character you want to play, buy all the necessary props, and engage in all the appropriate cultural experiences.  Everyone will treat you just the way you want to be treated. You'll be able to script your whole life.  Will your relationships be built on trust, empathy, compassion and other genuine human emotions?  Does any of this matter?  Is there any difference between a life where everything is a paid for experience and one where it is not?  Is this much ado about nothing?  That's up to you to decide.  Jeremy vividly describes how such scenarios may affect you.<br />Another fundamental issue in \\"The Age of Access\\" is the private ownership and control of public assets and natural resources.  Should a private entity be allowed to claim exclusive ownership of the radio spectra over which all sorts of communications are broadcast?  Should a biotech company be able to patent (and therefore have exclusive use) of a particular gene that has always existed in nature but has only recently been discovered and put to a particular use?  Should companies be able to have patents on the very building blocks that make up life on Earth?  Should they be able to patent things that make up your body?  When it comes to property rights, where is the line between private property and the right of humanity to share in and access the natural wealth of the planet?<br />Monsanto, through the development of \\"Terminator seeds\\", has already shown how such patents and associated biological tampering may be used for the financial gain of a few to the detriment of the food supply of the world.  <br />[Terminator seeds were developed by Monsanto as a way to claim intellectual property rights and revenue from farmers.  The seeds are bio-engineered to be sterile so that instead of simply harvesting seeds at the end of one crop season to be used for the next, the farmer would have no choice but to ante up to Monsanto for seeds for next years crop.]<br />The parallel is made between cultural diversity and biodiversity.  As the world's natural resources are depleted, can we continue our current lifestyles, our massive energy consumption?  Many other works contend the answer is no.  Rifkin compares biodiversity to cultural diversity.  Can capital markets continue to operate if the very social fabric and trust on which they are built is transformed into continuum of paid for experiences?<br />\\"The Age of Access\\" is brilliant.  It raises issues that will become more and more important as we move forward into the age of \\"hyper-capitalism\\".  Will it matter if your life becomes a series of subscriptions and paid for experiences?  Should any private entity be able to claim control over things like genes or radio spectra or should they remain in the public domain for all to use?  Is it in anyone's interest for corporations like McDonalds's, Dunkin Doughnuts, Starbucks, and others to steamroll local cultures and business outside of the US in the pursuit of profit?  Rifkin presents scenarios that address these and many other questions.  You may or may not agree with issues and perspectives in the book but its one book you can't afford to pass up.	2002-09-02

Virtually no aspect of the economic equation factors in the true cost of anything - the toll it takes on the environment, the massive amount of energy consumed to maintain our lifestyle, or the biodiversity of the planet, which is continually diminished.<br />The Ecology of Commerce addresses these issues from both business and environmental points of view.  It recognizes there will be immediate, sometimes substantial, economic costs during the transition to a sustainable economy.  The point is made, however, that should the strain on the planets resources exceed carrying capacity, the consequences would be devastating.  <br />We don't, and probably can't know the precise limit till we get there.  At that point things are likely to get ugly.  Really ugly.  Paul correctly argues that we need to move toward a sustainable economy that more closely mirrors biological systems.  He suggests production processes that begin with the end of the useful life of a product in mind so that waste can easily and continually be recycled into new products.  <br />The book seems to be overly optimistic that business will see the light and move to adopt sustainable business practices.  While some are moving in this direction, they are not moving fast enough.  As the most powerful nation in the world and the one that uses far more resources than any other in the world, the US must lead the way.  Some companies are taking positive steps, but efforts need to increase dramatically.  <br />The Ecology of Commerce is a good start.  It lays out the direction in which we need to move.  The vision is an economy in which the full economic AND environmental costs are factored into the cost of goods and services.  This book lays out where we need to go; now we just need to figure out how to make a smooth transition to get there.	2002-08-23

In his traditional style of Texas wit and straight talk that originated in \\"There's Nothing In the Middle of the Road but Yellow Stripes and Dead Armadillos\\" Jim spins a comedic yet deadly serious tale of American politics gone awry.<br />If you find yourself voting for the lesser of two evils or the \\"noneoftheabove\\" category on Election Day (up to 60% of Americans), this book is for you.  <br />This is not a book about political parties or specific candidates, though you'll find snippets about selected familiar figures.  Instead, Jim chooses to examine the political process itself.  He examines the exorbitant return on investment expected from political campaign donations.  Both major parties in the US are hopelessly indebted to various interests no matter who the 20-25% or so \\"majority\\" of the population \\"elects\\".  In exchange for campaign contributions the lucky winners are doling out your tax dollars to those that put them in office.  A compelling argument is made for publicly funded campaigns.  That way the voters \\"own\\" the candidates.  Other issues of particular interest discussed in the book include:<br />Some rather gory provisions of NAFTA are described which have enabled, or may enable a number of hanus corporations to really screw things up in the pursuit of profit.  Among these are companies like Sun Belt Water who have plans, and make be able to turn Canada's water supply into a commodity the rest of the world may have to purchase.  Should Sun Belt or another company strike a deal for Canada's water, NAFTA has a provision that would require Canada to sell it's water supplies to any other foreign corporation looking to turn the worlds fresh water supply (of which Canada holds 20%) into a traded commodity.  Translation: if Sun Belt or another company strikes a deal to export water from Canada, Canada HAS to sell its water to other foreign based companies.  If that should come to pass, you may be buying your bathwater buy the bottle.  Remember those rolling blackouts in California?  Imagine if that was drinking water.<br />Other NAFTA provisions give foreign companies the right to sue other nations for simply making their own decisions as to what to purchase.  For example, in 1997 Canada banned MMT (a environmentally toxic and potential deadly gasoline additive).  Ethyl Corporation (the maker) sued Canada to the tune of 251 million for \\"expropriation\\" of its investor's profits.  This forced Canada to agree to settle for 12 million, apologize, and agree to lift the ban on MMT so that its citizens would once again be exposed to a deadly toxin.<br />Sweatshops are only found in 3rd world countries where companies tell the locals to Just Do It! - get to work in those apparel factories?  Surprise! Surprise!  We don't even have to leave the US to get dirt-cheap labor.  There is a little US territory called Saipan that serves the sweatshop needs of major US textile companies.  Those \\"made in the USA\\" clothing labels may have been sewn on by an indentured servant living in squalor earning a wage that makes the mainland minimum wage job look like a windfall.  A few shady loopholes make this possible.<br />Jim doesn't take political sides here.  He examines the process, the agreements, and worldwide (World Bank, NAFTA) organizations and agreements that are exerting increasing amounts of influence over world affairs and the state of the US. In addition to the issues mentioned above, there are some very inspirational (publicly funded) political figures and regular citizens taking action.  Their accomplishments are impressive, their determination unrelenting, and they are making a difference.  If you read only one political book, read this one.	2002-08-22

By now, its pretty clear the \\"$hrub\\" ain't the brightest guy in the world.  The press tells us every day and Bush firmly backs it up most every time he opens his mouth.  <br />Whoever runs against Bush in 2004 could use this book to script a bunch of mudslinging ads that make up the \\"substance\\" of most elections these days.  Over and over, this book tells us how stupid Bush is and how he favors the rich and lets people pollute.  If you want to read a Bush-bashing book, this will fit the bill.<br />Like the televised debates and most of the news media fodder on political issues these days, the intelligence of Bush is all but irrelevant (though the apparent lack of it doesn't help any) to the day to day or even long term strength and prosperity of the United States.  Just because other candidates are probably intellectually superior to Bush doesn't mean much when they are all owned by the same companies seeking tax breaks, licenses to run sweat shops, \\"self regulation\\", and the freedom to dump any and all pollutants in somebody else's backyard.<br />If you are interested in politics and the state of the US this is a book to consider reading, however, it exclusively airs the $hrub's dirty laundry and presents a very small part of the picture.<br />To see a much more complete picture, pick up:<br />\\"If The Gods Had Meant Us to Vote They Would Have Given Us Candidates\\" by Jim Hightower	2002-08-04

It appears there is some work around so it can work in this environment, but unless you want to go in and screw around with your OS it doesn't.<br />Second, even with XP PRO and IIS it seems that there are a good number of errors in the book or maybe there is some compatibility issue with XP PRO or the version of IIS that comes with XP.  <br />If you are new to UltraDev and looking for a book that guides you through the steps of building a dynamic site this would be a great book if the instructions worked more often.  As published, you'll learn some of the ins and out or UltraDev (which seems to be an awesome tool!) but most likely end up frustrated when things simply don't work.<br />The book gets a second star because there are some parts you can work through without having to chase your tail trying to figure out what mistake you may have made, when in fact, the error is in the book.	2002-06-12

Chris makes good points and hits home on the need to steer marketing in a direction that is better aligned with peoples' needs, helping them do what they want to do instead of bombarding them with junk.<br />It's rather philosophical, too much so for my taste. If you like that style of writing and have an interest in Locke's ideas, you may love this book.<br />Personally, I loved Cluetrain, and one day may pick up where I left off in Gonzo.   If you're thinkin' about buying Gonzo, go for it.  It's cool, it's different, got some great ideas, but just wasn't my style.	2002-06-12

Heck, you or someone you know probably has at least two of them!  Somebody must be getting rich off all this hard work, but it sure isn't you.  You'd think all that hard work would entitle one to \\"luxuries\\" like basic health care and education in the \\"wealthiest\\" country on Earth.<br />Michael Moore declares war on what he calls the \\"Stupid White Men\\" responsible for these and other inexplicable situations in the country that consumes far more of the worlds resources than any other nation.<br />He pulls no punches, and lays out a plethora of disturbing facts for your (dis?) pleasure.  The overall political message is that there is, essentially, no difference between the two political parties in the US.  One party tells you they are going to restrict your rights, destroy the environment, let heath care and educational systems fall apart, and then rigs the election, while the other does nearly the same without telling you they are going to do it.<br />Any publication of this sort will likely have a degree of exaggeration to it, but no more than the \\"spin\\" associated with the opposing side of the issue.  The difference here is that Michael Moore \\"spins\\" in plain English and calls it like he sees it with a degree of humor, depending on your perspective.<br />If you are a big Bush supporter, you will HATE this book.  If you are a hardcore democrat, your feelings may be similar.  If you are sick of the whole political process [and dismal health care, pathetic education systems, extravagant military spending or other issues] and need a kick in the pants to get up and do something about the current state of affairs (like vote!), this may be just the book for you!   <br />If you like this one, you might also like:<br />* Fast Food Nation<BR>* Nickel and Dimed<BR>* Cell Phones: Invisible Hazards...	2002-05-29

Eskimos have all the ice they need and presumably don't perceive the need to get any more, let alone buy it.  Joe Spoelestra illustrates how to take that ice and turn it into something desirable (a Slurpee) for example, or bundle it with something that makes it desirable - a sled and a lift to create an experience to sell.  <br />Joe details his experiences, primarily in sports marketing. They are especially applicable to those in the entertainment and service industries but can be applied in virtually any industry.  The book is full of new ideas, fresh insights, and ways to repackage that which nobody wants in such a way as to change the customers' perception of value and create a compelling value proposition.<br />The book is much better than this review. :-)  Pick it up, read it, enjoy it and act on it.  &quot;Ice to the Eskimos&quot; will give you fast easy ideas that can be used to jump start your business!	2002-04-22

Throughout the book he shares his thought, experiences, fears, and the unconditional support of his family throughout every twist and turn.<br />After years of success, a harried schedule of traveling to shoot on location, feeling invincible (living in the \\"bubble\\"), and burying the missing life essentials in a fair amount of alcohol, Michael describes waking up one day:<br />\\"I woke up to find the message in my left hand. It had me trembling. It wasn't a fax, telegram, memo, or the usual sort of missive bringing disturbing news. In fact, my hand held nothing at all. The trembling was the message.\\"<br />This he would later discover this was the first noticeable symptom of the onset of PD. When symptoms first show, up to 80% of the brain damage has been done. PD had been planning the announcement for years though the announcement was made to a deaf audience. It was some time before he was willing to listen and many years before the details of this conversation would be released to the public in such a way to bring about awareness, funding, and comfort for the Parkinson's community.<br />For years, Michael was able to keep the conversation confined to a very limited few, hidden from those he worked with, the paparazzi, and the fans who loved his work. Alcohol took care of some of the personal problems, while a good acting job and various PD medications took care of the outward symptoms.<br />Eventually he had the courage to deal with everything, kicked the drinking habit, went for counseling, and decided to have brain surgery to muffle the voice of Parkinsons. The surgery wasn't a cure by any means, merely a procedure designed to calm the tremors on the left side of the body. It was judged tobe a success.<br />Soon after the left side was quiet, the right side joined the conversation, serving to remind Michael that PD was there to stay. Despite his mastery of titrating and timing the dosages of his medication, PD continued to speak out at inopportune times and the decision was made to go public. <br />Since going public, Michael has raised awareness tremendously for Parkinsons funding and research, seems to be much more at peace with himself than at any time in the past, and considers himself to be one \\"Lucky Man\\" despite the early onset of PD.<br />\\"Lucky Man\\" is a spectacular book, along the lines of Lance Armstrong's \\"It's Not About the Bike\\". Pick up a copy, read it, enjoy it, and support Parkinsons research at the same time. Thanks for all the great performances Mike!	2002-04-22

Cell phones have become an integral part of American (and increasingly the world) society.  They are ubiquitous in the business world and day-to-day life activities. The authors discuss in detail the risks associated with cell phones, particularly those of the digital variety.  They tell the all to common tale of industry PR \\"spin\\" vs. public safety and common sense.  While it may not be correct to state that cell phones cause brain cancer, the preliminary indications and not heart warming. <br />Thus far clinical studies have shown:<br />1) Cell phone radiation penetrates deep into the developing brains of children.<br />2) Cell phone radiation results in chromosomal damage to blood exposed to wireless phone radio waves.  There is a link between chromosome damage and brain cancer.<br />3) Cell phone radiation breaks down the blood brain barrier.  Think of the blood brain barrier as an immune system for the brain.  As it breaks down, other environmental toxins more easily enter the brain and cause damage.<br />4) A number of studies showed a statistically significant correlation between brain cancer deaths and cell phone use.<br />5) Cell phone radiation can cause pacemakers to malfunction is they (pacemakers) are not properly insulated from cell phones that are within 6 inches of the pacemaker.<br />The above are based on elaborate human, animal, and laboratory experiments that examine the effects of cell phone radiation.  The experiments in the book focus primarily on cell phone use - when the phone is near the head.  If cell phone radiation is able to penetrate the human skull, the effects may be even more dramatic on soft tissue such as reproductive organs that may be continuously exposed to radiation by a phone carried in a pants pocket.<br />Based on the scientific evidence in the book you should avoid using a cell phone or being around one to be perfectly safe.  Since that is not likely, the following precautions can be taken:<br />1) Despite the aggressive marketing practices of the industry towards children, keep cell phones out of the hands of your kids, they are particularly susceptible to the radiation generated by cell phones.<br />2) Use a hands free model and keep the phone away from your body.<br />3) If you put the phone up to your ear, point the antenna away from you.<br />4) If you have one of those cool little phones with a built in antenna, the whole phone is an antenna and you are getting a heavier dose of radiation.  GET A HEADSET OR A DIFFERENT PHONE.<br />5) A cell phone has to pump out more radiation when the signal strength is low, try not to use the phone unless the signal strength is near 100%.<br />Initial studies show a clear link between cell phone radiation (especially associated with digital phones) and adverse health effects.  In the next 10 to 20 years the effects will become apparent with the general public serving as the test subjects.  Tread carefully on those wireless stocks over the long term, and take precautions today so you don't become a statistic.  Many thanks to Dr. Carlo and Martin Schram for timely well written book  packed with critical info for all wireless customers.	2002-04-21

Affluenza is just like it sounds, the sickness of having too much, or feeling like you have to have the latest and greatest of everything.  You experience a temporary high as you shop and buy, only to suffer the future consequences in the form of financial distress and increased clutter in your life shortly thereafter.<br />Combine a lack of financial education in schools and at home with relentless credit card company marketing, more and more advertising targeted at children, the public's desire to have the latest of everything (driven by relentless marketing on all fronts), and an epidemic results.<br />In Affluenza, the authors detail America's over consumption of everything, so much in fact, that if every country on earth (probably even just half of them) consumed as much per person as the US, the planet would simply be destroyed.  This consumption leads to debt and financial stress, environmental destruction, and a lifestyle that is simply not sustainable.  The financial, social, and environmental impacts are tremendous.<br />There is nothing revolutionary about anything in this book.  If you are like most people, you or someone you know suffers at least some of the symptoms, an addiction to shopping, difficulty paying bills (particularly credit card), and a deep down realization that all the stuff you have really doesn't mean much.  The book provides a new way to look at mass consumption and realize how it affects ones life.<br />The book describes the empty world of plenty many Americans live in, as well as the global consequences of unchecked consumption.  It also discusses various steps people have taken to simplify their lives (some rather extreme) and how the need to consume is in some ways simply built into the American society - like that 400+ a month most of us have to spend on a car to get back and forth to work so we have the cash to pay for the car.<br />Pick up a copy of the book and find a nice spot in the beautiful outdoors to go relax and enjoyit.  If this book is up your alley you may also be interested in \\"Credit Card Nation\\" and \\"Fast Food Nation\\".  Each covers a specific segment of Affluenza.	2002-04-08

For many people, the immense growth of global companies like Wal-Mart has meant extreme wealth, and/or cheap convenient shopping.  For many others, those that have to work there on a daily basis, the Wal-Marts of the world represent something completely different.  <br />It's living at or near the poverty level, being only one step away from the homeless shelter, not having access to adequate medical treatment, and not having the opportunity to learn new, marketable skills to advance beyond the current situation.<br />If you've ever worked at a fast food restaurant, Wal-Mart, or other near minimum wage job, you can identify with the folks Barbara encounters in \\"Nickel and Dimed\\".  <br />During her travels, Barbara works at a Wal-Mart, in a nursing home, and a restaurant among others.  As could be expected, the experiences are less than rewarding.  They are fraught with humiliation, grueling mindless work, and constant struggles just to maintain basic necessities such as a car (or even some kind of public transportation just to get back and forth to work), housing, and food.  Forget about health insurance, dining out, and many of the other \\"luxuries\\" many of us take for granted; its just not part of the picture.  <br />With all the \\"prosperity\\" in the US, one would expect situations such as there to be the exception rather than the rule.  Unfortunately its not, and the proportion of people that live this life is growing.<br />Must a profitable business come at the expense of sane, safe, rewarding working conditions where people treat each other like human beings?  Barbara's experience would seem to indicate that.  It's just not so.<br />No matter what your financial status, this is an eye-opening book, more so for some than others.  Awareness is a good first step to bringing about change but until public policy changes to encourage businesses to invest in people and pay living wages significant change will be an uphill battle.	2002-03-11

Fast Food Nation is a spectacular documentary on the fast food industry.  It covers the origins, major players, and details the evolution of the industry; it's health consequences, deadly practices, and the methods used to set your kids on the path to obesity and heart disease at an early age.  Despite the grim picture painted of the industry, Eric presents a fairly balanced picture that includes some positive steps taken by a number of small and large players in the industry to bring about change.<br />Around the time the major US auto manufacturers were dismantling public transportation systems so you'd have to buy their cars and busses and sit in gridlock all day, fast food establishments began to spring up in California.  At first they delivered food to cars in the parking lots, and later applied principles of scientific management (ala Fredrick Taylor) to speed up the delivery process, create uniformity, and take advantage of economies of scale.<br />Since then, fast food establishment have spread like mad cow disease, first in the US, and more recently around the globe.  In order to support and fuel this explosive growth, the industry has put a tremendous stress on the meatpacking industry and adopted brilliant, yet questionable marketing practices.<br />Fast Food Nation exposes the meatpacking industry in detail.  It exposes the industries' deplorable safety record, in terms of injuries including death and dismemberment of workers.  Not only does the exclusive focus on efficiency and profits come at the detriment of meat packing workers, but the health and safety of the general meat-consuming public.  Meat packing plants are routinely found to be in violation of basic heath standards and slapped with minimal penalties by the government, yet continue to operate.  This makes sickness and death a possibility (to the tune of hundreds of thousands of E-coli and Salmonella infections each year) every time you or I eat beef or chicken to.  Uneducated and immigrant workers within the US are literally sacrificing their bodies and sometimes their lives so that people can grab a burger on the go.<br />To keep the street happy and analyst ratings on the up tick, the industry as a whole must find ways to grow.  Within the US, fast food establishments as well as companies like Coke are becoming sponsors of cash starved schools.  Sponsorships may include signs and billboards, skewed \\"educational\\" videos, and of course, fast food stands with continued sponsorship contingent on sales quotas within the schools.  Is it any wonder America is becoming a nation of heart disease and gross obesity?<br />This review only skims the surface of the book.  You'll also learn about the manufactured tastes and smells associated with fast food (\\"natural\\" and \\"artificial\\" flavors), the stuff fed to the animals (FORTUNE did a feature article on zero waste farming several years ago, which detailed how livestock was fed its own excrement to achieve zero waste), and the inability of various government agencies to bring about change or even inform the public of contaminated meat recalls.<br />As long as the status quo is maintained and the profits keep rolling in, neither the government nor the fast food industry is likely to change its ways... According the information presented in the book, Conway's Red Top and In-N-Out in the Western US have created successful, sustainable fast food business models.  Even McDonald's has shown a willingness to change in response to significant pressure from the market.<br />Read this book, it is informative, well written, and just may change your life and eating habits for the better - but only if you act on the information presented.  Thanks for a great book, Eric!	2002-03-11

It's comical that someone could publish a book on &quot;The Power of Simplicity&quot;.  It's also says something about the corporate world - everything is always more complicated than it needs to be and things would run much more smoothly if people would keep things simple.

Despite this fact, the basics of a long-term search engine positioning, and online business strategy remain the same, and are amazingly simple.  <br />1) Identify the keywords and phrases that people use to search for that which your site offers.<br />2) Write the copy of your site such that is emphasizes the words and phrases used by your audience.<br />3) Keep in mind #2 and pay close attention to Title and Meta tags, incoming links (link popularity), link text, page headers, image names and alt text, and last but not least, the actual content on your site.  It's one thing to generate traffic, but quite another to convert that traffic into business!  - Pick up a copy of \\"Net Words\\" by Nick Usborne for more on content.<br />4) Ensure a search engine can index the critical pages of your site.<br />5) Submit where necessary and pay particular attention to directory submissions.  Once in place, they can be very difficult to change.  There is some good info on submitting to YAHOO!, but if you want to attain rankings in MSN (via LookSmart) this book does not provide the know-how for that.<br />\\"Search Engine Positioning\\" discusses each of these steps, some in more detail than others.  It provides engine-by-engine analysis (many of which no longer exist or have changed drastically - remember things change quickly here!) that details how each search site ranks sites and the interrelationships between indices that may be syndicated across multiple search sites.  This book will get you started in the arena of search engine optimization and highlight specific page elements that require special attention, how to select keywords, the difference between search engines and directories, as well as where to submit to show up in the search results for a particular engine.  <br />The book includes sites of interest including Search Engine Watch and those of various search engine submission and optimization services.  WebMasterWorld and SearchEngineForums, two of the best SEP resource sites were curiously omitted from the list.  They both pick up where this book leaves off, and provide forums where the most up-to-date industry information can often be found.  Any print publication will be somewhat outdated the moment it is publshed.<br />If you are new to the world of search engine positioning, pick up this book (It appears Fredrick is coming out with a new book - if so you might want to wait for it - the information should be much more up-to-date).  It is easily worth 35 bucks to have a single source of information to get started.  From there, take your learning online, experiment, use the many forums available, and don't get overwhelmed by the hype out there.  Positioning is a process, not a project, be persistent and you too can top the charts!	2002-01-30

The length that companies go to, to set-up bogus \\"independent\\" organizations to sway public opinion is simply mind-boggling.  PR agencies assume people are stupid and irrational; they then step in to skew the facts and help the ignorant make up their minds.<br />Numerous companies and recent events are profiled in the book to illustrate the harmful effects PR manipulation.  It calls into question so called experts and many &quot;independent&quot; organizations for a specific cause.  In most every case the long term health and well being of humanity takes a back seat to quarterly earnings.<br />Of the specific issues discussed, Monsanto's' pursuit of bio-engineered crops ought to be of great concern to anyone who eats.  While they play with the genetic traits of various crops in the name of making them better, the ultimate goal of Monsanto appears to become the Microsoft of food.  The goal is to stake claim to the intellectual property (genetic tampering) in the seeds used to grow crops - like corn, so that Monsanto can collect royalties for its' intellectual property.  In has also come up with a &quot;terminator&quot; seed that generates useless seeds for the following years' crop.  The farmer is then forced to ante up to Monsanto in order to plant a crop for the following year.  As one would expect, pollen from these \\"engineered\\" plants can mix with wild plants and cause problems.  While it may be impossible to prove beyond a doubt that such applications of genetic engineering will cause great harm, the company chooses to push ahead, gambling with nature and world food supply.<br />This is a book about education and advocacy.  The ultimate message is simply to stay informed, keep your ear to the ground, and know what is going on in the world around you.  This is a must read book for anyone outside the PR industry.	2001-10-21

You wonder, what the heck are they talking about and what should I do?  Get an agency that speaks English and read this book during the transition!<br />Laurie and Ken have compiled an impressive amount of quantitative and qualitative research on which to base &quot;The Soul of The New Consumer&quot;.  Far and away the most important statement to remember in this book is: <br />&quot;In effect, the Web site experience becomes the primary vehicle for building and reinforcing brand identity and preferences.&quot;<br />Information architecture (the structure of a web site), Internet marketing and Internet branding converge in the mind of the consumer.  They should be developed in tandem.  The web site experience IS the brand experience; think about it, think about your own web usage experiences.<br />&quot;The Soul Of The New Consumer&quot; goes on to discuss issues of great concern to many web users.  These include privacy, the (non?) existence of customer loyalty, traffic generation, conversion strategies, and perspectives of E-customers.  The quantitative research in the book can be found anywhere, the analysis makes the book valuable and the moderated discussions with consumers add a touch of real world insight that is missing from many books.<br />Now that you've read this book, and have a new agency that speaks English, you'll have a better idea of how to communicate with them.

A grand strategy is often created that is perfect and executed flawlessly - in the minds of those who create it - The details (tactics) will of course fall into place.  This, contend the authors, is how many a marketing campaign is carried out, often without the smashing success expected.<br />Bottom-Up Marketing is just that, developing a marketing strategy from the bottom up.  A successful strategy can be crafted only after the needs, wants, and minds of the consumers are understood.  Once the opportunity is identified, tactics are developed to satisfy the need, focus and refine the actions of the company.  Once a realistic picture emerges, a strategy can be created such that the entire organization can take the correct actions and take advantage of opportunities that actually exist.<br />Intelligence about the marketplace and opportunities presented within must come directly from the source, those on the front lines in touch with consumers.  Strategy and resource allocation comes from the top. <br />It's a good book with a clear simple message, combined with a dash of Trout and Ries' humor.	2001-10-15

Books	5	18	19	N	N	Assets, liabilities, and common sense	Mr. Kiyosaki has put together a no-nonsense guide to wealth accumulation.  There are no ten steps to massive wealth or futile predictions of stock market bust or boom (See &quot;Where are All The Customers Yachts?&quot;), just a strategy to go from being poor (a mindset) to realizing that while you may be financially broke you are only poor if you decide to be.  Along the way a fundamental financial principle is defined, that of assets and liabilities.  Simply understanding the difference (or not) can make or break you.  Assets increase in value over time while (to many) liabilities bleed you dry financially.<br />Beyond that, the emphasis of the book is on working to learn as opposed to working for money while letting your money work for you.  Granted, you and I and everyone else not the offspring of a millionaire will (out of necessity) spend lots of time working for a paycheck.  During those times it's not so much the money earned that is of importance but the experiences and insights into the way business operates, the way deals are made, and awareness of opportunities that open up every day.<br />In a nutshell Rich Dad Poor Dad suggests that the reader should:<br />1) Learn as much as possible and try to continually surround themselves with people smarter than they are.<br />2) Understand assets and liabilities; focus on building assets while minimizing liabilities.<br />3) Understand how money flows, particularly the tax implications of various investments and financial maneuvers.<br />4) Develop the resources and contacts necessary to take advantage of opportunities as they become available.<br />This book will not make you rich; it will make you think and open your eyes to strategies of the rich mindset.  Once you have the right mindset, the rest is up to you!	2001-10-15

The successful service provider communicates in crystal clear fashion the benefits of said services and charges based on the value delivered. (It's not what you pay; it's what you get!)<br />Perceived value is affected by numerous factors including environment and price. Can you increase the perceived value of your product or service by simply increasing the price? Beckwith discusses several cases in which this is clearly the case. Can a restaurant improve the taste of its' food by improving the decor? Arguably, yes.<br />When discussing State Farm, Beckwith states, \\"It is not slickness, polish, uniqueness, or cleverness that makes a brand a brand. It is truth.\\"<br />This strategy has worked well for State Farm. Due to the abundance of information available on the web this may become a required strategy for any company.	2001-10-14

It was written in 1940, but not much has changed.  The simple truth is no one can predict the future, not the weather (wo)man and not the financial community.  <br />In light of this simple truth, there is an awful lot of money flowing out of investors' pockets into (the pockets of) those paid to know the unknowable.  The cartoons and stories in the book make light of this and will cause most readers to chuckle. <br />Before buying financial advice (in the form of a broker, financial advisor, or mutual fund fees) understand just what it is you are paying for.	2001-10-14

Fundamentally, people don't change rapidly.  Wants and needs, both material and emotional remain much the same over time.  A rapidly changing workplace and technological innovation that result in tried and true human wants and desires manifesting themselves in different ways.  Much as air pumped into a tire simply forms the shape of the tire, needs and wants of people are conforming to technological and social change.<br />&quot;The Soul Of The New Consumer&quot; discusses this phenomena based on extensive and impressive research by the authors.  In the evolving marketplace, people seek timesavings, trust, and authenticity - things people have always sought but were previously more easily obtainable.  Could it be that as people strive to fill the relentless demands of these &quot;new&quot; consumers, they themselves become short-changed on time, trust and a feeling authenticity in what they do and who they are; then add to the cycle of depravation as they themselves begin evolve into the &quot;new&quot; consumer model?<br />As the marketplace evolves; businesses that speak honestly, listen intently, and save people time will flourish.  That, in essence is the focus of this book.  There is nothing new about this; it's going to take a while to figure out how to apply technology to reclaim what we had.	2001-10-14

Technology changes constantly; people, and the way the mind works remain pretty much the same.

As the amount of advertising explodes in every media outlet, (s)he without a positioning strategy is increasingly lost in the crowd.<br />Positioning is simply cutting through the immense amount of &quot;noise&quot; in the advertising and marketing world with a clear, concise, SIMPLE, message that occupies a place in the mind of the consumer. Positioning requires a focus; the brand, company or person who tries to stand for, and cover everything ends up representing nothing. <br />Examples abound in &quot;Positioning&quot; of companies that have utilized positioning to attain and maintain leadership and business success, as well as multimillion-dollar write-offs caused by brand dilution. <br />Within the book, you'll find chapters on choosing (brand) names, the decision to extend a brand or to not, repositioning other products to carve out your own niche, and how this applies to your company, its' products and even your career. <br />You can't afford not to buy this book!	2001-08-21

What new markets and synergies can we build through corporate diversification and brand extensions? This, Al Reis contends, is a loaded question, one that companies repeatedly answer and act on to the detriment of stock market success and earnings growth.<br />Reis argues that all to often the focus of a company is lost as acquisitions are made that have nothing to do with the core area of expertise. Strong brands are often diluted through ill-conceived extensions. The wrong extension serves to distract the company, and confuse the consumer as to what the brand stands for. V8 Splash anyone?<br />The loss of focus, and the accompanying deterioration of market share and competitiveness are illustrated though countless examples from virtually all industries. \\"Focus\\" is engaging to read, clearly illustrates the authors' arguments, and weaves just the right amount of humor throughout, to keep you smiling.<br />Focus is a simple but powerful concept. Not only does it make for spectacular business strategy, but investment choices, and the structure of your personal/professional life as well. If you ever feel like weight of your ambitions and varied endeavors is detracting from your achievements, a little focus must be in order. Read this book, you'll be glad you did!	2001-08-06

We (in the US especially) are used to thinking in terms of action-reaction, events, actions, and people, as individual and isolated.  We make distinctions and often-strict divisions between work and the rest of our lives. We  thrive on predictability, being able to determine outcomes, and control environments, which can inhibit the ability to quickly adapt to and accept change. <br />&quot;Rewiring the Corporate Brain&quot; recognizes this, and uses quantum theory to illustrate that we might be missing something.  The author demonstrates the shortcomings of the common, rigid Newtonian thinking and organization that permeates so many companies and minds, yet also recognizes that a pure quantum approach is not a cure all.  The author presents a hybrid model that recognizes the importance of managing and living to obtain certain objectives, while allowing and encouraging the creativity, exploration, and openness to continually grow and adapt to the torrid pace of change.   Not only does the application of quantum thinking make sense for the development and management of organizations, but also when trying to bring the separate parts of ones' life together into a more holistic, satisfying existence. <br />The book refers to a few related &quot;new science&quot; books, which may be of interest to the reader.  It also draws on some early Fast Company articles from the good ol' days before Fast Company became the useless waste of paper it is today.<br />This book is not technical or difficult to read.

He's got a family, lots of responsibilities, and recently lots of frustration.  At work, things aren't going as well as they have in the past, for our man Jim Manion.  Jim has a history of outstanding achievement at the company, however, his recent performance has attracted the attention of the CEO and other executives at the company.  <br />Jim needs to change, he needs to work better with the team, and regain is star performer status.  He's got two choices, stand his ground and assert that the problem is not with him, or dig deep within and make some changes.<br />He chooses the latter and confides in his friend Peter Miller.  Over the course of a few months Jim and Peter work together to get Jim back on track.  Throughout the turnaround time, the reader is exposed not only to Jim's trials and tribulations, but also to the thoughts and emotions of the executive team.  The book demonstrates how Jim's situation affects family friend, co-workers, and those wielding the power of the ax.

Goldratt, through his business novels, &quot;The Goal&quot;, &quot;It's Not Luck&quot;, &quot;Critical Chain&quot;, and &quot;Necessary But Not Sufficient&quot; laid a foundation which enables anyone to ease into an understanding of the Theory of Constraints (TOC) and the Thinking Processes (TP).<br />&quot;Thinking for a Change&quot; is one of a number of books which build on Dr. Goldratt's work.  The Thinking Processes are explained and illustrated in layman's terms.  The situations (dilemmas) used to illustrate Thinking Process applications include scenarios from both the business world and everyday family issues.  <br />Upon reading this book, you will gain an understanding of the following:<br />Current Reality Tree - Used to examine cause and effect relationships that bring about the present situation.<br />Prerequisite Tree - A road map of obstacles to overcome, and specifically how they will be overcome.<br />Transition Tree - Used to identify and understand specific objectives and actions that will lead to a change (Future Reality)<br />Future Reality Tree - A tool for visualizing and understanding the desired change and how specific actions will affect that future reality.<br />Evaporating Cloud - A simple tool used to identify and resolve conflicting assumptions.<br />If you are familiar with and believe in TOC methodologies, this book is a must have.

Developing and implementing a solid long-term financial plan for whatever your goals may be, requires an understanding of numerous financial, investment, and psychological principles.  The author does a good job covering the basics, and if you are looking for an introductory book, (which many people desperately need) this one is fair.<br />Ordinary People, Extraordinary WEATH can be summed with the following points:<br />1) Carry a mortgage on your house, even if you can afford to pay it off.<br />2) Don't diversify among different asset classes, the money you throw into a 401k<br />3) Invest whatever you can, lots of little investments add up to a lot.<br />4) Buy and Hold<br />5) Ignore the Dow, S&P, NASDAQ<br />6) You don't need to spend lots of time analyzing your money<br />7) Talk with, and educate the family about money.<br />8) Tune out the fodder the analysts are constantly spewing.<br />Generally speaking, good principles to follow.  If you want to read explanations for each of these, then read the book.  Half of the 300+ pages of this book is \\"In Their Own Words\\" consisting of clients reinforcing what the author talks about.  The cocky writing style the author utilizes gets annoying, as do the constant plugs to buy to more of the authors books. <br />Bottom line: Even though this feels like a sales brochure, it is better than many of those published during the net bubble (because its realistic).

A tipping point, as the author discusses it, is that at which something catches fire, a spark explodes into a forest fire, a protest turns into a riot. More recently, this phenomenon has come to be termed &quot;viral&quot; marketing in the world of the web. <br />The author presents numerous real world examples in which a tipping point has been reached. It is often small, seemingly insignificant actions, which are able to bring about dramatic change. Examples include social epidemics, as well as corporate growth success stories. Among them, the dramatic reduction of criminal activity in NYC, the rise of teenage smoking, the rapid rise and popularity of Airwalk (primarily skateboarding gear), Hush Puppy shoes, and even television programs like Sesame Street and Blues clues. Gladwell explores the actions, which cause something to tip, as well as the logic behind these actions. <br />This book is a masterpiece, those working in marketing may be particularly interested.  Viral marketing has become a popular buzzword for marketing consultants to drop far too often. This book will help you understand (probably more so than your marketing consultant) just what the possibilities of such a strategy are, and elements that must be in place for such a strategy to work. <br />&quot;The Tipping Point&quot; is complimented well Theory of Constraints (TOC) literature. (search Amazon for it) TOC provides rock solid logical tools for finding the one constraint which prevents growth of a system or organization.

Goldratt discusses this issue extensively in &quot;Necessary but Not Sufficient&quot; <br />BGSoft is a fictional ERP company that must face the reality of the aforementioned dilemma. BGSoft's clients desire a measurable ROI following the massive expenditure required for an ERP installation. This ERP vendor must dig deep to document the tangible bottom line (financial) benefits, which its clients reap from installation of the software. In his typical business novel format, Goldratt masterfully engages the reader, and eloquently presents the logic used to bring about bottom line results. <br />The results achieved are impressive, and involve the application of the Theory of Constraints. The company must carefully craft its moves so as to appease Wall Street.  Goldratt also delves into the reasoning behind the sometimes-astronomical valuations of technology companies, and the massive fluctuations associated with this speculative sector. <br />&quot;Necessary but Not Sufficient&quot; provides rock solid logic that is fundamental for success in today's technology focused business environment. While the focus here was an ERP vendor and it's clients, the same fundamentals apply equally well to the dot-com world. Look at the big picture, find the constraint, elevate it, and repeat. Most of all remember that people solve problems and bring about change and improvement. Technology is merely a tool, often necessary, but not sufficient in and of itself.	2001-01-10

Co-opetition debuted before the net arrived commercially, however it could easily have been written about today's hyper-speed corporate environment.  (Many companies in the Dot-bomb dead-pool may have benefited from this kind of rational strategic thinking.) As the title indicates, the book is about competition and cooperation in the marketplace.  Much of that discussed in the book stems from game theory, determining what moves to make in a game (or marketplace) based on the anticipated actions of the other players.  The book presents numerous case studies from a variety of businesses.  Each example provides a background of the competitive environment, the implications of different possible moves, and ultimately explains the results of each particular decision.  It's a fantastic book, and contains valuable lessons for decision-makers in virtually any capacity.  <br />Co-opetition is especially for those interested in game theory and business strategy.  It brings to light the fact that no decision is made in isolation, and demonstrates that a win at all costs mentality is often not the most successful plan of action.  Learn to analyze a situation, understand the scenarios that may result because of particular actions, move forward with a better understanding, and well thought out contingency plans for anticipated counter moves.	2000-11-04

Everything presented in this book will help those charged with the task of generating publicity.  Fundamentally, it must be remembered that publicity is just that, it is not paid advertising, it must be managed, but cannot be completely controlled.  The goal of the publicist is to provide relevant, newsworthy, information, which will be deemed to be of interest to a target audience.  Present the media with an honest, credible, story, that will help them accomplish their goals (attracting more viewers, selling more papers or magazines, or attracting more interested readers to a web site) and your story is more likely to be heard by those you desire to reach. <br />&quot;The Complete Guide to Publicity&quot; clearly defines publicity, what it is and is not, what to expect from a publicity effort, as well as the particulars to consider when dealing with various media and attempting to target specific audiences with your story.<br />An excellent introduction to the strategy and structure of a publicity campaign!	2000-11-04

If you are looking for something geared more towards the science, and psychology of color, then check out &quot;Color: The Secret Influence&quot;, which is a more scientific (yet very readable) book about color and light.

The publications and blather out there are endless!  The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Personal Power, First Things First (duh!) are great feel good books, but what does one really get out of them?  Well, after reading them, one supposedly knows what successful people do, what to do first, or maybe have an increased sense of personal power.  Somehow, I don't think so.<br />Enter Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and the idea of Flow.  Flow is about finding meaning in a particular activity, profession or if one is really fortunate in life.  The bottom line is that to achieve maximum happiness, enjoyment, or even &quot;success&quot; a person will often have &quot;flow&quot; experiences.  It's when worries slip away, when a person or a team is engaged in an activity, and is so focused that it seems effortless.  <br />Covey, Robbins, and the rest of em', will present you with a square peg which you may be able to smash into a round hole if you keep hitting it hard enough.  Understanding, yourself and what brings you satisfaction in life must come before following any prescribed method for improvement or success.  If you love what you do, and do what you love, you don't need some guru to give you the steps to success.<br />Flow can help you find and understand that.  You've got to start with the basics, and this book can provide insight on what flow is, what conditions facilitate it, how to achieve it, and where to start.  Highly recommended!	2000-11-04

Information spreads freely  and rapidly, whether we like it or not.  The time has come to embrace  rather than fight this phenomenon.  It is undoubtedly an uncomfortable  situation for many, used to having complete control over corporate  information through traditional one way marketing communication messages.   The Cluetrain, presents the idea that a marketplace is becoming a  conversation.  To stay alive and thrive in the new marketplace, companies  must actively engage customers in meaningful, honest conversation.   Employees must be empowered to participate in the new marketplace, to talk  to people frankly and honestly, to build relationships with real people.   <br />The rate of change is over estimated in the short term, and under  estimated in the long.  It'll be a while till we see if the Manifesto plays  out, and to what extent.  Companies will still utilize the traditional  carpet bombing methods of marketing, advertising, and public relations for  sometime to come.  Companies and the people behind them will eventually  realize snazzy new CRM software is simply for automation and not  relationship building.  Fundamentally, the web is a new medium to  communicate, for people to communicate, one to one.  Those that realize and  embrace this will reap the rewards of the &quot;new economy&quot;<br />The  Cluetrain is bold, it talks about massive change in the way business is  conducted, and puts forth numerous examples illustrating this change.  It's  a real book about real happeneings, authored by real people, not clueless  consultants selling their marketing verbiage.

It begins with an explanation of  strategic pricing, and proceeds to cover competition in the market place,  segmentation of buyers, pricing and the marketing mix for industrial and  consumer goods, as well as the psychology of pricing.  Also covered are  models for determining price sensitivity, implications of sales staff price  setting and negotiation, and finally, legal aspects of pricing.<br />After  reading this book, you will understand the pitfalls of pursuing market  share at all costs and common mistakes businesses and sales people make  when setting or negotiating price.  You will view your current pricing  structure and strategy in a new light, and be able to spot the weak spots.   You'll have a better picture of how to attract the right buyers, those that  can be served profitably.<br />The book indirectly touches on topics covered  in Co-opetition, and Thinking Strategically, as well as elements of the  Theory of Constraints (see Eli Goldratt's &quot;The Goal&quot; and  &quot;It's Not Luck&quot; or &quot;Management Dilemmas&quot; by Eli  Schragenheim)<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough.

Written in the form of a  Novel, it examines different value perceptions of the market.  You'll learn  about ultra variable costing, utilizing excess capacity to serve seemingly  unprofitable market segments, and how to break down barriers to achieve new  avenues to profitability.  Priceline is a perfect example of an entire  company built on exploiting constraints in the marketplace, and wringing  every last bit of revenue (maybe one day profitably) out of previously  unused capacity.<br />The book provides a brief introduction to the Thinking  Processes, which are used to examine conflicting logical arguments, and  develop a workable solution, satisfactory to both sides.  Within the book,  the methodology of the Thinking Processes is applied to both business  dilemmas, and to that of parent/teenager relationships.  It's all about  building understanding between people with differing perspectives, and the  variety of situations to which it is applied clearly illustrates the  versatility of Goldratt's methods.<br />If you found &quot;The Goal&quot;  valuable, you'll like this one, though w/o Jeff Cox, the writing isn't  quite as good as the Goal.  To continue your journey into the world of TOC  and the TP (Theory of Constraints and Thinking Processes) look for books by  H. William Dettmer.  No novel formats in Dettmer's books, that I've read,  but much more thorough explanation of TOC.  <br />For TOC on project  management, check out Goldratt's &quot;Critical Chain&quot;!	2000-08-19

All to often dreams and  their pursuit is repressed, as security and predictability are clung to.   <br />The Alchemist is an elegant tale of a boy who forgoes the safety and  security of remaining in the village in which he was born and raised.  With  the blessing of his parents, he decides to purchase a flock of sheep and  see the country.  Life as a shepherd is rewarding, for a time.  It's  predictable, and fulfilling, yet a recurring dream leads the boy to believe  there is more to life, than remaining a shepherd.  After consulting with a  gypsy and a king, the boy decides to sell his flock, and embark on a  journey to find treasure in the Egyptian pyramids (his dream).  The ensuing  journey forces the boy to dig deep within himself, to trust his intuition,  make the most of some less than ideal circumstances, and most of all the  believe in himself.  Numerous people, and encounters, including war, and  the woman of his dreams, build his character, and ability to trust his  intuition throughout the journey.  The treasure he reaps is the reward of  trusting himself, pursuing his dreams, and having no regrets throughout the  journey of life.<br />The Alchemist touches on issues faced by many people.   It is a story about following a dream, and living w/o regrets.  It's about  having the courage to step into uncharted territory, outside the safety of  the familiar, and embark on a rewarding journey.  If you are holding back  in life, feeling that you are capable of much more than your present  reality, pick up a copy of this book, and give it a few hours (which is all  it'll take you to read it).  It'll make you think, make you dream, and just  maybe give you the courage trust yourself, follow your intuition, and  realize those dreams you know you are capable of achieving.	2000-07-30

Markets and their inner workings are  defined, as well as the stocks, bonds, and other speculative investment  opportunities.  Several methods for timing the market, utilized at the time  of writing are explained and for the most part dismissed, which undoubtedly  have parallels in the modern financial world of today.<br />Forecasting of the  financial markets is discussed as well as the methods for increasing  leverage, primarily, trading on margin.  Strategies for minimizing risk,  hedging, shorting, as well as put and call options are examined and  discussed in detail.  Specific industrial sectors covered include railroad  (remember we're back in the 20's and 30's for this book) industrial stocks,  utilities, and mining operations.  An enlightening discussion of the  business and investment potential of oil and mining stocks is presented.   It serves to educate the reader on which links in the chain of exploration,  development, transportation, processing, and retail sale of these  industries are most suited for differing speculative risk tolerances.  As  we jump ahead 70 years to the markets of 2000, the reader can translate,  and apply these analysis to companies occupying comparable positions and  strategies in the Dot-Com world, and modern business in general.<br />If  you've got some time to kill, there is plenty of valuable information in  this book.  It took me a while to get through it, cause frankly it's just  not an exciting read.  It may very well put you to sleep.  If you are  simply looking for an intro to investing and getting finances under  control, one of the &quot;Dummy&quot; books will be a much better, more  practical book to read.  Buy this book if you are interested in an  historical perspective on speculative investing, which is in many ways  applicable to the financial markets of today.	2000-07-29

He examines the psychology and consequences of waiting, learning, and gathering information about potential investment and life choices.<br />An  informed decision would seem to be a sound one.  It may very well be, yet  in the context of the market, as information risk diminishes (more  knowledge is gained about a particular investment), the price risk will  increase (assuming positive news results in a rising stock price).  Once an  investment is deemed to be solid and secure, the existing information will  already be reflected in the price of the equity and the potential for  appreciation becomes much more limited (price risk increases).  The art of  balancing information risk and price risk is a central theme of the book,  which is discussed, in intricate detail.  Also discussed are methods of  determining when price risk is likely to be at an absolute minimum -- all  news surrounding a company is bad, and no matter how much more bad news  comes out the price does not decline further.  An interesting &quot;head  and shoulders&quot; method of timing the market is presented as  well.<br />Whether it's embarking on a new career, investing for a quick hit,  or retirement, taking a new job, signing an agreement or contract, making a  new purchase, or getting married, all of life's decisions involve the same  basic tradeoff between information risk and anticipated benefits (price  risk).  The author discusses not only the stock market and investing, but  presents mental models from various situations, which most anyone has  experienced, and can relate to in some form.<br />If you are interested in  learning about the psychology of the market, or simply exploring and  seeking to better understand your own decision making process better, buy  this book. It is truly a book about risk, and not one of the over-hyped  books blathering on about the stock market	2000-07-25

Margin requirements were minimal. Investment in equities, seemingly ANY equities was a risk-less, rock solid path to fortune. Why buy one of the new electronic phonographs, or a refrigerator,  on &quot;time&quot; (credit) when for the same amount of money, one could  buy equities on margin, gain immense leverage, and be  &quot;guaranteed&quot; to make the money back many times over, and be able  to buy many more luxuries. <br />According to Mr. Sobel, this was, in a  nutshell, the mentality of the average investor. Investment houses and  financial institutions fueled the fire by making margin cheap and easy.  Ultimately, stock prices were held up by nothing. Tremors of instability  began to ripple through the market as the impending crash approached, often  dismissed as buying opportunities. Ultimately, reality set in, and the  unthinkable happened. <br />Are things different today? Yes and No. More  safeguards would seem to be in place, however valuations of today make  those of the 20's look miniscule. While a direct comparison is difficult to  make between the period covered in the book, and the market of 2000, there  are lessons to be learned. &quot;The Great Bull Market&quot; provides a  fascinating account of the crash and the events that led up to it.

You feel like you are  reading about, and can identify with real people, as you progress through  the book.  The issues faced are common, and the thoughts, intuition, and  frustrations of the characters familiar.  All cases have constraints in  need of elevation, and subordination, which Eli illustrates through both  written TOC analysis, and through the use of traditional TOC constraint  busting diagrams.  <br />&quot;Management Dilemmas&quot;, falls smack in  between &quot;The Goal&quot;, and Dettmers' &quot;Goldratt's Theory of  Constraints.&quot;  It's more in depth than &quot;The Goal&quot;, but not  as intense as Dettmer's book.  If you are just getting your feet wet in TOC  this book will not be over your head.<br />An excellent addition to this book,  and all the TOC material out there would be case studies and applications  in Dot-Com world.  For much less than the cost of a Super Bowl ad (or the  120+ million it took Boo.com to go BOOHOO and belly up in 6 months),  companies could come up with a systematic approach to identify, elevate,  and exploit constraints, increase throughput, and have a chance of turning  a profit.	2000-05-19

We've all heard of Maslow or the hierarchy of needs in some form or other, but often times simply as a side note in some management or psychology class.  Here in one volume is the collection of Maslow's genius insights in  to human motivation.  The book is a collection of essays on motivation,  learning, management, and self-actualization (essentially, to be at piece  with oneself and become everything he/she is capable of becoming) Maslow  examines our organizational structures and how they greatly influence our  ability to achieve self-actualization.  He lays out a framework and  assumptions that must be made when dealing with people, managing people and  motivating them, and recognizes that there are different types of  personalities, beliefs, management styles, and management theories.  Theory  X (authoritarian, untrusting, management style) and Y (a belief that people  are trustworthy, responsible, seek meaning in their work, and naturally  want to learn) are explored in detail as are the effects of our belief in  one or the other.<br />While both theories and the implications of each are  discussed, it is clear that Maslow, as well as the contributors to the book  focus on, and believe that in general, Y is the dominant (most beneficial,  not necessarily the most practiced or popular) theory.  Theory Y cultivates  growth in personal meaning, satisfaction, and self-actualization, helps to  propel an organization to be the most it can be, through the collective  learning of the individuals that make it an organization.  Applying this  methodology in the right environment can contribute to the long term  success of an organization as judged both by the self actualization of it's  members, and the financial success of the organization.<br />Maslow scripted  and published his journal, close to forty years ago, however, it is at  least as applicable to the information based net economy of today, as it  was to the economy at the time it was published. While organizations and  economies change, people and psychology remain relatively constant. <br />Much  of it has been re-packaged and re-published by various management gurus of  today.  If you take an interest in people and management theory, order a  copy of this book.  There isn't a management book out there that contains a  magic formula for success, or applies to all organizations or even all  people in one organization.  This gem is a great start and will provide  insight in to people, management practices, and developing a mind set for  making a difference in the lives of the people in your organization, if you  want it to.	2000-04-29

Written in the style of a business novel, set in ancient times, when the Egyptian pyramids were being built, &quot;Selling the Wheel&quot; is a fantastic book, about the sales process.  It covers the different types of  sales people and personalities appropriate during various stages of the  evolution of a product, which in this case is the wheel. The book is also  about positioning a company, determining what markets to target, and  fending off competition. You will be introduced to the Closer, the Wizard,  the Relationship Builder, as well as the Captain and Crew, all of whom have  a place in the growth and evolution process of a business and it's sales  strategy.<br />Selling the Wheel&quot; is both educational and entertaining,  as are Jeff's other business novels.  It is creatively written, humorous at  times, and never dull.  It satirizes many of the situations and logic we  see in today's business environment including the world of the net economy.   Even in ancient times, star salespeople such as Ben (below) were way ahead  of the times:<br />&quot;But, Ben,&quot; said Max, &quot;if we sell them  wheels at twenty-four shekels, we're gonna lose money on every wheel we  sell!&quot;<br />&quot;I know, but we'll make it up on volume!&quot; Said Ben,  uttering a remark that would echo forward through the centuries.<br />Whether  you work in sales or not, this book is easy to identify with.  It touches  on elements presented in Jeff's other books (Zapp, Heroz, and The Goal),  including motivation, conflict, management, and day to day decision making  within a company.  If you have an interest in sales, or even in business,  pick up this book, set aside a few hours, and dive in!	2000-04-08
