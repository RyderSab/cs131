It was very good and I enjoyed this one more than the first one, even though it supposedly has less &quot;action&quot;.  The  ending is very good and you don't really want it to end. <br />Anyhow,  an excellent book and hopefully she writes another in this series.	1999-10-20

Unbeknownst to me, I was left with an entire server to configure, and I had no idea what I was doing.  I have spent the  last MONTH figuring out how to setup a pop3 server, DNS server, adding  users, and general system administration.  Yesterday, I purchased this book  for the full price, and now sincerely wish that I would have seen this gem  when I first started S.A.<BR><BR>  Configuring your own server is an unholy  pain, and now that I have this book, both my knowledge and expertise in the  wacky world of System Administration has reached a new plateau.  More than  likely within a few hours after this review has been written, someone will  come across it and ponder as to whether or not this is the book for them.  Whether you are a newbie or a seasoned pro, the money spent on this great  tome will be well worth it.  The chapters on DNS configuration WILL be worth  the price of the book alone!  Extra features include great tutorials on  shell, C, C++ programming.  Thanks Sams!!!	1999-10-17

The photos, especially, are not reproduced well with the chosen printing process, and the paper stock seems thin. This is surprising, considering that the sort  of person who would buy this collection most likely wouldn't mind paying  for a superior production. And given the price of the originals, there is  lots of room to manoeuver. Hopefully they'll reprint the variety of  ancilliary Exotique productions, such as the photo books, and upgrade the  physcial quality.	1999-09-08

Nothing significant even began to happen until there were about 100 pages left, and then it  happened too quickly to be convincing. Some of the characters were  underdeveloped or just plain unnecessary, as were some of the sub-plots.  Overall, this series is definitely worth reading, but I can't help thinking  that, after a LOOOOOONG wait for this final chapter, it fell short.	1999-07-13

It was quite difficult to read, not only because the author was extremely redundant, but also because the author did not explain things very clearly as he introduced the topics.  It was also difficult to read because it was so boring. The author does not  have a bit of humor.

It tells the life of a Danish resistance fighter, Jesper, and what he has to do during World War II.  The line that told me this was a good book was in the first  paragraph.  &quot;The Nazis are getting more desperate, as they get more  desperate they get meaner.&quot;  In the book, the main character, Jesper,  must choose between many choices all at one time.  He tells it first  person, trapped in a jail cell in Holland.  This wonderful book broke my  heart and made me happy many times over.  If this book sounds interesting,  read &quot;Lisa's War.&quot;  It tells the lead up story to &quot;Code Name  Kris.&quot;	1999-05-18

I always love to read about wars but once i finished this one it blew every book i ever read away.  The imagery in this book is amazing.  Erich Remarque went to painstaking detail to give us the  full picture whether it was from someone sleeping or someone's leg being  amputated and the feel of the pain. It really made you think about how  serious war's were and still are.  You always hear about it but it never  really crosses your mind the mental pain alone they have to go through let  alone the physical.  Erich Remarque described how they missed their  families and how they yearned for love but what they wanted was no where to  be found.  Paul and his friends were so happy and felt lucky to have two  cigarettes in their hand.  That just goes to show you how horrible the  conditons were during the war.  This is a great book to read even if you're  not into war books.  Just give it a try.	1999-05-18

The story begins when Dr. Susan invites Dr. Donald Richards, a psychiatrist and author of the book  Vanishing Women, a book that tells real life disapperences of women, to be  a guest speaker on her show to talk about his book.  Susan is most  interested in one story that he had not covered in his book, the  disapperence of Regina Clausen, who disappeared 3 years before while taking  a cruise.  Their only clue:  a turquoise ring with the inscription  &quot;you belong to me,&quot; which was found in Regina's room on the ship.   Susan discusses this case on the air and asks her listeners to call in if  they know anything.  If only she knew who her show was being heard by.  In  the events that follow, Susan ends up being very involved with in the  unclosed case with the new discoveries of the missing woman, but doesn't  realize until it is to late that she is blindly leading herself and others  into danger of Regina's kidnapper who just happens to be still  around.....and he isn't about to let anyone come close to solving this  case.  And those with evidence who try to won't live to tell about it.  A  fast paced, well written story that will leave you guessing throughout the  book.  And just when you think you've solved the mystery, think again.   With lots of characters, this story will leave you guessing WHODONEIT until  the end.  A book that you won't be able to put down until you know what the  title of the book really means to the story.	1999-05-18

This book contains excellent descriptions that give you the true feeling of what the stroy wants to get  across.  The stunning descriptions make the whole world of Earthsea seem  real and very enchanting.  The book also gives you a sense that it could be  real because of all of the little restrictions that people and wizards  have.  You might think that a wizard could not be stopped, but this book  gives lots of things that wizards must obey to keep the balance.  This book  also shows distinct character development of the main character.  The book  shows how he gradually faces his fears and overcomes it.  Also, there is a  late climax that keeps you interested until the very end of the book.  The  world of Earthsea seems real for the fact of the people in the book.  The  people are not all nice and willing to help the wizard.  Most of them give  him the cold shoulder, and yell a spiteful curse at him.  At points in the  book I feel sorry for the wizard because it seemed like he had no friends.   As the stroy comes to a close, it makes you think about how power c an be  abused.  It also makes you think of the consequences of your actions.  You  never know when you might release an evil.	1999-05-18

I read &quot;Silent Night&quot; and I didn't like it very much.  I didn't think it was very mysterious because it is so easy to figure out who the killer is a couple of chapters into the book.  There were a couple of  moments where you were wondering what was going to happen but most of the  book wasn't thrilling at all.  I kind of liked Reva's character a little  bit, though.  I thought that she actually had a reason for being such a  jealous, stuck-up, spoiled brat.  If you read this  book you will be surprised at some things at the end but you'll probably be  able to figure out who the killer is before you're supposed to.	1999-05-18

Evlen Star was a great mix of suspense, action, and love.  Even better than the first of the Death Gate Cycle.  It was a story of segregated races coming together to save themselves from annihilation.  The only small  problem with Elven Star was the little relation to Dragon Wing(also an  excellent book).  The only relation was that of Haplo and his dog traveling  to a different world.  All of the other characters are new.  Though they  were new, the characters were well-created.  Zifnab added a few laughs to a  long journey, though sometimes his ramblings were not even close to funny.   Another great part of the book was the constant action.  There were no  boring stretches of the book that were just too boring to read.  There was  always something happening.  I always wanted to keep reading, wanting to  know what would happen next.  Unless the answers of Dragon Wing are  answered in later wolumes, Elven Star could have been made complete with  more information on the world of Arianus.  After reading Dragon Wing I  decided that I would try the next book in the series.  After reading Elven  Star I know I am going to read all seven books.	1999-05-18
