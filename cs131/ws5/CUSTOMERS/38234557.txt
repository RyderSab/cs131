So the first book of the WW2 trilogy begins in Philidelphia with Flora Blackford having been woken up early in the morning of 06/22/41 by Jake Fatherston's bomber squadrons paying the defacto capital the first of many unwelcome visits. <br /> <br />It ends with Flora being woken up barely a year later after enduring yet another bombing raid by our Confederate friends, being summons to congress and told that President Al Smith is dead after well placed CS Airforce bombs had taken out Powel House. <br /> <br />In between, the lives of our srinking Great War cast play out their respective soap operas... <br /> <br />Jake Fatherston is revelling in the glory of revenge against the USA by cutting that country in half with a spectacular Barrel push through Ohio and up to Lake Eire.  Setting up and succeeding in making Utah a rebellious state again.  And the beginning of the end of the Negro problem with death camps. <br /> <br />Caught up in the whirlwind of this new war are Clarence Potter, the cunning CSA intellegence general, Tom Colleton a sucessful colonel, now alone without his annoyingly selfish sister, Anne, who was taken out by a well placed USAAF fighter bomber's ordanince. Jefferson Pinkard, the prison manager, faced with the growing problem of mass slaughter at his camp invents through fate a more \\"humane\\" way of dealing with the negro problem. Hipolito Rodruegez has a near miss with electricity in what will soon become a less boring life as he has been sent as a guard to a new super camp that will be eventually run by his old WW1 buddy, Jeff.  Scipio continues his depressing life of a black man in the CSA, whatching all around him as the world falls apart.  I'm amazed that he has lived this long. <br /> <br />Up North, life is no better.  Jonathan Moss returns to the air a widower and seeks revenge on the CSA with his flying skills but in this first book he eventually gets shot down...on the wrong side of the line.  All three top brasses in the US Army are left in limbow with failed counter attacks and a rebellious Utah to deal with. No doubt more from messers Dowling, Morell and MacAurther in the next book.  Mary Pomeroy starts her one woman war against the USA.  Mort, her husband, figures this out and tells her to be carefull.  Leonard O'Doull continues with the Quebec storyline has a MASH doctor in the front line.   <br /> <br />At sea, USA and Japan are at it again.  George Enos Jr eventually ends up in the Navy and with his famous name, fits in nicely with navy life.  However Sam Carsten and his beloved USS Rememberance part company when the US Navy lose the battle of Midway and the ship is sent to the bottom while Sam finally becomes a full LT.  Watch this space... <br /> <br />Back on land Al Smith is trying to hold his country together and with the help of FD Roosevelt, fends off questions by Flora Blackford reguarding large amounts of money being spent on a super secret project way up in Washington state.  As news of atrocities leak back to her of the plight of CSA negros, she soon discovers that her own country dosen't care much for them either.  All this dosen't matter for Cincinattus Driver who is now stuck in CSA Kentucky and has the misfortune of running into Luther Bliss and his saboutage operations.  Still Driver is one of the most cunning characters in the whole series and Bliss may not know what's installed for him... <br /> <br />Overall a big book that I found somewhat empty in plot, but it is just the beginning.  I would have liked to see some new faces for a new war and I do miss the humour of a Gordon MacSweeny character.  The Atomic Bomb is obviously on it's way.  The USA is developing it, and know doubt Jake Featherston will rethink his attitude towards the scientists he turned away with the same idea.  As for his Negro Pogrom, the horror is just starting to unfold... <br /> <br />Four Stars, but only just!	2004-12-01

Mainly a book of pictures.<br /><br />Knowing the personal opinions that this author puts into his narrations, I wasn't expecting alot of indepth research. Starting with the DC-8, we are taken through the fleet and it's many forms.  On to the DC-9 family and then to the DC-10.<br /><br />As expected, the author keeps the narrative of this (DC-10) airlner's early history quiet by simply not writing about it.  Instead he focuses on the positives and the fact that the DC-10 did enjoy a good reputation among pilots, cabin crew and passengers alike.<br /><br />Next up the post McDonnell-Douglas merge airliners starting with the continuing improvments of the DC-9, the MD-80 and MD-90 family.<br />Like the B737 they were the next generation and before the Boeing takeover the ultra efficient MD-90 was going to be the new generation to go head to head with the B737,700-900 family.<br />The shorter '95 was allowed to live on as the new B717 untill the global climate brought production to an end in 2007.<br /><br />The last entry is the failed MD-11 trijet.<br /><br />The long overdue stretch of the DC-10 arrived in the early 1990s however it failed to live up to expectations at first and by the time improvments were made, potential airline customers had walked away.<br />All was not lost as the MD-11 has proven to be an excellent freighter, Boeing promoted it as the B11F but the lack of orders no longer warranted a production line and it closed in 1998. The MD-11 will live on in both roles as Boeing will continue to support the type even though they now no longer build it.<br /><br />An overview of this book reveals a good batch of pictures and a few rare gems, such as the Rich International DC-8s at the end of that company's exsistance. But as usuall the author's imput leaves you alittle depressed with his constant reminding of fallen airlines.<br /><br />Mainly good for pictures.	2004-04-22

The final episode in the American Empire series shifts into a higher gear as we build up to the second world war. Considering the slow pace the previous two books (Blood And Iron, and The Center Cannot Hold)had, I was quite satisfied with the more energetic pace of Victorious Opposition.<br />As expected, the whole storyline revolves around the imbittered receintly sworn in president of the CSA, Jake Featherston. Taking charge of the impoverished and demoralised country, he soon starts out on a programme of recovery which includes rearming the \\"Confederate Citrus Company\\" airplane fleet, a massive tractor building programme (so gaining practise mass producing tanks), conscripting a massive White only labor work force whilst taking revenge on all those who wronged him and the CSA. Taking back what is rightfully CSA property is also a priority and Kentucky is the first to return to CSA.  <br />Basically following the lines of reality 1930's Germany, we follow the fortunes of those supporters of the Freedom Party. <br /> Party stalwart Jefferson Pinkard ends up running a prison camp for political prisoners but soon realises that he has to take on a more challenging task, dealing with the growing numbers of Black prisoners that are arriving in their thousands as Featherston takes his revenge on them. You can see where this storyline is going...<br />Hipolito Rodriguez starts to enjoy the status of Freedom membership and his family are all going through the motions of Youth Squads and the benefits of belonging, however I can see a little doubt in his mind beginning to grow...watch this space.<br />Those who have stood against Featherston are also having to come to terms with the new order. Clarence Potter suddenly finds himself a Colonel in his old capacity of intellegence gathering after an unlikely situation that saw him attempting to take Featherston's life but saving it instead.<br />Anne Collerton gets her just desserts when she rejoins the Freedom Party, Featherston sends her off to France as unofficial ambassidor and keeps her well down the ranks and in her place. <br />Vice President Willy Knight attepts a Coup on his leader and fails dramatically.  He finds himself in Pinkard's prison.<br />However the best moment of Featherston's revenge spree has to be the final run in with his ultimate advesary and long time reason for his bitterness, Jeb Stuart Jnr. This is one of the best highlights and reading through the sub chapter a couple of times is quite enjoyable.<br />The plight of the Black man in the CSA is taken up by the weary and lonely Scipio and his family. Reading his plight through this episode, one does have to remind oneself that this is the work of fiction.<br />In the United States and Canada, we see the end of three big characters that have been part of the scene since the beginning of WW1 (with one starting off in How Few Remain). Nellie Jacobs dies suddenly after cutting herself and getting blood poisoning as a result. She goes still hating men but tries to confess to her family about Bill Reach in her last gasps.  She fails.<br />Sylvia Enos was the supprise death, having been accidentally shot dead by her drunk lover, Ernie who is still a fustrated man, having been injured in a very manly place while being an ambulance driver in Quebec in WW1.  He was, of course, rescued by none other than Lucien Gaultier...<br />The swaggering Quebecouis finishes his life 'on top' however I have always found him rather a boring character. No great loss.<br />These three characters have their offspring to continue the storyline.<br />Cincinattis Driver continues to risk life to better his family's situation.  His foolish return to Kentucky sees him finish this book stranded in the now CSA state.<br />The Military men find themselves having to catch up with the world with Abner Dowling, Irving Morrell, Sam Castern and Jonnathan Moss gearing up for the darkening clouds of wars.  Moss more so for revenge as his famous wife andbaby are killed by a bomb mailed to the by none other than Mary Pomeroy.<br />Chester Martin starts off the Union movement in California after suffering the conditions of workplace harrasment by the bosses of the huge housing project he is working in.<br />Flora Blackford is re-elected to congress but she is to little to late as Jake Featherston finally calls on the USA to hand back everything they took from the CSA in WW1.  As the world starts falling apart in Europe the enevitable happens.  On the morning of June 22 1941, Jake Featherston finally takes revenge on the USA...<br />All in all a much better conclusion to what was a long drawn out trilogy.  The main space to watch in the upcoming WW2 series is what will Japan do.<br />As I have already asked in previous reviews of Harry Turtledove, a bridging Novel between How Few Remain and American front would really complete this running series of alternate North American history, prehaps this year, in the meantime lets \\"settle accounts\\"- roll on April 2004!!!	2004-01-07

Churchman and Tony Hurst have teamed up to update a book that was first produced in 1990. A nice big book full of color and easy to read articals will appeal to young and old alike.<br />New materal has been added to allow the passage of time,(the continued demise of the network including the now truncated Otago Central Line) however the format is still the same with a few added extras.<br />Like the United States, New Zealand's rail system was created from the need to open up communications between communities during early settlement. The first operating public railway opened in the South Island in 1863. Originally the Provincial Governments were to provide for their own systems and at one stage New Zealand had three gauges operating. Standardisation came at the start of the 1870s with Central Government stepping in and ordering all railways to operate on the 3ft 6in gauge (instead of 4ft 8in) to allow for easy construction. Today that decision has been seen as a mistake. <br />An oddity was the privately funded and run Wellington and Manawatu Railway, which was allowed to be built to aid the government during the 1880s depression. A success, the fully American like railway ran until 1908 when the Main Trunk Line was completed and the Government execised it's right to absorb the line into the Government Railways.<br />By the mid 1870's the South Island had a main line extending from Christchurch south to Invercargill with numerous branch lines sprouting out from it. <br />The difficult terrain of the North Island saw the capital of Wellington finally connect with Auckland in 1908. Although a British colony, as already metioned, New Zealand adopted American practise in locomotive building (even today) while operating practise maintained some British systems such as signalling while level crossing warning systems were and are very American. <br />However it was only in the 1940s that the country had a full trunk network with the completion of the difficult to build North Line in the South Island between Picton and Christchurch. <br />Eventually the spider's web of railways crossed the girth of both islands and this book depics the trials and tribulations of those who built the network,(private consortiums and Government)those who ran it and to many the sad demise of the many secondary and branch lines, including the now famous Fell Railway in the Wellington region. All this was possible as ther were road restrictions placed on the movement of goods, which is explained in detail.<br />Well written, it is easy to follow and every branch line that the New Zealand Railways owned and/or operated gets a mention.  Included are some of it's idiosyncracies,(Passenger carrages on the famous Tranz Alpine Express are over 50 years in age)  and it's eventual failed privatisation in 1993.  <br />Now that the rail system is about to be partially re-nationalised after constant failiure to turn a good profit (even though it moves more freight now than it ever did in Government ownership) it now seems that a new chapter in New Zealand's rail history is now beginning. The lesson to be learned, a small population cannot sustain a private railway that has to compete with raod transport.<br />For those who barely know of New Zealand's rail heritage, this book is a great introduction.	2003-11-23

The Tenth Anniversary slab of this irrepressible duo gives us an overview, by Bill Watterson, of the strip's history.<br />The very best of all his Newspaper strips are explained in fine detail.  Of course the cartoons speak for themselves but it is amazing how far the quality of Calvin And Hobbes has developed.  The early drawings look rather crude, but then so did the &quot;Simpsons&quot; when they first started.<br />Highlights include Calvin v Rosslyn (Stupendous man), Susie finding Hobbes, Calvin and Susie and a rare sighting of Calvin's Uncle as a storyline character.  The Duo verses Mom and Dad strips are always great.<br />Of course Calvin And Hobbes' interaction with each other in Calvin's make believe world also shows up a rather sadder side of this little child's life, - he is a highly intelligent individual, self opininated, difficult to befriend, a total loner and an outcast.	2003-11-21

The oil shock of the 1970's and it's effects on the small island nation of New Zealand is the base for the storyline of this novel. <br />The story follows a man, Smith, who has just seperated from his wife and wants to get away from reality to recuperate, so he sets himself up in the Coromadel district but soon finds out that he is in the wrong place at the wrong time...<br />New Zealand has just declared martial law as the totalitarian government tightens it's grip on the ailing country and attempts to squash opposition to it by declaring all those against it are Communist insergents and in no time the United States sends troops into the country to &quot;guide and assist&quot; in anyway they can.<br />Smith is captured by the Special Police but soon escapes and is drawn into the conflict that is tearing apart the country.  In a twist of irony, Smith is set up by his ex wife's lover, who is leader of a major guerrilla cell,  and his actions soon make him number one on the Governments hit list.  By now New Zealand is in total war.  <br />There are two novels printed, the original and the post film (Sleeping Dogs, starring a very young Sam Neil) edition so watch out for the two different conclusions.<br />The reality is that in the late seventies and early eighties, New Zealand really did have a well spoken and overpowered right wing dictitorial leader, Robert Muldoon.  When the South African rugby team visited the country in 1981,  the writings of C.K. Stead's Smiths Dream had a chilling truth of sorts about them.	2003-09-22

All the while a crunching sound is resonating through the stale air they are breathing...The Langoliers, the evil cousins of Pac Man are eating the used up time and space and are closing in on them.  All the while psycotic passenger is casing them grief.  There is always one.<br />The Aeroplane and it's passengers make a hair raising escape and attempt to return to normal time,  but there is a catch, they must find the rip in space and to pass through they must all be asleep...How will they do it? Someone will have to make the ultimate sacrifice.  The ending has a little humor in it, a passenger who had to much to drink at the airport lounge before boarding finally wakes up none the wiser as the intrepid voyagers arrive at their intended destination, albeit a little early for time, safe and well.<br />This story was made into a B Grade TV movie in 1995 with surprisingly good results although given the budget of a blockbuster, would've been a real thriller.	2003-09-20

What alot of people don't realise is that the first television broadcast of this event was the infamous 1936 Berlin Games albeit via a closed circut network within the surrounding areas of the venues. The 1936 games were also the where the first lighting of the Olympic Flame began.<br />This is where Nigel Blundell picks up with the torch with a quick history of the games (politics, tragedy, drugs etc...)and a very comprehensve history of the results, medals etc with an overview of the stars of the games.<br />This book was printed before the XXVII Olympiad, 2000 Sydney Games but as it was intended as a complement to them, the venues and Sydney it'self are included in this large and rather heavy to hold and well illistrated book.	2003-09-10

The central subject being the Douglas DC10 and the two major disasters that nearly ended it's career as a passenger liner, first the American Airlines O'Hare disaster, which of course was the result of negligence on the part of maintainance lazyness.  I wonder if those who changed the engines that way before that tragic day can live with themselves today.<br />The second DC10 incident is the tragic Air New Zealand Antarctic sightseeing flight.  Human error and the events leading up to the aircraft's demise are explained in great detail but there are still to many unanswered questions.<br />Another incident tells of the epic and heroic actions by the pilots of the now famous Japan Airlines 747SR flight that became the worlds worst single airliner disaster.<br />To ease the tension the author has included the British Airways flight that flew through a volcanic cloud over Java in 1983, the one flight that got away with it.<BR> <BR>Once again Macarther Job has done well on a subject that is still very much taboo for many people.	2003-05-31

Many blame high command for the famous scatter order, but as we know the message was misread and the results are tragic.  All the while the nation receiving this aid, the USSR, did nothing to help or assist in any way what so ever.  In my opinion a very selfish and ungrateful act.<br />Photos are provided and are well discribed.	2003-05-31

Pilot error is also included as human factors in this then new tecnology also played it's part. <br />This would be in evidence when the greatest disaster of all is covered by Job, the KLM/Pan Am disaster in Teneriff.<br />The Douglas DC10 makes it's appearance and through Job explains that it is not the aircraft's fault for it's failings but man's failing to understand the technology that has been provided at the time.

We all like to glamorise the Airforces of the world with their high technology driven fighters and the glory days of old. But we seldom spare a though for the now major element in every airforce's inventory - airlift transport.<br />We move through to the present day and the future with even bigger aircraft on the drawing boards. It's hard to see nowdays life without these heavy transports to move entire divisions and their equipment around the world to be ready for action within hours, let alone relief aid. <br />Richard Townshend Bickers takes us through the history of military air transport that has always been around since guns were placed on airframes a little under 100 years ago.<br />Illustrated with lots of pictures from all side during the major conflicts we get to see some familliar aircraft in military guise as well as some rare gems such as the Budd Conestoga and the high winged Douglas DC5, both aircraft a much superior design than the ubiquitous Douglas DC3/C47. The fact that mass production was the only reason that the C47 succeeded is proof of this.<br />The only bug in this book is a better history of the Russian heavylifters and the written storyline dosen't follow the picture format to well. Still a great book for those with an interest mainly the younger variety.	2003-05-31

The British experience reads of arrogance and even when the great Dr Hugo Eckner offered his assistance, they turned him down.  The United States pushed the envelope too far and even though they had the most modern Airships to date, sadly they too would be put off developing a transport network.<br />In the end it would be Germany with it's conservatisim and experience that would see out the great Airship era with the globetrotting LZ127 Graf Zeppelin and LZ129 Hindenburg, it's life cut short by that tragic day in 1937. If helium had been used, flights would have continued with the last Airship, the new Graf Zepplin LZ130 and it was used for recon flights just before war was going to break out. When the end came, it was swift and sudden and the great Airship era was over.	2003-05-31

The famous 1988 rogue challenge by New Zealand businessman, Michael Fay and his massive white monoloth, KZ1.  Dennis Connor rose to the challenge with his famous hi-tech multihull, Stars And Stripes and the lawyers took over from there.  <br />The 1992 event was the most lavish ever has money ruled the waves and the more boats one had the better chances of winning would be.  <br />Eventually comonsense prevailed and the two boat rule introduced, and we are left with the event we have today.	2003-05-31

Clarke direction and leaves you quite chilled at the story's end.<br />The basic story is of a handfull of scientists in the not too distant future, who quite accidently stumble across a way of disabling the entire World's stock of fire arms.  Using electrons to ignite gunpowder.  Soon the discovery reaches the White House and the chance to disarm the world of weapons is undertaken...<br />If it was only that simple and in doing so the Trigger causes more distruction.  However the same scientists later find a way around this and soon the Trigger, in a more safer form is released onto the mass market. <br />Soon the the enevidable uprising of those who think it is their right to bare arms (as it does say in the Constitution) takes over the storyline.  A high paced conclusion is in order and that totally Aurthur C. Clarke twisted ending that he is famous for leaves you hanging and thinking, \\"Maybe having the world armed with primitive guns is not such a bad idea after all.\\"<br />sheesh!	2003-05-15

This allowed Hitler to carry on the fight to defeat Russia.<br />The world turned topsey turvey with the election of hardline isolationist Charles Lindburg as president of the USA and a puppet King Edward VIII on the throne.<br />By the 1960s, Germany was at a peace of sorts (still fighting Russian resistance in the east) and willing to talk on freindly terms with their Cold War foes, the United States of America and it's hardline president, Joeseph P Kennedy.<br />Germany needs America's hand as they both share a hate for communisim and the russians still can't be defeated.<br />The story begins with a mysterious murder of a high ranking Nazi Party official and the case is picked up by a reciently divorced SS investigator.<br />A delegation of American press reporters have arrived in Berlin to cover the visit of President Kennedy and the 75th birthday celebrations of the ageing Adolf Hitler.  It is then a report receives information about an event that happened during the war.<br />Eventually both reporter and SS inestigator meet and soon they are on the case which becomes more dangerous as they dig deeper and then uncover the horror of what happened during those dark years,  all the while the Gestapo is closing in on the pair of them to keep this dark secret safe from the man who could eventually bring down the thirty year old Reich, President Kennedy.<br />Ending on a high, this book is a good read on alternate history.

And it only takes a freely avaiable to the public virus, an averagly intellegent person with a grudge and a well thought out plan to do it.<br />The start begins with a young school girl who suddenly takes ill and in a short time dies in a rather violently spectacular fashion. Accross town a homeless man also dies in the same spectacular fashion. <BR>A quick jump back in time shows a past that America has every right to be ashamed of - the testing of biological weapons that are so deadly even Richard Nixon himself band their use.  Naturally the Russians who have a &quot;fishing trawler&quot; working near the test site obtains a sample of what will eventually become the most potant and deadly virus ever made.<br />It soon ends up in Iraq and Saddam's hands...<br />However the Centre of Disease Control sends one of it's investigators to see if there is a connection to these horrible deaths.

Katarina is soon on it and starts to leave a trail of blood which is picked up by an English professor who has a wife in one of the Poland death camps, and will do anything to get her back.  His Government soon gives him the job of chasing this woman in exchange for the freedom of his wife.<br />A very good storyline involving the Atomic bomb project and the race between Germany and the USA to see who will win.<br />It also plays on the fact that the Allies and Axis still had communication with each other underground while the fighting continued above.<br />Although a great spy capiable of taking on James Bond, Katarina isn't successful in delivering her orders but the ride to the ending is exciting and very messy, well done John.  <br />A little too violent in some respects but very highly recommended as it is a hard book to put down.

Fully equipped with the weponery and small aircraft per \\"Soufriere\\" she was to be one of a class.  However just like everything french, she was expensive to build and when the dark clouds of war began to fall on Europe, France's decisionto go ahead with the construction of the class came far too late.  <br />Based in Indochina (thus avoiding German capture)and used by the free french navy this real \\"Soufriere\\" escaped the Japanese but came to grief at the mouth of the Panama Canal after colliding with a supply ship some time in 1942.

Which in the end would have pushed aside Great Britain as the heart of a global empire.<br />Aviation, Radio, Television, Computer technology, Entertainment and all the things that we take for granted today would still have existed in the NAU late 20th century, you can't stop human development.... Anyhow the storyline WAS good and apart from silly little things such as cross country airship travel (more useful for overseas services)and some stupid names for cities (New Liverpool? England would have kept L.A. although Astoria instead of Chicago does have a nice ring to it.), proved to be a good read.<br />Based on an assasination attempt on the visiting King Charles by Irish trouble makers, the plot soon thickens into a more broader storyline that involves a young detective, a very clever woman and an adventure that is enjoyable to follow.<br />From the start, famous people of our reality are represented in this storyline and are all linked together with a great and sometimes humorous plot. All over a stolen painting with a nasty surprise inbedded in it.<br />No doubt to that fact that Harry Turtledove's excellent record of mastering alternate history was used.	2002-08-23

My introduction to the topsey-turvey world of Harry Turtledove-The Great War Walk In Hell-soon had me hooked on this great storyline reaching back to the beginning with How Few Remain and subsequently, American Front.<br />A whole new world was laid out in front of me and I'm glad it's fantasy. There are few worse scenarios that would have topped the cataclysmic changes to the state of world affairs than that of the creation of the CSA.<br />As I have stated in my other reviews of this epic storyline, Walk In Hell introduced me to the strong cast of characters that Mr Turtledove has essembled.  <br />However the storyline is free flowing and easy to grasp for those-such as myself- who picked this book up and read it without any inclination of an exciting past.<br />The events depicted are clear and quite possible as Harry Turtledove keeps basic reality in check.  I was pleasently surprised to met General Armstrong Custer, a reminder to those that events could have been different.<br />This book is set in a time when the world was still ruled by empires and dictated to accordingly.  <br />The USA is still reeling under the anger of losing and having to wear the thought of living next to the CSA, a country with the backing of Great Britan and France, and Canada to the north.<br />Smoat twice in it's history by this abborhation of international affairs, the USA has found and is using her ally, Imperial Germany.<br />This time the tide looks to be turning in the USA's favor, the CSA is fighting insurreccction by it's long suffering black population and new weapons of mass distruction, gas and the new fangled \\"Barrel\\" are unleshed with the all too familair consequences.<br />The story ends on a knife edge and you are left hanging for more...\\"Breakthroughs\\".<br />Naturally you would track back into the past and read How Few Remain and American Front to get a jest on this amazing history.<BR>	2002-08-22

Before reviewing this edition I would like to say that it was the immediate companion \\"Walk In Hell\\" that I read first so I have treated \\"How Few Remain\\" and this masterpiece \\"American Front\\" first of the Great War trilogy as prequils.<br />This edition locked into place the start of the Great War and the link to the Second Mexican war.<br />In reality Harry Turtledove should have placed a bridging novel between \\"How Few Remain\\" and this one to cover the years 1882 - 1913 with a little more depth.  It would have been nice to see how the Confederacy coped with freeing the slaves, the rise of Teddy Roosevelt and the San Fransisco earthquake. <br />As with How Few Remain we are given the reason for the global situation the Turtledove world is in at present(sic). A reminder that the USA's hand was forced into submission by Great Britan and France.<br />Now the USA has entered the European war thus making it a global conflict, on the side of Germany, with revenge against those that weakened it. The CSA, France, Great Britan and Canada.<br />Faces from How Few Remain show up but as time has moved on they have become older and in some cases, none the wiser. <br />Roosevelt is a tough hard hitting president and his most senior General, Custor, a bombastic and defiant old man. The two strong personalities enevitable collide after years of resentment...<br />New Characters make an appearance and some faces will become all too familiar over the next twenty or so years.<br />It is the first time that the CSA slave/labor issue finally gets a conclusion that leads to bloodshed and anarchy that will start to derail the CSA. Once again watch the map, it's going to change.<br />The variation on Utah \\"Beehive Nation\\" is good but I found it unbelievable that one of reality's most loyal member states of the USA is given such a hard time in this edition as it had in the previous. However we are introduced to one of the conflicts more colorful characters - Gordon McSweeny.<br />We are introduced to a gunnery saregent fighting for the CSA, Jake Featherston, a US fisherman called George Enos, a CSA steel worker named Jefferson Pinkard, a CSA submarianer Cpt Kincad, a US pilot Moss fighting in the cold skies of Canada.<br />Once again a strong female cast is repersented and they all come to the fore including the most formidible of all, Anne Collerton...watch this space!<br />Lots more faces inside including to totally different Canadian Families and the variations on their lives which have to suffer the rigours of war and a suprise outcome.<br />A free flowing and exciting storyline that ends on a high.

I stumbled across Harry Turtledove by the front cover of \\"Walk In Hell\\", the second book of the Great War trilogy. I picked the book up and started reading.  Within no time I was hooked on the intriuging story line.<br />This left me with no choice but to \\"back track\\" to American Front which then told me to back track further to How Few Remain.<br />For me it was a prequil to Walk In Hell and I was impressed with the introduction of the reason why the CSA now existed.  It showed us how close reality for our world came to changing. The North American map at the front is a great guide and will change dramatically over the next sixty odd years.<br />The what might have been scenario if the USA had've held together was well played out - a classic alternate history play on the actual.<br />Famous people of the times are thrown into a whole new world.<BR>The central charcters of Armstrong Custer and Theodore Roosevelt and their bitter dislike for each other are established in the first of this epic story of the alternate world Turtledove has created, an upside down state of world affairs.<br />Prehaps a little more could've been focussed at the start on the final battle that would turn the tide in favour of the creation of the CSA and the role Great Britan and France would play.<br />Thankfully reality is the world we live in now, not perfect but look at the possible alternative.<BR> <BR>It leaves you wondering if Great Britan would've become the enemy of the USA if secession had've succeeded. Personally I'd doubt it but we (thankfully) will never know that outside the world of Harry Turtledove...A great start with a twisted ending, the storyline flows along quite nicely and is an easy read (sadly the follow up editions post WW1 do tend to fail in this department). <BR>Five stars *****	2002-08-05

Eventually here I am at the end of the second book in the American Empire series.<br />Sadly I have to say that the ending was somewhat predictible and I found it lacking in stability of a good story line. <br />Japan attacking America was far too early for my liking and would Harry please deal to Anne Collerton. She is now so boring and that even I flicked through her chapters with total non challance.<br />A brief burst of excitment in a somewhat mundain storyline was the obvious inclusion of one Adolf Hitler, although not named. <br />Good to see Utah flareing up again. However Sonora looks likely to pull a few suprises if anything in this book was to go by.<br />On the whole the series is bogged down in the throws of the \\"tween wars\\" years and finishing at 1933 was somewhat annoying. 1936 would have been a better year, the CSA hosting the Olympic Games prehaps.<br /> Too many characters remain and should have been left out (albeit temporarally), if not killed off just to give a more focused story line.(some new fresh face wouldn't go amiss either)<br />Jake Featherston is going to be the anchor for the next book(s)and I hope that the third edition hurries us into the enevidable...WW2.<br />All in all a little too predictable, and somewhat dull but for a Turtledove fan, necessary reading to keep the chain of global events going.<br />Roll on Victorious Opposition!	2002-08-03

Suddenly all of our insecurities began to take on new meaning as America and her allies were caught totally off guard by this new terror.<br />However the human suffering that New York had to bear and it's dogged determination to rise up out of the ruins of 9/11 were clearly and, dear I say it, beautifuly executed by the photographers of the world famous Magnum organisation.<br />Fate would have it that Magnum's great photographers were in New York for a meeting when the two 767s roared in overhead...<br />The human feeling they captured that day will live on in infamy for the next 100 years and will become part of the human story told for the next 10 000 years.<br />What was witnessed that day was the determination of a great city, a great country and a great people faced with an adverse situation that only a great democracy like the United States of America can cope with. <br />Sit down to view this work and try to hold back the tears.<br />Five Stars, well done Magnum.	2002-06-15

When Blood And Iron arrived on my doorstep I have just put down Breakthroughs.<br />Continuing with the survivors of the Great War trilogy and their adjustments into post war life was, rather naturally, a come down from the high intensity of the Great War trilogy.<br />Jake Featherston's anger has dragged a few of the charcters who would otherwise never had met together. It also showed up the sheer self-centered selfishness of Anne Collerton, dragging brother with her.<br />Nellie Semproch going through motherhood again and hiding her dark secret from her husband was a good temperence for a woman who, like Anne Collerton and Silvia Enos, show the fortitude of women in this era.<br />The end of Ted Roosevelt and the rise of socialisim will have the enevidible result, if it is followed, the 1929 crash!<br />Roger Kimbell's comuppence wasn't all that surprising but Custer's survival was, when will he die!!<br />Lots more to write about. But I will only be spoiling the fun.<br />Generally a parallel of the 1920's, sometimes a little slow, I look foward to The Center Can Not Hold as we start to wind up towards the 1930s and beyond. I have pre-ordered, you shold too.	2002-03-29

It was great to catch up with all the Great War family again.<br />The United States on top at last!!! Sweet revenge for all after 54 years!<br />I particulary liked the growing inbitterment of Jake Featherston and his resentment against the Confederate establishment. Naturally a parallel to Adolf Hitler - watch this space!<br />The dealings of the Collerton clan and their fight against the Congaree Reds drew to it's enevidable conclusion and the sad outcome of the CSS Bonefish verses USS Erricson left you feeling hollow and seeking revenge.<br />The comical adventures of the righteous Gordon McSweeny sadly ended with this book. It would have been nice if he was to have survived the Great War. But thats the whole idea of this trilogy. <br />I looked foward to the first of the new American Empire trilogy, as it arrived just as I put down Breakthroughs - and the excerpt from Bold and Iron and the end was just what I needed. <br />A word of warning, you can't put this book down once you start reading.
