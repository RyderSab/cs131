It is a monumental feat. I do believe that fewer people care about science than when John and I were kids and the passion was to explore space. We all wanted to do it and science is what was going to take us there. Now even many of the scientists I meet are boring or bored. But John Vacca has rescued us from the mundane views of science that we are barraged with on the six o'clock news. The Worlds 20 Greatest Unsolved Problems is exciting, challenging, informative, provocative, and above all it is interesting! Great Job! <br /> <br />Michael Erbschloe <br />Publisher, The Future of Terrorism	2004-07-30

One of the ways to add a greater level of security for technology is to add more technology. However, the barrage of security alternatives in and of itself is often confusing. <br />Although PKI holds a lot of promise, it is a definite example of a technology that needs greater explanation. Fortunately John Vacca has managed to shed light on a PKI. I highly recommend the book to anybody who is considering adding PKI to their security efforts. <br />Michael Erbschloe<BR>Alexandria, Virginia	2004-06-01

Societies have become vulnerable to new types of security threats. The privacy of individual citizens is easily compromised. Trash dumps are becoming filled with computer junk and dirty recycling operations have cropped up around the world that endanger people and the environment. People that use computers extensively can suffer from sever eyestrain and physical pains because ergonomics is so often ignored. In many organizations well-educated professional information technology workers have been forced into sweatshop conditions of long hours and often unpaid overtime. <br />This is all happening because so many individuals, corporations, and governments do not understand the consequences of the widespread use of information technology. \\"Socially Responsible IT Management\\" guides people on how to get a grip on information technology and mitigate these undesirable and unhealthy consequences. <br />This book is very focused on issues that impact today's IT environment and solutions to address contemporary social issues.

Heller has done a superb job exploring the emergence of super-sexy figures and the ultra-erotic images used in modern advertising. <br />The average  grocery store-sold magazine of today has more sex in it than any male  magazine sold during the 1960s or 1970s. Why? Because people love sex and  they love sexual images. <br />The allure or sexual advertising has become a  fixture in the weaving of personal and societal fantasy. And this is one of  the reasons why sex is such an effective selling and marketing tool.
